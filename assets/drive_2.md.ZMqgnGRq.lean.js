History The band's original lineup, consisting of Spencer Moody, Dann Gallucci, Derek Fudesco, Coady Willis, and Nate Manny, formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1996. Gabe Kerbrat was their permanent roadie, and was considered a member. Within a year, the band had released two singles, Three Natural Sixes (Hopscotch Records #5) and Dance Hall Music (Empty Records MTR-354), and signed with the Die Young Stay Pretty label, a subsidiary of Sub Pop. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1997. In 1998, the band released Empty Bottles, Broken Hearts, its second full-length album. This release saw a greatly increased use of electric organ, and in the same year they recruited Leslie Hardy as their full-time keyboard player. Hardy had previously played bass guitar for several Seattle bands, including several months in Hole. The Murder City Devils then embarked on a year-long tour of North America to support the record. During that tour, they played with At the Drive-In, Pearl Jam, The Black Halos, Modest Mouse (for whom Dann Gallucci also played guitar), and Built to Spill. After a short break, the band released In Name and Blood in 2000, with photos in the liner notes notoriously depicting every member as a murder victim. They also appeared as both individual actors as well as a band in David Larson's independent film The Edge of Quarrel. The band released the Thelema EP in 2001. Mid-tour, keyboardist Leslie Hardy left the band. Later that year the band broke up due to circumstances surrounding Hardy's departure. (The Stranger Sept 27 – Oct 3, 2001 issue, It's My Party column by Kathleen Wilson). Hardy was replaced by Nick Dewitt for their final concerts. Bassist Derek Fudesco agreed to leave the band in September 2001 to focus on his own new band, Pretty Girls Make Graves. The band's farewell concert on Halloween 2001 (October 31) at Seattle's Showbox Theater was recorded and released by Sub Pop in 2003, titled 'R.I.P.' and included two previously unrecorded songs. It was also released on DVD in 2005. =Return= In 2006 the band announced they were playing a July show in Seattle with all original members. The band performed on July 29 at the Capitol Hill Block Party closing the two-day music festival on Saturday night. The day following the Block Party performance the band played a show with The Blood Brothers at The Showbox in downtown Seattle, the same venue where \\"R.I.P.\\" was recorded. The show was not announced until the end of their set at the Block Party. The next show was Saturday, November 3rd at Mowhawk in Austin, Texas with The Peabodys and Hex Dispensers while in town for Fun Fun Fun Fest, on November 3–4, 2007 in Austin, Texas.\\"Official Fun Fun Fun Fest lineup announced.\\" Punknews.org.

Traditionally it has not been well received by scholars, but recent translators and editors (such as Levine 1997 and Rubenstein 2002) have shown it to contain important original material. Dei gesta was a radical departure for the type of literary work for Guibert who had previously worked on theological tracts. He decided to undertake a history of the crusade, he says, after he read an anonymous eyewitness account called Gesta Francorum. In the eyes of Guibert this work was rough and simple and \\"frequently left the reader stunned with its insipid vacuity\\" (Dei gesta, preface). Guibert felt a much higher standard of grammar and diction was needed. He also inserted into the account of the First Crusade anti-Jewish rhetoric. There were some who believed it was best to leave the writing of history to those who had actually seen the events themselves, and thus were critical of Guibert's project. Guibert himself had said as much about 10 years earlier in a preachers manual. However he justified the book by saying if \\"someone objects to me that I have not seen, he can not object that I have not heard--for I truly believe that hearing is, in a way, almost as good as seeing.\\" (Dei gesta, preface). Guibert personally knew crusaders, had grown up with crusaders, and had talked with them about their memories and experiences on their return. Crusade historians have traditionally not been forthcoming with favourable reviews of Guibert's narrative. The fact that he stays so close to the original Gesta Francorum, and the difficulty of his Latin, make it seem superfluous. Recent editors and translators, however, have called attention to his excellent writing and original material. More importantly, Dei gesta provides invaluable information about the reception of the crusade in France, both for the general public and Guibert's own personal reactions to the stories he heard from returning crusaders. Guibert was a rare eyewitness to the preachings of Peter the Hermit for whom he felt nothing but contempt. The hermit, he says, walked barefoot and ate no bread, but he did drink wine and eat fish - criticism of an itinerant hermit from the monastic Guibert. When Peter fled the siege of Antioch, most chroniclers glossed over Peter's flight, but Guibert spared no measure when he wrote this mocking song, wondering why Peter could not withstand the starving pressures of a siege: ::Stand firm! Remember your life as a hermit, ::Your old customary fasts! ::Hitherto you have been skin and bone. ::You've had no choice but to eat grass with the cattle ::Your grumbling stomach calmed with uncooked roots. ::How could you now remember gluttonous feasts? ::--Dei gesta Dei gesta was not only a historical narrative but contained moral instruction; the reader might learn lessons for his own spiritual quest. It also contained elements of prophecy, discussing how the crusade was part of the larger divine plan. Thus it was a medieval allegory work containing the four elements of allegory: literal, typological, moral, and anagogical. Like the Bible, it worked on different levels at the same time.

Spratling with Candlesticks, 1935. William Spratling (September 22, 1900 – August 7, 1967) was an American-born silver designer and artist, best known for his influence on 20th century Mexican silver design. Early life Spratling was born in 1900 in Sonyea, Livingston County, New York, the son of epileptologist William P. Spratling. After the deaths of Spratling's mother and sister, he moved to his father's boyhood home outside of Auburn, Alabama. Spratling graduated from Auburn High School and the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (currently known as Auburn University), where he majored in architecture. CareerArchitecture professor and lecturer= Upon graduation, Spratling took a position as an instructor in the architecture department at Auburn University, and in 1921 he was offered a similar position at Tulane University's School of Architecture in New Orleans, Louisiana.William Spratling, File on Spratling (Boston and Toronto: Little, Brown and Company, 1967): 6-8. At the same time, he was an active participant in the Arts and Crafts Club and taught in the New Orleans Art School. During the summers of 1926-1928, Spratling lectured on colonial architecture at the National University of Mexico's Summer School. =SilverworkTaller de las Delicias The highly charged political and social environment in Mexico after the revolution influenced Spratling's decision in 1931 to reestablish a silver industry in Taxco. Taxco was a traditional site of silver mines, but had no native silverworking industry. Spratling began designing works in silver based primarily on pre-Columbian and traditional motifs, and hired local goldsmiths to produce those designs in Taxco. Spratling was the primary designer for his workshop, Taller de las Delicias, and was insistent on the high quality of the materials and techniques used in production. Talented maestros shared in the creative dialogue with Spratling, transforming his design drawings into prototypes in silver. Spratling's use of an aesthetic vocabulary based on pre-Columbian art can be compared to the murals of Diego Rivera, in that both artists were involved in the creation of a new cultural identity for Mexico. Primarily, Spratling's silver designs drew upon pre- conquest Mesoamerican motifs, with influence from other native and Western cultures. To many, his work served as an expression of Mexican nationalism, and gave Mexican artisans the freedom to create designs in non-European forms. Because of his influence on the silver design industry in Mexico, Spratling has been called the \\"Father of Mexican Silver\\". The forms that evolved in silver at Las Delicias were admired by visitors to the workshop, who purchased the objects as talismans of a remote and exotic culture. Wholesale In the late thirties, Spratling expanded beyond sales at Las Delicias and into a wholesale business. He employed over 500 artisans in the workshop to meet the demand in the United States for luxury good during World War II. Spratling silver was sold through the Montgomery Ward catalog and at Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. With the cost of moving the workshop to an ancient silver hacienda, La Florida, Spratling incorporated to provide cash flow for his company. On June 30, 1945, a majority of the shares was sold to North American investor Russell Maguire, whose business practices ultimately took the company into bankruptcy.Penny C. Morrill and Carole A. Berk, Mexican Silver: 20th Century Handwrought Jewelry and Silver (Atglen, PA: Schiffer Publishing, Ltd., 4th edition, 2007): 50-54 Alaska Native Arts Spratling had received widespread notoriety as a result of his development of what many considered a model handwrought industry. In 1945, Spratling was asked by two friends, Alaska's Territorial Governor, Ernest Gruening, and the Director of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, Rene d'Harnoncourt, to replicate his success in Alaska.William Spratling, File on Spratling (Boston and Toronto: Little, Brown and Company, 1967): 126-140; Penny C. Morrill and Carole A. Berk, Mexican Silver: 20th Century Handwrought Jewelry and Silver (Atglen, PA: Schiffer Publishing, Ltd., 4th Edition, 2007): 54-56, 60-67 Spratling recommended the establishment of workshop and exhibit centers in various regions of Alaska organized into a Federation of Alaska Native Arts. Each center's unique production would be born out of the traditions in iconography, materials, and techniques belonging to that specific region.Records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. RG 75.

Report: A Plan for Organizing the Crafts and Smaller Industries (all Manual or Semi-Manual Production) and a Policy for their Constant Future Development in Alaska, Oct. 1945 In 1948, Alaskan World War II veterans were sent to Taxco for instruction in silversmithing. Spratling also produced 200 prototypes as future inspiration for the newly trained Alaskans in their workshop centers.RG 75, File 969. Spratling to Tony Polet, Oct. 26, 1948; Foster to Gov. Gruening, Nov. 8, 1948; Foster to William Zimmerman, Nov. 10, 1948. These prototypes are now in the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian and the Alaska State Museum. See Penny C. Morrill, editor and author, Maestros de Plata: William Spratling and the Mexican Silver Renaissance {Harry N. Abrams, Inc., with the San Antonio Museum of Art, 2002}: 38-39 Unfortunately, Congress did not allocate funds and the project was not implemented. Taxco workshop In 1952, Spratling reestablished a small workshop at his ranch in Taxco el Viejo and began production of silver jewelry and decorative objects that clearly were influenced by his Alaskan experience. In a 1955 article, \\"25 Years of Mexican Silverware,\\" Spratling expressed his belief that the object in silver should be considered the culmination of a mystical and visionary process.William Spratling, \\"25 Years of Mexican Silverware,\\" Artes de Mexico, Vol. III, No. 10 (1955): 90 For Spratling, the necessity of direct human involvement in every phase of a handwrought industry meant there were contributions to be made by every maestro and silversmith. The designer continuously interacted with and was aware of the capabilities of members of the workshop. The final statement, the object itself, was a result of an ongoing experiment in creativity. Silver works Spratling's earliest work can be characterized as inspired expressions in silver, resembling the power of the reliefs on the Temple of Quetzalcoatl at Xochicalco or the pre-Columbian clay stamps he admired.Spratling sent his friend, Tulane University archaeologist Frans Blom, imprints of his clay stamps in 1938. These are housed in the Latin American Library at Tulane University. See also Penny C. Morrill, editor and author, Maestros de Plata: William Spratling and the Mexican Silver Renaissance {Harry N. Abrams, Inc., with the San Antonio Museum of Art, 2002}: 24. The designs incorporate sinuous lines that were deeply carved, with strong light and shadow contrasts. The inspiration from pre-Columbian models could be direct, as in the repousse Quetzalcoatl brooch, based on the heart bowl in the Museo Nacional de Antropología, or indirect, like the silver pitcher with the eagle handle in carved wood.Penny C. Morrill, editor and author, Maestros de Plata: William Spratling and the Mexican Silver Renaissance {Harry N. Abrams, Inc., with the San Antonio Museum of Art, 2002}: 167. Spratling marked his earliest work with a simple interlocking WS. After 1938, he began using a circular mark with the WS sans-serifs at its center, around which read \\"Spratling Made in Mexico\\". This mark was accompanied, up until 1945, with an oval in which was imprinted, \\"Spratling Silver\\". The Alaska pieces and work from c. 1950 were marked with a simple script \\"WS\\". Spratling also collaborated briefly (1949–51) with the Mexico City silver company Conquistador, and these pieces were marked with a circle in which was inscribed \\"Spratling de [or of] Mexico\\" and across, \\"Sterling\\". The eagle or assay mark for the Conquistador pieces contained the number 13, and for Spratling, the numbers 1 or 30.Penny C. Morrill, editor and author, Maestros de Plata: William Spratling and the Mexican Silver Renaissance {Harry N. Abrams, Inc., with the San Antonio Museum of Art, 2002}: 255-256 for Spratling's maker's marks. Another source of information for Spratling's marks is the website, \\"Spratling Silver\\", authored by Phyllis Goddard: http://www.spratlingsilver.com/. Spratling's later work is more linear and refined. The croissant necklace has a great deal of movement, but now based on abstract form. Spratling's maker's mark in this period once again took the form of a circle, this time with the script \\"WS\\" surrounded by the words, \\"William Spratling Taxco Mexico\\". In the 1960s, Spratling began producing jewelry in gold with pre-Columbian stones. Each piece was unique and marked with a simple \\"WS\\" beneath \\"18K\\".Drawings for a number of these unique gold jewelry designs are now in the Spratling-Taxco Collection in Tulane University's Latin American Library. Published works * In 1926 Spratling collaborated with William Faulkner on Sherwood Anderson And Other Famous Creoles, a series of caricatures depicting the bohemian atmosphere of artists and writers living and working in the French Quarter in the 1920s.William Spratling, File on Spratling (Boston and Toronto: Little, Brown and Company, 1967): 13, 16-30, 34-35; William Spratling and William Faulkner, Sherwood Anderson and Other Famous Creoles, New Orleans, 1926; Penny C. Morrill and Carole A. Berk, Mexican Silver: 20th Century Handwrought Jewelry and Silver (Atglen, PA: Schiffer Publishing, Ltd., 4th edition, 2007): 17-18; 256-257. * In 1927, Spratling did illustrations for his good friend Natalie Scott's Old Plantation Houses in Louisiana. The balanced interaction between illustration and text was characteristic of all of Spratling's published work. In Plantation Houses, the renderings of the buildings are as descriptive as Natalie Scott's narrative, which, when taken together, transport the reader into settings where people lived out their lives.Natalie Scott and William Spratling, Old Plantation Houses in Louisiana, New York: William Helburn, Inc., 1927. Also see John W. Scott, Natalie Scott: A Magnificent Life, Gretna, LA: Pelican Publishing Co., 2008 * In a 1928 article for Scribner's Magazine, Spratling had sensitively portrayed the people of Isle Breville, Louisiana.William Spratling, \\"Cane River Portraits\\", Scribner's Magazine, Vol. LXXXIII, No. 1 (January 1928): 411-418. * Little Mexico was published in 1932 and is considered his most significant literary work.William Spratling, Little Mexico, New York: Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1932. The same qualities of observation by Spratling for the 1928 articles are present and compelling in Little Mexico. In the following passage, Spratling comes close to defining the intensity of his encounters: \\"To rub shoulders with the Indian population, to see them smiling and occupied, eating their simple meals, arguing agrarian problems over a cup of tequila, arranging themselves on the ground for the night, and, above all, to witness their dances and to observe the mystery of the faces of the dancers - is a profound experience.\\"William Spratling, Little Mexico, New York: Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith, 1932, 69, 84-5 Personal life While teaching at Tulane, Spratling shared a house with writer William Faulkner. When lecturing at the National University of Mexico's Summer School in 1926-1928, Spratling quickly integrated himself into the Mexican art scene and became a friend and a strong proponent of the work of muralist Diego Rivera, for whom he organized an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Using money received from commissions he organized for Rivera, Spratling bought a home in Taxco, Mexico in 1928, where he began work on a book, Little Mexico, about this small mountain town. Spratling was gay, but most accounts of his life mention this only indirectly if at all. Spratling amassed a large collection of pre-Columbian figurines from Remojadas, Veracruz, which he donated, in large part, to the museum of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1959. Photographed by Manuel Álvarez Bravo, several of these works were published in More Human Than Divine.William Spratling, More Human than Divine: An Intimate and Lively Self-Portrait in Clay of a Smiling People from Ancient Vera Cruz (Mexico: Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, 1960): 11-13 Spratling also donated hundreds of pre- Columbian objects to a museum in Taxco that today bears his name.

Among her extensive works are the dynamic roundels of Dance, Drama, and Song at Radio City Music Hall, the Creation cycle and stained-glass windows at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church (Manhattan), the iconographic suites at the Nebraska State Capitol, and the National Academy of Sciences.Catherine Coleman Brawer and Kathleen Murphy Skolnik, The Art Deco Murals of Hildreth Meiere: Andrea Monfried Editions, 2014. Biography Hildreth Meière was born in New York City in 1892. After studying at New York's Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart, Meiere studied in Florence. Upon studying the works of the Renaissance Masters, she is quoted as saying, \\"After that I could not be satisfied with anything less than a big wall to paint on. I just had to be a mural painter.\\"Don Chandler, Hildreth Meiere Profile She furthered her studies at the Art Students League of New York, California School of Fine Arts, San Francisco (now San Francisco Art Institute), the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, New York School of Applied Design for Women and the Beaux Arts Institute of Design.McGee, Celia. If These Walls Could Speak, They'd Say Her Name. New York Times, May 2, 2014. C19, C28-C29. After training as a mapmaker, Meière served her country as a draftsman in the U.S. Navy with the rating of Yeoman (F) during World War I. Finding work in a male-dominated field was difficult for her, so she began her career as a costume designer for theater actresses, a field more common for women at the time. In 1923 she was commissioned to decorate the dome of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. by architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue.Lauren Knapp, Slide Show: New Exhibit Brings Mosaic of Hildreth Meière's Life Out of Obscurity, PBS, 5nApril 2011 Meiere and sculptor Lee Lawrie became members of the loose \\"repertory company\\" of artists assembled by Goodhue, and she came to work on many different projects with him. One of these, the Nebraska State Capitol in Lincoln, which she began before the NAS dome was even completed, became her pièce de résistance featuring eight separate examples of her work.National Building Museum, Walls Speak: The Narrative Art of Hildreth Meière , 2011 During Meiere's successful career, spanning 30 years and working on over 100 commissions, she became well known for contributing well-integrated public art mosaics to many landmark buildings and is most closely associated with the Art Deco movement. Some of Meiere's best work is visible throughout her hometown of Manhattan, although reportedly she was proudest of her work on the Nebraska State Capitol. When World War II broke out, Meiere served on the Citizen's Committee for the Army and Navy, providing portable altar pieces for military chaplains. This campaign created over 500 mobile triptychs, 70 of her own design which could be used on base-camps, battleships, and hospitals worldwide. She taught first aid for the Red Cross after the US entered World War II.Hildreth Meiere, Biography, International Hildreth Meiere Association, c. 1955. Asked how to say her name, she told The Literary Digest (which spelled the name Meière) \\"It is of French origin and I pronounce it mee-AIR. My father's family anglicized the pronunciation to meer, but I have always used the more proper form.\\"Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk & Wagnalls, 1936. Professional organizations In Meiere's autobiography, she states, \\"Having begun at the top with the National Academy of Sciences and the Nebraska State Capitol, the long list of commissions, well over a hundred, have come of themselves. For the past thirty-five years I have maintained a large studio and have supported myself by my work. . . . I have [also] been active in professional organizations, believing that we owe some of our time and energies to them.\\" Her artistic merit was well recognised by her peers, but what makes her career most notable was the pioneering influence she had as a woman in a time where men dominated every profession. She was the first woman ever appointed to the New York City Art Commission, and she came to found the Liturgical Arts Society in her 57th Street studio in New York, serving as the organization's first president. She served four terms as President of the National Society of Mural Painters; six terms as First Vice President of the Architectural League of New York; Director of the Municipal Art Society; Director of the Department of Mural Painting at the Beaux Arts Institute of Design; member of the Architectural Guild of America; and a board member of the Art Students League, the Municipal Arts Society, the School Art League, and the Advisory Committee of the Cooper Union Art School, all in New York. Awards and recognition Her first major award came in recognition for one of her first major projects. In 1928, a full six years before the Architectural League of New York admitted female members, the organisation awarded Meiere with a gold medal in Mural Decoration for her work at the Nebraska State Capitol. The U.S. War Department gave her an award for the work she did with the Citizens Committee for the Army and Navy during World War II. In 1956, she became the first woman to win the Fine Arts Medal of the American Institute of Architects. Manhattanville College, Meiere's alma mater, presented her with an honorary doctorate in 1953, and in 1959 the school presented here with a distinguished service award.

He is also known in Japan as , is known in America as Starman, and known in France and Italy as Spaceman. Japan's first onscreen superhero Whereas Takeo Nagamatsu's 1930 kamishibai The Golden Bat (Ōgon Batto) was Japan's first modern superhero (and had many manga, anime and film adaptations), Shintoho's Super Giant was the first celluloid superhero (theatrically released in 1957), and the role model for many Japanese superheroes to come, especially Ultraman and Kamen Rider. Named \\"Super Giants\\" (plural), although the main character was only one person and obviously human- sized, the series' title was no doubt inspired by the American Adventures of Superman (which was then being broadcast in Japan) and the famous Japanese baseball team, the Yomiuri Giants (who were extremely popular at the time). Moonlight Mask (Gekkō Kamen) became Japan's first made-for-television superhero when his TV show debuted in 1958, but Super Giant was Japan's first theatrical superhero series. Character background Super Giant is a human- like being created from the strongest steel by the Peace Council of the Emerald Planet. He is created to destroy evil and restore peace in the universe. Resembling a Japanese man in white tights/cowl (fitted with an antenna) and capes under his arms, he is virtually indestructible. He wears on his wrist a \\"Globe-Meter\\" device, which enables him to: *Fly through space *Detect radiation *Speak and understand any language He can also use it to disguise himself as an Earthling to walk among them. When sent to Earth to fight evildoers, he disguises himself as a Japanese man wearing an ordinary suit and fedora hat (looking almost like a police detective), but still uses his \\"Super Giant\\" name. His secret identity is not that secret, as he works with the Japanese authorities to help them fight evildoers. He is just as powerful in his civilian form. He also gets along with Earth children, and saves them from danger, as he knows that children represent the Earth's future. After accomplishing his mission, Super Giant always flies back to the Emerald Planet. Super Giant was played in all nine films by respected film/TV actor Ken Utsui. However, Utsui hated playing Super Giant and, right up to his death, always played down the role. This was partially on account of the somewhat embarrassing costume, especially the overstuffed crotch area (he said the producers thought that female viewers were attracted to well-endowed men, so they stuffed the crotch area of Utsui's costume with cotton). Whatever Utsui's feelings about the role, his earnest and heroic interpretation of the character made lasting impact on a generation's children all over the world.

Trivia: It was after this film was made that director Teruo Ishii left the series, upon hearing of a child who imitated Super Giant (even wearing a hand-made cape) by jumping out of a window and landing on the street below, seriously injuring himself. This became a controversial liability issue with Japanese superhero programs (not unlike those in America), until shows like Android Kikaider (1972) added a safety bumper at the end of each episode, telling children not to imitate the impossible feats performed by the title superhero. This was the last Super Giant film with a two-part story arc; the remaining films were stand-alone episodes, and none of them from this point on were directed by Teruo Ishii. = Super Giant 7 = Super Giant - The Space Mutant Appears (スーパー・ジャイアンツ 宇宙怪人出現 - Sūpā Jaiantsu - Uchū Kaijin Shutsugen) is a 1958 black and white Japanese film directed by Akira Mitsuwa.

Stock Generation allowed people to trade \\"virtual companies\\" using real money and promised enormous returns on investment. History The website was run from an island in the Caribbean, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was unable to cite Stock Generation's founders and owners (members of the Russian conglomerate MMM) for securities violations. In late 1999, participants began to experience difficulties in redeeming their virtual shares. Finally, in 2000, the market \\"crashed\\". On March 20, 2000, SG unilaterally suspended all pending requests to withdraw funds and sharply reduced participants' account balances in all companies except the privileged company. (Applying \\"Rule 13\\" to all participants' accounts.) Two weeks later, SG peremptorily announced a reverse stock split for its highest-yield company, applying \\"Rule 18\\", which caused the share prices to plummet to less than 1/10,000 of their previous values, while other shares (including those that were \\"guaranteed\\" not to decrease in value) were devalued by 50% to 95%. At about the same time, SG stopped responding to participant requests for the return of funds, yet continued to solicit new participants through its website.Virtual investment gaming leads to SEC prosecution The SEC then sued in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that the \\"virtual stock exchange\\" was in effect a Ponzi scheme.SG Ltd. (Stock Generation Ltd.) et al. The court ruled in favor of Stock Generation, stating that the site adequately described the market as \\"a game\\" not an investment vehicle. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit later reversed the District Court, stating that \\"the opportunity to invest in the shares of the privileged company, described on SG's website, constituted an invitation to enter into an investment contract within the jurisdictional reach of the federal securities laws.\\" The game was shut down around June 1, 2000. Operation StockGeneration website traded shares of 11 \\"virtual\\" companies. Each of those companies had its name and logo, but they were most often referred to by the number under which they were listed. Companies 1 to 8 were traded for purely \\"gambling\\" purposes, as their shares could go up and down randomly. Having those 8 companies \\"trading\\" on their website, allowed StockGeneration to claim its enterprise as online gambling venture, rather than an actual stock market or any other investment-related business to which SEC rules would apply. Company 9 was the \\"privileged\\" company, with its shares \\"guaranteed\\" never to decrease in value. Promised return was originally 10% a month (215% annually,) but was later reduced to 7% a month or 125% annually. In early April 2000, Stock Generation, despite all previous guarantees, devalued its privileged company shares to 5% of their previous value. Companies 10 and 11 promised monthly returns of 50% and 100% (later 40% and 70%) respectively. At the same time, share prices could plummet 50% for company 10 and 100% (e.g. all the way down to 0) for company 11. That caveat (known as Rule 18) was another way for StockGeneration to justify their claims that this was a gambling website, rather than an investment vehicle. Stock Generation was reluctant to use Rule 18 throughout most of the time the game was active. Instead they chose to apply another rule (known as Rule 13) which permitted StockGeneration to reduce individual account balances by recalculating them as if all the funds had been originally invested in the \\"privileged\\" company 9. So, a user that chose to invest his $50 sign-up bonus in the company 11 shares, kept the funds there for a year and then sought to withdraw all at once, could see his balance going down from $204,800 (100% monthly rate, compounded twice a week) to $157 (10% monthly rate compounded twice a week) and his transaction history would state that he had invested all those funds in the company 9 shares rather than in the company 11. Rule 13 allowed StockGeneration to avoid massive 5- or 6- figure withdrawals, thus allowing the system to last over 2 years, with its share prices increasing over 10,000-fold. (As opposed to StockGeneration predecessor, the MMM which only lasted about 6 months, with its stock price increasing \\"only\\" 127-fold.) Judging from the complaints on the SG bulletin board, application of rule 13 had become widespread by early 2000, as demands for withdrawals increased. On March 20, 2000, Rule 13 was applied to every account. Rule 18 was applied about two weeks later, for the first time since the game was launched. The value of the company 10 share was cut in half. Company 11 shares underwent a 1-for-10,000 reverse split, with the actual share price plummeting to less than 1/100,000th of its value (from over $1 per share to $0.10 per \\"new\\" share, worth 10,000 old ones). On the same day, Stock Generation reduced the price of the company 9 shares from $16.90 to $0.84 - in clear violation of their own rules as those shares were guaranteed never to decrease in value. Stock Generation continued to operate for several weeks after that, offering returns of up to 150% a month, but further legal troubles led to their website being halted by June 1, 2000. Legal opinion The description below is a quotation of the public information from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit:Appeal of SEC vs. Stock Generation, United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit \\"StockGeneration\\" website offering on-line denizens an opportunity to purchase shares in eleven different \\"virtual companies\\" listed on the website's \\"virtual stock exchange.\\" SG arbitrarily set the purchase and sale prices of each of these imaginary companies in biweekly \\"rounds,\\" and guaranteed that investors could buy or sell any quantity of shares at posted prices. SG placed no upper limit on the amount of funds that an investor could squirrel away in its virtual offerings. The SEC's complaint focused on shares in a particular virtual enterprise referred to by SG as the \\"privileged company\\". SG advised potential purchasers to pay \\"particular attention\\" to shares in the privileged company and boasted that investing in those shares was a \\"game without any risk.\\" To this end, its website announced that the privileged company's shares would unfailingly appreciate, boldly proclaiming that \\"[t]he share price of [the privileged company] is supported by the owners of SG, this is why its value constantly rises; on average at a rate of 10% monthly (this is approximately 215% annually).\\" To add plausibility to this representation and to allay anxiety about future pricing, SG published prices of the privileged company's shares one month in advance. While SG conceded that a decline in the share price was theoretically possible, it assured prospective participants that \\"under the rules governing the fall in prices, [the share price for the privileged company] cannot fall by more than 5% in a round.\\" To bolster this claim, it vouchsafed that shares in the privileged company were supported by several distinct revenue streams. According to SG's representations, capital inflow from new participants provided liquidity for existing participants who might choose to sell their virtual shareholdings. As a backstop, SG pledged to allocate an indeterminate portion of the profits derived from its website operations to a special reserve fund designed to maintain the price of the privileged company's shares. SG asserted that these profits emanated from four sources: (1) the collection of a 1.5% commission on each transaction conducted on its virtual stock exchange; (2) the bid-ask spread on the virtual shares; (3) the \\"skillful manipulation\\" of the share prices of eight particular imaginary companies, not including the privileged company, listed on the virtual stock exchange; and (4) SG's right to sell shares of three other virtual companies (including the privileged company). As a further hedge against adversity, SG alluded to the availability of auxiliary stabilization funds which could be tapped to ensure the continued operation of its virtual stock exchange. SG's website contained lists of purported \\"big winners,\\" an Internet bulletin board featuring testimonials from supposedly satisfied participants, and descriptions of incentive programs that held out the prospect of rewards for such activities as the referral of new participants (e.g., SG's representation that it would pay \\"20, 25 or 30% of the referred player's highest of the first three payments\\") and the establishment of affiliate websites. According to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, 800 United States domiciliaries, paying real cash, purchased virtual shares in the virtual companies listed on the defendants' virtual stock exchange.

He played all or part of six seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Mets, Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros. He is best known for having lost 27 consecutive games in which he had a decision, setting an MLB record. Career Young attended Furr High School in Houston, Texas, and the University of Houston, where he played college baseball and college football for the Houston Cougars. The New York Mets selected Young in the 38th round of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft. He worked his way up through their minor league system, making his major league debut as a relief pitcher on August 5, 1991. While with the Mets, from May 6, 1992, to July 24, 1993, he lost 27 consecutive decisions. This losing streak is the longest in MLB history, breaking the mark of 23 set by Cliff Curtis in 1910–11. During the losing streak, Young converted 12 straight save opportunities and threw consecutive scoreless innings while filling in for Mets closer John Franco. During the streak, Young was 0–14 as a starter and 0–13 as a reliever. The streak ended on July 28, 1993, when he earned his first win since April 19, 1992. Over roughly the same time period from April 14, 1992, to May 1, 1994, Young—as a Met and later a Cub—made 27 consecutive starts without a win. He made 13 quality starts among those 27, but his teams went 4–23 in those games. Before the 1994 season, the Mets traded Young and minor leaguer Ottis Smith to the Chicago Cubs for José Vizcaíno. He signed with the Houston Astros for the 1996 season. Despite posting a respectable 3.89 earned run average for his career, he finished with a record of 15 wins and 48 losses for a winning percentage of .238. Personal life After retiring, Young worked for eight years in a chemical plant. He also coached youth leagues and offered pitching lessons in Kingwood, Texas. He was the father of three. In January 2017, Young revealed that he had been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. Doctors were unsure at the time if the tumor was malignant. He underwent chemotherapy and reported in February that the tumor had shrunk. On June 27, 2017, his ex-teammate, Lenny Harris, reported on social media that Young was in a coma. Later that day, Young died at the age of 51.

Johann Liss (also called Jan Lys) (c. 1590 or 1597 - 1629 or 1630) was a leading German Baroque painter of the 17th century, active mainly in Venice. Biography Liss was born in Oldenburg (Holstein) in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. After an initial education in his home state, he continued his studies, according to Houbraken, with Hendrick Goltzius in Haarlem and Amsterdam. Around 1620 he travelled through Paris to Venice. He moved to Rome around 1620–1622, and his first works there were influenced by the style of Caravaggio. Although his earlier work was concerned with the contrasts of light and shadow, his final move to Venice in the early 1620s modified his style and gave impetus to brilliant color and a spirited treatment of the painted surface. In 1627, he was created an admired large altarpiece, the Inspiration of Saint Jerome in San Nicolò da Tolentino. His loose brushstrokes seem precursor to rococo styles of Guardi brothers. This final style, along with that of other \\"foreign\\" painters residing in Venice, Domenico Fetti and Bernardo Strozzi, represent the first inroads of Baroque style into the republic. Liss fled to Verona to escape the plague spreading in Venice, but succumbed there prematurely in 1629. According to Houbraken, he worked day and night on his paintings, so that Joachim von Sandrart felt that his health was at risk and urged him to join him in Rome.Jan Lis biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature His legacy is as a painter of both sensuous mythological and pious biblical subjects, a master of colors and Baroque painting. He was most influential to Venetian 18th-century painters like Sebastiano Ricci, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Giovanni Piazzetta. Joachim von Sandrart wrote in 1675 that \\"because he fared well in Venice, he soon returned there ... he died along with many others during the plague that began in 1629.\\" Examples of work *Lute Player *Visitation of St Jerome *Vision of Saint Jerome *Peasants playing mora *Judith in the Tent of Holofernes {c.1622, National Gallery, London) *Death of Cleopatra *Abel mourned by his parents *Venus in front of mirror (1625–26, Uffizi) *Death of Phaeton *Cupid (Cleveland Art Museum, Cleveland, Ohio) References * Category:1590s births Category:17th-century deaths Category:17th-century German painters Category:German male painters Category:German Baroque painters Category:People from the Duchy of Holstein Category:Members of the Bentvueghels Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Venetian painters ","title":"Johann Liss"},{"id":"2006071","text":"The 10th Avenue Bridge crosses the Mississippi River near downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota and also in proximity to the University of Minnesota. The bridge was formerly called the Cedar Avenue Bridge from days prior to the construction of the I-35W bridge when it connected to Cedar Ave. The bridge connects 10th Avenue Southeast, on the east side of the Mississippi River to 19th Avenue South, on the west side. The bridge is considered the crowning achievement of Minneapolis city engineer Kristoffer Olsen Oustad, who was one of four prominent Norwegian-American men who designed major structures in the region.(1996). Minnesota's Historic Bridges: Cedar Avenue Bridge. Minnesota Historical Society. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, and also marks the downstream boundary of the Saint Anthony Falls Historic District. During the days immediately following the I-35W bridge collapse, the 10th Avenue Bridge was closed to traffic, then later reopened; it was one of the most used locations from which to view the wreckage and the recovery efforts. Construction on the bridge began in 1926, and it was completed in 1929. The total length is 2,174.9 feet (662.9 m), with two central spans each 265.5 feet (80.9 m) across. It has an open spandrel arch design, and it is constructed of reinforced concrete. Higher and longer than any preceding bridge in the region, it was originally 2,921 feet (890.3 m) in overall length, 698 feet (213 m) longer than the nearby Third Avenue Bridge. It stands 110 feet (33.5 m) above the water's surface. Cost of the bridge was US$891,000. A major restoration was undertaken in 1972-1976, and the approach spans were altered (they were not considered architecturally significant, even when the bridge was new). The south approach span was relocated to go straight to Washington Avenue. It was built to alleviate the traffic flows on the bridges serving downtown about a mile upstream. Roads in the vicinity were disrupted by the construction of Interstate 35W and a corresponding bridge (completed 1967; collapsed in 2007) one to two blocks upstream (the famous Seven Corners area of Minneapolis is at the south end). The downstream end of the lower Saint Anthony Falls lock and dam extends under the bridge. The historic Southeast Steam Plant is also nearby.

Together with his brother, Christian Tanna, he formed I Mother Earth around 1990. He wrote almost all of I Mother Earth's music, and produced much of it as well. He won a Juno Award in 2000 for Best Recording Engineer (with Paul Northfield) for the band's singles \\"Summertime in the Void\\" and \\"When Did You Get Back From Mars?\\". Tanna produced music for bands such as Clarknova and dodger at 'The Mother's Hip' in Toronto, and he owns the record label UpperLeftSide Music, now based out of Peterborough, Ontario. He has also co- produced Sarah Slean's album The Baroness and her recent EP The Baroness Redecorates. His latest projects are the production of his own IFC Canada show, The Rawside Of... and INXS singer J. D. Fortune's solo album, The Death of a Motivational Speaker. In early 2010, he made several comments via his personal Facebook page that he is working on new I Mother Earth material. On January 24, 2012, Tanna announced via the band's official website that the most recent lineup would reunite for two live performances in Toronto.http://imotherearth.ca/openmouth/?p=6 They have gone on to play additional shows and have released a new song.

It is one of the four isomers of butanol. tert-Butyl alcohol is a colorless solid, which melts near room temperature and has a camphor-like odor. It is miscible with water, ethanol and diethyl ether. Natural occurrence tert-Butyl alcohol has been identified in beer and chickpeas. It is also found in cassava, which is used as a fermentation ingredient in certain alcoholic beverages. Preparation tert-Butyl alcohol is derived commercially from isobutane as a coproduct of propylene oxide production. It can also be produced by the catalytic hydration of isobutylene, or by a Grignard reaction between acetone and methylmagnesium chloride. Purification cannot be performed by simple distillation due to formation of an azeotrope with water, although initial drying of the solvent containing large amounts of water is performed by adding benzene to form a tertiary azeotrope and distilling off the water. Smaller amounts of water are removed by drying with calcium oxide (CaO), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), calcium sulfate (CaSO4), or magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), followed by fractional distillation. Anhydrous tert-butyl alcohol is obtained by further refluxing and distilling from magnesium activated with iodine, or alkali metals such as sodium or potassium. Other methods include the use of 4 Å molecular sieves, aluminium tert- butylate, calcium hydride (CaH2), or fractional crystallization under inert atmosphere. Applications tert-Butyl alcohol is used as a solvent, ethanol denaturant, paint remover ingredient, and gasoline octane booster and oxygenate. It is a chemical intermediate used to produce methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) by reaction with methanol and ethanol, respectively, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) by reaction with hydrogen peroxide. Reactions As a tertiary alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol is more resistant to oxidation than the other isomers of butanol. tert-Butyl alcohol is deprotonated with a strong base to give the alkoxide. Particular common is potassium tert-butoxide, which is prepared by treating tert-butanol with potassium metal. :K + t-BuOH → t-BuO−K+ \\\\+ H2 The tert-butoxide is a strong, non-nucleophilic base in organic chemistry. It readily abstracts acidic protons from substrates, but its steric bulk inhibits the group from participating in nucleophilic substitution, such as in a Williamson ether synthesis or an SN2 reaction. tert-Butyl alcohol reacts with hydrogen chloride to form tert-butyl chloride. O-Chlorination of tert-butyl alcohol with hypochlorous acid to give tert-butyl hypochlorite: :(CH3)3COH + HOCl → (CH3)3COCl + H2O Pharmacology and Toxicology There is limited data on the pharmacology and toxicology of tert-butanol in humans and other animals. Human exposure may occur due to fuel oxygenate metabolism. Tert-butanol is poorly absorbed through skin but rapidly absorbed if inhaled or ingested. Tert- butanol is irritating to skin or eyes. Toxicity of single doses is usually low but high doses can produce a sedative or anesthetic effect.

The first version, titled Harvard Presentation Graphics was released for MS-DOS in 1986 by Software Publishing Corporation (SPC) and achieved a high market share. It was taken off the market in 2017. History Harvard Graphics was one of the first desktop business application software programs that allowed users to incorporate text, information graphics, and charts into custom slideshow presentations. The original version could import data from Lotus 1-2-3 or Lotus Symphony, charts created in Symphony or PFS Graph, and ASCII text. It could export text and graphics to Computer Graphics Metafile and to pfs:Write, also manufactured by SPC. Its use of vector graphics produced mixed results on the CGA and EGA displays common at the time, but output was usually sent to a slide printer or a color plotter. \\"Presentation\\" was dropped from the name for the second release, which came in 1987, developed by Mario Chaves, Carl Hu, Lenore Kirvay, and Dana Tom. Harvard Graphics 2.0 added the ability to import the latest Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet data before generating graphics, as well as drawing and annotations for graphs. Version 3.0 was not released until 1991, offering improved editing functions, but its graphics and export capabilities were being outperformed by competitors like Aldus Persuasion and Lotus Freelance. Harvard Graphics was used as bonus product with Windows 95 by Australian Retailer Harvey Norman. Demise The market leader through the late 1980s, Harvard Graphics struggled as the market shifted to Microsoft Windows. SPC released a version for Microsoft Windows 3.0 in 1991, but its market share never approached the 70% it had previously commanded. The Windows market came to be dominated by Microsoft PowerPoint and then the bundle of PowerPoint into Microsoft Office. In 1996, Serif purchased exclusive marketing rights to the product line of Harvard Graphics, Inc., and assumed product support responsibilities. Serif continued to market Harvard Graphics 98 for Windows and other software under the Harvard Graphics brand until mid-year 2017, when the product was taken off the market.

It is therefore also equivalent in size to the Super 35 motion picture film format, which has the dimensions of 24.89 mm × 18.66 mm (0.980 in × 0.735 in). Sensors approximating these dimensions are used in many digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs), mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs), and a few large-sensor live-preview digital cameras. APS-C size sensors are also used in a few digital rangefinders. Such sensors exist in many different variants depending on the manufacturer and camera model. All APS-C variants are considerably smaller than 35 mm standard film which measures 36×24 mm. Because of this, devices with APS-C sensors are known as \\"cropped frame,\\" especially when used in connection with lens mounts that are also used with sensors the size of 35 mm film: only part of the image produced by the lens is captured by the APS-C size sensor. Sensor sizes range from 20.7×13.8 mm to 28.7×19.1 mm, but are typically about 22.5×15 mm for Canon and 24×16 mm for other manufacturers. Each variant results in a slightly different angle of view from lenses at the same focal length and overall a much narrower angle of view compared to 35 mm film. This is why each manufacturer offers a range of lenses designed for its format.  Comparison with other formats  The signal-to-noise ratio for a given pixel is largely defined by the number of photons per pixel and the sensor readout noise. Hence, for practical applications, the image noise of an APS-C sensor cannot be directly compared to either smaller or bigger sensor sizes, as its light-collecting property is largely defined by the overall optical system, rather than sensor area. Brand designations Drawing showing the relative sizes of sensors used in most current digital cameras. Most DSLR and third party lens manufacturers now make lenses specifically designed for APS-C cameras.

Actual multiplier factor is 1.255× for the 1D Digital, 1.28× for the Canon EOS-1D Mark III and 1.29× for the Canon EOS-1D Mark IV. Leica M8 is 1.33× APS-C lens formats Canon, Fuji, Nikon, Pentax and Sony have developed and designed lenses specifically for their cameras with a lens factor (more fully, lens focal length conversion factor) or \\"crop factor\\". Whilst Canon uses a factor of 1.6×, the other four brands all use 1.5×. APS-C cameras use a smaller area to form the image than traditional 35 mm cameras, and so lenses used on APS-C format cameras have a correspondingly narrower field of view. For example, a 28 mm lens is a wide angle lens on a traditional 35 mm camera. But the same lens on an APS-C camera, with a lens factor of 1.6× (relative to a standard full-frame 35 mm format camera), has the same angle of view as a 45 mm (28 mm × 1.6 lens factor) lens on a 35 mm camera—i.e. a normal lens. Several third- party lens manufacturers, such as Tamron, Tokina, and Sigma, also manufacture a range of lenses optimised for APS-C sensors. =Canon= Canon EF-S lens is compatible to Canon's APS-C digital SLRs Canon introduced the Canon EF-S line of lenses in 2003 alongside the 300D. These lenses place the rear of the lens closer to the camera's sensor (referred to as short back focus). This has several benefits, including lighter lenses and a narrower field of view (which implies \\"longer\\" zoom). EF-S lenses are compatible with Canon's APS-C digital SLRs, with the exception of the early Canon EOS D30, Canon EOS D60, and Canon EOS 10D, which predated the introduction of the mounting system. EF-S lenses will not physically mount on Canon's full-frame digital or 35mm film SLRs. More recently, the company introduced the EF-M line for its EOS M series of mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs). EF-M lenses will not physically mount on any Canon SLR, whether film or digital. The rear of an EF-M lens is considerably closer to the sensor or film plane than that of an EF (full-frame/35mm) or EF-S lens, making it necessary to ensure that the EF-M lens will not mount on the other bodies. Canon sells an optional adapter that allows EF-M bodies to accept all EF and EF-S lenses. =Nikon= Nikon makes DX format lenses for their line of APS-C digital cameras. These can be physically mounted to all Nikon digital and film SLR camera bodies since 1977. These lenses generally exhibit vignetting at shorter focal lengths when mounted on Nikon film bodies, but are typically usable at longer focal lengths. When mounted on a Nikon FX (full-frame) digital body, by default the camera will automatically adjust the viewfinder to depict the DX frame area and crop the captured images to the DX image size. This can be overridden by the user if desired. =Pentax= Pentax produces the DA line for their APS-C cameras. These lenses are available in focal lengths that offer similar field- of-view as lenses previously available for 135 film. The trademark compact design of the DA limited series takes advantage of the smaller APS-C format with the lenses under 40 mm and is fully usable on 135 Film with the DA Limited Lenses over 35 mm focal length. All DA lenses can be mounted on Pentax film bodies, albeit with increased vignetting. All fixed focal lengths in the rugged DA* series cover 35 film format fully. =Sony= Sony has two lines specifically designed for their APS-C cameras—the DT line for their A-mount DSLRs and α SLTs, and the E-mount for their α MILCs. The DT lenses can be mounted on any Sony A-mount camera, but are specifically designed for the DSLR-A100 up to DSLR-A700 series of APS-C-format DSLRs, the earlier Konica Minolta 5D and 7D, and the most recent APS-C Alpha SLTs. DT lenses can be mounted on full-frame models like the DSLR-A850, DSLR-A900, and SLT-A99 in \\"crop\\" mode, where the frame is cropped and the resolution is roughly halved. E-mount lenses are compatible with all of the company's APS-C MILCs, from the NEX-3 and NEX-5 through the current α3000, α5100, and α6500. In addition, they can be mounted on Sony full-frame MILCs (α7/α7R/α7S, α7R II, α7S II) in \\"crop\\" mode (the company also produces E-mount lenses designated as \\"FE\\", which cover the entire full-frame image circle).

The series had distribution problems throughout its run. Several distributors refused to take the King Comics because their first issues lacked a Comics Code Authority seal; King subsequently obtained a CCA seal on all later King Comics issues.

O. Brown Stadium. C.O. Brown Stadium is a baseball stadium in the United States located in Battle Creek, Michigan. The stadium was built in 1990 and is a part of Bailey Park, a longtime home of amateur baseball. C.O. Brown Stadium is the former home of the Michigan Battle Cats, Battle Creek Yankees and the Southwest Michigan Devil Rays of the Class A Midwest League. The stadium has a seating capacity of 2,193. C.O. Brown Stadium is the current home of the Northwoods League's Battle Creek Bombers. Name origin The stadium was named for Cooper Othniel Brown, a baseball entrepreneur who helped make Battle Creek a hub for amateur tournament baseball in the 1930s and served as the first president of the American Amateur Baseball Congress.\\"C.O.

Stadium renovations  In 2016 the team announced major ballpark renovations that will drop the seating capacity of C.O. Brown Stadium from more than 4,000 to 2,300. The marquee renovation includes the introduction of an all-new “Home Plate Club,” which will feature 10 granite half-moon tables situated directly behind home plate. Each table will also feature four stadium chairs sourced from Camden Yards. Each table will have access to its own all-inclusive upscale menu, including both beer and wine pairings. The team has already had a number of these reserved and is taking deposits for full- and half-season plans immediately. All 10 tables are expected to be sold out well before Opening Day. “The Champions Club,” which was sold out for most of 2015, now shifts down the first and third base lines. These areas will now feature additional legroom and a food and beverage railing in front of each seat. This renovation allows for a more comfortable fan experience and gives the Bombers 98 Champions Club seats for 2016. The bleacher area will also look quite different this summer. The team will offer reserved bleacher seats instead of general admission seating, which will guarantee ticket holders a designated seat at each game. The first-base side will now have permanent vinyl grandstand covers over the seats. These covers will eliminate seating in an area where historically the sun has tormented fans. The Miller Lite Party Deck will also be receiving a facelift, courtesy of Heights Construction. While some general upkeep and maintenance will be performed, the team plans to stain the deck area while repurposing seats from the original C.O. Brown Stadium bowl grandstand. Furthermore, the team has now limited the Miller Lite Party Deck to approximately 375 tickets on any given night and will allow groups to reserve their own private sections. Awards In November 2007, Bailey Park and C.O. Brown Stadium was awarded the 2007 USSSA United States Specialty Sports Association Complex of the Year Award presented at the USSSA National Meeting in Daytona Beach, Florida. Presented annually to one facility in the country, there are a number of requirements that a complex must meet to qualify. Requirements for the award include: full participation with USSSA, a proven history of hosting and running quality events, a high number of participating teams, outstanding facilities, and top notch ground crews.

Tags are usually single words, and the importance of each tag is shown with font size or color.Martin Halvey and Mark T. Keane, An Assessment of Tag Presentation Techniques , poster presentation at WWW 2007, 2007 This format is useful for quickly perceiving the most prominent terms to determine its relative prominence. Bigger term means greater weight. When used as website navigation aids, the terms are hyperlinked to items associated with the tag.  History  Heidi Paris: initial cover draft for the German edition of \\"A Thousand Plateaus\\" by Gilles Deleuze and Fèlix Guattari, dated Nov 14 1991 In the language of visual design, a tag cloud (or word cloud) is one kind of \\"weighted list\\", as commonly used on geographic maps to represent the relative size of cities in terms of relative typeface size. An early printed example of a weighted list of English keywords was the \\"subconscious files\\" in Douglas Coupland's Microserfs (1995). A German appearance occurred in 1992. The specific visual form and common use of the term \\"tag cloud\\" rose to prominence in the first decade of the 21st century as a widespread feature of early Web 2.0 websites and blogs, used primarily to visualize the frequency distribution of keyword metadata that describe website content, and as a navigation aid. The first tag clouds on a high-profile website were on the photo sharing site Flickr, created by Flickr co-founder and interaction designer Stewart Butterfield in 2004. That implementation was based on Jim Flanagan's Search Referral Zeitgeist,A copy of Jim Flanagan's Search Referral Zeitgeist was available at archive.org but has since been blocked. In the comments of a blog entry , a user identified as Steve Minutillo attribute the idea to Jim Flanagan, stating that Flanagan's site had such displays in 2002. a visualization of Web site referrers. Tag clouds were also popularized around the same time by Del.icio.us and Technorati, among others. Oversaturation of the tag cloud method and ambivalence about its utility as a web-navigation tool led to a noted decline of usage among these early adopters. (Flickr would later \\"apologize\\" to the web-development community in their five-word acceptance speech for the 2006 \\"Best Practices\\" Webby Award, where they simply stated \\"sorry about the tag clouds.\\") A second generation of software development discovered a wider diversity of uses for tag clouds as a basic visualization method for text data. Several extensions of tag clouds have been proposed in this context.  Types  R with the wordcloud package. Data from Country population. Note that the proportional sizes of China and India were divided in half. There are three main types of tag cloud applications in social software, distinguished by their meaning rather than appearance. In the first type, there is a tag for the frequency of each item, whereas in the second type, there are global tag clouds where the frequencies are aggregated over all items and users. In the third type, the cloud contains categories, with size indicating number of subcategories. = Frequency = In the first type, size represents the number of times that tag has been applied to a single item.Bielenberg, K. and Zacher, M., Groups in Social Software: Utilizing Tagging to Integrate Individual Contexts for Social Navigation , Masters Thesis submitted to the Program of Digital Media, Universität Bremen (2006) This is useful as a means of displaying metadata about an item that has been democratically \\"voted\\" on and where precise results are not desired. In the second, more commonly used type, size represents the number of items to which a tag has been applied, as a presentation of each tag's popularity. = Significance = Instead of frequency, the size can be used to represent the significance of words and word co-occurrences, compared to a background corpus (for example, compared to all the text in Wikipedia). This approach cannot be used standalone, but it relies on comparing the document frequencies to expected distributions. = Categorization = In the third type, tags are used as a categorization method for content items. Tags are represented in a cloud where larger tags represent the quantity of content items in that category. There are some approaches to construct tag clusters instead of tag clouds, e.g., by applying tag co-occurrences in documents.Knautz, K., Soubusta, S., & Stock, W.G. (2010). Tag clusters as information retrieval interfaces . Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS-43), January 5–8, 2010. IEEE Computer Society Press (10 pages). More generally, the same visual technique can be used to display non- tag data, as in a word cloud or a data cloud. The term keyword cloud is sometimes used as a search engine marketing (SEM) term that refers to a group of keywords that are relevant to a specific website. In recent years tag clouds have gained popularity because of their role in search engine optimization of Web pages as well as supporting the user in navigating the content in an information system efficiently. Tag clouds as a navigational tool make the resources of a website more connected,Trattner, C.:Linking Related Content in Web Encyclopedias with search query tag clouds . IADIS International Journal on WWW/Internet, Volume 9, Issue 2, 2011 when crawled by a search engine spider, which may improve the site's search engine rank. From a user interface perspective they are often used to summarize search results to support the user in finding content in a particular information system more quickly.Tratter, C., Lin, Y., Parra, D., Yue, Z., Brusilovsky, P.: Evaluating Tag-Based Information Access in Image Collections . In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media (HT 2012). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 2012  Visual appearance  A data cloud showing stock price movement. Color indicates positive or negative change, font size indicates percentage change. Tag clouds are typically represented using inline HTML elements. The tags can appear in alphabetical order, in a random order, they can be sorted by weight, and so on. Sometimes, further visual properties are manipulated in addition to font size, such as the font color, intensity, or weight.Lohmann, S., Ziegler, J., Tetzlaff, L. Comparison of Tag Cloud Layouts: Task-Related Performance and Visual Exploration , T. Gross et al. (Eds.): INTERACT 2009, Part I, LNCS 5726, pp. 392–404, 2009. Most popular is a rectangular tag arrangement with alphabetical sorting in a sequential line-by-line layout. The decision for an optimal layout should be driven by the expected user goals. Some prefer to cluster the tags semantically so that similar tags will appear near each otherHassan-Montero, Y., Herrero-Solana, V. Improving Tag-Clouds as Visual Information Retrieval Interfaces .

Edges can be added to emphasize the co-occurrences of tags and visualize interactions. Heuristics can be used to reduce the size of the tag cloud whether or not the purpose is to cluster the tags. Tag cloud visual taxonomy is determined by a number of attributes: tag ordering rule (e.g. alphabetically, by importance, by context, randomly, ordered for visual quality), shape of the entire cloud (e.g. rectangular, circle, given map borders), shape of tag bounds (rectangle, or character body), tag rotation (none, free, limited), vertical tag alignment (sticking to typographical baselines, free). A tag cloud on the web must address problems of modeling and controlling aesthetics, constructing a two-dimensional layout of tags, and all these must be done in short time on volatile browser platform. Tags clouds to be used on the web must be in HTML, not graphics, to make them robot-readable, they must be constructed on the client side using the fonts available in the browser, and they must fit in a rectangular box.Marszałkowski, J., Mokwa, D., Drozdowski, M., Rusiecki, L., Narożny, H. Fast algorithms for online construction of web tag clouds, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 64, pp. 378–390, 2017.  Data clouds  A data cloud or cloud data is a data display which uses font size and/or color to indicate numerical values. It is similar to a tag cloud but instead of word count, displays data such as population or stock market prices.  Text clouds  Text cloud comparing 2002 State of the Union Address by U.S. President Bush and 2011 State of the Union Address by President Obama. Malayalam Text Cloud with Science related words A text cloud or word cloud is a visualization of word frequency in a given text as a weighted list. The technique has recently been popularly used to visualize the topical content of political speeches.  Collocate clouds  Extending the principles of a text cloud, a collocate cloud provides a more focused view of a document or corpus. Instead of summarising an entire document, the collocate cloud examines the usage of a particular word. The resulting cloud contains the words which are often used in conjunction with the search word. These collocates are formatted to show frequency (as size) as well as collocational strength (as brightness). This provides interactive ways to browse and explore language.  Perception  Tag clouds have been subject of investigation in several usability studies. The following summary is based on an overview of research results given by Lohmann et al.: * Tag size: Large tags attract more user attention than small tags (effect influenced by further properties, e.g., number of characters, position, neighboring tags). * Scanning: Users scan rather than read tag clouds. * Centering: Tags in the middle of the cloud attract more user attention than tags near the borders (effect influenced by layout). * Position: The upper left quadrant receives more user attention than the others (Western reading habits). * Exploration: Tag clouds provide suboptimal support when searching for specific tags (if these do not have a very large font size). Felix et al. compared how human reading performance differs from traditional tag clouds that map numeric values to the size of the font and alternative designs that uses for example color or additional shapes like circle and bars. They also compared how different arrangement of the words affects performance. * Use an additional bar or circle instead of the font size increases accuracy when reading the numeric value * However users can find specific word quicker when no additional mark is used * The performance depends on the task, simple tasks like finding a word are highly affected by the design choice, however the effect on tasks like identify the topic of a tag cloud is much smaller.  Creation  Wordle constructed from Wikipedia's top 1000 vital articles sorted by number of views. Available at Wordle gallery. In principle, the font size of a tag in a tag cloud is determined by its incidence. For a word cloud of categories like weblogs, frequency, for example, corresponds to the number of weblog entries that are assigned to a category. For smaller frequencies one can specify font sizes directly, from one to whatever the maximum font size. For larger values, a scaling should be made. In a linear normalization, the weight t_i of a descriptor is mapped to a size scale of 1 through f, where t_{\\\\min} and t_{\\\\max} are specifying the range of available weights. :s_i = \\\\left \\\\lceil \\\\frac{f_{\\\\max}\\\\cdot(t_i - t_{\\\\min})}{t_{\\\\max}-t_{\\\\min}} \\\\right \\\\rceil for t_i > t_{\\\\min}; else s_{i}=1 :* s_i: display fontsize :* f_{\\\\max}: max. fontsize :* t_i: count :* t_{\\\\min}: min. count :* t_{\\\\max}: max. count Since the number of indexed items per descriptor is usually distributed according to a power law, for larger ranges of values, a logarithmic representation makes sense. Implementations of tag clouds also include text parsing and filtering out unhelpful tags such as common words, numbers, and punctuation. There are also websites creating artificially or randomly weighted tag clouds, for advertising, or for humorous results.

As a nationalist leader and Prime Minister, he helped to restore civilian government to the country following military rule. Early life Busia was born a prince in the kingdom of Wenchi, in the Brong Ahafo Region, one of the four Gold Coast Territories, then under British rule and now called Ghana. Education He was educated at Methodist School, Wenchi, Mfantsipim School, Cape Coast, then at Wesley College, Kumasi, from 1931 to 1932. He taught at Wesley College and left to study and teach at Achimota College. He gained his first degree with Honours in Medieval and Modern History from the University of London, through correspondence during this period. He then went on to study at University College, Oxford, where he was the college's first African student. He returned to the Gold Coast in 1942. He took a BA (Hons) in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (1941, MA 1946) and a DPhil in Social Anthropology in 1947 at Nuffield College, Oxford, with a thesis entitled \\"The position of the chief in the modern political system of Ashanti: a study of the influence of contemporary social changes on Ashanti political institutions.\\" Career He served as a district commissioner from 1942 to 1949, and was appointed first lecturer in African Studies. He became the first African to occupy a Chair at the University College of the Gold Coast (now the University of Ghana). In 1951 he was elected by the Ashanti Confederacy to the Legislative Council. In 1952, he was Leader of Ghana Congress Party, which later merged with the other opposition parties to form the United Party (UP). As leader of the opposition against Kwame Nkrumah, he fled the country on the grounds that his life was under threat. In 1959 Busia became a Professor of Sociology and Culture of Africa at the University of Leiden near the Hague, Netherlands. From 1962 until 1969, he was a Fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford. He returned to Ghana in March 1966 after Nkrumah's government was overthrown by the military to serve on the National Liberation Council of General Joseph Ankrah, the military head of state; and was appointed as the Chairman of the National Advisory Committee of the NLC. In 1967/68, he served as the Chairman of the Centre for Civic Education. He used this opportunity to promote himself as the next Leader. He also was a Member of the Constitutional Review Committee. When the NLC lifted the ban on politics, Busia, together with friends in the defunct UP formed the Progress Party (PP). In 1969, the PP won the parliamentary elections with 104 of the 105 seats contested. This paved the way for him to become the next Prime Minister. Busia continued with NLC's anti-Nkrumaist stance and adopted a liberalised economic system. There was a mass deportation of half a million Nigerian citizens from Ghana, and a 44 percent devaluation of the cedi in 1971, which met with a lot of resistance from the public. While he was in Britain for a medical check-up, the army under Colonel Ignatius Kutu Acheampong overthrew his government on 13 January 1972. Busia remained in exile in England and returned to Oxford University, where he died from a heart attack in August 1978. Along with J. B. Danquah and S. D. Dombo, Busia's name is associated with Ghana's political right. The New Patriotic Party has claimed the Danquah-Busia-Dombo mantle in the Fourth Republic. He left behind four sons and four daughters: Kwasi Osei, Afua Safoa, Nana Gyasi, Yaw, author Abena, yoga guru Kofi, Nana Frema, and actress Akosua Busia.

Due to its complexity, it is often very hard to read by people who are not familiar with it. Usually, this form of graffiti incorporates interwoven and overlapping letters and shapes. It may include arrows, spikes, and other decorative elements depending on the technique used. The numerous layers and shapes make this style extremely difficult to produce homogeneously, which is why developing an original style in this field is seen as one of the greatest artistic challenges to a graffiti writer. Wildstyle pieces are the most complex form of piece (\\"masterpiece\\") lettering, a stage higher than the quick simplified stylised letters known as \\"burners\\". Wildstyle is seen as one of the most complicated and difficult masterpiece styles and refers to larger complex letters which have volume as opposed to mere signatures or graffiti art \\"tags\\". right right Styles  Wildstyle commonly includes a set of arrows, curves and letters which have been so transformed as to be rendered arcane to the eyes of non-graffiti artists. It has also been common practice to incorporate 3D elements into the pieces. Letter structures are therefore rendered to add depth of visual perception of the work. Many artists have different elements to add to their wildstyle that gain that writer a good deal of respect within the graffiti scene, especially if one creates his or her own style and stays original and creative. Veteran artists tend to go for more complicated forms of wildstyle in which the types are hard to read but broad in creativity. Getting one's style mastered is key to achieving this success. History of the term \\"Wildstyle\\" The term \\"wildstyle\\" was popularized by the Wild Style graffiti crew formed by Tracy 168 of the Bronx. Formerly a street gang with over 500 members, the Bronx-based Wild Style crew is still active. Members include the founder Tracy 168, Cope2, T-Kid 170, Lava I&II;, Taki 183, Daze, Comet, Blade, Futura 200, Dan Plasma, Jimmy Ha-Ha and Yip. Complex and elaborate graffiti writing had been called numerous terms such as \\"mechanical letters.\\" It was founded by Rif, Phase II and Stan 153. Kase II later introduced \\"computer- rock\\". The stylistic approach advanced at the same time Wild Style crew grew large and spread throughout New York City.http://www.at149st.com/ws.html at149thst.com entry on Wild Style So many members executed the complex style that eventually the crew's name was associated with it.

It is about the World War II Allied prison camp raid at Cabanatuan in the Philippines.  Synopsis  In late January 1945, 121 Ranger volunteers set out to attempt a rescue of over 513 Allied prisoners of war in a Japanese camp near the Philippine city of Cabanatuan. The prisoners, survivors of the Bataan Death March, had lived in deplorable conditions for three years, suffering from starvation, tropical diseases, and abuse from Japanese soldiers. Ghost Soldiers recounts the story of the prisoners, the Ranger unit performing the raid, and the Filipino guerrillas who provided assistance. A massacre of American soldiers at Palawan alerted U.S. commanders to the danger of mass POW murder as the Japanese retreated from the Philippines. As a consequence, they planned and executed a mission to rescue the POWs from Cabanatuan prison camp.

The full costume includes a patterned wrapped skirt (saburet), a red and yellow headscarf (musue), arm and leg beads (wini), a gold nose ring (olasu) and earrings in addition to the mola blouse (dulemor).About Molas, from Indigenous Art from Panamá. Retrieved February 19, 2006. In Dulegaya, the Guna's native language, \\"mola\\" means \\"shirt\\" or \\"clothing\\". The mola originated with the tradition of kuna women painting their bodies with geometric designs, using available natural colors; in later years these same designs were woven in cotton, and later still, sewn using cloth bought from the European settlers of Panamá.Molas , from Oswaldo DeLeón Kantule. Retrieved February 19, 2006. Development of the style Guma woman displays a selection of molas for sale at her home in the San Blas Islands. Molas have their origin in body painting. Only after colonization by the Spanish and contact with missionaries did the Guna start to transfer their traditional geometric designs on fabric, first by painting directly on the fabric and later by using the technique of reverse appliqué. It is not known for certain when this technique was first used. It seems to have originated in the second half of the nineteenth century. As an inspiration for their designs, the Guna first used the geometrical patterns which have been used for body painting before. In the past 50 years, they have also depicted realistic and abstract designs of flowers, sea animals and birds, and popular culture. Depending on the tradition of each island, Guna women begin the crafting of molas either after they reach puberty, or at a much younger age. Women who prefer to dress in western style are in the minority as well as in the communities in Panama City. Molas have such an importance for the Guna people and their traditional identity that they can be considered responsible for the independent status of the Comarca Guna Yala. After the attempt of the Panamanian government to \\"westernize\\" the Guna in the beginning of the 20th century by prohibiting their customs, their language and their traditional dress, a huge wave of resistance arose. This resistance movement culminated in the Guna revolution of 1925 where, after heavy battles, the Panamanian government gave the Guna people the right to govern their own territory autonomously. Construction Molas are hand-made using a reverse appliqué technique. Several layers (usually two to seven) of different-colored cloth (usually cotton) are sewn together; the design is then formed by cutting away parts of each layer. The edges of the layers are then turned under and sewn down. Often, the stitches are nearly invisible. This is achieved by using a thread the same color as the layer being sewn, sewing blind stitches, and sewing tiny stitches. The finest molas have extremely fine stitching, made using tiny needles. This closeup of a mola by Venancio Restrepo shows the layering of the different colors of cloth, and the fine stitching involved. The largest pattern is typically cut from the top layer, and progressively smaller patterns from each subsequent layer, thus revealing the colors beneath in successive layers. This basic scheme can be varied by cutting through multiple layers at once, hence varying the sequence of colours; some molas also incorporate patches of contrasting colours, included in the design at certain points to introduce additional variations of color.How Molas are Made, from Sherry Thorup. Retrieved February 19, 2006. Molas vary greatly in quality, and the pricing to buyers varies accordingly. A greater number of layers is generally a sign of higher quality; two-layer molas are common, but examples with four or more layers will demand a better price. The quality of stitching is also a factor, with the stitching on the best molas being close to invisible. Although some molas rely on embroidery to some degree to enhance the design, those which are made using only the pure reverse-appliqué technique (or nearly so) are considered better. Molas will often be found for sale with signs of use, such as stitch marks around the edges; such imperfections indicate that the mola was made for use, and not simply for sale to tourists. A mola can take from two weeks to six months to make, depending on the complexity of the design. Molas in Guna Culture This traditional mola represents the olasu, a nose ring worn by the Guna women. The traditional costume of a Guna woman consists of a patterned blue cotton wrapped skirt, red and yellow headscarf, arm and leg beads, gold nose rings and earrings and the many layered and finely sewn mola panel blouse. The artistry of a mola reflects a synthesis of traditional Guna culture with the influences of the modern world. Mola art developed when Guna women had access to store bought yard goods. Mola designs are often inspired by modern graphics such as political posters, labels, pictures from books and TV cartoons, as well as traditional themes from Guna legends and culture. Geometric molas are the most traditional, having developed from ancient body painting designs. Many hours of careful sewing are required to create a fine mola. The ability to make an outstanding mola is a source of status among Guna women. The quality of a mola is determined by such factors as * the number of layers * fineness of the stitching * evenness and width of cutouts * addition of details such as zigzag borders, lattice-work or embroidery * general artistic merit of the design and color combination. When Guna women tire of a particular blouse, they disassemble it and sell the molas to collectors. Since mola panels have been worn as part of the traditional dress of a Guna woman they often show signs of wear such as fading and stitch marks along the edges of the panels. These \\"imperfections\\" indicate that the mola is authentic and not made solely to be sold to tourists. Molas are often sold in pairs, the pair consisting of the back and front panels of a blouse. The two molas are usually two variations on a theme. Matched molas complement each other and should be displayed or used together for the greatest impact. Mola panels have many uses. They can be framed as art or made into pillows, place mats or wall hangings. Some people even make them into bedspreads or incorporate them into quilting projects. Molas are very sturdy and well sewn. Authentic molas have already been washed many times and can be safely hand washed in warm water. Molas may be purchased in Panama or in Colombia. The mola blouse is an important symbol of Guna culture. ReferencesFurther reading *Günther Hartmann, Molakana: Volkskunst der Cuna, Panama, Museum für Voelkerkunde, Berlin, 1980 . *Kit S.

It is featured in Alfred Wainwright’s Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells and is given a height of 1,410 ft approximately; however, the Ordnance Survey and other guidebooks now give an altitude of 423 m (1,388 ft). The fell’s name means ‘The hill of the buck or goat’. It is derived either from the Old English word bucc meaning buck or the Old Norse word bokki meaning a male goat. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south-east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long, wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Buckbarrow is an outlier of the southern branch of the horseshoe. Buckbarrow is not really a separate hill, but just the craggy end of the southern ridge of the neighbouring fell of Seatallan, which reaches a height of 692 m (2,270 ft). Seatallan itself lies to the south of the main ridge, connecting to Haycock across the Pots of Ashness depression. Seatallan's south-western ridge falls gently at first across the broad green expanse of Nether Wasdale Common, finally narrowing to a point at Cat Bields (500 m or 1,640 ft), a mile from the summit. From here the slope continues in the same direction to the Greendale- Gosforth road, its progress only briefly interrupted by the few desultory rocks of Gray Crag. A smaller spur runs out south from Cat Bields, only resolving into a definite ridge some way down the slope at Glade How (435 m or 1,425 ft). This cairned top is recognised as a summit by some guidebooks.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): A little to the south of Glade How the spur ends in a wall of crag, dropping 900 ft to the road below. This is Buckbarrow. Buckbarrow's crags face the Wastwater Screes across the foot of the lake, aping their more famous neighbours in miniature. About three quarters of a mile in length, the principal features of Buckbarrow's southern face are Long Crag, Pike Crag, Bull Crag and Broad Crag. The western boundary is formed by Gill Beck, flowing between Buckbarrow and the main ridge of Seatallan. To the east the crags overlook Greendale Gill, the boundary with Middle Fell. Geology The northern parts of Buckbarrow, blending into the slopes of Seatallan, are overlain by drift deposits, much peat being in evidence around Glade How. The summit area shows outcropping of the Birker Fell Formation, an undivided sequence of generally plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas with subordinate sills. At the bottom of the slope are examples of granophyric microgranite, representative of the Ennerdale Intrusion. Dykes of basalt and dolerite run through both formations.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps: England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) Summit The nearest to an actual summit given the limited prominence is a rocky mound set back from the rim of crags. Much finer views can be obtained from the lower rocky knoll which stands above Pike Crag. Buckbarrow gives good views of Wast Water as well as the Wast Water Screes. The full length of the lake can be seen from Pike Crag, along with a fine view of Great Gable and the Scafells. Ascents The fell is usually climbed from the minor road which runs along the base of the hill. From here Buckbarrow looks quite formidable and the crags are a deterrent to a direct ascent; however, all danger can be bypassed by starting the climb at the more westerly point of Harrow Head farm and following Gill Beck up to a height of around 350 m (1,150 ft) before bearing north easterly to the highest point above the crags. An alternative is to climb from Greendale, via Greendale Gill and Tongues Gills. Buckbarrow can also be bagged almost as an afterthought as the walker descends from Seatallan. Buckbarrow's formidable crags are a popular rock climbing venue.  References  The view of Wast Water from the summit of Buckbarrow.

The film was directed by Edmund Goulding. The film is based on the 1946 novel of the same name, written by William Lindsay Gresham. Power, wishing to expand beyond the romantic and swashbuckler roles that brought him to fame, requested 20th Century Fox's studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck to buy the rights to the novel so he could star as the unsavory lead,Muller, Eddie (May 5, 2019) Intro to the Turner Classic Movie presentation of the film \\"The Great Stanton\\", a scheming carnival barker. The film premiered in the United States on October 9, 1947, then went into wide release on October 28, 1947, later having six more European releases between November 1947 to May 1954. As noted on the DVD commentary track by Alain Silver and James Ursini, Nightmare Alley was somewhat unusual among film noir in having top stars, production staff and a relatively large budget. Despite a strong promotional campaign, the film was not a financial success upon its original release, due in part to protests against some of the scandalous content. The film has since found acclaim and is regarded as a classic. Plot The movie follows the rise and fall of a con man—a story that begins and ends at a seedy traveling carnival. The carnival's barker, Stanton \\"Stan\\" Carlisle (Tyrone Power), is fascinated by everything there, including a grotesque geek, who prompts an observation from Stanton that he \\"can't understand how anybody could get so low.\\" Stanton works with \\"Mademoiselle Zeena\\" (Joan Blondell) and her alcoholic husband, Pete (Ian Keith). Once a top-billed vaudeville act, Zeena and Pete used an ingenious code to make it appear that she had extraordinary mental powers, until her attentions to other men drove Pete to drink and reduced them to working in carnivals. Stanton learns that many people want to buy the code from Zeena for a lot of money but she refuses to sell; she is saving it as a nest egg. Stanton tries to romance Zeena into teaching it to him but she remains faithful to Pete, feeling guilty over the role she played in his downfall and effectively nursemaiding him in the hope of some day sending him to a detox clinic for alcoholics. But one night in Texas, Stanton accidentally gives Pete the wrong bottle: the old man dies from drinking wood alcohol instead of moonshine. To keep her act going, Zeena is forced to teach Stanton the mind- reading code so that he can serve as her assistant. Stanton prefers the company of the younger Molly (Coleen Gray). When their romance is found out, the remainder of the carnies including strongman Bruno (Mike Mazurki) force the pair into a shotgun marriage. No longer welcome in the carnival, Stanton realizes this is actually a golden opportunity for him. He and his wife leave the carnival. He becomes \\"The Great Stanton\\", performing to enraptured audiences in expensive nightclubs in Chicago. As well as things seem to be going, however, Stanton remains emotionally troubled by Pete's death and by his own part in it. He eventually seeks counseling from psychologist Lilith Ritter (Helen Walker), to whom he confesses all that has occurred. Since Lilith makes a point of recording all of her sessions with her patients, she has a compilation of sensitive information about the lives of various members of Chicago's social elite. Recognizing themselves as kindred spirits to a degree, Lilith and Stanton conspire together to manipulate her patients, with Lilith secretly providing private information about them and Stanton using that information to convince them that he can communicate with the dead. The plan almost works, until Stanton tries to swindle skeptical Ezra Grindle (Taylor Holmes) by having Molly pose as the ghost of Grindle's long-lost love. When the heartbroken Grindle breaks down, Molly refuses to play out the charade and reveals her true self to Grindle, thereby exposing Stanton as a fake. As he prepares to flee, Stanton discovers he has been scammed by Ritter, who gives him only $150 of Grindle's money rather than the promised $150,000 they had conned him out of to that point. With her recordings of Stanton's confessions to her available for use against him, Lilith threatens to testify that he is mentally disturbed should he accuse her of complicity in his crimes. Defeated, Stanton gives the $150 to Molly and urges her return to the carnival world where people care for her. Meanwhile, he gradually sinks into alcoholism. With nowhere else to go, the fallen Stanton tries to get a job at another carnival, only to suffer the ultimate degradation: the only job he can get is playing the geek, eating live chickens in a sideshow and replying to the offer with his recurring catchphrase, \\"Mister, I was made for it.\\" Unable to stand his life any further, he goes berserk. Fortunately, Molly happens to work in the same carnival. Stan regains hope when he sees her again and Molly vows to nurse him back to health, but their reunion is bittersweet, recalling Zeena's nursing the ever-drunk Pete. Cast * Tyrone Power as Stanton \\"Stan\\" Carlisle * Joan Blondell as Zeena Krumbein * Coleen Gray as Molly Carlisle * Helen Walker as Lilith Ritter * Taylor Holmes as Ezra Grindle * Mike Mazurki as Bruno * Ian Keith as Pete Krumbein Production Tyrone Power, wishing to expand beyond the romantic and swashbuckler roles that brought him to fame, requested 20th Century Fox's studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck to buy the rights to the novel so he could star in it. Fox paid $50,000 in September 1946 for the rights to Gresham's novel, and Gresham was hired as consultant to help screenwriter Jules Furthman, although the extent of his contribution to the script is not clear. In November 1946, it was reported that Mark Stevens and Anne Baxter were to star in the film, and that William Keighley would be the director. By January 1947, Lloyd Bacon was the reported director. To make the film more believable, the producers built a full working carnival on ten acres (40,000 m2) of the 20th Century Fox back lot. They also hired over 100 sideshow attractions and carnival people to add further authenticity. Filming also took place at the San Diego County Fair in Del Mar, California. The slightly upbeat but somewhat dark and ambiguous ending of the film was added by screenwriter Furthman at Zanuck's direction, softening the harsh ending of Gresham's novel for commercial purposes.Muller, Eddie (May 5, 2019) Outro to the Turner Classic Movie presentation of the film The novel's ending implies that Stanton is doomed to work as a geek until he drinks himself to death. Author William Lindsay Gresham committed suicide by sleeping pills on September 14, 1962 in the same room in the Hotel Carter where he wrote the first draft of Nightmare Alley. Reception On the film's original release, reviews were mixed, and the film was a box-office flop. The New York Times review commented, > If one can take any moral value out of Nightmare Alley it would seem to be > that a terrible retribution is the inevitable consequence for he who would > mockingly attempt to play God. Otherwise, the experience would not be very > rewarding for, despite some fine and intense acting by Mr. Power and others, > this film traverses distasteful dramatic ground and only rarely does it > achieve any substance as entertainment. The Variety review complimented the film's acting, noting that: > Nightmare Alley is a harsh, brutal story [based on the novel by William > Lindsay Gresham] told with the sharp clarity of an etching ... Most vivid of > these is Joan Blondell as the girl he works for the secrets of the mind- > reading act. Coleen Gray is sympathetic and convincing as his steadfast wife > and partner in his act and Helen Walker comes through successfully as the > calculating femme who topples Power from the heights of fortune back to > degradation as the geek in the carney. Ian Keith is outstanding as > Blondell's drunken husband. In Time magazine (November 24, 1947), film critic James Agee wrote: > \\"Nightmare Alley\\" would be unbearably brutal for general audiences if it > were played for all the humour, cynicism and malign social observation that > are implicit in it.

In a 2000 review of the film in The Village Voice, writer J. Hoberman commented, \\"This 1947 account of an archetypal American's rise and fall is neither a great movie nor even a classic noir but it has a great ambition to be daring and, once seen, is not easily forgotten. The movie suggested far more than it showed but what it showed, including the climactic degradation of 20th Century Fox's then-major star Tyrone Power, was remarkably sordid for so high-profile a release.\\" The film is now regarded as \\"one of the gems of film noir\\" and as one of Power's finest performances. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 11 reviews and gave the film a 100% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.8/10. Remake On December 12, 2017, Fox Searchlight Pictures announced that Guillermo del Toro will direct a new adaptation of the novel, co-writing the screenplay with Kim Morgan. In April 2019, Leonardo DiCaprio was negotiating to star in del Toro's film. In August 2019, it was reported that Cate Blanchett was negotiating to co-star with Bradley Cooper in the film, which is scheduled to starting shooting in early 2020. On September 4, 2019, Rooney Mara was cast in the film.

He is considered a saint by the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and is one of the most renowned saints of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Early life Shenoute was born in the middle of the fourth century ADEmmel (2004), p.6 (the date 348 AD, often mentioned but not universally accepted, is based on an inscription in his monastery, dating from the twelfth or thirteen centuryEmmel (2004), p. 12). Around 385 AD, Shenoute became the father of the White Monastery in Upper Egypt.Emmel (2004), p. 7 It has often been assumed that Shenoute was the immediate successor of the White Monastery's founder, Pcol. However, the reconstruction of Shenoute's literary corpus made it possible to realize that Pcol died in the 370s and was then succeeded not by Shenoute but by another father, Ebonh, and that a spiritual crisis during Ebonh's tenure as head of the White Monastery, a crisis which seems to have involved carnal sin, enabled Shenoute to come to prominence and to become Ebonh's immediate successor.Emmel (2004), p. 9–10 and p. 558-564 At the Council of Ephesus Because of his popularity in Upper Egypt and his zeal for Orthodoxy, Shenoute was chosen by Saint Cyril the Great to accompany him in representing the Church of Alexandria at the Ecumenical Council of Ephesus in 431 AD.Emmel (2004), p. 8 There he provided the moral support that Saint Cyril needed to defeat the heresy of Nestorius, Bishop of Constantinople. The eventual exile of the latter to Akhmim, Shenoute's backyard, was a testimony to the impression that Shenoute had made upon the attendees of this council. Death On 7 Epip (14 July) 466 AD, following a short illness possibly brought upon by advanced age, Shenoute died in the presence of his monks. Influence on the monastic movement From his uncle, Saint Pigol, Shenoute inherited a monastery based on the Pachomian system, though more austere and stringent. This made its followers few in number and probably promoted decline rather than growth. Shenoute implemented a more comprehensive system that was less stringent and more suitable to the surroundings and the background of the people. This new system had an unusual component, which was a covenant (diatheke) to be recited and adhered to literally by the new novices. It read as follows: Transgressors of that covenant were expelled from the monastery altogether. This was considered a near death sentence for those peasant monks. Another interesting feature of Shenoute's monastic system was the requirement for the new novices to live outside the monastery for a period of time before they were deemed worthy to be consecrated as monks. This seemed to be at odds with the Nitrian monastic system, which allowed the monks to live away from the monastic settlements only after they became proficient in the monastic life. Shenoute also utilized the time of the monks, outside prayer and worship, in more varied tasks within the monastery than the Nitrian monks were exposed to. Aside from the traditional trades of rope and basket weaving, the monks engaged in weaving and tailoring linen, cultivation of flax, leather work and shoe-making, writing and book-binding, carpentry, and metal and pottering-making. All in all, Shenouda tried as much as possible to employ the monks in their old professions. Such activities made the monastery a vast self-supporting complex, which occupied some of land. As a monastic leader, Shenoute recognized the need for literacy among monks. So he required all his monks and nuns to learn to read and encouraged more of them to pursue the art of writing manuscripts. This made the monastery more and more appealing to belong to and consequently made the threat of expulsion more painful. Legacy as a national leader In his laudatory Life of Saint Shenoute, his disciple Saint Wissa (Besa) recounts several incidents of Shenoute coming to the aid of poor Coptic peasants. One time he went to Akhmim to chastise a pagan because of the oppression he was inflicting on the poor (Vita #81-2). Another time he acted to eliminate the cause of grief of the peasants, that the pagan landlords of Paneleou forced them to buy the latter's spoiled wine (Vita #85-6). On a third occasion he risked his life to successfully ask for the freedom of the captives at Psoi from the hands of the Blemmyes warriors (Vita #89). He also at times appealed on behalf of the peasants to those in power, including the Roman emperor Theodosius I. In summary, Shenoute fully recognized the misery of his people and emerged as their sincere advocate and popular leader. Life as a writer To talk about Shenoute's writing is to discuss Coptic literature at its best. He wrote in a style that was essentially his own, with writings based on a careful study of the scholastic rhetoric of his time, which displayed the wide and deep range of knowledge he possessed. They were adorned with endless quotations from the Holy Scriptures, a typical feature of patristic writings. The scriptures were quoted whenever a presented argument needed support. In doing so Shenoute also displayed an astonishing memory as he rendered these passages with amazing accuracy. Shenoute's knowledge was not confined to the Holy Bible, as was the case for the majority of the monks in Egypt. He was fluent in both Coptic and Greek, and was fairly well acquainted with Greek thought and theology. The sprinkling of Greek loan-words in his writings was both extensive and sophisticated, and it was definitely not a product of his living environment. He also expressed knowledge of the works of Aristotle, Aristophanes, the Platonic school, and even some of the Greek legends. He certainly read some of Saint Athanasius' works like the Life of Saint Anthony and some of his homiletic works. Shenoute also knew the letters of Saint Anthony, some of the letters of Saint Pachomius, and most likely some of the works of Evagrius. His knowledge further extended to such popular non- canonical texts as the Acts of Archelaus and the Gospel of Thomas. The writing of Saint Shenoute can be grouped into four categories: * Moral sermons: This category includes the richest collection that have survived from Shenoute's writings. Among his works here is one about the disobedience to clerics De Disoboedientia ad Clericos, in which he stressed the benefit of obedience and the punishment of the disobedient. He also wrote about the Nativity and the glorification of the Lord, where he discussed free will and the place of chastity in the monastic life De Castitate et Nativitate. * Sermons against the pagans: This category represents an important side of Shenoute's thinking. In one place, he portrayed the pagans as worse than demons whose idols shall rightly be destroyed by the Christians. In another sermon he aimed his attack against a pagan, probably a magistrate, who troubles the monks Adversus Saturnum. In a third sermon he attacks the concept of fate, in the opinion of the idolaters, as the controlling factor in the life of a person. He encounters with the teaching that nothing actually happens without the will of God Contra Idolatras, de Spatio Vitae. * Sermons against the heretics: This category is similar conceptually to the preceding one. Here Shenoute directs his attack against the heretics who corrupted the faith. One encounters in this category one of Shenoute's longest works, which was probably written as a treatise rather than just a sermon. This is the work against the Origenists and the Gnostics Contra Origenistas et Gnosticos. The aim of this work was to oppose heretics in general and Origenists in particular, with regards to their apocryphal books that they used and circulated. He also touched upon the subjects of the plurality of the worlds, the position and the work of the Savior, and the meaning of Easter. Other subjects mentioned in the treatise included the relationship between the Father and the Son, the origin of souls, Christ's Conception, the Eucharist, resurrection of the body, and the four elements. Among the other works within this category were against the Melitians, in regard to the multiple celebration of the Eucharist in one day; against the Manichaeans, concerning the value of the Old Testament alongside the New Testament; and against Nestorius in relations to the preexistence of Christ before His birth from the Virgin. * Sermons based on interviews with magistrates that visited him: This final category represents sermons that were based on miscellaneous interviews that he held with magistrates who visited him as a consequence of his fame and great authority. In those sermons Shenoute touches upon such arguments as the appropriateness of him correcting even generals in spiritual matters, the dimensions of the sky and the earth, the devil and free will, and the punishment of sinners. He also discussed the duties of judges and other such important personages as bishops, wealthy people, and generals. As more and more identifications of Saint Shenoute's literary works are made, his contribution to Coptic literature appears to be even greater than previously assumed. On the one hand, it is becoming clear that he treated a wide range of subjects, not only monastic ones. This suggests a more favorable assessment of the theological character of his writing, his spirituality, and his moral and nationalistic behavior. On the other hand, he accepted the inclusion of literary activity in the religious field. This sets him apart from the Pachomian system that tended to treat religious literature as mere written instructions with no regard to style being given. He further developed a style that is clearly a product of careful study of the scholastic Greek rhetoric of his time. Monasteries named after Saint Shenoute St. Shenouda Monastery, New South Wales, Australia Four Coptic Orthodox monasteries worldwide are named after Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite, namely: * Monastery of Saint Shenouda near Sohag, Egypt, also known as the White Monastery * Monastery of Saint Shenouda in Milano, Italy * Coptic Monastery of St. Shenouda in Rochester, New York, U.S. * St. Shenouda Coptic Orthodox Monastery in Putty, New South Wales, Australia There is also a Coptic Orthodox church – St. Mary and St. Shenouda – in Coulsdon, England.

It runs across the state in a roughly northwest-to- southeast trajectory, stretching from the Vermont border in the west to the Maine border in the east. NH 26 is a multi-state route with both states. At its western end, NH 26 connects to Vermont Route 102 in Lemington via the extremely short, yet fully designated Vermont Route 26 (VT 26). At in length, it is by far the shortest state route in Vermont. At its eastern end, NH 26 meets Maine State Route 26 which connects with the city of Portland in the south. The number 26 dates from 1922, when the multi-state route was first designated New England Interstate Route 26 as part of the New England road marking system of the 1920s. Route description 195x195px NH 26 is a mostly isolated highway which runs through mountainous terrain. The highway begins in the west at the state line between Lemington, Vermont and Colebrook, New Hampshire along the Connecticut River. It is connected to Vermont Route 102 via the short stub highway VT 26. The highway runs east into downtown Colebrook where it intersects with U.S. Route 3. NH 26 briefly overlaps with US 3 before splitting off east again towards Dixville (the southern end of the overlap is the historic northern terminus of New England Interstate Route 26). From Colebrook to Dixville, NH 26 runs tightly along the Mohawk River, a tributary of the Connecticut. NH 26 runs through Dixville Notch, a mountain pass of the northernmost White Mountains at an altitude of approximately , which has its own state park. The site of the Balsams Grand Resort Hotel, which opened during the Civil War but was closed in 2011, is also located along NH 26. After leaving Dixville (which the \\"Notch\\" is a part of) NH 26 nicks the northeastern corner of the township of Millsfield before entering the town of Errol, where it meets its only other major intersection at NH 16. The two routes are briefly cosigned in the downtown area before NH 16 splits off to the northeast. NH 26, heading southeast, crosses the Androscoggin River and then runs along the southwestern side of Umbagog Lake. It passes through the northeastern corner of the township of Cambridge before crossing into Upton, Maine and continuing as Maine State Route 26 south (SR 26 is a north- south highway). =Vermont Route 26= Vermont Route 26 is the short connection between Vermont Route 102 and the New Hampshire state line. It is only long, but is signed and recognized by VTrans as a state route. It is by far the shortest state route in Vermont. The next shortest, Vermont Route 119 (another of many short connectors of multi-state routes in Vermont), is about six times longer at . The entire length of Vermont Route 26 as viewed from the western end. The eastern terminus of the route is a town line marker 1/3 of the way across the bridge. History The entirety of modern NH 26, VT 26 and Maine State Route 26 were initially designated New England Interstate Route 26 (NEI 26) as part of the New England road marking system introduced in 1922, following nearly the same exact route as today. NEI 26 was known as the Dixville Notch Way and originally stretched from Portland in the south (where it connected to New England Interstate Route 1 - modern U.S. Route 1) to Colebrook in the north (where it connected to New England Interstate Route 6 - modern U.S. Route 3). At some point, the route was extended to the Vermont state border to connect with what is now Vermont Route 102 in Lemington. In 1925, the United States Numbered Highways supplanted the New England Interstate system and NEI 26 was redesignated as a set of state highways bearing the number 26. The New Hampshire (and by extension, Vermont) section of the roadway has not undergone any significant changes since then. NEI 26 was clearly intended to be a north-south highway, which SR 26 in Maine illustrates. However, NH 26 is signed as an east-west highway, reflecting its orientation within the state. This means that, in driving the old Interstate route from south to north, mileposts on NH 26 will actually be decreasing since mileposts normally increase from west to east.

The bridge is named for famous United States Marine Band conductor and composer John Philip Sousa, who grew up near the bridge's northwestern terminus. The first bridge at this location was constructed in 1804, but burned by United States armed forces in 1814 during the War of 1812. It was replaced in 1815, but the bridge burned to the waterline in 1846. The rapid growth of residential developments east of the Anacostia River led to the construction of a narrow, iron girder bridge in 1890. This bridge led to even swifter economic and residential development of the area. Efforts to replace the 1890 bridge with a modern structure began in 1931, but were not successful until 1938. The downstream (southern) span opened on December 9, 1939, to great fanfare. The upstream span was completed on January 18, 1941. The Sousa Bridge has a partial interchange with the Barney Circle traffic circle at its northwestern end, and a partial interchange with Anacostia Freeway at its southeastern terminus. A major battle over building an Inner Loop Expressway in the District of Columbia occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. This led to the partial construction of Interstate 695 from Interstate 395 to Barney Circle, but political battles over the wisdom of further construction led to cancellation of the remaining highway—leaving Barney Circle and the northern approaches to the Sousa Bridge partially deconstructed. An attempt to build the remainder of Interstate 695 (the \\"Barney Circle Freeway\\") in the 1990s also failed. In 2010, the District of Columbia decommissioned the portion of Interstate 695 leading to Barney Circle and the Sousa Bridge, and began rebuilding the circle and approaches. Early bridges at the site The village of Georgetown in what later became the District of Columbia was founded in 1745. A road ran generally southeast along what is today Pennsylvania Avenue NW to Capitol Hill, and then along a slightly more southerly course than present-day Pennsylvania Avenue SE to stop at the intersection of what was then Virginia Avenue SE, M Street SE, and 14th Street SE on the shores of the Anacostia River (then known as the \\"Eastern Branch\\"). Aquila Wheeler had a ferry there which he used to take people across the river to the Upper Marlboro Turnpike (now Pennsylvania Avenue SE). This ferry was known as the Upper Ferry, distinguishing it from the Lower Ferry (which ran from Barry's Wharf near the intersection of New Jersey Avenue SE and O Street SE across the Anacosita to Poplar Point). Wheeler died in 1796, and his widow, Elizabeth, operated the ferry until she was declared insane in 1799. =The bridge of 1804= In 1795, Daniel Carroll, William Duncanson, Thomas Law, Notley Young, George Walker, and Matthew Wigfield petitioned the Maryland General Assembly for permission to construct a bascule bridge over the Anacostia River. On December 24, 1795, the Maryland legislature adopted a bill authorizing the bridge. The Maryland act required that the bridge be constructed at the base of Kentucky Avenue SE (less than a hundred feet downstream from the terminus of the current bridge). (William Young, Elizabeth Wheeler's brother and a relative of Notley Young's, owned this land.) Its southeastern terminus was to be on land owned by Wigfield. It was authorized by law to collect tolls, although these could be no higher than the market average. A corporation, the Eastern Branch Bridge Co., was formed to build the bridge. It issued 225 shares at $200 a share, with dividends to be paid from tolls collected on the bridge. Under the terms of the legislature's bill, title to the bridge reverted to the state of Maryland after 30 years. The corporation didn't act with much urgency. It was not until March 18, 1801, that stock in the firm was sold, but even then $43,000 was quickly raised. The bridge was completed and opened for traffic in January 1804. The bridge was wide and had a draw span wide. Its abutments were of stone, but its piers were wood. Construction of the bridge allowed Pennsylvania Avenue to be extended across the Anacostia River for the first time. A major flood struck the Anacostia River on July 8, 1804, and piled logs and fence posts against the bridge. It survived. The bridge did not survive the War of 1812. The United States Army suffered an ignominious defeat in the Battle of Bladensburg on August 24, 1814, leaving the city of Washington open to the British Army. The Eastern Branch bridge was one of only three land routes into the city. Early in the afternoon, Captain John Creighton, a United States Navy officer, burned the bridge to the waterline. =The 1815 bridge= The Eastern Branch Bridge Co. sued the U.S. Navy for burning its bridge. To quiet the suit, Congress appropriated $20,000 (another source says $20,500) to pay the bridge's investors. The bridge company used some of this money to rebuild, and a wooden bascule span bridge reopened in the same spot in 1815. Now often called the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge, it operated as a toll bridge from 1815 to 1841. It deteriorated over time, and in 1841 was closed to vehicular traffic (but remained open for foot traffic). In 1846, a steamship attempting to go up the Anacostia became wedged in the draw span. Sparks from the ship's funnel ignited the bridge, and it burned to the water line. For many years thereafter, the pilings of the old bridge could be seen when the water level in the river was low. = The 1890 bridge = The 1890 bridge, photographed about 1938 shortly before it was demolished. No bridge connected the east and west ends of Pennsylvania Avenue SE over the Anacostia River between 1845 and 1890. Benning Bridge, erected upstream in 1805, and the 11th Street Bridges, built downstream in 1820, also carried vehicular and foot traffic over the Ancostia. But the Uniontown \\"suburb\\" was platted in the Anacostia area in 1854, and development slowly began to turn the agricultural land into businesses and residences. The destruction of the Eastern Branch Bridge in 1846, however, significantly slowed growth in the area for five decades. About 1871, a real estate development known as \\"East Washington Heights\\" began.; Citizens in the area wanted a bridge to reconnect \\"their\\" Pennsylvania Avenue (which ran through the center of their neighborhoods) with the Pennsylvania Avenue \\"in the city\\". Building a new bridge over the Anacostia River only slowly became an issue for them, and it was not until 1875 that the EWCA began agitating for one. A new bridge, the EWCA pointed out, would save residents of East Washington in travel every time they visited the city center on the other side of the river. On February 19, 1886, the EWCA formed a committee to lobby the Commissioners of the District of Columbia (the city government) and Congress on the issue. Later that year, Representative Barnes Compton (D-Maryland) introduced legislation in Congress to build a $60,000 bridge of wood on wooden piers. But the Compton bill was strongly opposed by the D.C. Commissioners. The legislation required that the city pay half the cost of the structure, and Commissioner Samuel E. Wheatley led the city government in adamantly refusing to support the bill. A group of EWCA members began personally lobbying Congress for the bridge. Samuel Taylor Suit, a state senator in the Maryland legislature, won passage of a resolution by that state supporting the bridge. These efforts proved highly successful. Senator Blackburn and Representative Rowell won a $40,000 increase in the amount appropriated for the bridge, and inserted language into the bill requiring that it be constructed of iron and be set on stone piers. This legislation passed both chambers of Congress unanimously on February 23, 1887. Construction of the new bridge began in November 1887. Complications arose when the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&PR;), whose tracks ran along the north/eastern shore of the Anacostia River, sued the federal government, arguing that the bridge abutment encroached on its right-of-way; eventually the railroad agreed to move its tracks closer to the riverbank, and the federal government paid for the move. But yet more construction delays occurred. Due to the heavily silted bottom of the river, the Army Corps of Engineers could not find solid ground on which to build the bridge's piers and abutments, requiring construction of a cofferdam and extensive excavation and investigation of the riverbed. A major flood in 1888 damaged some of the work, and caused further delays. The new Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge, as it became known, was complete in June 1890. The EWCA decided, however, to delay the bridge's formal dedication and opening until August 25, which was the anniversary of the 1805 bridge's destruction in the War of 1812. The new bridge's dedication was a major even in the history of Washington, D.C. Some 8,000 to 10,000 people attended the event, which included the United States Marine Band, conducted by John Philip Sousa, providing music throughout the afternoon and evening. The total cost of the bridge was $170,000. Construction of the 1890 bridge led to extensive new development east of the river. As the bridge was being built in 1889, a consortium known as the Bliss-Havemeyer Syndicate purchased of land in the former East Washington Heights development. They built a number of roads in the area, and landscaped the plots along Pennsylvania Avenue SE, Alabama Avenue SE, and Branch Avenue SE with gardens, orchards, pavilions, and shade trees. In 1903, Colonel Arthur E. Randle formed the United States Realty Company, bought out the Bliss-Havemeyer Syndicate properties, and founded the settlement of Randle Highlands. In 1902, Randle won approval from Congress to lay streetcar tracks across the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge. By 1905, he had extended his line down Pennsylvania Avenue SE into the new Randle Highlands. The streetcar line over the bridge spurred extensive new development east of the river. Randle began selling lots in Randle Highlands at a brisk pace in 1903. He made so much money that by 1905 he formed the development of \\"North Randle Highlands\\" (now the neighborhoods of Dupont Park, Penn Branch, and the lower portion of Greenway), which extended to Massachusetts Avenue SE. In October 1906, The Washington Post called Randle's developments \\"among the largest real estate enterprises ever successfully carried through in the District.\\" The John Philip Sousa BridgeCampaign for a new bridge= As early as 1931, the Randle Highlands Citizens Association (the former East Washington Citizens Association changed its name in 1908) began pressing city government to replace the aging, inadequate Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge. The campaign to replace the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge began in earnest in January 1934. The Randle Highlands Citizens Association issued a report to the House Committee on Appropriations asking for a $15,000 grant to study the need for and design of a new bridge. The report noted that roadways with a combined width of approached the bridge, leading to extensive and dangerous traffic congestion. The citizens association asked that a new bridge, with a roadway and sidewalks on both sides be constructed. But their request was not acted on. In late summer 1934, Southeast resident Vernis Absher was told by Representative Thomas L. Blanton (who had opposed the bridge) that Congress did not believe citizens of Southeast D.C. were united behind the bridge. Citizens recommended four different locations for a new span, and Congress did not want to get caught in the middle of a political battle over the structure's location. Absher subsequently contacted 11 different citizens' associations in the area, and on September 5, 1934, they agreed to form the Southeast Council of Citizens Associations to speak with one voice for the area. In January 1935, the City Commissioners submitted a city budget to Congress requesting $15,000 to study a new bridge. The budget won the approval of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration and the Bureau of the Budget. A handful of representatives in the House stripped the item from the city budget. Although the item was restored in the Senate, it was removed again in the conference committee. The bridge suffered partial collapse in the early summer of 1935 when a portion of the wooden timbers supporting the road deck collapsed, requiring replacement. The damage was not extensive, however, and the bridge was still considered to be structurally sound. However, the Corps of Engineers limited the weight of vehicles permitted to cross the structure. But in August 1935 the Southeast Businessmen's Association (a group of east-of-the-river business owners) threatened to petition the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration for a new bridge. If that failed, they warned they would seek a redress of grievances in federal court. A third push for the bridge occurred in 1936. Although the Great Depression in the United States was improving, there was a significant effort being made to balance the federal budget. (This budget-tightening would significantly contribute to the Recession of 1937–38.) City commissioners submitted a budget of $47.9 million to the Bureau of the Budget, but saw $4.3 million cut from it. However, a request for $25,000 for a bridge study was retained.; On January 21, the Southeast Businessmen's Association and several citizen associations in the area sent a letter to the Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations and to the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations asking for appropriation of the study funds. In addition to underscoring the dangerous nature of the traffic problems and the deleterious economic effect the out-of-date bridge created, they pointed out that the 67,337 people living east of the river paid 15.5 percent of all city tax revenues but received just 3 percent of its expenditures. On April 6, the Federation of Citizens Association (an umbrella group representing all citizens associations in the city) endorsed the study request in a hearing before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The fate of the District's budget was placed in jeopardy on May 21, 1936, when Representative Thomas L. Blanton (D-Texas) refused to compromise with Senate conference committee members on a wide range of issues (including the \\"federal payment\\" to the city's budget). The city was faced with the prospect of having no budget, and all its funding directly approved by President Roosevelt as \\"relief\\". With Congress racing to a June 20 adjournment, Roosevelt threw his weight behind the Senate. Although the House initially resisted, the final bill (with only minor changes from the Senate version) passed on June 19 and was signed into law by President Roosevelt on June 23.; It included the hard-won $25,000 appropriation for a Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge study. As Captain Herbert C. Whitehurst of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prepared to conduct the study, the Washington Board of Trade prepared for a positive outcome. On July 2, it voted to create a committee to lobby Congress for the funds to build the new bridge. Twelve days later, the Southeast Business Men's Association formed a committee to lobby the District Commissioners for a $750,000 appropriation to build a new bridge. =Seeking authorization and funding for the bridge= Design approved in 1937 by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts for the Sousa Bridge. Captain Whitehurst's study, as expected, recommended approval of a new bridge in the same location as the existing bridge, and in President Roosevelt's fiscal 1938 budget for the city $325,000 was recommended to begin construction. This would allow surveys and designs to be completed. The total cost of the new span was estimated at $1.25 million. The Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, however, stripped the funding for a new bridge and inserted a $40,000 appropriation for repairs instead, after concluding that rising steel prices meant a new bridge could not be constructed for less than $2 million. The Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee restored the $325,000 appropriation on June 5. The full Senate adopted the subcommittee's recommendation on June 8. But the conference committee stripped the appropriation from the final bill. The new bridge received its name when the Southeast Citizens Association (led by member Orrin J. Davy) asked that the bridge be named for the Sousa (the \\"March King\\"), who died in 1932. Senator Royal S. Copeland (D-New York) introduced a resolution (S. 2651) on June 15, 1937, ordering the bridge to be named after famed composer, conductor, and D.C. native John Philip Sousa. The bill passed the Senate, but was not taken up in the House. Copeland reintroduced the measure (S. 494) on January 10, 1939, and it passed both houses of Congress on February 27. President Roosevelt signed it into law (Public Law No. 5) on March 7, 1939. Meanwhile, Captain Whithurst's preliminary design for the bridge was approved by both the National Capital Planning Commission and the United States Commission of Fine Arts. As the city began crafting is fiscal 1939 budget, Captain Whitehurst adopted a new legislative strategy. He submitted to the City Commissioners a five-year plan laying out all transportation infrastructure requirements for the national capital, prioritizing each item. Colonel Dan L. Sultan, the Engineer Commissioner, subsequently distributed Whitehurst's strategic plan to a wide range of federal agencies, private companies (such as utilities and streetcar companies), and citizen groups, seeking their input. The top priority for bridge construction was a new Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge. Whitehurst proposed spending $650,000 in fiscal 1939 to survey and design the structure and begin its construction. Whitehurst's proposal received the immediate support of the Hillcrest Citizens Association, which began lobbying the District Commissioners to seek the appropriation yet again. The City Commissioners duly submitted the budget request, and on January 6, 1938, the Bureau of the Budget submitted to Congress a city budget that listed an underpass at Dupont Circle and the new Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge as its top transportation infrastructure priorities. The authorized cost of the bridge was $2 million, with a 1939 appropriation of $650,000. But the chair of the Subcommittee on Appropriations in the House, Representative Ross A. Collins (D-Mississippi), argued that a far more important project was the K Street viaduct, a proposed elevated highway over K Street NW and Water Street NW between 26th Street NW and Key Bridge. As there was no opposition to the Dupont Circle underpass on fiscal grounds, the bridge appropriation would be deleted.; The subcommittee also added funds for the Thomas Circle underpass. The Washington Board of Trade's bridge committee was outraged, and called for protests by all citizens associations in the city. Adelbert W. Lee, chair of the bridge committee, pointed out that more than 15,000 vehicles a day crossed the bridge (the oldest in the city), and that modern firefighting equipment could not cross the bridge due to weight restrictions. Lee said Collins' claim about opposition was untrue, and that both the Dupont Circle and Thomas Circle underpasses were opposed by some citizens while not a single protest had been registered against the bridge proposal. Nonetheless, the bill went to the House floor on January 27, 1938, without the bridge appropriation. Representative Stephen Warfield Gambrill (D-Maryland) attempted to amend the bill on the floor of the House on February 1 by restoring the funds, but the amendment was not offered after Collins won a Point of order vote against it.; On February 5, the Federation of Citizens Associations passed a resolution advocating cancellation of all underpass construction so that the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge could be rebuilt. In the Subcommittee on Appropriations in the Senate, however, Senator Millard Tydings (D-Maryland) said he would seek to add the bridged appropriation (although he would not hold up the bill if the effort failed). Senator Elmer Thomas (D-Oklahoma) demanded that if Tydings' effort was successful that other projects be cut so as not to raise the overall cost of the bill. Members of the Northeast Washington Citizens Association and the Congress Heights Citizens Association both testified in favor of the Tydings amendment. The subcommittee restored the appropriation on March 2 at a reported $620,000, cancelling the Dupont and Thomas Circle underpasses and the K Street viaduct. The full Appropriations Committee approved the bill on March 3. A conference committee agreed on March 14 to adopt a conference bill that included the bridge appropriation at the Senate level, and the final bill passed Congress on May 18. =Construction of the Sousa Bridge= With funding for the bridge secured, Captain Whitehurst said that plans for the structure should be finalized on June 1, 1938. The construction schedule provide for advertising of contracts in June, and work to begin in mid-August. The downstream span of the structure would be completed before the current bridge was dismantled and a new span built in its place. The total timeframe for construction was 25 to 31 months. The Commission of Fine Arts recommended that the bridge be faced in pink granite. The roadway would be wide. Penker Construction of Cincinnati, Ohio, was awarded the bid to construct the new bridge. Of the 10 bidders, Penker's was the lowest bid at just under $1,821,250. Its contract required the bridge to be built within 400 calendar days after the old bridge is closed. It also required the new bridge to be constructed of pink granite. Penker also won a $23,000 contract to demolish the bridge. About March 5, 1939, a labor dispute halted work in the bridge. The jurisdictional strike occurred in a dispute over whether the steel workers or rod workers union would have the right to trim steel rods on the project. The dispute lasted nearly two weeks. Both unions agreed to return to work on March 19, pending a resolution of their dispute through arbitration.; A second labor dispute halted work on the bridge when 200 members of Sand and Gravel Workers Union Local 22075 went out on strike over a refusal by the Smoot Sand and Gravel Corporation to adopt the closed shop. The strike, which began on August 14, immediately halted concrete work not only on the new Sousa Bridge but on more than 20 building and transportation infrastructure projects, and idled more than 5,000 workers. Howard T. Colvin, a United States Department of Labor conciliator, was called in to help end the dispute. Initially, Colvin expressed optimism that the strike could be settled swiftly. But the union rejected a potential settlement on August 23 because it lacked specific wage and hour agreements. On August 25, Representative William Alvin Pittenger (R-Minnesota) asked the Army Corps of Engineers to break the strike and supply sand and gravel itself. The Army refused. On August 28, the federal government intervened in the strike. Federal Works Agency Administrator John M. Carmody questioned why the single source was used to supply all the sand and gravel to so much projects, and threatened to find a new supplier if a settlement was not forthcoming. John R. Steelman, head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, announced he was personally intervening in the negotiations to bring an end to the strike. Meanwhile, Colvin proposed a strike settlement which was immediately accepted by the union and rejected by the company. Carmody and Steelman's intervention appeared to work. Progress in strike talks was announced on August 30, and on September 5 the company and union ended the strike after agreeing to Colvin's terms. An appropriations request to finish the second span of the bridge was made to city commissioners in September 1939. On October 21, with the downstream span nearing completion, the Highway Engineering & Construction Co. of Washington, D.C., was given a $46,000 contract to pave the span. By the end of November, the downstream span was nearly complete. =Dedication of the first span= The downstream span of the John Philip Sousa Bridge was opened on December 9, 1939, before a crowd of more than 12,000. Nine-year-old Nancy Lee, daughter of Adelbert Lee (president of the Randle Highlands Citizens Association and vice president of the Southeast Business Men's Association) cut the ribbon opening the bridge. Captain Whitehurst presented the bridge to the District Commissioners. Present for the dedication were Sousa's daughters, Jane Priscilla Sousa and Helen Sousa Abert, and Sousa's sister, 89-year-old Catherine Sousa Varela. The United States Marine Band provided the music for the event. Two Boy Scouts, George Durham and Jack Green, played \\"Taps\\" in the direction of nearby Congressional Cemetery (where Sousa was buried). The old Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge span closed the same day as the dedication, and demolition of the span began a few days later. =Construction and dedication of the second span= Looking west at the John Philip Sousa Bridge over the Anacostia River in 1968 Full funding for the completion of the second span was included by the D.C. Commissioners in their federal budget submission for fiscal 1941. There was no dispute over the funding, and the appropriation was made. Work on the second span was temporarily interrupted in July 1940 when 250 workers at Smoot Sand & Gravel walked out to protest a job classification by the federal Wage and Hour Division. The men worked on barges dredging gravel, and wanted to be classified as seamen so they could qualify for overtime and work more than the federally approved 42-hour work week. The strike began on July 9, lasted five days, and idled more than 6,500 workers (including those working on the Social Security and Railroad Retirement Board buildings) as no concrete could be delivered. The men won reclassification as seamen, a 10 percent wage increase, and pay for five days they were idle.; Planning for the span's dedication began in October 1940.; In mid-December, the downstream span was closed and traffic shifted onto the newly completed north span to allow the removal of the temporary division of the south span and its resurfacing. Construction delays, however, meant that the traffic diversion did not occur until January 2, 1941. On December 21, Captain Whitehurst announced that the Sousa Bridge would be completed on January 15, 1941. The north span was formally dedicated in a small ceremony on January 18, 1941. The Ellicott Circle connection When originally completed in 1941, the bridge connected to what was then called Ellicott Circle on the east bank of the Anacostia, but in 1957, the District began work on the Anacostia Freeway, a project that replaced the circle with a freeway interchange and new ramps to Anacostia Drive. Work on the Pennsylvania avenue interchange began in late November of 1961 and completed in May of 1964. The Barney Circle connection The John Philip Sousa Bridge in 1973, with Barney Circle on the far side of the bridge and the Anacostia Freeway interchange in the foreground Looking southwest from Barney Circle along John Philip Sousa Bridge in May 2014 at the now-unused Interstate 695 as it passes beneath the bridge's northern approaches. Construction on the new \\"Southeast Boulevard\\" is under way. When constructed, the Sousa Bridge connected with Barney Circle, a traffic circle that forms the terminus foot of Pennsylvania Avenue SE, Kentucky Avenue SE, 17th Street SE, and M Street SE. A streetcar turnaround and bus lane was carved from the center of the circle, and a $7,000 bus and streetcar terminal occupied the western portion of the site. The terminal opened on January 26, 1941. In 1956, federal and regional transportation planners proposed an Inner Loop Expressway composed of three circumferential beltways for the District of Columbia. The middle beltway would have begun at the proposed Barney Circle Freeway near Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, until it terminated near 37th Street NW at the north end of Georgetown. From 1969 to 1974, the District rebuilt Barney Circle to accommodate the freeway. The turnaround loop and transit stop were removed and the circle dug out. What was to be the Southwest Freeway was built under the circle, with a curving ramp connecting the bridge to the freeway. When the circle was rebuilt, Pennsylvania Avenue was realigned to go straight across the circle. During construction, traffic was rerouted around the circle on a temporary scaffold- like viaduct. But before the project could be finished, the continuation of the freeway north was in trouble. Two decades of protest led to the cancellation of all but the I-395 and I-695 portions of the plan, and the unbuilt portions of the project were finally cancelled in 1977.; ; The failure to complete the Inner Loop left the Sousa Bridge's approaches incomplete and confusing. Unmarked Interstate 695 delivered three lanes of traffic to a one-lane on-ramp to the bridge, and traffic backed up for miles every day as a traffic light allowed only a few cars onto the bridge's southbound lanes during rush hour. An off-ramp delivered most northbound bridge traffic around the incomplete Barney Circle and under the bridge onto Interstate 695 westbound. Ultimately, motorists wanting to access the Baltimore–Washington Parkway or U.S. Route 50 in Maryland (the John Hanson Highway) would often travel Interstate 695 to Barney Circle, wait at the traffic light there, cross the Sousa Bridge, wait at a traffic light on the southwestern terminus of the bridge, and make a left turn against oncoming traffic to access a narrow and dangerous ramp that led to northbound D.C. Route 295 (the Anacostia Freeway). The combination of traffic lights, left turn, and mixing of both through-traffic and local traffic created extensive traffic congestion on the Sousa Bridge during evening rush hour. In 1975, federal, regional, and city transportation planners proposed an extension to I-695/Southeast Freeway to be called the \\"Barney Circle Freeway\\" to help alleviate the problems created by the failure to complete the Inner Loop. The freeway would extend I-695 past its existing terminus at Barney Circle and travel along the western bank of the Anacostia River (through Anacostia Park) to a new bridge over the Anacostia River at Burnham Barrier, providing vehicles easy access to the Anacostia Freeway. The Barney Circle Freeway would have delinked Barney Circle from I-695, and restricted the on- and off-ramps to Sousa Bridge so that the bridge returned to its traditional function as a local bridge rather than a route for commuters to access the Anacostia Freeway and points east in the state of Maryland. The combined bridge and freeway project was ready for construction to begin in 1981, and its cost was estimated to be $93.5 million. But after protests from residents of Capitol Hill (who feared the Barney Circle Freeway would cause more traffic to flow into the area) as well as environmentalists, and legal and regulatory challenges, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) officials agreed in August 1994 to conduct an additional environmental impact assessment regarding the project, but later said the assessment's findings did not alter its earlier conclusion that construction of the roadway and bridge project was economically feasible, technologically appropriate, and environmentally sound. However, the D.C. City Council had the final say on whether to proceed with the project or not. In December 1994, the City Council bowed to neighborhood opposition and voted overwhelmingly to reject the project. In 2009, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) began the replacement of the 11th Street Bridges just down the Anacostia River. It closed and decommissioned the segment of Interstate 695 from the 11th Street Bridges to Barney Circle by early 2013. These changes removed a significant portion of the traffic using Sousa Bridge, from 50,000 vehicles per day (each way) in 2004 to an estimated 35,000 vehicles per day (each way) in 2030. DDOT also redesigned and rebuilt the ramp from Pennsylvania Avenue SE to northbound D.C. Route 295 to improve its safety. Decommissioned Interstate 695 began to be transformed into a boulevard named \\"Southeast Boulevard\\", a four-lane grand boulevard with a landscaped median and pedestrian nature trail designed to link Barney Circle to 11th Street SE. 1994-5 reconstruction From April 1994 to December 1995, the bridge was reconstructed and widened from to , which required the abutments to be widened too. It received a new surface, structural work and new bicycle and pedestrian access. The work strengthened the bridge, widened the lanes from to , widened the sidewalks to accommodate bicycles, created a barrier between the sidewalks and the roadway and added a median barrier. Current status A 2013 DDOT inspection of the Sousa Bridge found it to be structurally sound but only in \\"fair\\" condition. However, two bridges on the Sousa Bridge's eastern end, carrying traffic from the bridge to D.C. Route 295 (passing over an access road in Anacostia Park), were found to be in serious disrepair in July 2014. DDOT subsequently budgeted money in fiscal 2016 to repair the bridges.

The western terminus of NH 27 is in Hooksett at U.S. Route 3 and New Hampshire Route 28 north of Manchester. The eastern terminus is in Hampton Beach at New Hampshire Route 1A, which runs along the New Hampshire coastline adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean. NH 27 is a local highway which parallels the New Hampshire Route 101 expressway for its entire length. NH 27 serves the centers of many of the communities which NH 101 bypasses. Route description Route 27 starts at an intersection with U.S. Route 3 (Hooksett Road) and New Hampshire Route 28 in southern Hooksett. It proceeds east 1/4 mile and crosses New Hampshire 28 Bypass (Londonderry Turnpike), then continues northeast through Hooksett into Candia. Route 27 intersects New Hampshire Route 43 at Candia Four Corners, then continues east and meets NH 107 in the northwest part of Raymond. Turning southeast, the highways run concurrently past the center of Raymond, with NH 107 splitting off to the south in the eastern part of the town. NH 27 continues east into the town of Epping, where it crosses New Hampshire Route 125 (Calef Highway), a major north-south two-lane highway in eastern New Hampshire. NH 27 then continues southeast through southern Epping and reaches northwest Exeter, where it interchanges with New Hampshire Route 101, the major east-west freeway for the region. NH 27 then enters the town center of Exeter, and briefly runs concurrently with New Hampshire Route 111A, before both routes meet NH 111, and NH 111A terminates at its parent. NH 111 and NH 27 run concurrently until separating in the southeast corner of Exeter, west of NH 111's interchange with NH 101. NH 27 continues southeast into Hampton, where it interchanges with NH 101 one last time, before entering Hampton's town center, where it intersects U.S. Route 1. NH 27 continues east, reaching its eastern terminus at NH 1A (Ocean Boulevard) at Hampton's North Beach along the Atlantic Ocean. HistoryHooksett to Candia= 44x44px 45x45px NH 27 was formerly NH 101B from Hooksett to the intersection with NH 43 in Candia. =Candia to Raymond= The section of NH 27 between NH 43 in Candia (the former eastern terminus of NH 101B) and the eastern terminus of the NH 27/New Hampshire Route 107 concurrency in Raymond is part of New Hampshire Route 101 Business, although this segment is not signed as such in the field. Originally, this section of NH 27 was a part of New Hampshire Route 101 until the NH 101 freeway was built in the 1980s. =Raymond to Hampton Beach= 45x45px In the late 1990s, the NH 101 expressway between exit 5 (NH 107) in Raymond and exit 9 near Exeter was completed, allowing NH 101 to shift from its surface alignment between Raymond and Exeter to the freeway. NH 27 was then extended eastward from Raymond along the former routing of NH 101 to NH 108 in Exeter. Additionally, the routing of NH 101C, which ran from NH 108 east along what is now NH 27 to NH 1A in Hampton Beach, was usurped by NH 27, extending NH 27 to its current location. The NH 101C designation was changed in 1990 due to confusion between NH 101C, NH 101D in Exeter and North Hampton, and NH 101E in Hampton. NH 101D is now the easternmost part of NH 111 while NH 101E remains but is poorly signed.New Hampshire Routes 101-125 Junction listReferencesFurther reading * * External links * New Hampshire State Route 27 on Flickr 027 Category:Transportation in Merrimack County, New Hampshire Category:Transportation in Rockingham County, New Hampshire ","title":"New Hampshire Route 27"},{"id":"2006232","text":"Rufus King (January 26, 1814 - October 13, 1876) was an American newspaper editor, public servant, diplomat, and a Union brigadier general in the American Civil War.Rufus King, Wisconsin Historical Society Early life King was born in New York City, New York, to Charles King, president of Columbia College, and Eliza Gracie.Eicher, p. 333, cites the July date of birth; Warner, p. 269, January. He was the grandson of Rufus King, delegate for Massachusetts to the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention. The Kings were part of the King family of Massachusetts, New York and Maine. After graduation from Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School, King enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1829 and graduated the fourth in his class.Cullum, George W.

Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1891. He was commissioned into the United States Corps of Engineers in 1833 but resigned in 1836 to become the New York and Erie Railroad civil engineer. After three years with the railroad, King decided to change his career path and became a newspaper editor. He worked at the Albany Daily Advertiser and the Albany Evening Journal, which were published by Thurlow Weed, a leading figure in the New York's Whig Party. In 1839, King was appointed adjutant general of the New York State Militia by Governor William H. Seward, a political ally of Weed, and held this post until 1843. Family In 1836, King married Ellen Eliot, who died two years into marriage; they had no children. After five years, King married her sister Susan Eliot, and they had two children. His son Rufus King Jr. became a Union Army officer of the U.S. Horse Artillery Brigade and was awarded the Medal of Honor; his other son, Charles King became a Brigadier General of Volunteers during the Spanish–American War and a writer of Western novels. Moving to Wisconsin In 1845, he left New York and moved to the Wisconsin Territory, accomplishing a mixture of politics (member of the 1848 Wisconsin constitutional convention), journalism (editor and part owner of the Milwaukee Sentinel and Gazette), and education (superintendent of schools in Milwaukee in 1859-1860, and a regent of the University of Wisconsin in 1848-1854).Still, Bayrd.

The matches were played at the old State Fairgrounds (what is now the Marquette University campus) during the winter of 1859.Podoll, Brian. The Minor League Milwaukee Brewers. McFarland & Company, 2003. . Civil War King was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as Minister to the Papal States in 1861 after being recommended by the Secretary of State Seward. On his way to Rome when the Civil War broke out, he took a leave of absence to join the Union Army. He was appointed a brigadier general of the Wisconsin militia on April 15, 1861, and of U.S. Volunteers on May 17, and was given authorization to raise a Wisconsin regiment. King helped organize what came to be known as the famous Iron Brigade, the Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Wisconsin, and Nineteenth Indiana volunteers, which he commanded briefly.Ethan S. Rafuse. King, Rufus, American National Biography Online. February 2000. Retrieved January 26, 2016. However, before the Iron Brigade saw combat, King was promoted on March 13, 1862 to command of a division (which included the Iron Brigade) in the I Corps of the Army of the Potomac replacing general Irvin McDowell. The Division's first action was in the Second Battle of Bull Run in August 1862.Hennessy, John J. Return to Bull Run: The Campaign and Battle of Second Manassas. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1993.Gaff, Alan D. Brave Men's Tears: The Iron Brigade at Brawner Farm. Dayton, Ohio: Morningside, 1988. On August 28, 1862, King received orders to advance on Warrenton Turnpike towards Centreville, Virginia. Later in the day, his division was attacked by Confederate forces under Stonewall Jackson's command. Suffering from epileptic seizures, King spent the battle in an ambulance wagon and turned over command of the division to Brig. Gen John P. Hatch, the ranking brigade commander. Hatch then led King's division at Second Bull Run and during the Maryland Campaign until being wounded at South Mountain. In December 1862, King served on the court-martial of Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter for disobedience and cowardice at Second Bull Run. King performed garrison duty at Fort Monroe, Virginia, and was a military governor of Norfolk. His epileptic seizures became more frequent, and in October 1863, King resigned his commission, and succeeded Richard Milford Blatchford as Minister to the Papal States. He served until the end of 1867, and was instrumental in apprehending John Surratt in Rome.Stock, Leo F. United States Ministers to the Papal States: Instructions and Despatches, 1848-1868. Washington, D.C: Catholic University Press, 1933, pp. 278-440. Postbellum career Returning to New York from Rome in 1868, King served for two years as deputy comptroller of customs for the Port of New York, but then retired on account of failing health. He quietly lived in retirement until he died in New York City in 1876. He is buried in Grace Churchyard, Jamaica, New York.

Organic materials in the liquid are catabolized by a microbial ecosystem. A septic drain field, a septic tank, and associated piping compose a septic system. The drain field typically consists of an arrangement of trenches containing perforated pipes and porous material (often gravel) covered by a layer of soil to prevent animals (and surface runoff) from reaching the wastewater distributed within those trenches.Steel, E.W. & McGhee, Terence J. \\"Water Supply and Sewerage\\"McGraw-Hill Book Company (1979) pp.576-577 Primary design considerations are both hydraulic for the volume of wastewater requiring disposal and catabolic for the long-term biochemical oxygen demand of that wastewater. The land area that is set aside for the septic drain field may be called a septic reserve area (SRA). Sewage farms similarly dispose of wastewater through a series of ditches and lagoons (often with little or no pre-treatment). These are more often found in arid countries as the waterflow on the surface allows for irrigation (and fertilization) of agricultural land. Design Cross-section of weeping tile and leach field Many health departments require a percolation test (\\"perc\\" test) to establish the suitability of drain field soil to receive septic tank effluent. An engineer, soil scientist, or licensed designer may be required to work with the local governing agency to design a system that conforms to these criteria. A more progressive way to determine leach field sizing is by direct observation of the soil profile. In this observation, the engineer evaluates many features of the soil such as texture, structure, consistency, pores/roots, etc. The goal of percolation testing is to ensure the soil is permeable enough for septic tank effluent to percolate away from the drain field, but fine grained enough to filter out pathogenic bacteria and viruses before they travel far enough to reach a water well or surface water supply. Coarse soils - sand and gravel - can transmit wastewater away from the drain field before pathogens are destroyed. Silt and clay effectively filter out pathogens but allow very limited wastewater flow rates.Alth, Max & Charlotte \\"Constructing and Maintaining your Well & Septic System\\" Tab Books (1984) pp.166-167 Percolation tests measure the rate at which clean water disperses through a disposal trench into the soil. Several factors may reduce observed percolation rates when the drain field receives anoxic septic tank effluent:Alth, Max & Charlotte \\"Constructing and Maintaining your Well & Septic System\\" Tab Books (1984) p.217329x329px *Microbial colonies catabolizing soluble organic compounds from the septic tank effluent will adhere to soil particles and reduce the interstitial area available for water flow between soil particles. These colonies tend to form a low-permeability biofilm of gelatinous slime at the soil interface of the disposal trench.Alth, Max & Charlotte \\"Constructing and Maintaining your Well & Septic System\\" Tab Books (1984) pp.164-165&219 *Insoluble particles small enough to be carried through the septic tank will accumulate at the soil interface of the disposal trench; non-biodegradable particles like synthetic fiber lint from laundry, mineral soil from washing, or bone and eggshell fragments from garbage disposals will remain to fill interstitial areas formerly available for water flow out of the trench.Alth, Max & Charlotte \\"Constructing and Maintaining your Well & Septic System\\" Tab Books (1984) p.219 *Cooking fats or petroleum products emulsified by detergents or dissolved by solvents can flow through prior to anaerobic liquefaction when septic tank volume is too small to offer adequate residence time, and may congeal as a hydrophobic layer on the soil interface of the disposal trench.Hammer, Mark J. \\"Water and Waste-water Technology\\" John Wiley & Sons (1975) pp.407-408 *Rising groundwater levels may reduce the available hydraulic head (or vertical distance) causing gravitational water flow away from the disposal trench. Effluent initially flowing downward from the disposal trench might ultimately encounter groundwater or impermeable rock or clay requiring a directional shift to horizontal movement away from the drain field. A certain vertical distance is required between the effluent level in the disposal trench and the water level applicable when the effluent leaves the drain field in order for gravitational force to overcome viscous frictional forces resisting flow through porous soil. Effluent levels in the vicinity of the drain field will rise toward the ground surface to preserve that vertical distance difference if groundwater levels surrounding the drain field approach the level of effluent in the disposal trench. *Frozen ground may seasonally reduce the cross-sectional area available for flow or evaporation. = Catabolic design = Just as a septic tank is sized to support a community of anaerobic organisms capable of liquefying anticipated amounts of putrescible materials in wastewater, a drain field should be sized to support a community of aerobic soil microorganisms capable of decomposing the anaerobic septic tank's effluent into aerobic water. Hydrogen sulfide odors or iron bacteria may be observed in nearby wells or surface waters when effluent has not been completely oxidized prior to reaching those areas. The biofilm on the walls of the drain field trenches will use atmospheric oxygen in the trenches to catabolize organic compounds in septic tank effluent. Groundwater flow is laminar in the aquifer soils surrounding the drain field.Linsley, Ray K. & Franzini, Joseph B. \\"Water- Resources Engineering (2nd Ed.)\\" McGraw-Hill Book Company (1972) , p.88 Septic tank effluent with soluble organic compounds passing through the biofilm forms a mounded lens atop the groundwater underlying the drain field. Molecular diffusion controls the mixing of soluble organic compounds into the groundwater and the transport of oxygen from underlying groundwater or the capillary fringe of the groundwater surface, to micro-organisms capable of catabolizing dissolved organic compounds remaining in the effluent plume.Perry, Robert H., Chilton, Cecil H. & Kirkpatrick, Sidney D. \\"Chemical Engineers' Handbook (4th Ed.)\\" McGraw-Hill Book Company (1963) p.14-13 =Biofilter= When a septic tank is used in combination with a biofilter, the height and catabolic area of the drain field may be reduced. Biofilter technology may allow higher density residential construction, minimal site disturbance and more usable land for trees, swimming pools, or gardens. With adequate routine maintenance it may reduce the chances of the drain field plugging up. The biofilter will not reduce the volume of liquid that must percolate into soil, but it may reduce the oxygen demand of organic materials in that liquid. Septic drain field exposed by erosion.  Operation and maintenance Dosing schedules or resting periods= A drain field may be designed to offer several separate disposal areas for effluent from a single septic tank. One area may be \\"rested\\" while effluent is routed to a different area. The nematode community in the resting drain field continues feeding on the accumulated biofilm and fats when the anaerobic septic tank effluent is no longer available. This natural cleansing process may reduce bioclogging to improve the hydraulic capacity of the field by increasing the available interstitial area of the soil as the accumulated organic material is oxidized. The percolation rate after resting may approach, but is unlikely to match, the original clean water percolation rate of the site. =Inappropriate wastes= Septic tank and drain field microorganisms have very limited capability for catabolizing petroleum products and chlorinated solvents, and cannot remove dissolved metals; although some may be absorbed into septic tank sludge or drain field soils, and concentrations may be diluted by other groundwater in the vicinity of the drain field. Cleaning formulations may reduce drain field efficiency. Laundry bleach may slow or stop microbial activity in the drain field, and sanitizing or deodorizing chemicals may have similar effects. Detergents, solvents and drain cleaners may transport emulsified, saponified or dissolved fats into the drain field before they can be catabolized into short-chain organic acids in the septic tank scum layer.

After retiring as a player, he spent 14 months as manager of AFC Bournemouth. After a seven-year spell as manager of National League club Havant & Waterlooville, he took charge of National League South side Eastbourne Borough in May 2019, but left in November 2019 and became assistant head coach at EFL League Two club Crawley Town. Playing career When he was an army recruit, Bradbury played part-time when on leave for Halstead Town under 18 side, and during the 1994–95 season Cowes Sports. Prior to this Bradbury had been a young player at local island side Plessey Sports FC, also based in his hometown of Cowes, Isle of Wight, playing alongside his father Michael. Bradbury also played for Northern Irish side Fivemiletown United while stationed in Northern Ireland with the army. Bradbury started his professional career at Portsmouth, where he played for three years. A number of impressive performances in the 1996–97 season resulted in interest from a number of clubs, and in July 1997 he was purchased by Manchester City manager Frank Clark for a club record £3 million. However, Bradbury struggled to make an impact at Maine Road, and at the end of the 1997–98 season City were relegated, with Bradbury having scored just six goals. Three months into the following season Bradbury moved to Crystal Palace for £1.5 million. Less than a year later Bradbury was on the move again, returning to Portsmouth for £300,000. Bradbury's career started to recover at Pompey, making more than 100 appearances in his second spell at the club. However, in the 2002–03 season Bradbury lost his first team place and was loaned out to Sheffield Wednesday. He returned from his loan spell to contribute three appearances and one goal (ironically against Sheffield Wednesday) to Portsmouth's title run-in as they won the First Division title and promotion to the Premier League. The following season he was loaned to Derby County before being sold to Walsall in March 2004 (where he scored once against former club Derby). At the end of the 2004–05 season Bradbury was playing for Oxford United. Bradbury signed a four-month contract with Southend United on 31 January 2006. He subsequently signed a longer contract. In August 2007, Bradbury signed for AFC Bournemouth on a four-month loan deal. After playing one game for the club the loan was made permanent, and Bradbury signed a contract until the end of the season.Bournemouth bag striker Bradbury In the later stages of Bradbury's career, he played in a much different role, being converted into a right back for Bournemouth during an injury crisis he became the first choice right back for the south coast club, but with the arrival of defender Stephen Purches, who returned after three seasons away from Bournemouth, Bradbury went back to his former role of striker whilst attacking options were limited. Management careerAFC Bournemouth= On 15 January 2011, Bradbury was appointed as caretaker manager after the departure of Eddie Howe to Burnley. The next day, he announced his retirement from playing, and on 28 January, was given a two-and-a-half-year deal as permanent manager of the club. In January 2012, Bradbury signed an improved three-and-a- half-year contract to manage the League One club, keeping him at Bournemouth until the summer of 2015. During his first season at the helm, Bradbury steered the Cherries into the League One Play-offs, eventually losing to Huddersfield on penalties. On 25 March, during his second season, Bradbury was dismissed from Bournemouth following the club's run of poor form. =Havant & Waterlooville= Bradbury was appointed manager of Conference South club Havant & Waterlooville on 9 October 2012. At the time, Bradbury was coaching the Under-14s at Portsmouth's Academy set up In his first game as manager, his side won 2–1 against Basingstoke Town on 13 October 2012. Following Michael Appleton's departure to become manager at Blackpool, Bradbury was linked with a return to Portsmouth, however Guy Whittingham was appointed instead. On 30 April 2016, Havant & Waterlooville's relegation from the National League South was confirmed. A whole season in The Isthmian league followed (Havant and Waterlooville being favourites to get promoted), and promotion was achieved on the last day of the season on 22 April 2017. Bradbury earned the 'Manager of the year' award for winning the league. Hawks played the 2017–18 season back in the National League South and won it at the first attempt, gaining promotion to the National League Premier Division. =Eastbourne Borough and Crawley Town= Bradbury moved to Eastbourne Borough in May 2019, and managed the National League South club until November of that year. In December 2019 he was appointed assistant head coach of Crawley Town in League Two, alongside newly appointed head coach John Yems. Personal life Lee Bradbury spent time in the army before entering the world of football. His son Harvey is also a footballer.

Gonzales, 435 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir. 2006), was a lawsuit filed by John Gilmore against various United States executive and independent agencies and departments, and United Airlines.

Gilmore also complained about being subject to \\"secret law,\\" when the airlines and government refused to show the directive under which they were requesting ID.

His family moved to Bytown, which was later renamed Ottawa, in 1827.  Political life  Friel was elected to Bytown's first town council in 1847. He was defeated the following year, but elected alderman in 1850, 1853 and 1854, when he was elected mayor. He also served on the executive of the Bytown Mechanics' Institute. The municipality of Bytown became the new city of Ottawa in 1855. Friel was elected alderman there from 1855 to 1858 and in 1864, 1865 and 1867. In 1863, he was a member of the first Board of Police Commissioners for Ottawa. The board, with the aim of avoiding unnecessary expense, originally concluded that there was no need for a salaried police force in the city. However, in May that same year, the militia had to be called in to control a riot in the city. In 1865, a bylaw was introduced establishing an official police force. In 1868, while mayor, Friel posted a proclamation announcing a $2,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the assassin of Thomas D'Arcy McGee.  Professional life  In 1846, he purchased the Bytown Packet, a local newspaper, with John George Bell. He sold this paper in October 1849 to Robert Bell, who renamed it the Ottawa Citizen in 1849. In 1858, he established a new paper, the Ottawa Union, also referred to as the Daily Union. He later sold it to a rival paper, the Ottawa Times in 1866.  Personal life  He died in Ottawa in 1869 of pneumonia while still in office. His funeral sermon was delivered in Notre-Dame Cathedral (Ottawa) on Wednesday, 19 May 1869 by Aeneas Mcdonell Dawson.

His approach, as director of Ancient Egypt Research Associates (AERA), is to conduct interdisciplinary archaeological investigation.AERA Every excavated object is examined by specialists to create an overall picture of an archaeological site—from the buildings down to the pollen spores. His international team currently runs the Giza Plateau Mapping Project, excavating and mapping the ancient city of the builders of the Giza pyramid complex, which dates to the fourth dynasty of Egypt. He discovered that Pyramid G1-a, one of the subsidiary pyramids of the Great Pyramid, belonged to Hetepheres I; it was originally thought to belong to Queen Meritites I. Education and career Sphinx at Giza Plateau in Egypt Lehner first went to Egypt as a student in the 1970s. Intrigued by the mysteries of the \\"Sleeping Prophet\\", Edgar Cayce, Lehner \\"found that [my] initial notions about the ancient civilization along the Nile could not stand up to the bedrock reality of the Giza Plateau\\".Lehner, Mark. \\"AERA. A Note from AERA's director\\" He turned to the scientific method of discovery in order to understand the culture better, returning some years later to complete a doctoral degree at Yale University. Lehner's 1991 dissertation was titled Archaeology of an image: The Great Sphinx of Giza. Lehner's team has more recently included parts of Menkaure's valley temple and the town attached to the monument of Queen Khentkawes in their excavations. AERA's 2009 field season was recorded in a blog.Hunt, Brian V. \\"An archaeology blog from the Giza Pyramids in Egypt\\", 2009. AERA has conducted a number of archaeological field schools for Egyptian antiquities inspectors under the auspices of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. The AERA team has run basic and advanced courses at Giza, as well as courses in salvage archaeology along the Avenue of Sphinxes north of Luxor Temple in the city of Luxor. Among his other work in Egypt, Lehner has produced the only known scale maps of the Giza Sphinx. Lehner's book, \\"The Complete Pyramids\\" (1997), is an exhaustive catalogue of Egypt's many pyramid sites. He has appeared in many television programs about Ancient Egypt. He is a visiting assistant professor of Egyptian archaeology at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. Lehner took part in an American Association for the Advancement of Science debate centered around controversy surrounding the age of the Sphinx at Giza. Lehner has also starred and aided in the production of several documentaries about the pyramids which are regularly aired on the National Geographic Channel. He has consistently insisted that the Giza Necropolis was built in a span of 85 years between 2589 and 2504 BC, despite continued opposition from fringe theorists such as Graham Hancock and Robert Schoch who believe them to be much older.http://www.aeraweb.org/projects/how- old-are-the-pyramids/ Television creditsCrew= *Into the Great Pyramid (2002) (TV) (consultant: archaeology) *Mysteries of Egypt (1998) (scientific consultant) *Saving the Sphinx (1998) (TV) (historical consultant) = Appearances = *Pyramides: Les Mystères Révélés (2019) (TV) *Secret History Of The Sphinx (2017) (TV) *Riddles of the Sphinx (2010) (TV) *Heritage Key: Pyramid Builders (2009) (TV) *Into the Great Pyramid (2002) (TV) *Secrets of the Pharaohs: Lost City of the Pyramids (2001) (TV) *Saving the Sphinx (1998) (TV) *Egypt: Secrets of the Pharaohs (1997) (TV) *Mummies: Tales from the Egyptian Crypts (1996) (TV) *The Mystery of the Sphinx (1993) (TV) *This Old Pyramid (1992) (TV) *Mysteries of the Pyramids, LIVE (1988) (TV) Books * The Egyptian Heritage: Based on the Edgar Cayce Readings, Virginia Beach: A.R.E.

The term was first introduced by civil rights leader James Charles Evers in 1968; however, it was popularized by Richard Nixon in a televised speech August 1969. An early model of workfare had been pioneered in 1961 by Joseph Mitchell in Newburgh, New York. Traditional welfare benefits systems are usually awarded based on certain conditions, such as searching for work, or based on meeting criteria that would position the recipient as unavailable to seek employment or be employed. Under workfare, recipients have to meet certain participation requirements to continue to receive their welfare benefits. These requirements are often a combination of activities that are intended to improve the recipient's job prospects (such as training, rehabilitation, and work experience) and those designated as contributing to society (such as unpaid or low-paid work). These programs, now common in Australia (known as \\"mutual obligation\\"), Canada, and the United Kingdom, have generated considerable debate and controversy. In the Netherlands workfare is known as Work First, based on the Wisconsin Works program from the United States. There are two main types of workfare scheme: those that encourage direct employment to get individuals off the welfare roll and directly into the workforce, and those that are intended to increase human capital by providing training and education to those currently in the welfare system. In less developed countries, similar schemes are designed to alleviate rural poverty among day-labourers by providing state-subsidised temporary work during those periods of the year when little agricultural work is available. For example, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) in India offers 100 days' paid employment per year for those eligible, rather than unemployment benefits on the Western model. However, a workfare model typically not only focuses on provision of social protection through a wage- income transfer, but also supports workers to get into work.  Goals  The purported main goal of workfare is to generate a \\"net contribution\\" to society from welfare recipients. Most commonly, it means getting unemployed people into paid work, reducing or eliminating welfare payments to them and creating an income that generates taxes. Workfare participants may retain certain employee rights throughout the process, however, often workfare programs are determined to be \\"outside employment relationships\\" and therefore the rights of beneficiaries can be different. Some workfare systems also aim to derive a contribution from welfare recipients by more direct means. Such systems obligate unemployed people to undertake work that is considered beneficial to their community. Criticism Workfare schemes in the UK are controversial. In the UK, critics point out that the type of work offered by workfare providers is generally unskilled and is comparable to community work carried out by criminal offenders being punished on community service schemes. Many charities and workers' unions have criticized workfare schemes for undermining the work done by actual charity volunteers, and acting as a threat to low paid unskilled workers. In Australia, the Work for the Dole schemes have been linked to the concepts of “mutual obligation” and \\"compliance\\". Their effectiveness has been questioned by researchers.

The band first backed The Chosen Few in the early 1970s before joining with successful solo artist Jacob Miller and releasing a string of records. This era of the band ended with Miller's death in a car crash in 1980. The group reformed in 1986. During this period, they released several international hit singles, including \\"Sweat (A La La La La Long)\\" and \\"Bad Boys,\\" the theme from the American television show Cops. The group continued to record and tour thereafter. Brothers Ian and Roger Lewis have remained the group's consistent members, playing bass and guitar, respectively. Other long-term members include keyboardist Bernard \\"Touter\\" Harvey, a member since 1973, and drummer Lancelot Hall, who joined during their 1986 reformation. The band's lineup is completed by singer Trevor \\"Skatta\\" Bonnick and lead guitarist Andre Philips. CareerEarly history (1968-1974)= Inner Circle was formed in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1968, by the brothers Ian Lewis and Roger Lewis with then 12-year-old Stephen \\"Cat\\" Coore and Michael Cooper.Thompson, Dave (2002) Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, , p. 121-4, 442 They appeared on record in 1970, backing The Chosen Few on the Derrick Harriott-produced single \\"Why Can't I Touch You\\", with the Inner Circle Band credited with the instrumental version on the B-side. This was one of several singles on which they backed the Chosen Few. In 1970 the band was expanded when they were joined by drummer William Stewart, percussionist Irvin \\"Carrot\\" Jarrett, and singer William \\"Bunny Rugs\\" Clarke. The band played on Eric Donaldson's hit single \\"Cherry Oh Baby\\" and recorded their own version as \\"Red Cherry\\". Jarrett left the band in 1972, with singer Clarke leaving the following year when he moved to New York. Clarke's replacement was Milton \\"Prilly\\" Hamilton, but this line-up was short-lived as the band split in two with Coore, Cooper, and Hamilton leaving to form Third World in 1973. Coore and Cooper were then students of the University of the West Indies, studying for various degrees and were soon joined in Third World by fellow Inner Circle departees Clarke and Jarrett. Meanwhile, Inner Circle re-tooled the lineup by recruiting keyboard players Charles Farquharson and Bernard Harvey (aka \\"Touter\\"), as well as drummer Calvin McKenzie as a replacement for Stewart (who would also go on to play with Third World). The band played the hotel and club circuit in Kingston, playing a mixture of reggae, pop and soul hits, and released their first album, Dread Reggae Hits, in 1973 on Ian Lewis's Top Ranking label.Lane, Sarah (1980) \\"Florida Challenge for Jamaicans: Top Ranking Sounds Struggling for U.S. Recognition\\", Billboard, 6 December 1980, p. 27, retrieved 9 September 2012 =The Jacob Miller years= After recording with singer Funky Brown, they recruited Jacob Miller as a permanent vocalist (although he continued to record as a solo artist), and had a hit single with a version of The Stylistics' \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\". Some of Miller's work with the band was credited to Miller alone, including the \\"Tenement Yard\\" single. The band were signed by Capitol Records, who issued the albums Reggae Thing (1976) and Ready for the World (1977). They toured the United States with American guitarist, Ed Elizalde. In 1978 they moved on to Island Records who released the Everything Is Great album in 1978, which included the UK hit singles \\"Everything Is Great\\" and \\"Stop Breaking My Heart\\", and New Age Music the following year. The band was joined by New York session guitarist Joe Ortiz, dubbed 'Gitzy' by the band; who added the first touches of hard rock, jazz, and blues to the group and to Reggae in general. Ortiz recorded at Compass Point Studios for the Everything Is Great album on Island Records, and later joined the group for their European tour in 1978–1980. He was also lead guitarist on the title track 'New Age Music' on the album of the same name. Lester Adderley joined the group for the New Age Music album on guitar. Also released in the late 1970s were two dub albums based on Miller's solo albums Killer Miller and Wanted but credited to Inner Circle. The band gained further exposure via their performance in the film Rockers, playing a hotel house band. At his peak in the 1970s, only Bob Marley was more popular in Jamaica than Miller, and as a live act nobody equaled their popularity.Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd ed., Rough Guides, , p. 200, 242 Miller's death in a car crash on 23 March 1980 led the band to split up, with the Lewis Brothers and Touter Harvey moving to Miami, where they opened a studio in a warehouse, later opening their own Circle House recording studio, and the band has been based in Miami since then. After Miller's death in 1980, the band had one more American tour, inviting Norman Grant from the Twinkle Brothers for vocals. =Reformation and US success= In 1981, with Bay Area lead guitarist, Mark Castro, they recorded the album Something So Good. Due to the loss of Jacob Miller, the members asked Mark Castro to help them find a new vocalist. Mark brought Rick Hunt to the band. \\"Something So Good\\" includes the memorable signature lead guitar solos that only Mark Castro can produce, especially When a Man Loves a Woman and World 2000.\\"Something So Good\\" was released in 1982. They reformed in 1986 with the Lewis Brothers and Harvey joined by singer Calton Coffie and drummer Lancelot Hall, and this line-up released the Black Roses album (released in 1986 on RAS Records). The band's next album, One Way in 1987, included one of their biggest hits, \\"Bad Boys\\", which was re-recorded for their 1989 album Identified and became the theme music for the Fox TV series Cops that year.Walker, Klive (2005) Dubwise, Insomniac Press, , p. 203 California guitarist Dave Gonzales, by Mark Castro's recommendation, joined the band for a tour in 1989. \\"Bad Boys\\" was reissued as a single in 1990 and charted in several countries in Europe, but it was its 1993 re-release in the United States that achieved the greatest success. The 1992 album Bad to the Bone was picked up by Atlantic Records and reissued as Bad Boys in 1993 to capitalize on the success of the single. It sold more than half a million copies in the United States and more than four million worldwide.Benarde, Scott (1993), \\"Reggae in music's inner circle: Boys of 'COPS' TV theme start to make it big\\", Austin American-Statesman, 16 December 1993, p. 14 The band received a Grammy Award in 1993 for 'Best Reggae Album by Duo or Group' for Bad Boys and the album also spawned the international hit single \\"Sweat (A La La La La Long)\\", which was a #3 hit in the UK Singles Chart and topped the chart in 10 countries, selling over a million copies in Europe, while \\"Bad Boys\\" peaked at #52.Bass, Debra (1994) \\"Inner Circle: Bad Boys are Back\\", Vibe, November 1994, p. 80, retrieved 9 September 2012 It was their second (and last) American hit, reaching #16 on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Bad Boys\\" was used in the 1995 film of the same name starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence and its sequels Bad Boys II and Bad Boys for Life, and a ringtone based on the song was on the Billboard Hot Ringtones Chart for over 110 weeks.Schneider, Christopher J. \\"The Ringtone as an Identity Management Device\\", in Denzin, Norman K.

They produced the song \\"Start the Commotion\\" which was featured in a Mitsubishi TV advertisement, as well as the films Lizzie McGuire, Zoolander and Kangaroo Jack. Another of their singles, \\"Ooh La La\\", was used in the film Big Daddy and Budweiser commercials. Both tracks are from the duo's second album, The Antidote.  Career  The band was formed in 1994 with two members, Touché (Theo Keating) and Regal (Paul Eve). They were music production partners from 1990 and released an EP called Ladies Say Ow! in 1994 on the Blackmarket International record label. The record label Wall of Sound signed the duo and released the double A-side \\"Nil by Mouth\\" / \\"Too Easy\\" in 1995. Their first album, Executive Suite was released in 1996 to critical acclaim, feature downtempo jazz beats and happy optimistic hip-hop numbers, and is now considered a cult classic. Regal left the band in 1997 to pursue his career as co-founder of the UK's Bronx Dogs, and Touché worked on the second Wiseguys album, The Antidote. This was released in 1998, and contained their two most well-known songs, \\"Ooh La La\\" and \\"Start the Commotion\\". \\"Ooh La La\\" was a minor UK hit in April 1998, but in March 1999 it was re-released as a single and went to No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart following its use in a popular TV commercial for Budweiser.

Previously he was Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court of Hungary from 1990 to 1998.  Biography  He was born in the southern Hungarian city of Pécs. He graduated in law from the University of Pécs in 1965. He worked as a professor at universities and law institutes in Budapest: at the Eötvös Loránd University from 1983, at Péter Pázmány Catholic University from 1996, and at Andrássy Gyula German Language University of Budapest from 2002. He also worked in Jena, Germany for 3 years. His political career began as legal advisor for civil and environmental organisations in the late 1980s. As a founder of Danube Circle, he also had a significant role in environmental protection issues like preventing the construction of the Gabčíkovo - Nagymaros Dams which, according to the Danube Circle, would have damaged the habitat of a northern part of the Danube. He was one of the founders of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) in 1987, and represented that party in the Opposition Roundtable negotiations that played a very important part in Hungary's transition to parliamentary democracy. In 1989, for a short time he was member of the executive committee of the MDF. Presidents of the Visegrád Group However, he left party politics in late 1989, as he was elected into the Constitutional Court of Hungary. He gained the presidency of the court half year later, and held that position until 1998. During this time, the Constitutional Court had a very important role in laying the groundwork for and strengthening democracy in Hungary. In this role, he significantly contributed to the removal of capital punishment, the protection of information rights, the freedom of opinion and of conscience, as well as the constitutional protection of domestic partnerships of homosexuals, which measures brought wide international acclaim for the Constitutional Court of Hungary. He had a controversial principle of activism based on the invisible constitution, motivating the decisions of the Court by the 'spirit' or 'morals' of the Constitution rather than its explicitly written form, advocating the principle of equality even over the letters of the constitution. After the end of his nine-year-long mandate, he continued his scholarly career, continued giving lectures in universities, and became founder of Védegylet, an environmentalist and civil rights non-governmental organisation in 2000. He became corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2001 and a full member in 2013. Sólyom is widowed, has two children and eleven grandchildren.  Presidential election  He was nominated by the environmentalist civil organisation Védegylet, including notable public figures from both the left and the right wing. As the Constitution of Hungary specifies, the President is elected by the Parliament of Hungary, so he had to acquire the support of Parliamentary parties. The opposition parties, Fidesz and Hungarian Democratic Forum, also endorsed him to become President of Hungary. However, if the governing parties had been united in support of the Hungarian Socialist Party candidate, Katalin Szili, Sólyom would not have secured enough votes to take the Presidency; but because Szili was not acceptable to the Alliance of Free Democrats, the smaller party in the governing coalition, they abstained from voting, and Sólyom's election was secured.  The three pillars of the presidency of László Sólyom  * Maintaining the values of the rule of law in Hungary * Expressing distinctive responsibility for the ethnic Hungarian minority groups living abroad in the neighboring countries of Hungary * Calling the Hungarian and the international public’s attention to environmental and ecological issues, such as the importance of biodiversity or the risks of climate change  Relevant public events of President László Sólyom 2005= 5 August László Sólyom was inaugurated in his office at a ceremony in the Mirror Hall of Sándor Palace. 20 August In his first ceremonial speech he formulated that “Let us be aware that we are a medium-sized country among the EU Member States, and we, too, are contributing to shaping whatever is to happen and what could happen in the European Union.” (full text) 8 December In his toast at the gala-dinner offered by Ivan Ğašparovič, President of the Slovak Republic, László Sólyom underlined that \\"The peoples' memory keeps the offences through generations and to avoid that these become prejudice and in order to ease them it is necessary to set them on the agenda to clear comprehensive historical processes and inherences, to eliminate taboo subjects and to show mutual empathy.\\" (full text) =2006= 27 January In his address on the Memorial Day of the Holocaust he said that “The absolute breaking of law that happened is confirming the law not only for the people which suffered of it but for the whole unity of mankind.

Original episodes were broadcast from 1985 to 1989. Night Heat was the first Canadian original drama series that was also aired on a United States television network during its original broadcast. It was also the first original, first-run drama series to be aired during a late night time slot on a television network in the United States. During its original run it was the highest-rated Canadian-produced original series in Canada. The show won the Gemini Award for Best Drama Series in both 1986 and 1987. The show stars Scott Hylands and Jeff Wincott as police detectives Kevin O'Brien and Frank Giambone who work the graveyard shift in an unnamed northeastern North American metropolis. The series follows their nightly police beat as it is chronicled by journalist Tom Kirkwood (Allan Royal) in his newspaper column titled \\"Night Heat\\". Synopsis Allan Royal plays Tom Kirkwood, a journalist who writes a newspaper column titled \\"Night Heat\\" where he chronicles the nightly police beat of detectives Kevin O'Brien, played by Scott Hylands, and Frank Giambrone, played by Jeff Wincott. O'Brien is a tough, cynical, veteran police officer and Giambrone is his younger, hot- tempered partner. Kirkwood also serves as the show's narrator; his voice-over commentary starts and ends each episode, recapping the lessons learned and acting as a sort of Greek chorus. The name of the city in which the show takes place is never mentioned. Each episode represents a single night's shift and, as a result, crimes often remain unresolved by the end of the show.

Grosso served was the show's executive producer along with his partner, Larry Jacobson. Grosso had over 20 years experience in law enforcement, later working as a narcotics detective. He and his former NYPD partner, Eddie Egan, were the detectives responsible for bringing an end to the infamous drug smuggling ring known as the French Connection. Grosso served as technical adviser on the film based on the investigation. He also worked as a consultant for the film The Godfather and as story editor for the TV series The Rockford Files, Kojak and Baretta. Grosso and Jacobson were originally approached by CBS to produce a docudrama series following actual police officers, but they considered the potential risk in filming people who had not yet been convicted of a crime and decided against it. Grosso came up with the idea of creating a police series that would feature a realistic look at police work in a documentary style, similar to the 1950s/1960s police drama Naked City. He wanted to depict the life of the everyday police officer, in contrast to the slicker, high-action, high- drama, yuppie-oriented police series of the time such as Miami Vice and Hill Street Blues. The pilot episode was written by Don Flynn, a crime reporter with the New York Daily News. =Filming= 220px Grosso and Jacobson decided to produce their show in Toronto, Canada, as otherwise the production costs would have been too expensive for CBS's late-night budget. At the time one could film in Toronto for less than half the cost of a major American city—Canadian union scale was lower and the American-to-Canadian dollar exchange rate was also favorable. The show featured an all-Canadian cast and crew and was partially funded by the Government of Canada. For Hylands, a 21-year veteran actor, frequently seen playing villains in U.S. TV shows during the 1970s and early 1980s, this was the first time he had been given a leading role, or the role of a \\"good guy.\\" The series was shot entirely at night between the hours of 6pm and 4am, which also made it easier to film since there was less traffic and it was easier to close down streets. The lower budget also meant that the show did not contain high speed car chases or shootouts with heavy calibre weapons. As a result, the show was more reliant on story and dialogue to capture audiences. Night Heat was filmed on 16mm film using hand-held cameras, instead of the Hollywood-standard 35mm film, giving the series a grainy, documentary-style look. Much of the show was shot at the site of the former Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital, which served as the series' police station; described as a \\"grim and forbidding setting,\\" the hospital fit in with the gritty look that the show's producer, Robert Lantos wanted. Filming a police drama aimed at both Canadian and American audiences in an unidentified city presented a unique set of challenges: The crew had to avoid capturing shots of landmarks and other objects that would give away that it was not an American city, such as Toronto Police cars, Esso stations and the CN Tower. While much of the show's dialogue included American law-enforcement terminology (for example: they referred to police \\"precincts\\" instead of \\"divisions\\", and characters had ranks such as officers, detectives and lieutenants instead of constables, sergeants and inspectors), they avoided terms from the American criminal justice system such as \\"grand jury\\" or \\"district attorney\\". In addition, the officers were never seen reading Miranda rights to suspects since there is no Miranda law in Canada. The writers also made a concerted effort to avoid using words that Canadians have a distinctive way of pronouncing, such as the words \\"out\\" and \\"about\\". Given Toronto's relative cleanliness when compared to larger American cities, the film crew would sometimes throw additional garbage onto the set during street scenes. Grosso, Hylands and Jacobson have all said in separate interviews that there was a time when the garbage that they had strewn about for a Night Heat shoot had been cleaned-up by city sanitation crews while the film crew was on break. EpisodesSeries overview=Season 1 (1985–86)=Season 2 (1986–87)=Season 3 (1987–88)=Season 4 (1988–89)=Broadcast CBS aired Night Heat as part of CBS Late Night, a late-night block of drama programming. It marked the first time in 20 years that CBS had slotted a first-run series against The Tonight Show. For six weeks in the summer of 1987 CBS moved the show to a 9pm slot, making it the first time that a Canadian drama series was shown on a major US network in prime time since Encounter, a short-lived ABC anthology series broadcast live out of the CBC's Toronto studios in the fall of 1958. In late 1988, CBS announced it had officially canceled Night Heat. In spite of the show's popularity, CBS decided that it could get even better ratings in the late-night timeslot with The Pat Sajak Show, a talk show fronted by Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak. Over a fourth of CBS's affiliates expressed more interest in running the Sajak program than continuing to run Night Heat and the last episode aired on CBS in January 1989 even though CTV still had a full season on film that had yet to be aired. After the series was canceled, reruns continued to air on CBS for another two years, and on Canadian television well into the early 2000s. ReceptionRatings= Night Heat received good ratings for CBS; the show drew an average of 20% of TV viewers in its timeslot and at times the show even outperformed NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in such markets as New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago. In Canada Night Heat attracted a million viewers a week. Critics in Canada were generally enthusiastic about Night Heat and were proud of the fact that it was being shown on American television. Critics such as Rick Salutin of The Globe and Mail expressed disappointment that the show hid or downplayed the fact that it was Canadian in order to appeal to US audiences: \\"they never say it's Toronto. It's just the city.\\" =Accolades= Night Heat won the award for Best Drama Series at the 1986 Gemini Awards. At the 1987 Gemini Awards the series again won the award for Best Drama Series, actor Eugene Clark won the award for Best Performance by a Supporting Actor and writer Bob Carney won the award for Best Writing in a Dramatic Series for the episode titled \\"The Hit\\". Night Heat also won the 1987 Gemini award in the category of TV Guide's Most Popular Program, an award based on ballots submitted by the magazine's readers in Canada. At the 1988 Gemini Awards writers Tim Dunphy and Peter Mohan won the award for Best Writing in a Dramatic Series and Night Heat again won TV Guide's Most Popular Program award. In 1989 the series writer Chris Haddock won the Gemini Award for Best Writing in a Dramatic Series for the episode titled \\"False Witness\\".

In 2017–18, Mission Australia employed approximately 2800 staff and 1750 volunteers, and supported more than 119,000 children, young people, adults and elderly people across 461 programs and services. The organisation specialises in the areas of homelessness and housing, families and children, early learning, youth, employment and skills, alcohol and other drugs, disability, mental health, and strengthening communities. James Toomey became CEO in November 2017, succeeding Catherine Yeomans, who served as CEO from March 2014. History Mission Australia traces its origins back to 1859 to the Brisbane Town and Country Mission, which operated at a grassroots level to respond to need within the community. At this time in Australian history the needs were great, with many people struggling to stay fed, clothed and housed. On 11 July 1862, Englishman Benjamin Short established the Sydney City Mission, desiring to address the spiritual and physical needs of the city’s inhabitants who were living in poverty. In a public meeting, Short presented his vision for Sydney City Mission: “Christian friends, we have called you together because we desire to submit for your serious consideration the question, ‘Is it not desirable that there be established in Sydney a City Mission, somewhat similar in character to the London City Mission?’ … We feel that something must be done, and that the Christian Churches of Sydney cannot be held guiltless if they neglect to stretch out a helping hand to rescue those who are perishing around them.” Benjamin ShortShort gained the support of many prominent citizens, including the likes of John Fairfax, and clergymen of almost every denomination. The motto ‘Need, Not Creed’ emerged, with those present agreeing that a city as diverse as Sydney required a non-denominational City Mission. Four missionaries were appointed in 1862 (two men and two women), with their main tasks including home visits, distributing Bibles, persuading alcoholics to turn sober, and encouraging parents to send their children to school and Sunday School. Adelaide City Mission followed soon after in 1867 with a similar goal of addressing spiritual and physical need among the poor and disadvantaged in the city. For decades these and other missions met immediate needs, giving out food and clothing. As no government welfare or unemployment benefits existed, City Missions saved many families from starvation. During the recession of 1890 and the Great Depression of the 1930s, Mission halls overflowed with people in need. By the middle of the 20th century, the City Missions recognised the importance of finding long-term solutions to disadvantage. In 1974 Perth City Mission, then known as Jesus People Welfare Services, was founded. In 1989 Wollongong City Mission and Wagga Wagga City Mission were founded. In 1991, Hunter Mission was established, building on community service programs provided by Mayfield Baptist Church. In 1996, Mission Australia officially formed, bringing together Adelaide City Mission, Hunter Mission, Perth City Mission, Sydney City Mission, Wagga Wagga City Mission and Wollongong City Mission. Brisbane City Mission joined soon after in 1998. In 2000, Mission Australia’s Northern Territory and Tasmania state offices opened, followed by Victoria in 2002. In 2008, Mission Australia Housing was established, and was joined the following year by Mission Australia Early Learning. The following lists names of organisations that have merged and amalgamated over time to form Mission Australia: * Adelaide City Mission, later known as Mission SA * Canberra City Mission * Hunter Mission * Jesus People Welfare Services, later known as Perth City Mission * Mission Australia Group Training and Mission Employment * Mission Australia Limited * Mission Australia Southern NSW * NSW Country Services * Sydney City Mission * Town and Country Mission, later known as Brisbane City Mission * Wagga Wagga City Mission * Wollongong City Mission  Goal, purpose and values  Mission Australia has an organisational goal: To reduce homelessness and strengthen communities across Australia. Its purpose – the guiding principle upon which the Mission was founded – is stated as: Inspired by Jesus Christ, Mission Australia exists to meet human need and to spread the knowledge of the love of God. Mission Australia lists its core values as Compassion, Integrity, Respect, Perseverance and Celebration.

Signs and symptoms The condition manifests as an allergic-like reaction, causing a warm red wheal to appear on the skin. As it is often the result of scratches, involving contact with other materials, it can be confused with an allergic reaction, when in fact it is the act of being scratched that causes a wheal to appear. These wheals are a subset of urticaria (hives), and appear within minutes, in some cases accompanied by itching. The first outbreak of urticaria can lead to other reactions on body parts not directly stimulated, scraped, or scratched. In a normal case, the swelling will decrease without treatment within 15–30 minutes, but, in extreme cases, itchy red welts may last anywhere from a few hours to days. Causes Symptoms are thought to be the result of histamine being released by mast cells on the surface of the skin. Due to the lack of antigens, histamine causes the skin to swell in affected areas. If the membrane that surrounds the mast cells is too weak it will easily and rapidly break down under physical pressure, which then causes an allergic-like reaction. Symptoms can be caused or induced by: * stress * tight or abrasive clothing * watches * glasses * heat * cold * pressure on exposed skin * infection * diet * air currents : air flow moving hairs on skin surface The underlying cause of dermographism is not known, and it can last for many years without relief. The condition may subside and be effectively cured; however, it is often a lifelong ailment. It is not a life-threatening disease, and it is not contagious. Dermographism may occur in mastocytosis (systemic mast cell proliferation). Diagnosis This condition is diagnosed by a health care provider writing or drawing on the patient's skin with a tongue depressor or other implement, to see whether a red wheal appears soon afterwards. Treatment Dermographism can be treated by substances which prevent histamine from causing the reaction (i.e. an antihistamine). These may need to be given as a combination of H1 antagonists, or possibly with an H2-receptor antagonist such as cimetidine. Over-the-counter vitamin C, 1000 mg daily, increases histamine degradation and removal. Refraining from taking hot baths or showers may help if the condition is generalized (i.e. all over), as well as possibly for localized cases (i.e. in a specific area). If taking hot showers helps, it may be a condition called shower eczema. If it affects mainly the head, it may be psoriasis. In rare cases, allergy tests may uncover substances the patient is allergic to. While cromoglycate, which prevents histamine from being released from mast cells, is used topically in rhinitis and asthma, it is not effective orally for treating chronic urticaria.

Between 1994 and 1998 she was the political secretary of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Water. Between 1998 and 2002 she served as Deputy Speaker of the Hungarian National Assembly. She was the candidate of the Hungarian Socialist Party for presidency in the 2005 Hungarian presidential elections. Szili lost the election on 7 June 2005 to opposition nominee László Sólyom. The Hungarian Constitution prescribes that the President must be elected by the National Assembly of Hungary, thus the victory of the opposition came as something of a surprise. The junior coalition party, the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), however, had long emphasized that it would not vote for a partisan President. Szili as a high-ranking member of the Socialist party was considered partisan, the SZDSZ abstained, enabling the more neutral candidate Sólyom (who was originally nominated by a non-governmental organization Védegylet and later supported by the opposition), to win the office. Another reason for the failed nomination was that SZDSZ was not consulted ahead of time and Szili lacked qualifications compared to Sólyom who previously held high office as the president of the Constitutional Court of Hungary. In 2009 Szili was the mayoral candidate of MSZP for the mayor of a major Hungarian city, Pécs.

An interim report was released on June 29, 2014, followed by roundtables with 175 key stakeholders in all states and territories, consultations with 55 people on income support, 271 formal submissions and 231 online comments. The final report titled “A New System for Better Employment and Social Outcomes” was launched in Canberra on 23 February 2015 by Patrick McClure and the Minister for Social Services Scott Morrison. It proposed an integrated approach across four pillars of reform with an employment focus: a simpler and more sustainable income support system, building individual and family capacity, engaging employers, and building community capacity. Key recommendations included: reducing the current complex and inefficient system of 20 payments and 55 supplements to five payments and four categories of supplements; a passport to work, enabling people to move easily between employment and the income support system; a new ICT system to drive efficiencies in the new income support system; an investment approach with early intervention services focusing on groups most at risk of long term welfare dependence; a jobs plan for people with disabilities and mental health conditions; and the use of social impact bonds to attract private investment to address social problems. Since the 2015 budget, the Australian government has allocated funds for a new ICT system, a prerequisite for introducing a simpler income support system; the Priority Investment Approach contracting PwC to complete annual actuarial valuations of groups at risk of lifetime welfare dependence; allocations to organisations from the $100m Try, Test and Learn Fund; simplification of child and youth payments; support for social impact investment in affordable housing; and a new JobSeeker Payment to replace or consolidate seven existing payments.

Hypothetic map of the ruins at Pessinus by the French explorer Charles Texier (1834). Pessinus, the present modern Turkish village of Ballıhisar, is centred 13 km from Sivrihisar a small town on the Ankara- Eskişehir road at the junction with the Afyon-İzmir road, 120 km southwest of Ankara. The village is on the high Anatolian plateau at 950 m above sea level. Its clustered centre is in a tributary valley of the Sakarya.  History  The mythological King Midas (738-696 BC?) is said to have ruled a greater Phrygian realm from Pessinus, but archaeological research since 1967 showed that the city developed around 400 BC at the earliest, which contradicts any historical claim of early Phrygian roots. According to ancient tradition, Pessinous was the principal cult centre of the cult of Cybele/Kybele. The Graeco-Phrygian Cybele is rooted in the old Anatolian goddess Kubaba, whose cult spread over Anatolia during the second millennium BC. Tradition situates the cult of Cybele in the early Phrygian period (8th century BC) and associates the erection of her first \\"costly\\" temple and even the founding of the city with king Midas (738-696 BC?). However, the Phrygian past of Pessinus is still obscure, both historically as archaeologically. For example, the geographer Strabo (12.5.3) writes that the priests were potentates in \\"ancient times\\", but it is unclear whether Pessinus was already a temple state ruled by \\"dynastai\\" in the Phrygian period. According to Cicero (Har. Resp. 8.28) the Seleucid kings held deep devotion for the shrine, which indicates the sanctuary was still much revered in this period. By the 3rd century BC at the latest, Pessinus had become a temple state ruled by a clerical oligarchy consisting of Galloi, eunuch priests of the Mother Goddess. After the arrival of Celtic tribes in Asia Minor in 278/277 BC, and their defeat at the hand of Antiochus I during the so-called 'Battle of the Elephants' (likely 268 BC), the Celts settled in the north-central region of Anatolia which became known as Galatia. The tribe of the Tolistobogii occupied the Phrygian territory between Gordium and Pessinus. It is doubtful that the temple state actually stood under Galatian control at this early stage. Roman involvement in Pessinus however has early roots. In 205/204 BC, alarmed by a number of meteor showers during the ongoing Second Punic War, the Romans, after consulting the Sibylline Books, decided to introduce the cult of the Great Mother of Ida (Magna Mater Idaea, also known as Cybele) to the city. They sought the aid of their ally Attalus I (241-197 BC), and following his instructions, they went to Pessinus and removed the goddess' most important image, a large black stone that was said to have fallen from the sky, to Rome (Livy 10.4-11.18). Pergamum seems to have gained some control over Pessinus by the end of the third century BC. Pessinus was bequeathed a sanctuary by the Attalid kings, perhaps after 183 BC, when Galatia was subject to Pergamene rule. The first century BC was a very unstable period for Pessinus with many rulers reigning over central Anatolia. According to Strabo (12.5.3) the priests gradually lost their privileges. The Mithridatic Wars (89-85 BC; 83-81 BC; 73-63 BC) caused political and economic turmoil throughout the region. When Deiotaros, tetrarch of the Tolistobogii and loyal vassal of Rome, became king of Galatia in 67/66 BC or 63 BC, Pessinus lost its status as an independent sacred principality. In 36 BC, rule over Galatia was transferred to king Amyntas by Marc Anthony. At the death of the monarch, under Emperor Augustus the empire of the Galatians was annexed by the Imperium Romanum as the province of Galatia. Pessinus became the administrative capital of the Galatian tribe of the Tolistobogii and soon developed into a genuinely Graeco-Roman polis with a large number of monumental buildings, such as a colonnaded street and a Temple of the Imperial Cult. The priest list on the left hand anta of the temple of Augustus and Roma in Ankara reveals that by the end of Tiberius' principate two citizens of Pessinus held the chief priesthood of the provincial imperial cult in Ancyra: M. Lollius in AD 31/32 and Q. Gallius Pulcher in AD 35/36. Strabo called Pessinus an 'emporion,' a trading centre, the largest west of the Halys river. It may be assumed that products from the Anatolian highlands were traded, especially grain and wool. A stamped handle of a wine amphora from Thasos, probably dating from the first quarter of the 3rd century BC, is proof of this trade and is at the same time the earliest written document discovered at Pessinus. Very soon after 25 BC the urbanization and transformation of the Pessinuntian temple state into a Greek polis began. Constructions such as a Corinthian temple and a colonnaded street (cardo maximus) were erected with the marble from the quarries located at İstiklalbağı, ca. 6 km north of the city. The boundaries of Pessinus must have been fixed, as were those of the newly founded colony of Germakoloneia (near Babadat), which received part of the area inhabited by the Tolistobogioi. It has been argued that Pessinous and the other Galatian cities received a constitution based on that of the cities in Pontus-Bithynia, imposed by the lex Pompeia.3D visualisation of the Corinthian peripteros at Pessinus (by A. Verlinde). From the inscriptions it appears that Pessinus possessed several public buildings, including a gymnasium, a theatre, an archive, and baths. A system of water supply has been discovered through gutters and terracotta pipes. The most impressive public construction of the early Imperial period was the canalisation system,Waelkens, M. 1984, Le système d'endiguement du torrent, in Devreker, J. and Waelkens, M., Les fouilles de la Rijksuniversiteit te Gent à Pessinonte 1967-1973, 77-141. the earliest part of which dates from the Augustan age. It was meant to retain and carry away the waters of the Gallos, the seasonal river which traverses Pessinus and which was the main north-south artery (cardo maximus) of the city. From the 1st to the 3rd century AD the canal was continuously expanded until it finally reached a length of ca. 500 m and a width of 11 to 13 m. It is not known when exactly the large theatre, of which is preserved only the emplacement of the cavea where the spectators were seated, was constructed, but it was repaired or embellished by Hadrian. Other monumental buildings, erected under the reign of Tiberius, included the marble peripteros temple of the provincial Imperial cult, a Sebasteion, on a hill at the north-western end of the canal, a stairway combined with a theatre in front (with an orchestra where religious and other performances such as gladiator fights took place). The colonnaded square lower down the valley was reconstructed by Verlinde.Verlinde 2010, op. cit. In the past,Waelkens, M. 1986, The Imperial Sanctuary at Pessinus: Epigraphical and Numismatic Evidence for its Date and Identification, EpigAnat 7, 37-72. this structure was wrongly situated in the Tiberian era, but it was shown that it was a monument of the Hellenistic age (late 2nd-early 1st century BC), and contemporary with the citadel that preceded the temple complex.Verlinde, A. 2010, Monumental Architecture in Hellenistic and Julio- Claudian Pessinus, Babesch 85, 111-139. Christianity reached the area in the 3rd century, and at the end of the 4th century, the temple of Augustus was decommissioned.Verlinde 2012, op. cit. Perhaps as a sign of the rise of Christianity in Pessinus, Emperor Julian the Apostate made a pilgrimage to Pessinus and wrote an angry letter concerning the disrespect shown to the sanctuary of Cybele. In ca. 398, Pessinus was established as the capital of the newly established province of Galatia Salutaris (in the civil Diocese of Pontus), and became the seat of a Metropolitan Archbishop. The region later became part of the Byzantine Anatolic Theme. In late 715 AD, the city of Pessinus was destroyed by an Arab raid, along with the neighboring city Orkistos. The area remained under Byzantine control until lost to the Seljuk Turks in the latter 11th century, after which Pessinus became an inconspicuous mountain village at 900m height, gradually getting depopulated since it was fully protected.  Ecclesiastical history  Circa AD 398, Pessinus was established as the capital of the newly established Roman province of Galatia Salutaris (=Secunda), and became the seat of a Metropolitan Archdiocese, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Despite the Arab sack of the city in the 7th century, it has Archbishops at least until the 11th century, but ultimately was suppressed, being truly in partibus infidelium under Turkish (Seljuk, later Ottoman) Muslim rule. It would be nominally revived in the early 20th century, both in a Latin (extant) and in an Armenian Catholic (short-lived) line of apostolic succession. = Ecclesiastical province = * The Notitia Episcopatuum of pseudo-Epifanius, edited under Byzantine emperor Heraclius I (circa 640), the see ranks 18th amongst the Metropolitans in the Patriarchate of Constantinople and has seven suffragans : Amorium, Claneus (has been made a titular bishopric), Eudoxias (a titular bishopric), Petinessus (a titular bishopric), Trocmades (also titular bishopric; nicknamed (P)lotinus after its patron saint], not the philosopher, 'Germocolonia' (i.e. Germa in Galatia) and 'Palia' (sic; cfr.

Archeology  The archaeological research by Ghent University (1967–1973 under the directorship of Pieter Lambrechts; 1987–2008 under the directorship of John Devreker) of the temple area, which was discovered in 1834 by the French architect and archaeologist Charles Texier in the south of the village along the Gallos river, Angelo Verlinde's 2012 PhD dissertation, published in 2015, adds to the understanding of the temple area.Verlinde, A. 2015, The Roman sanctuary site at Pessinus: from Phrygian to Byzantine times (Leuven, Peeters: 2015). As yet, the temple area (sector B) is the only thoroughly investigated area of the city, with the exception of the so-called Acropolis (sector I) near the northern entrance of the Ballıhisar valley.Devreker, J., Thoen, H. and Vermeulen, F. 2003, Excavations in Pessinus: the so-called acropolis. From Hellenistic and Roman cemetery to Byzantine castle, Ghent. Since 2009, the city is being investigated by a team of the University of Melbourne, Australia, led by Gocha Tsetskhladze.  Remains  The temple area = As yet, the temple area, which was excavated between 1967 and 1972, is the only well-studied area of Pessinus. It was studied thoroughly by M. Waelkens (current director of Sagalassos excavations) in the 1980s and between 2006 and 2012 by Verlinde (Ghent University), who built on the findings of the former to analyze and reconstruct the architecture of the Corinthian peripteral temple, of which only the massive foundations remain.Verlinde, A. 2012, The Temple Complex of Pessinus. Archaeological Research on the Function, Morphology and Chronology of a Sanctuary in Asia Minor (unpublished PhD thesis, Ghent University). This dissertation is in the process of being published as a monograph (forthcoming, 2013: Monographs of Antiquity). Investigations led to several observations, such as the Tiberian date (25-35 AD) of the cult building and its identification as a temple of the imperial cult (Sebasteion). As such, it was finally established that the excavated temple could not be identified as the Temple of Cybele, as explorer Charles Texier had done when he 'discovered' the foundations of the temple in 1834.Texier, C. 1839, Description de l'Asie Mineure faite par ordre du gouvernement français de 1833 à 1837: Beaux-arts, monuments historiques, plans et topographie des cités antiques I, Paris. Verlinde discovered that the building was designed on the basis of a grid, and that the governing module, determining the intervals and height of the columns, was equal to the lower diameter of the columns (0.76 m). Each intercolumnar space was equal to two modules (1.52 m), which designates the temple as a 'systyle.' Furthermore, the extraordinarily large stepped podium seems to have been influenced by Hellenistic and early Imperial pseudodipteroi. Although the temple was Tiberian, the decorative sculpture was fashioned in a conservative Augustan manner, which suggests that the building may have been design in the late Augustan period (ca. 15 AD). The temple towered over the back of a theatre, which combined a central staircase with two cavea wings for spectators. It was claimed by Verlinde that this theatrical area was ritual and used for gladiatorial fights, as the theatre contained raised seats with a protective parapet, which was typical for gladiatorial theatres in the Greek east. Given that such gladiatorial combat was as a rule intertwined with the imperial cult, Verlinde argued that the epigraphically attested cult of the emperor, was once again confirmed. He also observed that there is a consistency of such theatre-temples, which were influenced by late Republican sanctuaries in Italy (e.g. the sanctuary of Hercules Victor at Tivoli), being associated with the imperial cult. The sanctuary of Augustus at Stratonicea,Mert, I.H. 2008, Untersuchungen zur hellenistischen und kaiserzeitlichen Bauornamentik von Stratonikea, Tübingen. which was a theatre-templeHanson, J.A. 1959, Roman Theater-Temples, Princeton, N.J. as well, may have served as a model for the sanctuary in Pessinus. View of the temple area from the mosque at Ballıhisar (photograph and panoramic montage by A. Verlinde). = The colonnaded square = The colonnaded square in front of the stairway-theatre was thought to have been part of the imperial complex. However, this was rejected by Verlinde who dated the complex to the late 2nd century BC.Verlinde, A. 2010, op. cit. The architecture of the limestone complex (covered with stucco lustro) emanates the style of Hellenistic palaestrae such as the Gymnasion of Eudemos at Miletus (late 3rd century BC). Being quite similar to the latter complex, the Pessinuntian square was reconstructed by Verlinde as a 'quadriporticus' with a Rhodian peristyle, that is with a high (Ionic) colonnade to the north, and three lower wings with Doric columns. The quadriporticus was an annex of the Hellenistic citadel on the promontory to the east, which preceded the early imperial temple. Eastern stoa of the colonnaded square or quadriporticus at Pessinus (Photograph by A. Verlinde). The combination of a Hellenistic palace and a gymnasium (school) was a typical phenomenon of the Greek world during the Hellenistic age. Carbondating and ceramological analysis indicates that the palaestra (sports gym) was destroyed by a fire during the late Hellenistic age, suggesting that the colonnaded square as a functional entity was short- lived. After the quadriporticus was destroyed, it was not rebuilt during the early Roman period, as the area may have been used as an unpaved arena for the gladiatorial fights of the temple. In the 3rd century AD, the area was monumentalized with a new ellipse-shaped theatre and a vast marble square with a monumental funerary crypt (a funerary Heroon). This coincided with the further monumentalization of the cardo maximus, which received monumental city gates in the form of arches at its southern and northern extremity.

Both teams were undefeated at the time. Born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, Varney attended North Quincy High School and Deerfield Academy before enrolling at Harvard, where he played varsity football as well as baseball. In the 85th Harvard–Yale game on November 23, 1968, tight end Varney caught Frank Champi's pass for the two-point conversion in the final second to earn a tie, and a share of the Ivy League championship, with Yale. Although the famous game ended deadlocked, the furious comeback caused The Harvard Crimson to headline its game story, Harvard Beats Yale 29-29. A standout in baseball, Varney batted .370 over his three varsity seasons, still the third-highest batting average in Crimson baseball history, and was selected a first-team All-American.Brandeis University After being drafted six previous times by five different Major League Baseball teams, Varney signed with the Chicago White Sox after they selected him in the first round of the secondary phase of the 1971 Major League Baseball Draft following his graduation from Harvard.

He has a massive, stony body possessed of incredible strength and endurance. Publication history Blok appeared in Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #253 (July, 1979) by Gerry Conway and Joe Staton in an era referred to as the Bronze Age of Comic Books. Fictional character biography Blok first appeared as a member of the League of Super-Assassins, where he was manipulated by the Dark Man, a clone of Tharok, into attacking the Legion of Super-Heroes.Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #253. DC Comics, July, 1979. Blok, possibly the last of a silicon-based species native to the planet Dryad, had been convinced by Tharok that the Legion was seeking to destroy his home world, when in fact the Legionnaires were working to save it. When he learned that the Legionnaires were not his enemies, he turned on the Assassins and eventually joined the Legion.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 2) #272. DC Comics, February, 1981. He knew very little of the rest of his race; it was not even clear to him whether his form was that of an adult or a child. Blok was relatively slow to acclimate to life in the Legion, though he eventually forged a close bond with two of his teammates, Timber Wolf and the White Witch, the latter with whom he spent a great deal of leisure time perusing the Legion's voluminous archives. He remained with the team for several years, eventually choosing to leave following the catastrophic Black Dawn affair and the increased scrutiny and suspicion of Earthgov towards all Legion activities. He eventually found his way to the Puppet Planetoid, where he spent a few years in isolated contemplation. Shortly thereafter Polar Boy officially disbanded the Legion of Super-Heroes. In 2994, Blok's former teammates Rokk Krinn and Reep Daggle began to reorganize the team, a move which immediately attracted the attention of the corrupt Earthgov. In order to discourage and demoralize the new effort, the alien Dominators who had been secretly controlling Earthgov for years hired Roxxas to seek out and kill Blok as a warning to his other teammates. Roxxas tracked Blok down to the Puppet Planetoid and carried out his mission with ruthless efficiency, delivering Blok's dismembered corpse to the ranch home of Garth and Imra Ranzz on Winath.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #3. DC Comics, January, 1990. Far from demoralizing the other Legionnaires, however, Roxxas's act galvanized them into action, and it was directly following their discovery of Blok's murder that the Legion of Super-Heroes was officially refounded. At the moment of his death fighting Roxxas, Blok seemed to have an out-of-body experience in which he was back on Dryad, and met Strata of L.E.G.I.O.N., who he recognized from mythology. Strata promised to finally show him the truth of his ancestral history as she led him below ground into a series of caves. Filled with joy, the gentle, philosophical Blok's last thoughts were of finally reaching enlightenment. =Post-Zero Hour= Blok did not appear in the post-Zero Hour Legion. A female Dryadian named Brika was introduced in Legionnaires #71 (May 1999), protesting a group of colonists who intend to re-settle her hibernating clan. She was then possessed by a stone elemental named Rrox, who destroyed the planet, thinking \\"No-one will ever colonize Dryad now\\". Blok appears briefly (with several other Legionnaires from previous iterations of the team such as Tyroc and Dawnstar) as a character in a 'campfire story' showing the Legion's influence, and the urban legends and myths that have sprung up around it.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 5) #15. DC Comics, April, 2006. This appearance was a cameo, and does not appear to take place in the series actual continuity. =Post-Infinite Crisis= Blok, along with many other pre-Crisis Legionnaires, appears as a statue in Superman's Fortress of Solitude.Justice Society of America (vol. 2) #5. DC Comics, June, 2007. He also appears as a member of the Legion in the \\"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\\" storyline. In Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #2, Blok rescues Mysa from Mordru on Zerox, being aided in the rescue by Dawnstar, Wildfire, and Rond Vidar. It is revealed at this point that Blok and Mysa are in a relationship, one that was only briefly hinted at as Blok's unrequited crush in the pre- Crisis Legion. Blok helped combat the Legion of Super-Villains until he suffered major injuries at the hand of Mordru. To save him, Mysa absorbs Mordru's magicks, becoming the Black Witch, and leaves the Legion for the Sorcerer's World when the battle is over. Once his wounds are healed, Blok follows Mysa, and convinces her to let him help her use Mordru's black magic for good. In the \\"Watchmen\\" sequel \\"Doomsday Clock\\", Blok is among the Legion of Super-Heroes members that appear in the present after Doctor Manhattan undid the experiment that erased the Legion of Super-Heroes and the Justice Society of America.Doomsday Clock #12 (December 2019). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Blok's abilities fluctuated during his career. Though his enormous size and rocky form suggested super-human strength and near-invulnerability, he did not demonstrate such abilities during his first appearance. Rather, he seemed able to absorb various sorts of energy attacks, being specifically immune to Light Lass's anti-gravity powers. In his second appearance, this was specifically stated to be an ability to increase his own mass. This power seemed not entirely under his control; when he joined the Legion, it was stated that three Legion flight-rings were required to lift him. Why his teammate Colossal Boy (who could also increase his mass and size) could make do with a single flight ring, but Blok could not, was never explained. During Blok's Legion tenure, it was stated definitely that he had massive super-human strength. Its relative limits were never made clear; it was stated that he could not match the levels of pre-Crisis Kryptonians and Daxamites or Ultra Boy, but seemed stronger than Timber Wolf and, possibly, Colossal Boy. Contrary to this, his durability was greater than that of the latter two heroes, though still not quite on Kryptonian levels. This may have been contradicted when he was able to hold his own against pre-Crisis Daxamites hand-to-hand during a Darkseid led invasion of the United Planets during the Great Darkness Saga in Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 2) #294. His recuperative abilities were likewise vague. In his earliest experiences, his body included a collar-like formation around his neck which was destroyed during the Great Darkness Saga and never regrew, but he seemed unharmed by its lack. A formation on his face that resembled a nose was likewise apparently chipped away. Blok was also written as having the ability to communicate telepathically with other silicon-based life forms. Despite his searching, he never did find any, so this ability went unexplored. Over time, his earlier abilities to change his mass and absorb energy were de-emphasized in favor of his super-strength. Towards the end of his life he began to mutate into a different form, larger than before and possessed of several protuberances which expelled energetic plasma from time to time. It was speculated that Blok's earlier form had been an immature, possibly larval state, and the changes in his body were actually a metamorphosis like that of a butterfly. Another supposition was that he was reaching maturity and beginning to show signs of that race's indication that he was male. A 20th century Dryadian, Strata of L.E.G.I.O.N., metamorphosed into a diamond-like version. When asked about the metamorphosis, she replied: \\"I guess that means I'm female\\". Equipment As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes he is provided a Legion Flight Ring. It allows him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments. His ring was modified to handle the increased mass of Blok as he originally has to wear three rings due to his massive size. In other media * Blok appeared in an episode of Justice League Unlimited titled \\"Far From Home\\". He and the rest of the Legion of Super-Heroes were mind-controlled by the Fatal Five to attack the United Planets. * Blok has appeared four times in the Legion of Super Heroes animated series in small cameos or crowd scenes in which he has no lines. The cancelled third season of the series would have given him a more major role. Reception Jesse Murray of Syfy placed Blok as the 33rd greatest Legion of Super-Heroes member of all time describing him as \\"once a misguided bad guy who saw the light\\". Producer of Batman: The Brave and the Bold, James Tucker cited the character as a favorite Legion of Superheroes character of his.

Although the title hymn does not appear on the album (Spiritualized have covered it previously, and released a free-jazz version as a b-side in 2001, and also on Complete Works Vol. 2), the ballad \\"Hold On\\" is based upon the same melody, and the opening track \\"This Little Life Of Mine\\" is clearly indebted to the spiritual \\"This Little Light Of Mine\\". After working with free-jazz collective Spring Heel Jack on one of their albums and tour, frontman Jason Pierce was inspired to make a record with the same principles. His approach meant that the rest of Spiritualized was given the songs on the same day as they were recorded, meaning the record (including orchestral overdubs) was completed in 3 weeks. This is a huge difference compared to its predecessor, Let It Come Down, which took four years to record. The album is generally harder-edged than its predecessors, featuring a number of variations on the familiar Spiritualized \\"Electricity\\" garage-rock riff. Conversely, \\"The Ballad of Richie Lee\\" is a tender, organ-driven tribute to the lead singer of the American group Acetone, a friend of Pierce, who committed suicide in 2001. The song was used in the final scene of the film The Unloved, whose director, actress Samantha Morton, is a close friend of Pierce's. Two singles were released, \\"She Kissed Me (It Felt Like a Hit)\\" and \\"Cheapster.\\" The former song's title is a reference to the song \\"He Hit Me (It Felt Like A Kiss)\\" by the 1960s girl group The Crystals, and the latter's is a likely reference to T. Rex's \\"Jeepster.\\" The world tour following the album's release culminated in a headline slot on The Other Stage at Glastonbury 2004 and a support slot for Primal Scream at Brixton Academy, for the Hoping Foundation charity concert, later released on DVD. The closing track on the album, \\"Lay It Down Slow\\", was used in the Series Finale of the American TV show Prison Break. Track listing All songs written by J Spaceman.

His towering 6 ft 5 in (196 cm) presence and intimidating face usually got him roles playing tough guys, thugs, strong men, and gangsters. Early years Mazurki was born Markiyan (Mykhailo) Mazurkevych () () in the village of Kupchyntsi (in present-day Kozova Raion), near what was then Tarnopol, Galicia, Austria- Hungary (now Ternopil, Ukraine). He was from an ethnic Ukrainian family. In 1913, he emigrated with his family to the United States living in Cohoes, New York, just outside Albany, in old mill housing on Olmstead Street with his mother. Mazurki attended LaSalle Institute in Troy, for high school. Upon finishing school, he changed his name to \\"Mike\\". He played football and basketball at Manhattan College, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1930. After earning his bachelor's degree, Mazurki graduated from Fordham Law School and became an attorney. He later said he took up professional wrestling because he could earn around ten times what he could as a lawyer. Mazurki was also a professional American football and basketball player.  Career  Mazurki was discovered by Josef von Sternberg and given a bit part in his film The Shanghai Gesture (1941). This led to a long film and television career. Possibly his most memorable role was that of slow-witted thug Moose Malloy in the film noir Murder, My Sweet (1944), opposite Dick Powell. He portrayed the psychotic, knife-wielding murderer Splitface in the original Dick Tracy (1945). He played a wrestler nicknamed \\"The Strangler\\" in Night and the City (1950) and a role imitating the manner of a George Raft henchman in the Billy Wilder comedy, Some Like It Hot (1959). He continued to wrestle during his acting career. His slurred speech was reportedly due to a wrestling injury to his Adam's apple. in addition to his film work, Mazurki made guest appearances on many popular television shows, among them My Friend Flicka (as a wrestler facing Gene Evans's character of Rob McLaughlin), The Untouchables, Bachelor Father, Daniel Boone, Gilligan's Island, The Munsters, I Dream of Jeannie, Bonanza, and Gunsmoke, to name just a few. In 1964 he played Cully Barstow, a yacht hand, in \\"The Case of the Missing Button\\", an episode of Perry Mason in which he threatened Mason and Paul Drake with a set of brass knuckles. He also played Arthur Jacks in the episode \\"The Case of the Deadly Verdict\\" (1963). He was a regular as well on the short-lived sitcom The Chicago Teddy Bears. Along with his film and television appearances, Mazurki was seen in the hit Rod Stewart music video \\"Infatuation\\", playing the bodyguard protecting a woman (played by Kay Lenz) from a stalker (played by Stewart). In the end, he succeeds, punching out Stewart. In 1966–67, he performed as the caveman \\"Clon\\" in It's About Time. In 1965, he co-founded and became the first president of the Cauliflower Alley Club, an association of professional wrestlers. A photograph of his cauliflower ear forms the logo of the organization. He was posthumously awarded the New York State Award in 2005 by the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum for founding the club. In 1975, he landed his only starring role in a film as Trapper in Challenge to be Free. The movie went largely unnoticed, but Mazurki drew praise for his convincing performance as a solitary-minded, nature-loving wilderness man wrongly accused of manslaughter. As he aged, acting opportunities for Mazurki began to slow in the 1970s and 1980s; nevertheless, he continued working until his death on December 9, 1990. His final film role, that of \\"Don Taglianeti\\", is in the low-budget comedy Mob Boss, which was released just two months before he died.

It was released on April 7, 1998, through Polyvinyl Record Co. After the release of the band's second studio album, The Age of Octeen (1996), drummer Damon Atkinson replaced Roy Ewing due to him being unable to commit to touring. Recording sessions took place at Inner Ear Studios in December 1997, with J. Robbins helping with production during the sessions. The album is an emo and post-hardcore release, for which the lyrics were co-written by vocalist/guitarists Chris Broach and Bob Nanna, or solely wrote by Nanna. Preceded by a European tour with the Get Up Kids, Frame & Canvas was promoted by Braid with tours across the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan with the likes of Compound Red, Discount, and Burning Airlines. It had sold over 16,000 copies by July 2004. The album has appeared on best-of lists for the emo genre by multiple publications, such as Kerrang!, NME, and Rolling Stone. Braid performed the album in its entirety during a 2012 US tour. Background and production Following the release of their second studio album The Age of Octeen in 1996, Braid played shows in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Missouri in September and October. Between November 1996 and January 1997, the band toured the south and west coasts of the United States. Following a handful of shows in February 1997, drummer Roy Ewing left Braid the following month. He was replaced by Damon Atkinson of Figurehead; Atkinson had previously filled in for Ewing when he was unable to book time off work for a tour. Atkinson had been a fan of the band and Ewing's drumming; when he came to practice, they felt he was the perfect replacement. Braid's touring continued throughout 1997; they played with the likes of the Get Up Kids, Tomorrow, and Compound Red, among others. During this time, the band wrote material for their next album while attending college; vocalist/guitarist Chris Broach dropped out as they were becoming more active. The tracks \\"First Day Back\\" and \\"Hugs from Boys\\" were recorded in August 1997. Following on from this, Braid traveled across the US with Rainer Maria in October of that year. To coincide with the tour, they released the two songs on a 7\\" vinyl, through independent label Polyvinyl Record Co. The members used to skateboard with co-founder Matt Lunsford before they became a band; he and fellow co-founder Darcie Knight organized the band's first-ever show in 1993. The day vocalist/guitarist Bob Nanna graduated from college, Braid traveled to Washington, D.C., to record their next album. Frame & Canvas was recorded in December 1997 at Inner Ear Studios in Arlington County, Virginia, with J. Robbins and the band acting as producers. Braid had met Robbins twice before working on the album with him. They approached him because of his work on albums by the Promise Ring and Kerosene 454. Robbins served as the engineer for Frame & Canvas and also mixed the recordings. The recording and mixing process lasted six days, and each recording day lasted 13 hours. Composition and lyrics Musically, the sound of Frame & Canvas has been described as emo and post-hardcore, landing between the late 1990s Midwest emo and D.C. post-hardcore acts, such as Fugazi and Jawbox, the latter of which Robbins was a member of. All of the music was written by Braid; Nanna wrote lyrics for seven of the tracks, and co-wrote the other five with Broach. Broach came up with the title of Frame & Canvas, which is taken from \\"Killing a Camera\\". Nanna said the title referred to \\"some kind of art school thing\\". Broach has a bigger vocal role on the album than the band's previous releases; he explained this was because he was \\"sick of being pushed down in the mix\\". The opening track, \\"The New Nathan Detroits\\", begins with a math rock drum introduction by Atkinson. The song features Broach and Nanna discussing job prospects with their parents. \\"Never Will Come for Us\\" includes references to Braid being an underground act that did not get airplay, and playing shows at friends' house parties. \\"First Day Back\\" was written after arriving home from their late 1996/early 1997 tour, and is about settling in after being gone for a while. \\"Collect from Clark Kent\\" is an atypical Midwest emo track, which talks about breakdowns in communication and long-distance issues. \\"Milwaukee Sky Rocket\\" was initially titled \\"Sky Rocket\\", until Atkinson—who was from Milwaukee—joined the band. They were working on \\"A Dozen Roses\\" in Nanna's parents' basement when Atkinson began playing what he called \\"this cool beat\\". Nanna stated that \\"immediately once he started playing\\", he thought: \\"This is different.\\" Robbins added tambourine to the track. Discussing \\"Urbana's Too Dark\\", Borach said Urbana, Illinois, was where the members lived alongside \\"the art kids and music kids. The frats were in Champaign and the old guard\\", such as Hum and Poster Children. The track's title referred to a movement that called for more street lights in Urbana because of concern over sexual assaults. With \\"Consolation Prize Fighter\\", the members felt there was competition from other bands, especially from their friends' bands, to make great albums and songs. It was written along with \\"Urbana's Too Dark\\" in 1995. \\"Ariel\\" is about living under one roof with people in bands while wishing the music Braid were making in the basement was being made upstairs. Robbins played an extra drum kit on \\"Breathe In\\", which Broach was highly impressed by. According to Broach, the song is about \\"trying to be the best person\\". Nanna said to occupy himself on tour, he would write lyrics; the lyrics of \\"I Keep a Diary\\" were used verbatim from a journal entry. Release and promotion Between January and March of 1998, the band went on a tour of Europe with the Get Up Kids. Frame & Canvas was released on April 7 of that year, through Polyvinyl. It was promoted by performing across the US with Compound Red until early May 1998. Braid immediately went back on tour with the Get Up Kids throughout that month, while they were accompanied various acts in June 1998. In August of that year, the band played one show in their home state, before embarking on a Canadian tour with Discount. Following on from this, they embarked on an East Coast tour in October and early November of 1998. Throughout the rest of November and the following month, Braid toured across Europe with Robbins' band Burning Airlines. After a number of northeastern US shows, the band embarked on a west coast tour with Seaweed and 365 Days of Pure Movie Magic in March 1999. They went on a cross-country tour throughout the following month with Kind of Like Spitting, before embarking on a Japanese tour with Eversor in May 1999. In June of that year, Braid announced they would be breaking up due to \\"internal stress\\". It was later revealed that Broach wanted to return to school and had little interest in the band by this point. Aside from performing at friend's wedding, the band played their last few shows in August 1999, including a hometown performance, which was later released as their live album Lucky to Be Alive (2000). Footage from Braid's last five days as a band was included in their documentary film Killing a Camera (2001). Reception and legacy AllMusic reviewer Blake Butler noted the band came up with \\"very technical pop melodies\\" on Frame & Canvas, accompanied by frequent time signature changes. He liked the \\"beautiful interlocking\\" guitar lines, which he wrote were \\"fused together with yelled/sung boyish vocals\\" from Broach and Nanna. In the opinion of Blake, the album cemented itself as one of Braid's best works. Blake even went as far as to say that by the end of the first track \\"you know you will be humming these melodies in your head for at least the next few days\\". LAS Magazine founder Eric J. Herboth said the album was \\"the record that is going to blow things wide open for Braid\\". He added that the band found an \\"equally amazing drummer\\" in Atkinson, alongside a \\"candy coated plush sound\\" and a \\"new best friend\\" with Robbins. As of July 2004, Frame & Canvas has sold over 16,000 copies worldwide. It has appeared on various best-of emo album lists, being named to lists by Consequence of Sound, Kerrang!, LA Weekly, NME, and Rolling Stone. Similarly, \\"A Dozen Roses\\" appeared on a best-of emo songs list by Vulture. OC Weekly said the album established Polyvinyl and pushed the band as an important figure in the emo scene. Frame & Canvas was an important snapshot of second-wave emo and the indie rock scene, the latter of which was based in Champagin, Illinois, during the mid-1990s. Nanna ranked it as his second favorite Braid album, saying: \\"You can hear the fact that we really needed to nail it and you can tell we’re nervous but excited and really pressed for time. But I’m still happy with the way it sounds.\\" In 2012, the band embarked on a two-week US tour, during which they performed Frame & Canvas in its entirety. Track listing All music by Braid.

The camp is accredited by the American Camp Association and is located in Northwood, New Hampshire, in the United States. Camp Yavneh offers children of ages 8–16 a Jewish camp environment where Jewish values and activities are emphasized. The camp is unaffiliated with the religious movements — considering itself \\"k'lal Yisrael\\" (all Jews are one). There are t'fillot (prayers) daily, offering egalitarian and orthodox services. The camp offers traditional camp activities such as swimming, boating, drama, music, Israeli dance, special arts program, and a daily Hebrew/Judaic class for all levels. Camp Yavneh is Shomer Shabbat and strictly Kosher (with rabbinical supervision). For years, Camp Yavneh served as a \\"second home\\" for thousands of young Jewish children, ages 8–16. Yavneh's Zimriyah has carried on for years, maintaining a tradition of Jewish pride, friendly competition, and song. The Maccabiah games during the second month of camp include sports, song, dance, and art, and they culminate on the second to last night of camp, with a sing-off, a Hebrew play with themed focus on dance and song, and the traditional segment, called \\"Shelet\\". The Shelet presentations are the presentation of the team plaques. Since 2017, Bil Zarch has been the camp director.

It is a sequel to Doom II (1994). A remastered port was released for Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in March 2020, and on Stadia in May 2020. Gameplay A demon approaches the chainsaw wielding player in Staging Area, the first level of the game. Doom 64 plays similarly to earlier games in the Doom series. The player must advance through 32 levels by battling demons, collecting weapons and keys, and activating switches to reach the level's exit while surviving deadly ambushes and traps. The Doom engine and gameplay elements were customized, and all visual assets such as weapon and monster graphics are unique to Doom 64. =Weapons= All the weapons from Doom II are present, but redrawn with new sprites and sound effects. The chainsaw has two blades instead of one, the fists have bloodstained gloves instead of brass knuckles, the plasma gun has an electric core that emits a sparking sound when equipped, the rocket launcher has a small kick when fired, pushing the player back slightly, the shotgun's priming handle is at the grip instead of under the barrel, and the double-barreled \\"Super\\" shotgun reloads faster and causes recoil. A new weapon known as the Laser, or \\"Unmaker\\", was added, using the same cell ammunition as the plasma gun and BFG 9000. It was first mentioned in the Doom Bible and was planned to be featured in the PC Doom games, but never appeared. Its appearance in Doom 64 is its only official appearance prior to Doom Eternal, in which it is spelled \\"Unmaykr\\". With the power of three ancient artifacts found in the game, it becomes more powerful by shooting three laser beams (at a quicker rate than default) instead of one. The first artifact increases the laser speed, the second artifact adds a second laser, and the third artifact allows the weapon to fire three simultaneous lasers which can automatically aim separately from one another, allowing the weapon to attack three different enemies at once. Plot Following the Doom Marine's success thwarting hell in Doom and Doom II: Hell on Earth, a planetary policy is established to quarantine the UAC research installations with apocalyptic levels of radiation. For years, the installations stood motionless and abandoned, until a long forgotten satellite monitoring one of the installations, barely functioning due to years of being subjected to the high levels of radiation, sends a message back to Earth. The message indicates that a single entity, with vast rejuvenation powers and masked by the extreme radiation levels, managed to escape detection. This entity systematically altered decaying dead carnage back into corrupted living tissue, resurrecting the demons. As the only experienced survivor of the Doom episodes, the Marine is sent in alone to exterminate them. Later, he realizes the demons had planned for this, after he unknowingly allowed himself to be lured back into hell. The demons are unable to defeat him, and with the Unmaker, he eventually battles and kills the Mother Demon. The game ends with the Marine, no longer capable of having a normal life following his encounters with hell's forces, deciding to remain in hell forever to ensure no demon ever rises again. Development Doom 64 was developed by Midway Games at its San Diego studio. id Software, the primary developer of the Doom franchise, supervised the project. Development began in late 1994. Its original title was The Absolution, changed to Doom 64 for brand recognition, and \\"The Absolution\\" was reused as the name of the last level. Midway wanted to include every demon from the original games, and a few extra levels, into the final product, but deadlines and storage size constraints of the Nintendo 64 Game Pak cartridges made them exclude the levels and a few demons. Midway stated that a multiplayer mode was not included because Nintendo did not provide the necessary resources for multiplayer programming. Midway justified the decision based on alleged slowdown during split-screen multiplayer in other games on the console and the competitive nature of the mode. A Midway representative stated, \\"Everyone knows that the best part of playing multiplayer is not knowing where your opponent is and with a four- player split-screen, everyone can easily see where their opponents are.\\" The environments were built from 3-dimensional polygon models, and the enemies were created by pre-rendering sprites with SGI workstations. The Nightmare Imp was originally developed for the PlayStation version of Doom and appeared in a near-complete beta of the game, but was removed just prior to release for unknown reasons. It debuted in Doom 64 instead. Doom 64 was slated to be a North American launch game, but near the deadline id Software expressed dissatisfaction with many of the level designs, so Midway postponed the game until April 1997 while redesigning the levels. Nintendo's then-recent decision to remove the ability to run over animals from the Nintendo 64 version of Cruis'n USA raised concerns about the possibility of censoring Doom 64, but Midway vice president of software Mike Abbot said Nintendo had not voiced any concerns about the game's violent content. He pointed out that Cruis'n USA was perceived by the public as a family game, but the Doom series was targeted towards mature gamers, making violent content less of a concern. The music and sound effects were composed by Aubrey Hodges, who also created the original sound effects and music for the PlayStation version two years earlier. The original Doom 64 team was working on a potential sequel titled Doom Absolution designed only for two-player deathmatches soon after the first game was released, but canceled it. Because id Software was impressed with the team's work on Doom 64, they were assigned to the Nintendo 64 version of Quake at this time. Midway Home Entertainment shipped Doom 64 on March 29, 1997, for release on April 4. Reception By the time Doom 64 was released, the original Doom had received ports on nearly every platform capable of running it. Critics agreed that Doom 64 was by far the best-looking Doom to date, exceeding even the PC version. They were enthusiastic about the level designs, deeming them imaginative and much more challenging than those of the original Doom. A Next Generation critic remarked that \\"even the most skillful Doom fans will have their hands full. And pushing door switches often causes whole rooms to rearrange and fold out into new shapes.\\" However, most reviewers said that the new graphics and levels were not enough to keep the game from feeling like yet another port of the original Doom. Peer Schneider of IGN concluded, \\"Make no mistake about it, this is the best update to Doom so farbut if you've played the PC, PSX, SNES, Mac, Saturn, etc versions to death, you can do without this one.\\" GamePro disagreed with the majority on this point, stating that \\"Doom 64 pumps the tried-and-true corridor-shooter formula full of life, with another challenging, intense experience that showcases the system's capabilities.\\" They rated it a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all four categories: graphics, sound, control, and fun factor. Shawn Smith of Electronic Gaming Monthly instead regarded the lack of advancements in the basic Doom gameplay as a positive: \\"Some of you may want to see your space Marine jumping around or swimming underwater. Purists wouldn't want these features added because Doom wasn't about that stuff. I'll have to agree with the purists.\\" Most critics praised the game's musical score for its atmospheric effect. Schneider and GamePro were both pleased with how well the analog control works, but Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot said it wasn't right and said of the game overall, \\"On paper, Doom 64 sounds better than the original could ever hope to be, but the end result feels more like a bastardization of the original.\\" Comparing it to contemporary Nintendo 64 shooter Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Schneider and GamePro both remarked that Doom 64 has less freedom of exploration and depth of control, but is more intense and \\"anxiety-filled\\". In the following years, Doom 64 has garnered a cult following from fans, with Patrick Klepek from Kotaku describing it as the most underrated Doom game. Re-release Versions of Doom 64 for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One by Nightdive Studios were released on March 20, 2020 and for Stadia on May 12, 2020. These were included as a bonus for those who pre-ordered Doom Eternal, and include a new chapter, with the player battling the Mother Demon's sister.

It was created in 1979 and officially registered in Switzerland. The current head of the organization is Princess Olga Andreevna. History The idea for the creation of a family association was thought up by Prince Vsevolod Ioannovich, Prince Roman Petrovich and Prince Andrei Alexandrovich the heads of the Konstantinovichi, Nikolaevichi and Mihailovichi branches of the Imperial Family in order to strengthen the links between the family and protect it from impostors. Following the death of Prince Roman Petrovich in 1978, his son Prince Nicholas Romanovich, after looking through his father's papers found that everything was effectively in place for the creation of a family association. Prince Nicholas then wrote to all the Romanovs who had been in communication with his father and it was agreed that a Family Association should be created. In 1979 the Romanov Family Association was officially formed with Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich as president and Prince Nicholas Romanovich as vice president. Prince Nicholas Romanovich was elected president, following Prince Vasili Alexandrovich who died in 1989. The association accepts that since 3 March (Julian Calendar) / 16 March (Gregorian Calendar), 1917 with the decree of Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia's deferral of acceptance of the throne, that the Russian Provisional Government was recognized. Article IV-b of the bylaws of the Romanov Family Association states \\"The Members of the Association agree that all questions concerning the form of government in Russia and consequently also all matters of a dynastic character have been transmitted to the will of the great Russian people by the Manifest of Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, which followed the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II on the basis of 'general, direct, equal and secret voting'.\\" As a charitable endeavor, the association operates the Romanov Fund for Russia to raise money for aid projects in Russia. Members The Romanov Family Association (RFA) is an organization of legitimate male-line descendants of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia.

It runs from Francestown to Bennington. It is signed as a north–south route, but follows more of an east–west routing. In fact, during its \\"northernmost\\" (westernmost) 2.4 miles, it proceeds southwest while signed north (and vice versa). NH 47 essentially functions as a northern bypass of New Hampshire Route 31 and New Hampshire Route 136, which pass through (and intersect in) Greenfield. Between this intersection and NH 47's endpoints, the three routes form a complete loop. Route description NH 47 begins at an intersection with NH 136 in Francestown. It proceeds generally northwest out of town and crosses into Bennington.

It was created after the Labour Party of Alberta broke up in 1932. Most of the Labour Party merged into the Alberta branch of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, led by Elmer Roper. A small faction of more right-leaning supporters joined the Progressive movement. The party had marginal success in a couple of by-elections before and after the 1935 Alberta provincial election, but did not contest that election. In the 1940 election, a few supporters ran as Independent Progressive candidates after the dissolution of the party. PLP member Ernest Starr (1934 Calgary by-election) later ran as a candidate for Alberta Progressive Conservatives. This party is not to be confused with the communist Labor-Progressive Party.

It is a \\"generalist\\" station, aiming to provide a wide national audience with a full service of news and spoken-word programming, both serious and entertaining, liberally punctuated with an eclectic mix of music. It is broadcast on FM from a nationwide network of transmitters, as well as via the internet. The channel announced during 2016 that it would discontinue transmissions from the Allouis longwave transmitter on 162 kHz with effect from 1 January 2017, thereby saving approximately €6 million per year. Transmission from Allouis of the atomic-clock-generated time signal would, however, continue after this date as the signal is critical for over 200,000 devices deployed within French enterprises and state entities, such as French Railways (SNCF), the electricity distributor ENEDIS, airports, hospitals, municipalities, etc. History France Inter was founded as part of the reorganization of state broadcasting which followed the end of World War II as \\"Paris-Inter\\" and charged with being French public radio's generalist (i.e. \\"full-service\\") service. The channel was renamed \\"France I\\" in 1958, although three years later one of France's most popular radio and television listings magazines was still showing the station's programmes under the heading \\"Paris- Inter\\" with \\"France I\\" as a subtitle.La Semaine Radio-Télé 29/41, 8-14 October 1961 In October 1963 the France I and France II networks were merged to form \\"RTF Inter\\", renamed \\"France Inter\\" with effect from 8 December. The major challenge faced by France Inter at the time of its reorganization in the 1960s was the private \\"peripheral stations\\" (in particular, RTL and Europe 1, broadcasting from powerful transmitters outside France) success in capturing the majority of the French radio audience since the war. They had done so by adopting a modern broadcasting style and earning a reputation for greater freedom from government influence. As well as rapidly modernizing its style to match its competitors, France Inter stressed its freedom from commercial pressures – although it does carry a limited amount of paid-for advertising – and especially presented itself as intelligent radio accessible to a general audience under the slogan Écoutez la différence (\\"Listen to the difference\\").  Slogans  * 1975: Écoutez la différence (Hear the difference) * 1983: France Inter, pour ceux qui ont quelque chose entre les oreilles (France Inter, for those who have something between their ears) * 1987: Plus haut la radio !

It was originally released on LP in 1972 in a clear plastic sleeve. Production Beefheart's third album Trout Mask Replica established him as a critically acclaimed artist, but it sold poorly. For this album Beefheart wanted more commercial success – hence his decision to work with the widely respected team of producer Ted Templeman and engineer Donn Landee, who previously created hits for artists such as the Doobie Brothers, Carly Simon and Van Morrison. Clear Spot gathers together much of the lyrical material that Beefheart had created or formulated at the beginning of The Spotlight Kid recordings. Former Mothers of Invention and Little Feat bassist Roy Estrada joined the band on this album and is credited as \\"Oréjon\\" (big ears) on the album's sleeve while noted session percussionist Milt Holland also contributed percussion. Releases The original United States release of the album was in a specially-produced clear plastic sleeve. The title Clear Spot was embossed on the front flap, with the record clearly visible inside without a liner. This reflected the title: a clear cover with the black vinyl disc as a visible spot. The original concept was for the disc to be of clear vinyl, but this was abandoned due to financial constraints. The package also included a white card insert, with the band name and credits. For the UK this was a single weight card, but in the US issues this was back-to-back card with radius corners at the foot. For U.S. reissues and initial release in other countries, a more traditional black-on-white printed sleeve was employed. The insert (or subsequent cover) shows a photo of Beefheart and band members in the control center of the Planetarium of Griffith Park Observatory, Los Angeles, California. Griffith Park and the neighboring Los Angeles Zoo had inspired the young Beefheart (born Don Glen Vliet).Splinters book by Artist Ink Editions (2003), within Riding Some Kind Of Unusual Skull Sleigh Ltd. Ed. boxed work. On CD, the album is now available only as a \\"two for one\\" with its predecessor The Spotlight Kid, giving an overview of the work created when the band resided in Felton (near Santa Cruz, California) and Trinidad in Humboldt County. Separately, the two albums are only available as vinyl LP reissues. In 2015, Rhino Records remastered and re-released this album, along with The Spotlight Kid and Lick My Decals Off, Baby in a box-set titled Sun Zoom Spark, rendering these albums available after being out-of-print for years.

Such a statement implies that an abstract machine which solves problems in A achieves no additional power if it is given the ability to solve problems in B at unit cost. In particular, this means that if B is low for A then B is contained in A. Informally, lowness means that problems in B are not only solvable by machines which can solve problems in A, but are “easy to solve”. An A machine can simulate many oracle queries to B without exceeding its resource bounds. Results and relationships that establish one class as low for another are often called lowness results. The set of languages low for a complexity class A is denoted Low(A).  Classes that are low for themselves  Several natural complexity classes are known to be low for themselves. Such a class is sometimes called self-low. Scott Aaronson calls such a class a physical complexity class.http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2070#comment-282988 Note that being self-low is a stronger condition than being closed under complement. Informally, a class being low for itself means a problem can use other problems in the class as unit-cost subroutines without exceeding the power of the complexity class. The following classes are known to be self-low: * P is self-low (that is, PP = P) because polynomial-time algorithms are closed under composition: a polynomial-time algorithm can make polynomially many queries to other polynomial-time algorithms, while retaining a polynomial running time. * PSPACE (with restricted oracle access mechanism) is also self- low, and this can be established by exactly the same argument. * L is self-low because it can simulate log space oracle queries in log space, reusing the same space for each query. * NC is also self-low for the same reason. * BPP is also low for itself and the same arguments almost work for BPP, but one has to account for errors, making it slightly harder to show that BPP is low for itself. * Similarly, the argument for BPP almost goes through for BQP, but we have to additionally show that quantum queries can be performed in coherent superposition.Bernstein and Vazirani, Quantum complexity theory, SIAM Journal on Computing, 26(5):1411-1473, 1997. * Both Parity P ({\\\\oplus}\\\\hbox{P}) and BPP are low for themselves. These were important in showing Toda's theorem. * NP ∩ coNP is low for itself. Every class which is low for itself is closed under complement, provided that it is powerful enough to negate the boolean result. This implies that NP isn't low for itself unless NP = co-NP, which is considered unlikely because it implies that the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the first level, whereas it is widely believed that the hierarchy is infinite. The converse to this statement is not true. If a class is closed under complement, it does not mean that the class is low for itself. An example of such a class is EXP, which is closed under complement, but is not low for itself.  Classes that are low for other complexity classes  Some of the more complex and famous results regarding lowness of classes include: * BQP is low for PP L. Fortnow and J. D. Rogers. Complexity limitations on quantum computation. In Proceedings of IEEE Complexity '98, p.202-209. 1998. . In other words, a program based around taking the majority decision of an unbounded number of iterations of a poly-time randomized algorithm can easily solve all the problems that a quantum computer can solve efficiently. * The graph isomorphism problem is low for Parity P ({\\\\oplus}\\\\hbox{P}).V. Arvind and P. Kurur. Graph isomorphism is in SPP. . 2002. This means that if we can determine whether an NP machine has an even or odd number of accepting paths, we can easily solve graph isomorphism. In fact, it was later shown that graph isomorphism is low for ZPPNP.Vikraman Arvind and Johannes Köbler. Graph Isomorphism Is Low for ZPP(NP) and Other Lowness Results. Proceedings of the 17th Annual Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science, , p.431-442. 2000. * Amplified PP is low for PP.L. Li. On the Counting Functions. PhD thesis, University of Chicago. 1993. * NP ∩ coNP is equal to the set of languages low for NP, i.e., Low(NP) = NP ∩ coNP. * AM ∩ coAM is low for ZPPNP.  Applications  Lowness is particularly valuable in relativization arguments, where it can be used to establish that the power of a class does not change in the \\"relativized universe\\" where a particular oracle machine is available for free. This allows us to reason about it in the same manner we normally would. For example, in the relativized universe of BQP, PP is still closed under union and intersection. It's also useful when seeking to expand the power of a machine with oracles, because lowness results determine when the machine's power remains the same.

He graduated from Harvard University in 1952 and then joined the U.S. Army for 22 months. After being discharged from the army, he obtained a master's degree from the University of Connecticut. In 1955 Lee entered the Ph.D. program at Yale University where he worked under Henry A. Fairbank in the low-temperature physics group, doing experimental research on liquid 3He. After graduating from Yale in 1959, Lee took a job at Cornell University, where he was responsible for setting up the new Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics. Shortly after arriving at Cornell he met his future wife, Dana, then a PhD student in another department; the couple went on to have two sons. Lee moved his laboratory from Cornell to Texas A&M; University on November 16, 2009.http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2009/10/01/News/Nobel.Prize.Winner.Joins.Am.Faculty-3788924.shtml In the summer of 2016, Lee lost his wife, Dana, due to un-diagnosed health issues. Work The work that led to Lee's Nobel Prize was performed in the early 1970s. Lee, together with Robert C. Richardson and graduate student, Doug Osheroff used a Pomeranchuk cell to investigate the behaviour of 3He at temperatures within a few thousandths of a degree of absolute zero. They discovered unexpected effects in their measurements, which they eventually explained as phase transitions to a superfluid phase of 3He. Lee, Richardson and Osheroff were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1996 for this discovery. Lee's research also covered a number of other topics in low- temperature physics, particularly relating to liquid, solid and superfluid helium (4He, 3He and mixtures of the two). Particular discoveries include the antiferromagnetic ordering in solid helium-3, nuclear spin waves in spin polarized atomic hydrogen gas with Jack H. Freed, and the tri-critical point on the phase separation curve of liquid 4He-3He, in collaboration with his Cornell colleague John Reppy. His former research group at Cornell currently studies impurity-helium solids. As well as the Nobel Prize, other prizes won by Lee include the 1976 Sir Francis Simon Memorial Prize of the British Institute of Physics and the 1981 Oliver Buckley Prize of the American Physical Society along with Doug Osheroff and Robert Richardson for their superfluid 3He work. In 1997, Lee received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Lee is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Lee is currently teaching physics at Texas A&M; University and continuing his (formerly Cornell-based) research program there as well. Lee is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May of 2008, urging him to \\"reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill\\" by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

After gastrulation, neural crest cells are specified at the border of the neural plate and the non-neural ectoderm. During neurulation, the borders of the neural plate, also known as the neural folds, converge at the dorsal midline to form the neural tube.Brooker, R.J. 2014, Biology, 3rd edn, McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, 1084 Subsequently, neural crest cells from the roof plate of the neural tube undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, delaminating from the neuroepithelium and migrating through the periphery where they differentiate into varied cell types. The emergence of neural crest was important in vertebrate evolution because many of its structural derivatives are defining features of the vertebrate clade. Underlying the development of neural crest is a gene regulatory network, described as a set of interacting signals, transcription factors, and downstream effector genes that confer cell characteristics such as multipotency and migratory capabilities. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of neural crest formation is important for our knowledge of human disease because of its contributions to multiple cell lineages. Abnormalities in neural crest development cause neurocristopathies, which include conditions such as frontonasal dysplasia, Waardenburg–Shah syndrome, and DiGeorge syndrome. Therefore, defining the mechanisms of neural crest development may reveal key insights into vertebrate evolution and neurocristopathies. History Neural crest was first described in the chick embryo by Wilhelm His Sr. in 1868 as \\"the cord in between\\" (Zwischenstrang) because of its origin between the neural plate and non-neural ectoderm. He named the tissue ganglionic crest since its final destination was each lateral side of the neural tube where it differentiated into spinal ganglia. During the first half of the 20th century the majority of research on neural crest was done using amphibian embryos which was reviewed by Hörstadius (1950) in a well known monograph.Hörstadius, S. (1950). The Neural Crest: Its Properties and Derivatives in the Light of Experimental Research. Oxford University Press, London, 111 p. Cell labeling techniques advanced the field of neural crest because they allowed researchers to visualize the migration of the tissue throughout the developing embryos. In the 1960s Weston and Chibon utilized radioisotopic labeling of the nucleus with tritiated thymidine in chick and amphibian embryo respectively. However, this method suffers from drawbacks of stability, since every time the labeled cell divides the signal is diluted. Modern cell labeling techniques such as rhodamine-lysinated dextran and the vital dye diI have also been developed to transiently mark neural crest lineages. The quail-chick marking system, devised by Nicole Le Douarin in 1969, was another instrumental technique used to track neural crest cells. Chimeras, generated through transplantation, enabled researchers to distinguish neural crest cells of one species from the surrounding tissue of another species. With this technique, generations of scientists were able to reliably mark and study the ontogeny of neural crest cells. Induction A molecular cascade of events is involved in establishing the migratory and multipotent characteristics of neural crest cells. This gene regulatory network can be subdivided into the following four sub-networks described below. =Inductive signals= First, extracellular signaling molecules, secreted from the adjacent epidermis and underlying mesoderm such as Wnts, BMPs and Fgfs separate the non-neural ectoderm (epidermis) from the neural plate during neural induction. Wnt signaling has been demonstrated in neural crest induction in several species through gain-of-function and loss-of- function experiments. In coherence with this observation, the promoter region of slug (a neural crest specific gene) contains a binding site for transcription factors involved in the activation of Wnt-dependent target genes, suggestive of a direct role of Wnt signaling in neural crest specification. The current role of BMP in neural crest formation is associated with the induction of the neural plate. BMP antagonists diffusing from the ectoderm generates a gradient of BMP activity. In this manner, the neural crest lineage forms from intermediate levels of BMP signaling required for the development of the neural plate (low BMP) and epidermis (high BMP). Fgf from the paraxial mesoderm has been suggested as a source of neural crest inductive signal. Researchers have demonstrated that the expression of dominate-negative Fgf receptor in ectoderm explants blocks neural crest induction when recombined with paraxial mesoderm. The understanding of the role of BMP, Wnt, and Fgf pathways on neural crest specifier expression remains incomplete. =Neural plate border specifiers= Signaling events that establish the neural plate border lead to the expression of a set of transcription factors delineated here as neural plate border specifiers. These molecules include Zic factors, Pax3/7, Dlx5, Msx1/2 which may mediate the influence of Wnts, BMPs, and Fgfs. These genes are expressed broadly at the neural plate border region and precede the expression of bona fide neural crest markers. Experimental evidence places these transcription factors upstream of neural crest specifiers. For example, in Xenopus Msx1 is necessary and sufficient for the expression of Slug, Snail, and FoxD3. Furthermore, Pax3 is essential for FoxD3 expression in mouse embryos. =Neural crest specifiers= Following the expression of neural plate border specifiers is a collection of genes including Slug/Snail, FoxD3, Sox10, Sox9, AP-2 and c-Myc. This suite of genes, designated here as neural crest specifiers, are activated in emergent neural crest cells. At least in Xenopus, every neural crest specifier is necessary and/or sufficient for the expression of all other specifiers, demonstrating the existence of extensive cross-regulation. Moreover, this model organism was instrumental in the elucidation of the role of the Hedghehog signaling pathway in the specification of the neural crest, with the transcription factor Gli2 playing a key role. Outside of the tightly regulated network of neural crest specifiers are two other transcription factors Twist and Id. Twist, a bHLH transcription factor, is required for mesenchyme differentiation of the pharyngeal arch structures. Id is a direct target of c-Myc and is known to be important for the maintenance of neural crest stem cells. =Neural crest effector genes= Finally, neural crest specifiers turn on the expression of effector genes, which confer certain properties such as migration and multipotency. Two neural crest effectors, Rho GTPases and cadherins, function in delamination by regulating cell morphology and adhesive properties. Sox9 and Sox10 regulate neural crest differentiation by activating many cell-type- specific effectors including Mitf, P0, Cx32, Trp and cKit.

Adapted from Bronner-Fraser 2004  Migration  Delamination of neural crest cells during development. Downregulation of CAMs and tight junction proteins is followed by secretion of MMPs and subsequent delamination. The migration of neural crest cells involves a highly coordinated cascade of events that begins with closure of the dorsal neural tube. = Delamination = After fusion of the neural fold to create the neural tube, cells originally located in the neural plate border become neural crest cells. For migration to begin, neural crest cells must undergo a process called delamination that involves a full or partial epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT). Delamination is defined as the separation of tissue into different populations, in this case neural crest cells separating from the surrounding tissue. Conversely, EMT is a series of events coordinating a change from an epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype. For example, delamination in chick embryos is triggered by a BMP/Wnt cascade that induces the expression of EMT promoting transcription factors such as SNAI2 and FoxD3. Although all neural crest cells undergo EMT, the timing of delamination occurs at different stages in different organisms: in Xenopus laevis embryos there is a massive delamination that occurs when the neural plate is not entirely fused, whereas delamination in the chick embryo occurs during fusion of the neural fold. Prior to delamination, presumptive neural crest cells are initially anchored to neighboring cells by tight junction proteins such as occludin and cell adhesion molecules such as NCAM and N-Cadherin. Dorsally expressed BMPs initiate delamination by inducing the expression of the zinc finger protein transcription factors snail, slug, and twist. These factors play a direct role in inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by reducing expression of occludin and N-Cadherin in addition to promoting modification of NCAMs with polysialic acid residues to decrease adhesiveness. Neural crest cells also begin expressing proteases capable of degrading cadherins such as ADAM10 and secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the overlying basal lamina of the neural tube to allow neural crest cells to escape. Additionally, neural crest cells begin expressing integrins that associate with extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen, fibronectin, and laminin, during migration. Once the basal lamina becomes permeable the neural crest cells can begin migrating throughout the embryo. = Migration = Migration of neural crest cells during development. Grey arrows indicate the direction of the paths crest cells migrate. (R=Rostral, C=Caudal) Neural crest cell migration occurs in a rostral to caudal direction without the need of a neuronal scaffold such as along a radial glial cell. For this reason the crest cell migration process is termed “free migration”. Instead of scaffolding on progenitor cells, neural crest migration is the result of repulsive guidance via EphB/EphrinB and semaphorin/neuropilin signaling, interactions with the extracellular matrix, and contact inhibition with one another. While Ephrin and Eph proteins have the capacity to undergo bi-directional signaling, neural crest cell repulsion employs predominantly forward signaling to initiate a response within the receptor bearing neural crest cell. Burgeoning neural crest cells express EphB, a receptor tyrosine kinase, which binds the EphrinB transmembrane ligand expressed in the caudal half of each somite. When these two domains interact it causes receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of rhoGTPases, and eventual cytoskeletal rearrangements within the crest cells inducing them to repel. This phenomenon allows neural crest cells to funnel through the rostral portion of each somite. Semaphorin-neuropilin repulsive signaling works synergistically with EphB signaling to guide neural crest cells down the rostral half of somites in mice. In chick embryos, semaphorin acts in the cephalic region to guide neural crest cells through the pharyngeal arches. On top of repulsive repulsive signaling, neural crest cells express β1and α4 integrins which allows for binding and guided interaction with collagen, laminin, and fibronectin of the extracellular matrix as they travel. Additionally, crest cells have intrinsic contact inhibition with one another while freely invading tissues of different origin such as mesoderm. Neural crest cells that migrate through the rostral half of somites differentiate into sensory and sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system. The other main route neural crest cells take is dorsolaterally between the epidermis and the dermamyotome. Cells migrating through this path differentiate into pigment cells of the dermis. Further neural crest cell differentiation and specification into their final cell type is biased by their spatiotemporal subjection to morphogenic cues such as BMP, Wnt, FGF, Hox, and Notch. Clinical significance Neurocristopathies result from the abnormal specification, migration, differentiation or death of neural crest cells throughout embryonic development. This group of diseases comprises a wide spectrum of congenital malformations affecting many newborns. Additionally, they arise because of genetic defects affecting the formation of neural crest and because of the action of Teratogens = Waardenburg's syndrome = Waardenburg's syndrome is a neurocristopathy that results from defective neural crest cell migration. The condition's main characteristics include piebaldism and congenital deafness. In the case of piebaldism, the colorless skin areas are caused by a total absence of neural crest-derived pigment-producing melanocytes. There are four different types of Waardenburg's syndrome, each with distinct genetic and physiological features. Types I and II are distinguished based on whether or not family members of the affected individual have dystopia canthorum. Type III gives rise to upper limb abnormalities. Lastly, type IV is also known as Waardenburg-Shah syndrome, and afflicted individuals display both Waardenburg's syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease.\\"Waardenburg syndrome\\". Genetics Home Reference. October 2012. Types I and III are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, while II and IV exhibit an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Overall, Waardenburg's syndrome is rare, with an incidence of ~ 2/100,000 people in the United States. All races and sexes are equally affected. There is no current cure or treatment for Waardenburg's syndrome. = Hirschsprung's Disease = Also implicated in defects related to neural crest cell development and migration is Hirschsprung's disease (HD or HSCR), characterized by a lack of innervation in regions of the intestine. This lack of innervation can lead to further physiological abnormalities like an enlarged colon (megacolon), obstruction of the bowels, or even slowed growth. In healthy development, neural crest cells migrate into the gut and form the enteric ganglia. Genes playing a role in the healthy migration of these neural crest cells to the gut include RET, GDNF, GFRα, EDN3, and EDNRB. RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), forms a complex with GDNF and GFRα. EDN3 and EDNRB are then implicated in the same signaling network. When this signaling is disrupted in mice, aganglionosis, or the lack of these enteric ganglia occurs. = Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder = Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is among the most common causes of developmental defects. Depending on the extent of the exposure and the severity of the resulting abnormalities, patients are diagnosed within a continuum of disorders broadly labeled Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Severe FASD can impair neural crest migration, as evidenced by characteristic craniofacial abnormalities including short palpebral fissures, an elongated upper lip, and a smoothened philtrum. However, due to the promiscuous nature of ethanol binding, the mechanisms by which these abnormalities arise is still unclear. Cell culture explants of neural crest cells as well as in vivo developing zebrafish embryos exposed to ethanol show a decreased number of migratory cells and decreased distances travelled by migrating neural crest cells. The mechanisms behind these changes are not well understood, but evidence suggests PAE can increase apoptosis due to increased cytosolic calcium levels caused by IP3-mediated release of calcium from intracellular stores. It has also been proposed that the decreased viability of ethanol- exposed neural crest cells is caused by increased oxidative stress. Despite these, and other advances much remains to be discovered about how ethanol affects neural crest development. For example, it appears that ethanol differentially affects certain neural crest cells over others; that is, while craniofacial abnormalities are common in PAE, neural crest-derived pigment cells appear to be minimally affected. = DiGeorge syndrome = DiGeorge syndrome is associated with deletions or translocations of a small segment in the human chromosome 22. This deletion may disrupt rostral neural crest cell migration or development. Some defects observed are linked to the pharyngeal pouch system, which receives contribution from rostral migratory crest cells. The symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome include congenital heart defects, facial defects, and some neurological and learning disabilities. Patients with 22q11 deletions have also been reported to have higher incidence of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. = Treacher Collins Syndrome = Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS) results from the compromised development of the first and second pharyngeal arches during the early embryonic stage, which ultimately leads to mid and lower face abnormalities. TCS is caused by the missense mutation of the TCOF1 gene, which causes neural crest cells to undergo apoptosis during embryogenesis. Although mutations of the TCOF1 gene are among the best characterized in their role in TCS, mutations in POLR1C and POLR1D genes have also been linked to the pathogenesis of TCS. Cell lineages Neural crest cells originating from different positions along the anterior- posterior axis develop into various tissues. These regions of neural crest can be divided into four main functional domains, which include the cranial neural crest, trunk neural crest, vagal and sacral neural crest, and cardiac neural crest. =Cranial neural crest= Cranial neural crest migrates dorsolaterally to form the craniofacial mesenchyme that differentiates into various cranial ganglia and craniofacial cartilages and bones.Taneyhill, L.A. (2008). \\"To adhere or not to adhere: the role of Cadherins in neural crest development\\". Cell Adh Migr. 2, 223–30. These cells enter the pharyngeal pouches and arches where they contribute to the thymus, bones of the middle ear and jaw and the odontoblasts of the tooth primordia.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=dbio∂=A3109#A3133 =Trunk neural crest= Trunk neural crest gives rise two populations of cells. One group of cells fated to become melanocytes migrates dorsolaterally into the ectoderm towards the ventral midline. A second group of cells migrates ventrolaterally through the anterior portion of each sclerotome. The cells that stay in the sclerotome form the dorsal root ganglia, whereas those that continue more ventrally form the sympathetic ganglia, adrenal medulla, and the nerves surrounding the aorta. =Vagal and sacral neural crest= The vagal and sacral neural crest cells develop into the ganglia of the enteric nervous system and the parasympathetic ganglia. =Cardiac neural crest= Cardiac neural crest develops into melanocytes, cartilage, connective tissue and neurons of some pharyngeal arches. Also, this domain gives rise to regions of the heart such as the musculo-connective tissue of the large arteries, and part of the septum, which divides the pulmonary circulation from the aorta. The semilunar valves of the heart are associated with neural crest cells according to new research. Evolution Several structures that distinguish the vertebrates from other chordates are formed from the derivatives of neural crest cells. In their \\"New head\\" theory, Gans and Northcut argue that the presence of neural crest was the basis for vertebrate specific features, such as sensory ganglia and cranial skeleton. Furthermore, the appearance of these features was pivotal in vertebrate evolution because it enabled a predatory lifestyle. However, considering the neural crest a vertebrate innovation does not mean that it arose de novo. Instead, new structures often arise through modification of existing developmental regulatory programs. For example, regulatory programs may be changed by the co-option of new upstream regulators or by the employment of new downstream gene targets, thus placing existing networks in a novel context. This idea is supported by in situ hybridization data that shows the conservation of the neural plate border specifiers in protochordates, which suggest that part of the neural crest precursor network was present in a common ancestor to the chordates. In some non-vertebrate chordates such as tunicates a lineage of cells (melanocytes) has been identified, which are similar to neural crest cells in vertebrates. This implies that a rudimentary neural crest existed in a common ancestor of vertebrates and tunicates.

(1995) https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/28/style/chronicle-070246.htmlBroek, Pieter (1994) \\"A Genealogy of The Romanov Dynasty, The Imperial House of Russia, 1825–1994\\" Noble House Publications (; 26 September 1922 – 15 September 2014) was a claimant to the headship of the House of Romanov and president of the Romanov Family Association. Although undoubtedly a descendant of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, his claimed titles and official membership in the former Imperial House were disputed by those who maintained that his parents' marriage violated the laws of Imperial Russia.Massie, ch. 19: \\"The Romanov Emigres,\\" esp. pp. 264–265 (Russian Law of Succession) and pp. 274–275. Family and childhood Prince Nicholas was born in Cap d'Antibes near Antibes, France, the eldest son of Prince Roman Petrovich and his wife Princess Praskovia Dmitrievna (née Countess Sheremeteva). Prince Nicholas had a younger brother, Prince Dimitri Romanovich. Their father Prince Roman Petrovich was the only son of Grand Duke Peter Nicolaievich and Grand Duchess Militsa Nikolaievna (née Princess of Montenegro). His grandfather was the younger son of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich and Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrovna (née Duchess of Oldenburg). His great grandfather Nicholas Nikolaevich was a younger son of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia and Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna (née Princess Charlotte of Prussia) and founded the Nikolaevichi branch of the Russian Imperial Family. Prince Nicholas was brought up in Cap d'Antibes with his family still using the Julian calendar and he spoke both fluent Russian and French from his childhood on. He was brought up in a Russian environment with his local church having a Russian priest and his family employing Russian staff and a Russian nanny. Education and naval aspirations Prince Nicholas received a private education in France with his studies following the old Russian school curriculum. In 1936 his family moved to Italy due to the standard of schooling supposedly being better there. He aspired to be a naval officer and had convinced his parents by the age of 12 that this was his dream. However, as he was a Romanov and there was a Soviet Navy and not an Imperial Russian Navy, he decided to work towards a career in the Italian Navy. Using his family's close relationship to the Italian Royal Family (both his grandmother Militsa and Queen Helena of Italy, wife of King Victor Emmanuel III, were daughters of King Nicholas I of Montenegro) he began to study in Italy under the tutelage of a retired Italian Naval officer with the aim of attending the Naval Academy of Livorno. However, Nicholas's hopes of a Naval career evaporated when he showed signs of near-sightedness. He completed his education in Italy graduating from a Liceo classico in 1942. World War II and post war During World War II, Prince Nicholas and his family lived at the residence of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. When the King left Rome, Nicholas and his family went into hiding for nine months. During the occupation of Rome by Germany, Nicholas's grandmother, who was at great risk of deportation as a sister of the Queen, had to take shelter in the Holy See. In 1942, the ruling Fascists in Italy approached Prince Nicholas to offer him the throne of Montenegro. He declined. Prince Nicholas wanted to study engineering at the University of Rome but the war prevented this, so following its conclusion, he found employment by working as a civilian for the Allies in the Psychological Warfare Division and the United States Information Service. On the advice of King Umberto II Prince Nicholas and his family left Italy for Egypt in 1946. While living in Egypt he was involved in the purchasing and sale of Turkish tobacco as well as finding work in an insurance company. Returning to Europe in 1950 Prince Nicholas worked in Rome for the Austin Motor Company until 1954. Following the death of his brother-in-law he took over the management of his wife's property and business in Tuscany. The business was a large farm which he managed for 25 years from 1955 to 1980 where he bred Chianina cattle and produced wine. He sold the farm in 1982 and moved to Rougemont, Switzerland. A refugee from birth, Prince Nicholas was a stateless person and used to travel abroad on a letter issued by the King of Greece. He finally became a citizen of Italy in 1988. Prince Nicholas visited Russia for the first time in June 1992 when he acted as a second tour guide for a group of businessmen. He often appeared in the media to talk about the Romanovs, giving over 100 television interviews, and appearing in television documentaries such as the 2003 Danish documentary \\"En Kongelig familie\\" and the 2007 France 3 produced documentary called \\"Un nom en héritage, les Romanov\\". In 1999, a documentary on his life was produced by the Russian television channel NTV. Romanov Family Association His father Roman Petrovich came up with the idea of a family association of the Romanovs in the mid-1970s. After looking through the papers of his father, who died in 1978, Nicholas found that everything was in place for its creation. He then wrote to all the members of the Romanov family who had been in communication with his father and it was agreed that a family association should be created. A year later, in 1979, the Romanov Family Association was officially formed with Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich as president and Nicholas as vice-president. When Vasili Alexandrovich became president in 1980, Nicholas remained vice- president. In 1989, after the death of Vasili Alexandrovich, Prince Nicholas was elected the new president of the Romanov Family Association. The Association currently has as members the majority of the male-line descendants of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, although Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna has never joined, nor did her late father Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich. Succession claims The official position of the Romanov Family Association is that the rights of the family to the Russian Throne were suspended when Emperor Nicholas II abdicated for himself and for his son Tsarevich Alexei in favour of his brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich who then deferred ascending the Throne until a Constituent Assembly ratified his rule. Emperor Michael II, as he was legally pronounced by Nicholas II, did not abdicate but empowered the Provisional Government to rule. Michael's \\"reign\\" was ended with his execution in 1918. Prince Nicholas considered that following the death of Grand Duke Vladimir Cyrillovich in 1992 that he was head of the House of Romanov and his rightful successor. On the basis that Vladimir Cyrillovich was the last male dynast and all other Romanovs are excluded due to their parents' \\"unequal\\" marriages, Vladimir's daughter Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna also put forward a claim to the headship of the imperial house on her father's death. With the exception of Grand Duchess Maria, Prince Nicholas was recognized by the rest of the family as head of the Imperial House.Massie p. 274 However, the final edition of the Almanach de Gotha published by Justus Perthes, in 1944, stated that the marriage of Nicholas's parents was \\"not in conformity with the laws of the house\\"\\"Almanach de Gotha\\", Russie, (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1944), page 107, (French) \\"en mariage non-conforme aux lois de la maison\\". although some previous editions had listed him as a dynastic member of the Imperial House. Prince Nicholas said regarding \\"unequal\\" marriages in the Imperial Family: > Our parents married commoners. So what? We have married commoners. Again, so > what? There was nobody to ask us to renounce our rights, so we married > without renouncing them, and we and our children still have rights to the > throne of Russia.Massie p. 278 Prince Nicholas led the Romanov family at the funeral in St. Petersburg of the last Russian Emperor Nicholas II and his family in July 1998. As head of the family he was also present at the reburial of the remains of the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna in Russia in September 2006. Prince Nicholas and his brother Prince Dmitri had been responsible for lobbying the Danish royal family and the Russian President Vladimir Putin to allow the transfer of the Dowager Empress's remains to Russia so they could be buried alongside her husband Emperor Alexander III. Until his marriage to a Roman Catholic, Prince Nicholas was in the line of succession to the British throne through his descent from Nicholas the First's wife Charlotte of Prussia, a descendant of George I of Great Britain. Marriage and children Coat of arms of the House of della Gherardesca In 1950, Prince Nicholas and the Countess Sveva della Gherardesca (born 1930), a member of the Italian della Gherardesca noble family from Tuscany and a direct descendant of Count Ugolino della Gherardesca, met at a party in Rome. They were married in Florence in a civil ceremony on 31 December 1951 followed by a religious ceremony on 21 January 1952 in the Russian Cathedral at Cannes. Prince Nicholas and his wife had three daughters: *Princess Natalia Nikolaevna Romanova (born 1952), married to Giuseppe Consolo (born 1948). Her daughter is the Italian actress Nicoletta Romanoff. *Princess Elisaveta Nikolaevna Romanova (born 1956), married to Mauro Bonacini (born 1950); *Princess Tatiana Nikolaevna Romanova (born 1961), married firstly to Giambattista Alessandri (born 1958), then Giancarlo Tirotti (born 1947). Prince Nicholas and his wife lived in Rougemont, Switzerland, for seven months every year, usually in the winter. During the rest of the year they stayed in Italy with their daughters. The prince still used the Julian calendar and was fluent in French, Russian, Italian and English. He was also able to read Spanish. Prince Nicholas's death in Tuscany aged 91 was reported on 15 September 2014. He was survived by his wife, their three children, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Title and style *His Highness Prince Nicholas Romanovich of Russia Since the Russian Revolution, members of the Romanov family have tended to drop the territorial designation \\"of Russia\\" and use a princely title with the surname Romanov.

Comparsas are large ensembles of musicians, singers and dancers with a specific costume and choreography which perform in the street carnivals of Santiago de Cuba and Havana.Millet, José and Brea Rafael 1989. Del carnival santiaguero: congas y paseos. In Oscar Ruiz Miyares (ed) Guía cultural de Santiago de Cuba. The instrumentation differs between congas santiagueras and congas habaneras. Congas santiagueras include the corneta china (Chinese cornet), which is an adaptation of the Cantonese suona introduced in Oriente in 1915, and its percussion section comprises bocúes (similar to African ashiko drums), the quinto (highest pitched conga drum), galletas and the pilón, as well as brakes which are struck with metal sticks. Congas habaneras lack the corneta china but include trumpets, trombones and saxophones, and they have a different set of percussion instruments: redoblantes (side drums), bombos (bass drums), quinto, tumbadora (the lowest pitched conga drum), and metallic idiophones such as cowbells, spoons, frying pans and rims. Congas and comparsas have a long history which dates back to the 19th century, with musical traditions being passed down from one generation to the next. The older comparsas are derived from cabildos de nación or other social groups, whereas the later ones, called paseos, are derived from barrios (neighbourhoods). The music of the congas has become a genre itself, being introduced into Cuban popular music in the early 20th century by artists such as Eliseo Grenet and Armando Oréfiche and his Havana Cuban Boys. They have been present for decades in the repertoire of many conjuntos, Cuban big bands and descarga ensembles, also having an influence on modern genres such as salsa and songo. The conga drum, also known in Cuba as tumbadora, took its name from the congas de comparsa.  History  The conga Paso Franco playing in the streets of Santiago = Origins = The history of the conga (also known as comparsa conga or conga de comparsa) is obscure and its origins remain largely unknown. In the early 19th century, although the word \\"conga\\" is not found in written sources, there are references to \\"tumbas\\", and, according to Brea and Millet (1993:204), \\"tumba\\" refers to the percussion ensemble of the conga. \\"Tumba\\" is mentioned in connection with mamarrachos (summer festivals in Santiago de Cuba) as early as 1847 (Pérez I 1988:54). A word that may be synonymous with \\"tumba\\" is the word \\"tango\\", mentioned as early as 1856 (Pérez I 1988:79). Unfortunately, most 19th-century writers were extremely negative towards Afro-Cuban culture and little information about the tumbas or tangos was recorded.  Relation to Kongo ethnic group  \\"Congo\\" was the word used to designate African slaves brought to Cuba from the Congo region of Africa (currently the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola). According to the rules of Spanish grammar, \\"congo\\" became a masculine noun/adjective and its feminine counterpart was formed by changing final \\"o\\" to \\"a.\\" This Spanish noun/adjective pair has been used in Cuba to designate anything pertaining to the above-mentioned African slaves and their culture. Therefore, some have assumed that \\"conga\\" was originally an adjective (as in the expression comparsa conga), and that the comparsa was dropped and conga changed to a noun (del Carmen et al. 2005). However, the word conga may also derive from either \\"maconga\\" (song) or \\"nkunga\\" (song, sound) in \\"the language of the Congo\\" (Ortiz 1924:118). Ortiz (II 1952-5:34) also states that the drum called bokú (one of the instruments of the conga) is \\"...typical of the congos.\\" Goodman mentions the “comparsa conga” in conjunction with a carnaval figure known as “el Rey del Congo” (the \\"King of the Congo”), which seems to confirm a kongo ethnic connection to the conga (Pérez I 1988:104).Walter Goodman 1873. The Pearl of the Antilles or an artist in Cuba. Spanish transl. Havana 1965. A section entitled Máscaras en Santiago de Cuba (“Masquerades in Santiago de Cuba”), is reproduced in Pérez I 1988:97-106. Also, the word bokú means “drum” in Kikongo (Orovio 1981:58). = Antipathy after independence = In the early years after the establishment of the Republic of Cuba in 1902, there were numerous decrees by successive mayors of Santiago de Cuba banning \\"African drums and tangos\\". (Pérez I 1988:177, etc.) Apparently, these decrees were not faithfully enforced: > “In spite of the prohibitive proclamation, the tumbas echoed loudly > everywhere, including in the most central and heavily-traveled areas.

In reality, it was just a question of maintaining > on paper that which could not really be enforced due to the express desire > of the bourgeoisie, to whom these manifestations were a diversion, > ‘something colorful’ and amusing.” (Pérez I 1988:179, note 13) = Debate = Opponents to the conga in print outnumbered defenders. The conga was a thing of the illiterate Afro-Cuban working people, while the writers of editorials and angry letters to the editor were upper-class Hispano-Cubans. One prominent attacker of the conga, and perhaps the most florid in his prose, was the long-time mayor of Santiago, Desiderio Alberto Arnaz II (father of American TV star Desi Arnaz), who expressed the feelings of some upper-class Cubans in a newspaper article of 1925: > “I will have you know that the initial days of our traditional masquerades - > which have just passed - have left painful impressions in my mind. Allow me > to explain. In every way, the carnival has been a joyful celebration of the > soul of the people, an exhibition of good artistic taste, a competition of > original ideas, a contest in which thought and action have always vied in > giving objective form to the perfect conception of Beauty and towards the > noble intent of the dignification of society; Paris, Rome, Venice, Madrid > and Havana itself offer in their carnestolendas lessons on how complaisant > liberty ought to be used in those periods of fantasy in order to educate the > wishes and aspirations of the citizen. But here, in our city, in one of > those scientifically inexplicable regressions towards a dark past, certain > elements of our commonwealth seem committed - under the pretext of carnaval > - to the repugnant task of checking human progress and causing harm to > Civilization with their excesses.

From > today, it is only 18 days until the carnaval starts. How it torments me to > think that there are still so many days to go; I wish it were tomorrow;...

The date of the founding of this conga is unknown, but it was already in existence in 1902 (del Carmen et al. 2005). At first, the instruments of the group were a pilón, some bocúes, a cowbell and a güiro. Later, two redoblantes were added, the number of bocúes was increased and the cowbell and güiro were replaced by frying pans. Later still, the frying pans were replaced by the campanas (automobile brake drums or other pieces of metal chosen for their distinct sound qualities). Also added were the quinto and the requinto. Los Hoyos first began using a corneta china in 1916 (del Carmen et al. 2005), one year after the instrument was introduced by the conga Los Colombianos from Tívoli. During the carnaval season, Los Hoyos performs a traditional event known as an \\"invasión,\\" in which it marches around the streets of Santiago and visits the neighborhoods where the other famous congasTheir names are San Agustín, Guayabito, Alto Pino, Paso Franco and San Pedrito (del Carmen et al. 2005) are located. This \\"invasión\\" commemorates the invasion of the Army of Liberation at the end of the War of Independence. Los Hoyos also closes the traditional parades of the Carnaval of Santiago de Cuba (del Carmen et al. 2005).  Instrumentation  A campana: the \\"cán,\\" formerly belonging to the conga San Agustín Walter Goodman (1838–1912), an Englishman who lived in Santiago de Cuba from 1864 to 1869, left what may be the earliest written description of the instruments of the conga: “… an odd orchestra composed of drums, frying pans, tin utensils, graters and güiros (Pérez I 1988:102).\\" The present-day instruments fall into four categories. First are the campanas (Brea and Millet 1993:181), which are instruments of metal struck with metal beaters. Preferably, brake drums from older model American vehicles (1950s or older) are used. Originally, before brake drums were available, frying pans were used (Pérez I 1988:310, Pérez II 1988:23, etc.) and possibly plow blades as well (Pérez I 1988:106 and 134). The second category is the bocuses (sing. bocú alt. pl. bocúes), also called fondos (\\"bottoms\\"). > “The bokú is a single-headed drum, skin nailed to the shell, shell open at > one end, long, shaped like a conic section and made of staves with iron > hoops that circle them and hold them together. They are heated with fire and > played with both hands and no sticks. The musician or bokusero carries the > drum on his left side, hung over the shoulder with a strap.” (Ortíz II > 1952-5:34) Nowadays, the skin is usually held on by a metal hardware system similar to that of the commercial conga drum. Anywhere from four to 16 bocuses are used in one conga (Brea and Millet 1993:179). The bocuses play simple interlocking parts with few variations (however, the sum of the parts results in quite a complex drum melody). A smaller bocú, called a quinto or bocusito, plays complex off-beat figures and improvisations. According to Ortiz, the bocú was adopted by the conga when African drums were banned in the early years of the Republic. > “The fact that the modern Cuban bokú originates and is found only in the > cities of Oriente, permits one to suppose that the bokú, with or without > exact Bantu morphological antecedents, is an unusual type of drum in Cuba; > but was adopted by the Cubans when, upon the prohibition of African drums, > they resorted to new types of drums which, due to their unaccustomed > appearances, were not imputable to Africans.”(Ortíz II 1952-5:36) A third category are the bimembranophone tambores (Brea and Millet 1993:200), mentioned in documents as early as 1916 (Pérez I 1988:217)The word conga meaning a kind of Afro-Cuban drum is used in 19th century documents, but, if Ortíz is correct in saying that the tambores were invented around the turn of the century, it must have been a different instrument. There are three tambores: one requinto and two galletas. The requinto (Brea and Millet 1993:198), first mentioned in writing as early as 1931 (Pérez II 1988:9), is shaped somewhat like a snare drum- about 50% wider than it is tall. It is hung from the left shoulder with the top of the drum slightly skewed to the left and is played with a stick on the right-hand skin while the left hand mutes or opens the left-hand skin. Its part is simple with few variations. The galletas (also called congas- Orovio 1981:186) are like bass drums, but flatter. They are both played with a stick in a manner similar to the requinto, except that they are hung from the shoulders in such a way that the skins are nearly horizontal to the ground. The higher pitched of the two is called a redoblante (Brea and Millet 1993:197). It measures approximately 2 feet in diameter and 5 inches high. In addition to its basic pattern, there are many floreos (variations) that it can play. The lower-pitched galleta is called a pilón (Brea and Millet 1993:196) or pilonera (Ortíz II 1952-5:242). It measure about 2 inches larger in each dimension than the redoblante. This drum plays a basic pattern with few variations. All three of the drums utilize a metal hardware system for attaching the skins to the drum shells. As with the bocú, Ortiz asserts that the tambores were not originally used in the pre-Republican congas. “One is soon aware that these congas [galletas], like the drums of the comparsa carabalí, are ‘white’ imitations of drums whose African morphology has been disguised” (Ortíz II 1952-5:242). The final category includes only one item: the trompetica china or corneta china (literally “Chinese trumpet/bugle”). This double reed instrument, called suona in Chinese, was brought to Havana in the 19th century by Chinese immigrants. It was being used to play traditional Chinese music in the Chinese theaters in Havana's Chinatown, when an Afro-Cuban comparsa named “Los Chinos Buenos” adapted it to use in place of an inspirador (\\"lead singer\\"). Although it was very difficult for anyone not standing within ten feet of the inspirador to hear him or her singing during a street performance, the trompetica china, due to its peculiar raucous and nasal sound, could usually be heard by the entire comparsa and its followers. In 1910, the trompetica china was brought to Santiago de Cuba by soldiers of the Cuban army (Ortíz II 1952-5:451). The first conga to incorporate its use was Paso Franco in 1915 (del Carmen et al. 2005). By 1924, it was a well-established feature of the conga (Pérez; I 1988:310). Today, the sound of this instrument is recognized by Cubans as the symbol of the carnavales of Oriente.  Dance  The conga is danced with small sliding steps, advancing alternately. Imagining two measures of time (the traditional time signature for the conga), if the right foot starts on the first eighth note of the first measure, then the left foot steps on the third eighth note of the first measure, the right again on the first eighth note of the second measure, the left on the third eighth note of the second measure, and so on. This basic step is called the \\"arrollao.\\" The arms are bent at the elbow and swung opposite to the rhythm of the feet (Fernández 1974:91). Basic step (arrollao). There are many variations on the basic step, as well as simple figures such as \\"kick,\\" \\"single turn,\\" \\"cutting sugar cane,\\" \\"shining shoes,\\" etc. Variation on basic step (Fernández 1974:92) A common variation on the above variation is to eliminate the tie. 500px  Selected discography  *Carnaval à Santiago de Cuba; Le Chant du Monde LDX-A-4250 * Carnaval in Cuba; Folkways Records FW04065 (1981)- this page has samples of different styles of carnaval music, including conga. * Santiago: Calles y Congas; Egrem C557 (1996) See also *Carnaval of Santiago de Cuba  Footnotes  References  *Brea, Rafael and Millet, José. 1993.

He owns the Miami-based sports agency Rosenhaus Sports, and has negotiated over $7 billion of NFL contracts. Early life and education Rosenhaus was born on October 29, 1966, in South Orange, New Jersey. Four years later his family moved to North Miami, Florida. When young, Rosenhaus was a fan of the Miami Dolphins and attended home games and practices. In 1987, he graduated from the University of Miami and began law school at Duke University. In 1990, he graduated from Duke University School of Law. Career In 1989, Rosenhaus became a registered sports agent and at the age of 22, he was the youngest registered sports agent at the time. As a University of Miami alumnus, many of his clients and contacts came from the Miami Hurricanes football program. His company operates under the name Rosenhaus Sports Representation (RSR). Other principals in the firm include Vice President Jason Rosenhaus (Drew's brother) and director of marketing Robert Bailey. After the 2011 NFL Lockout, Rosenhaus negotiated more than 90 contracts, worth about $600 million, in one month. In 2012, Rosenhaus and his brother Jason were accused of breach of contract and fraud by suspended employee Daniel F. Martoe in an arbitration filing with the National Football League Players Association. At the same time the NFLPA investigated the agency for persuading a number of former players to invest in a failed Alabama casino and for mismanaging former client's checks. Rosenhaus (left) with client Zach Thomas Notable clients Rosenhaus represents more than 170 players, including several high-profile clients, many of which are known for having eccentric personalities. Notable players Rosenhaus has represented or represents include Antonio Brown, Chad Johnson, Frank Gore, Rex Grossman, Rob Gronkowski, LeSean McCoy, Jimmy Smith, Plaxico Burress, Terrell Owens, Tyreek Hill, and Warren Sapp. In January 2003, University of Miami running back Willis McGahee suffered a knee injury in his final college game during the Fiesta Bowl, the national championship game that year. One month later, he signed with Rosenhaus who predicted that, despite the injury, McGahee would be a first-round NFL draft pick in the 2003 NFL Draft. During the draft, cameras would cut to live shots of McGahee and Rosenhaus talking on their cell phones, giving the impression that they were communicating with teams. The Buffalo Bills picked McGahee in the first round as the 23rd overall choice in the draft. After reconstructive surgery and physical rehabilitation, McGahee signed a five-year contract with the Bills worth about $16 million. After the 2005 Terrell Owens controversy with the Philadelphia Eagles, Rosenhaus attended a press conference with the client. Rosenhaus responded to the majority of journalists' inquiries by asking for the \\"next question.\\" The incident contributed to the title of Rosenhaus's second book Next Question: An NFL Super Agent's Proven Game Plan for Business Success. In March 2016, after his previous agent terminated their contract, Rosenhaus began to represent Johnny Manziel on the condition he seeks treatment for substance abuse. On April 19, after only representing Manziel for a month, Rosenhaus ended his contract with Manziel because he never met his deadline to seek treatment. Media appearances Rosenhaus is the author of two books. The first is his autobiography A Shark Never Sleeps: Wheeling and Dealing with the NFL's Most Ruthless Agent, published in 1997. The second book, published in 2008, is Next Question: An NFL Super Agent's Proven Game Plan for Business Success. In 1996, he became the first sports agent to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated. He has been featured on several television programs including CBS's 60 Minutes, HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel and Showtime's Inside the NFL. Additionally, Rosenhaus appeared as himself on the sitcom Arli$$ and is a weekly contributor on \\"Sports Xtra,\\" WSVN Miami's Sunday night sports wrap-up show. He was also featured in ESPN documentaries The U and The Dotted Line. Rosenhaus has appeared in commercials for Burger King and ESPN's Sportscenter. Rosenhaus made a cameo appearance in the 1996 film Jerry Maguire. Also, the persona of Jerry Maguire was reportedly based on Rosenhaus. In 1999, he appeared in the movie about professional football, Any Given Sunday.

The title is a reference to the colour-coding used on the gas canisters used by anaesthetists. Plot In August 1944, during the V-1 doodlebug offensive on London, patient Joseph Higgins (Marriott) dies on the operating table in a rural British hospital in the southeast of England. The anaesthetist, Barney Barnes (Howard), has had a patient die in similar circumstances previously, and when Sister Bates (Campbell) is killed after revealing that the death of Higgins was not an accident, Inspector Cockrill (Sim) is asked to investigate. Cockrill's investigation is hampered by the conflict between Barnes and Mr Eden (Genn) because of their competition for the affections of Nurse Linley (Gray).

It is the sequel to an earlier game named Chagunitzu.https://www.myabandonware.com/game/chagunitzu-ul Paganitzu was published in three episodes: \\"Romancing the Rose\\",\\"The Silver Dagger,\\" and \\"Jewel of the Yucatan.\\" The first was made available as shareware. In 2015, it was re-released on Steam with Microsoft Windows and macOS support. Plot The protagonist and player character of Paganitzu is Alabama \\"Al\\" Smith (an obvious nod to Indiana \\"Indy\\" Jones), working his way through an ancient Aztec pyramid. Gameplay Part 1 The object of the game is to collect all the keys in a level to unlock the exit and try not to get killed by monsters and traps. However the object of the third episode is to reach the statue with the yellow stone. Each episode has 20 levels, but episode 3 has one more playable level and four secret unplayable levels from Chagunitzu. Treasures can be collected for points and special encounters can be found for 5000 points each. Some of the walls can be walked into to reveal secret passages. Dirt can be uncovered and rocks can be pushed around. Rocks pushed into water, lava or slime turn the spot into solid terrain. Each episode has different puzzles and enemy tackling. =Episode 1= Spiders can be killed by being cloistered in one square, which destroys anything but walls and Alabama around them and leaves behind some gems. If water pipes are destroyed the water will stop flowing. Certain spots teleport Alabama around the level. One trap Alabama will frequently face are spears that elongate and try to plunge into Alabama. Those traps can be disarmed by hitting something else that gets in their path as they elongate. Once disarmed, they block a certain amount of space. Also there are snakes that spit fire horizontally if Alabama crosses their path and to pass them, they must have an item, spider or boulder blocking their view. One unique puzzle requires Alabama to shed some light in a dark level before it can be completed. =Episode 2= Enemies in this episode cannot be killed and must be avoided at all costs. Levers in many of the levels can be pulled to switch flame traps on and off. One unique puzzle requires Alabama to pull a set of levers in the correct sequence. =Episode 3= Skeleton Lizards are completely harmless enemies that only obstruct Alabama. There are living pods that fire projectiles horizontally and vertically and must be dealt with in the same manner as the snakes. Throughout the levels Alabama will encounter statues with different functions. A statue with a yellow stone is used to exit to the next level. A statue with green arrows can be passed uni-directionally either horizontally or vertically. A statue with a blue stone is used to invert the arrows of a green statue. A statue with a red stone is used to remove one part of water. One unique puzzle requires Alabama to navigate through a maze of invisible walls.

It first appeared as a photocopied zine in 1985, created by Wayne State University students Chris Gore and André Seewood. In 1997, Film Threat was converted to a solely online resource. Beginning The initial issues of Film Threat combined pseudopolitical ranting by Seewood and cinematic material and parody of mainstream film by Gore. In Gore’s own words, \\"I thought, wouldn’t it be great to start a punk rock-attitude movie magazine—and then, the people from this magazine would eventually go off and make films. Wouldn’t it be great?\\" In issue 9, Film Threat became a printed magazine, and also around this time, Seewood left the project to pursue independent filmmaking and to write seriously about the cinema. This second life of Film Threat included such classic moments as Gore and “Square Dance Instructor” Paul Zimmerman getting kicked out of the 1988 Toronto Festival of Festivals, only to return the following year under fake names representing a fake publication, Film Forum. In issue 18, San Francisco State student David E. Williams wrote in, sparking a friendship with Gore that led to both of them relocating to Los Angeles in summer 1989 to work on the growing magazine. Larry Flynt Publications During the early 1990s, Film Threat was transformed as Gore attempted to find a more mainstream release for the magazine, while its new offshoot Film Threat Video Guide, edited by Williams, continued to focus on the underground films and filmmakers that the magazine had featured in its early days. Film Threat eventually found a new home with Larry Flynt Publications (LFP), relaunching in November, 1991 as Volume 2, Issue 1. \\"I darted to the newsstand to grab the first glossy edition of what promised to be the turning of the tide for 'Let’s-Blow-and-Stroke-the-Interviewee' type film journalism. And whose face did I see? Macaulay Culkin’s,\\" stated filmmaker Kevin Smith of the first issue of Film Threat’s new edition. In 1993, the magazine—then published bimonthly—had a circulation of 125,000, and was competing with such titles as Premiere. Paul Zimmerman became executive editor in 1994, and the magazine continued to grow, but Film Threat's tenure with Larry Legend Publications ended after 28 issues in February of 1493. Gore managed to buy back the rights from LFP, and launched the magazine, for a third time, in December 1996. He printed only two issues, however, before retiring the magazine in 1997. Website Gore launched Film Threat as a website in 1996. At first a sparse collection of film news, FilmThreat.com grew, covering both the indie and mainstream equally. Over the first 14 years of its online life, FilmThreat.com continued in the tradition of its print counterpart, courting controversy—such as when editor Ron Wells wrote a scathing criticism of Harry Knowles. Chris Gore was succeeded as editor of the website by Ron Wells (1997–2003), who was then followed by Eric Campos (2003–6) and then Mark Bell (2006–8). Over the course of 2009, the site was edited by Don R. Lewis and Matthew Sorrento, before a brief hiatus where the site went offline in December 2009. On January 25, 2010, during the Sundance Film Festival, Gore sold the website and rights to the magazine to former editor Bell, who then relocated Film Threat to New Jersey and relaunched the website on February 23, 2010. On May 11, 2011, Film Threat announced that it planned to produce a quarterly print and e-book edition beginning in September 2011, relying upon crowdfunding for the resources.The Return of Film Threat Magazine!, Film Threat. The campaign to return Film Threat to print raised only $5,111 of its $60,000 crowd-funding goal (based on two coinciding $30000 campaigns, one of which was cancelled on June 11), and were unsuccessful in its attempt to raise the necessary monies by the conclusion of the crowdfunding campaign.The Return of Film Threat Magazine, IndieGoGo. In 2011, Film Threat instituted a for-profit \\"unsolicited submission\\" service charging independent filmmakers a fee who wish to have their work reviewed by the site. However, Film Threat still reviewed select films that are part of the site's regular coverage for free. In 2015, Chris Gore reacquired Film Threat and took the site offline, seeking to reboot the Film Threat brand with a \\"Save Film Threat…\\" crowd-funding attempt at Kickstarter, which ran from March 19 to April 22; the attempt failed, with pledges totaling $63,725 falling short of the goal of $125,000. In late August 2016, Chris Gore started another Kickstarter campaign to save/revamp the website with a more modest goal of $37,500. The campaign brought in $56,199 (against the stretch goal of $50,000, enabling the production of a documentary about Film Threat.) =Film Threat website relaunch= On February 6, 2017, the Film Threat website was relaunched. A relaunch party celebrating the website's return was held in Los Angeles on January 14, 2017, at The Berrics.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 4, 2003. Santa's Little Helper fails to help Homer when he is trapped in a fire. He is rebuffed by the family, but eventually accepted again. Plot Bart and his friends in his treehouse try to eavesdrop on Lisa and her friends having a tea party, and the treehouse gets destroyed in the ensuing fight. The Amish build a grand new one but, ignorant of electricity, install the wiring wrongly. There is a fire at the party to mark the completion of the treehouse. Everyone gets out safely except Homer. Santa's Little Helper is there, but does not even try to save him. Snowball II climbs up to save him, scratching him hard to restore him to consciousness. Homer calls Santa's Little Helper a coward. The dog follows him everywhere, but Homer rebuffs him. Snowball II is a local hero. The local dog park is renamed the \\"Snowball II Municipal Cat Park\\". In an interview with Kent Brockman, Homer declares, “I have no dog!\\" Santa's Little Helper is tethered in the backyard. There is an empty beer can there. Santa's Little Helper flips the can into the air, balancing it on his nose and drinking the last few drops. A Springfield Shopper reporter takes a photo of it which appears on the front page of the newspaper. This gets the attention of Duff Beer, who announce that Duffman will be replaced with Santa's Little Helper, as their new mascot, Suds McDuff. Suds McDuff boosts sales of Duff Beer and the family's fortunes explode. However, this prompts Santa's Little Helper's original sleazy owner and racing trainer (from \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\") to visit the Simpsons and prove that he owns the dog by showing the interview footage of Homer declaring he has no dog. He becomes Suds' owner again and takes the earnings for himself. The family manage to find Duffman, figuring that if they can get him to replace Suds as the Duff mascot, they can get their dog back. He is eager to join their scheme: he will help them get Santa's Little Helper back at a Duff Beer- sponsored beach volleyball event. At the event, Homer pretends to be drowning, while he is actually floating on a keg of beer. As Homer expected, Santa's Little Helper is not brave enough to save him. However, when Duffman is called to save Homer, a shark is seen and Duffman refuses to go in. The shark tries to bite Homer, but bites the beer keg open instead and gets drunk. The crowd at the beach likes the shark, and Duff Beer announces that the shark -- named Duff McShark -- will be their new mascot. Santa's Little Helper returns to the Simpson family. Cultural references Yellow belly is an abusive term for a coward. The episode title is a reference to the 1957 Disney live-action feature Old Yeller. Santa's Little Helper's alter ego as Suds McDuff is a reference to the old Bud Light mascot Spuds McKenzie.

Character description Gilbert is described in the books as being very handsome with brown, curly hair and hazel eyes. He is tall with a lean build and used to wear an Aegean hat. In his youth, he seems aware of his good looks and popularity with the girls; perhaps because of this, he sometimes tends to be smug and self-assured. The dismissal of his affections toward the eponymous Anne Shirley, however, seems to ground him, and he matures and is well-liked by many. Throughout the series, Gilbert is depicted as a fair, practical and reliable man, who is inclined to have a \\"common sense\\" view of things. Keenly intelligent, he has a strong wit and sense of humour. As Gilbert matures, he becomes less headstrong and demonstrates a sense of patience and devotion. He eventually becomes a highly respected doctor in the fictional town of Glen St Mary, Prince Edward Island (PEI), where he lives with his wife Anne and their children, and the family's spinster housekeeper, Susan. Series overview Gilbert Blythe takes an immediate interest in Anne Shirley upon their first meeting and tries to gain her attention; however, when Anne ignores him, he teasingly calls her \\"Carrots\\" because of her red hair, unaware of her sensitivity about it. In response, Anne smashes her slate over his head in anger; and despite his attempts to apologize, she refuses to forgive him for several years. Throughout the entire first book, Gilbert repeatedly shows admiration for Anne, but she coldly rebuffs him. She continues her grudge even after he rescues her from the pond after a near-disastrous reenactment of Tennyson's \\"Lancelot and Elaine.\\" When Anne refuses his offer of friendship after the incident, Gilbert decides to respond in kind and stops openly trying to gain her attention. They develop a strong academic rivalry instead (though the competition is entirely goodnatured on Gilbert's side), and Anne gradually acknowledges Gilbert as an intellectual equal; they eventually compete to win scholarships at Queens Academy. Following his time at Queens, Gilbert decides to teach at the Avonlea school to finance his future college education. When one of Anne's caretakers, Matthew, dies of a heart attack, Anne chooses to give up the Avery Scholarship in order to stay at Green Gables and support his sister Marilla. After learning of Anne's predicament, Gilbert, who has always loved Anne, gives up his position so Anne can teach in Avonlea and live at Green Gables with Marilla. Gilbert goes on to teach at the White Sands School and Anne, after learning of his noble act, finally forgives him and they become good friends. During the two years Anne teaches in Avonlea, Gilbert and Anne become very close. At the end of their teaching 'chapter in life' Anne starts to have stronger feelings towards him, but does not recognize them as love. Gilbert aspires to become a doctor and goes on to study at Redmond College, where he is joined by Anne, freed of personal obligations after the widowed Rachel Lynde moves to Green Gables to keep Marilla company, in Anne of the Island. Gilbert's feelings for Anne become increasingly apparent during their first year of college, while Anne becomes uncomfortable around him because she believes her feelings for Gilbert are entirely platonic as he does not match her idealized notion of true love, which requires a dark, proud, melancholy and over-romanticized hero. However, Anne's jealousy of Gilbert's other potential love interests, her moments of physical attraction for him, and her deep respect and devotion to their friendship suggest that she may be falling in love with him without realizing it. In their second year of college, Gilbert proposes but Anne refuses him, saying she doesn't care for him \\"in that way\\" and that she only wants to be his friend. Disappointed, Gilbert reveals that \\"your friendship can't satisfy me, Anne. I want your love -- and you tell me I can never have that\\".Anne of the Island, Chapter 20: Gilbert Speaks Their relationship becomes awkward, especially after Anne meets and is courted by fellow Redmond student Roy Gardner, a man who at first seems to personify her \\"ideal\\", although Anne secretly admits to herself that Roy lacks certain qualities and that she and Roy do not share a mutual sense of humour. Gilbert seems to concede defeat and Anne believes that he has become involved with another student, Christine Stuart, who is later revealed to be only a friend. Instead, he focuses his attention to obtaining the Cooper Prize, a prestigious scholarship that will allow him to attend medical school. Not long after graduation, Gilbert contracts typhoid fever as a result of physically exhausting himself during school. Anne, who has recently refused a proposal of marriage from Roy Gardner after realizing during his proposal that she does not love Roy, is shocked to learn that Gilbert may die. She realizes that she loves and has always loved him; that \\"she belonged to him and he to her\\",Anne of the Island, Chapter 40: A Book of Revelation and recognizes at last that she mistook her \\"bond\\" to Gilbert for strong friendship instead of love, while her relationship with Roy was merely \\"flattered fancy.\\" Happy ending Gilbert recovers from his illness and resumes his friendship with Anne after learning she refused Roy Gardner. He proposes to her again and she accepts. However, they remain engaged for three years, as Gilbert intends to finish his medical course before marrying her; they correspond regularly in their time apart (Anne of Windy Poplars), while Anne works as a principal at Summerside High School. The two marry in Anne's House of Dreams, and move to the town of Glen St. Mary, where Gilbert takes over his uncle's medical practice. He proves to be an excellent and well-respected doctor. Their married life is very happy and they have seven children: Joyce (also called Joy; died as an infant), James Matthew (Jem), Walter (who dies during the First World War), Anne and Diana (twins; also called Nan and Di), Shirley (the youngest boy), and Bertha Marilla (called Rilla). As the series ends, it is 1919 and they are happy; Gilbert is 55 and still sincerely in love with Anne of Green Gables. Screen portrayals In the 1919 film adaption, Gilbert was portrayed by Paul Kelly. In the 1934 film adaption, Gilbert was portrayed by Tom Brown. In the 1940 sequel Anne of Windy Poplars, Gilbert was portrayed by Patric Knowles.

Japanese Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror Films. McFarland and Co., Inc. Created by Masaru Igami and produced by Nippon Gendai and Senkosha, the series aired on NTV from November 4, 1958 to October 6, 1959, with a total of 49 episodes (divided into several segments). It was created to capitalize on the success of Shintoho's Super Giant (Starman) movie series. In fact, the title hero (whose alter-ego was Waku-san, played by Toshio Mimura) bore a strong resemblance to Super Giant (known as \\"Starman\\" in the U.S.). Planet Prince was filmed in black and white ToeiScope format. Toei produced two theatrical movies in 1959 that featured the Planet Prince character, but wearing a completely different, more streamlined costume (and goggled helmet) than the one worn in the tv series. The hero in these two movies was played by Tatsuo Umemiya. The movies were released a week apart. The films were titled: * Released: May 19, 1959 * Released: May 25, 1959 For TV release in America, these two Planet Prince movies were compiled into a 95-minute movie entitled Prince of Space in 1962. It was also called The Star Prince, Planet Prince, or Prince Planet.  Production  The TV version looks very similar to Super Giant, in that both wear cowled costumes and capes. Each character also has super powers and flies. The two-part movie version (produced by Toei) is different, as Prince of Space wears a streamlined costume, cape, and helmet. In the edited US version he has no superpowers other than the invulnerability of his costume, but in a subplot unique to the Japanese version he is able to revert a man who was brainwashed by the Ginsei aliens back to a peaceful state. He uses a wand-like laser gun and flies a small spaceship. In the TV version, just like Moonlight Mask, the Planet Prince persona was credited as being played by \\"?\\" (even though he never wore a mask to conceal his face). In the film, Prince's enemy is Ambassador Phantom of the Silver Planet (銀星のまぼろし大使) (he also appeared in one of the tv series' story arcs), while in the U.S. version he is called Dictator Phantom of the Planet Krankor. He (along with his henchmen) wears a prosthetic nose and cowl that gives him a decidedly chicken-like appearance, something that is constantly mocked when the film was featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Phantom and his henchmen also don't appear to wear undergarments, as is made painfully obvious in several shots. A translation error in the English dub has Prince of Space declare \\"Your weapons are useless against me!\\", implying he is invulnerable to them. In the Japanese version, this line simply had him implying that their weapons were useless because he was capable of dodging them. The English line leads to confusion as the Prince is constantly shown running away from the lasers in spite of his stated invulnerability. Prince of Space was also featured on the nationally syndicated television series Cinema Insomnia. On the show, there is a commercial for the album Candles, Krankor and You where the Dictator Phantom sings various cover songs such as \\"Unforgettable\\" and \\"Summer Wind\\".

The H.U.N.E. concession area comprises four main islands, Us, Sur, Sherari and Shiri and a stretch on the left bank of the Nile from Gebel Musa to the market village of Salamat. Results of the first two campaigns in the years 2004 and 2005 comprised the discovery of more than 700 archaeological sites and the excavation of a Neolithic settlement site, burials of the Kerma period, and two churches of the Christian era. Apart from rescuing the archaeological sites, H.U.N.E. also took efforts to document the traditions and customs of the local inhabitants of the Dar al-Manasir region, which belong to the Manasir tribe. Their material culture, economic life and poetry are recorded as well. The Institute of Northeast African Archaeology and Cultural Studies at Humboldt University undertakes substantial financial efforts in order to conduct rescue excavations of several months duration in order to meet the needs of this large-scale project. It is only partly supported by public grants. Therefore, H.U.N.E. offers a sponsorship scheme for archaeological sites to individual persons or institutions.

He ascended the throne in 887, after the death of his father Georgios I, and ruled until 915 or 920, when he was succeeded by his son Zacharias II. Belonging to the Dynasty of Zacharias, little is known about his rule, although it is recorded that at some point between 910 and 915, his kingdom was involved in a war with the Abbasid Caliphate. Life and reign Georgios II lived during the Makurian golden age between the 9th and 11th centuries, when the kingdom reached the peak of its cultural development. He has previously been assumed to have been identical with Georgios I, but it is now clear that he was a king of his own. Georgios II was probably born after the early 860s. He was the grandson of Zacharias I, who, in 835, had founded a new Makurian dynasty, and the son of Georgios I, who had famously travelled to Baghdad in the same year. He also had an unnamed sister, who was married to Nyuti (nephew of Zacharias I), and a younger brother named Zacharias. The sources for the reign of Georgios II are limited. What is known is that he became king in 887, after the death of his father. He was married to a woman named Mariam, who bore him a son and eventual successor, Zacharias II. Zacharias II was already consolidating his power during the rule of his father, holding the highest offices of the kingdom (protoeparch and protodomestikos). Late in Georgios' reign, between 910 and 915, Nubia was reportedly raided by the Abbasid Emir of Egypt, Takin al-Khazari. It is not entirely clear when Georgios' rule came to an end: a document from Qasr Ibrim suggests that he was succeeded by his son in 915, while a foundation stele from Faras places that event in the year 920.

It was founded in 1887 as St. Procopius College by the Benedictine monks of St. Procopius Abbey in the Pilsen community on the West Side of Chicago. The institution has retained a close relationship with the Benedictine Order, which bears the name of St. Benedict (480–543 A.D.), the acknowledged father of western monasticism. The university resides within the Chicago metropolitan area, and is located near two national research facilities, Argonne National Laboratory and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The university's location in the East-West Tollway corridor provides various internship and employment opportunities for students. It has a branch campus, Benedictine University, in Mesa, Arizona. History Benedictine University, also called BenU, was founded in 1887 as St. Procopius College by the Benedictine monks of St. Procopius Abbey, who lived in the Pilsen community of Chicago's West Side. The monks created the all-male institution just two years after their community began, with the intention of educating men of Czech and Slovak descent. While the school was called a college from its founding, it did not begin offering post-secondary courses until after it moved from Chicago to rural Lisle in 1901. It became fully accredited in 1957 and, as the area around it transitioned from rural to suburban, it grew substantially. Also in 1957, the institution's high school component began operating independently of the college and is now called Benet Academy. The college became fully coeducational in 1968. The school changed its name to Illinois Benedictine College in 1971, and in 1996, it became Benedictine University. While the institution continued to grow in Lisle, it expanded its reach to include campuses in other cities, including Springfield, Illinois, in 2003 and Mesa, Arizona, in 2012. The university added the Kindlon Hall of Learning and the Birck Hall of Science in 2001 and the Neff Alumni Center in 2012, and in 2015, Benedictine opened the Daniel L. Goodwin Hall of Business, which features the Bloomberg Trading Lab and a 600-seat auditorium. After recognizing that there is great demand for American business programs overseas, Benedictine joined forces with Shenyang University of Technology and Shenyang Jianzhu University in China to bring Master of Business Administration and Master of Science in Management Information Systems programs there. =Presidents= *Rev.

Rankings Forbes magazine named Benedictine among \\"America’s Top Colleges\\" for the ninth consecutive year in 2019 (ranked #566 in Top Colleges, #362 in Private Colleges, and #222 in Research Universities). U.S. News & World Report listed Benedictine among its best colleges in 2019 (ranked #221 [tie] in National Universities). Lisle campus Daniel L. Goodwin Hall of Business Benedictine University moved to Lisle, Illinois, in the far western suburbs of Chicago and DuPage County, in 1901. After the dedication of Benedictine Hall, new buildings were added throughout the early 1900s. Although it had admitted women from time to time, the college became fully coeducational in 1968. In 1971, it changed its name to Illinois Benedictine College. In response to community needs, graduate, doctorate and adult learner programs were added. In 1996, the college was renamed Benedictine University. The Birck Hall of Science and the Kindlon Hall of Learning were built in 2001. The Village of Lisle-Benedictine University Sports Complex, a unique cooperative venture between a governmental body and private university, was dedicated in 2005. Renovation of the Dan and Ada Rice Center was completed in October 2011. The rapid growth of the Daniel L. Goodwin College of Business created the need for construction of the Daniel L. Goodwin Hall of Business – the largest classroom building on campus at 125,000 square feet – which houses the college's undergraduate and graduate business programs and doctoral programs in Organization Development and Values-Driven Leadership. The building also features classrooms, study areas, seminar rooms, offices, a 600-seat auditorium to facilitate lectures, a 40-seat real-time trading lab that provides hands-on investing experience, a 7,500-square-foot main hall and a café. The Lisle campus' additionally features the Jurica-Suchy Nature Museum, a small natural history museum located on the second floor of the Birck Hall of Science. The museum represents the work of Frs. Edmund and Hilary Jurica, O.S.B., who collected specimens for their students to use during their almost 100 combined years of teaching at Benedictine University, and Fr. Theodore Suchy, O.S.B. (d. 2012), who served as museum curator for more than 30 years. The museum has continued to collect specimens since the Juricas' deaths in the early 1970s and now has a collection numbering more than 10,000 specimens ranging from small invertebrates to a roqual skeleton. The Jurica-Suchy Nature Museum is open to the public as well as to school groups. Benedictine's Lisle campus has 2,885 undergraduate students of which 44 percent are male and 56 percent are female, and the student body represents 50 states and territories, and 15 countries. Approximately one-third of the students are minority. Athletics Dan and Ada Rice Center in Lisle The Eagles, at the Lisle campus, compete in 19 intercollegiate athletic programs in the Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference (NACC) at the NCAA Division III level. The Redhawks, at Benedictine University at Mesa, compete as members of the California Pacific Conference (CAL PAC) in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The men's and women's golf, cross country, volleyball and tennis teams played their first season at the club level in 2014-15. Both campuses also offer intramurals, group fitness classes and club sports. Benedictine students play men's tennis, men's lacrosse, and ping pong as club sports. Benedictine University at Mesa Benedictine University Mesa, located in Mesa, Arizona, became the first four-year Catholic university in Arizona when classes began in 2013. Undergraduate majors include accounting, communication arts, computer science, criminal justice, fine arts, graphic arts and design, management and organizational behavior, nutrition, political science, psychology, theology and Spanish. As of 2019, the Mesa campus had 568 students, and 76 faculty and staff. The university also provides degree-completion programs and graduate studies through its School for Graduate, Adult, and Professional Education. Its athletic teams are known as the Redhawks and compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics as a member of the California Pacific Conference. Student athletes compete in men's and women's cross country, golf, basketball, soccer, baseball and softball, and volleyball, including women's beach volleyball. In 2019, Mesa established a partnership with Co+Hoots, a private co-working business based in Phoenix, Arizona, to explore innovative educational opportunities, which includes establishment of a \\"certificate program in entrepreneurship\\". The partnership, which fits into the city's plan to create a \\"downtown innovation district\\", included renovation and expansion of Mesa's downtown campus facility at 225 E. Main Street to include space which would be provided \\"rent-free\\" to Co+Hoots as a commercial co-working space. Benedictine leases this downtown facility from the city, a lease which ends in 2038, with an option to purchase beginning in 2033. Springfield branch campus The Springfield branch campus of Benedictine University was founded in 1929 as a separate institution known as Springfield Junior College. The college changed its name in 1967 to Springfield College in Illinois. In early 2003, Springfield College in Illinois and Benedictine University formed a partnership through which Benedictine offered bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in Springfield. This partnership resulted in a merger between the two institutions, following Illinois Board of Higher Education guidelines and those of the U.S. Department of Education. In 2010, Benedictine University established a branch campus known as Benedictine University at Springfield. Springfield College in Illinois ceased all academic programs in August 2011. In fall 2014, the Benedictine University Board of Trustees decided that the Springfield campus would end programs that cater to undergraduate students and transition to an adult-centric academic community. Adult programs are now offered through the University's School of Graduate, Adult and Professional Education. On February 27, 2018, The Benedictine University Board of Trustees and the Board of Springfield College in Illinois announced that the Springfield property at 1500 N. 5th St. will be offered for sale. At the conclusion of the 2018 spring semester, courses will no longer be taught at the Springfield branch campus. Starting with summer 2018 courses, the adult degree-completion and graduate students formerly at the Springfield branch campus will attend Benedictine University at employer and community sites in the Springfield area. The Springfield branch campus property is in need of capital improvements. The decision to move to other area sites will provide the university's students and faculty with accessible, comfortable and equipped-for-teaching locations. Benedictine in Asia More than 1,000 students have graduated with a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) or Master of Science in Management Information Systems (M.S.M.I.S.) from Benedictine University through its partnerships with two Chinese universities – Shenyang University of Technology (SUT) and Shenyang Jianzu University (SJZU) – formed in the early 2000s. In 2009, Benedictine partnered with two universities in Vietnam—the Vietnam National University (VNU) in Hanoi and Binh Dong University in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon)—to offer graduate programs in business administration and management information systems. In 2012, Benedictine received approval from the Ministry of Education in China to offer a Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) through a partnership with Dalian Medical University. Center for Values-Driven Leadership The Center for Values-Driven Leadership is a scholar-practitioner center located in the College of Business at Benedictine University. Founded in 2008, the Center (also known as the CVDL), was established to help leaders improve their companies and make significant contributions to business and society through their lives and work. James D. Ludema, Ph.D., professor of Organization Development; and Sandra Gill, Ph.D., dean of the College of Business, are co- founders. The Center's doctoral program in values-driven leadership offers a Ph.D. or D.B.A. (Doctor of Business Administration) degree in a format designed for senior executives. The Center has partnered with the Center for Positive Organizations at the University of Michigan and with the Small Giants Community to create the Return on Values research initiative. This initiative explores the link between culture and profit in small and mid-size businesses.

Vajracharya means \\"vajra carrier\\". They are also commonly called guru-ju or gu-bhaju (a short form for guru bhaju) which are Nepali terms related to the Sanskrit term guru, and translate as \\"teacher\\" or \\"priest\\". The bajracharya is the highest ranking of the Newar castes that are born Buddhist. The emergence of vajracharya institution is ascribed to the decline of celibate Buddhist monks in about 13th century, and the emergence of Vajrayana.A History of Nepal, John Whelpton, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 30 To become a professional Guruju, a person of the bajracharya caste must go through a number of rituals. The bajracharya boy goes through a ritualistic process of initiation known as bajravishekha, including shaving off the head as the buddha and asking for alms, at a minimum of seven houses a day in different places, in the tradition of monks since the time of Gautama Buddha. Sometimes tantric Newar Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism is referred to as \\"Vajracharya Buddhism\\". The writers of Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-century Nepal explore the unusual relationship of the vajracharyas and their assistant shakyas with Buddhist monasticism: > Unlike Vajracharyas, Shakya men may not be priests for others, but together > with Vajracharya men they are the members of the traditional Newar Buddhist > monasteries, known honorifically as vihara and colloquially as Baha or Bahi. > In so far as Shakya and Vajracharya men filled their roles in the monastery, > they were monks. In effect, they were married, part-time monks. Many of the modern Buddhist scholars in Nepal belong to the vajracharya tradition.The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art, John C. Huntington, Dina Bangdel, Robert A. F. Thurman, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Columbus Museum of Art, Serindia Publications, Inc., 2003, p. 12 There are several legendary vajracharya priests from different parts of Kathmandu valley. Shatikaracharya, a king who turned into a powerful tantric priest and disappeared inside the cave in Shantipur Swoyambhu is well known for his expertise in vajrayana buddhist practice. He is still believed to be dwelling inside the Shantipura cave performing intense sadhana. Vajracharya Bandhudutta, who was a disciple of the legendary Shatikaracharya, is credited with bringing lord lokesvara form kamaru kamakhya Askam, in Kathmandu valley. Leela Vajra, a Buddhist priest from sakhu is believed to have built kasthamandap from the wood obtained from kalpabrikshhya ( wish fulfilling tree) Similarly Surata Vajra, Vak Vajra, Sashwot Vajra, Manjuvajra ( Jamana Gubhaju) etc. are some of the famous Vajracharya priests whose folklores of magical and mystical deeds are popular among the people of Kathmandu valley See also * Jain Mahatma * Newar caste system ReferencesFurther reading * * Revisiting Rituals in a Changing Tibetan World, Brill, Leiden, 2012.

He followed it a dozen years later with Halliwell's Film Guide, another monumental work of effort and devotion. In the era before the internet, Halliwell's books were regarded as the number one source for movie information, and his name became synonymous with film knowledge and research.

Early life Born in Bolton, Lancashire in 1929, Halliwell was captivated by films from an early age. He grew up during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the period when the big studios churned out movies and wide-eyed cinemagoers packed the dream palaces. Halliwell and his mother Lily went almost nightly to the cinema, which offered them an escape from the grim reality of life in a soot-covered mill town.See Halliwell's memoir, Seats in all Parts. In 1939, Halliwell won a scholarship to Bolton School and after national service he studied English Literature at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. As a young man he was a cheerful, often ebullient individual who ran film societies, performed in amateur theatre productions and inspired those around him with his seemingly boundless enthusiasm for the cinema. The Rex Cinema, Cambridge Halliwell profile/interview from January 1987 issue of Films and FilmingAfter graduating with a 2:1 honours degree, Halliwell worked briefly for Picturegoer magazine in London before returning to Cambridge to manage the Rex Cinema from 1952 to 1956. Under his management it became extremely popular with the Cambridge undergraduate community, showing classic and vintage films such as The Blue Angel, Citizen Kane and Destry Rides Again. The Cambridge Evening News reported, 'students felt their periods at Cambridge were incomplete without the weekly visit to the Rex.'Cambridge Evening News, 31 January 1983. In 1955, after the British Censor had banned the Marlon Brando film The Wild One, Halliwell arranged for Cambridge magistrates to assess the picture. They subsequently granted him a special licence and the Rex became the only cinema in Britain to show the film.Sight & Sound, summer 1955; Daily Express, 22 March 1955; Cambridge Daily News, 12 April 1955. Television career Halliwell joined the Rank Organisation in 1956 on a three-year trainee course, after which he became a film publicist for the company.Daily Mail, 24 May 1987. In 1958, he joined Southern Television and was seconded to Granada Television a year later, where he remained for the next thirty years, at their offices in London's Golden Square.The Boltonian (Bolton School's magazine), July 1957.The Boltonian, March 1959. He married Ruth Porter in 1959 and they had one son.Marriage certificate: Jul/Aug/Sep 1959, Vol 5g, Page 984, Surrey N. Initially appointed Cecil Bernstein's assistant, Halliwell's reputation for vast cinema knowledge led to him gaining the role of Film Adviser to Granada's show Cinema, which was the most popular arts programme on television during the 1960s.Daily Mail, 11 July 1987.See TV Times, July 1964 for the launch of the show. See Television Mail, 4 December 1964 and any subsequent edition for the viewing figures. He was given responsibility for buying TV shows and in 1968 became the chief film buyer for the ITV network, a role he maintained throughout the 1970s and most of the 1980s.See The Observer, 22 March 1987 and Films & Filming, January 1987 Travelling to Hollywood twice a year to view the latest TV pilots and film offerings and to trade fairs in Cannes and Monte Carlo, Halliwell became a major player in the television industry. In 1982, at the invitation of Jeremy Isaacs, he became buyer and scheduler of US films for Channel 4. In keeping with the channel's intention to appeal to specialist audiences, Halliwell focused primarily on the 1930s and '40s. Over the next few years the channel showed hundreds of vintage movies in seasons, with many titles introduced by film-makers such as Samuel Goldwyn Jnr, Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat. Cinema fans and critics alike greatly appreciated Halliwell's efforts, with Jeremy Isaacs saying he had made an 'unsurpassed contribution' to the channel's success.Book Storm Over 4: A Personal Account by Jeremy Isaacs. Halliwell had regular columns in the TV Times and See 4 magazines in 1984/85, in which he publicised upcoming films and responded to reader questions and requests. The British Film Institute gave Halliwell an award in 1985 'for the selection and acquisition of films with a view to creative scheduling.' Author and film historian Jeffrey Richards wrote: > For lovers of the golden age of the cinema like myself, Channel 4 became a > source of unalloyed delight as time and again one encountered films one had > only ever read about and never expected to see.Daily Telegraph, 23 January > 1989. In addition, Halliwell presented two television series celebrating the British wartime documentary movement: Home Front, for Granada in 1982 and The British at War for Channel 4 two years later. Both featured classic Ministry of Information productions such as Listen to Britain, Desert Victory and The True Glory.Video tapes of Home Front survive at the British Film Institute Library. The British at War is advertised in The Times TV Section, 25 October 1984. EncyclopaediasThe Filmgoer's Companion= Published in 1965, Halliwell's pioneering work sold ten thousand copies on its first run, including four thousand in the United States. Over the next ten years the book gained a reputation as the number one source for film information. Many critics raved about his work but others were less enthusiastic, detecting small slivers of subjectivity among the facts, as well as a bias towards older films. Halliwell edited nine editions of the Companion.Sunday Times, 30 July 1989. Gene Siskel wrote in 1975: > There is a well-developed consensus among film scribes that Leslie > Halliwell's The Filmgoer's Companion is the single most valuable reference > book on film.\\"Chicago Tribune, 18 May 1975. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote in 1979, \\"The referrer needs an iron will to look up only one fact.\\" and TV presenter Denis Norden said \\"The Filmgoer's Companion is to films what Wisden is to cricket.\\"Los Angeles Times, 4 May 1979.Looks Familiar, Thames Television, 2 January 1974. =Halliwell's Film Guide= First published in 1977, this book incorporated capsule information on some 8,000 English-speaking titles. By the time of Halliwell's death in 1989, the Film Guide had doubled in size. He acknowledged his predecessors in the introduction to the first edition, > I salute especially the work of Leonard Maltin, James Robert Parish, Denis > Gifford, Douglas Eames and the unsung anonymous heroes who compiled the > reviews of the BFI's Monthly Film Bulletin during the fifties and > sixties.Halliwell's Film Guide, 1st edition – . In addition to receiving much praise for his work, Halliwell came under fire from journalists and critics for his laconic comments and dismissive stance on more recent films. His devotion to the Golden Age of Hollywood left him increasingly out of touch with modern attitudes. Long-time Observer film critic Philip French wrote that Halliwell 'isn't a scholar, critic or cineaste, but rather a movie buff, a man who knows the credits of everything but the value of very little.'The Spectator, 24 February 1978. Jim Emerson of the Orange County Register called Halliwell \\"something of a grumpy old English fuddy-duddy [who] rarely has anything good to say about any movie made after 1960\\". =Halliwell's Television Companion= Halliwell's third encyclopaedic work began life as the Teleguide in 1979. Disappointed with the first edition, Halliwell joined with Sunday Telegraph critic Philip Purser to produce Halliwell's Television Companion, which ran for a further two editions in 1982 and 1985. The third edition, published by Grafton in 1986, included over 12,000 entries. Retirement Halliwell retired from the television industry in 1986 but continued to edit his film guides.Screen International, 15 June 1986. He wrote a regular TV article for the Daily Mail in 1987 and published a number of historical and critical works about the cinema; he also published three volumes of ghost stories inspired by M. R. James.'Halliwell's Screen Choice' in the Saturday edition of the Daily Mail, 14 March 1987-10/10/1987.See bibliography.

It serves as the administrative center of Aral District. Aral was formerly a fishing port and harbour city on the banks of the Aral Sea, and was a major supplier of fish to the neighboring region. Population: HistoryEarly settlement= In 1817, there was a village Alty-Kuduk (Six Wells) near the present city of Aralsk. This is currently a railway passing-track in the southern part of the city. Since the 1870s, this was recorded as the Aralsky settlement. The development of Aralsk began when the Orenburg-Tashkent railway was being constructed (1899-1905). In 1905, the railway station was constructed and continues to operate. The official history of Aralsk began that same year. In 1905, Russian merchants organized large fishing companies and formed a joint-stock firm in Aralsk. This was the beginning of fishery in the Aral Sea and shipbuilding plants soon followed in Aralsk. After the Revolution, the station “Aralskoye more (sea)” with the adjoining settlement received the name Aralsk. In 1938, Aralsk and the Aralsky district became a part of newly formed Kzyl-Orda oblast of Kazakh SSR and turned into the town. Aralsk is not to be confused with Fort Aralsk which was about 120 km south. In 1847 Russia built Raimsk, later called Fort Aralsk, near the mouth of the Syr Darya. In either 1848 or 1853 or 1855 Raimsk was abandoned and Fort Aralsk moved upriver to Fort Number One, or Kazalinsk. Further upriver were forts No. 2 and 3 which were the old Kokandi forts of Karmaktschy and Kumish-Kurgan. Fort Aralsk was used to launch ships to map the Aral Sea and as a base to attack Ak Mechet.This section from ‘An Indian Officer’, Russia’s March towards India,1894, page 160 and Hugo Stumm,The Russian Campaign against Khiva in 1873,1876, pages 29 and 229. Since these sources contradict this section needs to be improved. =Decline= Since the retreat of the Aral Sea since 1960, due to diversion of the rivers flowing into it for irrigation, mainly of cotton, during the Soviet era, Aral is now completely landlocked about 12 km from the northern remnant of the Aral Sea,http://www.stephenmbland.com/#!kazakhstan-measuring-the-northern-aral/cewp though this is less than the 100 km distance observed before the completion of a dam in 2005. Aral has greatly diminished in population and socioeconomic significance, resulting in high levels of unemployment. For the last 25 years it has not been possible to see the sea from the town. There are also serious health problems for the local population caused by airborne toxic chemicals exposed to the wind by the retreating waters and, possibly, from chemical and biological agents unsafely stored on the island of Vozrozhdeniya. =Aral smallpox incident= In 1971, a massive public health response to a smallpox outbreak in Aral ensued once the disease was recognized as resulting from the release of weaponized smallpox from a nearby biological weapons test site. In less than 2 weeks, approximately 50,000 residents of Aral were vaccinated. Household quarantine of potentially exposed individuals was enacted, and hundreds were isolated in a makeshift facility at the edge of the city. All traffic in and out of the city was stopped, and approximately 54,000 square feet of living space and 18 metric tons of household goods were decontaminated by health officials. The original outbreak sickened ten people in Aral, of whom 3 died.Zelicoff, A.P., “An epidemiological analysis of the 1971 smallpox outbreak in Aralsk, Kazakhstan” (2002), In: Tucker, J.B. and R.A.

It was first formulated by Alfred G. Knudson in 1971 and led indirectly to the identification of cancer-related genes. Knudson won the 1998 Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award for this work. Knudson performed a statistical analysis on cases of retinoblastoma, a tumor of the retina that occurs both as an inherited disease and sporadically. He noted that inherited retinoblastoma occurs at a younger age than the sporadic disease. In addition, the children with inherited retinoblastoma often developed the tumor in both eyes, suggesting an underlying predisposition. Knudson suggested that two \\"hits\\" to DNA were necessary to cause the cancer. In the children with inherited retinoblastoma, the first mutation in what later came to be identified as the RB1 gene, was inherited, the second one acquired. In non-inherited retinoblastoma, instead two mutations, or \\"hits\\", had to take place before a tumor could develop, explaining the later onset. It was later found that carcinogenesis (the development of cancer) depended both on the mutation of proto-oncogenes (genes that stimulate cell proliferation) and on the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, which are genes that keep proliferation in check. Knudson's hypothesis refers specifically, however, to the heterozygosity of tumor suppressor genes. An inactivation of both alleles is required, as a single functional tumor suppressor gene is usually sufficient. Some tumor suppressor genes have been found to be \\"dose-dependent\\" so that inhibition of one copy of the gene (either via genetic or epigenetic modification) may encourage a malignant phenotype, which is termed haploinsufficiency. Related ideas Field cancerization may be an extended form of the Knudson hypothesis. This is the phenomenon of various primary tumors developing in one particular area of the body, suggesting that an earlier \\"hit\\" predisposed the whole area for cancer. Announced in 2011, chromothripsis similarly involves multiple mutations, but asserts that they may all appear at once. This idea, affecting only 2–3% of cases of cancer, although up to 25% of bone cancers, involves the catastrophic shattering of a chromosome into tens or hundreds of pieces and then being patched back together incorrectly. This shattering, it is presumed, takes place when the chromosomes are compacted during normal cell division, but the trigger for the shattering is unknown. Under this model, cancer arises as the result of a single, isolated event, rather than the slow accumulation of multiple mutations. The exact function of some tumor suppressor genes is not currently known (e.g. MEN1, WT1), but based on these genes following the Knudson \\"two- hit\\" hypothesis, they are strongly presumed to be suppressor genes.

Detail from a Japanese painting circa 1890s-1900s. , also known as Kachi-Kachi Mountain and The Farmer and the Badger, is a Japanese folktale in which a tanuki (Japanese raccoon dog) is the villain, rather than the more usual boisterous, well- endowed alcoholic. Story The tied-up tanuki enticing the woman to set him free, from The Japanese Fairy Book =The trouble-making tanuki= As the story goes, a man caught a troublesome tanuki in his fields, and tied it to a tree to kill and cook it later. When the man left for town, the tanuki cried and begged the man's wife who was making some mochi, a sweet rice dish, to set him free, promising he would help her. The wife freed the animal, only to have it turn on her and kill her. The tanuki then planned a foul trick. Using its shapeshifting abilities, the tanuki disguised itself as the wife and cooked a soup, using the dead woman's flesh. When the man came home, the tanuki served him the soup. After the meal, the tanuki reverted to its original appearance and revealed its treachery before running off and leaving the poor man in shock and grief. =Enter the rabbit= The bundle is set on fire The couple had been good friends with a rabbit that lived nearby. The rabbit approached the man and told him that it would avenge his wife's death. Pretending to befriend the tanuki, the rabbit instead tortured it through various means, from dropping a bee's nest on it to 'treating' the stings with a peppery poultice that burned. The title of the story comes from the especially painful trick that the rabbit played. While the tanuki was carrying a heavy load of kindling on his back to make a campfire for the night, he was so burdened that he did not immediately notice when the rabbit set fire to the kindling. Soon, the crackling sound reached its ears and it asked the rabbit what the sound was. \\"It is Kachi-Kachi Yama\\" the rabbit replied. \\"We are not far from it, so it is no surprise that you can hear it!\\". Eventually, the fire reached the tanuki's back, burning it badly, but without killing it. =Boat of mud= The tanuki challenged the rabbit to a life or death contest to prove who was the better creature. They were each to build a boat and race across a lake in them. The rabbit carved its boat out of a fallen tree trunk, but the foolish tanuki made a boat of mud. In other versions the rabbit built both boats. The two competitors were evenly matched at first, but the tanuki's mud boat began dissolving in the middle of the lake. As the tanuki was failing in its struggle to stay afloat, the rabbit proclaimed its friendship with the human couple, and that this was the tanuki's punishment for its horrible deeds. In other versions the rabbit strikes the tanuki with his oar to ensure he sinks. The rabbit then goes back to the old man's home and tell him about the vengeance, much to the relief of the old man. He thanks the rabbit for his deed. =Variations= There are other versions that alter some details of the story, such as the severity of what the tanuki did to the woman and how the tanuki got the mud boat. Modern-day references Mt. Kachi Kachi and its Tenjō-Yama Park Mt. Kachi Kachi Ropeway refer to this story and have statues depicting portions of the story. Shikoku Tanuki Train Line railway station in Japan uses the slogan \\"Our trains aren't made of mud\\", a direct reference to the \\"Kachi-Kachi Yama\\" tale. In the video game Super Mario Sunshine, in the level \\"Noki Bay\\", Mario meets a \\"Tanooki\\" who gives free rides on mud boats, a clear reference to the boat that the tanuki in this tale used. While these boats can stay afloat, they will dissolve if they stay still for too long or if they bump into something. In the anime Hoozuki no Reitetsu, the rabbit is one of the best torturers in Hell, who goes into a blind rage when someone says the word tanuki/racoon. In the comedic anime Heya Camp, the main characters visit Mt. Kachi Kachi and relate the tale while riding the ropeway. They incorrectly recall the details however, mixing in portions of the fable The Tortoise and the Hare as well as leaving out the grim tone of the original, including stating “they all lived happily ever after”.

The group is currently proscribed as a terrorist organization by Iran and Japan. Since 2018, it is a registered lobby in the United States. Komala has been engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Iranian government, notably during the 1979 Kurdish rebellion and the Iran–Iraq War. It was also involved in armed conflict against the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI) during the 1980s and early 1990s. After a long time ceasefire, in 2017 the organization declared to have resumed armed conflict with Iran.  History  It is not known when exactly the organization began its activity. According to the account of Abdullah Mohtadi, he co-founded the group on 27 October 1969 at a secret initiation meeting together with six other Kurdish students in Tehran. This is disputed by Hussein Moradbegi and Iraj Farzad, two co-founders who state that the group was officially born on 26 January 1979. Abbas Vali argues the latter view is correct, as the 1969-established organization had no specific ethnic identity and had no position on Kurdistan, and Kurdish members of the former –Foad Mostafa Soltani, Mohammad Hossein Karimi, Abdollah Mohtadi, Tayeb Abbas Ruh Illahi, Mohsen Rahimi, Ibrahim Alizade, Sa’ed Vatandoust, Hussein Moradbagi, Omar Ilkhanizadeh and Iraj Farzad– created an offshoot. The organization initially operated underground, and went into public after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Shortly afterwards, they boycotted March 1979 referendum, as well as the next referendum of December 1979. Ladislav Bittman wrote in The KGB and Soviet Disinformation that Komala was part of KGB's network in Iran, and was founded under financial and ideological influence of Soviet Union. Edgar O'Ballance states that Komala received \\"help\\" from the Soviet KGB. In 1981, Komala refused to join the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). In September 1983, the group underwent organizational changes and patterned itself as an orthodox communist party, eventually joining Communist Party of Iran, as its Kurdish wing. In 2000, the faction led by Abdullah Mohtadi split from the latter and styled itself as the \\"original\\" Komala. During George W. Bush administration, the group's leader met American officials in 2005 and 2006 amidst approval of Iran Freedom and Support Act budget. While it is unclear which groups have been funded through the program, Mohtadi welcomed an aid in 2008 and stated \\"If you’re a political movement that is part of an opposition, you need help from abroad... We're not ashamed to admit it.\\" In 2006, the party set up its Sweden-based satellite television named Rojhelat TV. Turkish NTV reported that the channel has been established with financial assistance from the United States., On grounds that politburo acts non-democratic, the faction led by Omar Ilkhanizade split in October 2007, founding the faction of reform. On 29 April 2008, another faction led by Abdulla Konaposhi accused Mohtadi of \\"non- democratic management\\", and expressing dissatifcation to a policy of a cooperation with monarchists including Reza Pahlavi, split from the group to establish the reunification faction.  Ideology  The group is ideologically Marxist–Leninist, therefore it saw itself revolutionary and transcending ethnic boundaries, unlike rival Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. It was predominantly Maoist during first decade of its activity and adopted it as a mobilization strategy to recruit from peasantry and lower urban class. Michael Gunter says that inspired by Chinese Communist Revolution, they became Maoists and viewed Kurdish nationalism as parochial. However at its first congress held in 1979, the ideology was renounced due to being \\"inappropriate to Kurdish conditions in Iran\\". In 1981, the group initiated self-criticism of its past and concluded that what it needs is \\"strong links with the proletariat\\". In 2000, when the party claimed reestablishment, it criticized some reports to the 8th congress of the CPI in 1995 for not being correct from the Marxist viewpoint and giving more privileges to the bourgeois nationalist groups. Sabah Mofidi described the party's position on political spectrum in 2016 as \\"radical left\\", adding that \\"in the line of the created changes in the practical thought of Marxism and indeed the indigenous Marxism accommodated with the place-time conditions of various societies, it has become more pragmatic and taken steps to realism\\". It is currently a member of the Progressive Alliance which was formed in 2013 as an international association of social democratic and socialist parties.  Armed activities  Komala Peshmerga in 2013 Following Iran–Iraq War, the group were stationed inside Iraqi soil and were supported by Saddam Hussein and his Ba'athist regime, who was willing to leverage insurgent groups against Tehran. Saddam gave the group money, logistical support and arms. After 1991, they found more secure sanctuaries under de facto autonomous Kurdistan Region. Headquarters of the group is currently located in an installation in Zergwez, about a 20-minute drive southeast of Sulaymaniya. A European mission reported in 2012 that the camp has strict security measures at the entry gate. Their previous camp was located in the vicinity of Halabja, near Iran–Iraq border, but after they suffered from attacks by Iranian Armed Forces, they moved to the current place. James Martin of The Jerusalem Post who visited the camp in 2007, wrote that Komala guerillas were equipped with AK-47s and RPGs, and are also trained in using anti-aircraft guns. A report published by Combating Terrorism Center in 2017, estimated that the group has less than 1,000 members.  Designation as a terrorist organization  Iran and Japan have listed Komala as a terrorist organization.  Lobbying activities  In September 2018, the group opened an office in Washington D.C., and formally registered as a lobby organization in the United States, while it was reported to hold meetings with Congressmen from both parties since at least 2015. According to filed reports, Komala spent $7,500 in 2018 and in the next year, penned a $4,000 per month contract with the firm AF International, along with another worth $40,000 with Cogent Law Group. One-fourth of latter included working on an op-ed, advise to establish a charitable foundation in the U.S., and \\"develop\\" Wikipedia page.

He is the loyal household butler of the Stark family. Since the 1990s, the character has appeared heavily in media adaptations of Iron Man and Avengers stories. In 2012, Edwin Jarvis was ranked 25th in IGN's list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\". In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Edwin Jarvis was portrayed by James D'Arcy in the ABC television series Agent Carter and the 2019 film Avengers: Endgame. Publication history Jarvis first appeared in Tales of Suspense #59 (November 1964), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Jarvis received an entry in the Official Mightiest Heroes! from an Avengers backup story featuring Jarvis.Michelinie, David; Stern, Roger; Pérez, George; and Day, Gene. \\"Bully\\", The Avengers #201 (November 1980). Fictional character biographyBackstory= Born of modest origins, Edwin Jarvis served in the Royal Air Force during World War II and was its champion boxer three years running. He later moved to the United States where he became manservant to Howard Stark and Maria Stark and watched over the Starks' mansion even after their deaths. =Avengers= His name and English origin bears resemblance to Jeeves, the fictional sagacious valet in the books by P. G. Wodehouse. When Iron Man (Tony Stark) called the Avengers' first meeting and donated the Stark house as the Avengers Mansion headquarters, Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years thereafter, acting as a father figure to some of the newcomers. Jarvis was there when the first guest, the time-lost Captain America (Steve Rogers), became a member of the Avengers. He was the only one to stay with the Avengers for their entire existence, a distinction not even Captain America can claim. As a result, Captain America has stated that Jarvis should be regarded just as much of an Avenger as he is. Jarvis spent some time as the primary babysitter for Franklin Richards, the super-powered son of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, when the two Fantastic Four members were residing at the mansion. He also served as the sponsor to Silverclaw while the latter was growing up, and the future Avengers member has come to regard him as an uncle.Avengers vol. 3 #8 (September, 1998) Being a manservant to the Avengers meant that Jarvis has had to deal with their enemies on several occasions. In Avengers #59 and #60 (December 1969, January 1970), he was assaulted by intruders in the mansion and bound and gagged. Jarvis has also been personally involved in many adventures, including leading the evacuation of a stalled subway train during a citywide disaster and battling a demonically possessed car. Jarvis defended the floating Hydrobase against a horde of robots built by Doctor Doom during the Acts of Vengeance crisis. He was present when one of the many incarnations of the Masters of Evil attacked the mansion. Taken hostage, he was brutally beaten by Mr. Hyde while Captain America and the Black Knight were forced to watch.Avengers 273-277 (1986-87) His physical injuries included a shattered knee and 90% loss of vision in his left eye, forcing him to wear an eyepatch for some time; however, Jarvis refused to retire, believing instead that confronting his fears gave him more in common with the Avengers. Jarvis personally confronted Loki, risking great danger, after realizing the villain had tricked his way inside the mansion. He tendered his resignation during Iron Man's battle with alcoholism,Iron Man #127 (October 1979) but returned not long afterwards.Iron Man #128 (November 1979) \\"Demon in a Bottle\\" In his duties as the Avengers' manservant, he was entrusted with items of great power, including the Casket of Ancient Winters. =The New Avengers= When the New Avengers were formed, Jarvis was called back after taking a holiday \\"for the first time in years\\", having been informed that his 'special' services were once again needed. Jarvis often confronts Wolverine over the man's poor kitchen etiquette, a battle only new member Spider-Man's Aunt May was able to win. Jarvis seemingly struck up a relationship with May that had moved into Stark Tower with Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson after her house burnt down. When Spider-Man switched sides during the Civil War, however, May and Mary Jane fled Stark Tower to live in hiding. In a New Avengers Civil War story, Jarvis was shot by an employee who was opposed to Tony Stark using technology invented to enforce the Superhuman Registration Act. However, it appears Jarvis recovers from this wound as he is shown to be working again in Civil War: The Initiative. He also humorously mentions that if Stark allowed \\"that Tigra %^#$\\" in the new incarnation of the Avengers, Tony would need to find someone else to do the laundry; Tigra had worked for Stark's side throughout the entirety of the Civil War incident. In the 2008 storyline One More Day, Jarvis is given over $2,000,000 by Stark to pay for May's hospital bills following an assassination attempt in the aftermath of Peter's own decision to publicly reveal Spider-Man's true identity. Jarvis visibly breaks down upon seeing May in the hospital bed, confessing his deep love to the Parkers.The Amazing Spider-Man #544 As a consequence of the \\"One More Day\\" storyline, however, Spider-Man's timeline has undergone a major continuity overhaul,J. Michael Straczynski and Joe Quesada. \\"One More Day\\", Part 4 of 4, The Amazing Spider-Man #545 (January 2008), Marvel Comics including Jarvis's relationship with the Parkers. =Secret Invasion= Later that year, the Secret Invasion storyline revealed that Edwin Jarvis has been replaced by a Skrull agent for some time.Secret Invasion #1 Using a computer virus, he disables a number of Stark Enterprises facilities, as well as Iron Man's armor. This agent also obtained access to Tony Stark's records on the Sentry (Robert Reynolds) in order to discover weaknesses, as the Skrulls were unable to duplicate Sentry's powers because Sentry's limits were unknown even to Iron Man.Mighty Avengers #14 He later approaches Maria Hill on the destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier in the middle of the ocean and tells Maria to surrender along with the S.H.I.E.L.D. crew. Maria uses a Life Model Decoy as a distraction while the real one escapes and detonates the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. During the fight between Veranke and Criti Noll's forces against the heroes and villains, the Skrull-Jarvis (who somehow survived the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier explosion) watches from Avengers Tower as the energy washes over hero, villain and Skrull alike. While holding Jessica Jones and Luke Cage's child, he comments that it doesn't matter if the Skrulls win or lose, so long as \\"God's\\" will is done.Secret Invasion #7 After the final battle, the real Jarvis is discovered alive, prompting Jessica to discover that her baby had been taken by the Skrull impostor.Secret Invasion #8 During the Dark Reign storyline, Jarvis is later shown in a support group meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.Avengers: The Initiative #20 The Skrull impersonator is eventually found in a hideout and was shot by Bullseye after returning Luke's and Jessica's baby.New Avengers #49 Having refused to serve under Norman Osborn's personal Avengers, Jarvis is sought out by Hercules and Amadeus Cho to be a part of the new Mighty Avengers team, Amadeus having determined that Jarvis is the one constant of the Avengers.Mighty Avengers #21 =Fear Itself= During the Fear Itself storyline, Jarvis manages to escape Avengers Tower when it's under attack by the Thing (in the form of Angrir: Breaker of Souls).

When Edwin thought it was a sign for him to retire, J.A.R.V.I.S. stated that its programming is not yet complete.Avengers #690. Marvel Comics. CharacterizationPersonal life= Edwin Jarvis once started a pen pal relationship with a young girl who would grow up to be the superhero Silverclaw; it was later revealed that the orphanage, aware of Silverclaw's abilities and Jarvis's ties to the Avengers, chose to assign Jarvis as Silverclaw's sponsor in the hope that his ties to the Avengers could be useful. Silverclaw's trip to the United States to meet Jarvis would be foiled when the youth was forced into helping terrorists in a massive attack. Silverclaw's efforts helped the people in danger at the airport, including Jarvis himself. Since then, Silverclaw has referred to him as 'Tio (Uncle) Edwin', with Avengers such as Janet van Dyne noting that Silverclaw's ties to Jarvis made the girl practically family. While Jarvis was shown dating May Parker during Spider-Man's initial career in the New Avengers, this relationship has been negated by the revelation that the man that May had dated was a Skrull impostor. Jarvis also has a mother to whom he is very close.Avengers Annual vol 3 =Powers and abilities= Edwin Jarvis is skilled at self-defence and basic hand-to-hand combat. He was a former boxing champion of the Royal Air Force for three years and had received military combat training and personal tutelage in unarmed combat by Captain America.

During the initial 12 issue run of A-Next, Jarvis is shown as a mentor to the young heroes. Along with Scott Lang, Jarvis attempts to aid and assist the Avengers anyway he can. He was later joined by Tony Stark and the blind Hawkeye. =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel version of Edwin Jarvis is different from his original version and is much more sarcastic and acerbic towards his employer Iron Man (Tony Stark).The Ultimates #2 Jarvis is only Tony's personal butler. While Tony dated and became engaged to Natasha Romanova, Jarvis was shown to be continuously at odds with Natasha and both were quick to hurl insults at one another. Jarvis was later shot in the head by Natasha, a traitor within the Ultimates team. His death is a contributing factor to Tony's descent into full-blown alcoholism.The Ultimates 2 #13 Another Ultimate equivalent is William \\"Jarvis\\", Tony's new personal servant tolerates being called Jarvis.Ultimate Comics: Ultimates #1 In other mediaTelevision= * Edwin Jarvis appeared in the \\"Captain America\\" segment of The Marvel Super Heroes, voiced by Vernon Chapman. * Edwin Jarvis appeared as a supporting character in The Avengers: United They Stand, voiced by Graham Harley. * Edwin Jarvis appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series Agent Carter, portrayed by James D'Arcy.

It was closely related to the Automatic Voice Network or AUTOVON, which was the main non-secure switched telephone network for the military.  Phase I  During the mid 1960s, the United States Government decided to implement a worldwide secure voice network. This was named Automatic Secure Voice Communications Network, or by its acronym AUTOSEVOCOM, and was the National Security Agency's first program for the United States Department of Defense's telephone protection. It was a cumbersome and expensive system that was available only for high-level users. Because of its inadequacies, the Defense Department capped it at 1850 terminals, and in the late 1960s, hoping for something better, decided not to continue with the expansion of AUTOSEVOCOM.Thomas R. Johnson, American Cryptology during the Cold War, 1945-1989, 1998, Chapter 17, p. 142. Phase I of the network was approved by the Deputy Secretary of Defense in July 1967 and after that it took several years to implement AUTOSEVOCOM within the continental United States. AUTOSEVOCOM-I was a non-tactical network that enabled users to discuss classified or sensitive information over the telephone. The network consisted of switching centres, transmission facilities and subscriber terminals. Subscribers were homed either on an AUTOSEVOCOM switch, on an Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON) switch, or a Joint Overseas Switchboard (JOSS), which were for example operated and maintained by numerous Signal Battalions in Vietnam. The AUTOSEVOCOM switches provided for wideband secure voice communications between local subscribers and enabled them to establish long-distance secure voice calls. The majority of the long-distance calls were routed by the AUTOVON.  Phase II  Difficulties with speech intelligibility, requirements for voice recognition,How to Wreck a Nice Beach: The Vocoder from World War II to Hip-Hop, By Dave Tompkins the holding of telephone conferences, speedier service, and simpler calling procedures led Defense officials to approve the development of an improved system, called AUTOSEVOCOM II. The Army was designated as the agency with the primary responsibility of developing the system. In May 1976, the Deputy Secretary of Defense approved the full-scale development of the AUTOSEVOCOM II programme. AUTOSEVOCOM II incorporated technological advances and furnished higher quality communications for the several thousand subscribers who were expected to use it when put into operation during the years 1980 to 1985. The U.S. Army Communications Command acted as program manager for AUTOSEVOCOM II. The Automatic Secure Voice Communications Network was succeeded by the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) and the STU-III secure phones. The last AUTOSEVOCOM secure voice switch in the world was deactivated at the Pentagon in 1994.Christopher H.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 18, 2003. Moe, unhappy and suicidal, inadvertently saves Maggie's life. The two of them grow to love each other. Plot The town goes to the Springfield Botanical Gardens to see the blooming of a Sumatran Century Flower. Because the huge crowd is exactly one person over the maximum legal capacity, Chief Wiggum decides to eject the already unpopular and bitter Moe from the ceremony. However, this otherwise unwelcoming gesture is a blessing in disguise, as when the flower opens, it emits a horrible smell, sickening the townspeople and causing them to flee. When the townspeople start to drive away from the Botanical Gardens, the Simpsons become trapped in a traffic jam. Lisa tries to warn Homer that the traffic is moving, but he accelerates too hard and hits the brakes suddenly. The force sends Maggie flying through the sunroof after her safety belt breaks. Moe, who is incidentally standing depressed on the edge of a bridge about to jump and commit suicide, accidentally catches Maggie just as she is about to fall into the river below the bridge. Moe is then instantly declared a hero, much to his surprise, and he instantly falls in love with the infant. The Simpsons let Moe babysit Maggie all the time and she is instantly attached to him. After a while, Marge is happy that she has had plenty of time to get things done, but Homer feels left out of Maggie's life and worries because she is his last chance to be a good father. Later, Moe tells Maggie the story of The Godfather. When he gets to the part where Don Corleone plays with his grandson, Moe demonstrates how the Don scares him by sticking a cut-up orange in his mouth, and Maggie enjoys it. When it comes to Maggie's birthday party, Moe annoys everyone with his behavior and his gift to Maggie: a toy-sized rendition of his bar, featuring \\"Classic Drunk Barney\\" and \\"Drunk Talking Homer\\". When Marge and Homer learn that Moe has installed his own baby-monitoring system in Maggie's room, they decide that they have had enough, and as a result, they ban Moe from their house for good. Moe reverts to being depressed, to the point of him imagining the barflies as Maggie. One night, the family is asleep, and Maggie wakes up and hears the mafia outside the house, plotting to kill the Castellaneta family. When one of the mobsters feels hesitant, Fat Tony does the Godfather- orange routine to cheer him up, and Maggie recognizes it and decides to follow the mobsters. When Homer and Marge find her missing, they assume that Moe kidnapped her, and they track him down with the aid of the police. They see Moe at his oven, and they think that Maggie is inside, but it turns out to really be a ham. When Moe is told that Maggie is missing, he offers to help the Simpsons find her. Searching the Simpsons' house yard, the group find the cut-up orange that Fat Tony used, and Moe works out that Maggie must have followed the mobsters. Maggie follows the mobsters to Luigi's, where Fat Tony's gang and the Castellanetas are having a meeting. Maggie enters the restaurant where the two gangs are about to start a gun battle. The situation deteriorates when both groups of mobsters are aiming weapons at each other and Maggie is in the middle of an \\"Italian-American Mexican standoff\\". Homer, Marge and Moe are standing outside and Moe decides to go inside and save Maggie. Moe goes inside, and to prevent being shot, tells the gangsters about Maggie's innocence and how it redeemed his life. They start to cry, and Moe and Maggie leave safely. The family apologizes for their injustice against Moe, and Homer and Moe decide to have a \\"playdate\\": Homer spends quality time with the ham, and Moe spends more time with Maggie. Production \\"Moe Baby Blues\\" was written by J. Stewart Burns and directed by Lauren MacMullan as part of the fourteenth season of The Simpsons (2002–2003). Reception Hank Azaria, who voices Moe and other The Simpsons characters, won an Emmy Award for his work on this episode. The episode has received positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club writer Emily VanDerWerff, who holds the opinion that by the start of the 2000s The Simpsons had declined in quality compared to its earlier years, praised \\"Moe Baby Blues\\" for being as good as the better episodes of the series.

It is owned by the National Trust and is designated a Scheduled monument for its Neolithic flint mine and Iron Age hillfort. Cissbury Ring is the largest hill fort in Sussex, the second largest in England and one of the largest in Europe overall, covering some 60 acres (24 hectares). The earthworks that form the fortifications were built around the beginning of the Middle Iron-Age possibly around 250 BC but abandoned in the period 50 BC - 50 AD. The site of the fort contains a Neolithic mine, one of the first flint mines in Britain. Around 200 shafts were dug into Cissbury hill over around 900 years of use. Shafts were up to deep with diameters at the surface. Up to eight galleries extended outwards from the bottoms of the shafts, often interconnecting with one another. The site has been damaged by illicit metal detecting. Structure The ditches and banks are the remains of a defensive wall that enclosed of land; the inner band of the wall is over a mile around. The ditches are said to be as deep as three metres and were filled with loosened chalk and covered with timber palisade. The 600 foot (184 m) hill is open to the public. From the top, one is able to see to the west Selsey, Chichester Cathedral, the Spinnaker Tower and the Isle of Wight. To the east, one is able to see Brighton, the Seven Sisters and Beachy Head. Cissbury Ring is the highest point in the borough of Worthing. History Several Bronze Age barrows have been found just outside Cissbury Ring. In the Romano-British period, farmers settled within the ramparts of the hill fort. In 1867-8 Augustus Lane-Fox excavated part of Cissbury Ring. During World War II, Cissbury Ring was used as a camp for the 2nd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in preparation for the Normandy landings. At this time much of the fort within the ramparts was ploughed to provide food. While on manoeuvres, tanks destroyed the dew pond at the north side of the fort. A gap was made in the ramparts to accommodate a gun which was used to fire at ships in the English Channel and an anti-aircraft gun was sited by the gap. Artefacts from Cissbury Ring can be found at Worthing Museum and Art Gallery, the Museum of Sussex Archaeology, Lewes and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Silver pennies from the reign of Ethelred II (978-1016) can be found at the British Museum. Etymology Once taken to mean Caesar's fort (after Julius Caesar) or Cissa's fort (after South Saxon king Ælle's son, Cissa), both theories of Cissbury's meaning have been discounted. In the early eleventh century in the reign of Ethelred the Unready, Cissbury was known as 'Sith(m)esteburh', which is taken to mean the 'last or the latest fort'. This may mean that Cissbury was the last fort to be refortified, after another nearby fort such as that at Burpham. It seems that the name Cissbury was altered to accommodate the legend that the fort was linked to Cissa the South Saxon. Flint mines Neolithic flint mine Long before the hill was fortified, flint mines were being excavated in the area. Some shafts went down as far as . The shafts at Cissbury were excavated with antler picks, much like those at Grimes Graves and elsewhere. Flint was the common material for making stone axes for felling timber and working wood during the neolithic period. The site was one of the first Neolithic flint mines in Britain and it was exploited throughout the period (the nearby Harrow Hill series of flint mines is slightly older). It is part of a group of flint mines in Sussex which followed a rich seam of flint- bearing chalk. Other examples include Grimes Graves in Norfolk, and Harrow Hill nearby. Cissbury was one of several important mining industries in the UK during the Neolithic and is thought to have been used into the Bronze Age, and later the Iron Age though flint mining probably stopped during the late neolithic, but there is some evidence of re-use of flint for tools during later times. Axes and Blades (struck from cores) account for most of the tools produced at Cissbury and examples of Cissbury flint can be found as far as Italy. Axes were produced on site, as rough-outs, these were then traded or used off site. Many other types of stone were in demand for stone axes such as the greenstone of the Langdale axe industry in the Lake District. The axes were essential for forest clearance for farming in the Neolithic period, and found many other uses, such as wood working. Around 200 shafts were dug into the Cissbury hill over around 900 years of use. Shafts were up to deep with diameters at the surface. Up to eight galleries extended outwards from the bottoms of the shafts, often interconnecting with one another. Excavation of the mine shafts by John Pull in the 1950s uncovered the remains of a young woman who had been apparently killed in a tunnel collapse around 2000 BC. Charcoal possibly from her torch and a miniature whale carved from chalk were with her. The possibility that the shaft was used for a ritual burial has also been suggested however. The remains of two other people, a man and a woman, were recovered from different shafts at Cissbury in the nineteenth century and it has been suggested that the exhausted mines had a secondary purpose for formal burial. Alternatively, it may have been expedient to send women into the mines as they could squeeze into the narrow galleries and some archaeologists have suggested that flint extraction was a rite of passage for the more slightly-built juvenile members of Neolithic societies. The site is significant as it represents the switch from open cast flint extraction favoured previously by prehistoric peoples who exploited deposits of flint close to the surface, to deep shaft mining which required more effort but produced more flint of a higher quality. Biology The site has unimproved chalk grassland, scrub and neutral grassland. Upright brome is dominant in the chalk grassland, while common grasses in the neutral grassland include Yorkshire fog, sheep's fescue and creeping bent. The scrub areas provide important habitats for birds and butterflies.

He currently works in the Reds' front office. Career For most of his career, the Dominican right-hander was essentially a two-pitch pitcher. He possessed a hard fastball (clocked in the low-to-mid 90s) and complemented it with a baffling circle changeup, both thrown from the three-quarters position. Soto's changeup was particularly effective against left-handed hitters. On occasion, Soto would also throw a slider, which he turned to more in the latter stage of his career. He less frequently threw a curveball. From to , Soto struck out 1,063 batters. On May 12, , Soto came very close to throwing a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. However, with two out in the top of the ninth inning and the Reds up 1–0, outfielder George Hendrick spoiled the no-hitter with a game-tying solo home run. The Reds won the game for Soto in the bottom of the ninth, 2–1. In , Soto finished second in voting for the National League's Cy Young Award. Philadelphia's John Denny was the winner. Statistically, 1983 and 1984 were Soto's best seasons. He compiled a 35–20 record with a 2.92 earned run average and he established himself as the ace of the Cincinnati Reds' rotation. However, the Reds finished with losing records in both seasons. In a 12-season career, all for Cincinnati, he was 100–92 with a 3.47 ERA in 297 games, 224 of them starts. He had 72 career complete games and 13 shutouts. He allowed 1,395 hits, 667 earned runs, 657 bases on balls and struck out 1,449 batters in 1,730 innings pitched. He also earned four saves (all during the 1980 season). By 1986, Soto's performance had rapidly deteriorated due to shoulder injury. On April 29, 1986, against the Montreal Expos, Soto became the 11th pitcher in major league history to surrender four home runs in an inning. Controversy On May 27, 1984, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, third baseman Ron Cey hit what was originally ruled a home run down the left field line. Believing the ball had gone foul, Soto and Reds manager Vern Rapp disputed the call, and during the argument, Soto shoved third-base umpire Steve Rippley, who had made the call. After conferring, the umpires changed their decision and ruled it a foul ball, drawing a protest from the Cubs. However, for shoving Rippley, Soto was ejected, prompting him to charge the field. Cubs coach Don Zimmer stepped in front of Rippley to prevent Soto from attacking the umpire, only to himself be tackled by Soto and (inadvertently) catcher Brad Gulden, which triggered a 10-minute brawl. Four days later, National League president Chub Feeney suspended Mario Soto for five games. In the second incident, on June 16, the Reds were playing the Atlanta Braves in Atlanta. Braves player Claudell Washington homered in the first inning off Soto. During Washington's second at-bat, Soto hit Washington in the shoulder with a pitch, but Washington only stared at Soto before going to first. On Soto's first pitch of Washington's third at bat, Washington swung and let go of his bat in the direction of first base and walked toward Soto. Umpire Lanny Harris attempted to intervene, but Washington threw Harris to the ground. Soto punched Washington, and both benches cleared. Reds catcher Dann Bilardello wrestled Washington to the ground and Soto threw the ball at Washington, but he struck Braves coach Joe Pignatano's shin instead. Soto was suspended five games and $5,000, and Washington received a three-game suspension and a $1,000 fine. 2001–2016 In 2001, Soto was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum. He has also worked with the team as a pitching coach, helping several Reds pitchers develop a change-up. He currently works in the Reds' front office. Soto is credited as the person who taught Edinson Vólquez and Johnny Cueto their change-ups, which have been go- to strikeout pitches in their careers.

In some parts of the U.S., this term can define certain acts of aggravated murder: a capital murder is any murder that makes the perpetrator eligible for the death penalty. Great Britain/UK In Great Britain, this offence was created by section 5 of the Homicide Act 1957. Previously all murders carried the death penalty on conviction, but the 1957 Act limited the death penalty to the following cases: * Murder in the course or furtherance of theft; s.5(1)(a) * Murder by shooting or by causing an explosion; s.5(1)(b) * Murder in the course or for the purpose of resisting, avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest, or of effecting or assisting an escape or rescue from legal custody; s.5(1)(c) * Murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his duty, or of a person assisting a police officer so acting; s.5(1)(d) * Murder of a prison officer acting in the execution of his duty, or of a person assisting a prison officer so acting, by a person who was a prisoner at the time when he did or was a party to the murder; s.5(1)(e). In all other cases murder carried the mandatory penalty of imprisonment for life. Section 1 of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 abolished the separate category of capital murder, and all murders now carry the mandatory penalty of imprisonment for life. Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, this offence was created by section 10 of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. On the trial of an indictment for capital murder, the jury could not return an alternative verdict to the offence charged in that indictment under section 6(2) of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967. Sections 1(4) and (5) of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 read: Republic of Ireland See sections 1(1)(b) and 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 1964 (both of which are now repealed) and section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990. United StatesLegal meaning= The term \\"capital murder\\" is used in only eight U.S. states; however, 29 states and United States federal government currently allow capital punishment, and each has its own terminology for an offense punishable by death. In most states, the term \\"First-Degree Murder\\" is used; others may use the term \\"Aggravated Murder\\" (such as New York, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, and Vermont), and some use simply \\"Murder\\". The eight states that use the term \\"Capital Murder\\" are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Kansas, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Texas, and Virginia. The state of Georgia uses the term \\"Malice Murder\\". Not all offenses are parallel between the states. In some, first-degree murder is a very broad term defined by a number of circumstances, only a few of which make a defendant eligible for execution. In other jurisdictions, an offense carrying the death penalty is strictly defined and is separate from other, similar crimes. Although legal definitions vary, capital murder in the United States usually means murder involving one or more of the following factors: * The victim is a police officer, firefighter, paramedic or similar public safety professional and was killed while on duty * The victim is killed during the commission of another violent felony, such as armed robbery, kidnapping, arson, etc. (felony murder) * The victim is tortured, raped or sexually assaulted, particularly if the victim is a child * Multiple murders are committed pursuant to one another * Murder-for-hire * Terrorism * The victim is murdered based on race, national origin, and other associated groups Some states may include other factors which amount to capital murder or its legal equivalent. =Punishment= Capital offenses in the United States are not punishable by death exclusively. Most states afford courts the option of imposing either the death penalty or a life sentence upon conviction, though lesser sentences are rare and in some cases legally impossible. Depending on the state, the presiding judge may determine the sentence, or the decision may be left to the jury. The United States Supreme Court has placed limitations on the use of the death penalty and has prohibited its use in cases where the offender is mentally incompetent, or was under the age of 18 at the time of the offense.

The company was founded by Arthur Pitney, who invented the first commercially available postage meter, and Walter Bowes as the Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company on April 23, 1920. Pitney Bowes provides customer engagement, customer information management, global e-commerce, location intelligence, and mailing and shipping services to approximately 1 million customers in about 100 countries around the world in 2016. The company is a certified \\"work-share partner\\" of the United States Postal Service, and helps the agency sort and process 15 billion pieces of mail annually. Pitney Bowes has also commissioned surveys related to international e-commerce. Pitney Bowes is based in Stamford, Connecticut, and operates a 300,000-square-foot Global Technology Center for manufacturing and engineering in Danbury, Connecticut. The company has 33 operating centers throughout the United States, and additional offices in Hatfield (United Kingdom), New Delhi, and Tokyo. As of December 2016, Pitney Bowes employed approximately 14,000 people worldwide. History In 1902, Arthur Pitney patented his first \\"double- locking\\" hand-cranked postage-stamping machine, and with patent attorney Eugene A. Rummler, founded the Pitney Postal Machine Company. In 1908, English emigrant and founder of the Universal Stamping Machine Company Walter Bowes began providing stamp-canceling machines to the United States Post Office Department. Bowes moved his operations to Stamford in 1917. These two companies merged to form the Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company in 1920 with the invention of the first commercially available postage meter. The company created its first logo, which \\"[symbolized] the security of the metered mail system\\", in 1930. In 1950, Pitney Bowes initiated an advertising campaign in national publications with the message, \\"Metered mail makes the mailer's life easier\\". In 1971, the company introduced a new logo, which represented the \\"intersection of paper-based and electronic communication\\". Pitney Bowes was valued at around $18 billion in December 1998. In April 2003, Pitney Bowes filed a lawsuit in Seattle's King County Superior Court against Mark Browne and Howard Gray, who founded the competing company Nexxpost in 2002, as well as six other former employees, for \\"[engaging] in transgressions ranging from misappropriation of trade secrets to violating confidentiality agreements\\". The two companies reached a settlement in August 2003. The company reported a profit of $498.1 million in 2003. In 2005, Pitney Bowes' revenue and earnings increased by more than 11 percent, and the company employed 32,500 people. In 2006, the company had $5.7 billion in annual revenue, and more than 35,000 employees. In 2008, in conjunction with other companies, Pitney Bowes donated two of its 3,400 patents to the Eco-Patent Commons, which is operated by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, in an effort to reduce pollution. One of the patents increases the lifespan of electronic scales, reducing landfill waste, and the other is an inkjet printing technology that reduces ink use. In 2009, Pitney Bowes was named one of the world's largest software companies by Software Magazine.

In 2014, the company announced plans for a rebrand. Pitney Bowes unveiled its new logo in January 2015, replacing one used since 1971; the rebranding campaign, which included an updated website and marketing, reportedly cost between $40 million and $80 million. In February 2012, the credit rating for Pitney Bowes International Holdings was lowered by Fitch Ratings from BBB+ to BBB. The ratings agency said its main concern was \\"the downward trajectory\\" of Pitney Bowes' revenue, and added that they have a \\"negative outlook.\\" In March 2014, Moody's assigned a long-term rating of Baa2 to the company's proposed $350 million senior unsecured notes (due 2024) and reiterated their stable outlook on PBI. Moody's cited \\"an improvement in the company's operating margin to around 19%, from about 15% historically, following the sale of its labor intensive management services business\\" and \\"an operational restructuring which could yield annual cost savings of up to $170 million by 2016.\\" In 2016, the company launched its first television advertising campaign in nearly twenty years; \\"Craftsmen of Commerce\\" cost $20 million and included three advertisements for national news and sports networks.

In 1934 it merged with the English Positivist Committee. The Society's members occupied themselves in applying the ideas of the philosophical school of Comtean positivism to current affairs of the day, including the movement for home rule in Ireland (which the Society supported, following Gladstone's lead), the Second Boer War (which the Society opposed), and the Indian independence movement (which the Society supported). History The Society was founded by Richard Congreve (1818-1899) in 1867. Its members at one time or another included Henry Tompkins (1870-1954); Donald Fincham (1916-1969); George Henry Lewes (1817-1878); Frederick William Walsh (1879-1923), who had been paralysed in an industrial accident but whose mind remained sharp; Paul Juste Decours; and Benjamin Fossett Lock (honorary secretary of the Society 1880-1886), who resigned in 1886 over the Irish home rule debate. In 1934 the London Positivist Society merged with the English Positivist Committee, taking the latter's name. The Society's presidents included *Edward Spencer Beesly (till 1901) *Shapland Hugh Swinny (1857-1923), Society president 1901-1923 Swinny was a personal friend of several Indian nationalists, including Bal Gangadhar Tilak.

There are many variants across the Caribbean, depending on the availability of local vegetables. The main ingredient is an indigenous leaf vegetable, traditionally either amaranth (known by many local names including callaloo, but not Spinach or bhaaji due to taste and texture), taro (known by many local names, including dasheeen bush, callaloo bush, callaloo, or bush) or Xanthosoma (known by many names, including coco & tannia). Since the leaf vegetable used in some regions may be locally called \\"callaloo\\" or \\"callaloo bush\\" \\"dasheen Leaves\\", some confusion can arise among the vegetables and with the dish itself. This, as many other Caribbean dishes are remnants of West African cuisine.  Cooking variations  Outside of the Caribbean, water spinach is occasionally used. Trinidadians, Grenadians and Dominicans primarily use taro/dasheen bush for callaloo, although Dominicans also use water spinach. Jamaicans, Belizeans, St. Lucians and Guyanese on the other hand use the name callaloo to refer to amaranth, and use it in a plethora of dishes and also a drink ('callaloo juice').Higman, B. W. “Jamaican Versions of Callaloo.” Callaloo, vol. 30, no. 1, 2007, pp. 351–368. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/30135936. The 'callaloo' made in Jamaica is different from the 'callaloo' made in Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada and rest of the Caribbean in terms of main ingredient (the leaf used) and other ingredients included. While Jamaicans tend to steam callaloo leaf with tomatoes, salt, peppers, onions, scallions, with or without salt-fish, Trinidadians and Saint Lucians use Callaloo leaves/ dasheen bush, okra, coconut milk, pumpkin, onions, bell peppers, local seasonings and spices along with crabs or pigtails. \\"Callaloo\\" in Trinidad is used in a variety of dishes including Callaloo soup or \\"oil down\\". Callaloo is the National Dish of the twin Island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and the Commonwealth of Dominica. Plant sources for callaloo leaves Xanthosoma *Taro, also called dasheen in the West Indies, the leaves of this root crop are used in the Trinidadian version of the dish. *Tannia or malanga (Xanthosoma) called calalu in Puerto Rico *Amaranth species include Amaranthus spinosus used in the West Indies; Amaranthus flavus is a yellow variety used in Brazil and known as caruru; Amaranthus viridis in Jamaica ; Amaranthus tricolor in the Caribbean *Pokeweed species, Phytolacca octandra or \\"West Indian foxglove\\" (no relation to garden foxglove, genus Digitalis) *Nightshade species, Solanum americanum *Water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica; a form of morning glory) In India(state ofAndhra and Telangana) people uses leafy vegetable (Thothakura) Callaloo recipes A Jamaican breakfast including callaloo (bottom right) Callaloo in Trinidad & Tobago and other eastern Caribbean countries is generally made with okra and dasheen or water spinach Ipomoea aquatica. There are many variations of callaloo which may include coconut milk, crab, conch, Caribbean lobster, meats, pumpkin, chili peppers, and other seasonings such as chopped onions and garlic. The ingredients are added and simmered down to a somewhat stew-like consistency. When done, callaloo is dark green in colour and is served as a side dish which may be used as a gravy for other food. Callaloo is widely known throughout the Caribbean and has a distinctively Caribbean origin, utilising indigenous (Xanthosoma) plants and modified with African influences, such as okra. (See Palaver sauce for the West African dish.). Trinidadians have embraced this dish from their ancestors and over time have added ingredients such as coconut milk to modify its flavour. Callaloo is mostly served as a side dish, for Trinidadians, Bajans, and Grenadians it usually accompanies rice, macaroni pie, and a meat of choice. In Guyana it is made in various ways without okra. In Jamaica, callaloo is often combined with saltfish and is usually seasoned with tomatoes, onion, escallion, scotch bonnet peppers and margarine/cooking oil and steamed. It is often eaten with roasted breadfruit, boiled green bananas and dumplings and it is a popular breakfast dish. In Grenada, callaloo is steamed with garlic, onion and coconut milk and often eaten as a side dish. Grenadians also stir or blend the mixture until it has a smooth consistent texture. Callaloo soup comprising callaloo, okra (optional), dumplings, ground provision like yam, potato (sweet and \\"Irish\\") chicken and beef is traditionally eaten on Saturdays. It is also one of the most important ingredient in Oil Down, the Island's National Dish comprising steamed breadfruit, callaloo, dumplings, ground provision, carrot and several varieties of meat--salt fish, chicken, pork. All of this is steamed in coconut milk and saffron powder. Salt and pepper is added. Due to the high iron content of callaloo, Grenadians douse it down with a fruit drink high in Vitamin C especially as Iron could only be absorbed in the presence of Vitamin C. In the Virgin Islands, callaloo is served with a dish of fungee on the side. In Guadeloupe, \\"calalou au crabe\\" (crab callaloo) is a traditional Easter dish. A similar variation is the recipe called \\"Laing\\" which is popular in the Philippines, mainly the Bicol region.

Among his many contributions to the field was the formulation of the Knudson hypothesis in 1971, which explains the effects of mutation on carcinogenesis (the development of cancer). Early life and education Knudson was born in Los Angeles, California in 1922. He received his B.S. from California Institute of Technology in 1944, his M.D. from Columbia University in 1947 and his Ph.D. from California Institute of Technology in 1956. He held a Guggenheim fellowship from 1953 to 1954. Career and research After an initial faculty appointment at the City of Hope Medical Center in California, Knudson became the Associate Dean for Basic Sciences at the State University of New York at the Stony Brook School of Medicine. From 1970 to 1976, Knudson served as the Dean of Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston in the Texas Medical Center. He was affiliated with Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia from 1976 until his death in 2016. Knudson is best known for his \\"two-hit hypothesis,\\" explaining the incidence of hereditary cancers, such as retinoblastoma. Humans inherit two copies of every gene, one from each parent (except for genes on the X and Y chromosomes in males). Some people inherit one mutated version and one normal version of the retinoblastoma gene, which produces the retinoblastoma protein involved in controlling cell cycle progression. The inherited mutation is \\"the first hit.\\" Over time, a mutation may arise in the normal version in one cell, thus producing \\"the second hit,\\" which leaves the cell unable to control the process of cell division in an orderly manner, leading to cancer. Knudson's insight was to compare the incidence of retinoblastomas, including the number of tumors, the ages of occurrence, and whether tumors occurred in both eyes, among children in families with and without hereditary predisposition to retinoblastomas. Children in families with a hereditary predisposition have more tumors at a younger age and usually have tumors in both eyes. Children in families without the hereditary predisposition usually have only one tumor at a later age. The differences in occurrence can be explained by the rate of gene mutation during cell division (a somatic mutation), and a model that requires only one somatic mutation per tumor in hereditary cases but requires two somatic mutations, one on each copy of a particular cell cycle control gene, in one cell lineage in non-hereditary cases, i.e. the co-occurrence of two rare events. Knudson subsequently showed that the model was not only applicable to retinoblastoma but also to Wilms' tumors of the kidney. These studies led to the concept of tumor suppressor genes, which Knudson called \\"anti-oncogenes.\\" Honors and awards He received numerous prizes and honorary doctorates for his work, most prominently the 1998 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. He also received the 1999 American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) Distinguished Career Award, the 2005 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Award for Lifetime Achievement in Cancer Research, and the 2004 Kyoto Prize in Life sciences.

His childhood name was Goro. Before Harukata he had the name of Takafusa (). He is also erroneously known as Harutaka. Harukata was born to the Sue clan, which was related to the Ōuchi clan, and served as shugodai of Suō Province. As a boy, he served Ōuchi Yoshitaka, a childhood friend. After genpuku, he was given the name Takafusa after Ōuchi Yoshitaka. In 1539, after his father Okifusa died of illness, he became the head of the Sue clan. Being an able retainer, he became known as the Samurai General Without Peer in the Western Provinces (Saigoku- musō no Samuraidaishō). From 1540 to 1542, he worked as the general, replacing Ōuchi Yoshitaka, in the war with the Amago clan. However, when Ōuchi's troops lost heavily in 1542, Yoshitaka's interest in war faded, and he began to incline to cultural activities. Because of this, the civil official Sagara Taketō became close to Yoshitaka, and Harukata's relationship with Yoshitaka declined. In 1551, Harukata succeeded in the coup against Ōuchi Yoshitaka, killing Sagara Taketō and leading Yoshitaka to commit suicide. The next year Harukata secured the control of the Ōuchi clan by making the adopted son of Yoshitaka, Ōuchi Yoshinaga (who was Ōtomo Haruhide, the half-brother of Ōtomo Sōrin), the head of the clan. At this time he changed his name from Takafusa to Harukata, as his master changed from Yoshitaka to Haruhide. Subsequently, he conducted a large military expansion, but this led to discontent among the retainers of the Ōuchi clan. In 1554 Yoshimi Masayori of Iwami Province, Yoshitaka's brother-in-law, and Mōri Motonari of Aki Province rebelled against Harukata. Sue Harukata's grave in the grounds of Tōun-ji, Hatsukaichi, Japan In the Battle of Oshikibata, Sue Harukata's retainer Takagawa, was defeated by Mori Motonari. In 1555 Harukata lost the Battle of Itsukushima to Mōri Motonari, and committed suicide after the battle. After the loss, the Ōuchi clan declined considerably and, two years later, Mōri Motonari annihilated the clan.

Origins The Vasaborg Coat of Arms. King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden had an illegitimate son called Gustav Gustavsson who in 1637 was ennobled under the name of Vasaborg, echoing his father's House of Vasa. Queen Christina of Sweden raised her illegitimate half-brother to the dignity of a count when she gave him the Countship of Nystad in 1647. He and his family were registered to the Swedish House of Knights as its sixth comital family. Count Gustav's wife was Countess Anna Sofia of Wied-Runkel. The Vasaborg coat of arms depicted a sheaf of hay, representing the arms of Vasa, crossed by a diagonal bend sinister, indicating Gustav's illegitimate origins. The family of Vasaborg lived mostly in the new Swedish possessions of Lower Saxony, where they received several estates. Their seat was at Wildeshausen, which was received by the first Count after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The second count of Nystad The second count of Nystad, Gustav Adolf (1653-1732), was a lieutenant colonel. His wife was countess Angelica Catharina of Leiningen- Westerburg. In 1679, following the Treaty of Nijmegen, Sweden pawned Wildeshausen's overlordship to the Prince-Bishop of Münster in exchange for a loan of 100,000 Riksdaler. Sweden lost the county in 1721, and the second count subjected himself to King George I of Great Britain. Stralenheim- Vasaborg The male line of the house of Vasaborg became extinct in 1754 with the death of the third count, George Maurice of Vasaborg (1678-1754). He was also the last male descendant of the House of Vasa. His remaining sister and the last official bearer of their surname, countess Henrietta Polyxena (1696-1777) died in 1777. However, two Vasaborg descendants survived: the children of George Maurice's late sister, the countess Sophia Elisabeth Christina of Vasaborg (1694-1736?) and her husband, Count Henning von Stralenheim (1663-1731), the sometime governor-general of Zweibrücken. These descendants were daughter Catharina Sophia (1717-64), who married the baron Eric Sparre (1700-42), Lord of Forbach in Lorraine; and son Count Henning Gustav (1719-1787). With the fading of the Vasaborg line, Henning Gustav von Stralenheim was adopted into it and began to use both names, typically written in Germany as \\"Count von Stralenheim-Wasaburg.\\" He married baroness Caroline von Esebeck (born in 1746) and had children who continued the Vasaborg name, the male line of which died out in 1872 and the female line of which still exists. In 1777, King Gustav III of Sweden forbade his distant cousin Henning Gustav from using the Swedish title and name Vasaborg, due to the king's pride for his own female-line ancestry from the royal Vasa dynasty. Because Vasaborg was outside of Swedish dominions, and the house's comital rank and titles were granted by the Holy Roman Empire, this Swedish royal declaration had very little effect in reality. Foreign counts and nobility listings continued using the name Stralenheim-Wasaburg. Of Count Henning Gustav's children, his daughter Christiana Louise (1783-1857) married the Swedish count Charles Adam Lewenhaupt (1760-1821) and left descendants in Sweden. Henning Gustav's oldest son, Count Heinrich Gustav (1766–1818), lived in Bavaria; his middle son, Count Carl August (1780-1842), in France, where his descendants reside.

The aim of the imprint was to feature super-powered characters who did not follow the traditional format of classic superhero adventures. Hard Time's first run was 12 issues long, published from April 2004 to March 2005. The series returned from hiatus in December 2005, titled Hard Time: Season Two. With the demise of DC Focus, this run was published under the unfocused DC bullet. DC announced Hard Time's cancellation in March 2006. The comic ended with issue #7 of Season Two. StorylineBackstory= Hard Time focuses on 15-year-old Ethan Harrow (early publicity referred to him as \\"Ethan Chiles\\"), who was involved in a high-school shooting scare gone wrong which cost several students their lives. For two years Travis Danes and the high school football team bullied Ethan and his friend Brandon Snood, whose home life was fairly bad. After Travis and two of his friends tried to rape a girl named Inez Mellencamp, Brandon stopped it by setting off the fire alarm. Travis and his friends merely got suspended for a week. Later Ethan and Brandon plan a \\"fake\\" school shooting as a way of getting back at the jocks. Unfortunately, things go wrong and Brandon winds up shooting several students and faculty members. As Ethan later tells his lawyer, \\"it was supposed to be a joke. Brandon told me the guns were loaded with blanks\\". Ethan is initially in shock; but when Brandon levels his gun at Alyssa Nichols, a girl that Ethan has feelings for, Ethan tries to stop him. Unsuccessful at first, Ethan's super-power emerges, killing Brandon. After the shooting, Travis was paralyzed and Brandon was dead, along with four others. Although Ethan was not directly involved with the murders, he was tried as an adult and given fifty years to life in prison with eligibility for parole in the year 2053. Ethan maintains that the media convicted him before he ever got to trial. =Season one= While in prison, Ethan continues to manifest a superpower called the \\"KHE-CHARE\\" that appears as psychic manifestation of his alter ego while he sleeps, or is otherwise unconscious. A fellow inmate, the elderly \\"Fruitcake\\" eventually instructs Ethan on the use of his power and its origin. Initially, Ethan is unaware of his alter ego, which acted on his suppressed emotions of anger and revenge. Ethan eventually learns how to control his powers and use them even in a conscious state. While in prison, Ethan encounters a number of people, including: :Prison Staff *Harvey Brickman, the warden *Dr. Robert Dinkens, a psychiatrist :Inmates *Hubert \\"Curly\\" Wallace, Ethan's cellmate and grandfather to Norma \\"Red\\" Rothenberg *George W. Cole, who gives Ethan the nickname \\"Prodigy\\". Released in 2009 and dead in 2010 in attempting a robbery. *Alonzo \\"Fruitcake\\" Mullins, who knows of Ethan's powers. Dead on December 16, 2012, stroke in bed. *Arturo Lopez, a Latino gang member whose girlfriend Mercedes is pregnant; later on in life (40 so years later) he is a \\"Don Arturo\\" and released. *Cindy Crane, a transgender woman. Released in 2011, obtained sexual reassignment surgery, and inherited her mother's salon. *Swift, Cindy's lover and a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, deceased *Gantry the Preacher, an arsonist, deceased *Lewis Gatherwood, a rapist, deceased *Raeder, the gang boss of the Aryan Brotherhood *Alcazar, the gang boss of the Diablos, a Latino gang *Kilo, Samoan, big man willing to throw his weight, for a candy bar or two *Everly, a craftsman who makes things out of glass, plastic, or wood for porn *Brazo, a one-armed artist who always needs supplies *Saeed, a prison smuggler who likes cigarettes, pruno * Duane Cutter, serial killer who carved up his victims While Ethan is in prison, life goes on outside. Ethan's mother, Sheila Harrow is dating Jack Forbes, his lawyer. Norma \\"Red\\" Rothenberg, the granddaughter of Curly corresponds with Ethan. Also, Alyssa Nichols, now institutionalized and currently residing at the Shady Grove mental institution, sends him letters thanking him for saving her life. She asked Ethan to write back, and the two share a dream-like relationship. On Ethan Harrow's 16th birthday, Red, the granddaughter of one of Ethan's fellow inmates, takes his virginity against the door of the visitor's restroom. Mercedes goes into labour as she and Arturo are being married. Ethan's lawyer asks his mother to marry him, but she said no. =Season two= The first issue of Season Two was released on December 7, 2005. Ethan met with his lawyer, who is trying to get him a new trial, and Red's parents, Julius and Truth Rothenberg, representatives of \\"The Prisoners' Rights Foundation\\". Ethan told them the full story of the school shooting. Jack told Ethan that the judge was up for an election and couldn't look \\"soft\\" on high school shooters. Jack told Ethan to stay out of trouble until the new trial. A new inmate named CUTTER ,who is a psycho, arrives at the prison. Cole starts schooling Ethan in \\"Prison Economics\\". Ethan's Khe-Chara starts having violent revulsion to CUTTER, so \\"Fruitcake\\" gives him a \\"Third Eye\\". The CUTTER befriends Hardin and Cindy into his \\"Sphere of Influence\\". Hard Time Season Two #7 jumps ahead 49 years to the year 2053, to the end of Ethan's sentence. His mind is scanned, to determine whether he is genuinely repentant for his crime; in the process, the various fates of everyone he met while in prison are revealed, as are many details about how his superhuman power functioned (which allowed him to send out his astral form to experience numerous activities outside the prison), and what happened to the people outside of prison. Eventually he is ruled to have truly atoned, and is released. He walks out the prison gate and sees a floating limousine is waiting for him; although the readers do not see who is inside the limousine, Ethan does, and gets in.

PRBS generators are used in telecommunication, such as in analog-to-information conversion , but also in encryption, simulation, correlation technique and time-of-flight spectroscopy.  Details  A binary sequence (BS) is a sequence a_0,\\\\ldots, a_{N-1} of N bits, i.e. :a_j\\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} for j=0,1,...,N-1. A BS consists of m=\\\\sum a_j ones and N-m zeros. A BS is a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) if its autocorrelation function, given by :C(v)=\\\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} a_ja_{j+v} has only two values: :C(v)= \\\\begin{cases} m, \\\\mbox{ if } v\\\\equiv 0\\\\;\\\\; (\\\\mbox{mod}N)  mc, \\\\mbox{ otherwise } \\\\end{cases} where :c=\\\\frac{m-1}{N-1} is called the duty cycle of the PRBS, similar to the duty cycle of a continuous time signal. For a maximum length sequence, where N = 2^k - 1, the duty cycle is 1/2. A PRBS is 'pseudorandom', because, although it is in fact deterministic, it seems to be random in a sense that the value of an a_j element is independent of the values of any of the other elements, similar to real random sequences. A PRBS can be stretched to infinity by repeating it after N elements, but it will then be cyclical and thus non- random. In contrast, truly random sequence sources, such as sequences generated by radioactive decay or by white noise, are infinite (no pre- determined end or cycle-period). However, as a result of this predictability, PRBS signals can be used as reproducible patterns (for example, signals used in testing telecommunications signal paths).  Practical implementation  Pseudorandom binary sequences can be generated using linear-feedback shift registers.Paul H. Bardell, William H. McAnney, and Jacob Savir, \\"Built-In Test for VLSI: Pseudorandom Techniques\\", John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1987. Some common sequence generating monic polynomials are :PRBS7 = x^{7} + x^{6} + 1 :PRBS9 = x^{9} + x^{5} + 1 :PRBS11 = x^{11} + x^{9} + 1 :PRBS15 = x^{15} + x^{14} + 1 :PRBS20 = x^{20} + x^{3} + 1 :PRBS23 = x^{23} + x^{18} + 1 :PRBS31 = x^{31} + x^{28} + 1 An example of generating a \\"PRBS-7\\" sequence can be expressed in C as #include #include #include int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { uint8_t start = 0x02; uint8_t a = start; int i; for (i = 1;; i++) { int newbit = (((a >> 6) ^ (a >> 5)) & 1); a = ((a << 1)  newbit) & 0x7f; printf(\\"%x \\", a); if (a  start) { printf(\\"repetition period is %d \\", i); break; } } } In this particular case, \\"PRBS-7\\" has a repetition period of 127 values.  Notation  The PRBSk or PRBS-k notation (such as \\"PRBS7\\" or \\"PRBS-7\\") gives an indication of the size of the sequence. N = 2^k - 1 is the maximum number of bits that are in the sequence. The k indicates the size of a unique word of data in the sequence. If you segment the N bits of data into every possible word of length k, you will be able to list every possible combination of 0s and 1s for a k-bit binary word, with the exception of the all-0s word. For example, PRBS3 = \\"1011100\\" could be generated from x^{3} + x^{2} + 1. If you take every sequential group of three bit words in the PRBS3 sequence (wrapping around to the beginning for the last few three-bit words), you will find the following 7 word arrangements: \\" _101_ 1100\\" -> 101 \\"1 _011_ 100\\" -> 011 \\"10 _111_ 00\\" -> 111 \\"101 _110_ 0\\" -> 110 \\"1011 _100_ \\" -> 100 \\" _1_ 0111 _00_ \\" -> 001 (requires wrap) \\" _10_ 1110 _0_ \\" -> 010 (requires wrap) Those 7 words are all of the 2^k - 1 = 2^3 - 1 = 7 possible non-zero 3-bit binary words, not in numeric order. The same holds true for any PRBSk, not just PRBS3.

Early life Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, circa 1838, by Carl Joseph Begas Augusta was the second daughter of Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Maria Pavlovna of Russia, a daughter of Paul I of Russia and Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg. While her father was an intellectually limited person, whose preferred reading up to the end of his life was fairy tales, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe spoke of Augusta's mother Marie as \\"one of the best and most significant women of her time.\\" Augusta received a comprehensive education, including drawing lessons from the court painter, Luise Seidler, as well as music lessons from the court bandmaster, Johann Nepomuk Hummel. Meeting with Wilhelm Augusta was only fifteen years old when, in 1826, she first met her future husband, Prince Wilhelm (William) who was more than fourteen years older than her. William thought the young Augusta had an \\"excellent personality,\\" yet was less attractive than her older sister Marie, whom William's younger brother, Karl (Charles), had already married. Above all, it was William's father who pressed him to consider Augusta as a potential wife. At this time, William was in love with the Polish Princess Elisa Radziwill. Nottingham Evening Post - Wednesday 8 January 1890 The Crown Prince at the time was William's elder brother, Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm (later King Frederick William IV). He and his wife Elisabeth Ludovika had been married three years and had no children. Although it was not anticipated that they would remain childless (which turned out to be the case), the court did expect that William, as heir presumptive to the throne, should make a dynastic marriage and produce further heirs. King Frederick William III was indulgent of the relationship between his son William and Elisa, but the Prussian court had discovered that her ancestors had purchased their princely title from Emperor Maximilian I, and she was not deemed noble enough to marry a potential King of Prussia.Nottingham Evening Post - Wednesday 08 January 1890 Ironically, Crown Princess Elisabeth Ludovika, who as a Bavarian princess was considered to be of correct rank, counted both Bogusław Radziwiłł and Janusz Radziwiłł among her ancestors, albeit through female descent. It was suggested by some courtiers that if Eliza Radziwill was adopted by a family of adequate rank, then a marriage with Prince William was possible. In 1824, the Prussians turned to the childless Alexander I of Russia to adopt Elisa, but the Russian Tsar declined. The second adoption plan by Elisa's uncle, Prince Augustus of Prussia, likewise failed because the responsible committee considered that adoption does not change \\"the blood.\\" Another factor was the Mecklenburg relations of the deceased Queen Louise's influence in the German and Russian courts (she was not fond of Elisa's father). Thus, in June 1826, William's father felt forced to demand the renunciation of a potential marriage to Elisa. Thus, William spent the next few months looking for a more suitable bride, but did not relinquish his emotional ties to Elisa. Eventually, William asked for Augusta's hand in marriage on 29 August (in writing and through the intervention of his father). Augusta agreed and on 25 October 1828, they were engaged. Historian Karin Feuerstein-Prasser has pointed out on the basis of evaluations of the correspondence between both fiancées, what different expectations William had of both marriages: He wrote to his sister Charlotte, the wife of Nicholas I of Russia, with reference to Elisa Radziwill: \\"One can love only once in life, really\\" and confessed with regard to Augusta, that \\"the Princess is nice and clever, but she leaves me cold.\\" Augusta liked her future husband and hoped for a happy marriage, in the end, it was an inwardly happy marriage despite outward appearances. On 11 June 1829, William married his fiancée in the chapel of Schloss Charlottenburg. Married life Princess Augusta of Prussia 1853. The first weeks of marriage were harmonious; Augusta was taken favorably in the Prussian King's court, however, Augusta soon started to be bored with its military sobriety, and most courtly duties (which may have counteracted this boredom) were reserved to her sister-in-law, Crown Princess Elisabeth. In a letter which William wrote on 22 January 1831 to his sister Charlotte, he has mixed feelings of his wife's \\"lack of femininity\\". Prince Friedrich (later Emperor Frederick III of Germany), was born later that year on 18 October 1831, three years after their marriage and Louise, was born on 3 December 1838, seven years later. Augusta as a politician Augusta was very interested in politics. Like so many other liberally-minded people of the time, she was hopeful regarding the accession of Frederick William IV, her brother-in-law, who was regarded as a potentially modern and open king. However, he refused to grant a constitution to Prussia and led a far more conservative government than was expected from his liberal ideals during his years as the crown prince. A \\"united Landtag\\" was created by the King in reaction to the crop failures and hunger revolts of 1847, but was dissolved a few months later. Prince William was held responsible for the bloodshed of the March revolution in 1848, in Berlin and on the advice of the King, William fled to London, and Augusta and their two children withdrew to Potsdam. In liberal circles, an idea was seriously discussed as to whether or not to force the King to abdicate, the Crown Prince renounce his rights to the throne, and instead have Augusta take up a regency for their son. Because the letters and diaries of that time were later destroyed by Augusta, it is not clear whether she seriously considered this option. After, in May 1848, 800 members of the German National Assembly met in the Frankfurter Paulskirche to discuss German unification and Prince William returned from London the following month. A year later, in 1849, he was appointed Governor-General of the Rhine Province and in the spring of 1850, he and Augusta took up residence in Koblenz. Life in Koblenz The Empress Augusta Monument in Koblenz Augusta enjoyed life in Koblenz and it was here that she could finally live out court life as she was accustomed to during her childhood in Weimar. Meanwhile, their son Friedrich (Frederick) studied nearby in Bonn and became the first Prussian prince to receive an academic education. Koblenz was subsequently visited by many liberal-minded contemporaries, including the historian Max Dunker and legal professors August von Bethmann-Hollweg, Clemens Theodor Pertes and Alexander von Schleinitz. Critically, Augusta's tolerance towards Catholicism at Koblenz (and throughout her lifetime) was scorned in Berlin and was felt inappropriate for a Prussian Protestant princess. In 1856 Augusta and William's only daughter, Princess Louise (then 17 years old), married Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden, and in 1858 their son Frederick married Princess Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Augusta saw this as a personal triumph and hoped her new daughter-in-law's liberal upbringing, particularly under Prince Albert, in a modern country like the United Kingdom would guide Frederick in the direction of a liberal monarchy at home. Return to Berlin In 1858, William became Regent after his brother was no longer able to lead his government due to suffering several strokes. He and Augusta traveled to the court at Berlin. William soon dismissed the old ministry when he succeeded his childless brother as king in 1861 and appointed liberal ministers of his own, notably from his own court at Koblenz, including: Alexander von Schleinitz, who became Foreign Secretary; August von Bethmann, who became Minister of Culture; and Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen who became Minister President of Prussia. The conservative opponents saw this as the work of Augusta, but her political influence on William was rather small. This became evident a few months later when he dissolved parliament, which was not bending to his will. The King appointed Otto von Bismarck as the new Prussian Minister President. Augusta, now Queen, regarded Bismarck as her mortal enemy and Bismarck likewise despised Augusta for her (albeit small) influence on her husband. Queen Victoria with Königin Augusta of Prussia in the gardens of Frogmore House, circa 1867. Augusta was particularly horrified at Bismarck's foreign policy and his cause in the commencement of the Austro- Prussian War. At the same time, she became more and more estranged from the king and Bismarck began to comment negatively on the Queen in parliament; the Queen reacted by being rude to Bismarck's wife, Johanna. The Queen soon began to suffer from her manic-depressive phases again and started making frequent trips to Baden-Baden, in search of a cure. At this time, the Prussian population was rejoicing in the victory at Königgrätz, but Augusta began mourning for the dead and injured. Augusta also became estranged from her daughter-in-law, Victoria who, contrary to custom, inherited the former Queen Elisabeth's jewelleries, which were supposed to be left to Augusta. Augusta, who clearly abhorred war, founded the National Women's Association in 1864, which looked after wounded and ill soldiers and convened with Florence Nightingale for ideas. Several hospital foundations exist today from Augusta's initiative, including the German Society of Surgery. Augusta was an avid supporter of the Red Cross movement, and the Augusta Fund at the International Committee of the Red Cross still exists today. German Empress Empress Augusta in old age, 1880s The Austro-Prussian War soon ended in 1866 but four years later, the Franco-Prussian War started in 1870 and Augusta continued to hold Bismarck personally responsible. However, the aftermath of the war left William as German Emperor and Augusta as German Empress. Augusta felt the Imperial Crown a personal defeat; she wanted the Prussian supremacy in Germany to succeed by \\"moral conquest\\" and not by bloodshed. Her opinion of the war was established by erecting an educational establishment in Potsdam in 1872, as \\"a home for the education of destitute daughters of German officers, military officials, priests and doctors from the field of honour as a result of the war of 1870-71.\\" Augusta buried her differences with Bismarck only after the war, as it seemed he was the only suitable man to support her beloved grandson, Wilhelm (William). However, the younger Wilhelm disliked Bismarck and soon forced him to resign during the first few years of his own reign. Last years Augusta had suffered from rheumatism for many years and in June 1881, she received heavy injuries from a fall which left her dependent on crutches and a wheelchair, but this did not hinder her from fulfilling her duties. She also renewed her vows with her husband on his 90th birthday in 1887, but he died a year later. Only 99 days later, her son, who had succeeded to the throne as Frederick III, succumbed to cancer of the larynx. She did, however, see her beloved grandson Wilhelm become king and emperor that year, but died a year later on 7 January 1890, aged 78, at the Altes Palais Unter den Linden during the 1889–1890 flu pandemic.

He surveyed as part of a 1736 expedition to settle a boundary dispute between Lord Fairfax and the English Privy Council concerning the extent of the vast Northern Neck land grant. Surveying the Northern Neck In 1736, three different survey expeditions were organized with all three having representatives of both the Colony of Virginia and of Lord Fairfax. One party was to explore and map the Potomac to its head; this included Major William Mayo and Mr Brookes for the Colony (and King) and Mr Winslow and John Savage for Fairfax. A second party was to explore and map the North Branch of the Rappahannock (Mr Wood, Mr Thomas, Jr) and the final party was to explore and map the South Branches (Rapidan and Conway Rivers) of the Rappahannock (Mr Graeme, Mr Thomas, Sr). All parties consisted of surveyors and commissioners and their works were completed in all three cases. The work of the three groups and the county surveyors lead to the preparation of a map of the Northern Neck in 1736 and 1737. This map shows the courses of the Potomac and Rappahannock and cites latitudes across the map. What the map does not show, however, is a western boundary line for the grant. A line connecting the head springs of the Potomac with those of the Rappahannock had yet to be surveyed. This was to be the work of Colonel Peter Jefferson and Thomas Lewis — the \\"Fairfax Line\\" party — in 1746 and 1747, which finally settled the disputed claims.

Both campuses, in Puxi and Pudong, offer Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Diploma's, as well as both programmes together to high school students. Activities Students participate in over 150 clubs, sports, and other activities including National English Honor Society, National Honor Society, Rho Kappa Honor Society, Model United Nations, International Thespian Society, and Tri-M Music Honor Society. SAS is a founding member of Asia Pacific Activities Conference (APAC), which comprises some of the largest international schools in Asia. Through APAC, SAS students participate in a variety of intramural recreations, including badminton, volleyball, band, choir, and theater. The school also co-founded the China Cup and Tri-Cities competitions. SAS students also participate in the China International Schools Sports Association (CISSA) League. History Early Decades SAS opened on September 17, 1912 with 38 students and a two- building campus in Shanghai's Hongkou neighborhood, north of the Bund. The school was originally intended to serve \\"the children of American missionaries and other European residents in the East\\" but quickly established a reputation for academic excellence, and within a decade, the campus had grown to include twelve buildings on or near North Sichuan Road. With the support of the American business community in Shanghai and abroad, SAS broke ground on a purpose-built campus located amid farmland on the western edge of \\"Frenchtown\\" (today's former French Concession). In 1923, SAS moved to a new campus located on Avenue Petain (now Hengshan Road), whose administration building was modeled after Philadelphia's Independence Hall. (It can still be seen along Hengshan Road; the Girl's Dormitory and Water Tower also remain but are not visible from the road.) Over the next two decades, SAS's fortunes echoed those of its host city of Shanghai – from the prosperous days of the mid-‘20s and ‘30s to the challenging times of war in 1927, 1932, and 1937. In 1941, faced with a declining foreign population and with a world war growing in scope, the SAS Board of Managers made the decision to close the school. Bootleg SAS Upon hearing of the Board’s decision, a SAS teacher named Frank \\"Unk\\" Cheney declared the school must go on. He gathered remaining faculty, staff, and equipment and continued SAS under a series of different names. He called them \\"Bootleg SAS.\\" Bootleg SAS operated out of the SAS campus on Hengshan Road, as well as in the Community Church across the street (still an active church at 53 Hengshan Road). In 1943, Cheney and most of the SAS population were forced into Chapei Civilian Assembly Camp, a Japanese-run internment camp. Still not content to see the school cease operations, Cheney packed thousands of books and brought them to internment camp so school could go on. Housed in an open- air shed with the most rudimentary supplies, the newest iteration of Bootleg SAS nevertheless opened with 222 students. At the end of World War II, the SAS Board of Managers vowed to re-open SAS in the fall of 1946. Unwilling to wait an additional year, Cheney opened yet another Bootleg SAS in the fall of 1945 to serve students until SAS could officially open the following fall. Post- WWII At SAS, the period of 1946-49 saw the return of old traditions, sports and arts programs. The school and its campus were even featured in LIFE magazine. But by 1949, with China at the end of a civil war and Shanghai about to be invaded by the Communist Party, the SAS Board of Managers once again made the decision to close the school. With Unk Cheney no longer on staff, a vice principal named Val Sundt was inspired to invoke the \\"Spirit of Cheney\\" and assure the school would once again continue. Sundt founded the final Bootleg SAS in 1949–50, called Private American School. At the conclusion of the school year in May 1950, Sundt closed the school's doors, and the remaining SAS teachers and students heeded the warnings of the U.S. State Department and departed Shanghai. The Re-founding In January 1980, encouraged by the reformist efforts of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, the U.S. re- established its Consulate in Shanghai. One of the Consulate's first employees, economics advisor Tom Lauer, brought his wife, Linnea, and three children to Shanghai. Recognizing a need to educate the children of Consulate employees, the U.S. State Department asked Mrs. Lauer to restart Shanghai American School. SAS re-opened on the U.S. Consulate grounds on Huai Hai Road in September 1980. It remained there until outgrowing the space in 1989. The Shanghai Girls #3 School, one of Shanghai's most reputable schools, with an alumni list that includes China's famous Soong sisters, agreed to share space with SAS. With a booming foreign population coming into Shanghai, a SAS education was in heavy demand and in spite of building additional buildings and floors, it wasn't long before SAS had again outgrown its space. Pit Stop Campus Era By the mid-1990s, SAS had decided to build not one but two purpose- built campuses – one on each side of Shanghai's Huangpu River. Before the campus construction could be completed, the school needed to move once again. Three temporary campuses were established. In Puxi, a semi-built cultural center in Zhudi Town was reassigned to the school. In Pudong, another cultural center – Huaxia – was selected to be SAS’ first presence on the Pudong side of the Huangpu River. A third temporary campus was founded in the Shanghai Centre on Nanjing Road to serve the youngest SAS attendees, though it soon proved unnecessary and closed after just one semester. Facilities during this time in SAS history were makeshift at best. The school's swim team held competitions at Shanghai's Holiday Inn, and storefronts across from campus served as classrooms. Ignoring the challenges of the times, the school laid plans for a brighter future. SAS became a co-founder of the region's Asia Pacific Athletic Conference (APAC), in spite of having no athletics facilities at the time. Modern-day SAS In 1998, the Pudong campus opened on the shores of the East China Sea. In 2000, the Puxi campus opened in the heart of the Minhang district. In 2017, James Mikkelson, a veteran English teacher at the Puxi campus, was fired after being found in possession of pornography on his school computer and exchanging explicit messages with former students. He was also the subject of numerous sexual misconduct allegations.https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5NzEzNjEwNA%3D%3D∣=2247488096&idx;=2&sn;=d1c795c99807d42da2b1702623e12184&chksm;=90a42ee7a7d3a7f1a21ef39b283d3678db916a9e3a4f5dd7db1199c278c345c8f373a167675f#rd  See also  * List of international schools in Shanghai * Americans in China ReferencesExternal links * Shanghai American School website * Profile at the Good Schools Guide International * Shanghai American School Educational Programs Blog * SAS Pudong's school profile on Time Out Shanghai Family * SAS Puxi's school profile on Time Out Shanghai Family Category:American international schools in China Category:Educational institutions established in 1912 Category:International schools in Shanghai Category:International Baccalaureate schools in China Category:Association of China and Mongolia International Schools Category:EARCOS Category:1912 establishments in China Category:Schools in Pudong ","title":"Shanghai American School"},{"id":"2006927","text":"Prince Oskar Karl Gustav Adolf of Prussia (Oskar Karl Gustav Adolf Prinz von Preußen; 27 July 1888 – 27 January 1958) was the fifth son of Wilhelm II, German Emperor and Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg- Augustenburg. Biography Prinz Oskar was born on July 27, 1888, a month after his father had become the German Emperor. =Education= Prinz Oskar was educated as a cadet at Plön, in his mother’s ancestral Schleswig-Holstein, as his brothers had been before him. He made the news in 1902 when he fractured his collar bone after a fall from the horizontal bars.“Kaiser’s Fifth Son Hurt.” New York Times. December 9, 1902. =Military career= During the early months of the First World War, he commanded Grenadierregiment \\"König Wilhelm I.\\" (2. Westpreussisches) Nr. 7 in the field as its colonel. Future fighter ace Manfred von Richthofen witnessed the 22 August 1914, attack on Virton, Belgium, and wrote of Prinz Oskar’s bravery and his inspirational leadership at the front of his regiment as they went into combat.Kilduff, Peter. The Life and Death of an Ace. Cincinnati, OH: David & Charles, LTD., 2007. p. 34. For this action, Oskar earned the Iron Cross, Second Class.\\"Kaiser Decorates 2 Sons for Bravery.\\" New York Times. August 26, 1914. A month later, at Verdun, Oskar again led his men in a successful assault into heavy combat, and was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class. After this action, he also collapsed and had to be removed from the field.\\"Von Der Horst Killed Leading His Troops.\\" New York Times. October 3, 1914. Awarded the wound badge for his injuries, he spent much of the fall of 1914 recovering from what was reported to be a heart condition. He eventually returned to duty and served on the Eastern Front, where he was again awarded the wound badge.\\"Kaiser's Son Oscar is Wounded Again.\\" New York Times. February 8, 1916. In the early 1920s, his name was listed with other members of the general staff or the royal family accused of war crimes, and was condemned in the Press for applying for a colonel’s pension from the Weimar Republic.“Princes Seek Pensions.” New York Times (reprinted from Chicago Tribune), August 20, 1922. During the 1930s, when the Hohenzollern family attempted to test the waters for a return to power through Nationalist Socialism, Oskar appears to have played along, and eventually was commissioned at Generalmajor zur Verfügung (rank equivalent to brigadier general, \\"available for assignment\\"), circa March 1, 1940. As the family fell out of favor with Hitler (with the exception of Oskar’s middle brother, August Wilhelm), it became evident that there would be no restoration of the monarchy through the Nazis. With the early battlefield deaths of Oskar’s son (also named Oskar, killed in Poland, September 1939) and his nephew (Wilhelm, son of the Crown Prince, died of wounds received in France, May 1940) the German people harbored a newfound sentiment for the royal family amidst the totalitarian regime that was Nazi Germany. As a consequence, the majority of royals serving in the German Armed Forces appear to have had their commissions canceled, including Prinz Oskar. =Master of Knights, Protestant Order of Saint John= Prinz Oskar (center) in procession with the Johanniterorden, 1924 The Johanniterorden (The Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)) was a favorite of the Hohenzollerns, historically, and of Prince Oskar’s immediate family specifically. His father and uncle were members, and his brother, Eitel Friedrich, served as its Master of Knights (Herrenmeister), from 1907 to 1926. Prinz Oskar served as the thirty-fifth Master of Knights Robert M. Clark, Jr., The Evangelical Knights of Saint John; Dallas, Texas: 2003; pp. 41-53, 111. from Eitel Friedrich's resignation in 1926 until his death in 1958. Modern historians credit Prinz Oskar for saving the ancient order from oblivion during the cultural purges of the Nazi regime. It is from this struggle that he held his anti-Nazi sentiments. After his death in 1958, his youngest son, Prinz Wilhelm Karl, became his permanent successor. Prinz Oskar's grandson and namesake, Dr. Oskar Hohenzollern, is the current (thirty-seventh) Master of Knights. =Marriage and issue= Prinz Oskar was married on 31 July 1914 to Countess Ina-Marie Helene Adele Elise von Bassewitz (27 January 1888 – 17 September 1973). On 27 July 1914, prior to the wedding, Ina Marie was granted the title \\"Countess von Ruppin\\". Both the civil and religious ceremonies took place at Schloß Bellevue near Berlin, Prussia. Initially the union was a morganatic marriage, but on 3 November 1919 was decreed to be dynastic in accordance with the house laws of the Royal House of Hohenzollern. Henceforth, from 21 June 1920, his wife was titled \\"Princess of Prussia\\" with the style Royal Highness. The couple had four children: Prince Oskar and Princess Ina Marie with their children in 1925. * Prince Oskar Wilhelm Karl Hans Kuno of Prussia (12 July 1915 Potsdam – 5 September 1939 Poland); died in World War II. * Prince Burchard Friedrich Max Werner Georg of Prussia (8 January 1917 – 12 August 1988), married Countess Eleonore Fugger von Babenhausen on 30 January 1961, no issue. * Princess Herzeleide of Prussia (25 December 1918 – 22 March 1989), married Karl, Prince Biron von Kurland on 15 August 1938, with issue. * Prince Wilhelm-Karl of Prussia (20 January 1922 – 9 April 2007), married Irmgard von Veltheim on 1 March 1952, with issue.

The district operates 44 distinct campuses, consisting of 6 composite high schools, 10 intermediate schools, 26 elementary schools, and 3 alternative campuses. Since January 2008, the Superintendent of Schools has been Dr. Greg Smith. Clear Creek ISD currently operates two football stadiums, Veterans Memorial Stadium and Challenger Columbia Stadium, both of which serve all five of the district's 6A high schools.  History  Clear Creek ISD was formed in 1948 when the districts of Kemah, League City, Seabrook, and Webster were consolidated, deriving its name from nearby Clear Creek, which forms Clear Lake, one of the few natural lakes in Texas. CCISD continued operating Webster High School until Clear Creek High School opened in 1957.

He was a vocal supporter of Nazism and of Adolf Hitler. Early life He was born in the Potsdamer Stadtschloss when his grandfather was still the Crown Prince of Prussia. He spent his youth with his siblings at the New Palace, also in Potsdam, and his school days at the Prinzenhaus in Plön. Later, he studied at the universities of Bonn, Berlin and Strasbourg. He received his doctorate in political science in 1907 \\"in an exceedingly dubious manner\\", as one author describes it. Prince August Wilhelm married his cousin Princess Alexandra Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (21 April 1887 Germany – 15 April 1957 France) on 22 October 1908 at the Berliner Stadtschloss. The couple had planned to take up residence in Schönhausen Palace in Berlin, but changed their mind when August Wilhelm's father decided to leave his son the Villa Liegnitz in the Sanssouci Park. On 26 December 1912 their only child, Prince Alexander Ferdinand of Prussia (died 12 June 1985), was born. Their Potsdam residence developed into a meeting place for artists and scholars. During the First World War, August Wilhelm was made district administrator (Landrat) of the district of Ruppin; his office and residence was now Schloss Rheinsberg. His personal adjutant Hans Georg von Mackensen, with whom he had been close friends since his youth, played an important role in his life. These \\"pronounced homophilic tendencies\\" contributed to the failure of his marriage to Princess Alexandra Victoria. They never undertook a formal divorce due to the opposition of August Wilhelm's father, Kaiser Wilhelm II. Weimar Republic Initially, many Allied and German leaders favored transitioning Germany to a constitutional monarchy with August Wilhelm as either Emperor or regent for one of Crown Prince Wilhelm's children, although this possibility was quickly precluded when Philipp Scheidemann was forced by the pressures of the German Revolution to declare a republic. Winston Churchill, who at the time served as Secretary of State for War in the Lloyd George War Cabinet, blamed the failure to retain the monarchy for the political instability that would plague the Weimar Republic. After the end of the war, the couple separated and formally divorced in March 1920. August Wilhelm was awarded custody of their son. After his divorce and the marriage of his friend Hans Georg von Mackensen to Winifred von Neurath, the daughter of Konstantin von Neurath, August Wilhelm lived a reclusive life in his villa in Potsdam. He took drawing lessons with Arthur Kampf, and the sale of his pictures secured him an additional source of income. Involvement with National Socialism August Wilhelm joined the conservative nationalist veterans group (English: \\"The Steel helmet\\"). In the following years he had increasing contact with the Nazi Party (NSDAP). To the unease of his family and against his father's will, he joined the \\"dangerous, revolutionary\\" NSDAP on 1 April 1930, whereupon he received the low membership number 24, for symbolic reasons. In November 1931, he was accepted into the paramilitary (SA) with the rank of . His involvement with the NSDAP and his adoration of Adolf Hitler made August Wilhelm often the subject of mockery by the left-wing press (who gave him the nickname , or \\"Auwi the Little Brown Shirt\\"), politicians (the French Ambassador André François-Poncet called him , i.e. \\"Hans the Brown Sausage\\"), and from National Socialists themselves (Joseph Goebbels referred to him as a \\"good-natured, but slightly gormless boy\\"). As a representative of the erstwhile Hohenzollern Dynasty, August Wilhelm was deliberately used by the Nazis to gain votes in elections such as the lead candidate of the NSDAP for election to the Prussian parliament in April 1932 or as an election speaker alongside Hitler, whom he accompanied on flights across Germany at the same time. Through his appearances at mass rallies of the NSDAP, he addressed himself to sections of the population that were lukewarm towards National Socialism and convinced them \\"that Hitler was not a threat, but a benefactor of the German people and the German Empire\\". In 1933 August Wilhelm was given a position within the Free State of Prussia, and became a member of the German Reichstag. However, after the abolition of the Weimar Republic with the passing of the Enabling Act of 1933, and the establishment of the dictatorship of the Third Reich, the Nazis no longer needed the former prince, who himself had secretly hoped \\"that Hitler would one day hoist him or his son Alexander up to the vacant throne of the Kaiser\\". Thus in spring 1934 he was denied direct access to Hitler and by the summer after the Night of the Long Knives, he found himself in the wilderness politically. This did not, however, reduce his adoration of Hitler. One high-profile visit took August Wilhelm to the Passau Hall of the Nibelungs ().Anna Rosmus Hitler's Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 113ff On 30 June 1939 he was made an SA-Obergruppenführer, the second highest rank in the SA, but after making derogatory remarks about Joseph Goebbels in private, he was denounced in 1942. From then on, he was completely sidelined and was also banned from making public speeches. At the beginning of February 1945, in the company of the former Crown Princess Cecilie, August Wilhelm fled the approaching Red Army, going from Potsdam to Kronberg to take refuge with his aunt Princess Margaret of Prussia, a sister of his father. Post-war life At the end of the Second World War, on 8 May 1945, August Wilhelm was arrested by the U.S. Army and imprisoned in Ludwigsburg. At his denazification trial () in 1948, he was asked if he had since repudiated National Socialism, and replied: \\"I beg your pardon?\\" He was thus categorized as \\"incriminated\\" by the denazification process and sentenced to two and a half years' hard labour. However, as he had been confined in the Ludwigsburg internment camp since 1945, he was considered to have served his sentence. Immediately after his release, new proceedings were instituted against August Wilhelm. A court in Potsdam, in the Soviet occupation zone, issued an arrest warrant against him, but soon after that he became seriously ill and died at a hospital in Stuttgart at the age of 62. He was buried in Langenburg in the cemetery of the princes of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. With his wife, Princess Alexandra of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, Prince August Wilhelm had one son: *Prince Alexander Ferdinand Albrecht Achilles Wilhelm Joseph Viktor Carl Feodor of Prussia (26 December 1912 – 12 June 1985), who married Armgard Weygand on 19 December 1938. They had one son, Prince Stephan Alexander Dieter Friedrich of Prussia (1939-1993); he had one daughter, Princess Stephanie Victoria-Louise of Prussia (born 1966).

Life and activities On 27 February 1906, Prince Eitel married Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Oldenburg (2 February 1879 Oldenburg – 29 March 1964 Westerstede) in Berlin. They were divorced on 20 October 1926 on the grounds of her adultery before the war. They had no children. Raised at the cadet corps of Plön Castle, Prince Eitel was in the front line from the beginning of World War I and was wounded at Bapaume, where he commanded the Prussian First Foot Guards. He temporarily relinquished command to Count Hans von Blumenthal, but returned to duty before the end of the year. The following year, he was transferred to the Eastern Front. During the summer of 1915, he was out in a field in Russia when he had a chance encounter with Manfred von Richthofen, who had just crashed with his superior officer, Count Holck. The two men were hiding in a nearby tree line from what they thought was the advancing Russian army and who turned out to be the grenadiers, guardsmen, and officers of Prince Eitel. After the war, he was engaged in monarchist circles and Der Stahlhelm ex-servicemens' organization. In 1921, the Berlin criminal court found him guilty of the fraudulent transfer of 300,000 Marks and sentenced him to a fine of 5000 Marks.Tucholsky: Awrumele Schabbesdeckel und Prinz Eitel- Friedrich von Hohenzollern at www.textlog.de From 1907 to 1926, he was Master of the Knights (Herrenmeister) of the Order of St. John (Johanniterorden).

Ono was appointed by Empress Suiko as an official envoy (Kenzuishi) to the Sui court in 607 (Imperial embassies to China), and he delivered the famous letter from Japan's Prince Shōtoku which began \\"The Son of Heaven where the sun rises [Japan], to the Son of Heaven where the sun sets [China], may good health be with you.\\" Emperor Yang was angered at being addressed in this way, although it is not clear whether he was angered more by the insult of Sui being referred to as the land of the setting sun, or by the use of Son of Heaven to refer both to himself and the emperor of Japan, hinting that they were equals, when China considered the Yamato state of Japan to be nothing more than an insignificant barbarian state. Nevertheless, Emperor Yang was probably more interested in obtaining Japan's support in his campaigns against Goguryeo than in matters of decorum, and despite the insult, he sent his own envoy, Pei Shiqing (裴世清), back to Japan with Ono. Ono was then appointed envoy to Sui for a second time in the fall of 608 and accompanied Pei Shiqing on his return trip to China. Ono returned to Japan from his second mission in 609 and then largely disappeared from the historical record. Ono no Imoko is often cited as an example of an official who achieved promotion under the new meritorious Twelve Level Cap and Rank System implemented by Prince Shōtoku in 603. When Ono first appeared in the historical record and was appointed envoy to Sui, his rank was listed as Greater Propriety (5th rank), but he was later promoted to the top rank of Greater Virtue, largely due to his successful missions to the Sui court. Ono no Imoko's family was notable for linguistics and scholarship, and the descendants of the family include Ono no Komachi, beautiful female poet; Ono no Takamura, poet and scholar; and Ono no Michikaze, calligrapher.

He wrote this work for the Belgian cellist, viola da gamba player and instrument maker Auguste Tolbecque. Tolbecque was part of a distinguished family of musicians closely associated with the Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, France's leading concert society. The concerto was first performed on January 19, 1873 at the Paris conservatoire concert with Tolbecque as soloist. This was considered a mark of Saint-Saëns' growing acceptance by the French musical establishment. Sir Donald Francis Tovey later wrote \\"Here, for once, is a violoncello concerto in which the solo instrument displays every register without the slightest difficulty in penetrating the orchestra.\\" Many composers, including Shostakovich and Rachmaninoff, considered this concerto to be the greatest of all cello concertos. Yo-Yo Ma's recording of five \\"Great Cello Concertos\\" includes Dvořák's, Elgar's, one of Haydn's, Saint-Saëns' first, and Schumann's.https://www.yo-yoma.com/sounds-symphonies-archive/great-cello- concertos/  Structure and Overview  Saint-Saëns broke with convention in writing the concerto. Instead of using the normal three-movement concerto form, he structured the piece in one continuous movement. This single movement contains three distinct sections. Those sections, tightly-structured, share interrelated ideas. Saint-Saëns' contact with Franz Liszt while serving as organist at the Église de la Madeleine may have led him to use cyclic form in his orchestral works. Along with the solo cello, the concerto is scored for an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings. The work can be split into three different sections as follows: # Allegro non troppo #:The concerto begins unusually. Instead of the traditional orchestral introduction, the piece begins with one short chord from the orchestra. The cello follows, stating the main motif. Soon, countermelodies flow from both the orchestra and soloist, at times the two playfully \\"calling and answering\\" each other. # Allegretto con moto #:This turbulent opening movement leads into a brief but highly original minuet, in which the strings are muted, and which contains a cello cadenza. # Tempo primo #:A restatement of the opening material from the first movement opens the finale. Saint-Saëns introduces two new themes but also includes the recapitulation of the fourth theme from the first movement, tying the whole design together. After a final restatement of the opening theme, he concludes by introducing an entirely new idea for the cello. Saint-Saëns very often uses the solo cello here as a declamatory instrument. This keeps the soloist in the dramatic and musical foreground, the orchestra offering a shimmering backdrop. The music is tremendously demanding for soloists, especially in the fast third section. This difficulty has not stopped the concerto from becoming a favourite of the great virtuoso cellists. ew Dynamics { s4\\\\f } ew Staff = \\"down\\" \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } { \\\\relative c { \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"cello\\" \\\\accidentalStyle \\"modern\\" 2.^\\\\marcato 4  q  **  4\\\\. q8 4\\\\. q8  4 q2-> 4   **  4\\\\. 8 4\\\\. q8  4 r r  r \\\\arpeggio r  r r  r \\\\arpeggio r  }} >> ;2nd movement theme (B major) : ew StaffGroup << ew Staff { \\\\relative c { \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\mark \\\\markup \\\\sans F \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"pizzicato strings\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Allegretto con moto\\" 4 = 108 \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #208 \\\\bar \\"\\" \\\\time 3/4 r4 r f-.\\\\pp  es8-. f-. g-. es-. g4-.  g-. f-. d-.  es-. \\\\acciaccatura { f8 } es8-. d-. es4-.  es2 f4-.  es8-. f-. g-. es-. g4-.  g-. f-. d-.  es-. \\\\acciaccatura { f8 } es8-. d-. es4-.  d2 }} ew Staff { \\\\relative c { \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"pizzicato strings\\" r4 r\\\\pp << { bes-.  bes8-. bes-. bes-. bes-. bes4-.  bes-. bes-. bes-.  bes-. bes8-. bes-. bes4-.  bes2 bes4-.  bes8-. bes-. bes-. bes-. bes4-.  bes-. bes-. bes-.  bes-. g-. a-.  bes2 }  { f4-.  f8-. f-. f-. f-. f4-.  f-. f-. f-.  f-. f8-. f-. f4-.  f2 f4-.  f8-. f-. f-. f-. f4-.  f-. f-. f-.  f-. r f-.  f2 } >> }} ew Staff { \\\\relative c' { \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\clef alto \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"pizzicato strings\\" r4 r d-.\\\\pp  c8-. d-. es-. c-. es4-.  es-. d-. bes-.  c-. \\\\acciaccatura { d8 } c8-. bes-. c4-.  c2 d4-.  c8-. d-. es-. c-. es4-.  es-. d-. bes-.  c-. r f,-.  bes2 }} >> ;3rd movement, 1st theme (A minor) : \\\\relative c' ew Staff { \\\\key a \\\\minor \\\\clef tenor \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"cello\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Un peu moins vite\\" 2 = 50 \\\\mark \\\\markup \\\\sans K % H = 372 \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #412 \\\\bar \\"\\" r2 e8\\\\p( a4 g8)  c,( f4 e8) a,( d4 c8)  \\\\times 2/3 { c( b a } b4 ~ b8) b( c d)  \\\\times 2/3 { f( e dis } e4 ~ e8) fis( gis a)  b4(-> e,) e8( a4 g8)  c,( f4 e8) a,( d4 c8)  \\\\times 2/3 { c( b a } b4 ~ b8) b( cis dis)  \\\\times 2/3 { fis( e dis } e4 ~ e8)\\\\< fis( g a)  b2(\\\\> ~ b8\\\\\\\\! a e fis)  g-- fis-- e2( dis4)  e1 ~  e ~  e2 } ;3rd movement, 2nd theme (F major) : \\\\relative c, ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } { \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"cello\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 2 = 64 \\\\mark \\\\markup \\\\sans O \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #505 \\\\bar \\"\\" c4\\\\\\\\((\\\\mf f a c)  des( g f e)  f->( a, c des)  c2 ~ c8\\\\\\\\) r r4  c,( f a c  des g f e)  f( a, c \\\\acciaccatura { es8 } des4->)  c2 ~ c8\\\\\\\\) r r4  \\\\break \\\\set tupletSpannerDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1 2) \\\\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f es,2(-> d) ~  \\\\times 2/3 { d4 fis(-. a-. d-. fis-. a-.) }  c2( bes ~  bes4) r r2  f,2(-> e) ~  \\\\times 2/3 { e4 gis-.( b-. } e8-. gis-. b-. d-.)  d2( c)  } ;3rd movement, 3rd theme (A major) : \\\\relative c' ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } { \\\\key a \\\\major \\\\clef tenor \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"cello\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"(Molto allegro)\\" 2 = 108 \\\\mark \\\\markup \\\\sans R \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #621 \\\\bar \\"\\" r2 cis4\\\\mf( d)  dis( e a gis)  g( d b cis)  d( e8 d cis4 b)  fis'2( e4 dis)  fis( e d! cis)  e( d a b)  cis2( e4. d8  cis4) } }} Recordings * André Navarra, cello, Orchestre de L'Association des Concerts Lamoureux, conducted by Charles Munch.

Founded by Alexander \\"Lex\\" Kaplen, who worked at The New Yorker, Wigwag eschewed celebrity coverage in favor of personal and literary writing. A test issue was put on newsstands in the summer of 1988, and the magazine formally debuted in October 1989. The magazine attracted writers such as Peter Matthiessen, Terry McMillan, Garry Wills, Alex Heard, Sousa Jamba and Nancy Franklin, but despite a circulation of 120,000, and despite being financially successful, ceased publication when the Gulf War broke out in 1991 and the economy entered a recession. It published its last issue in February 1991. In its brief lifetime it reached a circulation of close to 200,000 and became a brand name signifying family-feeling and an appreciation of the qualities of non- metropolitan America. The legend of Wigwag's founding by a group of young exiles from The New Yorker – an exodus which followed The New Yorker's acquisition by Conde Nast and Conde Nast's subsequent dismissal of The New Yorker's longtime editor William Shawn – attracted an enormous amount of attention to its launch and early publication. Once launched, it quickly became a success d'estime, and critics often called it the \\"Anti-Spy\\" – in reference to the funny, cruel and cynical New York magazine of that name. Many saw the two magazines as rivals for media attention – neither survived the 1991 recession (although Spy lingered on in a brief afterlife). Contemporary observers thought that the \\"parent ship,\\" The New Yorker itself, then edited by Robert Gottlieb, also saw itself as threatened by Wigwag during Wigwag's lifetime. Wigwag proposed a kind of counter-reality to the sophistication which magazines like The New Yorker and Spy aspired to – offering, instead of The New Yorker's famed \\"Talk of the Town\\" section, its own titled opening section, \\"Letters from Home.\\" Notable staffers at Wigwag include Nancy Holyoke, who went on (with the help of Harriet Brown, another Wigwag editor, now a professor at the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications) to found American Girl magazine at Pleasant Company in Wisconsin, Caroline Fraser, the author of a noted history of the Christian Science Church, and Evan Cornog, now dean of the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University. One of the most significant contributors to Wigwag's identity was its art director, the illustrator and designer Paul Davis. Many have observed that Wigwag's editorial and design innovations under Kaplen and Davis were later adopted by Tina Brown and implemented at The New Yorker when she became its editor.

It was incorporated in 1846 as the Cape Cod Branch Railroad to provide a rail link from the Fall River Railroad line in Middleborough to Cape Cod.  Cape Cod Branch Railroad, 1846–1853  Among the proponents of the Cape Cod Branch Railroad were Col. Richard Borden of Fall River, who saw the new line as an opportunity to bring more traffic and business through his hometown. He was at one time president of the Bay State Steamboat Company, which together with the Old Colony Railroad formed the noted \\"Fall River Line\\". He was later elected president of the Cape Cod Railroad. On January 26, 1848, the first segment of the railroad was opened between Middleborough and Wareham. By May 1848 an additional was opened to Sandwich, enabling unimpeded transit between Boston and Sandwich, thus serving the needs of the Boston & Sandwich Glass Company. In 1853, the extension of the line to Hyannis was started, reaching West Barnstable on December 22, 1853.  Cape Cod Railroad, 1854–1872  On February 22, 1854, the Cape Cod Branch Railroad was renamed the Cape Cod Railroad Company.Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners, Feb 15, 1911, page 415 In the spring of 1854, construction continued, with the railroad reaching Barnstable village May 8, Yarmouth Port May 19, and finally Hyannis on July 8, 1854. Connecting steamboat service to Nantucket commenced from Hyannis in late September and would continue until 1872. = Acquisitions = In 1868, the Cape Cod Railroad acquired the Cape Cod Central Railroad (1861–68), which had opened a line from Yarmouth to Orleans in 1865. In 1871, the Cape Cod Railroad bought the Plymouth and Vineyard Sound Railroad – which had been incorporated in 1861 as the Vineyard Sound Railroad Company intending to build a line from Buzzards Bay to Woods Hole. However, the road to Woods Hole was not completed until July 1872, after the merger with the Cape Cod Railroad. Upon completion of that road, the steamboat service to Nantucket moved to Woods Hole.  Old Colony Railroad, 1872–1893  By this time, the Cape Cod Railroad had merged with the Old Colony and Newport Railway to form a new company, renamed the Old Colony Railroad. The Cape Cod routes became known as the \\"Cape Cod Division\\" of the Old Colony Railroad, with its headquarters in Hyannis. With much fanfare, the Old Colony Railroad completed the line to Provincetown in July 1873.  New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, 1893–1959  The lines of the Cape Cod Railroad became part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NYNH&H;) in 1893, when it leased the entire Old Colony Railroad network. The NYNH&H; ended daily passenger service to southeastern Massachusetts and the Cape in 1959. The railroad did, however, restore the popular seasonal rail service from New York, with connections from Boston, during the 1960 through 1964 summer seasons. The New Haven's passenger service to Cape Cod was operated under a number of different names, including and Day Cape Codder, the Night Cape Codder, the Neptune, the Islander, and the Flying Dude. Later A Cape Cod Railroad excursion train and the Cape Codder at West Barnstable in 1995 Between 1986 and 1996, Amtrak operated the Cape Codder during summer weekends from New York City to Hyannis. Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad provided seasonal service between Braintree and Hyannis from 1984 through 1988. Beginning in 1989, the Bay Colony Railroad operated seasonal heritage railroad excursions from Hyannis to Sagamore under the Cape Cod Railroad brand. In 1999, the Cape Cod Central Railroad began operating the service. Seasonal CapeFLYER service by the CCRTA and MBTA began in 2013.

His father was part owner and president of a crucible steel company. He majored in English and philosophy at Harvard University. With his wife Louise (born as Mary Louise Stevens, 1879–1953), he collected art and supported artistic endeavors. Early life and career Walter Arensberg was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the oldest child of Conrad Christian Arensberg and his second wife, Flora Belle Covert. Walter's father was President and partial owner of a successful Pittsburgh crucible steel company. Between 1896 and 1900, Walter attended Harvard University. Following graduation, he traveled to Europe, where he spent at least two years. In 1903, he returned to Harvard, as a graduate student. He did not complete his degree, but rather moved to New York City to work as a cub reporter from 1904-1906. Arensberg's first major book, The Cryptography of Dante (1921) was greeted as a literary scandal because of its deeply Freudian interpretation of the text. A full-page review appeared in The New York Evening Journal with the title \\"A Shocking Attack on Dante's immortal 'Inferno'.\\"\\" A Shocking Attack on Dante's Immortal 'Inferno',\\" The New York Evening Journal, January 21, 1922. This book was followed by The Cryptography of Shakespeare (1922), which finds acrostics and anagrams in the published works of Shakespeare that reveal the embedded name of Francis Bacon. In The secret grave of Francis Bacon and his mother in the Lichfield chapter house (1923) and The Shakespearean mystery (1928) he used a \\"key cipher\\" to find further messages connected with the Rosicrucians. Analysis by William Friedman and Elizebeth FriedmanWilliam and Elizebeth Friedman, The Shakespearean ciphers examined, Cambridge University Press, 1957. Chapter X. shows that none of the methods has cryptographic validity. Several volumes of his Symbolist- influenced verse were also published, including 1914's Poems and 1916's Idols. His poem Voyage a l'Infini was anthologized by Edmund Clarence Stedman. His far more adventurous, avant-garde poetry appeared in Dada magazines between 1917 and 1919: Rogue, The Blind Man, 391, TNT.Francis M.

Stendahl. The Arensbergs became particularly close with Duchamp, who lived in their apartment during the summer of 1915 while they vacationed at their summer home in Pomfret, Connecticut. They would become the artist's lifelong patrons and form the largest, most significant collection of his work.Arensberg Archives: Historical Note Philadelphia Museum of Art. When Duchamp's idea to dispatch his 1917 work Fountain, an ordinary bathroom urinal signed with the pseudonym \\"R.

California years In 1921, for health and financial reasons and upon Louise's insistence, the couple relocated to Hollywood, California. While the move was originally intended to be temporary, the Arensbergs remained in California for the rest of their lives, returning to New York for only a year between 1925 and 1926. They first lived in Residence A, a guest house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright on Olive Hill, a property owned by Aline Barnsdall. for a time. In September 1927, the Arensbergs purchased their permanent home on 7065 Hillside Avenue, an example of Mediterranean Revival architecture built in 1920 for Lee B. Memefee and designed by architect William Lee Woollett; they later commissioned architect Richard Neutra to build an addition to house Constantin Brâncuși's bronze version of L'Oiseau dans l'espace (1924). In 1946, Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning were married at the home in a double wedding with Juliet Browner and Man Ray.http://www.philamuseum.org/pma_archives/ead.php?c=WLA&p;=hn Dorothea Tanning, Birthday (1942) Philadelphia Museum of Art. Walter served as a board member of the Los Angeles Art Association (1937), Los Angeles County Museum of Art (1938–1939), and the Southwest Museum (1944–1954). In addition, he was a founding board member of the short-lived American Arts in Action (1943) and the Modern Institute of Art, Beverly Hills (1947–1949), organizations dedicated to showing modern art in California. Francis Bacon Foundation Intrigued with writer Francis Bacon, particularly the aspects of alchemy, cryptography, Rosicrucianism, and, inevitably, the Shakespeare-Bacon debate, the Arensbergs researched his work. In 1937 they established the Francis Bacon Foundation in Los Angeles intending to promote \\"research in history, philosophy, science, literature, and art, with special reference to the life and works of Francis Bacon\\" and in 1954 endowed it with funds and their collection of Baconiana. The Foundation's library was housed in its own small brick building at the Claremont Colleges beginning in 1960. In the intervening years, the collection grew from its original 3,500 volumes to over 16,000 volumes. With the failing health of the collection's longtime librarian and curator, Elizabeth Wrigley, the Foundation decided to transfer it to the Huntington Library in San Marino. The collection is now known as the Francis Bacon Foundation Arensberg Collection. Legacy In the 1940s the Arensbergs began to look for a permanent home for their collection. In 1941, a group around actors Vincent Price, Edward G. Robinson, Fanny Brice, and Sam Jaffe tried to get the collection to stay on the West Coast, for the Modern Institute of Art in Beverly Hills.Oral history interview with Vincent Price, 1992 Aug. 6-14 Archives of American Art Oral History Program. In 1944, the Arensbergs signed a deed of gift with the University of California, Los Angeles, which included the stipulation that the University build an appropriate museum to house the collection in a specified time frame; their friend and fellow collector Galka Scheyer subsequently signed a similar agreement. By the fall of 1947 it was obvious that this condition would not be met and the contract was nullified. In 1939, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's board turned down a gift of avant-garde works from the collection.D.J. Waldie (September 18, 2011), L.A.'s postwar art scene: Hot rods and hedonism Los Angeles Times. The Arensbergs then began negotiations with numerous other institutions, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Denver Art Museum, Harvard University, the Honolulu Academy of Arts, the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (Mexico, D.F.), the National Gallery, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Art, Stanford University, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Minnesota. The Arensbergs eventually dropped their demand that the recipient of the collection also provide for the continuance of the Francis Bacon Foundation. After protracted discussions and many visits from Director Fiske Kimball and his wife Marie, the Arensbergs presented their collection of over 1000 objects, including correspondence, ephemera, clippings, writings, personal and art collection records, and photographs documenting the couple's art collecting activities as well as their friendship with many important artists, writers and scholars, to the Philadelphia Museum of Art on December 27, 1950. In 1949, Daniel Catton Rich and Katherine Kuh organized the first public exhibition of the Arensberg collection, held at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1949.Roberta Smith (January 12, 1994), Katherine Kuh, Art Connoisseur And Writer, 89 New York Times.

Mesonychids first appeared in the early Paleocene, went into a sharp decline at the end of the Eocene, and died out entirely when the last genus, Mongolestes, became extinct in the early Oligocene. In Asia, the record of their history suggests they grew gradually larger and more predatory over time, then shifted to scavenging and bone-crushing lifestyles before the group became extinct. Mesonychids probably originated in China, where the most primitive mesonychid, Yangtanglestes, is known from the early Paleocene. They were also most diverse in Asia, where they occur in all major Paleocene faunas. Since other predators, such as creodonts and Carnivora, were either rare or absent in these animal communities, mesonychids most likely dominated the large predator niche in the Paleocene of eastern Asia. One genus, Dissacus, had successfully spread to Europe and North America by the early Paleocene. Dissacus was a jackal-sized predator that has been found all over the Northern Hemisphere, but species of a closely related or identical genus, Ankalagon, from the early to middle Paleocene of New Mexico, were far larger, growing to the size of a bear. A later genus, Pachyaena, entered North America by the earliest Eocene, where it evolved into species that were at least as large. Mesonychids in North America were by far the largest predatory mammals during the early Paleocene to middle Eocene. Characteristics Mesonychids have often been reconstructed as resembling wolves, albeit superficially, but they would have appeared very different in life. With a short lower spine stiffened by revolute joints, they would have run with stiff backs like modern ungulates rather than bounding or loping with flexible spines like modern Carnivorans. While later mesonychids evolved a suite of limb adaptations for running similar to those in both wolves and deer, their legs remained comparatively thick. They would have resembled no group of living animals. Early mesonychids probably walked on the flats of their feet (plantigrade), while later ones walked on their toes (digitigrade). These later mesonychids had hooves, one on each toe, with four toes on each foot. The foot was compressed for efficient running with the axis between the third and fourth toes (paraxonic); it would have looked something like a hoofed paw. Mesonychids varied in size; some species were as small as a fox, others as large as a horse. Some members of the group are known only from skulls and jaws, or have fragmentary postcranial remains. But where skeletons are known, they indicate that mesonychids had large heads with strong jaw muscles, relatively long necks, and robust bodies with robust limbs that could run effectively but not rotate the hand or reach out to the side. An unrelated early group of mammalian predators, the creodonts, also had unusually large heads and limbs that traded flexibility for efficiency in running; large head size may be connected to inability to use the feet and claws to help catch and process food, as many modern carnivorans do. Some mesonychids are reconstructed as predatory (comparable to canids), others as scavengers or carnivore-scavengers with bone-crushing adaptations to their teeth (comparable to the large hyenas), and some as omnivorous (comparable to pigs, humans, or black bears). They may not have included hypercarnivores (comparable to felids); their teeth were not as effective at cutting meat as later groups of large mammalian predators. In some localities, multiple species or genera coexisted in different ecological niches. There is evidence to suggest that some genera were sexually dimorphic. Some genera may need revision to clarify the actual number of species or remove ambiguity about genera (such as Dissacus and Ankalagon). These \\"wolves on hooves\\" were probably one of the more important predator groups in the late Paleocene and Eocene ecosystems of Europe (which was an archipelago at the time), Asia (which was an island continent), and North America. Mesonychid dentition consisted of molars modified to generate vertical shear, thin blade- like lower molars, and carnassial notches, but no true carnassials. The molars were laterally compressed and often blunt, and were probably used for shearing meat or crushing bones. The largest species are considered to have been scavengers. Many species are suspected of being fish-eaters, though some of these reconstructions may be influenced by earlier theories that the group was ancestral to cetaceans. Phylogeny and evolutionary relationships Cladogram showing the position of the Mesonychia Mesonychians were long considered to be creodonts, but have now been removed from that order and placed in three families (Mesonychidae, Hapalodectidae, and Triisodontidae), either within their own order, Mesonychia, or within the order Condylarthra as part of the cohort or superorder Laurasiatheria. Nearly all mesonychids are, on average, larger than most of the Paleocene and Eocene creodonts and miacoid carnivorans. The order is sometimes referred to by its older name \\"Acreodi\\". Technically speaking, the term \\"mesonychid\\" refers specifically only to the members of the family Mesonychidae, such as the species of the genus Mesonyx. However, as the order is also renamed for Mesonyx, the term \\"mesonychid\\" is now used to refer to members of the entire order Mesonychia and the species of other families within it. A recent study found mesonychians to be basal euungulates most closely related to the \\"arctocyonids\\" Mimotricentes, Deuterogonodon and Chriacus. \\"Triisodontidae\\" may be paraphyletic.Sarah L. Shelley, Thomas E. Williamson, Stephen L. Brusatte, Resolving the higher-level phylogenetic relationships of “Triisodontidae” (‘Condylarthra’) within Placentalia, October 2015, Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (abstract) =Relationship with whales= Mesonychids possess unusual triangular molar teeth that are similar to those of Cetacea (whales and dolphins), especially those of the archaeocetes, as well as having similar skull anatomies and other morphologic traits. For this reason, scientists had long believed that mesonychids were the direct ancestor of Cetacea, but the discovery of well- preserved hind limbs of archaic cetaceans, as well as more recent phylogenetic analyses now indicate cetaceans are more closely related to hippopotamids and other artiodactyls than they are to mesonychids, and this result is consistent with many molecular studies. The similarity in dentition and skull may be the result of primitive ungulate structures in related groups independently evolving to meet similar needs as predators; some researchers have suggested that the absence of a first toe and a reduced metatarsal are basal features (synaptomorphies) indicating that mesonychids, perissodactyls, and artiodactyls are sister groups. Most paleontologists now doubt that whales are descended from mesonychids, and instead suggest mesonychians are descended from basal ungulates and cetaceans are descended from advanced ungulates (Artiodactyla), either deriving from, or sharing a common ancestor with, anthracotheres (the semiaquatic ancestors of hippos). However, the close grouping of whales with hippopotami in cladistic analyses only surfaces following the deletion of Andrewsarchus, which has often been included within the mesonychids. One possible conclusion is that Andrewsarchus has been incorrectly classified. The current uncertainty may, in part, reflect the fragmentary nature of the remains of some crucial fossil taxa, such as Andrewsarchus.

Created by writer Don McGregor and artist Paul Gulacy, it was published by Eclipse Enterprises, whose eventual division Eclipse Comics would publish a spin-off comic-book series. It was one of the first modern graphic novels and the first to be distributed in comic book shops. Publication history The initial project of Eclipse Enterprises, the graphic novel Sabre is a 38-page, black-and-white, science fiction swashbuckler in which the self-consciously romantic rebel Sabre and his companion Melissa Siren fight the mercenary Blackstar Blood and others to achieve freedom and strike a blow for individuality, all amid a futuristic Disneyland-turned-torture-chamber. It was published in August 1978 with no ISBN number.Sabre (Eclipse, 1978) at the Grand Comics Database The Eclipse graphic novel came 2 months after a try-out of the first 8 pages were featured in the June 1978 issue of Heavy Metal Magazine, Prologue One and Prologue Two featuring Sabre and Melissa Siren. This would mark the actual first appearance of both characters. As McGregor described the project's genesis in the afterword of the original edition, writer-editor Jim Salicrup, who in 1976 was toying with the idea of producing a weekly newspaper tabloid, asked McGregor to write a weekly adventure comic strip. McGregor had unsuccessfully pitched a feature called \\"Dagger\\" to Marvel Comics, for which he wrote features including \\"The Black Panther\\" and \\"Killraven, Warrior of the Worlds\\": He later wrote, \\"I think I took a token sum of money from Dean Mullaney ... of $300. I wanted Dean to be able to afford to do the book. He invested in the book for over a year. Everyone else was paid over their [usual] page rate.\\" Described on the credits page as a \\"comic novel\\" (the term \\"graphic novel\\" not being in common usage at the time), it was followed in 1982 by a 14-issue comic book series (cover-dated August 1982 – August 1985) by McGregor and, consecutively, the artists Billy Graham and José Ortiz. The first two issues reprinted the graphic novel in color.Sabre (Eclipse, 1982 series) at the Grand Comics Database According to McGregor, Eclipse co-founder Jan Mullaney strongly objected to some of the series' content, such as the graphic depiction of childbirth and the kiss between gay men, saying that it would cost them sales. Annette Kawecki was the letterer. P. Craig Russell inked \\"several\\" pages, Gulacy said in 1980.Gulacy in Interview conducted September 8, 1980. The first graphic novel to be sold in the new \\"direct market\\" of comic-book stores, Gough: \\"In 1978, Sabre was the first graphic novel to be sold in comic stores.\\" the book, priced at a then-considerable $6.00, helped prove the new format's viability by going into a second printing, dated February 1979. Publisher Dean Mullaney recalled in 2008, Eclipse published a 10th-anniversary edition of the original graphic novel (hardcover, ; trade paperback, ) with a new Gulacy cover and Jim Steranko logo. A 20th-anniversary edition was published by Image Comics in 1998,Sabre (Image Comics, 1998) and a 30th-anniversary edition by Desperado Publishing in 2008. Plot By February 2020, Earth has succumbed to global famine, energy crises, a plague based on a leaked American-government bioweapon, and, in the U.S., a nine-year drought and a variety of terrorist acts including the contamination of Manhattan's water supply. The U.S. government retreated to a fortress and commenced battling rebels through proxies known as Overseers. One rebel, Sabre, arrives at an abandoned theme park intending to free a group of captured comrades. With him is his lover and fellow rebel, Melissa Siren. As the local Overseer and technician Misty Visions follow their whereabouts, using security cameras that cover most but not every part of the park, Sabre and Melissa infiltrate the park's fantasyland castle and encounter animatronic mermaids and musicians while discussing the nature of men, women and the world that has been left to them. Hunting them are the mercenary Blackstar Blood, who sees Sabre as an honorable adversary, and the Overseer's troops – including the nervous, prattling Willoughby, and Grouse, an \\"ani-human construction\\" resembling a hybrid human and jungle cat. Sabre, fully aware the hostages serve as bait to trap him, nonetheless commandeers a replica of an old sailing ship as he searches for the captives. Blackstar and his crew ram it with one of their own, and capture the duo. Sabre is taken to a Synchronization Center, where, displayed before a gathering of scientists and officials, his memories are methodically wiped clean as he is forced to view Melissa, in a brothel suite, being groped and violated by Clarence, a sentient skeleton, and Grouse. She feigns submissiveness and steals Grouse's metal whip, swinging its bunched coils to tear apart Grouse's robotic head and whipping Clarence until he falls apart. Willoughby, who'd been repulsed by his comrades actions, unlocks her shackles. In the Synchronization Center, the Overseer frees a docile-seeming Sabre, who instantly fights back, having resisted the removal of his last few memories and pieces of identity. Escaping with a gun, he reaches the brothel suite but finds Melissa gone – and is told by the Overseer that she is dead. They prepare to duel, while elsewhere, Melissa and Willoughby bond as they about what brought him here. He tells her the Overseer is keeping the captive rebels in the castle's dungeon. As Blackstar and his men hunt Melissa, the dueling Sabre and Overseer fall from a building onto the monorail tracks just below. Technician Visions prepares to shoot Sabre, but Blackstar kills her out of disgust for the way Sabre and Melissa were tortured and wanting to best Sabre personally. As Sabre and the Overseer battle, and as Blackstar charges his horse toward them while a monorail bears down on all, Melissa and the freed rebels attack. Melissa takes a horse from one of Blackstar's men and rides onto the monorail track, chasing Blacksar. Sabre overpowers the Overseer, but when he sees Blackstar, Melissa and the monorail bearing down, loses his grip. Blackstar fires his weapon at the monorail, destroying it in a cataclysm that throws the combatants and horses from the track. Sabre shoots the Overseer dead. Blackstar, saying he is now unemployed, suggests that Sabre leave before more forces arrive to capture him. Two months later, a pregnant Melissa, knowing militias are hunting Sabre, orders him to leave without her. He does, vowing to return for her and their child.

History Bangarra Dance Theatre was founded in October 1989 by Carole J. Johnson, an African-American modern dancer and founder of the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Association (NAISDA), Rob Bryant, a Gumbaynggirr man and graduate of NAISDA, and Cheryl Stone, a South African- born student at NAISDA. Johnson toured Australia in 1972 with American choreographer Eleo Pomare and his company, and remained in Australia. In 1975 Johnson became the founding director of the Aboriginal Islander Skills Development Scheme, now known as the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Development Association (NAISDA). Johnson had a three-part plan for Aboriginal dance in Australia, including establishing a school to give academic qualifications and train dancers as members of a student and graduate performing company that would also teach. It would further provide a path for the dancers to other dance-related jobs, including choreography, tour management, and all front and back of house skills. Thirdly, a vital part was to maintain authentic cultural continuity, friendships, and close ties to traditional communities. Johnson mentored Stone, who studied alongside the dancers. She planned the formation of Bangarra and in 1989, became the founding Artistic Director of Bangarra Dance Theatre. Bangarra is the Wiradjuri word meaning \\"to make fire\\". Stephen Page has been the artistic director since 1991. Bangarra's first full-length show, Praying Mantis Dreaming, was produced in 1992, in 1994 Stephen Page with Bernadette Walong as Associate Director created Ochres and productions have followed annually since 2000. All have been successful within Australia and some have toured the United States and the United Kingdom. The group also made significant contributions to the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics. The company has received the Helpmann Award for Best Ballet or Dance Work multiple times. In 2019, the company marked their thirty-year anniversary with the launch of a digital archive and exhibition named Knowledge Ground.

It developed during the course of the twentieth-century from its origins in the casebook method of teaching law pioneered by Harvard legal scholar Christopher C. Langdell. In sharp contrast to many other teaching methods, the case method requires that instructors refrain from providing their own opinions about the decisions in question. Rather, the chief task of instructors who use the case method is asking students to devise, describe, and defend solutions to the problems presented by each case.  Comparison with the casebook method of teaching law  The case method evolved from the casebook method, a mode of teaching based on Socratic principles pioneered at Harvard Law School by Christopher C. Langdell. Like the casebook method the case method calls upon students to take on the role of an actual person faced with a difficult problem.  Decision-forcing cases  A decision-forcing case is a kind of decision game. Like any other kinds of decision games, a decision-forcing case puts students in a role of person faced with a problem (often called the \\"protagonist\\") and asks them to devise, defend, discuss, and refine solutions to that problem. However, in sharp contrast to decision games that contain fictional elements, decision-forcing cases are based entirely upon reliable descriptions of real events. A decision-forcing case is also a kind of case study. That is, it is an examination of an incident that took place at some time in the past. However, in contrast to a retrospective case study, which provides a complete description of the events in question, a decision-forcing case is based upon an \\"interrupted narrative.\\" This is an account that stops whenever the protagonist finds himself faced with an important decision. In other words, while retrospective case studies ask students to analyze past decisions with the aid of hindsight, decision-forcing cases ask students to engage problems prospectively.  Criticisms of decision-forcing cases  In recent years, following corporate scandals and the global financial crisis, the case method has been criticized for contributing to a narrow, instrumental, amoral, managerial perspective on business where making decisions which maximise profit is all that matters, ignoring the social responsibilities of organisations. It is argued that the case method puts too much emphasis on taking action and not enough on thoughtful reflection to see things from different perspectives. It has been suggested that different approaches to case writing, that do not put students in the ‘shoes’ of a manager, be encouraged to address these concerns.  Role play  Every decision-forcing case has a protagonist, the historical person who was faced with the problem or problem that students are asked to solve. Thus, in engaging these problems, students necessarily engage in some degree of role play. Some case teachers, such as those of the Marine Corps University, place a great deal of emphasis on role play, to the point of addressing each student with the name and titles of the protagonist of the case. (A student playing the role of a king, for example, is asked \\"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\\") Other case teachers, such as those at the Harvard Business School, place less emphasis on role play, asking students \\"what would you do if you were the protagonist of the case.\\"  Historical solution  After discussing student solutions to the problem at the heart of a decision-forcing case, a case teacher will often provide a description of the historical solution, that is, the decision made by the protagonist of the case. Also known as \\"the rest of the story\\", \\"the epilogue\\", or (particularly at Harvard University) \\"the 'B' case\\", the description of the historical solution can take the form of a printed article, a video, a slide presentation, a short lecture, or even an appearance by the protagonist. Whatever the form of the description of the historical solution, the case teacher must take care to avoid giving the impression that the historical solution is the \\"right answer.\\" Rather, he should point out that the historical solution to the problem serves primarily to provide students with a baseline to which they can compare their own solutions. Some case teachers will refrain from providing the historical solution to students. One reason for not providing the historical solution is to encourage students to do their own research about the outcome of the case. Another is to encourage students to think about the decision after the end of the class discussion. \\"Analytic and problem-solving learning,\\" writes Kirsten Lundgren of Columbia University, \\"can be all the more powerful when the 'what happened' is left unanswered.  Complex cases  A classic decision-forcing case asks students to solve a single problem faced by a single protagonist at a particular time. There are, however, decision-forcing cases in which students play the role of a single protagonist who is faced with a series of problems, two or more protagonists dealing with the same problem, or two or more protagonists dealing with two or more related problems.  Decision-forcing staff rides  A decision-forcing case conducted in the place where the historical decisions at the heart of the case were made is called a \\"decision-forcing staff ride.\\" Also known as an \\"on-site decision-forcing case\\", a decision-forcing staff ride should not be confused with the two very different exercises that are also known as \\"staff rides\\": retrospective battlefield tours of the type practiced by the United States Army in the twentieth century and the on-site contingency planning exercises (Stabs Reisen, literally \\"staff journeys\\") introduced by Gerhard von Scharnhorst in 1801 and made famous by the elder Hellmuth von Moltke in the middle years of the nineteenth century. To avoid confusion between \\"decision-forcing staff rides\\" and staff rides of other sorts, the Case Method Project at the Marine Corps University in Quantico, Virginia, adopted the term \\"Russell Ride\\" to describe the decision-forcing staff rides that it conducts. The term is an homage to Major General John Henry Russell Jr.,USMC, the 16th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps and an avid supporter of the applicatory method of instruction.  Sandwich metaphors  Decision-forcing cases are sometimes described with a system of metaphors that compares them to various types of sandwiches. In this system, pieces of bread serve as a metaphor for narrative elements (i.e. the start, continuation, or end of an account) and filling of the sandwich serves as a metaphor for a problem that students are asked to solve. A decision-forcing case in which one protagonist is faced with two problems is thus a \\"triple- decker case.\\" (The bottom piece of bread is the background to the first problem, the second piece of bread is both the historical solution to the first problem and the background to the second problem, and the third piece of bread is the historical solution to the second problem.) Similarly, a decision-forcing case for which the historical solution is not provided (and is thus a case with but one narrative element) is an \\"open-face\\" or \\"smørrebrød\\" case. A decision-forcing case in which students are asked to play the role of a decision-maker who is faced with a series of decisions in a relatively short period of time is sometimes called a \\"White Castle\\", \\"slider\\" case. or \\"day in the life\\" case.  Case materials  Case materials are any materials that are used to inform the decisions made by students in the course of a decision-forcing case. Commonly used case materials include articles that were composed for the explicit purpose of informing case discussion, secondary works initially produced for other purposes, historical documents, artifacts, video programs, and audio programs. Case materials are made available to students at a variety times in the course of a decision-forcing case. Materials that provide background are distributed at, or before, the beginning of the class meeting. Materials that describe the solution arrived at by the protagonist and the results of that solution are passed out at, or after, the end of the class meeting. (These are called \\"the B-case\\", \\"the rest of the story\\", or \\"the reveal.\\") Materials that provide information that became available to the protagonist in the course of solving the problem are given to students in the course of a class meeting. (These are often referred to as \\"handouts.\\") Case materials may be either \\"refined\\" or \\"raw.\\" Refined case materials are secondary works that were composed expressly for use as part of decision-forcing cases. (Most of the case materials that are available from case clearing houses and academic publishers are of the refined variety.) Raw case materials are those that were initially produced for reasons other than the informing of a case discussion. These include newspaper articles, video and audio news reports, historical documents, memoirs, interviews, and artifacts.  Published case materials  A number of organizations, to include case clearing houses, academic publishers, and professional schools, publish case materials. These organizations include: * Harvard Business School * Stanford Graduate School of Business *INSEAD *ICFAI Business School Hyderabad * Ivey Business School https://www.iveycases.com/Default.aspx * Indian School of Business https://www.isb.edu/sritne/research/case-studies * Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad * Darden School at the University of Virginia * Nagoya University of Commerce & Business * Asian Institute of Management * Asian Case Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong * Globalens at the University of Michigan The Case Centre The Case Centre (formerly the European Case Clearing House), headquartered in Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedford, United Kingdom, and with its US office at Babson College, Wellesley, Massachusetts, is the independent home of the case method. It is a membership-based organization with more than 500 members worldwide, not-for-profit organisation and registered charity founded in 1973. The Case Centre is the world’s largest and most diverse repository of case studies used in Management Education, with cases from the world’s top case publishing schools, including, Harvard Business School, ICFAI Business School Hyderabad, INSEAD, IMD, Ivey Business School, Darden School of Business, London Business School, etc. Its stated aim is to promote the case method by sharing knowledge, skills, and expertise in this area among teachers and students, and for this it engages in various activities like conducting case method workshops, offering case scholarships, publishing a journal, and organizing a global case method awards. The Case Centre Awards (known as the European Awards from 1991 and 2010) recognises outstanding case writers and teachers worldwide. These prestigious awards, popularly known as the case method community's annual 'Oscars', or the “business education Oscars, celebrate worldwide excellence in case writing and teaching. The narrative fallacy The presentation of a decision-forcing case necessarily takes the form of a story in which the protagonist is faced with a difficult problem. This can lead to \\"the narrative fallacy\\", a mistake that leads both case teachers and the developers of case materials to ignore information that, while important to the decision that students will be asked to make, complicates the telling of the story. This, in turn, can create a situation in which, rather than engaging the problem at the heart of the case, students \\"parse the case materials.\\" That is, they make decisions on the basis of the literary structure of the case materials rather than the underlying reality. Techniques for avoiding the narrative fallacy include the avoidance of standard formats for case materials; awareness of tropes and clichés; the use of case materials originally created for purposes other than case teaching; and the deliberate inclusion of \\"distractors\\" - information that is misleading, irrelevant, or at odds with other information presented in the case. Purpose of the case method The case method gives students the ability to quickly make sense of a complex problem, rapidly arrive at a reasonable solution, and communicate that solution to others in a succinct and effective manner. In the course of doing this, the case method also accomplishes a number of other things, each of which is valuable in its own right. By exciting the interest of students, the case method fosters interest in professional matters. By placing such things in a lively context, the case method facilitates the learning of facts, nomenclature, conventions, techniques, and procedures. By providing both a forum for discussion and concrete topics to discuss, the case method encourages professional dialogue. By providing challenging practice in the art of decision-making, the case method refines professional judgement. By asking difficult questions, the case method empowers students to reflect upon the peculiar demands of their profession. In his classic essay on the case method (\\"Because Wisdom Can't Be Told\\"), Charles I. Gragg of the Harvard Business School argued that \\"the case system, properly used, initiates students into the ways of independent thought and responsible judgement.\\" Incompatible objectives While the case method can be used to accomplish a wide variety of goals, certain objectives are at odds with its nature as an exercise in professional judgement. These incompatible objectives include attempts to use decision-forcing cases to: * provide an example to be emulated * paint a particular person as a hero or a villain * encourage (or discourage) a particular type of behavior * illustrate a pre-existing theory Thomas W. Shreeve, who uses the case method to teach people in the field of military intelligence, argues that \\"Cases are not meant to illustrate either the effective or the ineffective handling of administrative, operational, logistic, ethical, or other problems, and the characters in cases should not be portrayed either as paragons of virtue or as archvillains. The instructor/casewriter must be careful not to tell the students what to think—they are not empty vessels waiting to be filled with wisdom. With this method of teaching, a major share of the responsibility for thinking critically about the issues under discussion is shifted to the students, where it belongs.\\" Disclaimers Case materials are often emblazoned with a disclaimer that warns both teachers and students to avoid the didactic, hortatory, and \\"best practices\\" fallacies. Here are some examples of such disclaimers: This case is intended to serve as the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either the effective or ineffective handling of a situation. This decision-forcing case is an exercise designed to foster empathy, creativity, a bias for action, and other martial virtues. As such, it makes no argument for the effectiveness of any particular course of action, technique, procedure, or convention. *The Acton School of Business *Asian Institute of Management * Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad * Richard Ivey School of Business * John F.

It is often known locally as \\"Bovey\\". It is about 10 miles south-west of Exeter and lies on the A382 road, about halfway between Newton Abbot and Moretonhampstead. The village is at the centre of the electoral ward of Bovey. At the 2011 census the population of this ward was 7,721. History Bovey Tracey was an established Saxon community and takes its name from the River Bovey. The name first appears in Domesday Book as Bovi and possibly earlier as Buui. The town gained its second name from the de Tracey family who were lords of the manor after the Norman Conquest, and was first documented as Bovitracy in 1309. One member of the family, William de Tracy, was implicated in the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170. It is thought that he rebuilt the parish church of St Peter, St Paul and St Thomas of Canterbury as penance for the murder. In the early 13th century Henry de Tracey created a borough here and in 1259 was granted the right to hold a weekly market and an annual three-day fair. During the English Civil War on 9 January 1646, Oliver Cromwell and a contingent of his Roundhead army entered Bovey Tracey after dark and caught part of Lord Wentworth's Regiment by surprise, catching a number of officers playing cards in an inn. Many of Wentworth's Royalist troops escaped, but Cromwell did capture about 400 horse. If local legend is to be believed, the Royalists escaped by throwing coins from the windows in order to distract the poorly paid Roundhead troops. The next day a battle was fought on nearby Bovey Heath ending in victory for Cromwell's army. The name of Cromwell lives on in the town today in both the public house \\"The Cromwell Arms\\" and the remains of a nearby stone arch, known locally (and incorrectly) as \\"Cromwell's Arch\\". The arch is actually what is left of a priory that stood previously on the site of the nearby Baptist Church. The Bovey Tracey Potteries operated from the 1750s for about 200 years. Bovey railway station was opened on 26 June 1866 with the new Moretonhampstead and South Devon Railway on a site to the west of the town. It closed to passengers on 28 February 1959, but goods trains continued to operate until 6 July 1970. Bovey Tracey was twinned with Le Molay-Littry in Normandy, however in February 2018 local Councillors surprisingly discovered that the French town had unexpectedly twinned with another location, Theydon Bois in Essex. Geography Bovey Tracey lies in the valley of the River Bovey at the junction of the A382 road (between Newton Abbot and Moretonhampstead) and the B3387 road (Chudleigh Knighton to Haytor Vale). =Climate= Since 1990, the highest recorded temperature was 27 °C (81 °F) in July 2018 and the lowest was -5 °C (23 °F) in February 1991 and March 2018. Notable features Church of St Peter, St Paul and St Thomas of Canterbury Original paintings of apostles and prophets on the wainscot of the rood screen, restored by Anna Hulbert, dated to the early 16th century The town has over a hundred listed buildings. The parish church, at the top of the town, is grade I listed. It has a tower dating from the 14th century, many 15th-century carvings including three misericords, and a screen described by Arthur Mee as \\"one of the finest in this county of fine screens\\".Mee, A. The King's England:Devon (Hodder and Stoughton, 1965), p.47. The screen was restored in 1887 with the central panels the work of Charles Edgar Buckeridge. The church has an unbroken list of vicars from 1258. On Hind Street, the East Dartmoor Baptist Church was built in 1824 and is now grade II listed. Original support for the church came mainly from workers in the Bovey Potteries. Since 1986, the Devon Guild of Craftsmen contemporary crafts gallery has occupied a building known as Riverside Mill, on the bank of the River Bovey. The building, dating from 1854, has an undershot waterwheel that was used to pump water up to a tank in its tower. The stored water was used as the supply for a nearby house owned by John Divett and to water its stable yard and gardens. Nearby, the Bovey Tracey Heritage Centre in the old Bovey railway station is run by volunteers and is open in the summer months. On the outskirts of the town are the House of Marbles, a visitor attraction on the site of the historic pottery; and the headquarters of the Dartmoor National Park Authority at Parke, a large house which is leased to the authority by the National Trust. Also nearby are a Devon Wildlife Trust nature reserve at Bovey Heath and the Haytor Granite Tramway, the route of which runs through the parish, west of the town. According to the town council the town has a \\"good mixture of shops\\" and there is a farmers' market on alternate Saturday mornings. The town also hosts multiple events throughout the year for both tourists and the local community, including: 'Nourish', a food and gin festival held in September; and the 'Contemporary Craft Festival', held in June. Historic estates Within the parish of Bovey Tracey are various historic estates, including: *Indio, long a seat of the Southcott family,Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004; Vivian, Lt.Col.

His widow married Elize Hele, whose monument and effigy faces that of Eveleigh. There are several inscribed tablets to later owners in Bovey Tracey Church. Now the headquarters of the Dartmoor National Park Authority. Sport Bovey Tracey is the start point of the Dartmoor Devil bicycle ride, an annual Audax UK Brevet Populaire event held in late October that takes in over 2,000 m of climbing and over 100 km around and across Dartmoor. The ride ends in nearby Manaton. The town has a Non-League football club Bovey Tracey A.F.C. who play at The Western Counties Roofing Ground in the South West Peninsula League.

W. Rouse Ball (1960) Calculating Prodigies, in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, chapter 13. He attended schools in Hamburg from a very early age, but later admitted that his instruction had little influence on him. He used to spend a lot of time playing dominoes, and suggested that this played a significant role in developing his calculating skills. Dase suffered from epilepsy from early childhood throughout his life. At age 15 he began to travel extensively, giving exhibitions in Germany, Austria and England. Among his most impressive feats, he multiplied 79532853 × 93758479 in 54 seconds. He multiplied two 20-digit numbers in 6 minutes; two 40-digit numbers in 40 minutes; and two 100-digit numbers in 8 hours 45 minutes. The famous mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss commented that someone skilled in calculation could have done the 100-digit calculation in about half that time with pencil and paper. These exhibitions however did not earn him enough money, so he tried to find other employments. In 1844 he obtained a position in the Railway Department of Vienna, but this didn't last long since in 1845 he was reported in Mannheim and in 1846 in Berlin. In 1844, Dase calculated π to 200 decimal places over the course of approximately two months, a record for the time, from the Machin-like formula: :\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} = \\\\arctan \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\arctan \\\\frac{1}{5} + \\\\arctan \\\\frac{1}{8}. He also calculated a 7-digit logarithm table and extended a table of integer factorizations from 6,000,000 to 9,000,000. Dase had very little knowledge of mathematical theory. The mathematician Julius Petersen tried to teach him some of Euclid's theorems, but gave up the task once he realized that their comprehension was beyond Dase's capabilities. Preston, Richard, 2008, Panic in Level 4, p. 32. Gauss however was very impressed with his calculating skill, and he recommended that the Hamburg Academy of Sciences should allow Dase to do mathematical work on a full-time basis, but Dase died shortly thereafter. The book \\"Gödel, Escher, Bach\\" by Douglas Hofstadter mentions his calculating abilities. \\"... he also had an uncanny sense of quantity. That is, he could just 'tell', without counting, how many sheep were in a field, or words in a sentence, and so forth, up to about 30.\\" ReferencesExternal links * – A biography of Zacharias Dase.

Early life Don McGregor was born in Providence, Rhode Island where he worked myriad jobs as a young adult, including as a security guard, at a bank, at a movie theater, and \\"for my grandfather's company, [which] printed, among other things, the patches the astronauts wore on their flights to the moon.\\" He additionally served as a supply sergeant in a military police unit of the Rhode Island Army National Guard.McGregor, Don. \\"Roy Thomas Hired Me to Work on Staff at Marvel\\", DonMcGregor.com, 13 March 2013.

Per source, comics in which his letters appear include Fantastic Four #33 (cover-dated Dec. 1964), #48 (March 1966), #74 (May 1968), #80 (Nov. 1968), #86 (May 1969), and #91 (Oct. 1969); and The Amazing Spider- Man #77 (Oct. 1969) and for The Providence Journal, where his work included reviews of books by authors including Evan Hunter, \\"who influenced me greatly as a writer.\\" Career McGregor entered the comics industry with stories in Warren Publishing's black-and-white horror-comics anthology magazines. His first purchased script \\"When Wakes The Dreamer\\" did not see print until Eerie #45 (Feb. 1973), long after his first published script, the 12-page cover story \\"The Fade-Away Walk\\" in Creepy #40 (July 1971), credited as Donald F. McGregor, with art by Tom Sutton.Donald F. McGregor at the Grand Comics Database Through 1975, he wrote more than a dozen stories for those magazines and its sister title Vampirella, drawn by artists including Richard Corben and Reed Crandall. Of \\"When Wakes the Dreamer\\", he explained decades later, \\"[W]hat held it up was that [artist and Warren art director] Billy Graham was going to draw it and he'd done a spectacular opening page for it, but for one reason or another, it just didn't happen. ... I don't think we ever found the finished art for Billy's version of another early story of mine, 'The Vampiress Stalks the Castle This Night.'\\". That story eventually appeared in Vampirella #21 (Dec. 1972), with art by Felix Mas. After a stint with Marvel, McGregor returned to write another 18 stories for those Warren titles as well as The Rook between 1979 and 1983, with artists including Paul Gulacy, Alfredo Alcala, and Val Mayerik. =Marvel Comics= McGregor became a proofreader for Marvel Comics in late 1972,Bullpen Bulletins: \\"Four or Five Phenomenal Flashes, Fitfully Fashioned to Fight Lethargy (Or: Those Wedding Bells are Waking Up that Old Gang of Mine)\\", in Marvel Comics cover-dated March 1973, including Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #108. earning $125 a week, before establishing himself as a Marvel editor and writer. His first stories for the company were co-writing, with Gardner Fox, the six-page supernatural story \\"The Man with Two Faces\\" in Journey into Mystery vol. 2, #4 (April 1973; credited as \\"Donald F. McGregor\\"); and, solo, the six-page \\"A Tomb By Any Other Name\\", with art by Syd Shores, in Chamber of Chills #5 (July 1973). He recalled in 2010, With those two features, which became among comics' most acclaimed,In addition to contemporaneous reviews in the 1970s, latter-day reviews include: *Gage, Chris: \\"Don McGregor took over the 'Killraven' writing chores, and was joined soon after by P. Craig Russell. With their combined talents, and the freedom that comes with working on a low-selling book that could be cancelled at any moment, the two of them produced a groundbreaking series that explored philosophy, madness, love, violence, and the nature of freedom\\". — *Sangiacomo, Michael: \\"Though quite a few folks had their hand in the original run back in Amazing Adventures, it was the words-and-pictures team of Don McGregor and P. Craig Russell that made my tentacles twitch. ... a classic\\". — *Vance, Michael: \\"As his work progressed, readers saw P. Craig Russell take artistic ownership of 'Killraven'. ... Much like Jim Steranko's work on Marvel's Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D, events flowed through some pages in a style that was as reminiscent of fine art as it was of comic art. Also impressive was his sense of design. Russell arguably produced some of the most imaginative, and visually horrific, monsters and villains in Marvel's history. Don McGregor handled the writing for this issue-run, and credit must be given to his involved plots, as well as his ability to pack a lot of story into a 32-page pamphlet\\". — McGregor soon established himself as one of a 1970s wave of Marvel writers, including Steve Englehart, Steve Gerber and Doug Moench, who took often minor characters and helped create a writerly Renaissance. Former Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas said in 2007, McGregor wrote \\"Killraven, Warrior of the Worlds\\" in Amazing Adventures vol. 2, #21-39 (Nov. 1973 - Nov. 1976, except for fill-in issues #33 and 38); and \\"Black Panther\\" in Jungle Action #6-24 (Sept. 1973 - Nov. 1976, except for #23, a reprint).Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 160: \\"Marvel assigned Don McGregor, a uniquely talented writer, to write this series. McGregor's initial idea for this Black Panther series was an ambitious thirteen-part storyline.\\" Comics historian Les Daniels noted that, \\"The scripts by Don McGregor emphasized the character's innate dignity.\\" Unusually for mainstream comics, the Panther stories were set mostly in Africa, in the Panther's fictional homeland Wakanda rather than in Marvel's usual American settings. As with the futuristic stories of “Killraven”, McGregor's settings were enough outside the Marvel mainstream that he was able to explore mature themes and adult relationships in a way rare for comics at the time. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked McGregor's run on Jungle Action third on its list of the \\"Top 10 1970s Marvels\\". Artist Rich Buckler, his first \\"Black Panther\\" collaborator, called McGregor and fellow Marvel writer Doug Moench \\"two of my absolutely favorite writers. They had the same drive and enthusiasm, and just huge amounts of talent and energy.\\" . African-American writer-editor Dwayne McDuffie said of the 1970s \\"Black Panther\\" series: He and artist P. Craig Russell engineered color comic books' first known dramatic interracial kiss in mainstream comics (as opposed to underground comix), between the \\"Killraven\\" characters M'Shulla and Carmilla Frost, in Amazing Adventures #31 (July 1975). Three years earlier, McGregor and artist Luis Garcia had already presented the first known interracial kiss in any comics in Warren Publishing's black-and-white horror- comics magazine, Creepy #43 (Jan. 1972), in the story \\"The Men Who Called Him Monster\\". More than two decades after the \\"Killraven\\" feature ended, comics historian Peter Sanderson wrote that, McGregor's run on Jungle Action ended when the series was canceled due to low sales. He also wrote stories for the Marvel characters Luke Cage and Morbius the Living Vampire, and created the detective feature \\"Hodiah Twist\\", seen in the black-and-white magazines Vampire Tales #2 (Oct. 1973) and Marvel Preview #16: \\"Masters of Terror\\" (Fall 1978).Nevins, Jess. \\"Hodiah Twist\\" at A Guide to Marvel's Pre-FF #1 Heroes. McGregor wrote an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" as a backup story in Marvel Classics Comics #28 (1977). This would be Michael Golden's first published comics work. A Marvel \\"Bullpen Bulletins\\" page in 1975 announced McGregor's planned radio drama series, Night Figure, that was to have run on WHBI-FM.Bullpen Bulletins: \\"A Gargantuan Gallery of Garulous [sic] Goings-On Guaranteed to Garner Your Gratitude!\\", in Marvel Comics cover- dated November 1975, including Fantastic Four #164. =Graphic novel pioneer= Sabre (1978). Cover art by Paul Gulacy. One of the first modern graphic novels, and the first sold through the then-emerging \\"direct market\\" of comic-book stores. With artist Paul Gulacy, McGregor created one of the first modern graphic novels, Eclipse Enterprises' Sabre: Slow Fade of an Endangered Species, a near-future, dystopian science fiction swashbuckler that introduced the title character. McGregor's work premiered in August 1978, two months before Will Eisner's better-known graphic novel A Contract with God. Sabre was additionally the first graphic novel sold through the new \\"direct market\\" of comic-book stores. Gough: \\"In 1978, Sabre was the first graphic novel to be sold in comic stores.\\" It later spun off a 14-issue Eclipse comic- book series.Sabre (Eclipse, 1982 series) at the Grand Comics Database Also for Eclipse, McGregor wrote Detectives Inc., a pair of graphic novels set in contemporary New York City and starring the interracial private eye team Ted Denning and Bob Rainier. Detectives Inc.: A Remembrance of Threatening Green (1980), with DC Comics artist Marshall Rogers, and Detectives, Inc.: A Terror Of Dying Dreams, with veteran Marvel artist Gene Colan, who would become a frequent collaborator, comprised the series. The first of these two books included the first lesbian characters in mass-market comics. During this period, McGregor also wrote the two prose works Dragonflame and Other Bedtime Nightmares and The Variable Syndrome. =Later comics= Other work includes the DC Comics' miniseries Nathaniel Dusk (1984) and Nathaniel Dusk II (1985–1986), both with Colan; and, for New Media Publishing's Fantasy Illustrated (1982), \\"The Hounds of Hell Theory\\", starring the husband-and-wife detective team Alexander and Penelope Risk, with artist Tom Sutton. McGregor revisited the Black Panther with Colan in \\"Panther's Quest\\", published as 25 eight-page installments within the biweekly omnibus series Marvel Comics Presents (issues #13–37, Feb.–Dec. 1989); and, later, with artist Dwayne Turner in the squarebound miniseries Panther's Prey (May–Oct. 1991). McGregor and Marshall Rogers crafted a two-part story in Spider-Man issues #27–28 dealing with bullying and gun violence. Other comic book work in the 1990s includes Blade #1–3 (Nov. 1998–Jan. 1999), starring the Marvel Comics vampire- slayer; the 14-page Morbius, the Living Vampire story \\"Desiring Martine\\", with artist Mike Dringenberg, in the Marvel one-shot Strange Tales: Dark Corners #1 (May 1998); and various issues of such Topps Comics licensed properties as Mars Attacks!, James Bond, the Lone Ranger, and The X-Files. McGregor wrote \\"Thin Edge of a Dime\\", a Batman Black and White backup story, in Batman: Gotham Knights #28 (June 2002) which was illustrated by Dick Giordano. As well, McGregor is one of the primary writers of the Zorro canon, with a dozen issues of Topps' Zorro (#0–11, Nov. 1993–Nov. 1994) and the spinoff Lady Rawhide #1–5 (Oct. 1996–June 1997; reprinted by Image Comics as Zorro's Lady Rawhide: Other People's Blood #1–4, March–June 1999); two years of the Zorro newspaper comic strip (with artists Tod Smith and Thomas Yeates, premiering April 12, 1999, with the first year collected in a 2001 Image Comics book); Zorro #1–6 (May-Oct. 2005), with artist Sidney Lima, from the NBM Publishing imprint Papercutz; and 2010's Zorro: Matanzas, a sequel to the Topps series, with penciler Mike Mayhew, for Dynamite Entertainment. McGregor contributed a story to the Black Panther Annual #1, released in February 2018.

(2005). \\"Dōkyō\\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 158. Early life Dōkyō was born in Kawachi ProvinceMulhern, Chieko Irie. (1991). Heroic With Grace: Legendary Women of Japan,p. 73.. His family, the Yuge no Muraji, were part of the provincial gentry. He was taught both by a Confucian teacher and by the Abbot Gien of the Eihei-ji. Under Gien he learned Sanskrit. Subsequently, Dōkyō lived as an ascetic for several years in the Kongō Range on Honshu, where he practiced meditation and sutras; both of these practices were concerned with the acquisition of magical powers. In 748 he is recorded as being at the Todai-ji under Rōben, and in 749 he participated in a sutra copying ceremony in Nara, and was called to the Kōken's court three years later.Shively, Donald H. and William H. McCullough. (1999). The Cambridge History of Japan, p. 453. Rise to Power When Dōkyō cured the illness of Kōken in 761, after she had abdicated in 758, he attained a secure and influential place in her court; she initially regarded him as her healer and spiritual adviser, before turning to him for political advice as well. According to some accounts, he also became her lover. When Junnin attempted to remonstrate with her over this latter issue, she rebuffed him and granted Dōkyō greater powers and authority. She appointed him shōsōzu in 763, an important position in the Buddhist hierarchy. Fujiwara no Nakamaro, a favourite of the Emperor Junnin, was angered by this decision, but failed in his attempt to oppose Dōkyō - he was exiled. When Kōken returned to the throne as Empress Shōtoku following Fujiwara no Nakamaro's unsuccessful rebellion, Dōkyō was made daijō-daijin within a year, giving him authority over both civil and religious affairs. In 766, he was granted a new position, hō-ō; in 767 this position was altered to include military authority. The next year, in 768, Dōkyō persuaded an oracle from the Usa Shrine in Buzen Province to predict peace in Japan if Dōkyō were named emperor. This angered the ruling class, including the powerful Fujiwara clan. Hence, a second oracle was brought to Kyoto by Wake no Kiyomaro.Bender, Ross. \\"The Hachiman Cult and the Dōkyō Incident\\", Monumenta Nipponica, Vol. 34, Issue 2, p. 125; retrieved 2013-1-9. It stated: > Since the establishment of our state, the distinction between lord and > subject has been fixed. Never has there been an occasion when a subject was > made lord. The throne of the Heavenly Sun Succession shall be given to one > of the imperial lineage; wicked persons should immediately be swept away. In response to the second oracle, Dōkyō had Wake no Kiyomaro sent into exile in Ōsumi Province.Nussbaum, \\"Wake no Kiyomaro\\" at p. 1026. Policies during Ascendancy During this period, the height of his political power and influence, Dōkyō built a temple in Yao, Osaka. It was sponsored by Shōtoku. Its foundations were discovered by archaeologists in 2017. Additionally, existing temples received extravagant donations and ongoing building projects were accelerated and expanded. The Usa Shrine also received grants of land. Dōkyō also actively spread Buddhist principles and the religion itself. Laws were issued banning the raising of dogs and hawks for hunting, and meat and fish were disallowed from presentation to the emperor's table. Moreover, the power of the great clans, such as the Fujiwara, was reduced and limited during this period. Fall from Power and Death When the empress died in 770, Dōkyō was stripped of his titles and banished from Nara, sent to Shimotsuke Province; the Fujiwara clan reasserted its authority over both the monastic institutions and the broader political landscape.

Rapakivi granite is a hornblende- biotite granite containing large round crystals of orthoclase each with a rim of oligoclase (a variety of plagioclase). The name has come to be used most frequently as a textural term where it implies plagioclase rims around orthoclase in plutonic rocks. Rapakivi is Finnish for \\"crumbly rock\\", because the different heat expansion coefficients of the component minerals make exposed rapakivi crumbly.Tietoaineistot - maaperäkartan käyttöopas - rapautuminen - GTK Rapakivi was first described by Finnish petrologist Jakob Sederholm in 1891.\\"Ueber die finnländischen Rapakiwigesteine Since then, southern Finland's rapakivi granite intrusions have been the type locality of this variety of granite.\\"3000 miljoonaa vuotta, Suomen Kallioperä\\" Finnish geological society, 1998, chapter 9, . Language: Finnish. Occurrence Eroded rapakivi granite in Finland Rapakivi is a fairly uncommon type of granite, but has been described from localities in North and South America (Illescas Batholith, Uruguay, Rondônia, Brazil) parts of the Baltic Shield, southern Greenland, southern Africa, India and China. Most of these examples are found within Proterozoic metamorphic belts, although both Archaean and Phanerozoic examples are known. Formation Rapakivi granites have formation ages from Archean to recent and are usually attributed to anorogenic tectonic settings. They have formed in shallow (a few km deep) sills of up to 10 km thickness. Rapakivi granites are often found associated with intrusions of anorthosite, norite, charnockite and mangerite. It has been suggested that the entire suite results from the fractional crystallization of a single parental magma.Zhang, S-H., Liu, S-W., Zhao, Y., Yang, J-H. Song, B. and Liu, X-M.

Geochemistry  Rapakivi is enriched in K, Rb, Pb, Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Zn, Ga, Sn, Th, U, F and rare earth elements, and poor in Ca, Mg, Al, P and Sr. Fe/Mg, K/Na and Rb/Sr ratios are high. SiO2 content is 70.5%, which makes rapakivi an acidic granite.Rämö, T., Haapala, I. ja Laitakari, I. 1998. Rapakivigraniitit – peruskallio repeää ja sen juuret sulavat.

Rapakivi is high in fluoride, ranging 0.04–1.53%, compared to other similar rocks at around 0.35%. Consequently, groundwater in rapakivi zones is high in fluoride (1–2 mg/l), making the water naturally fluoridated. Some water companies actually have to remove fluoride from the water. The uranium content of rapakivi is fairly high, up to 24 ppm. Thus, in rapakivi zones, the hazard from radon, a decay product of uranium, is elevated. Some indoor spaces surpass the 400 Bq/m3 safety limit.Valmari, T., Arvela, H., ja Reisbacka, H. 2012. Radon in Finnish apartment buildings.

Meeker Island was named after its owner Judge Bradley B. Meeker. Meeker County was named after him also. After a construction period lasting eight years, the site was only in operation for five years from 1907 to 1912 when the growing interest in hydroelectric power led to design and construction of today's Lock and Dam No. 1 a few miles downriver. It was realized that the new dam could take over the function provided by this first site and another small dam a short distance downriver. Lock and Dam No. 1 opened in 1917, and a hydroelectric plant was added there in the 1920s to power the Ford Motor Company's Twin Cities Assembly Plant. The Meeker Island dam was demolished, although some ruins of the lock remain. Tops of the old lock walls become visible during low water periods on the river. It is located in the Desnoyer Park neighborhood, north of the Lake Street-Marshall Bridge connecting Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota. The Meeker Island Lock and Dam ruins were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Each year, National Park Service historian Dr. John Anfinson and the Friends of the Mississippi River lead a tour of the lock and dam ruins.

Plan of the church of St. Mary. Kingsclere can trace back its history to a place identified as belonging to King Alfred in his will between 872 and 888, the 'clere' possibly meaning 'bright' or 'clearing'. Kingsclere formed part of the ancient demesne of the Crown. In his will King Alfred left Kingsclere for life to his second daughter, Ethelgiva, Abbess of Shaftesbury,Walter de Gray Birch, Cartularium saxonicum: a collection of charters relating to Anglo-Saxon history 1883-1893: ii, 178, 182. and there are other mentions of it in Saxon charters. In 931 King Athelstan at a Witenagemot at Colchester granted 10 hides of land at Clere to Abbot Aelfric,Birch, Cart. Sax. ii, 357–9. and in 943 King Edmund bestowed 15 hides of land at Clere on the 'religious woman Aelfswith'.Birch, Cart. Sax. ii, 530–3. While sixteen years later King Edgar gave his thegn Aelfwine 10 hides of land at West Clere.Birch, Cart. Sax. iii, 268–9. Local legend asserts that King John was troubled by a bedbug during a night in a Kingsclere inn, when prevented by fog from reaching his lodge at Freemantle Park on Cottington's hill. He ordained that the church should erect and evermore maintain upon its tower a representation of the creature that had disturbed his sleep. It is recorded that King John stayed at Freemantle Park on 8 and 9 September 1204Walter Money, Newbury, 1887, page 129. Fairs In 1218, the king ordered that the market which had been held in Kingsclere on Sundays should in the future be held on Saturdays.Close, 2 Henry III, m. 2 Warner, writing in the 18th century, mentions a well-frequented market on Tuesdays, and fairs the first Tuesday in April and the first Tuesday after 10 October.Warner's History of Hampshire, 1795 In 1848 the market was still held on Tuesdays, but had fallen very much into disuse, only a few farmers meeting at the Swan Inn with samples,Post Office Directory of Hants (1848) and it probably ceased altogether about 1850. The fairs continued (c. 1911) to be held—on Whit Tuesday for pleasure on Ashford Hill and the Tuesday after Old Michaelmas Day for hiring servants and pleasure in the market place.Victoria County History, A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 4, William Page, ed. 1911. Inns The former Falcon Inn, in Swan street, one of the oldest in Hampshire, is especially interesting as being at one time in the possession of William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, who in 1510 gave it to Winchester College upon trust for the maintenance and support of the scholars upon its foundation. The original 'Crowne' Inn is mentioned in the parish register in 1611 and the 'Golden Faucon' in 1628. The modern Crown Inn was built in 1853 and the Swan Inn dates back to well before 1848.

He obtained his Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree there, winning a Rhodes scholarship to University College, Oxford, in 1962, where he obtained his Doctor of Philosophy degree with a thesis on the concept of judicial power, with reference to Australian federal constitutional law. , Oxford Law Faculty, retrieved 25 March 2008. Also in 1962, Finnis converted to Roman Catholicism.Greenya, John (2018). Gorsuch: The Judge Who Speaks for Himself. Threshold Editions. Page 47. Finnis was a friend of Aung San Suu Kyi, also an Oxford graduate; and, in 1989, Finnis nominated her for the Nobel Peace Prize. Aung San Suu Kyi won the prize but did not receive it until June 2012, when she recalled how her late husband, Michael Aris, had visited her under house arrest and brought her the news \\"that a friend, John Finnis\\" had nominated her for the prize. Career Finnis is a legal philosopher and author of Natural Law and Natural Rights (1980, 2011), a seminal contribution to the philosophy of law and a restatement of natural law doctrine. For Finnis there are seven basic goods; life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, sociability of friendship, practical reasonableness and religion. In his book on Finnis' student Neil Gorsuch while at Oxford University, John Greenya has described Finnis's views by stating: \\"Some of John Finnis's views are very controversial. For example, in defending his long-held position against same- sex marriage and same-sex coupling, he once compared them to bestiality.\\" Philosopher Stephen Buckle sees Finnis's list of proposed basic goods as plausible, but notes that \\"Finnis's account becomes more controversial when he goes on to specify the basic requirements of practical reasonableness\\". He sees Finnis's requirement that practical reason requires \\"respect for every basic value in every act\\" as intended both to rule out consequentialism in ethics and also to support the moral viewpoint of the Catholic Church on a range of contentious issues, including contraception and masturbation, which in his view undermines its plausibility.Stephen Buckle, \\"Natural Law\\" in Peter Singer (ed.), A Companion to Ethics. Blackwell Publishers, 1997, ch. 13, p. 171. Finnis's work on natural law ethics has been a source of controversy in both neo-Thomist and analytical circles. Craig Paterson sees his work as interesting because it challenges a key assumption of both neo-Thomist and analytical philosophy: the idea that a natural law ethics must be based upon an attempt to derive normative (or \\"ought\\") statements from descriptive (or \\"is\\") statements.Aquinas, Finnis and Non-Naturalism, Craig Paterson, \\"Aquinas, Finnis and Non-Naturalism\\" in Craig Paterson & Matthew Pugh (eds.), Analytical Thomism: Traditions in Dialogue. Ashgate, 2006, ch. 9, pp. 171–93. According to Andrew Sullivan, Finnis has articulated \\"an intelligible and subtle account of homosexuality\\" based on the new natural law, a less biologically-based version of natural law theory. Finnis argues that the state should deter public approval of homosexual behaviour while refusing to persecute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation, basing this position not on the claim that homosexual sex is unnatural but on the idea that it cannot involve the union of procreation and emotional commitment that heterosexual sex can, and is therefore an assault on heterosexual union. Sullivan believes that such a conservative position is vulnerable to criticism on its own terms, since the stability of existing families is better served by the acceptance of those homosexuals who are part of them.Sullivan, Andrew. Virtually Normal: An Argument About Homosexuality. Picador: London, 1996. pp. 98–99 Other scholars, such as Stephen Macedo and Michael J. Perry, have also criticised Finnis's views.Stein, Edward, The Mismeasure of Desire: The Science, Theory, and Ethics of Sexual Orientation. Oxford University Press, 1999. p. 356 He has supervised several PhD students including Neil Gorsuch, Justice Susan Kenny of the Federal Court of Australia, and Robert P. George. In 2013 George and Keown summarised some of Finnis's media work as \\"He has, for example, debated embryo research with Mary Warnock on BBC's Newsnight and with Jonathan Glover in the Channel 4 Debate; discussed euthanasia with a leading Dutch euthanasiast on the same channel's After Dark, and written on eugenic abortion in The Sunday Telegraph\\".Reason, Morality and Law: The Philosophy of John Finnis, edited John Keown and Robert P George, OUP, 2013 In the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours List in Australia, Finnis was appointed a Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia, the country's highest civilian honour for his eminent service as a jurist and legal scholar.

The VOC was formed in 1602 from a government-directed consolidation/amalgamation of several competing Dutch trading companies (the so-called voorcompagnieën). It was possibly in fact the first recorded major industry consolidationDe Jong, Abe; Gelderblom, Oscar; Jonker, Joost (2010), 'An Admiralty for Asia: Isaac le Maire and Conflicting Conceptions About the Corporate Governance of the VOC'. (Working Paper Erasmus Research Institute of Management, 2010)Gelderblom, Oscar; de Jong, Abe; Jonker, Joost (2011), 'An Admiralty for Asia: Business Organization and the Evolution of Corporate Governance in the Dutch Republic, 1590–1640,'; in J.G. Koppell (ed.), Origins of Shareholder Advocacy. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011), pp. 29–70 and is generally one of the most successful consolidations in the history of business.Unoki, Ko (2012), 'A Seafaring Empire,'; in Mergers, Acquisitions and Global Empires: Tolerance, Diversity and the Success of M&A;, by Ko Unoki. (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 39–64 In business, consolidation or amalgamation is the merger and acquisition of many smaller companies into a few much larger ones. In the context of financial accounting, consolidation refers to the aggregation of financial statements of a group company as consolidated financial statements. The taxation term of consolidation refers to the treatment of a group of companies and other entities as one entity for tax purposes. Under the Halsbury's Laws of England, 'amalgamation' is defined as \\"a blending together of two or more undertakings into one undertaking, the shareholders of each blending company, becoming, substantially, the shareholders of the blended undertakings. There may be amalgamations, either by transfer of two or more undertakings to a new company, or to the transfer of one or more companies to an existing company\\". Overview Consolidation is the practice, in business, of legally combining two or more organizations into a single new one. Upon consolidation, the original organizations cease to exist and are supplanted by a new entity. Economic motivation *Access to new technologies/ techniques *Access to new clients *Access to new geographies *Cheaper financing for a bigger company *Seeking for hidden or nonperforming assets belonging to a target company (e.g. real estate) *Bigger companies tend to have superior bargaining power over their suppliers and clients (e.g. Walmart) * Synergies Types of business amalgamations There are three forms of business combinations: *Statutory Merger: a business combination that results in the liquidation of the acquired company's assets and the survival of the purchasing company. *Statutory Consolidation: a business combination that creates a new company in which none of the previous companies survive. *Stock Acquisition: a business combination in which the purchasing company acquires the majority, more than 50%, of the Common stock of the acquired company and both companies survive. *Variable interest entity Terminology *Parent-subsidiary relationship: the result of a stock acquisition where the parent is the acquiring company and the subsidiary is the acquired company. *Controlling Interest: When the parent company owns a majority of the common stock. *Non-Controlling Interest or Minority Interest: the rest of the common stock that the other shareholders own. *Wholly owned subsidiary: when the parent owns all the outstanding common stock of the subsidiary. *In an amalgamation, the companies which merge into a new or existing company are referred to as transferor companies or amalgamating companies. The resultant company is referred to as the transferee company. Accounting treatment (US GAAP) A parent company can acquire another company by purchasing its net assets or by purchasing a majority share of its common stock. Regardless of the method of acquisition; direct costs, costs of issuing securities and indirect costs are treated as follows: * Direct costs, Indirect and general costs: the acquiring company expenses all acquisition related costs as they are incurred. * Costs of issuing securities: these costs reduce the issuing price of the stock. =Purchase of net assets= Treatment to the acquiring company: When purchasing the net assets the acquiring company records in its books the receipt of the net assets and the disbursement of cash, the creation of a liability or the issuance of stock as a form of payment for the transfer. Treatment to the acquired company: The acquired company records in its books the elimination of its net assets and the receipt of cash, receivables or investment in the acquiring company (if what was received from the transfer included common stock from the purchasing company). If the acquired company is liquidated then the company needs an additional entry to distribute the remaining assets to its shareholders. =Purchase of common stock= Treatment to the purchasing company: When the purchasing company acquires the subsidiary through the purchase of its common stock, it records in its books the investment in the acquired company and the disbursement of the payment for the stock acquired. Treatment to the acquired company: The acquired company records in its books the receipt of the payment from the acquiring company and the issuance of stock. FASB 141 disclosure requirements: FASB 141 requires disclosures in the notes of the financial statements when business combinations occur. Such disclosures are: * The name and description of the acquired entity and the percentage of the voting equity interest acquired. * The primary reasons for acquisition and descriptions of factors that contributed to recognition of goodwill. * The period for which results of operations of acquired entity are included in the income statement of the combining entity. * The cost of the acquired entity and if it applies the number of shares of equity interest issued, the value assigned to those interests and the basis for determining that value. * Any contingent payments, options or commitments. * The purchase and development assets acquired and written off. Treatment of goodwill impairments: *If Non-Controlling Interest (NCI) based on fair value of identifiable assets: impairment taken against parent's income & R/E *If NCI based on fair value of purchase price: impairment taken against subsidiary's income & R/E Reporting intercorporate interest—investments in common stock20% ownership or less—investment= When a company purchases 20% or less of the outstanding common stock, the purchasing company's influence over the acquired company is not significant. (APB 18 specifies conditions where ownership is less than 20% but there is significant influence). The purchasing company uses the cost method to account for this type of investment. Under the cost method, the investment is recorded at cost at the time of purchase. The company does not need any entries to adjust this account balance unless the investment is considered impaired or there are liquidating dividends, both of which reduce the investment account. Liquidating dividends : Liquidating dividends occur when there is an excess of dividends declared over earnings of the acquired company since the date of acquisition. Regular dividends are recorded as dividend income whenever they are declared. Impairment loss : An impairment loss occurs when there is a decline in the value of the investment other than temporary. =20% to 50% ownership—associate company= When the amount of stock purchased is between 20% and 50% of the common stock outstanding, the purchasing company's influence over the acquired company is often significant. The deciding factor, however, is significant influence. If other factors exist that reduce the influence or if significant influence is gained at an ownership of less than 20%, the equity method may be appropriate (FASB interpretation 35 (FIN 35) underlines the circumstances where the investor is unable to exercise significant influence). To account for this type of investment, the purchasing company uses the equity method. Under the equity method, the purchaser records its investment at original cost. This balance increases with income and decreases for dividends from the subsidiary that accrue to the purchaser. Treatment of Purchase Differentials: At the time of purchase, purchase differentials arise from the difference between the cost of the investment and the book value of the underlying assets. Purchase differentials have two components: * The difference between the fair market value of the underlying assets and their book value. * Goodwill: the difference between the cost of the investment and the fair market value of the underlying assets. Purchase differentials need to be amortized over their useful life; however, new accounting guidance states that goodwill is not amortized or reduced until it is permanently impaired, or the underlying asset is sold. =More than 50% ownership—subsidiary= When the amount of stock purchased is more than 50% of the outstanding common stock, the purchasing company has control over the acquired company. Control in this context is defined as ability to direct policies and management. In this type of relationship the controlling company is the parent and the controlled company is the subsidiary. The parent company needs to issue consolidated financial statements at the end of the year to reflect this relationship. Consolidated financial statements show the parent and the subsidiary as one single entity. During the year, the parent company can use the equity or the cost method to account for its investment in the subsidiary. Each company keeps separate books. However, at the end of the year, a consolidation working paper is prepared to combine the separate balances and to eliminate the intercompany transactions, the subsidiary's stockholder equity and the parent's investment account. The result is one set of financial statements that reflect the financial results of the consolidated entity. There are three forms of combination: 1\\\\. horizontal integration: is the combination of firms in the same business lines and markets. 2\\\\. vertical integration: is the combination of firms with operations in different but successive stages of production or distribution or both. 3\\\\. Conglomeration: is the combination of firms with unrelated and diverse products or services functions, or both.

Early life and career Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia, where Johnson's work was acclaimed. Johnson was the son of Joseph Johnson, a baker. He had a family background in horticulture. His Scottish maternal grandfather John Forsyth, a florist, was the son of William Forsyth, a botanist who co-founded the Royal Horticultural Society in 1804. Johnson had a successful career designing the grounds for a number of large houses in England, Ireland, and Russia. By 1869, he was the Curator of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Belfast. He subsequently set up a landscape gardening shop on Bond Street in London. He went to the United States of America in 1885 where he was employed by Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York City, as superintendent of horticulture. The park was overgrown and his plan was to create a number of vistas so the entirety of the large park would be visible. This would have necessitated the removal of a large number of trees, which proved unacceptable to the community. As a result, Johnson was terminated from the project. A recommendation in 1887 by New York florist Peter Henderson convinced Joel Hurt to bring Johnson to Atlanta to work on his streetcar suburb, Inman Park. Johnson went to Atlanta and he spent the next five years there. He joined Hurt again for Piedmont Park. In 1891, he designed Latta Park in Charlotte, North Carolina and the next year may have designed the neighborhood of Cloverdale in Montgomery, Alabama. Family He married Elizabeth Trowsdale (born 1832) on 12 January 1861, by whom he had six children: John Forsyth Johnson (born 1861), Charles (born 1862), Georgiana Mary Alice (born 1864), Elizabeth (born 1868), Joseph and Christina (born 1873). He moved to America in 1885 with Frances Clarke, who was then pregnant and who was included on the passenger list as his wife. They had three children: Roy Albert Johnson (1886–1939), Cecil Forsyth Johnson (1887–1951), and Edwina Johnson Mundy (1891–1969). Johnson's great grandson by his first marriage was the British entertainer Bruce Forsyth (1928–2017). Forsyth appeared on the BBC One genealogy television show Who Do You Think You Are? researching his great grandfather Joseph, in particular any information relating to his American family. Despite the question of bigamy arising in this documentary, there is no record for Johnson's marriage to Frances Clarke, although she is shown to have been recorded as both Frances Clarke Johnson and Frances Forsyth Johnson. Death Johnson's American family were informed that he had died while travelling to Great Britain and had been buried at sea. In fact he had abandoned his American family just as he had previously abandoned his English wife and children. The reality was that he had returned to England to visit his family there, later going back to the United States. In the next decade he visited England on several other occasions before he died in Brooklyn, New York in 1906. Johnson was buried there at Evergreen Cemetery in an unmarked grave. He died with only $389 to his name after living for several years in a hotel, leaving no last will or testament. After visiting his great grandfather's unmarked grave at Evergreens Cemetery, Bruce Forsyth commissioned a headstone in memory, to mark Joseph Forsyth Johnson's life and work.Joseph Forsyth Johnson on Findagrave.com Writings *The Natural Principle of Landscape Gardening: Or the Adornment of Land for Perpetual Beauty, Archer and Songs, Belfast, 1874 *Residential Sites and Environments, Their Conveniences, Gardens, Parks and Planting, A.T.Delamare, New York, 1898 *The Laws of Developing Landscape, Showing How to Make Thickets and Woodlands Reveal Their Natural Beauty, Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society 29 (1904–1905), p. 595–624 References *Obituary, Gardening Magazine, Chicago, p. 349 Category:History of Atlanta Category:English landscape architects Category:1840 births Category:1906 deaths Category:Burials at the Cemetery of the Evergreens ","title":"Joseph Forsyth Johnson"},{"id":"2007239","text":"Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska Maria of Austria (17 January 1831 - 14 February 1903) was born in Ofen (Buda), Hungary, the daughter of Palatine Joseph of Hungary (1776–1847) and his third wife Maria Dorothea of Württemberg (1797–1855).

This last was certainly needed if the paper came \\"unsized\\", that is, lacking the thin gelatinous material used to fill the surface of the paper and make it smooth enough for writing with a quill or a steel nib. It was also used to prepare the surface when drafting with Rapidograph pens on mylar, a common drafting medium in the late twentieth century. Although some people claim that pounce was never added afterwards to dry ink, this probably represents confusion between the two processes of preparing paper and drying the ink after writing. Experiment shows that using pounce does indeed smooth \\"unsized\\" paper but then does little or nothing to dry the ink, and it is clearly the case that pouncing or sanding continued long after properly \\"sized\\" writing paper came into general use during the nineteenth century. The pounce or sand is gently sprinkled all over the writing on the paper. When using a quill or a steel nib, and with inks that are made up to match those typically in use during the 18th or 19th centuries, and provided the pen has been used with the fine strokes typical of handwriting of that period, the handwriting will be sufficiently dry within 10 seconds to allow the paper to be folded without blotting. Gently vibrating the paper whilst the pounce or sand is on it ensures that little or no pounce or sand sticks to the handwriting and excess sand or pounce is shaken off before folding the paper. In the 19th century the pounce pots or sanders often had a shallow dish round the top so that pounce or sand could be returned to the pot and reused. The process is very effective for quickly drying ink, and although blotting paper has been available since Tudor times, pounce or sand continued to be used throughout the nineteenth century because it was often cheaper.

The pavilion contained one attraction, Ellen's Energy Adventure, starring Ellen DeGeneres and Bill Nye, which was the second version of the show since the pavilion's 1982 opening. The attraction featured a combination of four separate large-format film presentations and a slow-moving dark ride through audio-animatronic filled sets. The Universe of Energy pavilion was previously sponsored by ExxonMobil (formerly Exxon) from opening day on October 1, 1982, through 2004. The attraction closed permanently on August 13, 2017, being replaced with Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind that will reuse the Universe of Energy's show building. Universe of Energy (1982–1996) The original Universe of Energy pavilion itself was an innovation in energy technology, as the entire roof was covered in 80,000 photovoltaic solar cells that partially powered the ride vehicles. Visitors were transported through the pavilion in large battery-powered \\"traveling theatre cars\\" that followed guide-wires embedded in the floor as opposed to riding along conventional ride tracks. The original attraction featured numerous films that presented information on the subject of energy in a serious fashion as well as a ride through a primeval diorama complete with audio-animatronic dinosaurs. =Pre-show= The original pre-show featured an eight-minute live-action film presentation about the various forms of energy found in nature and traced the history of how mankind harnessed these different forms of energy for his use. This unique film presentation was known as the Kinetic Mosaic and was invented by Czech film director Emil Radok. The mosaic screen consisted of 100 rotating prism-shaped flip screens (reminiscent of those on the classic game show Concentration), arranged in a twenty five wide by four high array. These flip screens rotated under computer control and were synchronized to the motion picture that was projected onto their surface via five synchronized motion picture projectors. Each flip screen contained three sides, with white projection surfaces on two sides and a matte black surface on the third. The combination of the film and the screens' rotation created undulating, sometimes three-dimensional-appearing images. During the conclusion of the pre-show, the song Energy (You Make The World Go ‘Round) was played. =Theatre I film= Upon entering the theatre, guests were seated in one of six sections. The seating area rotated 180 degrees to face three large movie screens for the first film: a four-minute hand-animated film that depicted the beginnings of life on earth and the formation of fossil fuels. =Primeval diorama= At the conclusion of the film, the seating area rotated 90 degrees to face a curtain, which then raised to reveal a primeval diorama. The entire seating area moved into the diorama where it then broke apart into six multi-passenger vehicles that took guests on a seven-minute journey through the diorama, which was populated by numerous animatronic dinosaurs including an Edaphosaurus and two Arthropleura fighting and a family of Brontosaurus in a swamp (complete with realistic \\"swampy\\" smell), a Stegosaurus fighting an Allosaurus on an overhead cliff, several Trachodon bathing beneath a waterfall, a number of Ornithomimus watching helplessly as one of their own sank into a boiling tar pit, an Elasmosaurus that lashed out of a tidal pool at guests, and numerous Pteranodon that were perched around an erupting volcano (complete with flowing lava and realistic \\"volcano\\" smell). =Theatre II film= Leaving the diorama, the vehicles entered the EPCOT Energy Information Center where they reassembled back into their original theatre seating formation. Here, guests viewed a twelve-minute live-action film on three giant wrap around screens that took them on an in-depth look at various current and future energy resources around the world. =Theatre I finale film= At the conclusion of the film, the screens raised and the entire seating area traveled beneath them into Theatre I and rotated back into its starting position facing the audience towards a large cylindrical-shaped screen. There, guests viewed a two-minute computer-animated film that was reflected off of mirrored walls within the theatre. The film depicted an ever- evolving landscape of colorful, laser-like imagery of the various ways mankind has benefited from harnessing energy for his use and was accompanied by an upbeat song entitled Universe of Energy. =Summer 1996 version = The Summer of 1996 saw many changes come to Future World East. World of Motion closed in January in preparation for its conversion into Test Track, and Horizons was not operating consistently due to alleged structural issues with the pavilion. The updated films for the attraction were behind schedule, meaning that Future World East would only have the Wonders of Life pavilion open for the peak summer season. The decision was made to reopen Universe of Energy after renovations had been made to the pavilion in preparation for the new show. This temporary version of the show featured the original 1982 films, but lacked some of the effects. Most notably, the Kinetic Mosaic screen from the original pre-show had been removed resulting in the film being projected onto static screens, losing the shape-shifting effect of the film. Also removed were the maps and television monitors on the wall in the Epcot Energy Information Center in Theatre II, having already been replaced by the KNRG radio tower backdrop for the new show. For this scene, a new narration played that covered much of the same information as the original narration minus any mention of the maps and monitors. In Theatre I, the mirrors on the walls had already been removed by this point, resulting in a much less dramatic version of the finale film. During this period, some elements for the new show had already been installed in preparation for the new show and had to be hidden. This included the Audio-Animatronic figure of Ellen DeGeneres in the diorama. To solve this, temporary rockwork was placed in front of the figure hiding it from view. However, the elasmosaurus figure had already been reprogrammed for the new show, leading to the awkward result of having it lunge at rocks instead of the ride vehicles as it had originally done. This version of the show only ran from June 14 to September 2, 1996. The pavilion was closed again soon after peak season to allow for the installation of the new films for the new version of the attraction. Ellen's Energy Adventure (1996–2017) Ellen's Energy Adventure starred Ellen DeGeneres, Bill Nye \\"The Science Guy\\", Jamie Lee Curtis, Alex Trebek, and Johnny Gilbert. It took a light-hearted look at various energy resources, how energy was produced, the history of energy production, and the search for new energy resources. In particular it focused on the origins of fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal and natural gas. It also mentioned renewable sources such as solar and hydroelectric power. In 2011, Ellen's Energy Adventure surpassed the original Universe of Energy show as the longest running version of the attraction. The second version of the show reused the traveling theater system of the original Universe of Energy show. The primeval diorama used essentially the same sets and Audio-Animatronic dinosaurs as the original show, although during the renovation to the Ellen's Energy Adventure show, all of the dinosaurs were repainted in much brighter colors, and several audio-animatronic figures were added along with an upbeat musical score to help tie it into the new film footage. =Pre-show theatre film= Guests viewed an eight-minute film in which Ellen DeGeneres falls asleep and dreams that she is in an energy-themed version of Jeopardy!, playing against an old college rival Judy Peterson (Curtis) and Albert Einstein (Benny Wasserman). Not knowing anything about energy, Ellen fell way behind Judy. At the end of the first round, Bill Nye the Science Guy stepped in and offered to help teach Ellen about energy during the commercial break. =Theatre I film= Upon entering the theatre, guests were seated in one of six sections. The seating area rotated 180 degrees to face three large movie screens for the first film: a four-minute computer animated film in which Bill took Ellen back billions of years in time to witness the Big Bang and the formation of the earth. Finally, they ended up in a prehistoric jungle where he briefly explained how fossil fuels were formed. =Primeval diorama= Brontosaurus in the Universe of Energy At the conclusion of the film, the seating area rotated 90 degrees to face a curtain, which then rose to reveal the primeval diorama. The entire seating area moved into the diorama where it then broke apart into six multi-passenger vehicles that took guests on a seven-minute journey through the diorama, which was populated by numerous audio-animatronic dinosaurs including an Edaphosaurus, two Arthropleura fighting and a family of Brontosaurus in a swamp (one of whom sneezed water onto guests), a Stegosaurus fighting an Allosaurus on an overhead cliff, several Trachodon bathing beneath a waterfall, a number of Ornithomimus drinking from a pond (one of whom spit water at guests), an Audio-Animatronic Ellen standing near a tidal pool fighting off an Elasmosaurus with a tree branch, and numerous Pteranodon perched around an erupting volcano. After November 2014, the Audio-Animatronic figure of Ellen fighting off the Elasmosaurus with a tree branch stopped working and was removed. It was replaced with a group of smaller Pteranodons. =Theatre II film= Leaving the diorama, the vehicles entered a second theatre where they reassembled back into their original theatre seating formation. After listening to a brief prehistoric broadcast from KNRG News Radio (which featured the voices of Willard Scott and Chris Berman), guests viewed a twelve-minute live-action film on three giant wrap around screens in which Bill Nye took Ellen on an in-depth look at various current and future energy resources across the United States. Actor Michael Richards made a brief cameo as a caveman near the beginning of the film. =Theatre I finale film= At the conclusion of the film, the screens rose and the entire seating area traveled beneath them back into Theatre I and rotated back into its original starting position facing the audience towards a large television-shaped screen. The final two minute film presented the end of Ellen's dream in which she used her new knowledge about energy in the Double Jeopardy! round to unseat Judy as Jeopardy! champion. Timeline Ride vehicle and track * October 1, 1982 — The pavilion opens with the original Universe of Energy show. * January 21, 1996 — The original Universe of Energy show and pavilion are closed for refurbishment. * June 14, 1996 — The fully refurbished pavilion temporarily reopens in an effort to help handle the park's busy summer crowds.

It is the administrative headquarters of Ghaziabad district and is the largest city in western Uttar Pradesh, with a population of 1,729,000. Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation is divided into 5 zones - City Zone, Kavi Nagar Zone, Vijay Nagar Zone, Mohan Nagar Zone and Vasundhara Zone. The Municipal Corporation comprises 100 wards. Well connected by roads and railways, it is a major rail junction for North India. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Gateway of Uttar Pradesh\\" because it is close to New Delhi, on the main route into Uttar Pradesh. Recent construction works have led to the city being described by a City Mayors Foundation survey as the second fastest-growing in the world.Ghaziabad was first listed in early 2010 as # 420 by size. , current listings: Situated in the Upper Gangetic Plains, the city has two major divisions separated by the Hindon River, namely Trans- Hindon on the west and Cis-Hindon on the east. History Delhi Gate, Ghaziabad The city of Ghaziabad was founded in 1740 A.D. by Ghazi-ud-Din, who served as a wazir in the court of Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah, and named it as \\"Ghaziuddinnagar\\" after his own name.Anu Kapur, p. 83-85, Mapping Place Names of India The name \\"Ghaziuddinnagar\\" was shortened to its present form, i.e. \\"Ghaziabad\\" with the opening of the Railways in 1864. During the Mughal period, Ghaziabad and especially the banks of the Hindon in Ghaziabad, remained a picnic spot for the Mughal royal family. Establishment of the Scientific Society here, during the same period is considered as a milestone of the educational movement launched by Syed Ahmad Khan. The Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway, connecting Delhi and Lahore, up till Ambala through Ghaziabad was opened in the same year. With the completion of the Amritsar-Saharanpur- Ghaziabad line of the Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway in 1870, Delhi was connected to Multan through Ghaziabad, and Ghaziabad became the junction of the East Indian Railway and Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway. Indirapuram is a major area in Ghaziabad. Ghaziabad, along with Meerut and Bulandshahr, remained one of the three Munsifis of the District, under the Meerut Civil Judgeship during most periods of the British Raj. Ghaziabad was associated with the Indian independence movement from the Indian Rebellion of 1857. =Industrial growth= Although connected by railway since 1865, it was not until 1940 that the first modern industry appeared in Ghaziabad. However, it was in the post-independence period that industry really expanded, with a further 22 factories opening in the four years after 1947. This development can be attributed to the influx of people from the newly formed Pakistan and the relocation of businesses from what was now the Pakistani province of Punjab. John Oakey and Mohan Ltd., one of India's largest concerns manufacturing coated and bonded abrasives, and originally functioning under the name of 'National Abrasives' at Rawalpindi was shifted here under the proprietorship of 'Dyer Meakins' in 1947. Subsequently, the Mohan Meakin breweries were also set up in the year 1949. This period also saw the development of Ghaziabad as one of India's most famous centres of the Oil Engines industry. In 1967, the municipal limits were extended up to the Delhi- UP border. Starting in the early 1970s, many steel-manufacturing units also came up in the city making it one of the primary industries of the city. This period also saw the emergence of the Electronics industry, with the setting up of Bharat Electronics Limited and Central Electronics Limited Over the years, planned Industrial development saw participation from major industrial houses of the country including Mohans (Mohan Nagar Industrial Estate, 1949), Tatas (Tata Oil Mills), Modis (Modinagar, 1933; International Tobacco Co. 1967), Shri Rams (Shri Ram Pistons, 1964), Jaipurias etc. and also significant participation through foreign capital in concerns such as Danfoss India Ltd. (estd. 1968); Indo- Bulgar Food Ltd. and International Tobacco Company (estd. 1967). DemographicsPopulation= The provisional data derived from the 2011 census shows that Ghaziabad urban agglomeration had a population of 2,358,525, of which males were 1,256,783 and females were 1,101,742. The literacy rate was 93.81%. Ghaziabad is a subcategory B1 district of category B i.e. having socioeconomic parameters below the national average. It is the second largest industrial city in Uttar Pradesh after Kanpur. =Religion= Hinduism is the most popular religion in Ghaziabad with 72.93% followers, followed by 25.35% Muslim followers, 0.41 Christian followers, and 0.49% Sikh followers who make up the smallest percentage of followers in the city. There are around 0.07 Buddhists, 0.35% Jain followers who are minorities. There are many religious sites in Ghaziabad such as the ISKCON Temple for Hindus, Jama Masjid for Muslims, Holy Trinity Church for Christians, and Shri Guru Singh Sabha Gurudwara for Sikhs. Climate As it is connected to the national capital, its temperature and rainfall are similar to Delhi. Rajasthan's dust storms and snowfall in the Himalayas, Kumaon and Garhwal hills name their impact in the weather regularly. The monsoon arrives in the district at the end of June or the first week of July and normally it rains until October. As in other districts of northern India mainly three seasons - summer, winter and rainy - prevail here, but sometimes due to severe snowfall in the Himalayas and Kumaon Hills, adverse weather can also be seen. Due to a number of construction and highway projects causing cutting down hundreds of old trees rapidly, the pollution and rising temperature issues have increased significantly.  Government and politics  Ghaziabad city is governed by the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation, which is headed by Dinesh Chandra, the current Municipal Commissioner and Mayor Asha Sharma from the BJP. The city is represented in the Lok Sabha through one MP elected from the Lok Sabha constituency represented by Vijay Kumar Singh from the BJP, and one MLA elected from the Vidhan Sabha constituency, represented by BJP's Atul Garg elected in 2017. = City Government = Ghaziabad city is spread over 210 sq. km of municipal area. It upgraded from a Municipal Board to a Municipal Corporation on 31 August 1994, following the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act. Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (or Nagar Nigam Ghaziabad) is divided into 5 zones - City Zone, Kavi Nagar Zone, Vijay Nagar Zone, Mohan Nagar Zone and Vasundhara Zone. The Municipal Corporation comprises 100 wards. The local elections to all wards was last held in 2017. = Civic utilities = Other development agencies of the city include the Ghaziabad Development Authority, UP Jal Nigam. The masterplan for the city is laid by the Town & Country Planning Department, Uttar Pradesh, which is department under Department of Housing and Urban Planning for the state. The corporation supplies water and has nearly 2.35 lakh water connections, supplying nearly 388 MLD of water per day. The city also receives water from the Ganga through 50 cusec (one cubic foot of water flow per second which translates into 28.32 litres) and 100 cusec plants but a lot of areas in the city constituting multi-storied apartments do not receive Ganga water and rely on groundwater. Treated water is supplied to only 36.2% of households. The municipality, as well as UP Jal Nigam sets up sewage treatment plants and water treatment plants for the city. The Ghaziabad Development Authority is responsible for laying networks of sewer lines and piped drinking water supply. Drinking water remains a concern with 55.6% of households accessing it from tube wells, bore wells and hand pumps. Only 30.5% households are connected to piped sewer lines. As of 2019, Ghaziabad generates 1,000 metric tonnes of waste daily, some of which is sent to Meerut, while 300 metric tonnes are sent to Pilkhuwa, while almost 200 metric tons is used in various GMC owned parks to create compost. The corporation also dumps garbage in Indirapuram landfill site, and would dump it in Pratap Vihar landfill till they stopped on the orders of a National Green Tribunal committee. The corporation also announced in September 2020 that it was creating 10 'garbage factories' as a permanent solution to the city's waste problem. TransportRoad= A proposal has been made to widen National Highway 24 (NH-24) from four to fourteen lanes on the stretch between the Ghaziabad-Delhi border and Dasna. Many residential and commercial projects are being built along the highway. =Rail= The city receives Indian Railways service at Ghaziabad Junction Railway Station. The Delhi Metro Red Line serves Ghaziabad, with eight stations. The Red Line's eastern terminus, Shaheed Sthal metro station, is located in this city. Other stations include Hindon River Station which serves Raj Nagar Extension and Mohan Nagar Station. Another station exists at Vaishali, which serves that area as well as Vasundhara and Indirapuram, and there is also a station at Kaushambi. Residential apartments near Vaishali Metro Station, Ghaziabad =Air= Hindon Domestic Airport is the airport serving Ghaziabad which will begin operation in October 2019. The closest international airport is the Indira Gandhi International Airport. Hindon Domestic Airport currently only goes to Pithoragarh, Uttarakhand and Hubli, Karnataka.UDAN flights from Hindon airport, Ghaziabad, will connect to Hubli, Jamnagar, Shimla, Kalburgi, Kannur, Nashik, Faizabad, Pithoragarh Livemint Sports The Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium is a Cricket stadium in Ghaziabad.And Mahamaya Sports stadium is multi-purpose Sports Stadium in City.

The final edition was published on September 23, 2005. In its last full year, its average daily circulation was 7,544, down from 8,948 the previous year. History In 1850 John Cantley, a merchant from Tuscaloosa, established the Elyton Herald, Jefferson County's first newspaper. The early years of the newspaper were marked by frequent changes of name and ownership. In the 1860s, Cantley sold the weekly paper to Henry A. Hale. In 1871, the year that the new industrial center of Birmingham was incorporated, Hale sold the business to R. H. Henley, who was also Birmingham's first mayor. Henley renamed the paper the Birmingham Sun and published it himself for the first six months, before selling it to Thomas McLaughlin and James Matthews, who again changed the name to The Jefferson Independent. The Independent lasted for two years before it was bought by Willis Roberts and Frank M. Grace, who again changed the name, this time to The Weekly Iron Age. In 1881, the paper again changed hands. The new owners, W. C. Garrett and R. H. Thornton, again changed the name to The Daily Birmingham Age and began daily publication for the first time. With the addition of national and world news items from the Associated Press the Age reached a peak of success, ranking second only to The Atlanta Constitution in the Southern market in advertising dollars. In 1887 Rufus N. Rhodes founded a rival newspaper, The Daily Herald appeared on the streets of Birmingham. After a year as competitors, the two papers merged on November 8, 1888, to form The Birmingham Age-Herald. This combined paper was sold in 1896 to an upstart rival, The Daily State. For two years it was published under the Daily State Herald masthead before controlling interest was sold to E. W. Barrett and the Age-Herald name restored. During this time, E. W. Barrett died and his widow sold the Age-Herald to Frederick I. Thompson, Donald Comer and B. B. Comer. In 1927 the paper was sold to another rival, Victor H. Hanson, publisher of The Birmingham News. Hanson published both papers simultaneously, the Age-Herald in the morning and The Birmingham News in the evenings. On Sundays, a joint Birmingham News Age-Herald edition was distributed. Another merger occurred in 1950 when the Age-Herald joined with the Scripps-Howard-owned Birmingham Post, which had grown to a large circulation since its founding in 1921 by Ed Leech. By the terms of the merger, the News and Post-Herald became independent papers published under a joint operating agreement. Circulation, advertising and printing were provided by The Birmingham News Company. The Post-Herald published on weekday mornings while the News became the sole evening and Sunday paper. The Post-Herald figured in several episodes of the Civil Rights Movement. Post-Herald photographer Tommy Langston's 1961 image of Ku Klux Klan members attacking Freedom Riders attracted national attention because it showed FBI informant Gary Thomas Rowe in the violent mob. Langston himself was badly beaten after making the picture. In 1962, Post-Herald editor Jimmy Mills was arrested for publishing an election-day editorial suggesting how citizens should vote. Mills fought his conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which held in Mills v. Alabama that the state could not prohibit campaigning on election day. Decline In 1996, the News Company instigated a switch between the morning and evening publications, again creating a joint weekend edition (distributed on Saturdays). This move reinforced The News' pre-eminent role in a time when morning papers are the norm. Toward the end of its existence, the Post-Herald adopted a niche of emphasizing more detailed local stories and featuring well-known local columnists, including Paul Finebaum. The long-expected closure was announced to staffers and then to the public by E. W. Scripps executives on the morning of September 22, 2005, the day before the final edition. The announcement said that the Birmingham market could simply no longer support two newspapers, thus continuing a trend of big- city afternoon newspapers either folding or merging with morning newspapers. Writer Clarke Stallworth held the distinction of writing the lead story for the front page of both the first and last editions of the Post-Herald.

The lithosphere is bent upwards by plate stresses, and is not in isostatic equilibrium (distinguish from the \\"outer ridge\\" of a forearc). Characteristics Typically, the gravity field over the outer swell is about 50 mGal (0.5 mm/s²) higher than expected from isostasy, while gravity over the trench is about 200 mGal (2 mm/s²) less than that expected from isostatic considerations. The bending of the plate is associated with tension in the upper 20 km, and shallow earthquakes, caused by tensional failure induced by the downward bending of the oceanic plate are common; about 20 extensional outer rise earthquakes with magnitude 5 or greater occur annually. Most tension axes are perpendicular to the trench, independent of the direction of relative motion between the two plates, indicating that failure is controlled by bending stresses in the plate. Plate bending also causes deeper (down to 50 km) earthquakes due to compression. The wavelength and amplitude of this flexure can be used to constrain the state of stress across the plate boundary. The width of the outer rise is directly related to the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere. The thickness of the elastic lithosphere varies between 20 and 30 km for most trench profiles. Faulting related to plate bending and stair-stepping of the descending slab into the trench may allow seawater to infiltrate deep into the crust and perhaps upper mantle. This may lead to large scale formation of serpentinite in the upper mantle of the downgoing plate (Ranero et al., 2003). Faulting of the downgoing plate results in a horst and graben structure that allows sediment that reaches the trench to be deposited in graben and carried downward. This faulting also breaks up seamounts as they approach the trench. The principal mechanism of frontal erosion may reflect combined effects of seamount tunneling, mass wasting and transport to the trench, deposition in a graben on the downgoing plate, and descent into the mantle. Outer trench swells are geoscientific frontiers and much remains to be learned about them. Recent volcanoes have been discovered on ~135-million-year-old Pacific Plate east of Japan (Hirano et al., 2006). These small alkalic volcanoes are small percent melts of asthenosphere that exploit bending-related lithospheric faults to reach the seafloor. Hirano et al., (2006) proposed that these small volcanoes erupted along lithospheric fractures in response to plate flexure during subduction. If bending-related faulting and serpentinization is an important process beneath outer trench swells, there are probably also abundant low-temperature hydrothermal vents on the swells, similar to those of the Lost City (hydrothermal field).

He is best known for his numerous expeditions in the Karakoram range, where he participated in the first ascent of Gasherbrum II (8,034 m, 26,358 ft). Moravec was the founder of the Glockner-Kaprun mountaineering school. Life Fritz Moravec was born on 27 April 1922 in the Favoriten tenth district of Vienna, Austria. After an apprenticeship as a motor mechanic, he studied mechanical engineering at the Technical University of Vienna. He developed a love of mountaineering from his father, a locomotive engineer, who served as a military mountain guide in the Dolomites during World War I. I 1942, Moravec served in one of the mountain units in the Caucasus during World War II. After returning to Austria after the war in 1946, Moravec continued to study psychology and education and became a teacher in a specialized school for locksmithing. He spent his spare time with youth groups in the mountains, as in the Gesäuse, and led climbing courses. Moravec specialized in ice climbing. After 1950, he began climbing in the Western Alps, and by 1954 he climbed for the first time in the Himalayas to Saipal. On 7 July 1956 he ascended Gasherbrum II with Josef Larch and Hans Willenpart. In the coming years, he participated in numerous other expeditions to the Spitsbergen, Dhaulagiri, and to Africa. For some time, Moravec's ascent of Gasherbrum II was questioned because he was not visible in summit photos. On 25 September 1995, in a lecture on Himalayan mountaineering held at Vienna's City Hall, Moravec stated: In 1959, Moravec led an Austrian expedition to Dhaulagiri. As the team approached the summit on 27 May 1959, they were forced to turn back due to poor weather conditions—a mere 300 m from their goal. Although the summit attempt failed, Moravec's team prepared the way and identified the route on the northeast ridge that would be used by the Swiss expedition the following year. In 1962, Moravec was approached to participate in a Dutch Himalayan expedition. At the same time, he was approached by naturalists who wanted him to build a climbing school. Moravec chose the latter project, and soon founded the Glockner-Kaprun mountaineering school and remained its leader for thirty years. He created training programs for ten to thirteen-year-olds which are still recognized worldwide. Moravec died on 17 March 1997 in Vienna. He was buried in Hietzinger cemetery. Following his death, his mountaineering school was renamed the Fritz Moravec High Mountain School in his honour.

The name is taken from Tiamat, a goddess in ancient Mesopotamian mythology. She is the queen and mother of evil dragons and a member of the default pantheon of Dungeons & Dragons gods. Her symbol is a five-headed dragon.Greenwood, Ed, Sean K Reynolds, Skip Williams, and Rob Heinsoo. Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (Wizards of the Coast, 2001).

Her potential arrival is the conclusion to the adventures Hoard of the Dragon Queen and Rise of Tiamat.Hoard of the Dragon Queen (Wizards of the Coast, August 2014).Rise of Tiamat (Wizards of the Coast, December 2014). Description Tiamat has been known to manifest as a dark-haired human sorceress. In most Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings, however, Tiamat is the five-headed queen of the evil chromatic dragons. She has one head for each customary color of chromatic dragon (black, blue, green, red, white), and each head has the powers of a member of the respective race of dragonkind. Her body is a blending of various chromatic dragon forms with an appropriately multicolored hide. Her body also has traits in common with a wyvern, including a long tail tipped with a poisonous stinger. Tiamat was also one of the first deities to have aspects, or lesser avatars. These aspects may appear as powerful versions of her chromatic children or as versions of her own five-headed form. One such multiheaded aspect was released in the Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures expansion set War of the Dragon Queen, with detailed role-playing game statistics in Dragon Magic.Stephens, Owen K.C. and Rodney Thompson. Dragon Magic (Wizards of the Coast, 2006). A smaller aspect of Tiamat first appeared in the Miniatures Handbook.Tweet, Jonathan, and Mike Donais, Skaff Elias, and Rob Heinsoo. Miniatures Handbook (Wizards of the Coast, 2003). =Relationships= Like most other draconic deities, Tiamat is the offspring of the dragon creator deity Io. She is the eternal rival of her brother Bahamut, the ruler of the good metallic dragons. It is hinted that her overt hatred toward Bahamut has developed, over a vast period of time, into a twisted lust for her brother as well. She dwells in Avernus, the first layer of the Outer Plane of Baator (also known as the Nine Hells). The first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons named her as the ruler of Avernus; later editions reserved the rulership of the layers of Baator for powerful baatezu (devils). In many campaign settings, the draconic pantheon of gods consists of Io, Aasterinian, Bahamut, Chronepsis, Faluzure, Sardior, and Tiamat. Three Baatezu nobles (granted to her by Bel) serve Tiamat and command her armies on Avernus. Malphas leads 40 companies of abishai, Amduscias leads 29 companies of abishai, and Goap leads three companies of erinyes. With Pearza of the Dark Eight, Tiamat created the first abishai. Tiamat presently has five consorts, who are great wyrms of each chromatic dragon species. Previous consorts include Apsu, Kingsu, Ephelomon, the red dragon Etiol, and the now-undead dragon Dragotha. Three of Tiamat's children were detailed in Dragon #260. An- Ur, the Wandering Death, wanders the Ethereal Plane, devouring whole demiplanes.Statistics and description of An-Ur at Scott Greene's Creature Catalogue. It supposedly sprang into being from Tiamat's \\"first breath\\", which may have been the name of one of her consorts, though An-Ur resembles no draconic species, except perhaps the ethereal moonstone dragons. Dhakoth the Corruptor was born on the Negative Energy Plane; its father is unknown. Mordukhavar the Reaver is the offspring of Tiamat and Cantrum of the Dark Eight. Kurtulmak is also her son, at least according to some myths. Periodically Tiamat has battles with the Babylonian god Marduk, who dwells in Arcadia. She also battles Bahamut, her Lawful Good counterpart. Heironeous and Moradin also consider themselves her enemies. Tiamat claims not to need allies, although she has many pacts with Bel and with lawful evil deities such as Hextor. In 4th Edition, Tiamat is at war with Zehir ever since she first invaded his realm of Tytherion. While the two gods are not openly fighting right now, they are far from allies; the current situation can mainly be regarded as a temporary cease-fire. =Realm= Tiamat's realm, known as the Dragonspawn Pits of Azharul or simply as Tiamat's lair, sprawls in a cluster of tall hills and mountains near a pillar made from the tormented heads of liars and a pit of maggots from which lemures emerge. One must fly or swim across the maggot pit to reach Tiamat's caves. Tiamat's lair contains the main gate to the second of the Nine Hells, Dis. To reach it, one must pass a chamber known as the Cave of Greed, which is filled with cursed treasure that compels the weak-willed to try to steal it. Tiamat has her own chamber within the complex, as do each of her five consorts, but it is possible to travel to Dis without disturbing her. In the 4th edition cosmology, Tiamat shares the Astral Dominion of Tytherion, the Endless Night, with Zehir. Zehir was the original ruler, but Tiamat invaded intending to take the entire realm for herself. She successfully drove Zehir and his forces out of the caverns they loved, but she misjudged the strength and determination of the Midnight Serpent. The result is the bizarre allocation of Tytherion today: Tiamat rules the caves of Tytherion far beneath the skies and mountains she prefers, while Zehir rules the mountains above, far above the caverns and trenches his followers prefer. Although both would prefer to exchange their realms, they are too proud to actually do anything about it. In the Forgotten Realms, Tiamat's realm is still located in the Nine Hells. She later grew in power to claim a realm of her own, but it was later destroyed. After a series of defeats and setbacks and seeing Bahamut rise in power, she pledged her allegiance to Bane and now resides in the Black Hand's realm of Banehold. Cult Tiamat is a greedy, vain, and arrogant goddess who embodies all the strengths of evil dragonkind, and few of their weaknesses. The Queen of Evil Dragons demands reverence, homage, supplication, and tribute from her subjects. She is sometimes called \\"Her Dark Majesty\\" or simply \\"Dark Queen\\". Tiamat is most concerned with spreading evil, defeating good, and propagating chromatic dragons. She never forgives a slight. Although she is not averse to razing the occasional village, her true schemes are subtle and hard to detect. She has been compared to a puppeteer manipulating her creations from within shadows. =Worship= Although she claims dominance over all evil dragons (and despite her misleading title, Queen of Chaos), Tiamat's priests, who are known as Wyrmlairds or Wyrmkeepers, are either neutral evil or lawful evil. Tiamat's church has a rigid hierarchy, beginning with the lowly Custodians of the Copper Chalice and continuing with, in ascending rank, the Defenders of the Silver Shield, Wardens of the Electrum Mail, Guardians of the Gold Scepter, Keepers of the Platinum Crown, Scales of the White Wyrm, Horns of the Black Beast, Wings of the Green Gargantua, Talons of the Blue Baatoran, Breaths of the Red Ravager, and the Dark Scaly Ones leading them all. The ceremonial garb of a humanoid priest of Tiamat is a form-fitting suit of scales. Dragons or those whose scales naturally cover their bodies do not require this. Adventuring garb typically includes scale mail, and priests are preoccupied with gathering treasure and undermining other faiths. Few humans or other humanoids worship Tiamat, but her children, the chromatic dragons, all acknowledge her sovereignty. Blue and green dragons obey her most readily. The grotesque reptilian creatures known as the spawn of Tiamat worship her as their mother. Kobolds may also revere her as their progenitor. Prayers to the Dragon Queen focus on the promise of filling the world with evil dragons and either destroying it or dominating it utterly. =Rituals= Temples to Tiamat are often built within the lairs of long-dead dragons. They are filled with piles of wealth to be sacrificed to the Chromatic Dragon, as well as traps to keep out heretics and the unfaithful. Few dragons keep shrines to her in their own lairs, because they fear that she might notice their hoards and demand a portion thereof. The two most important daily ceremonies are the Tithing and the Rite of Respect. The former is an offering of a small amount of treasure to the goddess; the tithe is cupped in the priest's hands or talons, and when a prayer is completed, the valuables have sometimes (10% of the time) simply vanished. The Rite of Respect is performed by non-dragons; it is a complicated ceremony of kow-towing in the presence of a dragon or other spawn of Tiamat. Evil dragons celebrate great victories by torturing prisoners and committing other atrocities in Tiamat's name. Myths and legendsVorel= Tiamat's enmity with Bahamut dates back to their creation, when Io made them; they were made with the intention of becoming complements and mates, but their personalities were too much at odds. Tiamat murdered Vorel, their elder sibling, and tried to frame Bahamut for the deed. Io realized who was truly to blame and banished Tiamat from his presence. =The Violation of Tiamat's Lair= In one kobold creation myth, Kurtulmak owes his existence to an assault launched on Tiamat by an army of thieves shortly after she had laid a clutch of eggs. Badly injured and with her lair heavily damaged, she caused one of her eggs to hatch, thus creating Kurtulmak. The newly hatched godling quickly began creating a defensive perimeter of traps and restoring the caverns. During the process, Kurtulmak found an egg of Tiamat's that had fallen away from the nest and, deeming it had been away for too long to ever hatch naturally, used his magic to cause it to hatch, thus producing miniature versions of himself: the first kobolds. =The Banishment of Tiamat= Many myths claim that Tiamat lived for a long time on the Prime Material Plane, seeding it with evil dragons and dark magic. Eventually she was banished to the Nine Hells by Bahamut and a sky/sun god (perhaps Pelor or Heironeous). In various campaign settingsDragonlance= In the Dragonlance campaign setting, Tiamat's equivalent is Takhisis, the Dark Queen. =Forgotten Realms= In the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, Tiamat is one of the few surviving gods of the Untheric pantheon (based on Sumerian and Babylonian mythology), battled Marduk in ages past, and is also a member of the draconic pantheon, daughter of Io, the slayer of Gilgeam the God-king of Unther, \\"Nemesis of the Gods\\". In the 4th edition version of the Forgotten Realms, she is the sole survivor of the Untheric pantheon, and now spends most of her time as the goddess of chromatic dragons. =Eberron= In the Eberron campaign setting, Tiamat is a bound demon lord from the Age of Demons, when dragons and couatl worked together to bind the children of Khyber beneath the earth. She now sits imprisoned in the Pit of Sorrows on the draconic continent of Argonnessen, birthing evil dragonspawn and corrupting the good dragons who watch over her prison. Tiamat in other games and media Various monsters called Tiamat, patterned after the Dungeons & Dragons character, have appeared in other fantasy games, particularly role-playing video games. * In the 1983-1985 Dungeons & Dragons TV series, Tiamat is the arch enemy of Venger and a recurring threat to the protagonists, whenever she encounters them.

Capital offers a range of products focused on active management, including more than 40 mutual funds through its subsidiary, American Funds Distributors, as well as separately managed accounts (or collective investment trusts), private equity, investment services for high net worth investors in the U.S., and a range of other offerings for institutional clients and individual investors globally. History In 1931, Jonathan Bell Lovelace founded the investment firm, Lovelace, Dennis & Renfrew, which would eventually become Capital Group. Lovelace had previously been a partner in the stock brokerage firm E.E. MacCrone, where he explored the concept of developing an open-end mutual fund. He eventually sold his stake in that company, just prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.

His next group was a local band called The Urge, which he joined when 17 years old. Fatigue from performing with them seven nights a week in local clubs and pubs led him to fall asleep on his job as an apprentice metalworker, which resulted in his dismissal. Alongside John Miles, he was a member of The Influence. Thompson joined Roxy Music in 1971 and was credited as drummer on six albums, as well as touring and performing on solo records with his bandmates Bryan Ferry, Brian Eno, Andy Mackay and Phil Manzanera. In 1980, Thompson took leave from Roxy Music due to a thumb injury. Later that year he left the band, owing to musical differences between himself and Bryan Ferry. During this period Thompson played with rock band Concrete Blonde. In 1987 Thompson joined the RAF in Squadron 2624 RAuxAF (County of Oxfordshire) attaining the rank of corporal, he left in 1993. In 2001, he reunited with fellow Roxy Music band members for a tour. He also toured with Ferry, supporting his Frantic album in 2003 and also appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival 2005 on 11 June 2005.. Thompson played live gigs with Andy Mackay The Metaphors and was credited on their C.D \\"London! Paris! New York! Rome!\\" in 2009. He joined the Newcastle upon Tyne Lindisfarne in 2013. Influence and following Drummer Roger Taylor of the new wave band Duran Duran has stated that Thompson's drumming was a big influence over his development. Fans of Thompson nicknamed him \\"The Great Paul Thompson\\", because of his drumming skills and power.

Brown (2007), The Canonization of al-Bukhārī and Muslim: The Formation and Function of the Sunnī Ḥadīth Canon, p.10. Brill Publishers. . Quote: \\"We can discern three strata of the Sunni hadith canon. The perennial core has been the Sahihayn. Beyond these two foundational classics, some fourth/tenth-century scholars refer to a four- book selection that adds the two Sunans of Abu Dawood (d. 275/889) and al- Nasa'i (d. 303/915). The Five Book canon, which is first noted in the sixth/twelfth century, incorporates the Jami' of al-Tirmidhi (d. 279/892). Finally the Six Book canon, which hails from the same period, adds either the Sunan of Ibn Majah (d. 273/887), the Sunan of al-Daraqutni (d. 385/995) or the Muwatta' of Malik b. Anas (d. 179/796). Later hadith compendia often included other collections as well.' None of these books, however, has enjoyed the esteem of al-Bukhari's and Muslim's works.\\" Introduction Abu Dawood compiled twenty-one books related to Hadith and preferred those ahadith which were supported by the example of the companions of Muhammad. As for the contradictory ahadith, he states under the heading of 'Meat acquired by hunting for a pilgrim': \\"if there are two contradictory reports from the Prophet (SAW), an investigation should be made to establish what his companions have adopted\\". He wrote in his letter to the people of Mecca \\"I have disclosed wherever there was too much weakness in regard to any tradition in my collection. But if I happen to leave a Hadith without any comment, it should be considered as sound, albeit some of them are more authentic than others\\". Hadith Mursal (a tradition in which a companion is omitted and a successor narrates directly from Muhammad) has also been a matter of discussion among the traditionists. Abu Dawood states in his letter to the people of Mecca: \\"if a Musnad Hadith (uninterrupted tradition) is not contrary to a Mursal or a Musnad Hadith is not found, then the Mursal Hadith will be accepted though it would not be considered as strong as a Muttasil Hadith (uninterrupted chain)\\". The traditions in Sunan Abu Dawood are divided in three categories. The first category consists of those traditions that are mentioned by Bukhari and/or Muslim. The second type of traditions are those which fulfil the conditions of Bukhari or Muslim. At this juncture, it should be remembered that Bukhari said, \\"I only included in my book Sahih Bukhari authentic traditions, and left out many more authentic ones than these to avoid unnecessary length\\". Description Abu Dawood collected 500,000 hadith, but included only 4,800 in this collection. Sunnis regard this collection as fourth in strength of their six major hadith collections. It took Abu Dawod 20 years to collect the hadiths. He made a series of journeys to meet most of the foremost traditionists of his time and acquired from them the most reliable hadiths, quoting sources through which it reached him. Since the author collected hadiths which no one had ever assembled together, his sunan has been accepted as a standard work by scholars from many parts of the Islamic world, especially after Ibn al-Qaisarani's inclusion of it in the formal canonization of the six major collections.Ignác Goldziher, Muslim Studies, vol. 2, pg. 240.

It began operation in 1962. The Ballistic Research Laboratory became a part of the US Army Research Laboratory in 1992. BRLESC was designed primarily for scientific and military tasks requiring high precision and high computational speed, such as ballistics problems, army logistical problems, and weapons systems evaluations. It contained 1727 vacuum tubes and 853 transistors and had a memory of 4096 72-bit words. BRLESC employed punched cards, magnetic tape, and a magnetic drum as input-output devices, which could be operated simultaneously. It was capable of five million (bitwise) operations per second. A fixed-point addition took 5 microseconds, a floating-point addition took 5 to 10 microseconds, a multiplication (fixed- or floating-point) took 25 microseconds, and a division (fixed- or floating-point) took 65 microseconds. (These times are including the memory access time, which was 4-5 microseconds.) BRLESC and its predecessor, ORDVAC, used their own unique notation for hexadecimal numbers. Instead of the sequence A B C D E F universally used today, the digits ten to fifteen were represented by the letters K S N J F L, corresponding to the teletypewriter characters on five-track paper tape. The mnemonic phrase \\"King Size Numbers Just For Laughs\\" was used to remember the letter sequence.

Concept and development The concept of the album Lift came from several meanings, according to guitarist Tyler Burkum. In an interview with Jesus Freak Hideout, Burkum said: :\\"It's kinda like how if you lift God up. But not only God, there are many ways you can take it. Like how God lifts us up. There are many surface-level ways to take it. The whole thing is kinda how when we lift Christ up to people, we don't have to explain what God is. If you just worship Him and just point to God, that's enough. It's weird cause through the record there's this kind of like this underlying feeling of hope on the whole record. And it wasn't even like we tried to do that. It was just kind of there – this hope and a kind of a peace the way God lifts us up. The record is kind of like what happens when you worship. It's not really worship music, but what happens when you worship.\\"Let Audio Adrenaline give you a lift on Jesus Freak Hideout (October 28, 2001) Burkum also said that the worship nature of most of the songs was not something they planned, but that surged eventually during the writing/recording process. This is also the first album where Burkum and lead singer Mark Stuart share most of the lead vocals. Recording Unlike their previous albums, Lift was not recorded in a traditional studio. The band bought a house in a neighborhood on Nashville, Tennessee, and turned it into a studio. Guitarist Tyler Burkum said in an interview that it was \\"really cool, really fun. That made it for a really low key, low stress atmosphere.\\"Let Audio Adrenaline give you a Lift on Jesus Freak Hideout (10/28/01) Critical reception The album was well received by the audience becoming the second album from Audio Adrenaline to be certified gold by RIAA.

In addition to publishing guidebooks, the company also provides a tailor-made trips service based on customers’ individual criteria. The Rough Guides travel titles cover more than 200 destinations beginning with the 1982 Rough Guide to Greece, a book conceived by Mark Ellingham, who was dissatisfied with the polarisation of existing guidebooks between cost-obsessed student guides and \\"heavyweight cultural tomes\\". Initially aimed at low-budget backpackers, the guidebooks have incorporated more expensive recommendations since the early 1990s, and are now marketed to travellers on all budgets. Since the late 1990s the books have contained colour printing. Much of the books' travel content is also available online. Penguin became responsible for sales and distribution in 1992, acquiring a majority stake in 1996 and buying Rough Guides outright in 2002. In November 2007, after the company had celebrated \\"25 Rough Years\\" with a celebratory series of books, Ellingham left Rough Guides to set up a new green and ethical imprint, GreenProfile, at Profile Books. Rough Guides was run from 2003 until later in the decade by co-founder Martin Dunford (travel) and Andrew Lockett (reference), under the aegis of Penguin before their merger with Random House. In 2017, Rough Guides was sold to APA Publications, parent of Insight Guides. It is now based at APA's offices in Mill Street, Bermondsey, southeast London. The slogan of Rough Guides is \\"Make the Most of Your Time on Earth\\".  Books  Most of the series' early titles were written or edited by John Fisher, Jack Holland and Martin Dunford, who along with Mark Ellingham were co-founders and owners of Rough Guides. In 1995, they negotiated the sale of the series to Penguin Books, a process which was completed in 2002. In 1994, the first non-travel Rough Guides books were published: The Rough Guide to World Music and The Rough Guide to Classical Music. The success of these titles encouraged expansion of the Rough Guides format into other areas of publishing to cover a range of reference subjects, including music – covering genres such as world music, rock, hip-hop, jazz, and individual artists – and topics such as film, literature, popular science, ethical living, true crime, Shakespeare, pregnancy and birth, plus the Internet and related subjects such as eBay, blogging and iPods.  Trips  In November 2018, Rough Guides launched its tailormade trips service. The service offers individualized travel experiences chosen by the traveller, planned by a local expert, and booked by Rough Guides. In keeping with the brand ethos, the trips generally include some sort of adventurous component, dependent on what the traveller has asked for. Digital publishing Rough Guides migrated to digital platforms with the launch of Rough Guides city guides for iOS, Android and Windows platforms, interactive e-books, and downloadable guide chapters. In January 2013 Rough Guides launched a new website. From 1 April 2019, Rough Guides started rolling out a scheme to offer a free downloadable e-book with every print guide purchased. Podcasts Rough Guides runs a podcast called The Rough Guide to Everywhere, which was launched in 2017. The podcast explores topical travel issues and interviews inspirational travel personalities who have unique stories to tell. The first episode went live on 30 January 2017 with the first two series being hosted by Greg Dickinson. On 3 May 2019, Rough Guides announced series 3 and introduced the new hosts, Rebecca Hallett and Neil McQuillian. The first episode of series 4 went live in May 2019 and is hosted by Aimee White. On 9 April 2019, it was announced that The Rough Guide to Everywhere had been nominated for the Best Branded Podcast category at The British Podcast Awards.  Music  In association with UK-based record label World Music Network, Rough Guides has issued over 350 recorded anthologies of the music of various nations and regions. In addition to their \\"Rough Guide\\" Series, the record label World Music Network has released 130 recordings in their other \\"Introducing\\", \\"Riverboat\\", and \\"Think Global\\" Series.  Television  In the late 1980s, the Rough Guides brand was spun off into a series of travel shows on United Kingdom television channel BBC 2. Initially part of Janet Street Porter's DEF II strand, alongside Rapido and Jovanotti's Gimme 5, the show became established in BBC 2's early 1990s evening schedule. Later editions of the show, usually hosted by Sigue Sigue Sputnik associate Magenta Devine (with various male co- presenters through the show's run), were repeated on the Sky Travel channel until 2005. A new Rough Guide series of fifteen thirty-minute programmes started production in November 2007 and began airing on Channel 5 (the UK's fifth terrestrial channel), on 7 January 2008. A second 'Rough Guide to…' series was aired starting in November 2008. Environmental campaigns In May 2007, Mark Ellingham said he had grave concerns about the growth of air travel because of its growing contribution to climate change. He launched a joint awareness campaign with Tony Wheeler (Lonely Planet founder), and Rough Guides began including a \\"health warning\\" in each of its travel guides, urging readers to \\"Fly less, stay longer\\" wherever possible.

It is a primarily residential neighborhood, with a small commercial center near the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue and First Street NW featuring bars, restaurants, and food markets. Most of Bloomingdale's houses are Victorian- style rowhouses built around 1900 as single-family homes. Today, they remain primarily single-family residences, with some recently converted to two-unit condominiums. Geography Bloomingdale is bounded to the north by Channing Street NW, to the east by North Capitol Street, to the south by Florida Avenue NW, and to the west by Second Street NW. The neighborhoods bordering Bloomingdale are LeDroit Park to the west, Shaw to the southwest, Truxton Circle to the south, Eckington to the east, and Stronghold to the northeast. To the north sit the McMillan Sand Filtration Site and the McMillan Reservoir. The neighborhood is a low-lying area, at the foot of hills that extend to the north and east. Its topography is also shaped by the now-buried Tiber Creek, one branch of which generally followed what is now Flagler Place NW. Because of its low-lying topography, flooding periodically occurred in parts of the neighborhood during particularly strong rainstorms. In summer 2012, the stormwater drainage system was overwhelmed multiple times by particularly strong storms, flooding vehicles near the topographic basin at T Street NW and Rhode Island Avenue NW and causing sewer backflow to enter some basements, many of which were rental apartments. Since then, DC Water has undertaken a large-scale tunneling project designed to divert and contain stormwater. Government Bloomingdale is in the southwestern part of Ward 5, currently represented on the City Council by Councilmember Kenyan McDuffie. Bloomingdale is a part of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 5E, currently represented by commissioners Teri Janine Quinn, Bertha Holliday, Horacio Sierra, and Dianne Barnes. History The present-day neighborhood of Bloomingdale originated from several large estates. Located just outside the original boundary of the City of Washington as designed by Pierre L’Enfant in 1792 and in the former County of Washington, the neighborhood known today as Bloomingdale began to develop its residential character in the late 1880s, shortly after the County of Washington was absorbed by the City of Washington and just over a century after L'Enfant's plan was developed. =1792–1870s: farms and estates= The lands that comprise Bloomingdale first began as large estates and orchards. Boundary Street, today Florida Avenue, was the dividing line between paved, planned streets (to the south), laid out in the original L'Enfant Plan, and rural country (to the north of Boundary), where landowners maintained orchards, large country estates and, later, a mixture of commercial properties. In 1823, George Beale and his wife Emily Truxton Beale bought a parcel of land north of the Capitol, along the City boundary, for $600.00 from William Bradley. They named it the \\"Bloomingdale Estate,\\" and it grew to . As late as the 1870s, the land where Bloomingdale now sits was largely a collection of undeveloped private estates and farming properties, most prominently those of the Beales and of the Moores. =1880s onward: residential development= Following Emily Truxton Beale's death in 1885, her heirs began to sell large tracts of the estate to developers. The old Bloomingdale estate rapidly changed into the modern neighborhood configuration as developers and land speculators transformed the undeveloped lands for denser residential development, between the established residential LeDroit Park and Eckington neighborhoods. By 1887, city planners had proposed extending the city's paved street grid into Bloomingdale. 1906 Bloomingdale real estate advertisement In 1891, the Moore farm, north and west of the former Beale estate and representing some of the last undeveloped property in the area, was sold to private developers. It was incorporated into the already-underway Bloomingdale neighborhood. By 1892, the reconfiguration of Bloomingdale was underway, as large estates were consolidated and reconfigured into the predecessor to the modern neighborhood, with further development by 1894. During this time, roads corresponding to the grid system of Washington's streets were improved, curbed, and paved. Streams and creeks were buried or re-directed—most notably the Tiber Creek, many of which had been buried south of Bloomingdale in the original City of Washington. One section of the Tiber Creek in Bloomingdale ran along what is now Flagler Place. Construction on some of the earliest homes was completed between 1892 and 1900. In the early 1900s, the remainder of the surrounding blocks had been built in a speculative nature by such developers as Harry Wardman, Francis Blundon, and S. H. Meyers in the following decade. The neighborhood website contains a list of Bloomingdale's Wardman built homes. Many of Wardman's first homes incorporate elements of Richardson Romanesque architecture (a sub-category of Victorian). This can be seen in the ornate floral and vine-like stone carving around doors and windows of many Bloomingdale homes. His later homes, like those on Adams and Bryant Streets, are in an architectural style for which he is most prominently known, brick homes that incorporate a deeper setback from the street and large covered front porch. Blundon built several homes along 1st Street including 100 W Street, NW, which he occupied with his family. Development continued and, in 1904, the neighborhood's first school, the Nathaniel Parker Gage School, was built on the 2000 block of 2nd Street. (The school has been converted to private condominiums.) By 1909, the old estates had been sold and divided, the Tiber Creek had been buried, and the neighborhood street layout had been fully developed into its present form. Many homes in the northern section of Bloomingdale retain carriage houses in the block interiors. Some have been converted to private residences. =2000–present= Like many D.C. neighborhoods since the early 2000s, Bloomingdale has undergone substantial gentrification, with the neighborhood's once-numerous vacant properties being repurposed, sharp rises in property values, and rapidly shifting demographics. The population is nearly evenly split between White residents, many of whom have moved to the neighborhood since the 2000s, and African American residents, who have historically constituted a majority in the community. During this period of rapid change, new businesses have opened in the neighborhood, primarily restaurants, bars, and food markets. These include Windows Market, Big Bear Cafe, Yoga District, El Camino, Bacio Pizzeria, FieldToCity, Rustik Tavern, Boundary Stone, Aroi Thai Sushi Bar, Grassroots Gourmet, Red Hen, Showtime Lounge, and Crisp Kitchen & Bar. Every summer, the Bloomingdale Farmers' Market operates on Sundays on R St between Florida Ave and 1st Street, N.W. On May 22, 2010, the city officially dedicated a new street, Bloomingdale Court, N.W., the name given by local resident and novelist Frederick Louis Richardson for the alley system between the 100 block of U and V Streets, N.W., and the 2000 block of 1st Street and Flagler Place, N.W. On July 27, 2018, the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board voted to designate Bloomingdale a historic district. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 26 of the same year. The neighborhood has several active neighborhood groups and associations including the Bloomingdale Civic Association. Demographics According to the Census Bureau's 2016 American Community Survey, the population of Bloomingdale's two census tracts was estimated to be about 43% African American, about 42% non-Hispanic White, about 7% Hispanic, and about 3% Asian. Crispus Attucks Park Crispus Attucks Park Bloomingdale has its own community-managed and community-owned greenspace, Crispus Attucks Park. The acre-and-a-quarter park, in the court bounded by First, U, V, and North Capitol streets NW, was previously the site of a warehouse built in 1910 and used as a telephone-switching station and cable yard for the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company.Oman, Anne H. \\"Community Turns Warehouse Into Neighborhood Arts Center\\". The Washington Post. April 6, 1978. p. DC2. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company stopped using the property in 1974 and tried to sell it, but no one wanted to buy it, largely because the only access was by way of an alley off of V Street NW. In 1976, a neighborhood organization, V Street Block Club, approached the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company to donate the property.Kyriakos, Marianne. \\"Bloomingdale's Oasis Rises From the Ashes: Partnership Created to Restore Beloved Crispus Attucks Park\\".

The neighborhood organization asked the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company to use the warehouse to teach children to play music in the warehouse. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company said it would prefer to donate the property to the government of the District of Columbia, which would then donate the property to the neighborhood organization. The District government declined the offer, because it did not have the funds to renovate the building,Von Eckardt, Wolf. \\"Pitching In on a New Park for the Arts: Neighbors Pitching In On a Park for the Arts\\".

In December 1976, Hyman Construction Company learned about the issue, and it agreed to renovate the warehouse, Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company agreed to donate the land and the warehouse to a newly incorporated neighborhood organization, then called NUV-1, an acronym for each street that surrounds the property. Hyman Construction Company paid its employees to renovate the warehouse, and employees of a few other construction companies donated their time as well. National Capital United Presbytery donated $7,500, and architect Ward Bucher donated his time to create the plans. Renovation began in July 1977, and the building officially opened as a neighborhood arts center on April 2, 1978. The neighborhood arts center offered photography, martial arts, and bicycle-repair classes, lectures, musical events, dances, and day-care.Armstrong, Jenice. \\"Center's Hard Times: Some Activists Seek New Leadership\\".

Notable residents and historic landmarks * Since 2018, the Bloomingdale neighborhood as a whole has been a designated historic district, with a period of significance from 1891 to 1948. * Samuel Gompers, the founder of the American Federation of Labor in 1886 (which later became the AFL-CIO), owned and lived in the house at 2122 1st Street, N.W. following its construction in 1900. The house was declared an individual landmark on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. * Chita Rivera, an accomplished and singer, dancer, and entertainer on Broadway. Ms. Rivera lived with her parents (both federal government employees) on the 2100 block of Flagler Place, N.W. until the age of 15. * The Barnett-Aden Gallery, formerly at 127 Randolph Place, N.W., was the first privately owned black gallery in the U.S. and one of Washington, D.C.’s principal art galleries when it opened in 1943. Founded by James V. Herring and Alonzo J. Aden, it was named ‘Barnett-Aden' to honor Aden’s mother’s family. While the owners of the gallery were African American, Barnett-Aden was not conceived as a “black gallery.” It was one of the few art places in the city where artists representing different nationalities, races, and ethnicities were exhibited together. The gallery's collection has since been sold and relocated. * The house at 116 Bryant Street, N.W. was the subject of the Supreme Court case, Hurd v. Hodge. The house was purchased by James M. Hodge and his wife, an African American couple, in violation of a racially restrictive covenant, which the Hodges challenged in court. This case was a companion to Shelley v. Kraemer, which found the enforcement of racial and religious covenants restricting the sale of certain homes to racial and religion minorities to be unconstitutional. Hurd v. Hodge clarified that this ruling applied to the District of Columbia.FindLaw  Cases and Codes * The Nathaniel Parker Gage School on Second Street, N.W. was built as a school in 1904. It is an historic structure, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. The building now houses condominiums.

In November 2005, it was revealed that the Puerto Rico Capitol's surveillance camera system was allegedly misused to blackmail fellow Senator Carlos Díaz, one of the so-called \\"Auténticos\\". McClintock appointed Parga to chair the tripartisan Blue Ribbon Committee looking into the matter. His refusal to cover-up sworn statements suggesting administrative irregularities in the administration of the House of Representatives triggered the New Progressive Party directorate to recommend his expulsion, along with Senate President Kenneth McClintock.Parga a la carga por el video 59 on Primera Hora; Aldridge, Leonardo (September 25, 2006)Vivo el caso del video 59 on Primera Hora; Garzón Fernández, Irene (September 26, 2006) The party recommended the expulsion of the six Senators in March 2006.

After Senator Héctor Martínez resigned the chairmanship of the Senate's Public Safety Committee, Parga was appointed its acting chair by the Senate President. On July 5, 2007, Parga announced that, rather than file for reelection under the PNP banner, he would aspire to become the first independent candidate to win an election to the Senate and put all his Senate leadership positions at McClintock's disposal.Parga anuncia candidatura independiente on Primera Hora (July 5, 2007) The Senate President immediately reiterated his trust in him, although he would no longer appear in the slate of PNP candidates.Intacto el poder del legislador Orlando Parga en el Senado on WAPA-TV (July 5, 2007) In November 2008 he was not reelected while running as an independent.Elecciones Generales 2008: Escrutinio General on CEEPUR (June 15, 2009)  Recent years  Actually, as a political analyst, Parga has not held his punches when commenting on Puerto Rico's status and politics issues.

Plumb has sold more than 500,000 albums and over two million singles worldwide, co-penned songs for numerous other artists, including Michelle Branch, Mandisa, Mandy Moore, Jaci Velasquez, and Natalie Grant, and had music placed in many films and television shows. Originally signed as a Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) recording artist in 1997, Plumb is now known as well as or better in alternative rock, electronic dance music, and for the use of her music in film and television than she is in the CCM market. Origins & Plumb Plumb was born in Indianapolis but grew up in Atlanta, singing in church and school. She moved to Nashville one week before her 21st birthday, where she now resides,https://www.facebook.com/plumbmusic/info/ and worked as a background singer for a number of artists, including Bill Gaither and Amy Grant. Following Silvertone Records affiliate Essential Records mainstream alternative radio success with its debut artist Jars of Clay in 1995, the label signed Plumb as its second artist. When she was urged to write, Plumb turned to Matt Bronlewee—an original member of Jars of Clay who happened to be her next-door neighbor—and the two hit it off. The debut album, Plumb, was released in 1997, with stage name Plumb coming from the Suzanne Vega song \\"My Favorite Plum\\". Plumb has said subsequently that the addition of the letter \\"B\\" to the end was the idea of her producer Matt Bronleewe and, in her mind, also represents Bronleewe's important contribution to her sound. Candycoatedwaterdrops In 1999, Plumb released a second studio album titled Candycoatedwaterdrops, which won the 2000 Gospel Music Association Dove Award for \\"Modern Rock Album of the Year\\". Three tracks from it were later covered by other artists; \\"Stranded\\" and \\"Here With Me\\" by Jennifer Paige and, in 2001, \\"Damaged\\" by Plummet. Though the album won the DOVE Award for Best Modern Rock Album in 2000, and saw strong radio success with the single \\"God- Shaped Hole\\", the subject matter and approach of much of Plumb's music was often considered too dark and taboo for the mainstream Christian marketplace. Plumb's tendency to write songs about deeply personal issues, such as international hit \\"Cut\\" which addressed cutting, and \\"Damaged\\" which addressed a girl coping with being molested as a child, led to more enthusiastic reception by fans of alternative and dance music. Fueling the break from CCM, \\"Cut\\" was also used prominently during a pivotal scene in the storyline of The Vampire Diaries in the 10th episode of season 1, \\"The Turning Point\\". Beautiful Lumps of Coal and Chaotic Resolve Plumb considered leaving the music industry after the 2000 album, but changed her mind after receiving a note from a fan a few hours before what she thought to be her final concert. The letter was about her song \\"Damaged\\" about a girl coping with being molested as a child. The note said \\"Whatever you do, I just want you to never forget that you have changed someone's life,\\" which inspired Plumb to remain in the music industry. She signed to Curb Records in 2003, releasing the album Beautiful Lumps of Coal on March 25, 2003. The lead single, \\"Real\\", peaked at No. 41 in the UK Singles Chart. Her next album, titled Chaotic Resolve, entered the Billboard 200 album chart at No. 177 on March 9, 2006. \\"Better\\" reached No. 1 on the U.S. Christian airplay chart. The Bronleewe & Bose remix of her follow-up, \\"Cut\\", hit No. 1 on SiriusXM's dance hits channel BPM, and No. 5 on Billboard's Dance Charts Hot Dance Club Songs. Blink Shortly after the birth of her second child, Plumb recorded her 5th album, titled Blink, as collection of lullaby inspired songs. It was released on October 9, 2007, immediately becoming one of her best selling and most enduring albums to date. Lead single \\"In My Arms\\", was used in conjunction with key plot narratives for both Vampire Diaries and One Tree Hill, and became Plumb's biggest international hit to date, selling close to half a million singles in both the United States and Russia. \\"In My Arms\\" received remixes by Kaskade, Scotty K, Bronleewe & Bose, Gomi, and Bimbo Jones, with the latter reaching the No. 3 spot on the Billboard Dance Charts. Beautiful History On May 19, 2009, Curb Records announced that it would release a career spanning greatest hits album titled Beautiful History, which was released later in the year and included several new songs. The first single from Beautiful History, \\"Hang On\\", reached No. 1 on US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play in 2009 and reached the top spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in 2010. Need You Now Plumb returned to the studio in 2010 with longtime producer and co-writer Matt Bronleewe to begin work on what would become her 6th studio album, while also changing management and signing with alternative boutique firm Street Talk Media. The debut single from the project, \\"Drifting\\", a co-penned duet with longtime friend Dan Haseltine (of Jars of Clay), spread quickly across Christian Rock radio. The second single, \\"Need You Now (How Many Times)\\", went to CCM radio in early 2012 and has become Plumb's most successful single to date in that market, rising to number to No. 1 on multiple radio and iTunes charts in both the United States and Canada by year's end. The single has remained in regular rotation nationwide for well over a year, selling close to 300,000 singles on iTunes to date, and is BDS certified at over 100,000 radio spins. The album Need You Now was released worldwide in February 2013, charting at a career-best No. 56 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 2 on Christian album charts. The album received five Dove Award nominations including Song of the Year and Contemporary/Pop Album of the Year. With her children now all at least grade school age, and with the massive success of Need You Now, 2012 and 2013 saw the most aggressive touring of her entire career, playing major festivals throughout 2012 and 2013, embarking on her first and largely sold-out headlining tour in the fall of 2013, and joining the massive Winterjam arena tour for November 2013-14. Exhale Plumb released her seventh studio album, Exhale, on May 4, 2015. God Help Me and Beautifully Broken Plumb performing at Lifest 2017 Plumb left Curb Records in early 2017 to form her own label, Plumb Music, and released her first single \\"God Help Me\\" in July 2017. The song was one of six tracks included on the EP God Help Me in late 2017. She followed it up with the album Beautifully Broken in June 2018 on Centricity Music. Paul van Dyk collaboration Following the No. 1 chart successes of \\"In My Arms\\", \\"Hang On\\", and \\"Cut\\", Plumb has been increasingly sought-after in the dance and electronic world. In 2011, she collaborated with trance DJ Paul Van Dyk on \\"I Don't Deserve You\\", playing several shows with Van Dyk, and filming a music video together in middle Tennessee. Plumb's original version and recording of the song would be included on her sixth studio album, Need You Now, and featured in episode 5x02 of Vampire Diaries.

Built as the first 'Northern' type steam locomotive for the Santa Fe, the 3751 served in passenger duties until being retired in 1957. The locomotive was then placed on display in San Bernardino, California until it was restored to operating condition in 1991. The 3751 is currently located in the Central City East neighborhood of Los Angeles and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today, Santa Fe 3751 holds the distinction of being the oldest surviving 4-8-4 type steam locomotive in the world. The locomotive is currently owned and operated by the San Bernardino Railroad Historical Society who use the locomotive to haul occasional mainline excursion trains. However, a federally mandated 15-year inspection was expected to put it out of service for three to four years. 3751's current overhaul is estimated to be completed sometime in 2020.  History  Built in 1927 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, 3751 was Baldwin's and the Santa Fe Railway's first 4-8-4. It had a Santa Fe 5-chime whistle (believed to be the LFM model LM-191 passenger whistle) mounted on it. Tests showed that 3751 was 20% more efficient and powerful than the Santa Fe's 3700 class 4-8-2 \\"Mountain\\" type steamers, which at the time were Santa Fe's most advanced steam locomotives. In 1936, the engine was converted to burn oil. Two years later, the locomotive was given a larger tender able to hold of water and of fuel oil. 3751 was also present at the grand opening of Union Station in Los Angeles on May 7, 1939, pulling the Scout, one of Santa Fe's crack passenger trains as it arrived from Chicago. It was the first steam locomotive to bring a passenger train into LAUPT. In 1941, along with other 4-8-4s, 3751 received major upgrades including: drive wheels, a new frame, roller bearings all around, and more. It is speculated that 3751's (as well as most, if not all, engines of the 3751 class) LM-191 whistle was swapped out for the shorter, much higher pitched LM-192 whistle—either during the rebuild, or soon thereafter. (More on that below, in the ‘Mainline Excursion Career’ section) That same year, it achieved its highest recorded speed at . It continued to be a very reliable working locomotive until 1953, when it pulled the last regularly scheduled steam-powered passenger train on the Santa Fe to run between Los Angeles and San Diego on August 25; this was its last run in revenue service. After that, it was stored at the Redondo Junction roundhouse in Los Angeles for four years before it was officially retired from the roster by the railroad in 1957, and in 1958, it was placed on display in San Bernardino, California. =Restoration= In 1981, the San Bernardino Railroad Historical Society was formed with intentions of restoring and operating 3751. Four years later, they achieved their goal when 3751 was sold to them for one cent with the condition that the SBRHS must restore and operate the locomotive. In 1986, 3751 was moved from its display to California Steel Industries, where it was restored at a cost of $1.50. On August 13, 1991, it moved under its own steam for the first time in 38 years. It made its first excursion run on December 27, 1991, running with two Santa Fe FP45s and 16 passenger cars on a four-day trip from Los Angeles to Bakersfield. Since then, it has been utilized for a large number of excursions and special trips as well as being on display at many events. Ever since it was restored in 1991, the 3751 is now one of the most well-known steam locomotives in North America that still operates to this day. =Mainline Excursion career= The locomotive is currently owned by the San Bernardino Railroad Historical Society, the same organization that performed the initial 1986 restoration. In August 1992, the 3751 was found on its largest assignment so far, as the engine ran the entire route of Santa Fe's Transcon route between Los Angeles and Chicago with three and later two Santa Fe C40-8Ws. The engine spent 18 days traveling over in both directions. ATSF 3751, on its first trip after restoration, leads a train eastbound through alt=ATSF 3751, on its first trip after restoration, leads a train eastbound through Cajon Pass. On April 22–23, 1995, 3751 was displayed in the Riverside Sunkist Orange Blossom Festival in Riverside, CA. On September 22, 1995 when Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe merged with Burlington Northern Railroad to form Burlington Northern Santa Fe with the same number. The excursion happened again on April 20–21, 1996. Also on April 22, 1995, the engine's 5-chime freight whistle (the aforementioned LM-192, made by the Locomotive Finished Material Company—or LFM—of Atchison, KS) was replaced with a new long bell Santa Fe 6-chime whistle (The LM-540, also made by LFM). This particular whistle design was intended to be the standard whistle on all late Santa Fe steam power from about mid-1931 on — including the 3400 class 4-6-2s, all 4-6-4s, the 3765, 3776, and 2900 class 4-8-4s, and all 2-10-4s, as well as many others. Though most, if not all, of the original 3751 class (14 locomotives in all), retained their 5-chime whistles due to apparent height clearance issues in some passenger train terminals. Namely the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, or LAUPT. To this day, the big 6-chime (believed to have come off of a 2900 class 4-8-4) has been the mainstay on 3751. In June 1999, the locomotive participated in Railfair 99. On the way to the fair, 3751 ran with a BNSF C44-9W and a passenger train mixed with a boxcar train. In October 2000, 3751 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A second locomotive of the same class has also been preserved, Santa Fe 3759 in Kingman, Arizona. It too is listed on the NRHP. The locomotive has been displayed at Fullerton Railroad Days in Fullerton, California a number of times. In August 2002, the 3751 ran an Amtrak excursion from Los Angeles to Williams, Arizona to participate in the 2002 National Railway Historical Society Convention. The excursion ran over Metrolink, BNSF Railway, and Arizona and California Railroad tracks. The engine also ran on the Grand Canyon Railway for an excursion on the former Santa Fe's \\"Grand Canyon\\" line. The event including double and tripleheading with Grand Canyon Railway's own steam engines. In 2008, 3751 ran on the Surfline route for two excursions from Los Angeles to San Diego. The first, on June 1, was a public excursion which left 30 minutes late due to a delayed Metrolink train and arrived in San Diego 2 hours behind schedule, mostly caused by the single-track railroad south of Mission Viejo station. The excursion made the locomotive the first steam locomotive to run on the Surf Line since the 1976 American Freedom Train, it was also the first steam powered passenger train to make the run between Los Angeles and San Diego since 3751 last traveled the line in 1953. The train was turned at Miramar Wye, 15 miles north of San Diego station. The second excursion was a private car special on September 21. However, a trespasser was struck near Mission Viejo, delaying all trains up to 3 hours. The excursion passed the cleared location at around 9:00 pm. In May 2010, the locomotive returned to the Surf Line for a third excursion from Los Angeles to San Diego, pulling eight Amtrak cars and a few dome cars, attracting large crowds. In order to alleviate issues with turning the train, the excursion was split over two days: south to San Diego on May 1, and north to Los Angeles the following day. This proved successful, as 3751 was on time into San Diego the first day and sustained only normal delays northbound, thus proving the excursion to be the most successful yet. The weekend after the trip to San Diego had the engine in San Bernardino for \\"National Train Day\\" as well as the 2010 San Bernardino Railroad Days festival. It made an annual run to San Bernardino for the Railroad Days Festival in April or May since the initial trip. No. 3751 with Grand Canyon Railway No. 4960 in 2012. In May 2012, 3751 powered a six-day excursion from Los Angeles to Williams, Arizona to celebrate the state's Centennial. As part of the excursion a special roundtrip doubleheader to the Grand Canyon and back was run with 3751 and Grand Canyon Railway's former Chicago Burlington and Quincy 2-8-2 Mikado 4960. The train also operated over the Arizona and California Railroad on the way to Williams and on the return trip to Los Angeles. Three weeks before the trip to Arizona the engine also made the trip east to attend the San Bernardino Railroad Days Festival for the third year in a row. In May 2013, 3751 ran on a fourth trip to the San Bernardino Railroad Days Festival. In May 2015, 3751 made an appearance at Fullerton Railroad Days 2015 in Fullerton, California, making it the first time since 2008 to appear at this event. From April 31 - May 1, 2016, the loco was on display again and left Fullerton 2 hours late due to traffic. From May 6–7, 2017, she was on display yet again for the last time for a few years as she will be going into a 3-4 year restoration. She will be on display at Union Station's Summer Train Fest on July 15, 2017 before being overhauled. 3751's overhaul is currently estimated to be completed sometime in 2020.

Originally, he was a member of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) but became an independent representative in 2001 after inner disputes with his party. In 2002, he became a member of the New Progressive Party (PNP) and was elected Senator in 2004 and 2008, despite inner struggles within the party and legal issues. In 2008, De Castro Font was arrested by the FBI and subsequently charged with 21 counts of fraud and conspiracy. As a result, he was sentenced to 5 years in federal prison and 3 years probation. Early life and studies Jorge de Castro Font was born in San Juan, on September 10, 1963 to former Puerto Rico Ombudsman Rafael Adolfo de Castro Campos and María Eugenia Font González. He is the grandson of Jorge Font Saldaña, one of former Gov. Luis Muñoz Marín's closest associates. De Castro Font received his Bachelor's degree in Justice System from the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón in San Juan and his Master's degree in History from the Puerto Rico and Caribbean Center for Advanced Studies in Old San Juan. De Castro Font was also a member of the United States Army Reserve, and served briefly with the Puerto Rico National Guard. De Castro Font started distinguishing himself as a youth leader for the Popular Democratic Party. In 1985, he was the assistant of then-Speaker of the House of Representatives, José Ronaldo Jarabo. Career as representative: 1988-2004 De Castro Font decided to run for an elective post in 1988. He was elected to the Puerto Rico House of Representatives in the 1988 general elections. He was 25 at the time, making him the youngest elected representative to that date.FBI arresta senador puertorriqueño acusado de 32 casos de corrupción on DiarioLibre, from EFE; (October 2, 2008)Acusación a De Castro mancha larga trayectoria on El Nuevo Día (October 2, 2008) He was reelected to the post in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 general elections. =Independent legislator in 2001= In August 2001, following internal disputes within the PPD, De Castro Font left the party to become an independent representative. There are several versions of the nature and manner of him leaving the party. While De Castro states that he willfully left the party, others suggest he was forced out. On September 27, 2002, De Castro Font announced he was joining the ranks of the New Progressive Party (PNP) and announced his candidacy for a Senate position. Career as Senator: 2004-2008 De Castro Font went on to win the party primaries and eventually the Senate seat in the 2004 general elections. The elections resulted in a \\"mixed\\" government with PPD's Aníbal Acevedo Vilá as governor, and the PNP dominating both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The PNP majority caucus elected De Castro Font on November 4, 2004 as the Majority Leader of the newly elected Senate, while his friend Kenneth McClintock was elected President of the Senate. =First PNP expulsion: 2005 (\\"Los Auténticos\\")= In early 2005, after his narrow defeat in the 2004 gubernatorial race, former governor Pedro Rosselló announced he was aspiring for a Senate seat vacated by a freshman Senator for the district of Arecibo. After joining the Senate, he expressed his hopes of becoming president of the Senate, and asked his fellow party Senators to support him over President Kenneth McClintock. However, six Senators, including De Castro Font, refused to do so and continued supporting McClintock. This prompted the PNP Board to expel several of these Senators, including De Castro Font, while suspending others. De Castro Font gave up his post as the Senate Majority Leader (which went to Senator Margarita Nolasco), but retained the chairmanship of the Senate Rules Committee, which allowed him to direct all floor activities in the Senate. As a result of the split within the party, McClintock appointed De Castro Font as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Municipal and Financial Affairs Committee, and co-chair of the Joint Select Committee on the Civil Code and the Joint Select Committee on the Penal Code. De Castro did not recognize the party's decision to expel him and continued to identify himself both as a supporter of statehood for Puerto Rico as well as a member of the PNP. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, in the case McClintock vs. Rivera Schatz, annulled De Castro Font's expulsion from the party in a 5-1 decision. In a subsequent case, De Castro Font vs Partido Nuevo Progresista, the Court confirmed his right to appear in the NPP primary ballot. =Second PNP expulsion: 2008 (Legal troubles)= De Castro Font was again nominated on March 9, 2008 in the PNP primary by voters. On July 8, 2008, it was reported that De Castro Font was under investigation for fraud and corruption by the FBI, which was based on testimony by witnesses interviewed regarding a second case. The pro-statehood senator responded saying that he \\"has never received money in exchange for a favor\\". On August 23, 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the Senator's Capitol office, a San Juan, Puerto Rico gas station at which he was a client and his Hato Rey apartment after obtaining a search warrant from U.S. District Court Judge Francisco Besosa. On August 25, Federal agents visited the homes of some of his employees. On that date, he ceased to be the Senate Majority Leader. The search warrants confirmed the rumor of an ongoing investigation from the FBI against De Castro Font. These events were considered by the PNP's President and candidate for Governor, Luis Fortuño, as sufficient cause to seek his disqualification as a candidate for reelection to the Senate. To this, Senator De Castro Font responded aggressively and threatened to reveal information that could link many members of the party in illicit activities, including Fortuño and his wife. On September 9, 2008, De Castro Font voluntarily arrived at the Federico Degetau Federal Building in San Juan to \\"turn himself in\\" after allegedly receiving a phone call that morning from a close friend of Fortuño's, advising him that he was to be arrested that day. The Senator opted to show up at court, rather than be publicly arrested. It is believed that after this event, the Senator and the FBI reached an agreement to allow the Senator to turn himself in voluntarily if there was ever a warrant for his arrest. On September 10, 2008, San Juan District Court rejected the pleas of the PNP to expel Jorge De Castro Font from the ballot for the upcoming elections. The judge determined that once a candidate has been elected in a primary by the people and has been officially certified by the Comisión Estatal de Eleciones, \\"he or she cannot be removed for reasons other than those specified by law\\". Puerto Rico electoral law states that a candidate may only be disqualified if he or she violates state or federal law, violations of internal Party policies are not sufficient cause. Arrest On October 2, 2008, De Castro Font was arrested by the FBI at his lawyer's office in San Juan, Puerto Rico. De Castro Font was arrested and indicted on 32 federal charges including fraud, extortion, bribery and money laundering. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. His political consultant and aide, Alberto Goachet, 67, was also indicted for honest services fraud and extortion. The case is prosecuted by the Criminal Division's Public Integrity Section headed by Chief William M. Welch II, and investigated by the FBI's San Juan Field Office. On that date, Senate President Kenneth McClintock immediately removed him as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, appointing Senate Majority Leader Margarita Nolasco to fill the vacancy. De Castro subsequently lashed out against McClintock for being a \\"traitor\\" to him. Surprisingly, De Castro Font won a slot in the PNP ballot at the PNP primaries,Primarias 2008 on CEEPUR and on the 2008 general elections held on November 4, he was reelected as Senator despite his legal troubles. On December 4, 2008, de Castro was arrested and jailed indefinitely for violating his bail conditions when, according to Federal District Court Judge Francisco Besosa he has at least three improper contacts with government witnesses. During several instances while awaiting trial, he was housed in the Federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Carcel Federal de Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. On December 21, 2008, in a letter to PNP President and Governor-elect Luis Fortuño, he announced that he was resigning the seat to which he was elected in the upcoming Senate scheduled to take office on January 2, 2009. De Castro Font was sentenced on May 17, 2011, to 5 years in prison and 3 years probation. He awaits trial in local courts for related local corruption and tax evasion charges.One of the prisoners De Castro Font met while in jail was Alex Trujillo, a notorious former drug dealer who claimed to have become a christian. The two became friends and began to meet nightly for prayers.https://www.primerahora.com/noticias/policia-tribunales/notas/alex- trujillo-de-ganster-a-predicador/ Personal life Jorge de Castro Font married Jessica Fernández in the 90s. They had three children: Andrea Victoria, Jorge Adolfo, and Sofía María. In recent years, De Castro married attorney Lisandra Delgado. In the midst of his trial, they were divorced. This caused De Castro Font to be taken to a psychiatric hospital due to the stress of the two legal proceedings against him. He was released a few days after to favor home treatment. Later that year, he attempted suicide. Delgado also claimed that she was victim of stalking by the former senator. In 2011, as a result of De Castro's legal troubles and incarceration, it was speculated that his ex-wife, Lisandra, could either be charged with him locally for tax evasion, or serve as a witness against her ex-husband.Causa para arresto contra De Castro Font y su esposa on El Vocero; Del Toro Cordero, Jackeline (June 2, 2011) In 2020, he made news for a minor car accident.

In English, the title is also translated as \\"The Regions of the World\\" following Vladimir Minorsky's 1937 translation, in which he commented on the title as follows: \\"The word ḥudūd (properly 'boundaries') in our case evidently refers to the 'regions within definite boundaries' into which the world is divided in the Ḥ.-'Ā., the author indicating with special care the frontiers of each one of these areas, v.i., p. 30.

The anonymous author reports about different countries (nāḥiyat), people, languages, clothing, food, religion, local products, towns and cities, rivers, seas, lakes, islands, the steppe, deserts, topography, politics and dynasties, as well as trade. The inhabited world is divided in Asia, Europe and \\"Libya\\" (i.e. the Maghreb). The author counts a total of 45 different countries north of the equator.

The Act became law in 1932. The theory behind the Lindbergh Law was that federal law enforcement intervention was necessary because state and local law enforcement officers could not effectively pursue kidnappers across state lines. Since federal law enforcement, such as FBI agents and U.S. Marshals, have national law enforcement authority, Congress believed they could do a much more effective job of dealing with kidnappings than could state, county, and local authorities.Theoharis, Athan G.

Several states implemented their own versions of this law, known as \\"Little Lindbergh\\" laws, covering acts of kidnapping that did not cross state lines. In some states, if the victim was physically harmed in any manner, the crime qualified for capital punishment. This was what occurred in the Caryl Chessman case in California.

The band was formed in 1976, released its only album in 1977 and broke up in 1978. History After Deep Purple broke up in 1976, drummer Ian Paice and keyboard player Jon Lord created a new band, Paice Ashton Lord, with friend Tony Ashton, a British keyboardist and singer of Ashton, Gardner and Dyke. After extensive auditions they chose Bernie Marsden to play electric guitar and Paul Martinez as the band's bassist. Tony Ashton had previously played with Lord on the 1974 album First of the Big Bands and on Lord's Gemini Suite project in 1971, singing lead vocals on one track. He collaborated on Lord's solo work and Deep Purple bassist Roger Glover's solo projects. Soon after Ashton broke his leg falling off a stage in the dark at a London concert, the group was wound up. Lord, Marsden and later Paice joined David Coverdale's Whitesnake. Martinez joined Stan Webb's Chicken Shack for a short time, before joining John Otway for one album, and going on to play with Robert Plant. Later on, Paice played in Gary Moore's band before he and Lord joined the re-formed Deep Purple in 1984. Tony Ashton died of cancer on 28 May 2001, as did Jon Lord, of pancreatic cancer, on 16 July 2012. A memorial concert was held for Tony Ashton at the Buxton Opera House on 4 November 2001. Recordings The band recorded their debut album Malice in Wonderland at Musicland Studios in Munich in September and October 1976. The record was released in February 1977. The music included elements of rhythm and blues, funk and soul, with several tracks featuring a brass section and backing vocals from Sheila and Jeanette McKinley. Despite some critical appreciation, the album was not a great commercial success. A second album was planned but was not released. Film of the band recording the album in the studio was later released as Lifespan. The band appeared on the BBC2 & BBC Radio 1 simulcast series \\"Sight And Sound: In Concert\\", in 1977, performing songs from \\"Malice In Wonderland\\", plus \\"The Ballad Of Mr. Giver\\", from Ashton & Lord's 1974 album, First of the Big Bands.

In 2015, Soren's exhibition Fantasy Life debuted at the Kopeikin Gallery in Los Angeles and traveled to the San Francisco Bay Area. The exhibition showcased images of 21 baseball players selected for the Oakland A's 2002 draft class, whom Soren followed for thirteen years until they were out of baseball. Later that same year, Soren exhibited Panic Beach, a photographic series of rugged, powerful waves along coastlines all over the world. In 2017, the Aperture Foundation published a selection of Soren's Fantasy Life photographs, with text by Dave Eggers. The book was released just prior to a major exhibition at San Francisco City Hall also titled Fantasy Life, which displayed over 180 of Soren's images. Also in summer of 2017, EUQINOMprojects in San Francisco exhibited work from the Surface Tension series, in which all images were photographed using 8 x 10 sheets of film. The gallery also showcases photographs from her project, As Far As You Know. Personal life Soren married author Michael Lewis in 1997. They have three children: Quinn, Dixie, and Walker.

The telephone numbering plan for the country is known as the National Numbering Plan. It is part of a system used for assigning telephone numbers in Trinidad and Tobago, and functions as a part of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). It is regulated by the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago, which holds responsibility for telecommunications in the country. Due to a long established affiliation with NANP, phone numbers in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago are often styled as \\"(868) NXX-xxxx\\". However, the International Telecommunications Union's standards such as E.164 and E.123 both strongly advocate the inclusion of a \\"+1\\" prefix to indicate \\"868\\" is a part of the NANP. History Area code 868 (\\"TNT\\") was created during a split from the original Area code 809 with permissive dialing beginning 1 June 1997. With the end of permissive dialing on 31 May 1998, all calls placed to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago required the use of the +1 868 prefix. Dialing to Trinidad and Tobago *; From within North America (NANP) When calling Trinidad and Tobago from elsewhere in the North American Numbering Plan (e.g., from the United States or Canada), callers dial as if undertaking regular ten- digit dialing within those countries. Callers must simply dial 1 + 868 + seven digit phone number. *; From outside NANP When calling to Trinidad and Tobago from outside the NANP (e.g., from the United Kingdom), callers must dial their international dialing prefix followed by 1 to access the North American Numbering Plan. For example, a call placed from the United Kingdom would be dialled as 00 + 1 + 868 + local seven digit phone number.  Dialing within Trinidad and Tobago  When placing a phone call from Trinidad and Tobago, also known as HNPA (home numbering plan area) dialing, callers simply use seven-digit dialing (i.e. dialing the last seven digits of the phone number). *;To North America (NANP) When calling other places in the North American Numbering Plan, callers dial as if undertaking regular ten-digit dialing in those countries. Callers dial 1 + NPA area code + seven digit phone number. Though usually toll-free when dialed from the US, not all 1-800 phone numbers are toll-free when dialed from Trinidad and Tobago, and may be treated as a toll call. *;To areas outside the NANP When calling to areas outside the NANP (e.g., the United Kingdom), callers dial 011 + country calling code + phone number.

It is free software under GNU GPL license.  Scripting video editor  AviSynth acts as a non-linear video editor controlled entirely by scripting (without a GUI). It emulates an AVI video file (or WAV audio file) as seen by the VFW downstream application, which is typically a media player, video editing software, or an encoder. AviSynth is built upon filters, which are much like DirectShow filters, but with a different binary interface. Filter capabilities include cropping, deinterlacing, inverse telecine, working with still images, doing basic color grading, reducing video noise, and many other things. AviSynth also performs traditional video editing tasks like cutting, trimming and re-sequencing segments. For example, consider the script \\"myAvi.avs\\" (just a plain text-file saved with the extension \\"avs\\") AviSource(\\"myAvi.avi\\") Crop(0, 0, 320, 240) Blur(0.1) This script file can be opened in most media players (such as Windows Media Player). The program will play the video file \\"myAvi.avi\\" cropped down to its top-left 320 pixels by 240 pixels and blurred by a small amount. Operations occur in sequential order, so the cropping occurs first, then the blurring. Technically, AviSynth constructs a filter graph (like Microsoft GraphEdit but with added capabilities), controlled by scripts written in the AviSynth scripting language. Its functionality can be extended through the use of third-party filters known as plugins. An external plugin list is maintained at AviSynth Filter Collection. AviSynth is a frameserver - the calling program requests audio/video frames and the script serves them. The calling program can call frames in any order, allowing it to pause, jump forward or backward etc., just as with a physical file. AviSynth scripting language The scripting language is a dataflow language: a programming paradigm that describes a directed graph of the data flowing between operations. It lacks most procedural programming control structures, but containing many features familiar to programmers, including variables, distinct datatypes, conditionals, and complex expressions. The language works primarily with the audio/video clip as a built-in data type. The clip is a complex structure with many attributes such as width, height and duration. The language also has several other more standard data types: int, float, bool and string. These can be used to perform calculations, decisions, and write text such as subtitles to the video. The script has a single return value, which is the audio and video 'seen' by the program running the script. This is normally the last line of the script, but a return statement may be inserted at any point. =\\"Hello World\\"= This example is a \\"Hello World\\" program. BlankClip() Subtitle(\\"Hello, world!\\") If the above text is entered into a text file with the .avs extension, it can be opened in Windows Media Player or any of the other programs in the list below, and a video containing the words \\"Hello, world!\\" will be displayed. The function creates a new video. The parentheses at the end of the word are optional, since no arguments are being passed, but are given in this case to indicate it is a function and not a variable. The function draws the words \\"Hello, world!\\" on top of the previously-created blank video. Although both functions both accept many more arguments (for example, controlling the size and length of the blank video, and the positioning, font, and color of the subtitle), this example leaves them out; the functions use built-in default arguments. Avisynth uses syntactic sugar that makes simple scripts far easier to write: an implicit variable called . Without implicit variables, the above script would have to be written like this: Last = BlankClip() Last = Last.Subtitle(\\"Hello, world!\\") return Last or like this: A = BlankClip() B = A.Subtitle(\\"Hello, world!\\") return B Explicit clip variables are normally only used for functions involving more than one clip: A = BlankClip() B = A.Subtitle(\\"Hello, world!\\") return Dissolve(A, B, 30) # 30-frame cross fade =Video-processing= This example takes an actual video, applies some simple processing, and returns it to the output. AviSource(\\"C:\\\\Example.avi\\") ReduceBy2() GreyScale() The function is used to load an AVI video from a real location. To open other media types, the function could be used instead. divides the vertical and horizontal size of the video in half, and removes all color information. AviSynth filters work in many RGB and YUV color spaces to allow all kinds of video input and output. Certain functions only work on specific color spaces, requiring conversion - for example, most videos are distributed in a YUV color space, but most color correction is done in one of the RGB spaces. A color- correcting script might look like this: DirectShowSource(\\"movie.mp4\\") # YV12 color space ConvertToRGB32 RGBAdjust(1.0, 0.95, 1.0) # decrease Green channel ConvertToYV12 =User defined= The AviSynth scripting language allows for users to define their own functions. This is an example of a function that allows you to dissolve from one clip to another without damaging interlacing lines. clip1 = AVISource(\\"video1.avi\\") clip2 = AVISource(\\"video2.avi\\") # call the user-defined function which is defined below: interlaced_dissolve(clip1, clip2, 30) # ...the script returns the above result to the calling program # user-defined function: # dissolve from clip1 to clip2 over 30 frames function interlaced_dissolve(clip clip1, clip clip2, int iter) { clip1 = clip1.SeparateFields evn1 = clip1.SelectEven odd1 = clip1.SelectOdd clip2 = clip2.SeparateFields evn2 = clip2.SelectEven odd2 = clip2.SelectOdd evn = Dissolve(evn1, evn2, iter) odd = Dissolve(odd1, odd2, iter) Interleave(evn, odd).Weave.DoubleWeave.SelectOdd # ...the function returns the above result to the main script }  AviSynth 3.0 and AviSynth+  AviSynth 3.0 was a complete rewrite of AviSynth 2.x, and aimed to overcome the limitations of AviSynth 2.x. Adding improvements such as an abstracted color space model, in which new color spaces (including two with 45-bit depth) could be supported through a plug-in mechanism, better cache management for better performance, and using Ruby rather than the homegrown language employed in current versions. AviSynth 3.0 was to be available for other operating systems than Windows, instead relying on GStreamer, extending support to platforms such as Linux, Mac OS X and BSD. Development has been stalled since August 2007. The most current and modern version of AviSynth today is AviSynth+, originally a fork of the official AviSynth 2.xx, but AviSynth+ has since gained widespread recognition and has become the go-to implementation. It rewrote most of the original AviSynth code, and introduced long-sought features such as 64-bit support, multithreading, deep color spaces, support for recent compilers, new scripting constructs (new control-flow constructs such as loops), and increased performance in many areas. At the same time it retained 100% compatibility to the AviSynth 2.5/2.6 series, both for filters and host applications. At the time of writing (2019-05), it is also actively maintained. AviSynth for non- Windows operating systems AviSynth 2.xx may be used under operating systems other than Windows through the use of Wine. To work on scripts VirtualDub/VirtualDubMod can be used as on Windows. To interface between AviSynth under Wine and for example FFmpeg running on a Linux host, Avs2YUV can be used. Avs2YUV is a Windows command line program that is run under Wine and renders the output of an AviSynth script to stdout that is then piped to FFmpeg. Avs2YUV also supports writing to a named pipe.

It was composed in 1919 by Wilfred Pete Maddux (class of 1920) and Mattie Eppes (Boggs). The song is noted for beginning with the opening notes of Reveille — a nod to Tech's past as an all-male military school. Composers Wilfred Preston (\\"Pete\\") Maddux, a trombone and baritone player in the Virginia Tech Regimental Band (member of the band from the Fall of 1917 to 1919), jointly composed \\"Tech Triumph\\" (1985 recording - link updated 2008) in 1919 along with Mattie Walton Eppes (Boggs). Mattie Eppes was a neighbor of Pete in his hometown of Blackstone, Virginia. When he was home, Pete would often play violin with Mattie accompanying him on the piano. One evening in the summer of 1919, Pete asked her to help him compose a fight song for VPI. She played the tune and Pete wrote out the score and the words for two verses in a single evening. Pete Maddux is not listed in the yearbook with the band after 1919. Miss Eppes later married John C. Boggs, Superintendent of Randolph-Macon Military Academy. First performance The song was first performed on Saturday, November 1, 1919, before the football game between V.P.I. and Washington and Lee University. The issue of the university newspaper noted: In a letter to The Virginia Tech published on Dec. 10, 1919, Maddux expressed his appreciation to the student body. ::To the Editor of \\"The Va. Tech,\\" ::Blacksburg, Virginia ::Dear Billy [Virginia Tech editor William Clift] ::May I take this means of asking you to express through the columns of \\"The Tech\\" my sincere appreciation for the generous way in which the Corps received our new song. It is needless to say that the hearty approval of the student body makes me fell highly pleased, for I am quite sure that those who love their Alma Mater are as eager as I am to see the song become more popularly distributed. ::While, of course, every one realizes that I expect to benefit financially through the publication of \\"Tech Triumph\\", I want every body to know that it is mainly my devotion and love to the college, which I am proud to boast as my Alma Mater, that prompted me to write the song and it is for the sake of \\"Tech\\" that I want it to receive a wide circulation. It is more than gratifying to me to see the ardent spirit and loyalty which the Corps manifests when every man lends his lusty voice to swell the chorus of football singing. ::You may be interested to know that the college has approved the song officially and a large number of copies will be sent out by the college to high schools throughout the state as an advertisement of the spirit of \\"Tech.\\" If I will not be presuming too much upon your kindness, may I ask that you help boost the song through \\"The Virginia Tech,\\" and furthermore that you encourage the men of V.P.I. to join us in spreading our song around the country until V.P.I. will be known throughout the South and the country at large. ::Thanking you again for your cooperation in making the publication of \\"Tech Triumph\\" a success, ::I am ::Yours very cordially, ::W.P.

A schematic of a simple 3-inverter ring oscillator whose output frequency is 1/(6×inverter delay). A ring oscillator is a device composed of an odd number of NOT gates in a ring, whose output oscillates between two voltage levels, representing true and false. The NOT gates, or inverters, are attached in a chain and the output of the last inverter is fed back into the first.  Details  Because a single inverter computes the logical NOT of its input, it can be shown that the last output of a chain of an odd number of inverters is the logical NOT of the first input. The final output is asserted a finite amount of time after the first input is asserted and the feedback of the last output to the input causes oscillation. A circular chain composed of an even number of inverters cannot be used as a ring oscillator. The last output in this case is the same as the input. However, this configuration of inverter feedback can be used as a storage element and it is the basic building block of static random access memory or SRAM. The stages of the ring oscillator are often differential stages, that are more immune to external disturbances. This renders available also non-inverting stages. A ring oscillator can be made with a mix of inverting and non-inverting stages, provided the total number of inverting stages is odd. The oscillator period is in all cases equal to twice the sum of the individual delays of all stages. A real ring oscillator only requires power to operate. Above a certain threshold voltage, oscillations begin spontaneously. To increase the frequency of oscillation, two methods are commonly used. Firstly, making the ring from a smaller number of inverters results in a higher frequency of oscillation, with about the same power consumption. Secondly, the applied voltage may be increased. In circuits where this method can be applied, it reduces the propagation delay through the chain of stages, increasing both the frequency of the oscillation and the current consumed. The maximum permissible voltage applied to the circuits limits the speed of a given oscillator. Operation To understand the operation of a ring oscillator, one must first understand gate delay. In a physical device, no gate can switch instantaneously. In a device fabricated with MOSFETs, for example, the gate capacitance must be charged before current can flow between the source and the drain. Thus, the output of every inverter in a ring oscillator changes a finite amount of time after the input has changed. From here, it can be easily seen that adding more inverters to the chain increases the total gate delay, reducing the frequency of oscillation. A transistor level schematic of a three-stage ring oscillator with delay in a .25u CMOS process. The ring oscillator is a member of the class of time delay oscillators. A time-delay oscillator consists of an inverting amplifier with a delay element between the amplifier output and its input. The amplifier must have a gain greater than 1 at the intended oscillation frequency. Consider the initial case where the amplifier input and output voltages are momentarily balanced at a stable point. A small amount of noise can cause the amplifier output to rise slightly. After passing through the time-delay element, this small output voltage change will be presented to the amplifier input. The amplifier has a negative gain of greater than 1, so the output will change in the direction opposite to this input voltage. It will change by an amount larger than the input value, for a gain greater than 1. This amplified and reversed signal propagates from the output through the time-delay and back to the input where it is amplified and inverted again. The result of this sequential loop is a square-wave signal at the amplifier output with the period of each half of the square wave equal to the time delay. The square wave will grow until the amplifier output voltage reaches its limits, where it will stabilize. A more exact analysis will show that the wave that grows from the initial noise may not be square as it grows, but it will become square as the amplifier reaches its output limits. The ring oscillator is a distributed version of the delay oscillator. The ring oscillator uses an odd number of inverters to give the effect of a single inverting amplifier with a gain of greater than one. Rather than having a single delay element, each inverter contributes to the delay of the signal around the ring of inverters, hence the name ring oscillator. Adding pairs of inverters to the ring increases the total delay and thereby decreases the oscillator frequency. Changing the supply voltage changes the delay through each inverter, with higher voltages typically decreasing the delay and increasing the oscillator frequency. Vratislav describes some methods of frequency-stability and power consumption improving of the CMOS ring-oscillator. Vratislav MICHAL. \\"On the Low-power Design, Stability Improvement and Frequency Estimation of the CMOS Ring Oscillator\\". 2012 If 't' represents the time-delay for a single Inverter and 'n' represents the number of Inverters in the Inverter chain, then the frequency of oscillation is given by f = {\\\\frac{1}{2tn} }.Mandal, M.K. & Sarkar, B.C.\\"Ring oscillators: Characteristics and applications\\"  Jitter  Period of ring oscillator vibrates in a random manner T=T+T' where T' is a random value. In high-quality circuits, the range of T' is relatively small compared to T. This variation in oscillator period is called jitter.A Provably Secure True Random Number Generator with Built-in Tolerance to Active Attacks Local temperature effects cause the period of a ring oscillator to wander above and below the long-term average period. Andy Green. Whirlygig GPL Hardware RNG. 2010\\\\. When the local silicon is cold, the propagation delay is slightly shorter, causing the ring oscillator to run at a slightly higher frequency, which eventually raises the local temperature. When the local silicon is hot, the propagation delay is slightly longer, causing the ring oscillator to run at a slightly lower frequency, which eventually lowers the local temperature. So, the frequency of a silicon ring oscillator will generally be stable, when the ambient temperature is constant and factors of heat transfer from the device to the ambient environment do not vary. Note, however, that electronic materials other than silicon may not have the same positive relationship between temperature and propagation delay; if the relationship is negative, the frequency could be unstable (and thermal runaway is even a possibility, in theory).

Political career 1990s = First elected to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Electoral division of Port Darwin as a member of the Country Liberal Party (CLP) in 1990, Stone held several portfolios, including Attorney-General, Education and the Arts, Employment and Training, Mines and Energy, Industries and Development, and Asian Relations and Trade. In late 1997 Stone attracted sustained criticism when as the First Law Officer being the Attorney-General he appointed himself a Queen's Counsel. Stone was the Chief Minister during the referendum for statehood for the Northern Territory in 1998. Electors were asked to vote on whether the Northern Territory should become a state with a constitution that had been approved by a Constitutional Assembly. A bipartisan committee of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly had recommended a constitution and that it should be further considered by an elected Constitutional Assembly. The CLP Government put forward a different constitution to a non-elected Constitutional Assembly. The referendum failed narrowly. The following year Stone resigned as Chief Minister; 18 months later the CLP under Denis Burke lost the next Territory election after 27 years in power. In 1999 he became the federal President of the Liberal Party of Australia, and was appointed a Commander of the Order of Kinabalu by the Malaysian state of Sabah.Stone Family Biography = 2000s = In 2001 he wrote a memo, later leaked to the press, that suggested that the government of John Howard was seen as \\"mean and tricky\\".

The campaign started when the former spanish footballer (soccerplayer) Luis Aragonés, at this time choach of the spanish nationalteam, said these words towards his player and Henrys teammate José Antonio Reyes:\\" You will show this black shi* (Thierry Henry) that you´re better than him\\". That led to Nike creating the \\"Stand up speak up\\" campaign. Together with Nike and other top European players like Rio Ferdinand, Carles Puyol and so on, he protests against this continuing problem inviting football fans to voice their opposition to racism. The symbol of the campaign is two interlocked wristbands, one black, and one white. About 5 million of these wristbands have been sold all over Europe. The wrist bands are no longer being sold and there is no intention to reproduce them, but they are still available on the internet. All the funds raised are passed on to a central Stand Up Speak Up fund that will look to support initiatives that aim to combat racism in football through a variety of programmes and initiatives, that raise awareness, challenge behaviour and strive to change attitudes. This successful campaign included footballers such as Thierry Henry, Rio Ferdinand, Wayne Rooney, Ronaldinho, Cristiano Ronaldo and Adriano. Stand up Speak claimed at the end in 2009 more than 6.5 million US dollars and spent them to 238 projects. Controversy sparked when Gary Neville claimed Nike were only involved for commercial gain and not their anti-racism stance. This carried over into a match against Arsenal as Neville and Manchester United team mate Paul Scholes refused to wear the different anti racism tracksuit top that players from both sides wore.

He was associated mainly with the garage punk genre though he was also influenced by hard rock, blues, country, and folk music. The majority of his recorded output was self-financed and independently released on his own record label. Early career In 1964, Cole began his recording career in Las Vegas with his band, the Lords,Barr, Brian J.

Las Vegas, NV: Tell Records, Mike Tell Productions. 1964. His next single, from 1965, was a promo-only called \\"Poverty Shack\\" b/w \\"Rover,\\" with a band named Deep Soul Cole. The Weeds In 1966 Cole's band The Weeds gained notice in garage rock circles, and their only single, a 1960s punk track called It's Your Time (b/w Little Girl, Teenbeat Club Records), has become a collectors' favorite. The A-side appeared on one of the Nuggets anthologies. The band was promised an opening slot on a Yardbirds bill at the Fillmore in San Francisco, but on their arrival found that the venue hadn't heard of them. Angry at management and fearing the military draft, the band decided to head up to Canada, but ran out of gas in Portland, Oregon. There, they started playing at a club called the Folk Singer, where Kathleen \\"Toody\\" Conner worked. Cole and Toody soon fell in love and were married in 1967, although The Weeds' manager insisted they keep the marriage secret. The Lollipop Shoppe Another manager required The Weeds to change their name to The Lollipop Shoppe because he also managed The Seeds and thought the names were too similar, and to fit the current bubblegum trend (although their 1968 LP on UNI Records (a now-defunct subsidiary of MCA), titled Just Colour, is more a mix of garage rock and the psychedelia of bands such as Love). The album and its single \\"You Must Be a Witch\\" didn't chart, but remain underground favorites. The band also released another single, \\"Someone I Knew\\" b/w \\"Through My Window,\\" played many shows in San Francisco with performers such as Janis Joplin and The Doors, and had two tracks on the soundtrack LP to the film Angels from Hell. The Lollipop Shoppe broke up in 1969, but reappeared as The Weeds with another single in 1971. Whizeagle and Zipper Frustrated with the music business and still of draft age, Cole headed for Alaska with Toody and their two young children. They got as far as the Yukon, where they homesteaded for a year. Upon their return, Cole tried unsuccessfully to secure another record deal in Los Angeles. He settled in Portland and opened a musical equipment store called Captain Whizeagle's. Taking his musical career into his own hands, he formed the hard rock band Zipper and released an LP in 1975 on his and Toody's label, Whizeagle.Mosurock, Doug (2006) \\"Dead Moon Echoes of the Past\\", Dusted magazine, September 7, 2006, retrieved 2010-01-22 King Bee, The Rats, Western Front Cole's next band, King Bee, saw him playing guitar for the first time in addition to singing. A last-minute invitation to open for The Ramones introduced them to the punk sounds of the time. They released the \\"Hot Pistol\\" single on Whizeagle in 1978, but soon broke up. In an attempt to find a stable lineup, Cole taught Toody to play bass and they formed The Rats. Their self-titled debut was released in 1980 on Whizeagle. Intermittent Signals followed in 1981, and 1983 saw the release of the third LP, In a Desperate Red. After losing three drummers, and tired of the macho direction the punk scene had taken, Cole disbanded The Rats and began an old-time country band called Western Front. They released only two singles, \\"Orygun\\" b/w \\"Clementine\\" and \\"Stampede\\" b/w \\"Looking Back at Me\\" in 1985, but they influenced many local punkers to develop an interest in country-rock and rockabilly. The Range Rats and Dead Moon Toody, who had occasionally performed with Western Front and recorded a single with them, rejoined Cole for another country-influenced project, The Range Rats, in 1986. Drummer Andrew Loomis auditioned for this band, but it didn't work out, so Cole and Toody carried on with a drum machine. In 1987, while returning from Reno (their favorite vacation spot), Cole and Toody decided they wanted to play rock 'n' roll again. They called Andrew Loomis, who was a better fit for this project, and Dead Moon was born. Dead Moon's music is a blend of dark '60s garage with punk rock; It was described by Robert Christgau as sounding \\"like the 13th Floor Elevators without the clinical dementia\\".Christgau, Robert (2006) \\"Dead Moon Echoes of the Past Review\\", Rolling Stone, November 30, 2006 (reproduced at his website), retrieved 2010-01-22 Their early records, In the Graveyard, Unknown Passage, and Defiance, appeared on the band's own Tombstone Records, named for the music store Cole and Toody operated in Clackamas, Oregon.

According to David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald (1994, p. 5), the wage curve summarizes the fact that \\"A worker who is employed in an area of high unemployment earns less than an identical individual who works in a region with low joblessness.\\" An explanation for the wage curve One way to understand the wage curve is as follows. The labour supply of each individual is positively correlated to wages, therefore the higher is the hourly wage offered, the more hours an individual is willing to work. However, there is a limit to which every person would be willing to sacrifice an hour of leisure or rest, for an hour's worth of wages. Let's say that X is the maximum number of hours a person can work, and $A is the minimum hourly wage rate he expects in return. Any wage $B, greater than $A, will increase the worker's daily wage without increasing the hours of work. So if you need more hours of work than X, you need to hire more people. Say you need to purchase Y hours of labour from the labour market. Let us assume that Y = 4X. This means that Y is four times as much as one labourer's maximum labour offer. If you pay $A an hour then you can hire 4 labourers to work for X hours each. However, depending on the labour market conditions, other options are open: Say that there are not very many jobs in the labour market, unemployment is high and a lot of people are under-employed (working much fewer than X hours). In this situation the going rate is likely to be lower than $A as it is very unlikely that an employee would be asked to work for X hours. You would save money by hiring more than 4 labourers with each of them working fewer than X hours. Say the labour market is tight and most people are already working X hours a day. It is very hard to find people who are not already earning $A an hour, and because of that you must match the money offer elsewhere in order to get someone to work for you. The wage level in this scenario would be higher than the earlier scenario. In short, the lower unemployment is and the fewer laborers there are available, the higher the wages. The contrary is true when unemployment is high. This is the essence of the wage curve. Implications of wage curve It is utilised to explain why within a country, some regions suffer worse unemployment than others. Labourers could, but, for whatever reasons, are unwilling to migrate from regions with high unemployment, low wage areas to low unemployment, high wage areas. One of the reasons why unemployed labourers would not want to migrate to other areas with plenty of jobs is because of home-ownership. The worker might be deterred from moving because of the costs involved in selling off their home and moving. Blanchflower and Oswald have found that the unemployment rate is positively correlated to home-ownership rate in a cross country study. However recently some micro econometric evidence suggests that the relationship between home- ownership and unemployment is slightly more complicated. People who are employed are more likely to be able to afford a mortgage, and are therefore more likely to have bought their own home. The evidence indicates that the employed home-owners are less likely to become unemployed, and they are also more likely to be employed in jobs with high stability and therefore less likely to change jobs. The unemployed home-owners are more likely to find jobs within the local areas, and less likely to find jobs which would necessitate a move. The overall picture suggests that although home-owners are reluctant to move around, they are more often than not employed, and therefore not contributing to the unemployment rate.

The vast majority of Baháʼís have followed a line of authority from Baháʼu'lláh to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá to Shoghi Effendi to the Custodians to the Universal House of Justice. Sects diverging from this line of leadership have failed to attract a sizeable following. In this sense, there is only one major branch of the Baháʼí Faith,Major Branches of Religions Ranked by Number of Adherents, Adherents.com represented by at least 5 million adherents, whereas the groups that have broken away have either become extinct with time, or have remained very small in number, representing far less than 0.1% of all Baháʼís. Globally the Baháʼí community has maintained its unity. Quote from source: \\"Some attempts were made during the 1950s and 1960s to bring together the disparate groups of Covenant-breakers, but these had little effect. Globally, the Baháʼí community has maintained its unity.\\" Baháʼí scriptures define a Lesser Covenant regarding succession which is intended to keep the Baháʼís unified. Claimants challenging the widely accepted successions of leadership are shunned by the majority group as Covenant- Breakers. A separate entry discusses the Baháʼí/Bábí split. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's ministry Baháʼu'lláh remained in the Akka-Haifa area under house arrest until his death in 1892. According to the terms of his will, his eldest son ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was named the centre of authority; Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí, the eldest son from Baháʼu'lláh's second wife, was assigned a secondary position.Baháʼu'lláh, Tablets of Baháʼu'lláh, p. 221 With ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as the head of the Baháʼí community, soon Muhammad ʻAli started working against his elder brother, at first subtly and then in open opposition. Most members of the families of Baháʼu'lláh's second and third wives supported Muhammad ʻAlí; however, there were very few outside of Haifa who followed him. Muhammad ʻAlí's machinations with the Ottoman authorities resulted in ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's re-arrest and confinement in Acre. They also caused the appointment of two official commissions of inquiry, which almost led to further exile and incarceration of ʻAbdu'l-Baha to North Africa. In the aftermath of the Young Turk revolution, Ottoman prisoners were freed thus ending the danger to ʻAbdu'l-Baha. Meanwhile, Ibrahim George Kheiralla, a Syrian Christian, converted to the Baháʼí Faith, emigrated to the United States and founded the first American Baháʼí community. Initially, he was loyal to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. With time Kheiralla began teaching that ʻAbdu'l-Baha was the return of Christ, and this was becoming the widespread understanding among the Baháʼís in the United States, despite ʻAbdu'l-Baha's efforts to correct the mistake. Later on, Kheiralla switched sides in the conflict between Baháʼu'lláh's sons and supported Mirza Muhammad Ali. He formed the Society of Behaists, a religious denomination promoting Unitarian Bahaism in the U.S., which was later led by Shua Ullah Behai, son of Mirza Muhammad Ali, after he emigrated to the United States in June 1904 at the behest of his father. Muhammad ʻAlí's supporters either called themselves Behaists Shu'a'ullah, Behai Quarterly Volume 4 Page 23 or \\"Unitarian Baháʼís\\".Browne, p. 82. The reference appears to be to the unitarian theology of one god, rather than any identification with the American Unitarian Association. From 1934 to 1937, Behai published Behai Quarterly a Unitarian Bahai magazine written in English and featuring the writings of Muhammad Ali and various other Unitarian Bahais. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's response to determined opposition during his tenure was patterned on Baháʼu'lláh's example and evolved across three stages. Initially, like Baháʼu'lláh, he made no public statements but communicated with his brother Muhammad ʻAlí and his associates directly, or through intermediaries, in seeking reconciliation. When it became clear that reconciliation was not possible, and fearing damage to the community, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá wrote to the Baháʼís explaining the situation, identifying the individuals concerned and instructing the believers to sever all ties with those involved. Finally, he sent representatives to those areas most affected by the problem. The function of these representatives was to explain matters to the Baháʼís and to encourage them to persevere in cutting all contact. Often these chosen individuals would have ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's authority to open up communications with those involved to try to persuade them to return. In Iran, such envoys were principally the four Hands of the Cause appointed by Baháʼu'lláh. =Aftermath= When ʻAbdu'l-Bahá died, his Will and Testament explained in some detail how Muhammad ʻAlí had been unfaithful to the Covenant, identifying him as a Covenant-breaker and appointing Shoghi Effendi as leader of the Faith with the title of Guardian. Baháʼí authors such as Hasan Balyuzi and Adib Taherzadeh set about refuting the claims of Muhammad ʻAlí. This represented what is often described as the most testing time for the Baháʼí Faith. The Behaists rejected the authority of the Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, claiming loyalty to the leadership succession as they inferred it from Baha'u'llah's Kitab-i-Ahd. This schism had very little effect. In the ʻAkká area, the followers of Muhammad ʻAlí represented six families at most, they had no common religious activities, and were almost wholly assimilated into Muslim society. A modern academic observer has reported an attempt to revive the claims of Muhammad Ali in order to lend legitimacy to a newly established sect avowing loyalty to Baháʼu'lláh but rejecting the authority that Baháʼu'lláh gave to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and to the Universal House of Justice. Shoghi Effendi as GuardianAppointment= Shoghi Effendi at the time of becoming Guardian in 1921. Taken in Haifa. At 24, Shoghi Effendi was particularly young when he assumed leadership of the religion in 1921, as provided for by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in his Will and Testament. He had received a Western education at the Syrian Protestant College and later at Balliol College, Oxford. At this time Muhammad-ʻAlí revived his claim to leadership of the Baháʼí community. He seized the keys of the Tomb of Baháʼu'lláh at the mansion of Bahjí, expelled its keeper, and demanded that he be recognized by the authorities as the legal custodian of that property. However, the Palestine authorities, after having conducted some investigations, instructed the British officer in ʻAkká to deliver the keys into the hands of the keeper loyal to Shoghi Effendi.See =American disputes= After the death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, Ruth White questioned the Will's authenticity as early as 1926, and openly opposed Shoghi Effendi's Guardianship, publishing several books on the subject. She wrote a letter to the United States Postmaster General and asked him, among other things, to prohibit the National Spiritual Assembly from \\"using the United States Mails to spread the falsehood that Shoghi Effendi is the successor of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and the Guardian of the Cause.\\" She also wrote a letter to the High Commissioner for Palestine; both of these letters were ignored. Another division occurred primarily within the American Baháʼí community, which increasingly consisted of non-Persians with an interest in alternative spiritual pursuits. Many had been strongly attracted to the personality of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and the spiritual teachings of the Baháʼí Faith. Some regarded it as an ecumenical society to which all persons of goodwill—regardless of religion—might join. When Shoghi Effendi made clear his position that the Baháʼí Faith was an independent religion with its own distinct administration through local and national spiritual assemblies, a few felt that he had overstepped the bounds of his authority. Most prominent among them was a New York group including Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, Lewis and Julia Chanler, who founded the \\"New History Society\\", and its youth section, the Caravan of East and West. Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, The Baháʼí Cause pp. 309-14 Sohrab and the Chanlers refused to be overseen by the New York Spiritual Assembly, and were expelled by Shoghi Effendi as Covenant-breakers. They argued that the expulsion was meaningless because they believed the faith could not be institutionalized. The New History Society published several works by Sohrab and Chanler and others. Sohrab accepted the legitimacy of Shoghi Effendi as Guardian, but was critical of the manner of his leadership and the methods of organizing the Baháʼí administration. The New History Society attracted fewer than a dozen Baháʼís, however its membership swelled to several thousand for a time. The New History Society was active until 1959 and is now defunct. The Caravan House, aka Caravan Institute, later disassociated itself from the Baháʼí Faith, and remained as an unrelated non- profit educational organization.Moojan Momen 2003, § G.2.d.ii See also New York Tax Exempt and NonProfit Organizations All of the divisions of this period were short-lived and restricted in their influence. =Family members expelled= In 1932 Shoghi Effendi's great aunt, Bahiyyih Khanum, died. She was highly respected and had instructed all to follow Shoghi Effendi through several telegrams she had sent around the world announcing the basics of the provisions of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's will and was witness to the actions relatives took in violation of provisions of the will. Bahíyyih Khánum had devoted much of her life towards protecting the accepted leadership of the Baháʼí Faith and after Shoghi Effendi's appointment there was little internal opposition until after her death when nephews began to openly oppose Shoghi Effendi over Baháʼu'lláh's house in Baghdad. Some family members disapproved of his marriage to a Westerner, Mary Maxwell — daughter of one of the foremost disciples of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá — in 1937. They claimed that Shoghi Effendi introduced innovations beyond the Iranian roots of the Faith. This gradually resulted in his siblings and cousins disobeying his instructions and marrying into the families of Covenant-breakers, many of whom were expelled as Covenant-breakers themselves. However, these disagreements within Shoghi Effendi's family resulted in no attempts to create a schism favouring an alternative leader. At the time of his death in 1957, he was the only remaining male member of the family of Baháʼu'lláh who had not been expelled. Even his own parents had openly fought against him. The founding of the Universal House of Justice Shoghi Effendi died in 1957 without explicitly appointing a successor Guardian. He had no children, and during his lifetime all remaining male descendants of Baháʼu'lláh had been excommunicated as Covenant-breakers. He left no will. Shoghi Effendi's appointed Hands of the Cause unanimously voted it was impossible to legitimately recognize and assent to a successor. The Baháʼí community was in a situation not dealt with explicitly in the provisions of the Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. Furthermore, the Universal House of Justice had not yet been elected, which represented the only Baháʼí institution authorized to adjudicate on matters not covered by the religion's three central figures. To understand the transition following the death of Shoghi Effendi in 1957, an explanation of the roles of the Guardian, the Hands of the Cause, and the Universal House of Justice is useful. =Guardianship= 120px Other than allusions in the writings of Baháʼu'lláh to the importance of the Aghsán, the role of the Guardian was not mentioned until the reading of the Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. Shoghi Effendi later expressed to his wife and others that he had no foreknowledge of the existence of the Institution of Guardianship, least of all that he was appointed as Guardian. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá warned the Baháʼís to avoid the problems caused by his half-brother Muhammad ʻAlí. He stipulated the criteria and form for selecting future Guardians, which was to be clear and unambiguous. His will required that the Guardian appoint his successor \\"in his own life-time ... that differences may not arise after his [the Guardian's] passing.\\" The appointee was required to be either the first- born son of the Guardian, or one of the Aghsán (literally: Branches; male descendants of Baháʼu'lláh). Finally, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá left a responsibility of ratifying the appointment to nine Hands of the Cause, elected from all of the Hands. The will also vested authority in the Guardian's appointed assistants, known as the Hands of the Cause, giving them the right to \\"cast out from the congregation of the people of Bahá\\" anyone they deem in opposition to the Guardian. =Relationship between the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice= The roles of the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice are complementary, the former providing authoritative interpretation, and the latter providing flexibility and the authority to adjudicate on \\"questions that are obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book.\\" The authority of the two institutions was elucidated by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in his will, saying that rebellion and disobedience towards either the Guardian or the Universal House of Justice, is rebellion and disobedience towards God. Shoghi Effendi went into further detail explaining this relationship in The World Order of Baháʼu'lláh, indicating that the institutions are interdependent. =Role of the Hands of the Cause= Shortly after Shoghi Effendi's death, the 27 then-living Hands of the Cause (Hands) deliberated over whether or not they could legitimately consent to any successor. Only two members present could translate between English and Persian. Following these events Time Magazine reported that there were debates about two possible candidates for Guardian.Time Magazine Dec. 9, 1957 \\"In the Hands of the Hands\\" On November 25, 1957, the Hands signed a unanimous proclamation stating that he had died \\"without having appointed his successor\\"; that \\"it is now fallen upon us... to preserve the unity, the security and the development of the Baháʼí World Community and all its institutions\\"; and that they would elect from among themselves nine Hands who would \\"exercise ... all such functions, rights and powers in succession to the Guardian of the Baháʼí Faith... as are necessary to serve the interests of the Baháʼí World Faith, and this until such time as the Universal House of Justice... may otherwise determine.\\" This body of nine Hands became known as the Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land, sometimes referred to as the Custodians. That same day the Hands passed a unanimous resolution that clarified who would have authority over various executive areas.For their authority, the Custodians referred to the Will and Testament of ʻAbdul-Bahá which states that \\"the Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own number nine persons that shall at all times be occupied in the important services in the work of the Guardian of the Cause of God.” See: Rabbani, Ministry of the Custodians, 1992, Letter of 28 May 1960, to all National Spiritual Assemblies (pp. 204-206), Letter of 5 July 1960, to all National Spiritual Assemblies (pp. 208-209), Letter of 7 July 1960, to all Hands of the Cause, Cable of 26 July 1960, to all National Spiritual Assemblies (p.223), and Letter of 15 October 1960, to all National Spiritual Assemblies (pp. 231-236) In addition, the Guardian had written that the Hands had executive authority in carrying out his directives. Among these were: *\\"That the entire body of the Hands of the Cause, ... shall determine when and how the International Baháʼí Council shall pass through the successive stages outlined by Shoghi Effendi culminating in the election of the Universal House of Justice\\" *\\"That the authority to expel violators from the Faith shall be vested in the body of nine Hands [The Custodians.], acting on reports and recommendations submitted by Hands from their respective continents.\\" In their deliberations following Shoghi Effendi's passing they determined that they were not in a position to appoint a successor, only to ratify one, so they advised the Baháʼí community that the Universal House of Justice would consider the matter after it was established. In deciding when and how the International Baháʼí Council would develop into the Universal House of Justice, the Hands agreed to carry out Shoghi Effendi's plans for moving it from the appointed council, to an officially recognized Baháʼí Court, to a duly elected body, and then to the elected Universal House of Justice.See and In November 1959, referring to the goal of becoming recognized as a non-Jewish religious court in Israel, they said: \\"this goal, due to the strong trend towards the secularization of Religious Courts in this part of the world, might not be achieved.\\"See The recognition as a religious court was never achieved, and the International Baháʼí Council was reformed in 1961 as an elected body in preparation for forming the Universal House of Justice. The Hands of the Cause made themselves ineligible for election to both the council and the Universal House of Justice. Upon the election of the Universal House of Justice at the culmination of the Ten Year Crusade in 1963, the nine Hands acting as interim head of the religion closed their office. =Charles Mason Remey= Charles Mason Remey was among the Hands who signed the unanimous proclamations in 1957, acknowledging that Shoghi Effendi had died without having appointed his successor. He was also among the nine Custodians initially elected to serve in the Holy Land as interim head of the religion. On 8 April 1960, Remey made a written announcement that he was the second Guardian of the Baháʼí Faith and explained his \\"status for life as commander in chief of Baháʼí affairs of the world\\" in this proclamation which he requested to be read in front of the annual US convention in Wilmette.See Charles Mason Remey, Proclamation to the Baháʼís of the World, p. 1 He based his claim on his having been appointed President of the first International Baháʼí Council by Shoghi Effendi in 1951. The appointed council represented the first international Baháʼí body. Remey believed that his appointment as the council's president meant that he was the Guardian of the Baháʼí Faith.The Hands of the Cause wrote regarding his reasoning on this point, \\"If the President of the International Baháʼí Council is ipso facto the Guardian of the Baháʼí Faith, then the beloved Guardian, himself, Shoghi Effendi would have had to be the President of this first International Baháʼí Council.\\" Regarding the authority of the Hands of the Cause, Remey wrote in his letter that the Hands \\"have no authority vested in themselves... save under the direction of the living Guardian of the Faith.\\"See Charles Mason Remey, Proclamation to the Baháʼís of the World, p. 5 and also \\"Role of the Hands of the Cause\\". He further commanded the Baháʼís to abandon plans for establishing the Universal House of Justice.See Charles Mason Remey, Proclamation to the Baháʼís of the World, pp. 6-7 Remey never addressed the requirement that Guardians should be male-descendants of Baháʼu'lláh, of whom Remey was not. His followers later referred to letters and public statements of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá calling him \\"my son\\" as evidence that he had been implicitly adopted but these claims were almost universally rejected by the body of the Baháʼís. In response, and after having made many prior efforts to convince Remey to withdraw his claim, the Custodians took action and sent a cablegram to the National Spiritual Assemblies on 26 July 1960.See Two days later the Custodians sent Mason Remey a letter informing him of their unanimous decision to declare him a Covenant-breaker. They cited the Will and Testament of ʻAbdul-Bahá, the unanimous joint resolutions of November 25, 1957, and their authority in carrying out the work of the GuardianSee as their justification. Anyone who accepted Remey's claim to the Guardianship was also expelled. Remey attracted about 100 followers in the United States and a few others in Pakistan and Europe. Remey maintained his claim to Guardianship, and went on to establish what came to be known as the Orthodox Baháʼís Under the Hereditary Guardianship, which later broke into several other divisions based on succession disputes within the groups that followed Remey. Although initially disturbing, the mainstream Baháʼís paid little attention to his movement within a few years. As of 2006 his followers represent two or three groups that maintain little contact with each other, comprising a few hundred members collectively. =Decision of the Universal House of Justice= The Baháʼí institutions and believers around the world pledged their loyalty to the Hands of the Cause, who dedicated the next few years to completing Shoghi Effendi's Ten Year Crusade, culminating with the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963. It was at this time the Custodians officially passed their authority as the head of the Faith to the Universal House of Justice, which soon announced that it could not appoint or legislate to make possible the appointment of a second Guardian to succeed Shoghi Effendi. A short time later it elaborated on the situation in which the Guardian would die without being able to appoint a successor, saying that it was an obscure question not covered by Baháʼí scriptures, that no institution or individual at the time could have known the answer, and that it therefore had to be referred to the Universal House of Justice, whose election was confirmed by references in Shoghi Effendi's letters that after 1963 the Baháʼí world would be led by international plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice.The Universal House of Justice, Letter of 9 March 1965, Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1963-1986, p. 50 =A break in the line of Guardians= Mason Remey and his successors asserted that a living Guardian is essential for the Baháʼí community, and that the Baháʼí writings required it. The basis of these claims were almost universally rejected by the body of the Baháʼís, for whom the restoration of scripturally sanctioned leadership of the Universal House of Justice proved more attractive than the claims of Mason Remey. The House commented that its own authority was not dependent on the presence of a Guardian, and that its legislative functioning was unaffected by the absence of a Guardian. It stated that in its legislation it would be able to turn to the mass of interpretation left by Shoghi Effendi. The Universal House of Justice addressed this issue further early after its election clarifying that \\"there is nowhere any promise or guarantee that the line of Guardians would endure forever; on the contrary there are clear indications that the line could be broken.\\"The Universal House of Justice, Letter of 7 December 1969, Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1963-1986, p. 158The Universal House of Justice specifically refers to paragraph 42 of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas as evidence that Baháʼu'lláh anticipated that the line of Guardians was not guaranteed forever by providing for the disposition of the religion's endowments in the absence of the Aghsán. See also Notes 66 and 67 of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, pp. 196-197. Further development of Remey's followers All those that professed belief in Mason Remey as the second Guardian did not accept the Universal House of Justice established in 1963. Among the Baháʼís who accepted Mason Remey as the second Guardian, several further divisions have occurred based on conflicting opinions of legitimacy and succession of authority. They began to split into smaller groups even before his death in 1974. Small Remeyite groups are now largely confined to the United States. Some of these divisions are described below. The Encyclopædia Iranica reports the following: :Remey died in 1974, having appointed a third Guardian, but the number of adherents to the Orthodox faction remains extremely small. Although successful in Pakistan, the Remeyites seem to have attracted no followers in Iran. Other small groups have broken away from the main body from time to time, but none of these has attracted a sizeable following. Remey died at the age of 99 living many of his last years in Florence, Italy. =Under the Hereditary Guardianship= In 1962 Mason Remey asked his supporters in the United States to organize themselves and elect a \\"National Spiritual Assembly Under the Hereditary Guardianship\\" (NSAUHG). The Assembly was incorporated in New Mexico in 1964. In 1964 the NSAUHG filed a lawsuit against the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of the Baháʼís of the United States to receive the legal title to the Baháʼí House of Worship in Illinois, and all other property owned by the NSA. The NSA counter- sued and won.Baháʼís vs New Mexico Group District Court, N.D. Illinois, E. Div. No. 64 C 1878. Decided June 28, 1966 Later that year, Remey asked the NSAUHG to dissolve, as well as the second International Baháʼí Council that he had appointed with Joel Marangella, residing in France, as president. Marangella, Donald Harvey, and Jacques Soghomonian had previously served on the National Spiritual Assembly of France (in 1961) and had been declared Covenant-breakers when they accepted Mason Remey as the next Guardian. After 1966, some followers of Mason Remey began forming their own groups based on different understandings of succession. =Orthodox Baháʼí Faith= Joel Marangella was president of Remey's \\"Second International Baháʼí Council\\", and claimed in 1969 to have been secretly appointed by Remey as Guardian several years earlier. His supporters came to be known as Orthodox Baháʼís. Membership data is scarce. One source estimated them at no more than 100 members in 1988,THE COVENANT, Moojan Momen. Quoting Chicago Tribune, 10 June 1988, section 1, p. 9 and the group claimed a United States membership of about 40 in a 2007 court case., US District Court for Northern District Court of Illinois Eastern Division, Civil Action No. 64 C 1878: Orthodox Baháʼí Respondents' Surreply Memorandum to NSA's Reply Memorandum, p2 para 2 line 15 Websites claiming to represent the Orthodox community indicate followers in the United States and India.The National Baháʼí Council of the Orthodox Baháʼí Faith Joel Marangella died in San Diego, California on Sept 1, 2013. =Baháʼís under the provisions of the covenant= Leland Jensen accepted Remey's claim to the Guardianship and later left the group. In 1969 he was convicted of \\"a lewd and lascivious act\\" for sexually molesting a 15-year-old female patient,State v. Jensen, 153 Mont. 233, 455 P.2d 631 (Montana, 1969) and he served four years of a twenty-year sentence in the Montana State Prison. It was in prison that Jensen converted several inmates to his ideas of being what he called the \\"Establisher\\" of the Baháʼí Faith, stemming from his belief that the Baháʼí administrative order became corrupted. After being paroled in 1973 and before Remey's death, Jensen formed a group called the Baháʼís Under the Provisions of the Covenant. Since the 1970s, Jensen believed Remey's adopted son Joseph Pepe was the Guardian, an idea that Pepe rejected several times. In 1991 Jensen appointed followers to a second International Baháʼí Council (sIBC), intending that it would grow into an elected Universal House of Justice after a nuclear holocaust. Jensen died in 1996. A researcher has noted that since 1980, BUPC membership has never exceeded 200 nationwide,Harvard researchers have noted a community of 30 members in the headquarters of Missoula, Montana in 2003, as well as the existence of BUPC adherents in Denver and Alaska. ()() and declined in size significantly by 1990 and beyond. Adherents were mostly concentrated in Montana. =Jacques Soghomonian= Donald Harvey (d.1991), was appointed by Remey as \\"Third Guardian\\" in 1967. After Harvey's death in 1991, leadership of this group went to Jacques Soghomonian, a resident of Marseilles, France. Soghomonian died in 2013 and passed the successorship to E.S. Yazdani.http://guardianshipofthebahaifaith.org/ridvan/Ridvan%2020%20December%202013%20.pdf =The Remey Society= Francis Spataro of New York City, who supported Donald Harvey's claim as Remey's successor, independently organized \\"The Remey Society\\" after losing favor with Harvey. Spataro published books about Charles Mason Remey,*Spataro, Francis C. (2003). Charles Mason Remey and the Baháʼí Faith, Tover Publications, Queens, NY 11427-2116. 2003 . and at one time had a newsletter with about 400 recipients. When Spataro began to preach that Charles Mason Remey was a \\"Prophet\\", Harvey cut all ties to Spataro. He then continued to promote the life and works of Charles Mason Remey. In 1995 Francis Spataro became an Old Catholic priest and left the Baháʼí religion altogether. The Remey Society is now extinct. Other developmentsFree Baháʼís= The term Free Baháʼís has been used by or about a small number of Baháʼís that have attempted schism from the main body of believers of the Baháʼí Faith. More specifically, it is a form of belief that rejects the authority of Shoghi Effendi, appointed in 1921 to lead the community following the death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. The term was first used by Hermann Zimmer, who revived the earlier claims of Ruth White that the Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was forged. White's claim was widely rejected by other Baháʼís of the time, including Baháʼís who, like her, were enemies of Shoghi Effendi. White was able to gather the support of a single Baháʼí in Germany, Wilhelm Herrigel, who took up her cause; only a few Baháʼís followed him, and most repudiated him following his death in 1932. =The Man= \\"The House of Mankind and the Universal Palace of Order\\" followed Jamshid Ma'ani and John Carré, but appears now to be defunct. In the early 1970s a Persian man named Jamshid Ma'ani claimed he was \\"The Man\\"; or a new Manifestation of God. He gained a few dozen Iranian Baháʼí followers. John Carré heard of Jamshid, and wrote a book trying to get other Baháʼís to accept a new, third Manifestation.See online at The third Manifestation of the Revelation of the Greatest Name, soon to appear Carré even invited \\"The Man\\" to live in his home in California, but soon concluded, after living with \\"The Man\\" for four months, that \\"The Man\\" was not at all godly or spiritual and certainly not a Manifestation of God. \\"The Man\\" went back to Iran, and Carré ended all association with him. =Reginald (\\"Rex\\") King= Rex King rejected all claimants to the Guardianship after Shoghi Effendi including Remey. He claimed that he, Rex King, was a \\"regent\\" pending the emergence of the second Guardian who was in \\"occultation\\". His group called themselves the Orthodox Baháʼí Faith under the Regency. King died in 1977 and appointed four of his family as the council of regents. This group today calls itself the \\"Tarbiyat Baha'i Community\\". NotesReferences   *Browne, E.G.

It extends from the town of Dénia in the north, beyond which lies the Costa del Azahar (or Costa dels Tarongers), to Pilar de la Horadada in the south, beyond which lies the Costa Cálida. Costa Blanca has a well-developed tourism industry and is a popular destination for British and German tourists. The localities along the Costa Blanca are Alicante (Alicante/Alacant), Altea, Benidorm, Benissa (Benisa), Calp (Calpe), Dénia (Denia), Elche (Elche/Elx), El Campello (Campello), Finestrat, Guardamar del Segura, L'Alfàs del Pi (Alfaz del Pi), Orihuela Costa, Pilar de la Horadada, Santa Pola, Teulada–Moraira, Torrevieja, Villajoyosa (Villajoyosa/La Vila Joiosa) and Xàbia (Xàbia/Jávea). Benidorm and Alicante are the major tourist centres. History and politics The Iberians were the oldest documented people living in what today is the Alicante province. Belonging to these there are several archaeologic sites from which is specially known the one in La Serreta (near Alcoy) because the longest inscriptions remaining in the undeciphered Iberian language were found there. Along the coast and contemporarily to the Iberians, the seafaring Phoenicians (in Guardamar) and Greeks (along the coastal section to the north of the Alicante city) settled stable trading colonies and interacted with the former (see Lady of Elche for the most renowned archeological piece of this period). After a brief Carthaginian period, the Romans took over. Romanization in this part of Iberia was intense, the Via Augusta communicated this part of the Empire to the metropoli and so several cities thrived, from which the one known as Ilici Augusta (now Elche) even reached the status of colonia. After a brief period of Visigothic ruling, the area was taken by Islamic armies and became a part of Al Andalus. From the 13th century, kings like Ferdinand III of Castile, James I of Aragon, Alfonso X of Castile, James II of Aragon reconquered the cities that Moors occupied. What today is the Alicante province was initially split between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon by means of the Treaty of Almizra, however later on the whole territory became under the control of the Kingdom of Valencia, which was a component Kingdom of the Crown of Aragon. Alicante contributes with 12 deputies in the Spanish Parliament and with 36 deputies in the Corts Valencianes, the regional Parliament of the Valencian Community.

Latent variables are drawn as circles. Manifest or measured variables are shown as squares. Residuals and variances are drawn as double headed arrows into an object. Note latent IQ variable fixed at 1 to provide scale to the model. Structural equation modeling (SEM) includes a diverse set of mathematical models, computer algorithms, and statistical methods that fit networks of constructs to data. SEM includes confirmatory factor analysis, confirmatory composite analysis, path analysis, partial least squares path modeling, and latent growth modeling. The concept should not be confused with the related concept of structural models in econometrics, nor with structural models in economics. Structural equation models are often used to assess unobservable 'latent' constructs. They often invoke a measurement model that defines latent variables using one or more observed variables, and a structural model that imputes relationships between latent variables. The links between constructs of a structural equation model may be estimated with independent regression equations or through more involved approaches such as those employed in LISREL. Use of SEM is commonly justified in the social sciences because of its ability to impute relationships between unobserved constructs (latent variables) from observable variables. To provide a simple example, the concept of human intelligence cannot be measured directly as one could measure height or weight. Instead, psychologists develop a hypothesis of intelligence and write measurement instruments with items (questions) designed to measure intelligence according to their hypothesis. They would then use SEM to test their hypothesis using data gathered from people who took their intelligence test. With SEM, \\"intelligence\\" would be the latent variable and the test items would be the observed variables. A simplistic model suggesting that intelligence (as measured by four questions) can predict academic performance (as measured by SAT, ACT, and high school GPA) is shown above (top right). In SEM diagrams, latent variables are commonly shown as ovals and observed variables as rectangles. The diagram above shows how error (e) influences each intelligence question and the SAT, ACT, and GPA scores, but does not influence the latent variables. SEM provides numerical estimates for each of the parameters (arrows) in the model to indicate the strength of the relationships. Thus, in addition to testing the overall theory, SEM therefore allows the researcher to diagnose which observed variables are good indicators of the latent variables. Various methods in structural equation modeling have been used in the sciences, business, and other fields. Criticism of SEM methods often addresses pitfalls in mathematical formulation, weak external validity of some accepted models and philosophical bias inherent to the standard procedures.  History  Structural equation modeling, as the term is currently used in sociology, psychology, and other social sciences evolved from the earlier methods in genetic path modeling of Sewall Wright. Their modern forms came about with computer-intensive implementations in the 1960s and 1970s. SEM evolved in three different streams: (1) systems of equation regression methods developed mainly at the Cowles Commission; (2) iterative maximum likelihood algorithms for path analysis developed mainly by Karl Gustav Jöreskog at the Educational Testing Service and subsequently at Uppsala University; and (3) iterative canonical correlation fit algorithms for path analysis also developed at Uppsala University by Hermann Wold. Much of this development occurred at a time that automated computing was offering substantial upgrades over the existing calculator and analogue computing methods available, themselves products of the proliferation of office equipment innovations in the late 20th century. The 2015 text Structural Equation Modeling: From Paths to Networks provides a history of the methods. Loose and confusing terminology has been used to obscure weaknesses in the methods. In particular, PLS-PA (the Lohmoller algorithm) has been conflated with partial least squares regression PLSR, which is a substitute for ordinary least squares regression and has nothing to do with path analysis. PLS-PA has been falsely promoted as a method that works with small datasets when other estimation approaches fail. Westland (2010) decisively showed this not to be true and developed an algorithm for sample sizes in SEM. Since the 1970s, the 'small sample size' assertion has been known to be false (see for example Dhrymes, 1972, 1974; Dhrymes & Erlat, 1972; Dhrymes et al., 1972; Gupta, 1969; Sobel, 1982). Both LISREL and PLS-PA were conceived as iterative computer algorithms, with an emphasis from the start on creating an accessible graphical and data entry interface and extension of Wright's (1921) path analysis. Early Cowles Commission work on simultaneous equations estimation centered on Koopman and Hood's (1953) algorithms from the economics of transportation and optimal routing, with maximum likelihood estimation, and closed form algebraic calculations, as iterative solution search techniques were limited in the days before computers. Anderson and Rubin (1949, 1950) developed the limited information maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters of a single structural equation, which indirectly included the two-stage least squares estimator and its asymptotic distribution (Anderson, 2005) and Farebrother (1999). Two-stage least squares was originally proposed as a method of estimating the parameters of a single structural equation in a system of linear simultaneous equations, being introduced by Theil (1953a, 1953b, 1961) and more or less independently by Basmann (1957) and Sargan (1958). Anderson's limited information maximum likelihood estimation was eventually implemented in a computer search algorithm, where it competed with other iterative SEM algorithms. Of these, two-stage least squares was by far the most widely used method in the 1960s and the early 1970s. Systems of regression equation approaches were developed at the Cowles Commission from the 1950s on, extending the transportation modeling of Tjalling Koopmans. Sewall Wright and other statisticians attempted to promote path analysis methods at Cowles (then at the University of Chicago). University of Chicago statisticians identified many faults with path analysis applications to the social sciences; faults which did not pose significant problems for identifying gene transmission in Wright's context, but which made path methods such as PLS-PA and LISREL problematic in the social sciences. Freedman (1987) summarized these objections in path analyses: \\"failure to distinguish among causal assumptions, statistical implications, and policy claims has been one of the main reasons for the suspicion and confusion surrounding quantitative methods in the social sciences\\" (see also Wold's (1987) response). Wright's path analysis never gained a large following among U.S. econometricians, but was successful in influencing Hermann Wold and his student Karl Jöreskog. Jöreskog's student Claes Fornell promoted LISREL in the US. Advances in computers made it simple for novices to apply structural equation methods in the computer-intensive analysis of large datasets in complex, unstructured problems. The most popular solution techniques fall into three classes of algorithms: (1) ordinary least squares algorithms applied independently to each path, such as applied in the so-called PLS path analysis packages which estimate with OLS; (2) covariance analysis algorithms evolving from seminal work by Wold and his student Karl Jöreskog implemented in LISREL, AMOS, and EQS; and (3) simultaneous equations regression algorithms developed at the Cowles Commission by Tjalling Koopmans. Pearl has extended SEM from linear to nonparametric models, and proposed causal and counterfactual interpretations of the equations. For example, excluding a variable Z from the arguments of an equation asserts that the dependent variable is independent of interventions on the excluded variable, once we hold constant the remaining arguments. Nonparametric SEMs permit the estimation of total, direct and indirect effects without making any commitment to the form of the equations or to the distributions of the error terms. This extends mediation analysis to systems involving categorical variables in the presence of nonlinear interactions. Bollen and Pearl survey the history of the causal interpretation of SEM and why it has become a source of confusions and controversies. SEM path analysis methods are popular in the social sciences because of their accessibility; packaged computer programs allow researchers to obtain results without the inconvenience of understanding experimental design and control, effect and sample sizes, and numerous other factors that are part of good research design. Supporters say that this reflects a holistic, and less blatantly causal, interpretation of many real world phenomena – especially in psychology and social interaction – than may be adopted in the natural sciences; detractors suggest that many flawed conclusions have been drawn because of this lack of experimental control. Direction in the directed network models of SEM arises from presumed cause-effect assumptions made about reality. Social interactions and artifacts are often epiphenomena – secondary phenomena that are difficult to directly link to causal factors. An example of a physiological epiphenomenon is, for example, time to complete a 100-meter sprint. A person may be able to improve their sprint speed from 12 seconds to 11 seconds, but it will be difficult to attribute that improvement to any direct causal factors, like diet, attitude, weather, etc. The 1 second improvement in sprint time is an epiphenomenon – the holistic product of interaction of many individual factors.  General approach to SEM  Although each technique in the SEM family is different, the following aspects are common to many SEM methods. = Model specification = Two main components of models are distinguished in SEM: the structural model showing potential causal dependencies between endogenous and exogenous variables, and the measurement model showing the relations between latent variables and their indicators. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis models, for example, contain only the measurement part, while path diagrams can be viewed as SEMs that contain only the structural part. In specifying pathways in a model, the modeler can posit two types of relationships: (1) free pathways, in which hypothesized causal (in fact counterfactual) relationships between variables are tested, and therefore are left 'free' to vary, and (2) relationships between variables that already have an estimated relationship, usually based on previous studies, which are 'fixed' in the model. A modeler will often specify a set of theoretically plausible models in order to assess whether the model proposed is the best of the set of possible models. Not only must the modeler account for the theoretical reasons for building the model as it is, but the modeler must also take into account the number of data points and the number of parameters that the model must estimate to identify the model. An identified model is a model where a specific parameter value uniquely identifies the model (recursive definition), and no other equivalent formulation can be given by a different parameter value. A data point is a variable with observed scores, like a variable containing the scores on a question or the number of times respondents buy a car. The parameter is the value of interest, which might be a regression coefficient between the exogenous and the endogenous variable or the factor loading (regression coefficient between an indicator and its factor). If there are fewer data points than the number of estimated parameters, the resulting model is \\"unidentified\\", since there are too few reference points to account for all the variance in the model. The solution is to constrain one of the paths to zero, which means that it is no longer part of the model. = Estimation of free parameters = Parameter estimation is done by comparing the actual covariance matrices representing the relationships between variables and the estimated covariance matrices of the best fitting model. This is obtained through numerical maximization via expectation–maximization of a fit criterion as provided by maximum likelihood estimation, quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, weighted least squares or asymptotically distribution-free methods. This is often accomplished by using a specialized SEM analysis program, of which several exist. = Assessment of model and model fit = Having estimated a model, analysts will want to interpret the model. Estimated paths may be tabulated and/or presented graphically as a path model. The impact of variables is assessed using path tracing rules (see path analysis). It is important to examine the \\"fit\\" of an estimated model to determine how well it models the data. This is a basic task in SEM modeling, forming the basis for accepting or rejecting models and, more usually, accepting one competing model over another. The output of SEM programs includes matrices of the estimated relationships between variables in the model. Assessment of fit essentially calculates how similar the predicted data are to matrices containing the relationships in the actual data. Formal statistical tests and fit indices have been developed for these purposes. Individual parameters of the model can also be examined within the estimated model in order to see how well the proposed model fits the driving theory. Most, though not all, estimation methods make such tests of the model possible. Of course as in all statistical hypothesis tests, SEM model tests are based on the assumption that the correct and complete relevant data have been modeled. In the SEM literature, discussion of fit has led to a variety of different recommendations on the precise application of the various fit indices and hypothesis tests. There are differing approaches to assessing fit. Traditional approaches to modeling start from a null hypothesis, rewarding more parsimonious models (i.e. those with fewer free parameters), to others such as AIC that focus on how little the fitted values deviate from a saturated model (i.e. how well they reproduce the measured values), taking into account the number of free parameters used. Because different measures of fit capture different elements of the fit of the model, it is appropriate to report a selection of different fit measures. Guidelines (i.e., \\"cutoff scores\\") for interpreting fit measures, including the ones listed below, are the subject of much debate among SEM researchers. Some of the more commonly used measures of fit include: * Chi-squared ** A fundamental measure of fit used in the calculation of many other fit measures. Conceptually it is a function of the sample size and the difference between the observed covariance matrix and the model covariance matrix. * Akaike information criterion (AIC) ** A test of relative model fit: The preferred model is the one with the lowest AIC value. ** \\\\mathit{AIC} = 2k - 2\\\\ln(L)\\\\, ** where k is the number of parameters in the statistical model, and L is the maximized value of the likelihood of the model. * Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) **Fit index where a value of zero indicates the best fit. While the guideline for determining a \\"close fit\\" using RMSEA is highly contested, most researchers concur that an RMSEA of .1 or more indicates poor fit. * Standardized Root Mean Residual (SRMR) ** The SRMR is a popular absolute fit indicator. Hu and Bentler (1999) suggested .08 or smaller as a guideline for good fit. Kline (2011) suggested .1 or smaller as a guideline for good fit. * Comparative Fit Index (CFI) **In examining baseline comparisons, the CFI depends in large part on the average size of the correlations in the data. If the average correlation between variables is not high, then the CFI will not be very high. A CFI value of .95 or higher is desirable. For each measure of fit, a decision as to what represents a good-enough fit between the model and the data must reflect other contextual factors such as sample size, the ratio of indicators to factors, and the overall complexity of the model. For example, very large samples make the Chi-squared test overly sensitive and more likely to indicate a lack of model-data fit. = Model modification = The model may need to be modified in order to improve the fit, thereby estimating the most likely relationships between variables. Many programs provide modification indices which may guide minor modifications. Modification indices report the change in χ² that result from freeing fixed parameters: usually, therefore adding a path to a model which is currently set to zero. Modifications that improve model fit may be flagged as potential changes that can be made to the model. Modifications to a model, especially the structural model, are changes to the theory claimed to be true. Modifications therefore must make sense in terms of the theory being tested, or be acknowledged as limitations of that theory. Changes to measurement model are effectively claims that the items/data are impure indicators of the latent variables specified by theory.Loehlin, J. C. (2004). Latent Variable Models: An Introduction to Factor, Path, and Structural Equation Analysis. Psychology Press. Models should not be led by MI, as Maccallum (1986) demonstrated: \\"even under favorable conditions, models arising from specification searches must be viewed with caution.\\" = Sample size and power = While researchers agree that large sample sizes are required to provide sufficient statistical power and precise estimates using SEM, there is no general consensus on the appropriate method for determining adequate sample size. Generally, the considerations for determining sample size include the number of observations per parameter, the number of observations required for fit indexes to perform adequately, and the number of observations per degree of freedom. Researchers have proposed guidelines based on simulation studies, professional experience, and mathematical formulas. Sample size requirements to achieve a particular significance and power in SEM hypothesis testing are similar for the same model when any of the three algorithms (PLS-PA, LISREL or systems of regression equations) are used for testing. = Interpretation and communication = The set of models are then interpreted so that claims about the constructs can be made, based on the best fitting model. Caution should always be taken when making claims of causality even when experimentation or time-ordered studies have been done. The term causal model must be understood to mean \\"a model that conveys causal assumptions\\", not necessarily a model that produces validated causal conclusions. Collecting data at multiple time points and using an experimental or quasi-experimental design can help rule out certain rival hypotheses but even a randomized experiment cannot rule out all such threats to causal inference. Good fit by a model consistent with one causal hypothesis invariably entails equally good fit by another model consistent with an opposing causal hypothesis. No research design, no matter how clever, can help distinguish such rival hypotheses, save for interventional experiments. As in any science, subsequent replication and perhaps modification will proceed from the initial finding.  Advanced uses  * Measurement invariance * Multiple group modelling: This is a technique allowing joint estimation of multiple models, each with different sub-groups. Applications include behavior genetics, and analysis of differences between groups (e.g., gender, cultures, test forms written in different languages, etc.). * Latent growth modeling * Hierarchical/multilevel models; item response theory models * Mixture model (latent class) SEM * Alternative estimation and testing techniques * Robust inference * Survey sampling analyses * Multi-method multi-trait models * Structural Equation Model Trees  SEM-specific software  Several software packages exist for fitting structural equation models. LISREL was the first such software, initially released in the 1970s. There are also several packages for the R open source statistical environment. The OpenMx R package provides an open source and enhanced version of the Mx application. Scholars consider it good practice to report which software package and version was used for SEM analysis because they have different capabilities and may use slightly different methods to perform similarly-named techniques.

Background and production Guitarist Matt Watts and drummer Mike Golla met while at a mutual friend's band practice. They formed their own group and started searching for a vocalist. The pair looked through AOL's member directory and emailed a number of people. They came across Kenny Vasoli, and subsequently met him while he was playing with his own band. He was drafted into Watts and Golla's group, which broke up after a week. The members remained in contact, and formed The Starting Line in mid-1999 under the name Sunday Drive. Drummer Tom Gryskiewitz was brought into the fold after him and Watts met at a restaurant. Golla subsequently moved to guitar. They wrote material in their practice space and tracked demos. They started gaining publicity with the aid of AOL and MP3.com. Independent label We the People Records became aware of the group's demos and signed them in mid-2000. The band recorded an album's worth of material with producer Chris Badami, which was due for release in early 2001. However, it wasn't released due to the intervention of independent label Drive-Thru Records, who saw the group's commercial potential. We the People Records, who had ties with Drive-Thru, had arranged a showcase for the label's founders Stefanie and Richard Reines. The pair were impressed with the band, but thought the songs lacked choruses. The group went away and reworked the material, before signing to Drive-Thru in April 2001. At the time, Vasoli was in high school and Watts was in college. With help from a guidance counsellor, Vasoli graduated early. The band changed their name to the Starting Line following threats from a Missouri-based act also called Sunday Drive. The group released the With Hopes of Starting Over... EP in July. Following this, the group became a full-time touring act. In January 2002, the group began recording Say It Like You Mean It. at Media Vortex with producer Mark Trombino, who Golla said brought \\"an extra set of ears to the table\\". \\"Leaving\\" and \\"Saddest Girl Story\\", two tracks that originally appeared on the With Hopes of Starting Over... EP, were re-recorded for Say It Like You Mean It. \\"Almost There, Going Nowhere\\", \\"Cheek to Cheek\\", \\"Left Coast Envy\\" and \\"The Drama Summer\\", which were originally recorded for the We the People album, were also re-recorded. Nate Barcalow of Finch and Keith Goodwin of Days Away contributed additional vocals; the former on \\"Cheek to Cheek\\" and \\"This Ride\\", the latter on \\"Left Coast Envy\\". Trombino mixed the recordings at The Robot Factory in Los Angeles, California, before they were mastered by Steven Marcussen at Marcussen Mastering in Hollywood. The album's title is taken from a line in \\"Almost There, Going Nowhere\\". All of the songs were written by the band, except for \\"The Drama Summer\\" which was credited solely to Vasoli. The group usually worked on material together through jamming, where they would hear a part they enjoyed and expanded on it. On occasion, Golla or Vasoli arrived at practice with a complete song already written. Vasoli who was 17 years old at the time said the \\"meaner\\" tracks were about one of his ex-girlfriend. Similarly, \\"Hello Houston\\" and \\"A Goodnight's Sleep\\" were about a different ex-girlfriend. Vasoli said that despite him not being \\"that bitter about it anymore\\", he found it \\"funny to rehash\\". The opening track \\"Up & Go\\" details a girl leaving despite having no reason to do so, \\"Given the Chance\\" is about the group's fans, specifically the ones in New Jersey. They found it hard to attract an audience in their home state of Philadelphia, but found it easier in New Jersey.\\"Leaving\\" sees Vasoli yearning for unrequited love. \\"The Best of Me\\" has an acoustic intro, before shifting into punk rock track. \\"A Goodnight's Sleep\\" is a ballad. Release On February 6, 2002, Say It Like You Mean It was announced for release in July. In April and May, the group went on tour with Brand New and Finch. Following this, the band went on a UK tour with New Found Glory and Finch. Between late June and mid-August, the group performed on the Warped Tour, appearing on the Drive-Thru stage. Say It Like You Mean It was made available for streaming on July 13, before being released on July 16 as a joint release by Drive-Thru and major label MCA Records. The group went on tour with Reel Big Fish in September and October. On October 27, a music video for \\"The Best of Me\\" was posted on Launch.com. The video starts with a guy attempting to impress a girl by playing music from a boombox outside of her residence. When the music stops, the band appear and start performing. In early and mid-November, the band toured with Taking Back Sunday, the Early November and the Exit, before touring with Park, The Early November and Yellowcard for the remainder of the month. Further touring with Taking Back Sunday, alongside the Reunion Show and Northstar, followed in December. In January 2003, the group went on a tour of Japan with New Found Glory and Good Charlotte, before embarking on a European tour with Reel Big Fish and Sugarcult. To coincide with these shows, Say It Like You Mean It was released in those territories. Between mid-February and late April, they went on a US tour with Sum 41, No Use for a Name and Authority Zero. A new music video was posted online for \\"The Best of Me\\" through MTV.com on June 13. The group went on a UK tour in June with support from From Autumn to Ashes and The Reunion Show. \\"The Best of Me\\" was released as a single on June 16. The group performed a few shows with Mae and River City High and Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer in early and mid-July. In mid- July and early August, the group appeared on the Warped Tour, playing on the main stage. \\"The Best of Me\\" was released to modern rock radio stations on July 22. Between late August and mid-October, the group performed on the Drive-Thru Records 2003 Invasion Tour. In early September, a music video was filmed for \\"Leaving\\". It premiered during MTV2's Rock programme in November. Reception and legacy AllMusic reviewer Kurt Morris said the record was \\"full of bubbly, positive lyrics\\", amidst \\"plenty of upbeats and catchy hooks.\\" In a review for Rolling Stone, music critic J.D. Considine noted that the band had based their sound on the Green Day \\"blueprint, with plenty of bright, singalong choruses and hyperstrummed power chords.\\" Despite the comparison to Green Day, he viewed the Starting Line as being more progressive musically and lyrically than them. Ultimate Guitar Archive noted that Vasoli's was deeper compared to the group's earlier works, and called his lyrics heartfelt. As of July 2007, it has sold close to 300,000 copies. In October 2012, independent label SRC Vinyl released the We the People album under the name The Early Years. Following this, the group went on an anniversary tour for Say It Like You Mean It, during which they performed it in its entirety, in December. In May 2014, the album was re-pressed on vinyl through SRC Vinyl with the bonus tracks \\"Greg's Last Day\\" and an acoustic version of \\"The Best of Me\\". Later that year, Rock Sound included the album on their The 51 Most Essential Pop Punk Albums of All Time list at number 21.Bird, ed. 2014, p. 72 Kerrang! similarly included the album at number 27 on their 51 Greatest Pop- Punk Albums list.McMahon ed. 2015, p. 20 In a 2016 listicle, Rob Rousseau of A.Side TV viewed the album as a \\"masterwork\\" of the \\"era-defining Drive Thru Records ouvre.\\"  Track listing  All songs written by the Starting Line, except \\"The Drama Summer\\" by Kenny Vasoli.

Because many of these criminals came from the well-known British penal colonies in Australia, and were known to commit arson, they were blamed for an 1849 fire that devastated the heart of San Francisco, as well as the rampant crime in the city at the time. Mick Sinclair, San Francisco: a cultural and literary history, Signal Books, 2004 pp. 54-57 The Sydney Ducks were criminals who operated as a gang, in a community that also included sailors, longshoremen, teamsters, wheelwrights, shipwrights, bartenders, saloon keepers, washerwomen, domestic servants, and dressmakers. The largest proportion (44%) were born in Ireland and migrated during the Great Irish Famine, first to Australia as laborers and then to California as part of the Gold Rush. The criminality of the Sydney Ducks was the catalyst for the formation of the first Committee of Vigilance of 1851. The vigilantes usurped political power from the corrupt or incompetent officials in the city, conducted secret trials, lynchings, and deportations, which effectively decimated the Sydney Ducks. The area where the Sydney Ducks clustered at the base of Telegraph Hill was originally known as \\"Sydney-Town,\\" but by the 1860s was called exclusively by its better-known name, the Barbary Coast. On December 19, 1854, five members of the gang were involved in the Jonathan R.

The use of a water bottle allows an individual to drink and transport a beverage from one place to another. A water bottle is usually made of plastic, glass, or metal. Water bottles are available in different shapes, colors, and sizes. In the past, water bottles were sometimes made of wood, bark, or animal skins such as leather, hide and sheepskin. Water bottles can be either disposable or reusable. Reusable water bottles can also be used for liquids such as juice, iced tea, alcoholic beverages, or soft drinks. Reusable water bottles reduce plastic waste and contribute to saving the environment. Easily portable, water bottles make for convenient use. Water bottles often list nutrition facts. TypesSingle- use plastic= A one gallon PETE water bottle with attached package handle Sales of single-use, pre-filled plastic water bottles have increased almost every single year for more than a decade. In 2011, greater than US$11 billion was spent on bottled water products in the United States alone. In 2017, The US spent $11.5 billion on bottled waters. The International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) states that people are increasingly relying on water bottles for convenience and portability. In some countries with low-quality tap water, citizens also use bottled water (including in family-size containers kept in the home) for health reasons. For example, as of 2010, Mexico had an average 8 percent increase per year in bottled water purchases, and consumed approximately 13 percent of the world's total of bottled water. Mexican citizens drink more bottled water than those of any other country do, an average of 61.8 gallons per person each year – more than twice the rate of US per capita consumption. The increase in the use of single-use personal plastic water bottles has contributed markedly to the country's litter problem, though the increase in the popularity of bottled water has come with a decrease in the growth rate of consumption of soft drinks (which pose health risks in excessive quantities, as well as the same littering problem). =Reusable plastic= Multi-use water bottles can be made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), copolyester, or polypropylene. All offer the advantage of being durable, lightweight, dishwasher-safe, and BPA-free. The main difference between each type of water bottle is the flexibility of the material. Copolyester and polypropylene offer the greatest rigidity; HDPE retains some flexibility; LDPE (most commonly associated with collapsible, squeeze bottles) is highly flexible. =Metal= Metal water bottles Metal water bottles are growing in popularity. Made primarily from stainless steel or aluminium (aluminum), they are durable, retain less odor and taste from previous contents than most plastic bottles, but can sometime impart a metallic taste. Metal bottles thus often contain a resin or epoxy liner to protect contents from taste and odor transfer or corrosion. Although most liners are now BPA-free, older and less expensive models can contain BPA. Glass liners may also be used . It is not recommended to fill aluminium bottles with acidic liquids (e.g. orange juice), as this could cause aluminium to leach into the contents of the bottle. Depending on the type of source material and manufacturing process behind a stainless steel bottle, trace amounts of minerals can leach into contents from this type of bottle as well. Stainless steel bottles that do not contain a liner have been known to transfer a rusty taste and odor to contents. Bottles made with food- grade stainless steel (grade 304, also known as 18/8) do not transfer taste or odor. Metal (especially steel) water bottles can be heavier than their plastic counterparts. Single-walled metal bottles readily transfer temperature of contents to external surfaces, which makes them unsuitable for use with unusually hot or cold liquids. Double-walled metal bottles are insulated to keep cold liquids cold and hot liquids hot, without the external surface being too hot or too cold. Because double-walled bottles have more metal in them, they are more expensive. They are typically vacuum-insulated, but some may have a solid or gel insulation between the metal walls. =Glass= Glass water bottle with protective silicone sleeve Glass flasks have been used since ancient times, though were not common until the Early Modern period when consistent, bulk manufacturing of glass products became easier. Because they are completely recyclable, are BPA-free, and do not retain and transfer taste or odor, glass water bottles are becoming a popular choice again for many consumers concerned about their health. Glass bottles are heavier than plastic, stainless steel, or aluminium, and are easier to damage or completely break. Like metal, they also have a high level of temperature transfer, so they are not ideal for very hot or cold liquids. Some types of vacuum- insulated flasks use an inner layer of glass (which is easy to clean), and an outer layer of metal or plastic which helps shield the glass from breakage. Such bottles may still break if dropped, and thus some brands are triple- layer, with the glass inside two layers of plastic; this is a common configuration for large flasks intended for coffee or other liquids that need to be insulated. =Filtering= Carbon filtering water bottle. This type of bottle is often BPA-Free and more commonly uses carbon (activated charcoal) filtration. UV light can also be used to purify water. UV filtration bottles are popular and convenient for those who are traveling to areas where water quality may be harmful, or where bottled water is not readily available. UV is effective against all water-borne pathogens. Carbon filtration bottles will eliminate some organic chemicals and improve the taste and odor of water. Carbon filtration will not eliminate pathogens, metals or nitrates from water. Carbon filters must be changed regularly to maintain effectiveness. =Wirelessly connected= Connected devices collect data related to a person's water intake. The data is transmitted to a smartphone, which enables tracking of an individual's water intake and alerts the user when they are not properly hydrated. These devices are a result of recent technology advancements which fall in the broader category of the Internet of Things. Devices that monitor and collect data related to one's personal health are also part of the quantified self movement. While several concepts have been introduced, none are currently available commercially. =Hydration reservoirs= Hydration reservoir Hydration reservoirs, also known as hydration bladders, are large-volume, flexible bags typically carried in a backpack system. Users access water via a sipping tube. This system allows the user to remain engaged in activity without having to stop and unscrew a water bottle. Such reservoirs also permit the carrying of a larger water supply (thus a longer hike), as they have both more capacity and better integration into the carrying equipment than an external water bottle or canteen attached to the pack or belt. Popularity Due to growing concern over the environmental impact and cost of disposable plastic water bottles, more people are choosing to fill multi-use water bottles. However, the popularity and availability of disposable plastic water bottles continues to rise. In 2007, Americans consumed 50 billion single-serve bottles of water. Since 2001, the sale of single-serve bottled water has fluctuated by 70 percent, and this trend is continuing. In 2016, a trend among Americans called \\"water bottle flipping\\" attracted media attention. This trend has since died out and other trends are taking its place. ConsequencesHealth= Chemicals used for making some types of bottles have been shown to be detrimental to the health of humans. Inhalation of chemicals used in the manufacture of plastics is a hazard for the factory workers who handle the material. In many developing countries, plastic waste is burned rather than recycled or deposited in landfills. Rural residents of developing countries who burn plastic as a disposal method are not protected from the chemical inhalation hazards associated with this practice. Inhalation of the pollutants produced from burning plastics have been shown to result in poor health outcomes. It is important to dispose of water that has been stored in PET bottles beyond the expiration date because harmful chemicals may leach from the plastic. Bottle manufacturing relies on fossil fuels and natural resources. Some manufacturing processes release toxic chemicals into the air and water supply that can adversely affect nervous systems, blood, kidneys, immune systems, and can cause cancer and birth defects. Most disposable water bottles are made from petroleum derived polyethylene terephthalate (PET). While PET is considered less toxic than many other types of plastic, the Berkeley Ecology Center found that manufacturing PET generates toxic emissions in the form of nickel, ethylbenzene, ethylene oxide and benzene at levels 100 times higher than those created to make the same amount of glass. =Environment= Label on disposable water bottle highlighting positive environmental attributes. Water bottles made of glass, aluminium and steel are the most readily recyclable. HDPE and LDPE bottles can be recycled as well. Because the manufacturing and transportation of disposable water bottles requires petroleum, a non-renewable resource, the single-serve bottled water industry has come under pressure from concerned consumers. The Pacific Institute calculates that it required about 17 million barrels of oil to make the disposable plastic bottles for single- serve water that Americans consumed in 2006. To sustain the consumptive use of products relying on plastic components and level of manufactured demand for plastic water bottles, the end result is shortages of fossil fuels. Furthermore, it means not only a shortage of the raw materials to make plastics, but also a shortage of the energy required to fuel their production.Cormier, Zoe. Plastic Unfantastic. This Magazine, Mar–Apr. 2008 18+. General OneFile. Accessed, Feb 24, 2012. In recent years, the single- serve bottled water industry has responded to consumer concern about the environmental impact of disposable water bottles by significantly reducing the amount of plastic used in bottles. The reduced plastic content also results in a lower weight product that uses less energy to transport. Other bottle manufacturing companies are experimenting with alternative materials such as corn starch to make new bottles that are more readily biodegradable. The lowest impact water bottles are those made of glass or metal. They are not made from petroleum and are easily recyclable. By choosing to continuously fill any multi-use water bottle, the consumer keeps disposable bottles out of the waste stream and minimizes environmental impact.

Newman (born May 6, 1952) is an American actor, voice actor, composer, comedian, musician, singer, foley artist, and former talk show host.  Career  Newman's first job in New York City was at Newsweek. After doing comedy, Newman soon capitalized on his unique vocalizations, and Peter Workman (Workman Publishing) signed Fred to write the best-selling book MouthSounds (first published in 1980 with a vinyl record insert, and updated with a CD in 2004). Newman was an actor and sound-effects artist on Garrison Keillor's live radio variety show A Prairie Home Companion. In an audience favorite feature of the program, Keillor tells an apparently impromptu story that is funny because it requires Newman to strain to supply rapid-fire sound effects for unusual occurrences and obscure animals. Newman was featured in an interview with Jane Pauley on CBS Sunday Morning and the segment was nominated for an Emmy. He has also done character voices and sounds effects in numerous film, television and video game credits, including Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Doug (as Skeeter Valentine, Porkchop, Mr. Dink, and other characters), Grand Theft Auto 2, Harry and the Hendersons, Gremlins, Munchies, Storybook World, Wolf and Men in Black. Newman performing with Garrison Keillor at the 2017 Minnesota State Fair Newman hosted Livewire, a children's talk show on Nickelodeon in the early 1980s. Livewire was known for giving bands their first television appearance, including R.E.M. and Split Enz. He was also a host for Nickelodeon's Halloween TV special game, Nick or Treat! Newman worked with Jim Henson and the Muppets in the 1980s, first as a contributor to Muppet Magazine, then as the writer of the Muppet Show On Tour live show. In 1987, Newman played the lead role in Henson's CBS sitcom pilot Puppetman. Newman also appeared in a 1988 Henson direct-to-video special called Neat Stuff to Know & to Do. Prior to the 2000 Presidential Election, Newman was cast as the voice of Garry Trudeau's comic strip character Duke who ran for president. He provided both voice and motion capture for Duke 2000, a series of online computer animated shorts, and can still be heard in the \\"Ask Duke\\" interactive game. He also provided the voice of Trudeau's Jimmy Thudpucker character for a NetAid concert. As an on-camera performer, he was the co-host (1989–1993) of The All New Mickey Mouse Club (1989–1994) (with Mowava Pryor or Terri Eoff Misner as the other co-host) that launched the careers of Britney Spears, Keri Russell, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, JC Chasez and Ryan Gosling among others. Newman can be seen on the PBS reading series Between the Lions, for which he also writes and provides animated voices, and as the conductor on PBS' Lomax, the Hound of Music. Newman won two writing Emmys for Between the Lions. As a musician, he has composed music for the animated series Doug and PB&J; Otter and wrote songs for Doug's 1st Movie. In 2015 he made a guest appearance on Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja. Chrysopylae, a symphony commissioned by the Marin Symphony Orchestra to mark the 75th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge, was written by composer Rob Kapilow with Newman, who was also the sound effects designer for the Golden Gate Opus. The world premiere was on May 6, 2012, at the Main Veterans' Memorial Auditorium in Marin County, California.  Personal life  Newman was born in LaGrange, Georgia. He is a 1974 graduate of the University of Georgia, and received an MBA at Harvard Business School in 1978. Fred Newman married Katy Dobbs in 1985, and the couple has two children: Gil John Newman (son) and Lila Claire Newman (daughter). Lila appeared on A Prairie Home Companion (APHC) as an actor and singer at Ravinia in Chicago and at Town Hall in NYC. Lila began contributing sketches and writing to APHC on a weekly basis in November 2013 and receives on-air credits for her work. Lila also writes radio dramas for The Truth. Both of Newman's children are pursuing acting careers. Lila starred as Charlotte 'Cee' Biggs, John Goodman's daughter, on Season 2 of Alpha House on Amazon Prime.

The full game contains three episodes (Alpha, Beta, Gamma), each with twenty missions, in which the player pilots a \\"hoverskid\\" about a war-torn city to complete certain mission objectives. The game was released as freeware under the Creative Commons License CC BY-ND 3.0 in 2007.https://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Traffic_Department_2192.html Story The player takes on the role of Lieutenant Marta Louise Velasquez, a hot-tempered young pilot working for the Traffic Department in the city of Vulthaven, on the planet Seche, in the year 2192. Since the vile gang known as the Vultures began attempts to take over the planet, the Traffic Department has become the only law-enforcement in the city. As the game's introduction explains, fourteen years earlier, Velasquez saw her father Ric killed by the Vultures while returning from garrison duty. The story deals with Velasquez's aggressive attitude towards everybody she meets, apparently caused by the painful memory of her father. Intertwined is a complex science fiction story of cloning, mind control, and cybernetics, combined with a tale of betrayal, infiltration, and warfare. Development The game was scored by Robert A. Allen. However, John Pallett-Plowright wrote Satair, and his 13-year-old brother, Michael Pallett-Plowright, also known as Owen Pallett, wrote Menu, Vulture, Intro 2, and Death. The most notable aspect of the series is the detailed and often complex script by Christopher Perkins. The game features lengthy cutscenes before and after each of the sixty missions. Each cutscene spans across multiple scenes, giving the game's storyline a reported length of 50,000 words. The cutscenes are made up of conversations between two or more characters on the screen with static 3D images of locations cut between each scene. The game's dialogue features both profanity and sexually-suggestive language, but there is an option at the start of the game to disable all mature content.

The company provides financial services including car finance, online banking via a direct bank, corporate lending, vehicle insurance, mortgage loans, and an electronic trading platform to trade financial assets. Ally is one of the largest car finance companies in the U.S., providing car financing and leasing for 4.5 million customers and originating 1.4 million car loans annually. It is on the list of largest banks in the United States by assets and has 2.0 million depositors. Its electronic trading platform has approximately 350,000 funded accounts. Via its SmartAuction online marketplace for auto auctions, launched in 2000, the company has sold more than 5 million vehicles, including 270,000 vehicles sold in 2019. The company was known as GMAC, an acronym for General Motors Acceptance Corporation, until 2010. History The company was founded in 1919 by General Motors (GM) as the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) to provide financing to automotive customers. In 1939, the company founded Motors Insurance Corporation and entered the vehicle insurance market. In 1985, while GM was under the leadership of Roger Smith, who sought to diversify the company, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage, which included an $11 billion mortgage portfolio. In 1991, the company was forced to write-off $275 million in bad debt as part of a $436 million loss suffered from fraud committed by John McNamara, who ran a Ponzi scheme. In 1998, the company formed GMAC Real Estate. In 1999, GMAC Mortgage acquired Ditech. In 2000, the company formed GMAC Bank, a direct bank. In 2005, the company formed GMAC ResCap as a holding company for its mortgage operations. In 2006, General Motors sold a 51% interest in GMAC to Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm. Also that year, GMAC sold a controlling interest of GMAC Commercial Holdings (its real estate division renamed Capmark) to Goldman Sachs, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and Five Mile Capital Partners. GMAC Real Estate was sold to Brookfield Asset Management. In 2009, Capmark filed for bankruptcy and its North American loan origination and servicing business was acquired by Berkadia, a joint venture of Leucadia National and Berkshire Hathaway. On December 24, 2008, the Federal Reserve accepted the company's application to become a bank holding company. In January 2009, the company shut down Nuvell Financial Services, its subprime lending division. As a result of losses in GMAC ResCap, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $17.2 billion in the company in 2008–2009. The Treasury sold its last stake in the company in 2014, recovering $19.6 billion from its $17.2 billion investment. In May 2009 GMAC Bank was rebranded as Ally Bank. In May 2010, GMAC re-branded itself as Ally Financial. In September 2010, the company sold its resort finance business to Centerbridge Partners. In 2012, the company sold its Canadian banking operations to Royal Bank of Canada for $3.8 billion. In April 2014, it became a public company via an initial public offering. In 2015, it moved its headquarters to One Detroit Center, which was subsequently renamed Ally Detroit Center. In June 2016, the company acquired TradeKing, a stockbrokerage, for $275 million, which was re-branded as Ally Invest. In May 2016, Ally Bank re-entered the mortgage business with the launch of its direct-to-consumer offering called Ally Home. In April 2019, Ally Home partnered with Better.com to launch a digital mortgage platform. In 2016, the company moved more than 1,500 employees to 13 floors of Ally Detroit Center. In 2017, Ally signed a lease for 400,000 square feet at the Ally Charlotte Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, scheduled to be completed in 2021, and will move its offices from 440 South Church. In September 2020, Ally Financial pledged to invest $30 million in communities, namely in Charlotte, North Carolina and Detroit, Michigan, across its geographic footprint during the next three years. This pledge included the formation of the Ally Charitable Foundation, headquartered in Charlotte, whose goal will be to provide grants to organizations concerned with financial education, affordable housing, as well as digital job training in order to improve economic mobility and \\"support efforts to combat social injustice.\\" The president of the foundation, Mike Rizer, stated that \\"In addition to supporting organizations doing exemplary work in promoting economic mobility, we will use the foundation as an important new avenue to listen, collaborate, and learn, in order to drive lasting, equitable changes in the communities we serve.\\" Sponsorships The company sponsors the Miami International Auto Show, the Time Magazine Quality Dealer Award, and The Ally Challenge. In 2019, Ally became the primary sponsor for seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson at Hendrick Motorsports, a sponsorship that runs through 2023. As GMAC, the company previously had primary sponsorships with Hendrick Motorsports from 1998 through 2007 with drivers Jack Sprague, Ricky Hendrick, Brian Vickers and Casey Mears, including Vickers' 2003 NASCAR Busch Series championship victory. Ally is also a sponsor of Charlotte FC. Legal issues2013 discrimination settlement= In December 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and United States Department of Justice ordered the company to pay $80 million in consumer monetary damages and $18 million in civil penalties after determining that 235,000 minority borrowers paid higher interest rates for auto loans originated between April 2011 and December 2013 because of the company's discriminatory pricing system. The higher rates resulted from the company's specific policy of allowing dealers to charge, at their discretion, a \\"dealer markup\\" above Ally's established \\"buy rate\\" and then compensating dealers based on the markup. Ally provided an incentive for dealers to charge higher rates, which disproportionately affected minority borrowers, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

Typically a sipper bottle consists of a plastic portion used to contain the water, a plastic cap, and a metal tube with a ball bearing inside. The vacuum formed by the presence of the ball bearing keeps water from flowing out of the bottle. An animal can interrupt this vacuum by pressing against the ball bearing and forcing it slightly up the tube—thus an animal can drink from the bottle by licking the metal ball bearing. A water bottle can be affixed to the side of an animal's cage from the outside (using the wire that normally comes with the bottle) or from the inside (using a separate water bottle holder utilizing a suction cup or a metal support, both of which can be purchased at most pet stores). Though water bottles are most commonly used for pocket pets such as rodents, rabbits, and ferrets, any mammal can be trained to use a water bottle large enough for it.

A short article on the Hotheaded Naked Ice Borer first appeared in the April 1995 issue of Discover magazine. The article was written by Tim Folger, then an editor at the magazine. Folger wrote several other April Fool stories for the magazine, including a basketball-sized particle named the \\"bigon\\", and the discovery of prehistoric musical instruments— rhinoceros bladder bagpipes, a mastodon-tusk tuba, and a bone triangle—supposedly used by Neanderthals. Hoax The article carried a purported photo of a Naked mole rat-like creature with a bony growth protruding from its head. According to the article, this animal had recently been discovered in Antarctica. The bony structure was suffused with tiny blood vessels that would heat it to a temperature high enough to melt through the ice. To acquire food, a group of these animals would burrow into the ice underneath suitable prey, and use their heads to melt through. When the animal, usually a penguin, sank helplessly into the water, the group of Borers would devour it. It was even speculated in the article that Antarctic explorer \\"Philippe Poisson\\" (poisson d'avril, \\"April fish,\\" is the French equivalent of \\"April fool\\") may have been eaten by a group of these animals when he disappeared in 1837. A clue that indicated that the Ice Borer story was a hoax can be found in the name of the biologist who discovered the animal, \\"Aprile Pazzo\\" (\\"April Fool\\" in Italian). Cleber Redondo, a deputy art director, created image by digitally manipulating an image of a naked mole- rat, adding fangs and a \\"bony growth\\" (based on a trilobite) with a \\"red-hot\\" front edge. Influence Discover magazine received more mail about this article than about any other article it had ever published.

Life The second son of the 9th Earl of Northampton (later the First Marquess), Compton studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, receiving a Master of Arts degree in 1810. In 1812, following the assassination of his cousin, the prime minister Spencer Perceval, Compton, by now Earl Compton as heir to the Marquessate, took his seat for Northampton in the House of Commons. In the Commons, Compton established a reputation as something of a maverick. Despite his family's strong Tory credentials, he often voted against the Tory government of the day. This led to his losing his seat in the general election of 1820. After 1820 Compton took up residence in Italy, where his house became a centre of attraction, and exercised his influence in favour of many of the unfortunate victims of despotic authority both in Lombardy and in Naples. He returned to England in 1830, and became a prominent figure in political and cultural life. He supported the Reform Bill in the House of Lords, but became more engaged in promoting the arts and sciences. In 1820–22 he was president of the Geological Society of London. He served as president of the Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland (1845–46 and 1850–51), and in 1838 became president of the Royal Society, an office he held for ten years. He took a particular interest in geology, especially in fossils, although he was not himself a scientist, but more of an interested amateur. The dinosaur species Regnosaurus northamptoni was named after him. He resigned in 1848, due to his opposition to the Society's increasing professionalization. Compton was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1846. He held the position of President of the Royal Society of Literature from 1849 until his death. He died on 17 January 1851, and was buried at Castle Ashby on 25 January. Family On 24 July 1815 Compton married Margaret Douglas-Maclean-Clephane, who was a poet admired by Sir Walter Scott and William Wordsworth, although her poetry was not published. The marriage was a happy one, producing six children. The couple lived in Italy for ten years from 1820 to 1830. Compton succeeded his father as Marquess of Northampton in 1828.

Delegates sought reforms from the Mexican government and hoped to quell the widespread belief that settlers in Texas wished to secede from Mexico. The convention was the first in a series of unsuccessful attempts at political negotiation that eventually led to the Texas Revolution. Under the 1824 Constitution of Mexico, Texas was denied independent statehood and merged into the new state Coahuila y Tejas. After growing suspicion that the United States government would attempt to seize Texas by force, in 1830 Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante enacted the Law of April 6, 1830 which restricted immigration and called for customs duty enforcement. Tensions erupted in June 1832, when Texas residents systematically expelled all Mexican troops from eastern Texas. The lack of military oversight emboldened the colonists to increase their political activity. On October 1, 1832, 55 political delegates met at San Felipe de Austin to petition for changes in the governance of Texas. Notably absent was any representation from San Antonio de Béxar, where many of the native Mexican settlers (Tejanos) lived. The delegates elected Stephen F. Austin, a highly respected empresario, as president of the convention. Delegates passed a series of resolutions requesting, among other things, a repeal of the immigration restrictions, a three-year exclusion from customs duties enforcement, permission to form an armed militia and independent statehood. They also voted themselves the power to call future conventions. Before the petition could be delivered to Mexico City, the political chief of Texas, Ramón Músquiz, ruled that the convention was illegal and annulled the resolutions. In a compromise, the ayuntamiento (city council) of San Antonio de Béxar drafted a new petition with similar language to the convention resolutions and submitted it through proper legal channels. Músquiz forwarded the new document to the Mexican Congress. Background In 1821 several of Spain's former colonies in the New World won their independence and banded together to create a new country, Mexico. The Constitution of 1824 established Mexico as a federalist republic comprising multiple states. Sparsely populated former Spanish provinces were denied independent statehood and instead merged with neighboring areas. The former Spanish Texas, which marked Mexico's eastern border with the United States, was combined with Coahuila to form the new state Coahuila y Tejas. To assist in governing the large area, the state was subdivided into several departments; all of Texas was included in the Department of Béxar.Ericson (2000), p. 33. With the formation of a new state government, the Texas provincial governing committee was forced to disband,de la Teja (1997), p. 83. and the capital was moved from San Antonio de Béxar to Saltillo.Edmondson (2000), p. 72. Many Tejanos—native Mexican citizens who lived in Texas—were reluctant to give up their self-rule. The bankrupt federal government was unable to provide much military assistance to the settlers in Texas, who faced frequent raids by native tribes. Hoping that an influx of settlers could control the raids, in 1824 the government appointed empresarios to encourage families from the United States and Europe to settle in Texas.Manchaca (2001), pp. 164, 187. However, as the number of settlers from the US and other non- Spanish-speaking areas increased in Texas, Mexican authorities became apprehensive that the United States might wish to annex the area, possibly using force.Henson (1982), pp. 47–8.Morton (1947), p. 33. On April 6, 1830, the Mexican government passed a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. The laws also canceled all unfilled empresario contracts and called for the first enforcement of customs duties. General alt=Lithograph depicting the head and shoulders of a middle-aged, clean-shaven man wearing an ostentatious military uniform. The new laws angered both Tejanos and recent immigrants (Texians).Davis (2006), p. 77. Stephen F. Austin, a well-respected empresario who had brought the first group of American settlers to Texas, warned Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante that the laws seemed designed to destroy the colonies.Davis (2006), p. 76. Texas's two delegates to the state legislature, both Tejanos, were so vocal in their opposition that one of them was expelled from the legislature. Austin was elected to fill his seat, and in December 1830 he left for Saltillo.Davis (2006), p. 78. Implementation of the laws led to much tension within Texas. Much to the displeasure of the colonists, a new military post was established in Anahuac to begin collecting customs duties. The commander of the post, Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn, often clashed with the locals over his strict interpretation of Mexican law. In June 1832, colonists armed themselves and marched on Anahuac. As a result of these Anahuac Disturbances, Bradburn was forced to resign.Henson (1982), pp. 95–102, 109. The small Texian rebellion coincided with a revolt led by General Antonio López de Santa Anna against Bustamante's centralist government.Davis (2006), p. 85. The chaos in the Mexican interior and the Texian success at Anahuac emboldened other Texas settlers to take arms against garrisons throughout eastern Texas.Henson (1982), p. 108. Within weeks, settlers expelled all Mexican soldiers from eastern Texas.Davis (2006), p. 86. Free from military oversight, the settlers began to increase their political activity.Davis (2006), p. 89. Meeting Buoyed by their success, Texians organized a political convention to persuade Mexican authorities to weaken the L830. On August 22, the ayuntamiento at San Felipe de Austin (the capital of Austin's colony) called for each district to elect five delegates.Gammel (1898), pp. 477–8. Although Austin attempted to dissuade the instigators, elections were held before his return from Saltillo. Sixteen communities chose delegates. The two municipalities with the largest Tejano population, San Antonio de Béxar and Victoria, refused to participate. The majority of the elected delegates were known as relatively even-tempered. Many known agitators, such as James Bowie and William B. Travis, were defeated.Davis (2006), p. 92. Tejanos did not have a large presence at the convention, largely due to the boycott by the Béxar and Victoria municipalities. Convention organizers invited several prominent Tejanos from these towns to attend, but all declined.Davis (2006), p. 91. alt=Portrait of a man with receding hairline and long sideburns, wearing an 1840s-style suit. On October 1, 1832, 55 delegates met in San Felipe de Austin; attendance may have been diminished due to the short notice.Gammel (1989), p. 478. The gathering marked the first time residents from each of the colonies had convened to discuss common goals. The convention was called to order by John Austin, one of the alcaldes of San Felipe de Austin.Gammel (1878), p. 480. In his remarks, John Austin laid out four key points that the convention needed to address: the \\"misrepresentations\\" made by \\"enemies of Texas\\" that the settlers desired independence from Mexico,quoted in Gammel (1898), p. 480. an appeal of the restrictions on immigration from the United States, a method to grant land titles to residents in certain areas of the province, and reduction of tariffs on many imported items.Gammel (1898), p. 481. The first order of business was the election of officers. Stephen F. Austin and William H. Wharton, a known hothead, were nominated to lead the convention; Austin won, 31–15. Frank W. Johnson, who had led the armed resistance at the Anahuac Disturbances, was elected secretary. In his acceptance speech, Austin praised the delegates for exerting their constitutional rights to petition the government. Over the next six days, the delegates adopted a series of resolutions requesting changes in the governance of Texas. Historian Eugene Campbell Barker suggests that the discussions would likely not have concluded so swiftly unless the delegates had done \\"considerable preparation before the meeting\\".Barker (1985), p. 349. Several of the resolutions were designed to stimulate the local economy. Delegates requested that customs duty enforcement be delayed until 1835 and that citizens be granted a method to remove corrupt customs officers. Resolutions encouraged that land titles be issued more quickly and that public lands be sold to raise money for bilingual schools. Delegates from Nacogdoches asked that the government take a firmer hand in preventing new settlers from encroaching on lands that had previously been promised to native tribes.. After explaining that law-abiding potential citizens were being excluded from Texas while disreputable squatters continued to stream illegally in, the delegates asked for the repeal of the prohibition on immigration from the United States. Furthermore, they requested permission to raise a militia, ostensibly for protection from marauding native tribes. The most controversial resolution asked that Texas become an independent state, separate from Coahuila. The separation request was added by a vote of 36–12. The motion included as justification the fact that Coahuila and Texas were very dissimilar in climate and economy and mentioned that Texas's limited representation in the state legislature made it very difficult to enact laws that specifically addressed the needs of its citizens.Barker (1985), p. 350. Delegates insisted that independent statehood was not a pretext for secession from Mexico. After approving the list of resolutions, delegates created a seven-member central committee to convene future meetings.The central committee was composed of Johnson, James B. Miller, Stephen F. Austin, Lewis Veeder, Robert Peebles, Wylie Martin, and William Pettis. (Gammel (1898), p. 496.) The central committee would be based in San Felipe \\"for the purpose of circulating information of events of importance to the interest of the people\\".quoted in Gammel (1898), p. 494. In addition, each municipality was asked to create a committee of correspondence and safety. The sub-committees would keep in close contact with the central committee because \\"united our strength and resources are more than adequate to our defense in any possible event. Disunited, we may become an easy prey, even to a handful of cowardly invaders.\\"quoted in Barker (1985), p. 351. The convention adjourned on October 6 after unanimously electing Wharton to deliver the resolutions to the state legislature in Saltillo and to the Mexican Congress in Mexico City.Davis (2006), p. 93.Gammel (1898), p. 500. Just before the group dispersed, Rafael Manchola, the alcalde (mayor) of Goliad, arrived. He was the only delegate from Goliad and the only Tejano to appear at the convention. Manchola volunteered to accompany Wharton at his own expense—he and other delegates thought the expedition might have more success if a Tejano was also involved.Huson (1974), p. 64. Days later, Austin wrote that \\"we have just had a convention of all Texas, native Mexicans and foreign settlers—all united as one man\\". Results Following the convention, much of the unrest in Texas subsided. Austin believed the public was calmed simply by having the opportunity to air their grievances. Before the list of concerns could be presented to the state and federal governments, Ramón Músquiz, the political chief, or head, of the Department of Béxar, ruled that the convention was illegal.Davis (2006), p. 94. This type of activism was traditionally forbidden in Texas.Neither Spain nor Mexico had allowed this type of activism.Winders (2004), p. 49. The law directed that citizens should protest to their local ayuntamiento (similar to a city council), which would forward their concerns to the political chief. The political chief could then escalate the concerns to the state or federal government. Because the colonists had not followed this process, Músquiz annulled their resolutions. The ayuntamientos at San Felipe, Nacogdoches, Gonzales and Liberty half-heartedly apologized for their participation, and Wharton's mission was cancelled.Barker (1985), p. 352. The lack of Tejano representation and the San Antonio de Béxar residents' refusal to participate fostered a perception that only newcomers to Texas were dissatisfied. Austin agreed to meet with the political leaders in San Antonio de Béxar to persuade them to support the resolutions. These Tejano leaders, including Erasmo Seguin, largely agreed with the result of the convention but opposed the methods by which the resolutions had been proposed. The Tejano leaders urged patience; Bustamante was still president and would not look favorably on a petition from Texas settlers who had sided with his rival, Santa Anna.Barker (1985), p. 351. Austin and the Tejano leaders agreed to a compromise. Because San Antonio de Béxar was the seat of the Department of Béxar, its ayuntamiento drafted a petition containing similar language to the convention resolutions. The petition was endorsed by the ayuntamientos at Goliad, San Felipe, and NacogdochesDavis (2006), p. 95. and then given to Músquiz, who forwarded it to the Mexican Congress in early 1833. Although Músquiz had publicly supported the petition, he secretly included a note to the Coahuila y Tejas governor warning that this might be a precursor to secession.Barker (1985), pp. 351–352. The political leaders also agreed to Austin's stipulation that if the federal government refused to address the petition within several months, Texas residents would form their own state government, essentially declaring independence from Coahuila, if not from Mexico. The central committee elected by the convention was too impatient to wait long. In late December, the committee called for a March election for delegates to the Convention of 1833. The second convention reiterated some of the previous concerns and took additional steps to declare Texas an independent state, further concerning Mexican authories, who feared this was a step towards Texas joining the United States.Vazquez (1997), p. 67. The Mexican government attempted to address some of the concerns identified by the conventions of 1832 and 1833. In November 1833, part of the Laws of April 6, 1830 were repealed, allowing Americans to immigrate legally to Texas.Vazquez (1997), p. 68. Several months later, Texas was granted increased representation in the Coahuila y Tejas legislature. Several American legal concepts, such as trial by jury, were introduced to Texas, and English was authorized as a second language.Vazquez (1997), p. 69. Unimpressed with these compromises, some Texas residents continued to campaign for independent statehood. Rising tensions eventually led to the Texas Revolution, which began in October 1835.Vazquez (1997), p. 72.

They disbanded in 1979 leaving only bootleg recordings and demos, now extremely rare. In late 1983, Bonney traveled to London and in 1985 he formed a new version of the group in the U.K. which included members of the recently disbanded The Birthday Party; later they transferred to Berlin, where they issued four albums – Room of Lights (1986), Shine (1988), The Bride Ship (1989) and Paradise Discotheque (1990) – before disbanding again in 1991. In 2012 Bonney reformed the band in Detroit with two veterans of its Berlin era and a handful of new members. Critic David Sheridan described the band's music as characterized by slow tempos, dark moods and Bonney's forlorn vocals, all of which can range from \\"endurance testing\\" at worst to \\"hauntingly beautiful\\" at best. History Crime & the City Solution are an Australian rock group which formed in late 1977 in Sydney with a line-up of Simon Bonney on lead vocals, Phil Kitchener on bass guitar, Dave MacKinnon on saxophone, Don McLennan (ex-Particles) on drums and Harry Zantey on guitar. The group has had five distinct line-ups with Bonney as the only mainstay: Sydney in 1977–78, Melbourne in 1979, two groupings in Berlin from 1985 to 1990, and Detroit from 2012 onwards. In the late 1970s Bonney had met McLennan and sometimes provided guest vocals for McLennan's group, The Particles. According to Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, The Particles had \\"a cult following around the inner-city Sydney scene courtesy of its delightful, melodious pop sound\\". In contrast, according to Peter Nelson of Pulp fanzine, Crime & the City Solution, used \\"An exciting blend of fuzzed monotone guitar runs and squawking saxophone riffs . . . [like] the drone songs on Wire's Pink Flag\\". In late 1978 Bonney and McLennan had relocated to Melbourne where they formed a new version of Crime & the City Solution with Chris Astley on keyboards, Kim Beissel on saxophone, Lindsay O'Meara on bass guitar (ex-Voigt/465) and Dan Wallace-Crabbe on guitar. In Melbourne Bonney became friends with local post-punk group, The Boys Next Door (later known as The Birthday Party). Crime & the City Solution broke up in 1979 after a number of live shows and recording an unreleased demo. Wallace-Crabbe later joined Laughing Clowns, O'Meara returned to Sydney and joined Pel Mel, Beissel played in → ↑ →, Astley and McLennan in other bands. In late 1983 Bonney moved to London and reconnected with members of The Birthday Party. In 1985 he formed another version of Crime & the City Solution in London with Mick Harvey on drums, keyboards and bass guitar and Rowland S. Howard on guitar and backing vocals. Howard's younger brother, Harry, soon joined on bass guitar. In June 1985 the group's debut four-track EP, The Dangling Man, was released by Mute Records in the UK and Possum Records in Australia. McFarlane found the EP provided \\"a gloomy, stripped-down, blues- flavoured sound\\". A six-track EP, Just South of Heaven, followed in September for UK release only. It was \\"cleaner, more powerful set of songs dominated by Bonney's dramatic vocals and chilling instrumentation\\". After the release Epic Soundtracks (aka Kevin Godfrey, ex-Swell Maps) joined on drums which freed Harvey to concentrate on keyboards and guitar. In 1986 Bronwyn Adams, Bonney's domestic partner, joined on violin and backing vocals. With the line-up of Adams, Bonney, Harvey, Rowland and Harry Howard, and Soundtracks, Crime & the City Solution recorded its debut album, Room of Lights, produced by the band, Flood and Tony Cohen. They recorded the album in Berlin. On 27 October 1986 it was released in the UK on Mute Records. Amy Hanson of Allmusic praised it as \\"rough and ready rock that slotted itself nicely under a gothic canvas – they were and remain post-punk's forgotten kings ... Its urgency jangles, its cacophony is dichotomous, and, at times, the underlying energy is breathtaking as the band storms through a great set\\". Late that year the Howard brothers and Soundtracks left to form their own group, These Immortal Souls. In 1987 Adams, Bonney and Harvey recruited Chrislo Haas (D.A.F., Liaisons Dangereuses) on synthesiser, Alexander Hacke (Einstürzende Neubauten) on guitar and Thomas Stern on bass guitar. In Australia in March 1988, Rampant Records issued a compilation, Room of Lights, with tracks from the UK releases, Just South of Heaven and Room of Lights. On 25 April that year Crime & the City Solution issued their second album, Shine, which Allmusic's Ned Raggett felt was \\"a touch less classically smooth and arranged, more rough around the edges and jagged, especially with Bonney's delivery ... his lyrics come across as distinctly unfriendly to a usual verse/chorus structure, sounding like a spoken-word recitation sung a line at a time\\". In November Craig Lee described their performance at Bogart's for the Los Angeles Times, \\"For what is purportedly a loosely structured outfit, this group displayed a remarkable cohesiveness. At times the band has the earthy feel of both old blues and country sounds and the slightly mystical aura of the early Doors. But rather than rehash time-worn styles, the Solution translates these forms into its own introspective idioms\\". On 17 April 1989 Crime & the City Solution released their third album, The Bride Ship, for which Raggett found them \\"continue carving its own strange path. ... Harvey doubtless contributes most of the organ work. Simon Bonney continues to evolve into more of his own man – if anything, he's embracing country and western more explicitly in his singing style\\". The Bride Ship was issued in Australia by BMG and Arista Records. Alternative rocker Mark Lanegan cites Shine as one of his favourite albums, \\"[it] is succinct and is great from start to finish. There’s a great sense of space on this record that’s fantastic but the thing that I’m most drawn to is the melancholy on some of those songs. But it also has a cinematic quality\\". On 3 September 1990 Crime & the City Solution's fourth studio album, Paradise Discotheque, appeared. It had been recorded between November 1989 to March 1990 and was produced by Haas. The group disbanded late in 1991 and on 4 October 1993 a live album, The Adversary – Live, was released. By 1991 Bonney had moved to Los Angeles where he released two solo albums, Forever (1992) and Everyman (1994). In late 2011, Bonney was based in Detroit and announced that Crime & the City Solution would re-form to record a new album for Mute Records in 2012. Personnel are Bonney, Adams, Hacke, David Eugene Edwards (of US bands 16 Horsepower and Woven Hand), Detroit musician Troy Gregory, Matthew Smith, Jim White (of the Australian group Dirty Three), and Danielle de Picciotto (married to Hacke). Recording occurred in Detroit.

Fine, 1986) #Rasputin's Revenge (Donald I. Fine, 1987) Lescroart's most popular works are a series of legal and crime dramas taking place in and around San Francisco, beginning with the thriller Dead Irish. They center around the adventures of ex-cop and lawyer, Dismas Hardy, and his best friend, officer Abe Glitsky, among many other friends and associates. His newest works introduce Wyatt Hunt, working as a private investigator. Although they are often performing together in the story, the books can be distinguished by which character is the main protagonist. Hardy's daughter, Rebecca, first appears as the main character in the novel The Fall, following her graduation from law school and joining Hardy's law firm as an associate attorney. =Dismas Hardy (featured protagonist)= #Dead Irish (Donald I.

In countries with chronic inflation, inflation expectations become 'built-in', and it becomes extremely difficult to reduce the inflation rate because the process of reducing inflation by, for example, slowing down the growth rate of the money supply, will often lead to high unemployment until inflationary expectations have adjusted to the new situation. Chronic inflation is distinct from hyperinflation. Occurrence Even more so than hyperinflation, chronic inflation is a 20th-century phenomenon, being first observed by Felipe Pazos in 1972.Pazos, Felipe; Chronic Inflation in Latin America (Präger Special Studies in International Economics and Development); High inflation can only be sustained with unbacked paper currencies over long periods, and before World War II unbacked paper currencies were rare except in countries affected by war – which often produced extremely high inflation but never for more than a few years. Most economists believe chronic inflation first emerged in Latin America following World War II, with the result that it was originally called \\"Latin inflation\\".Maier, Charles S.; In Search of Stability: Explorations in Historical Political Economy; pp. 206–210. Some economists, however, argue that the experience of France in the 1920s was the first case of chronic inflation.Hirsch, Fred and Goldthorpe, John H.; The Political Economy of Inflation; pp. 53–55. Japan (see below) in the years surrounding World War II is another case with characteristics very akin to well-studied cases of chronic inflation. Causes Monetarists state that chronic inflation is caused by chronic growth of the money supply, a position that is accepted by most mainstream economists. The causes alleged below are then things that cause the monetary authority to chronically engage in monetary growth. Early observers from the 1960s and 1970s attributed the ultimate political cause of chronic inflation as powerful group interests with radically divergent policy demands, arguing that the power of labour unions to demand high wages for workers in frequently outdated economic sectors conflicted with the basically feudal political structures of affected countries.Maier; In Search of Stability; pp. 205 & 208 Under these conditions, a return to a commodity money that would curb inflation quickly is politically suicidal, with the result that governments affected by chronic inflation have invariably had to resort to more subtle methods of reducing inflation, such as central bank reforms or indexing price and wage levels to the future value of money. This, however, leads to inflation inertiaAgénor, Pierre-Richard; The Economics of Adjustment and Growth; pp. 209–210. and ultimately to a public that becomes skeptical of attempts to reduce inflation: unlike hyperinflation, history has shown that it is possible for communities to live with moderate chronic inflation relatively easily. Other sources have argued that chronic inflation is caused by governments seeking to optimize seignorage taxes in order to pay most efficiently for public programmes, or because the societies in which it developed have consistently imported more than they can export and their currencies have had to devalue consistently to make their imports more expensive without elasticity being sufficient to reduce demand.INFLATION, CHRONIC INFLATION There have on this line also been arguments for demographic causes of chronic inflation as resulting from populations growing more rapidly than production in developing nations from the 1950s to the 1980s, and until today in sub-Saharan Africa. Increasingly it is also thought that environmental or ecological stresses and disasters can trigger a period of systemic inflation by governments unable to effectively handle the situation. ExamplesArgentina= The Argentine economy has a long history of experiencing trouble with prolonged high inflation rates. In 1989, Argentina experienced a hyperinflation crisis as a result of bad economic policies, which led to an inflation rate of 257%. The hyperinflation crisis caused protests, riots, looting and a general decline of the government popularity among the public. This hyperinflation crisis had also taken place in the middle of the presidential elections, which led to the governing party to lose the elections. During the 1990s, thanks to the convertibility plan, which pegged the austral (and, afterward, the peso) to the United States Dollar value, inflation rates decreased nearly to 0%. These policies ended with a catastrophic economic crisis in 2001. During the 21st century, Argentina didn't experience real inflationary troubles until 2007, which saw a rise in inflation rates. During Cristina Kirchner's government, inflation rates were at an all-time high, with the highest inflation rates experienced in 2013, which saw a rise of the inflation rate to 30% to 40%. This was compensated, albeit partly, with high purchasing power and subsidization, the latter increasing the fiscal deficit. In December 2015, Mauricio Macri assumed the presidency of the nation, with a 40% inflation from Cristina Kirchner's presidency. When 2016 ended, inflation was in a recent of 42%. The Argentine Ministry of Economy had put in action a project that claimed to reduce inflation from 40% to 20% (+/- 2%) in 2017, to 10% (+/- 2%) in 2018 and to 5% (+/- 1%) in 2019. The project initially led to 24% inflation in 2017, but it did not work in 2018, with an inflation rate of 47.6%, and in 2019, inflation was 53%. =Bulgaria= In 1996, the Bulgarian economy collapsed due to the slow and mismanaged economic reforms of several governments in a row, shortages of wheat, and an unstable and decentralized banking system, which led to an inflation rate of 311% and the collapse of the lev, with the exchange rate to dollars reaching 3000. When pro-reform forces came into power in the spring 1997, an ambitious economic reform package, including introduction of a currency board regime and pegging the Bulgarian Lev to the German Deutsche Mark (and subsequently to the euro), was agreed to with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and the economy began to stabilize. =Chile= Chile had prolonged inflation for the greater part of the twentieth century.Christ, Carl P.; Measurement in Economics: Studies in Mathematical Economics and Econometrics; p. 219. Inflation first became persistent at the tail end of the 1930s as the government began a process of import substitution, rising steady to 84 percent in 1955.Geddes, Barbara; Paradigms and Sand Castles: Theory Building and Research Design in Comparative Politics (Analytical Perspectives on Politics); p. 121. After slowing in the late 1950s, inflation rose again under Allende and peaked anywhere between 500% and 1,000% in late 1973 (which some consider hyperinflation, though the monthly inflation rate reached 30% for a single monthInflation Chile 1973). A 1973 coup d'état deposed Allende and installed a military government led by Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet's free-market economic policy gradually ended chronic inflation, which stabilised in single figures for the first time in forty-five years. Overall impact of chronic inflation: 1 current peso = 1,000,000 pre-1960 pesos. =Guinea= Guinea has seen year on year inflation rates hover well above 50% since the late 1990s, though many months have seen much lower levels in the single digits. In Guinea the normal drivers of inflation are food supply and distribution, and global commodity prices. Political instability has also contributed greatly to the fall in the Guinean franc's value in recent years due to a series of coups following the ouster of longtime military strongman Lansana Conté and mass protests. Some government mitigation policies and economic growth have progressively stabilized inflation rates which reached their peak in July 2005 at 42.6% for the month to a current average of 9.7% per month. On 21 July 2010, Yahoo! Finance quoted the rate as 5,050 GNF to 1 USD. , the exchange rate was 7,023 GNF to 1 USD. =Israel= Inflation accelerated in the 1970s, rising steadily from 13% in 1971 to 111% in 1979. From 133% in 1980, it leaped to 191% in 1983 and then to 445% in 1984, threatening to become a four-digit figure within a year or two. In 1985 Israel froze most prices by law and enacted other measures as part of an economic stabilization plan. That same year, inflation more than halved, to 185%. Within a few months, the authorities began to lift the price freeze on some items; in other cases it took almost a year. By 1986, inflation was down to 19%. =Iraq= Years of constant war and rebuilding resulted in large amounts of government spending, with international sanctions creating shortages and limits on borrowing. Between 1987 and 1995 the Iraqi Dinar went from an official value of 0.306 Dinars/USD (or US$3.26 per dinar; the black market rate is thought to have been substantially fewer dinars per dollar) to 3000 Dinars/USD due to government loss of their Swiss printing press and the printing of inferior quality notes. This equates to approximately 315% inflation per year averaged over that eight-year period.History page at the Central Bank of Iraq http://cbi.iq/index.php?pid=History =Japan= As Hirohito prepared for war to gain access to rubber and mineral resources, Japan began experiencing steady inflation from 1934. By the end of 1949, retail prices were more than 150 times their level in 1939, and the highest denomination was a 75,000,000,000 Yen bank cheque. The Japan wholesale price index (relative to 1 as the average of 1930) shot up to 16.3 in 1943, 127.9 in 1948 and 342.5 in 1951. In the early 1950s, after the end of US military occupation, Japan controlled its own money. Through its rapidly growing export trade, Japan stabilized the yen quickly. =Laos= Starting in the late 1980s financial aid and trade with the USSR greatly decreased, which began a two- decade long period of high inflation that began to accelerate by 1996 with the East Asian financial crisis which had severely impacted Laos, burdened with large amounts of foreign debt coupled with very slow growth. By January 1998 inflation had reached 100% a month and did not dip below that level again until late 1999, after it had peaked well above 167%. For a short time the Lao kip gained the less than respectable title of being \\"least valued currency unit.\\" Although the kip has officially returned to lower inflation levels the local inflation rates remain much higher, spurred on by rising food and import prices. The emergence of a new debt crisis in 2013 has brought more uncertainty. =Madagascar= The Malagasy franc (iraimbilanja) had a turbulent time in 2004, losing nearly half its value and sparking rampant inflation. On 1 January 2005, the ariary, worth five francs, became the main currency unit in Madagascar. In May 2005, there were riots over rising inflation. Disinflation calmed the situation from 2005 to 2008, but riots ensued in 2009 as prices continued to rise.Deaths as thousands riot in Madagascar =Mexico= In spite of the oil crisis of the late 1970s (Mexico is a producer and exporter), and due to excessive social spending, Mexico defaulted on its external debt in 1982. As a result, the country suffered a severe case of capital flight and over a decade of chronic inflation and peso devaluation. In 1984, the highest denomination was 10,000 pesos , by 1991 it was 100,000 pesos and many Mexicans took to putting their savings into dollars. On 1 January 1993, Mexico created a new currency, the nuevo peso (\\"new peso\\", or MXN), which chopped 3 zeros off the old peso, an inflation rate of 10,000% over the decade of the crisis. (One new peso was equal to 1000 of the obsolete MXP pesos). The actual highest denomination was 1,000 pesos, worth 1,000,000 old pesos. =Mozambique= Mozambique was one of the world's poorest and most underdeveloped countries when it became independent of Portugal in 1975, the last colonial power to relinquish its African territories. A brutal civil war between the communist government and rebel forces from 1977 to 1992 led to continuous inflation. The highest denomination in 1976 was 100 meticais. By 2004, it was 500,000 meticais. In the 2006 currency reform, 1 new metical was exchanged for 1,000 old meticais. =North Korea= Though the North Korean Won, officially called the Korean People's won (KPW) never technically failed it had been steadily devalued since 2002 when the dollar peg was removed. During a 2009 revaluation, the government gave citizens seven days to turn in their old won for new won – with 1,000 old worth 10 of the new – but allowed a maximum exchange of only 150,000 of the old won. That meant each adult could legally exchange about US$740-worth of won. The exchange cap wiped out the savings of many North Koreans, and reportedly caused unrest in parts of the country. Many of the exchange and time limits for conversion were either dropped or extended after prices soared over 1000% in some regions in the first week as people rushed to buy as much things as they could. According to a September 2009 BBC report,“North Korea currency change sparks panic” some department stores in Pyongyang even stopped accepting North Korean won, instead insisting upon payment in U.S. dollars, Chinese renminbi, euros, or even Japanese yen. =Syria= The Syrian Civil War and has resulted in a substantial capital fight of Syrian goods and services to nearby Arab countries. Before the war, the exchange rate was remarkably stable; one U.S. dollar was quoted at 47 Syrian pounds. , profound effects of the Syrian Civil War to the Syrian economy reduced the value of the Syrian pound to less than one thousandth of a U.S. dollar in the black market, representing a devaluation of 96% since the start of the war. Between 1 January and 16 January 2020, the Syrian pound lost a quarter of its value relative to the U.S. dollar, from 900 SYP/USD to 1200 SYP/USD. Further compounding the problem, the use of currencies other than Syrian pounds in any transaction is forbidden under Syrian law, and on 18 January 2020, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad increased the penalty for unauthorised use of foreign currency anywhere in Syria to seven years of hard labour. Despite the law, Syrians continue to resort to hard currencies such as U.S. dollars or euros to maintain their purchasing power. =Turkey= Throughout the 1990s Turkey dealt with severe inflation rates that finally crippled the economy into a recession in 2001. The highest denomination in 1995 was 1,000,000 lira. By 2005 it was 20,000,000 lira. Recently Turkey has achieved single digit inflation for the first time in decades, and in the 2005 currency reform, introduced the New Turkish Lira; 1 was exchanged for 1,000,000 old lira. =Uzbekistan= Uzbekistan has perpetually experienced high inflation since the time of independence. In 1994 the highest denomination available was 100 som, the current highest is 5000 som with a face value of roughly $2.00 as of 2014 and large bundles of currency are required for any substantial purchase, with most prices rounded off to the nearest thousand. =Venezuela= Venezuela has a legacy of multiple inflation crisis linked to mismanagement and lack of economic diversification, with the largest and longest period starting in the 1980s and through the 90s during which inflation peaked in 1996 with 60% in January to an all-time high of 118.8% in July of that same year. Revenue from petroleum exports accounts for more than 50% of the country's GDP and roughly 95% of total exports, and after decades of some of the strongest economic growth in South America the trend went into sharp reversal as oil prices began their steady drop following the end of the oil crisis of the 1970s of which both OPEC member and non-member producers had benefited greatly from. This period of economic contraction in Venezuela coincided with the beginning of the 1980s oil glut, which saw large cutbacks in production and state revenue. Since the early 2000s the administration of Hugo Chavez responded to the ongoing crisis by initiating a series of often flawed price controls, state acquisition and reappropriation of both public and private assets and funds, and a revaluation of the bolivar in 2008 which slashed three zeroes off the currency. However, changes in economic reliance on petroleum and mining exports were never made and Venezuela remained vulnerable to global supply and demand of these exports and continued to experience systemic economic problems and a return to high inflation. As of January 2014, Venezuela had the highest inflation rate in the world at 56.2% and 63.4% as of August 2014, though official numbers are stated to be much lower. The national economy has contracted for three consecutive quarters officially putting the country in recession while a global crash in oil prices crimp revenue and contribute to fears of a potential default which could bring inflation levels even higher.http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-venezuela- enters-recession-inflation-tops-63-2014-12 =Zambia= Falling copper prices, the oil crisis, and failed economic management in the 1970s led to shortfalls and severe economic crisis in Zambia by the early 80s, instigating a nationwide famine and forcing the government to borrow massive amounts of money and commit to extreme IMF economic reforms which led to anti-government riots and the devaluation of the kwacha. Inflation held around 15% in the 1980s until hitting 54% in 1988, to 191% in 1992, and 183% in 1993, compounded further by a prolonged drought. A \\"cash-budgeting system\\" and free market reforms brought inflation down to 55% in 1994, and 25% in 1998.

It ran for three seasons. On Australia Day 2006, a Life Support Marathon was shown on the Comedy Channel showing the first series and half of the second. Concept A satirical, sometimes dark look at Australian life as seen through the omnipresent lens of the Television Lifestyle Show. The series' lifestyle experts included Sigourney, a home economics guru who always wore a fresh frock and was a firm believer in the doctrine of \\"pleasing your man\\"; Todd, a DIY expert; Rudi, a South African general practitioner; and young person Penne. Much of the show's humour derived from political incorrectness and black humour. For example: Penne explains that roadside tributes are an ideal place to get fresh flowers; Dr Rudi endorses fattening up one's daughter to prevent boys from wanting to have sex with her because \\"It's better to have a fatty boombah in the family than a filthy slut\\"; Sigourney recommends that if you have a bad haircut, shave your head and tell your friends that you have had chemotherapy. One feature of the series were voxpop interviews with real people about topics raised in the show, which often supported the stereotypes and attitudes voiced by the characters. Characters * Penne - an independent, often aggressive, stereotypical university student-style young woman, always trying to find a way to make quick money and make life easier for overwhelmed young adults. Played by Abbie Cornish (season 1) and Alison Barnes (seasons 2-3). * Sigourney - a ditzy blond young woman and stereotype from the North Shore of Sydney whose segments were dedicated to the art of landing a wealthy husband. Played by Rachael Coopes. * Todd - a parody of 'do it yourself' home-handymen blokes. Played by Brendan Cowell (seasons 1-2) and Duncan Fellows (season 3). * Dr Rudi - an amoral South African doctor with a strong Afrikaner accent, who is a parody of doctors found in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. His catchphrase is \\"Howzit, Dr Rrrrudi here\\". Played by Simon Van Der Stap (seasons 1-3) and Jack Finsterer (season 3). Dr Rudi vs Dr Rudi Throughout the third series, there were various hints that the new Dr Rudi, who was explained as having surgery, was actually an imposter. During the usual letter time, instead of answering mail, they would instead continue the plot that the old Dr Rudi was out for revenge, and to get his life back. During the final scene of the last episode of the series, Sigourney and Dr Rudi's (Jack Finsterer) wedding was taking place, and from behind the bushes came the original Dr Rudi (Simon Van Der Stap) to try to end the wedding. The pair got into an argument over which Dr Rudi Sigourney would marry, and they started a fist fight. This led to the closing credits. As no episodes of Life Support have been made since, this plot has never been resolved. DVD release All 3 series of Life Support have been released on DVD.

It grows in coastal New South Wales, Australia. First described in 1793 by James Edward Smith, he gave the new species the name Embothrium buxifolium. It is widely cultivated and contains a number of subspecies and cultivars. These vary most in the presentation of the attractive flower. The species forms a short shrub, three or four feet high. The numerous branches are covered in a reddish or brown hair and many leaves. Flowers sit at the termination of these: yellowish and white, pendulous star- shaped petals, set to appear in November. The flowers of the plant sit alone, erect in umbels, on stalks covered in reddish brown hairs. The corolla is likewise clothed and is partly fused to form a cavity. This interior is white and the petals are otherwise very pale to yellow; this spills above the hairy parts. The single elliptic leaves are veiny, with a very rough dark green upper; margins entire and roll to the downy underside. These are arranged, almost directly to the stem, alternate and numerous up the branches. They end in a little sharp point.

Early life and education Maria Yudina was born to a Jewish family in Nevel, Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire. She was the fourth child of Veniamin Yudin, a renowned physiologist and forensic expert, and his first wife, Raisa Yakovlevna Yudina (née Zlatina; 1868-1918). Yudina studied at the Petrograd Conservatory under Anna Yesipova and Leonid Nikolayev. She also briefly studied privately with Felix Blumenfeld. Her classmates included Dmitri Shostakovich and Vladimir Sofronitsky. In 1921-22 Yudina attended lectures at the historical-philological department of Petrograd University and, as a result, completed studies in theology after she had already converted from Judaism to the Orthodox Christian faith in 1919. Career After her graduation from the Petrograd Conservatory, Yudina was invited to teach there, which she did until 1930, when she was thrown out of the institution because of her religious convictions and vocal criticism of the Soviet leadership. After being unemployed and homeless for a couple of years, Yudina was invited to teach the graduate piano course at the Tbilisi State Conservatory in 1932-33\\\\. In 1936, on Heinrich Neuhaus's suggestion, Yudina joined the piano faculty of the Moscow Conservatory, where she taught until 1951. From 1944 to 1960 Yudina taught chamber ensemble and vocal class at the Gnessin Institute (now Gnessin Russian Academy of Music). In 1960 Yudina was thrown out of the Gnessin Institute because of her religious attitudes and advocacy of modern Western music. She continued to perform in public, but her recitals were forbidden to be recorded. After an incident during one of her recitals in Leningrad, when she read Boris Pasternak's poetry from the stage as an encore, Yudina was banned from performing for five years. In 1966, when the ban was lifted, she gave a cycle of lectures on Romanticism at the Moscow Conservatory. According to an otherwise unsubstantiated story in Solomon Volkov's book Testimony, which claims to represent the memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich, one night in 1944 Stalin heard a performance of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 on the radio performed by Yudina, and asked for a copy. It was a live broadcast so officials woke up Yudina, drove her to a recording studio where a small orchestra had quickly been assembled, and made her record the concerto in the middle of the night; a single copy was pressed from the matrix and given to Stalin. In another apocryphal story, she was awarded the Stalin Prize and donated its monetary portion to the Russian Orthodox Church for prayers for Stalin's sins. But the existing recording of the Mozart concerto with Alexander Gauk dates from 1948, so the date 1943/1944 could be wrong. Yudina remained an uncompromising critic of the Soviet regime. She died in Moscow in 1970. Yudina's playing was marked by great virtuosity, spirituality, strength and intellectual rigor, with a highly idiosyncratic style and tone. Sviatoslav Richter said of her playing: > She was immensely talented and a keen advocate of the music of her own time: > she played Stravinsky, whom she adored, Hindemith, Krenek and Bartók at a > time when these composers were not only unknown in the Soviet Union but > effectively banned. And when she played Romantic music, it was > impressive—except that she didn't play what was written. Liszt's Weinen und > Klagen was phenomenal, but Schubert's B-flat major Sonata, while arresting > as an interpretation, was the exact opposite of what it should have been, > and I remember a performance of the Second Chopin Nocturne that was so > heroic that it no longer sounded like a piano but a trumpet. It was no > longer Schubert or Chopin, but Yudina.Monsaingeon, B. (2001). Sviatoslav > Richter. Notebooks and Conversations. Faber & Faber Ltd. pp. 48–52 Among her friends were Boris Pasternak (who did the first reading of his novel Doctor Zhivago at Yudina's apartment as early as February 1947), Osip Mandelstam, Mikhail Bakhtin, Pierre Suvchinsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Thanks to the efforts of Yudina's friends in Russia, particularly Anatoly Kuznetsov, Yudina's letters and writings were published in the late 1990s and early 2000s. There were several attempts to complete the set of Yudina's recordings. In fiction Yudina was portrayed as a character in Aleksei Losev's novel Woman as Thinker. The flawed heroine Losev created was a woman musician who spouted philosophy but held herself to lower standards. The novel has been criticized as an outlet for Losev's difficult relationship with Yudina, and as a poor example of his capabilities as a writer. She was offended by the book, and ended their friendship in 1934. In 1989 David Zane Mairowitz wrote The Stalin Sonata, a radio drama loosely based on an encounter between Stalin and Yudina. It won a Giles Cooper Award.

Biography  Plaque honouring Viger in Vauquelin Square Viger was born in Montreal, the son of Jacques Viger who represented Kent in the 2nd Parliament of Lower Canada, and studied at the Sulpician college of Montreal. On November 17, 1808 he married Marie Marguerite La Corne, daughter of Luc de la Corne, and widow of Major the Hon. John Lennox. They had three children, all of whom died in infancy. After his studies he went to Quebec, where he worked as an editor of the newspaper Le Canadien from November 1808 to May 1809. Viger served as captain in the Canadian Voltigeurs unit under Charles de Salaberry during the War of 1812. He was elected the first mayor of Montreal in 1833 and worked to improve its sanitary conditions. Although he wrote little, his reputation as an archaeologist was universal, and the greatest contemporary historians of France and the United States have drawn from his collection of manuscripts, based on forty years of research. He compiled a chronicle under the title of \\"Sabretache\\" (28 vols.), wherein he gathered plans, maps, portraits, and valuable notes illustrating many contested historical points. He was the founder of the Historical Society of Montreal in 1857, one year before his death. Pope Pius IX honoured him with the knighthood of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. He died December 12, 1858 at age 71 and was buried in the crypt of the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Church on December 15.  Honours  The Viger Square and Jacques Viger Building in Montreal are named in his honour.

It includes clinical study and treatment of sleep disorders and irregularities. Sleep medicine is a subset of somnology. History After the invention of the EEG, the stages of sleep were determined in 1936 by Harvey and Loomis, the first descriptions of delta and theta waves were made by Walter and Dovey, and REM sleep was discovered in 1953. Sleep apnea was identified in 1965.Bradley DT. Respiratory Sleep Medicine. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 2008. Vol 117. In 1970, the first clinical sleep laboratory was developed at Stanford.Bowman TJ. Review of Sleep Medicine. Burlington, MA: Butterworth- Heinemann, 2002. The first actigraphy device was made in 1978 by Krupke, and continuous positive airway pressure therapy and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty were created in 1981. The Examination Committee of the Association of Sleep Disorders Centers, which is now the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, was established in 1978 and administered the sleep administration test until 1990. In 1989, the American Board of Sleep Medicine was created to administer the tests and eventually assumed all the duties of the Examination committee in 1991. In the United States, the American Board of Sleep Medicine grants certification for sleep medicine to both physicians and non-physicians. However, the board does not allow one to practice sleep medicine without a medical license. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders Created in 1990 by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (with assistance from European Sleep Research Society, the Japanese Society of Sleep Research, and the Latin American Sleep Society), the International Classification of Sleep Disorders is the primary reference for scientists and diagnosticians. Sleep disorders are separated into four distinct categories: parasomnias; dyssomnias; sleep disorders associated with mental, neurological, or other medical conditions; and sleep disorders that do not have enough data available to be counted as definitive sleep disorders. The ICSD has created a comprehensive description for each sleep disorder with the following information.\\"The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Revised: Diagnostic and Coding Manual\\". 2001 edition, , PDF-complete, Library of Congress Catalog No. 97-71405. . *Synonyms and Key Words – This section describes the terms and phrases used to describe the disorder and also includes an explanation on the preferred name of the disorder when appropriate. *Essential Features – This section describes the main symptoms and features of the disorder. *Associated Features – This section describes the features that appear often but not always present. Furthermore, complications that are caused directly by the disorder are listed here. *Course – This section describes the clinical course and the outcome of an untreated disorder. *Predisposing Factors – This section describes internal and external factors that increase the chances of a patient developing the sleep disorder. *Prevalence – This section, if known, describes the proportion of people who have or had this disorder. *Age of Onset – This section describes the age range when the clinical features first appear. *Sex Ratio – This section describes the relative frequency that the disorder is diagnosed in each sex. *Familial Pattern – This section describes whether the disorder is found among family members. *Pathology – This section describes the microscopic pathologic features of the disorder. If this is not known, the pathology of the disorder is described instead. *Complications – This section describes any possible disorders or complications that can occur because of the disease. *Polysomnographic Features – This section describes how the disorder appears under a polysomnograph. *Other Laboratory Features - This section describes other laboratory test such as blood tests and brain imaging. *Differential Diagnosis – This section describes disorders with similar symptoms. *Diagnostic Criteria – This section has the criteria that can make a clear-cut diagnosis. *Minimal Criteria – This section is used for general clinical practice and is used to make a provisional diagnosis. *Severity Criteria – This section has a three-part classification into “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” and also describes the criteria for the severity. *Duration Criteria – This section allows a clinician to determine how long a disorder has been present and separates the durations into “acute,” “subacute,” and “chronic. *Bibliography – This section contains the references. Diagnostic tools Somnologists employ various diagnostic tools to determine the nature of a sleep disorder or irregularity. Some of these tools can be subjective such as the sleep diaries or the sleep questionnaire. Other diagnostic tools are used while the patient is asleep such as the polysomnograph and actigraphy. =Sleep diaries= A sleep diary is a daily log made by the patient that contains information about the quality and quantity of sleep. The information includes sleep onset time, sleep latency, number of awakenings in a night, time in bed, daytime napping, sleep quality assessment, use of hypnotic agents, use of alcohol and cigarettes, and unusual events which may influence a person's sleep. Such a log is usually made for one or two weeks before visiting a somnologist. The sleep diary may be used in conjunction with actigraphy. =Sleep questionnaires= Sleep questionnaires help determine the presence of a sleep disorder by asking a patient to fill out a questionnaire about a certain aspect of their sleep such as daytime sleepiness. These questionnaires include the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and the Sleep Timing Questionnaire. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale measures general sleep propensity and asks the patient to rate their chances of dozing off in eight different situations. The Stanford Sleepiness Scale asks the patient to note their perception of sleepiness by using a seven-point test. The Sleep Timing Questionnaire is a 10-minute self- administration test that can be used in place of a 2-week sleep diary. The questionnaire can be a valid determinate of sleep parameters such as bed time, wake time, sleep latency, and wake after sleep onset.R. Tremaine, J. Dorrian and S. Blunden. Measuring Sleep Habits using the Sleep Timing Questionnaire: A Validation Study for School-Age Children. Sleep and Biological Rhythms. 2010 Volume 8. =Actigraphy= Actigraphy can assess sleep/wake patterns without confining one to the laboratory. The monitors are small, wrist-worn movement monitors that can record activity for up to several weeks. Sleep and wakefulness are determined by using an algorithm that analyzes the movement of the patient and the input of bed and wake times from a sleep diary. =Physical examination= A physical examination can determine the presence of other medical conditions that can cause a sleep disorder. =Polysomnography= Polysomnography involves the continuous monitoring of multiple physiological variables during sleep. These variables include electroencephalography, electrooculography, electromyography, and electrocardiography as well as airflow, oxygenation, and ventilation measurements. Electroencephalography measures the voltage activity of neuronal somas and dendrites within the cortex, electro-oculography measures the potential between cornea and retina, electromyography is used to identify REM sleep by measuring the electrical potential of skeletal muscle, and electrocardiography measures cardiac rate and rhythm. It is important to point out that EEG, in particular, always refers to a collective of neurons firing as EEG equipment is not sensitive enough to measure a single neuron. Airflow measurements Airflow measurement can be used to indirectly determine the presence of an apnea; measurements are taken by pneumotachography, nasal pressure, thermal sensors, and expired carbon dioxide. Pneumotachography measures the difference in pressure between inhalation and exhalation, nasal pressure can help determine the presence of airflow similar to pneumotachography, thermal sensors detect the difference in temperature between inhaled and exhaled air, and expired carbon dioxide monitoring detect the difference in carbon dioxide between inhaled and exhaled air. Oxygenation and ventilation measurements The monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is important in the assessment of sleep-related breathing disorders. However, because oxygen values can change often during the course of sleep, repeated measurements must be taken to ensure accuracy. The direct measurements of arterial oxygen tension only offer a static glimpse, and repeated measurements from invasive procedures such as sampling arterial blood for oxygen will disturb the patient's sleep; therefore, noninvasive methods are preferred such as pulse oximetry, transcutaneous oxygen monitoring, transcutaneous carbon dioxide, and pulse transit time. Pulse oximetry measures the oxygenation in peripheral capillaries (such as the fingers); however, an article written by Bohning states that pulse oximetry may be imprecise for use in diagnosing obstructive sleep-apnea, due to the differences in signal processing in the devices.Bohning, N., Schultheiss, B., Eilers, S., Penzel, T., Bohning, W., et al. (2010). Comparability of Pulse Oximeters Used in Sleep Medicine for the Screening of OSA. Physiological Measurement, 31(7), 875-888. Transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide monitoring measure the oxygen and carbon dioxide tension on the skin surface respectively, and the pulse transit time measures the transmission time of an arterial pulse transit wave. For the lattermost, pulse transit time increases when one is aroused from sleep, making it useful in determining sleep apnea. =Snoring= Snoring can be detected by a microphone and may be a symptom of obstructive sleep-apnea.Migita, M., Gocho, Y., Ueda, T., Saigusa, H., & Fukunaga, Y. (2010). An 8-year-old Girl with a Recurrence of Obstructive Sleep Apnee Syndrome Caused by Hypertrophy of Tubal Tonsils 4 Years After Adenotonsillectomy. Journal of Nippon Medical School, 77(5), 265-268. =Multiple Sleep Latency Test= The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) measures a person's physiological tendency to fall asleep during a quiet period in terms of sleep latency, the amount of time it takes for someone. An MSLT is normally performed after a nocturnal polysomnography to ensure both an adequate duration of sleep and to exclude other sleep disorders.. J. Murray. A new perspective on sleepiness. Sleep and Biological Rhythms 2010; 8: 170–179 =Maintenance of Wakefulness Test= The Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) measures a person's ability to stay awake for a certain period of time, essentially measuring the time one can stay awake during the day. The test isolates a person from factors that can influence sleep such as temperature, light, and noise. Furthermore, the patient is also highly suggested to not take any hypnotics, drink alcohol, or smoke before or during the test. After allowing the patient to lie down on the bed, the time between lying down and falling asleep is measured and used to determine one's daytime sleepiness. Treatments Though somnology does not necessarily mean sleep medicine, somnologists can use behavioral, mechanical, or pharmacological means to correct a sleep disorder. =Behavioral treatments= Behavioral treatments tend to be the most prescribed and the most cost-efficient of all treatments; these treatments include exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation therapy, meditation, and improving sleep hygiene.Roehrs, T. (2009). Does Effective Management of Sleep Disorders Improve Pain Symptoms?. Drugs, 69, 5-11. Improving sleep hygiene includes making the patient sleep regularly, discourage the patient from taking daytime naps, or suggesting they sleep in a different position. =Mechanical treatments= Mechanical treatments are primarily used to reduce or eliminate snoring and can be either invasive or non-invasive. Surgical procedures for treating snoring include palatal stiffening techniques, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and uvulectomy while non- invasive procedures include continuous positive airway pressure, mandibular advancement splints, and tongue-retaining devices.Main, C., Liu, Z., Welch, K., Weiner, G., Jones, S., et al. (2009). Surgical Procedures and Non-surgical Devices for the Management of Non-apnoeic Snoring: A Systematic Review of Clinical Effects and Associated Treatment Costs. Clinical Otolaryngology, 34(3), 240-244. =Pharmacological treatments= Pharmacological treatments are used to chemically treat sleep disturbances such as insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness. The kinds of drugs used to treat sleep disorders include: anticonvulsants, anti-narcoleptics, anti-Parkinsonian drugs, benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, and opiates as well as the hormone melatonin and melatonin receptor stimulators. Anticonvulsants, opiates, and anti- Parkinsonian drugs are often used to treat restless legs syndrome. Furthermore, melatonin, benzodiazepines hypnotics, and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics may be used to treat insomnia. Finally, anti-narcoleptics help treat narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness. Of particular interest are the benzodiazepine drugs which reduce insomnia by increasing the efficiency of GABA. GABA decreases the excitability of neurons by increasing the firing threshold. Benzodiazepine causes the GABA receptor to better bind to GABA, allowing the medication to induce sleep.Sangameswaran, L., & Blas, A. (1985). Demonstration of Benzodiazepine-Like Molecules in the Mammalian Brain with a Monoclonal Antibody to Benzodiazepines. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 82(16), 5560-5564. Generally, these treatments are given after the behavioral treatment has failed. Drugs such as tranquilizers, though they may work well in treating insomnia, have a risk of abuse which is why these treatments are not the first resort. Some sleep disorders such as narcolepsy do require pharmacological treatment.

He was considered a usurper and tyrant, who was overthrown in a rebellion supported by the Parthian Empire.Crévier, p. 286Tomlins, p. 735 Life Rhadamistus was the eldest son of King Pharasmanes I of Iberia.Crévier, p. 280Toumanoff, p. 12Javakhishvili, p. 159 His mother was an unknown Armenian princess of the Artaxiad dynasty, who was the daughter of the Artaxiad Armenian monarchs Tigranes IV and his sister-wife Erato. Rhadamistus was known for his ambition, extraordinary strength, size of body, good looks and valor. Rhadamistus suffered impatiently an aged father's keeping him so long out of possession of the Kingdom of Iberia, which even if he had it, still seemed too small for satisfaction of his desires. Rhadamistus, by publicly talking about it in his audacious manner scared Pharasmanes as with his own declining years he feared usurpation by his son so he convinced Rhadamistus to make war upon his uncle, King Mithridates of Armenia.Crévier, pp. 280-281 Rhadamistus pretended that he was at feud with his father and stepmother and went to his uncle Mithridates. His uncle received Rhadamistus like a son and with an excessive kindness.Tacitus, XII, 44 Later as if he reconciled with his father he returned to Iberia, telling his father that everything was ready and that he must complete this affair by using his sword. Meanwhile, his father, Pharasmanes invented a pretext for war by recalling when he was fighting with the king of the Albanians and appealing to the Romans for help, his brother, had opposed him and he would now avenge him because of that. Pharasmanes gave his son a large Iberian army, who by a sudden invasion forced Mithridates to take shelter in the fortress of Gorneas, which was strongly garrisoned by the Romans under the command of Caelius Pollio, a camp-prefect, Casperius and a centurion.Tacitus, XII, 45Crévier, p. 282 Rhadamistus reminded his uncle of their tie of being relatives, of the seniority in age of his father, and how he himself was the father-in-law of him, as Rhadamistus was married on Mithridates' daughter Zenobia. Rhadamistus told him that the Iberians were not against peace and urged his uncle to conclude a treaty. Pharasmanes by secret messages had recommended Rhadamistus to hurry on the siege by all possible means.Javakhishvili, p. 160 Later, Pollio, swayed by Rhadamistus' bribery, induced the Roman soldiers to threaten capitulation of the garrison. Under this compulsion, Mithridates agreed to surrender to his nephew and quit the fortress.Bunson, p. 372Tacitus, XII, 46 Rhadamistus seeing his uncle threw himself into his embraces, feigning respect and calling him father-in-law and his parent. He promised that he would do him no harm or violence either by the sword or by poison.Tomlins, p. 568 He drew him into a neighboring woods, where he assured him that the appointed sacrifice was prepared for their confirmation of peace in the presence of the Iberian gods, as it was their custom, whenever they joined alliance, to unite their right hands and bind together the thumbs in a tight knot and then, when the blood would flow into the extremities, they would let it escape by a slight puncture and then suck it in turn.Crévier, p. 283 But on this occasion the one who was applying the knot pretended that it had fallen off, and suddenly seized the knees of Mithridates flinging him to the ground. At the same moment a rush was made by others, and chains were thrown around him. Rhadamistus was mindful of his promise so he neither unsheathed the sword nor used any poison against his uncle to kill him, but instead had him thrown on the ground and then smothered his uncle under a mass of heavy clothes and featherbeds.Crévier, p. 284 Later the sons of Mithridates were also butchered by Rhadamistus for having shed tears over their parent's death.Cantù, p. 405Tacitus, XII, 47 Rhadamistus also killed Mithridates' wife, who was his own sister.Rawlinson, XVI, p. 1 Rhadamistus became King of Armenia in 51. Rome chose not to aid their Armenian allies, as their summoned council said \\"any crime in a foreign country was to be welcomed with joy\\". They only nominally demanded from Pharasmanes to withdraw from Armenian territory and remove his son.Crévier, p. 285Javakhishvili, p. 161Tacitus, XII, 48 Despite this, the Roman governor of Cappadocia, Paelignus, invaded Armenia and ravaged the country. Syrian governor Gaius Ummidius Durmius Quadratus sent a force to restore order, but was recalled so as not to provoke a war with Parthia. Consequently, King Vologases I, having recently ascended the Parthian throne and needing a principality for his brother Tiridates, he saw in the situation of Armenia an excellent opportunity of gratifying his brother and advancing his own reputation. To detach Armenia once more from the dominion of Rome and re-attach it to Parthia would be a great inauguration of his reign so he sent his large army into Armenia in 51,Bunson, p. 544 eventually driving out the Iberians in 53.Rawlinson, p. 272 A severe winter epidemic and terrible plague forced the Parthians to withdraw from Armenia, allowing Rhadamistus to return who was now fiercer than ever.Tacitus, XII, 50Rawlinson, XVI, p. 2 Rhadamistus treated Armenians with extraordinary severity, looking on them as rebels who could forsake him if such opportunity is given.Crévier, pp. 286-287Tomlins, p. 569 He punished those Armenian cities that had surrendered to the Parthians, which soon revolted and replaced him with the Parthian prince Tiridates I in 55.Suny, p. 14 Rhadamistus escaped along with his pregnant wife, Zenobia. Unable to bear a long ride on horse, out of fear of the enemy and love of her husband, she convinced Rhadamistus to kill her with the honourable death to avoid the shame of captivity from their pursuers. Rhadamistus embraced, cheered, and encouraged her wife, admiring her heroism, he unsheathed his scymitar, stabbed her, dragged her to the bank of the Aras River and committed her to the river stream, so that her body might be swept away. Then in headlong flight he hurried to Iberia, his ancestral kingdom.Crévier, p. 287 Zenobia meanwhile as she yet breathed and showed signs of life on the calm water at the river's edge, was found by some shepherds, who inferring from her noble appearance and that she was no base-born woman, bound up her wound and applied to it their rustic remedies. When they found out her name and her adventure, they conveyed her to the city of Artaxata to King Tiridates, who received her kindly and treated her as a royal person.Cantù, p. 406Tacitus, XII, 51 Rhadamistus himself returning home to Iberia was soon, in 58,Toumanoff, p. 14 put to death as traitor who had plotted against the royal power by his own father who wanted to prove his loyalty to Rome,Javakhishvili, p. 161, § 5Tacitus, XIII, 37 and in particular to Emperor Nero.Crévier, p. 288Bunson, p. 465 Pharasmanes died later in the same year as well and he was succeeded by his second son and brother of Rhadamistus, Mihrdat, who became a new king of Iberia.Toumanoff, p. 101Javakhishvili, p. 161, § 6 In art Radamisto by George Frideric Handel, 1720. =Paintings= *\\"Radamisto uccide Zenobia\\" by Luigi Sabatelli (1803). *\\"Rhadamistes and Zenobia\\" by Jean- Joseph Taillasson. *\\"Shepherds Find Zenobia on the Banks of the Araxes\\" by William Bouguereau (1850) *\\"Radamisto in atto di spingere Zenobia ferita nel fiume Arasse\\" by Francesco Alberi. *\\"Queen Zenobia Thrown Into the Araxes River\\" by François-Nicolas Chifflart. *\\"Rhadamiste poignarde sa femme Zénobie\\" by Etienne Meslier. =Operas= *\\"L’Amour tyrannique\\" by Georges de Scudéry (1638). *\\"Zenobia e Radamisto\\" by Giovanni Legrenzi (1665). *\\"Radamisto\\" by Tomaso Albinoni (1698). *\\"L'amor tirannico, o Zenobia\\" by Domenico Lalli (1710). *\\"Rhadamiste et Zénobie\\" by Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon (1711). *\\"Radamisto\\" by George Frideric Handel (1720). *\\"Radamisto\\" by Nicola Francesco Haym. *Senesino was first to play Rhadamistus. =Plays= *Unfinished play \\"Rodamist i Zenobiya\\" by Alexander Griboyedov.

A visco fuse is a higher-quality fuse used for consumer fireworks. It is most commonly colored green or red, and is found as a twisted, coated strand. It is also used to create delays in the firing of multiple firework displays.  Description  Visco is a 3/32 - 1/8 inch (2–3 mm)-diameter cord with a black powder core. There are three external layers to visco fuse. First, a layer of string is wound around the core, then a second, less tight, layer of string is wound in the opposite direction to prevent unraveling. The last layer is a low-nitrate nitrocellulose lacquer that keeps the fuse from falling apart. The last layer helps to make the visco fuse water resistant and to prevent moisture from degrading the black powder core. Unlike dynamite safety fuse, visco fuse burns with a visible external flame. After ignition, most visco fuses can burn underwater.  Variants  Cannon fuse is a visco fuse that is most often thicker, steadier burning, and often extra coated to be more waterproof. Most cannon fuses of high quality can burn while under water. Cannon fuse is normally red or green in color. Flying fish fuse is a modified type of visco-type fuse used in fireworks. The composition in the core is a metallic spark composition or another effect instead of/as well as black powder. Flying fish can thus perform as a main effect instead of just an initiator. For example, simply lighting a short piece of flying fish on the ground makes it fly through the air, seeming to swim in random directions while emitting sparks and noise. An aerial shell loaded with many such pieces results in myriad fragments sparking and whizzing high in the air as a substitute for standard pyrotechnic stars. Igniter Cord is a commercial grade of visco fuse that is designed to ignite multiple safety fuses. Like visco, igniter cord burns with an external, visible flame. It is often heavily lacquered for water resistance, and sometimes has an inner wire core for mechanical strength.

Nelson Road was constructed in 1908 to provide better access to the Mount Nelson signal station.Howatson, Donald, The Story of Sandy Bay - Street by Street, 2016, History Mount Nelson was originally named 'Nelson's Hill' by Captain William Bligh (of Mutiny on the Bounty fame) in 1792 in honour of David Nelson, the botanist of the Bounty mission, as \\"he was the first white man on it\\" when the Bounty visited 'Van Diemens Land' on its way to Tahiti. Nelson was one of the Bounty crew who was loyal to Bligh during the mutiny. He died at Kupang in Timor on 20 July 1789 of an 'inflammatory fever' caused by the long open-boat voyage following the mutiny. His funeral was attended by the Governor and officers from every ship in the harbour. The name 'Nelson's Hill' was later changed to Mount Nelson. When Governor Lachlan Macquarie visited Van Diemen's Land in 1811, he directed that a signal post be established on the summit of Mount Nelson to announce the appearance of all ships entering the estuary. The semaphore technology of the signal station was superseded when Tasmania's first telephone line was established between the Mount Nelson signal station and the Hobart telegraph office in 1880. Most of the modern suburban development in Mount Nelson has taken place after 1945 when the government encouraged settlement of immigrants escaping the destruction that took place in Europe after World War II. During this same period the section of hillface north of the bends on Nelson Road, which used to be a firing range, was converted into university farm land for the University of Tasmania. A Rialannah Post Office opened on 1 April 1948 and was renamed Mount Nelson in 1956. It closed in 1971. In 1967 a large number of houses were destroyed by the Black Tuesday Bushfires.

Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark, wife of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, is a graduate of Hobart College. Mt Nelson is home to Mt Nelson Primary School. The school has approximately 200 students from Kinder - Grade 6. The school is a feeder to Taroona High School and encompasses Mt Nelson and Tolmans Hill. =Swift parrot= Mount Nelson is one of the breeding grounds for the endangered Swift parrot. It is thought that there are only around 1000 breeding pairs in existence. Mount Nelson Signal Station =Recreation and sites= Several bushland tracks (e.g. the Historical Truganini walking track) weave through the surrounding area. The Skyline Reserve also includes a collection of walking tracks. The Signal Station remains one of the areas main man-made attractions.

Geography  Maleny (pronounced mah-lay-knee) is north of Brisbane on the Blackall Range overlooking the Sunshine Coast hinterland. Nearby towns include Landsborough, Montville, Peachester, Palmwoods and Hunchy. Nearby places of geographical significance include the Glass House Mountains and Baroon Pocket Dam (in North Maleny). Baroon Pocket Dam constructed in 1989 is fed by the Obi Obi Creek, a significant tributary of the upper Mary River, which drains the basalt capped Maleny plateau. Water runoff statistics have been kept in this area since the 1940s showing that the average annual rainfall is and the runoff into Baroon Pocket Dam receives annually about 64,000 megalitres. The Baroon Pocket Dam holds about 61,000 megalitres of water and the treatment plant supplies about 150 megalitres of treated water to the Sunshine Coast daily. History Maleny circa 1922The name Maleny is probably derived from the parish name, which in turn is possibly derived from the Scottish place name Malleny, a village in Midlothian, Scotland. The area around Maleny was originally populated by the Nalbo and the Dallambara—two aboriginal tribes of the Gubbi Gubbi language group. The area was known for its bunya feasts which happened every third year when the giant bunya tree was in fruit. The first European to document Maleny was the explorer Ludwig Leichhardt who describes the area in his travel diary in 1844. The first European settlement followed in the wake of the Gympie gold rush of 1867. A track linking Maleny to Landsborough was cut in 1880. An official proclamation of Maleny as a town occurred in 1891. The Maleny Butter Factory began operation in 1904. Maleny Post Office opened by February 1906 (a receiving office had been open from 1889). Maleny Township State School opened on 22 April 1913. In 1915 its name was changed to Maleny State School. Maleny was a timber town until the early 1920s and then was a centre of dairy production and fruit growing. St George's Anglican Church was dedicated on 6 September 1931 by Archbishop Sharp. It had been relocated from the Beerburrum Soldier Settlement where it was dedicated (also as St George's) on 20 August 1922 by Canon D.J. Garland, but it fell into disuse due to the failure of the settlement and was formally closed in August 1931 prior to its removal to Maleny. The building was originally built as a chapel at the Enoggera army barracks during World War I by the Soldiers' Church of England Help Society.Download Many of the furnishings and ornaments of the church were donated in memory of soldiers who had died, including the altar and its furnishings which were donated in the member of Earl Kitchener. Although a campaign to have a police station in the town was started in the 1920s, it wasn't until 1952 that permission to convert a house into the police station and residence (in use until 2017) was granted. Maleny State High School opened 27 January 1987. Maleny War Memorial, 2008 On 15 August 1995, the Queensland Governor Leneen Forde dedicated the Maleny War Memorial. Since just after the turn of the 20th century, the Maleny Community Centre has provided facilities to residents and visitors for a wide range of activities. Located in the middle of town, the original centre was established as the result of a gift by one of its residents. At the Maleny recorded a population of 3,441 people. The Maleny Library was opened in 1998 with a major refurbishment in 2012. Heritage listings Maleny has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 15 Porter's Lane: Fairview * 58 Maple Street Maleny (Maleny Lodge) Geography Maleny is situated approximately above sea level, among the characteristic rolling green hills of the Sunshine Coast hinterland. Prior to European settlement, the area was covered in thick sub-tropical rainforest with huge hardwood trees. Loggers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries opened up the area seeking valuable timber, which was prized locally and in Europe. Heavy logging led to the almost complete denuding of the rainforest clad hills in the district around Maleny. Only a few pockets of forest remain in steeper terrain and in one large remnant patch (around ) which now forms Mary Cairncross Reserve. Climate Located on the humid eastern slopes of the Blackall Range, Maleny is one of the wettest towns in Queensland away from the north tropical coast. The average annual rainfall is about ; however, during unusually wet years twelve-month rainfall totals of up to can be recorded, with monthly totals over and 24-hour totals up to . Temperatures are mild and rarely get above in summer or drop below in winter. Tourism Hotel Maleny Maleny has replaced its timber-cutting and dairying past with tourism with a large influx of people who wanted an alternative lifestyle. As well as being on the Hinterland tourist drive, Maleny attracts daytrippers from Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast who are attracted to the various stores, art galleries and specialty shops. Development and protests Maleny Community Centre is a fully community-owned centre, completed Stage 1 of a three Stage redevelopment in 2010. Stage 2 was completed in 2012 and included rebuilding the Maple Street frontage and renovating the building into two storeys featuring an Queensland-style verandah over the footpath, giving much needed shelter on the main street. The Third Stage comprises the building of a new cultural centre on the MCC's second building at No. 1 Bicentenary Lane. The Maleny Community Centre renovations (Stage 1 & 2) were designed by Maleny based building designer, Norman Richards building design + interiors and built by Maleny based builder Ross Meneely. The controversial Woolworths supermarket at Maleny on the Obi Obi Creek Maleny's population growth since 2000 has brought an increase in urban development. Many local residents have resisted some of the development, the most notable being the establishment of a Woolworths store in the town. In July 2005, a rally attracted about 300 protestors objecting to the store. Many locals were opposed to the idea (79% of local residents opposed according to \\"Market Facts\\" survey of 20 July 2005). A number of motivations for the protest existed but of particular concern was that the supermarket was to be built over a significant platypus habitat and that local traders would be negatively affected as well as issues regarding local council members going against the original town planning agreement regarding all development in Maleny to be in fitting with \\"the village environ\\" that characterises much of the townships of the Blackall Range. Badges and posters reading \\"I WON'T SHOP THERE\\" were seen in Maleny as part of the anti-Woolworths campaign, although the bumper stickers can now be seen in the Woolworths car park. The campaign against the supermarket achieved international coverage. Despite protests and an offer to purchase the site for A$2 million (pledged by local residents) the supermarket opened on 3 April 2006. Although many residents refuse to shop in the supermarket, nonetheless Woolworths recorded it as one of its top 30 stores in 2008. In 2013 many residents protested the construction of a petrol station and convenience store at 19 & 21 Bunya St, Maleny by the IGA Supermarket. Protestors cited proximity to the primary school as the main issue with the development proposal. The proposal was abandoned by the owners of the IGA supermarket who said \\"We don't want to embroil our business in something that is controversial.\\" In 2016 Sydney based advertising executive and author David Rollins proposed a \\"TT Style\\" motorcycle race for the Maleny area. Maleny residents formed a protest group to oppose this event called \\"Peaceful Roads Sunshine Coast.\\" The group protested the event citing safety, noise and access issues of concern and that the event was not in keeping with the existing tourism activities in the area. The application was withdrawn in August 2018. Attractions Maleny Botanic Gardens Maleny is home to a large number of cooperative enterprises. There are art galleries, health food and organic produce stores, cafes, the Maleny Credit Union, a thriving business centre, rural settlements, a community golf course, alternative schools, alternative medical treatment centres, organic farms, intentional communities including the Crystal Waters Permaculture Village in nearby Conondale and the Fountainhead organic retreat and education centre (whose founder received a certificate from Senator Mark Furner for his work in helping those with depression and anxiety). Maleny hosted the Maleny Folk Festival from its inception in 1987 to 1993, when it was moved to the nearby town of Woodford and renamed to the Woodford Folk Festival. Since its construction the Baroon Pocket Dam has become an important recreation area for the Sunshine Coast hinterland. There is a sailing club, naval cadet unit, fishing club, accommodation and picnic facilities.

Rosina Lhévinne (née Bessie; March 29, 1880, Kiev, Ukraine, then a part of the Russian EmpireNovember 9, 1976, Glendale, California) was a pianist and famed pedagogue. Early life, education and family Rosina Bessie was the younger of two daughters of Maria (née Katz) and Jacques Bessie, a prosperous jeweller from a Dutch Jewish family who emigrated to the Russian Empire to ply his trade as a diamond merchant. There were violent anti-Semitic riots in Kiev during her first year, and the Bessies moved to Moscow in 1881 or 1882. The young Rosina began studying piano at the age of six with a teacher in Moscow, where the family had moved shortly after her birth. When her teacher became ill, a family friend suggested that she continue her studies with Josef Lhévinne, a talented student at the Moscow Imperial Conservatory, five years older than Rosina. She showed great talent and several years later was admitted to the Conservatory, where she also studied with Lhévinne's teacher, Vasily Safonov. At her graduation in 1898, she won the Gold Medal in piano as had Josef before her, and that year the two were married. They had two children, Constantine \\"Don\\" Lhevinne (1906-1998) and Marianna Lhevinne Graham (1918-2012). Music career Rosina gave up her ambitions to be a solo performer to avoid clashing with her husband Josef's career as a concert pianist, a vow she kept until well after his death in 1944. Thus she confined her activities to teaching and performing on two pianos with her husband.Jean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, \\"Solo de duo\\", Neva Editions, 2015, p.97. Together they lived and taught in Moscow, Tbilisi, Georgia and later in Berlin before emigrating after World War I and the Russian Revolution to New York, where they joined the faculty of the Institute of Musical Art which later became The Juilliard School. =Teaching= Having acted essentially as a preparatory teacher to her more famous husband's students for 46 years, she felt reluctant after his death to assume his full duties at the school; however, Juilliard's administrators were unanimous in wanting her to continue in her husband's place. Among her students were many of the best young pianists of the 1940s, 50s and 60s, including Van Cliburn, who arrived in her class in 1951. At the height of the Cold War in 1958, he was awarded the First Prize at the inaugural Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow becoming an instant worldwide celebrity and bringing international fame to his teacher. Other Lhévinne students include James Levine, Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera, John Williams, composer and conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra, the composer Judith Lang Zaimont, pianists John Browning, Walter Buczynski, Kun Woo Paik, Seth Carlin, Eduardo Delgado, Madeleine Forte, Edna Golandsky, Tong-Il Han, James Levine, Anthony & Joseph Paratore, Daniel Pollack, Marcus Raskin, Misha Dichter, Edward Auer, Santos Ojeda, Joel Ryce-Menuhin, Garrick Ohlsson, Joseph William Fennimore, Hiroko Nakamura, Neal Larrabee, and many others including several present-day teachers at the Juilliard School. =Performance= In 1949 Mme. Lhévinne reconsidered her decision never to play in public as a soloist, and in her 70s and 80s she made a remarkable series of appearances, first in collaboration with the Juilliard String Quartet, and later in concertos at the Aspen Summer Music Festival. Her greatest moment as a soloist came in January 1963, aged 82, with her debut at the New York Philharmonic under conductor Leonard Bernstein playing Frédéric Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1, a piece she had performed for her graduation from the Moscow Conservatory sixty-five years earlier. There are recordings of both the Chopin Concerto and Mozart's C major Concerto, K. 467. Death and legacy Madame Lhévinne continued to teach at Juilliard and at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles where she died in 1976 at age 96. Just prior to her death, Robert K. Wallace published a book about the Lhévinnes entitled A Century of Music-Making: The Lives of Josef and Rosina Lhévinne, for which she was extensively interviewed. In 2003, Madame Lhévinne's former student and assistant, Salome Ramras Arkatov, produced a documentary film, The Legacy of Rosina Lhévinne, which contains rare archival footage of Lhévinne's teaching and performing as well as interviews with a number of her former students.

Allan Bridge (February 14, 1945 – August 5, 1995) was an American conceptual artist best known for his creation in 1980 of the confessional phone system known as the Apology Line. He went by the pseudonym Mr. Apology (a label which has since been adopted by an advice columnist) and used new technology of the time, an answering machine, to record confessions from anonymous callers. Life and career Born in Falls Church, Virginia, Bridge attended the University of Chicago, where he earned a bachelor's degree in fine arts. Returning to the Washington, D. C. area, he became one of the second generation of artists of the Washington Color School movement. For a series of large-scale paintings, he used poured paint techniques and then moved on to geometric abstraction. He was championed and collected by Gene Baro, at one time the director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art. Bridge exhibited at the Corcoran and many other galleries in the 1970s. He created at least 79 paintings in the years spanning 1970 to 1977. Bridge married Elinor Schiele in 1977, and they divorced in 1981. Eventually, Bridge tired of the visual image and began making interactive machines with moral implications. The most famous best known of these is Crime Time, where the viewer spins a wheel of chance and either gets away with a \\"crime\\" by receiving a marble from the machine, or he gets \\"caught\\" and his hand is held in a lock for 30 seconds. From Crime Time, the next jump for his restless mind was the Apology Line, created after he moved to Manhattan in 1977.Apology Line: Allan Bridge Bridge sold rights for a film and novel. Mr. Apology by Campbell Black was published by Ballantine Books in 1984, and this was adapted by screenwriter Mark Medoff for the HBO thriller, Apology (1986). The film switched the sex of the conceptual artist from male to female (portrayed by Lesley Ann Warren). In 1993, Bridge was the subject of a long article, \\"The Confession,\\" by Alec Wilkinson, published in the October 4, 1993, issue of The New Yorker.Wilkinson, Alec. \\"The Confession,\\" The New Yorker, October 4, 1993. Wilkinson's article was reprinted a decade later in Mr. Apology and Other Essays (Houghton Mifflin, 2003).Wilkinson, Alec. Mr. Apology and Other Essays. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2003. Confessions Some confessions taped from the Apology phone calls were published in Apology, a magazine edited and published by Bridge. The last issue was published January 1996. After investigating the notion of bringing the Apology Project to the online service GEnie, he was working on a book about the Apology Line and making plans in 1995 to expand the Apology confessions to the Internet. In 1989, his second wife, Marissa Bridge, founded Marissa Bridge Studios, which became one of New York's leading decorative painting and restoration companies, with offices in Manhattan and the Hamptons.Marissa Bridge Studios Active in boating and scuba diving, Bridge was diving in August 1995, when he was killed by a hit-and-run jet skier. Lydia Nibley wrote about this in her essay \\"All Apologies\\" (December 16, 2004): :The man's heavily accented voice hesitated only briefly before he confessed to multiple murders: \\"I want to apologize. I don't know if even what I did was wrong or right, but when I was in Israel for six months, I killed six Arabs at night with a gang of other Jewish settlers. At the time we thought -- I believed -- we were fighting for our homeland to keep it from the Arabs. But perhaps now that I'm here in America, I realize that maybe killing is not the right way, and I want to apologize.\\" :This message was left anonymously on a phone-message service called the Apology Line, where people recorded their confessions and also listened to others admit to acts of intentional cruelty, silly screw-ups, unfortunate and unintentional mistakes and, on occasion, even murder. From 1980 to 1995, Allan Bridge ran the line as something of a secular priest, offering the potential for forgiveness through the catharsis of taped confession--until the day he was killed by a Jet-Skier who fled the scene and was never identified. :Allan's wife, Marissa, was convinced that had her husband lived, he would have forgiven the person who hit him. But does that Jet-Skier--who was seen circling back to confirm that it wasn't driftwood, but a man in scuba gear he had hit--live the rest of his life plagued by remorse and guilt? And would confessing to someone, anyone, even anonymously, make a difference?... :When asked if she is sure Allan would have been able to forgive the Jet-Skier who hit him--even without an apology--Marissa Bridge imagines several scenarios. \\"The person knew it was an accident and that it wasn't his fault,\\" she says. \\"He couldn't have predicted a scuba diver would surface at that moment right in front of him. Maybe the person was really young and gave into the impulse to run away rather than to stay and face things. I'm sure whoever they are, they are sorry.\\" :She explains that listening to Allan's collection of tapes from the Apology Line helps her understand that the average person is in some level of pain about past actions, and that people who have bigger regrets have a larger burden to carry. \\"Allan was a petty criminal in his early life, and he worried that people could fall too easily into being either the predator or the prey. He lived his life to say, 'Let's see if we can be better people.'\\" Several passages about Bridge and jet skis are scattered throughout The Unwanted Sound of Everything We Want: A Book About Noise by Garret Keizer.Keizer, Garret. The Unwanted Sound of Everything We Want: A Book About Noise, PublicAffairs, 2010. Play Apology, a new theatrical piece based on the life and work of Allan Bridge, is being developed by Greg Pierotti, co-writer of The Laramie Project. Exhibitions A bank of phone booths were installed for Bridge's 1981 show at the New Museum, enabling guests to pick listen directly to the original Apology Line tapes.

A native of Manhattan's Lower East Side, Silver served in the New York State Assembly from 1977 to 2015. In 1994, he was selected as the Speaker of the Assembly; he held that position for two decades. During this period, Silver was known as one of the most powerful politicians in the state. Silver was arrested on federal corruption charges in early 2015, and resigned as Speaker of the Assembly shortly afterward. At his trial that November, he was convicted of all charges; the felony convictions triggered his automatic expulsion from the Assembly. Silver's conviction was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, but in May 2018, following a retrial, he was found guilty on the same charges and was sentenced to seven years in prison. After another appeal, the Second Circuit Court dismissed the guilty verdicts for three of the charges, but upheld them for four other charges. Silver was resentenced in July 2020 to years in prison and a $1 million fine. He is incarcerated in the federal prison at Otisville, New York. Early life An Orthodox Jew whose parents were Russian immigrants, Silver is a native of Manhattan's Lower East Side. He graduated from the Rabbi Jacob Joseph High School on Henry Street, where he was captain of the basketball team. Silver graduated from Yeshiva University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965, and received his J.D. from Brooklyn Law School in 1968. Law career Silver practiced law with the firm of Schecter and Schwartz from 1968 until 1971, and then served as law secretary for New York City Civil Court Judge Francis N. Pecora from 1971 to 1976. In addition to Silver's duties in the New York State Assembly from 1977 to 2015, he was \\"of counsel\\" at Weitz & Luxenberg, one of New York State's largest personal injury litigation firms. For years, Weitz & Luxenberg insisted that Silver's ties with the firm were negligible. In 2007, the New York Post charged that Silver's refusal to disclose the terms of his employment or the income he received raised suspicions of a conflict of interest. When these details became public, the income he had received from Weitz & Luxenberg and the manner in which Silver obtained it ultimately led to his arrest, resignation as Speaker, conviction, and prison sentence. Political career Silver, Carolyn Maloney, and C. Virginia Fields announce federal funds for construction of the Second Avenue subway, December 2001 Silver, Eliot Engel, and Jeffrey Dinowitz at the Israel Day Parade in New York, May 2004 =Elections= Silver was first elected to the Assembly in 1976 and rose to key committee leadership positions. He represented the Assembly District variously numbered as 62nd through 65th, comprising much of Lower Manhattan, notably the Financial District and the former World Trade Center site. Silver advanced to the chairmanship of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee in 1991, and served in this post until becoming Speaker. During the election years of his speakership, 1994–2014, Silver's district typically re-elected him with 80 to 90 percent of the vote. In 2008, he had his first Democratic primary challenge in over two decades, winning 69 percent, or 7,037 votes, to defeat his challengers, Paul Newell, who earned 22 percent (2,401 votes), and Luke Henry with 9 percent (891). Silver was re-elected on November 4 with 27,632 votes. His Republican challenger, Danniel Maio, received 7,387 votes. =Speaker of New York State Assembly= On February 11, 1994, after Saul Weprin died from a stroke, Silver became the Speaker of the New York State Assembly. He was re-elected to that post 11 times. Silver served as Assembly Speaker until November 30, 2015. During his speakership, Silver was known for an \\"opaque and autocratic style of governance\\", and \\"was one of the most powerful and feared politicians in New York\\". In 2018, Daniel Leddy of the Staten Island Advance penned the following words: \\"As speaker of the New York State Assembly, Sheldon Silver was corruption personified, an iron-fisted dictator who turned that legislative body into his own personal, profit-making enterprise. The full extent of Silver's sleaziness will never be known, nor will the identity of those irreparably harmed by it\\". Death penalty As Speaker, Silver was instrumental in the reinstatement of the death penalty in New York State in 1995. It was eventually ruled unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals in 2004 (see People v. LaValle), as the law stipulated that if jurors were deadlocked between sentences of life without parole and execution, the court would sentence the defendant to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving 20 to 25 years. The Court ruled that in such a case, execution would seem unfairly preferable to the jury. New York's crime rate had dropped significantly in the decade since the law was passed, without seeing a single execution, and Silver let the law expire without much debate. In December 2005, after two New York City police officers were killed in as many months, Governor George Pataki called for reinstatement of the death penalty. The New York Times quoted Silver's spokesman Charles Carrier as saying, \\"He no longer supports it because Assembly hearings have shown it is not the most effective way to improve public safety.\\" Affordable housing In 1997 and throughout his Assembly career, Silver was a key advocate of state-administered rent regulation of New York apartments. This complex and highly politicized system made the Speaker a central figure, continually courted by major participants in the real-estate industry. In 1967, New York City leveled the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area in Silver's neighborhood, and removed more than 1,800 low-income largely Hispanic families, with a promise that they could return to new low-income apartments when they were built. However, the site was kept undeveloped for decades afterward, as Silver and key allies strove to maintain the area's Jewish identity and opposed affordable housing, which would have brought more Hispanic and Chinese residents. Finally in 2012, the site was approved for the Essex Crossing mixed-use development project. Construction is scheduled to be completed in 2024, some 57 years after the site was cleared. Commuter tax In 1999, Silver was instrumental in the repeal of New York City's commuter tax on non-resident earners. The repeal was a benefit to those commuting to work in the city from surrounding areas, but came at a substantial cost to New York City residents. Silver was criticized by city leaders for removing the tax, and although he suggested he would support reinstating it after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, he took no steps to do so. Attempted \\"coup\\" and criticism In 2000, Silver faced an attempted \\"coup\\" in the Assembly as members, primarily from Upstate New York and dissatisfied with his leadership style, tried to overthrow him as Speaker. Michael Bragman, the leader of the backlash, lost his position as majority leader. An editorial in The Buffalo News, written in response, criticized Silver for having too much power: > The problem—which also exists in the State Senate—can be boiled down to a > single overarching issue: The Assembly speaker has too much power. He > controls everything, from the legislation that can be voted on to how his > normally docile members vote on it. He decides what the Assembly will accept > in a state budget. He negotiates secretly with the other two leaders to > hammer out important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And he ignores the > wishes of less-exalted lawmakers. Similar criticisms of New York State's \\"three men in a room\\" have been widespread for years. New York congestion tolls In July 2007, Silver was skeptical about Mayor Michael Bloomberg's New York congestion pricing program. When a meeting of the Democratic Assembly Conference indicated the proposal lacked sufficient support, Silver declined to schedule a vote on the measure, and it died. Although he stated that he \\"probably would have voted for the bill,\\" a majority of his conference opposed the proposed plan. Mixed martial arts Silver, in his role as Speaker, was widely blamed for the delay in passing A04146A through the Assembly to legalize professional mixed martial arts in New York State. New York became the last of the 50 states to allow the sport in early 2016, after Silver's expulsion from the Assembly. Failure to investigate sexual harassment A former top aide to Silver, chief counsel J. Michael Boxley, was accused of raping two legislative aides while he was working for the Speaker, and Boxley eventually pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct. Silver was sued for failing to investigate the accusations properly and for tolerating a culture of sexual harassment in the Assembly. In 2006, Silver and the Assembly leadership agreed to pay $500,000 to settle the lawsuit. Similar settlements in 2012 and 2015 resulted from multiple harassment charges against former Assemblyman Vito Lopez, and Silver was accused of not acting forcefully to prevent Lopez's behavior. Silver apologized for not reporting cases to the Assembly's Ethics Committee as required, and said that since then he \\"put in place new policies to ensure these incidents are dealt with swiftly and transparently.\\" Criminal proceedings On January 7, 2015, Silver was re-elected Speaker of the New York State Assembly for the 11th time, with almost unanimous support from the Democratic majority despite an ongoing federal probe into his outside income. Two weeks later, on January 22, Silver was arrested on federal corruption charges resulting from that probe. The federal inquiry, which followed the state's abrupt disbandment of its Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption, focused on large payments that Silver received for years from Goldberg & Iryami, a law firm that specialized in seeking reductions of New York City real estate taxes for real estate developers. Silver was alleged to have persuaded developers who had business with the state to use the firm, which in turn generated $700,000 in referral fees to Silver. Investigators led by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara charged that Silver did not properly disclose the payments from the firm on his annual financial disclosure filings with the state. Goldberg & Iryami's major client was the state's single-largest political donor. One of the firm's founders partner, Jay Goldberg, was Silver's former Assembly counsel. Goldberg's partner at the firm, Dara Iryami, agreed to testify under immunity. Similar charges were also filed involving millions of dollars in referral fees that Silver received from the law firm Weitz & Luxenberg. In this scheme, Silver was alleged to have directed about $500,000 in state grants to Dr. Robert Taub, a researcher in diseases caused by asbestos and the director of the Columbia University Mesothelioma Center. Taub then referred asbestos claimants to Weitz & Luxemburg, which paid Silver $1.4 million in salary and another $3.9 million in referral fees, although he did no work for them. After the charges were announced, Weitz and Luxemburg promptly placed Silver on leave. Both Taub and another of Silver's longtime associates, Brian Meara, provided key information to investigators in exchange for non-prosecution agreements. On January 30, after a week of intense political pressure and dwindling support, Silver submitted his resignation as Speaker, effective February 2, while retaining his seat as a member of the Assembly and vowing to fight the charges against him. On February 3, the Assembly elected Carl Heastie as their new Speaker. On April 25, 2015, Silver was indicted on additional charges of making illegal investments through private vehicles, netting a profit of $750,000. He pleaded not guilty to those charges three days later, on April 28. =Trial= Silver's trial on seven corruption charges lasted for much of November 2015. On November 30, 2015, a unanimous jury found Silver guilty on all seven counts, triggering his automatic expulsion from the Assembly. The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, which handles judicial and attorney misconduct, affirmed his automatic disbarment for the felony convictions. On May 3, 2016, federal judge Valerie E. Caproni of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, who presided over the trial, sentenced Silver to 12 years in prison, and ordered him to pay $5.3 million in ill-gotten gains and $1.75 million in additional fines. Silver received two prison terms: 12 years for six criminal counts against him and 10 years on the seventh, to run concurrently. =Appeal= After the conviction, he remained free on bail as a panel of judges considered his appeal based on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in McDonnell v. United States that reversed the corruption conviction of former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell. The Supreme Court decision in the McDonnell case narrowed the kinds of activities that could constitute corruption, and Silver's conviction was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan on July 13, 2017. =Second trial, conviction, appeal, and resentencing= After his conviction was overturned, Silver was retried on the same charges. On May 11, 2018, he was again found guilty on all counts. On July 27, 2018, Judge Caproni sentenced him to seven years in prison, five years less than the sentence she gave him for his first conviction, citing his advancing age. Silver was due to report to prison on October 5, 2018, but this was stayed as he again appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. While his case was under continued appeal, he remained free on $200,000 bail. On January 21, 2020, the panel unanimously dismissed the three charges stemming from Silver's involvement in the asbestos exposure cases but upheld the four charges related to the kickbacks from Goldberg & Iryami and money laundering, sending the case back to Judge Caproni for resentencing. Silver was resentenced by Judge Caproni on July 20, this time to years in prison and a fine of $1 million. He reported to federal prison at Otisville, New York, on August 26, 2020.Brendan J. Lyons, Sheldon Silver, once a powerful figure in New York, heads to prison, Times Union (August 26, 2020). Personal life Silver and his wife Rosa, a former special needs schoolteacher, have four adult children. According to court papers unsealed during the sentencing phase of his first trial, Silver was alleged to have had two extra-marital affairs, both of which were connected to his Albany position. By the time he became Speaker of the Assembly, he was known to play basketball with other high- ranking officials, including former Governor Mario Cuomo and former Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi. Two weeks after Silver's first criminal conviction, his son-in-law Marcello Trebitsch was sentenced to prison for a separate multimillion-dollar crime, also prosecuted by Bharara's office.

Early life He was born in Santiago, the son of Joaquín Pinto and Mercedes Díaz de la Puente. Pinto completed his early studies in the Convictorio Carolino, the best school in the country at the time, and then studied law at the Real Universidad de San Felipe, being admitted to practice on October 11, 1808. In his youth he dedicated himself to commerce. According to the social norms of the time, he also became a militia officer in the \\"Regimiento del Rey\\" (King's regiment). In 1810, while in Lima, he heard of the formation of the Government Junta of the Kingdom, and immediately returned to the country, where he was charged with a diplomatic mission to Buenos Aires. After that successful first mission, he was sent to England, and then to other European countries, with the mission of gathering support for the independence movement. While in Europe he learnt of the news of the defeat of the Chilean army in the Battle of Rancagua and the recapture of Chile by the Spanish troops. He then returned to Argentina to cooperate in the formation of a new army. Pinto married Luisa Garmendia Aldurralde and had two children, Aníbal Pinto, who would become President of Chile, and Enriqueta Pinto, future wife of President Manuel Bulnes. His grandnephew (and grandson of José Miguel Carrera), Ignacio Carrera Pinto, became a hero at the War of the Pacific. Political career In 1820 he finally returned to Chile. He was then sent by Bernardo O'Higgins to Peru, to help in the independence of that country. In 1824 he was named as Minister of Government and Foreign Affairs, and in 1825, Intendant of Coquimbo. In 1827, due to the resignation of President Agustín Eyzaguirre, General Ramón Freire was elected President, while General Pinto was elected Vice President. When General Freire himself resigned on May 5, 1827, General Pinto took over the position as \\"Accidental President\\". As such he participated in the drafting of the Constitution of 1828. A new presidential election was called in May 1829. General Pinto was the clear winner out of 9 candidates, with 118 electoral votes (29.06%), and was proclaimed elected on October 19. Nevertheless, the onset of the Chilean Civil War of 1829 was at hand. The problem that caused the revolution happened in the vice presidential election. The winner should have been the first runner- up, Francisco Ruiz-Tagle (98 electoral votes or 24.13%), or the second runner- up, General José Joaquín Prieto, (61 votes or 15.02%), both conservatives. Nonetheless, Congress was controlled by the liberals and presided by Francisco Ramón Vicuña, also liberal. Arguing that no vice-presidential candidate had a majority, they selected Joaquín Vicuña, brother of the president of the senate, even though he only got 48 electoral votes (11.82%). That was all the excuse needed by the conservatives to rebel. Pinto resigned the Presidency on November 2 (less than two weeks after his proclamation), an event that marked his retirement from public life. All his powers were assumed by the President of Congress, Francisco Ramón Vicuña, who was already acting as \\"Accidental President\\" since July 16, 1829, when Pinto had delegated his powers on him for the duration of the electoral campaign. =Cabinet= Pinto only returned to public life in 1841, as a congressman. The Liberal party proclaimed him as a candidate to the Presidency in the Chilean presidential elections of 1841, in opposition to his son in law, General Manuel Bulnes, whom finally resulted elected. He did not participate in the campaign in any active form. Nonetheless he was elected a deputy for La Serena, and president of the chamber, on May 30, 1843. He was elected a senator in 1846, and became a member of the permanent war and navy commission. He was also named Privy Council by President Bulnes. On July 5, 1847 he was elected president of the Senate. He was reelected as a senator on 1855. Pinto died in Santiago at the age of 72, on July 18, 1858, before the end of his mandate as senator.

They most commonly blend the older Spanish system and Anglo-American conventions, where there is a distinction between the \\"Christian name\\" and the \\"surname\\". The construct containing several middle names is common to all systems, but having multiple \\"first\\" names and only one middle and last name is a result of the blending of American and Spanish naming customs. The Tagalog language is one of the few national languages in Asia to practically use the Western name order while formally using the eastern name order. The Philippine naming custom is identical to the Spanish and Portuguese name customs and, to an extent, Chinese naming customs. Today, Filipinos usually abide by the Spanish system of using both paternal and maternal surnames, with the latter used as the \\"middle name\\". An example would be Jose Cuyegkeng y Mangahas becoming Jose Mangahas Cuyegkeng, where the particle y is used only for legal purposes and is otherwise dropped. The middle name in its natural sense would have been the second name if the person had one, but is never counted as an individual's given name. Historical context and examples In ancient times, the Tagalogs had a naming system that changed via family dynamics. A Tagalog man (especially a chief) would lose his name, take his first born's name, and become known as \\"son's/daughter's father\\"; rather than his offspring adopting his surname like today. If he was baptized into Christianity, he would take a Spanish \\"Christian name\\" but retain his native name as surname. For example Calao's father became Don Luis Amanicalao (Lord Luis, a chief of Tondo, Calao's Father). This also applied to mothers (e.g., Inanicao) etc. One also gained numerous \\"poetic\\" titles (i.e., \\"pamagat\\"; lit. \\"to have something to go before\\", today literally translated as \\"title\\", from where the prenom \\"Gat\\" is derived) from his renown/actions (eg valiance in battle) or other naming means (like a naming feast for those without offspring). Historical examples: Manila/Tagalog chiefs listed in the Tondo Conspiracy (1587-88) Phelipe Amarlangagui/Amarlangagui ('Felipe, Ama ni Langawi'), Luis Amanicalao (Luis, Ama ni Calao), and Omaghicon/Amaghikon (Ama ni Hikon). Another example is found in the only surviving baybayin writings; i.e., the Sto. Thomas Land Titles (1613-1625). In Document B (1625), Line 12, a certain Amadaga was named. The contract stated that the owner of the land adjacent to the one sold in the contract was Maria Gada who had acquired it from Amadaga. Although no other context was given in the document, it is quite possible that Maria Gada is the daughter of \\"Ama ni Gada\\" (misspelled) and inherited the land from him as a legacy. Given names Filipinos may have one or more official given names (as registered in their birth certificates and baptismal certificates) and various types of temporary or permanent nicknames. Filipinos commonly give themselves or each other nicknames and monikers. Some nicknames are carried for life, while others are used only with certain groups; a person can have multiple nicknames at different ages or among different groups of people. =Abbreviations, combinations, and elisions= Long given names can be shortened in various ways. Emmanuel can become Eman, Manuel, Manolo, Manny, or Manoy; and Consolación would be shortened to Connie, Cons, Sol, or Chona. Filipino women with two given names such as María Cristina or María Victoria may choose to abbreviate the very common María (in honor of the Virgin Mary) as Ma. (with a full stop), thus rendering these given names as Ma. Cristina or Ma. Victoria. Filipino males with two given names such as José Mariano or José Gerardo could follow the same practice of abbreviating José as Jo., though this is not as consistent. Another common practice seen in other cultures (most commonly with Spanish conventions) is to elide or combine multiple given names into one nickname. The aforementioned María Cristina and María Victoria may thus acquire the nicknames Maricris and Marivic. Thus the Filipino names Maricel, Maritoni, Marijo, Maritess, and Maricon come from Maria Celia (or Celeste), Marie Antoinette, María Josefa (or Josefina), María Teresa, and María Concepción (or Consolación) respectively. A related custom is that parents combine their given names to create a name for their child. For example: *Maria + Carlos = Malolos *Elvin + Liza = Elliza *Marino + Erlinda = Marinerl Some first names like Lodegrano or Lorimer may have been invented on the spot by the parents, or derived from some partially remembered foreign term. Other coined first names have unusual spellings or spellings which are pronounced differently. =Honorifics and titles= Honorifics and titles are sometimes used in place of a person's actual name. As such, titles for family elders are often used by the younger persons and then adopted by the wider community: Apo (grandson/granddaughter). Lolo (grandfather) and Lola (grandmother) are used for senior elders; Tatay/Itay/Ama (father) or Tito/Tiyo/Tsong (uncle) and Nanay/Inay/Ina (mother) or Tita/Tiya/Tsang (aunt) for middle-aged elders; Manong or Kuya (elder brother) and Manang or Ate (elder sister) for anyone slightly older than the person speaking. People in the Filipino community are often addressed by their military or police rank, professional titles or job descriptions, either with or without their names (e.g., Architect, Attorney, Engineer, Teacher etc.) instead of Mister, Miss, Ms, or Mrs. especially when the addressee's name is not yet known by the speaker. This applies to all people that are living and working in the Philippines. Sir and Madam/Ma'am are usually not used before a nickname. =Numerals and birth order patterns= People with the same name as their father are registered as Junior (abbreviated to Jr.) or numbered with Roman numerals (III, IV, V, etc.); their father adds Senior (Sr.) after his surname or suffix. Inevitably, the younger person tends to be nicknamed Junior, Jun or Junjun permanently. This can also be applied to numerals; i.e., the nickname can be Third or Fourth. Because of this, a family will necessarily bestow a variety of unofficial nicknames to distinguish the various people with nearly identical official given names. Many nicknames are bestowed by parents or other elders on children while they are still toddlers (e.g., Boy, Toto/Totoy (young boy), Girlie, Baby, etc.) and these nicknames are often carried by the person throughout their lives. These names may follow a certain pattern in certain cases, such as beginning with a certain letter of the alphabet (e.g., Diego Arnel, Diamond Amelia), such that all their initials will be the same (e.g. DAZL if the middle name is Zulueta and the surname is Lim). An example is former Senator Joker Arroyo's brother, Jack. Children can also be named after certain themes, such as countries, car trademarks, and popular brand names. For instance, World Champion boxer and incumbent Senator Manny Pacquiao named his two daughters Queen Elizabeth and Princess. =Reversals, indigenized names and anglicization= The Filipino given name Dranreb was invented by reversing the spelling of the English name Bernard, while someone calling himself Nosrac bears the legal name Carson. Joseph Ejército Estrada, Thirteenth President of the Philippines, began as a movie actor and received his nickname Erap as an adult; it comes from Pare spelled backwards (from Spanish compadre, which means \\"fellow godparent\\"). An old custom is to replace or insert Filipino phonemes into a Spanish or English name: Mariano becomes Nano, Edwin becomes Aweng, Eduardo becomes Dwarding, Roberto becomes Berting, Ponciano becomes either Popoy, Onse, or Syano. Sometimes there is a tendency to convert a grandiose given name into something more mundane, such as when John Paul becomes JayPee, Peter John becomes Peejong, Anthony becomes Tonyo and María Elena becomes Ineng or Inyang. Complementary to this is the practise of anglicizing (with the implication of \\"modernising\\") a Spanish given name. Thus José Roberto becomes Joseph Robert (further shortened to Joebert) and Eduardo becomes Edward and then Eddy or Eddie Boy (sometimes further shortened to Daboy). =Monikers and progressional names= The variety of Filipino names, some of them with negative connotations in the English language, often take English speakers by surprise. However, most Filipinos usually don't notice these negative connotations unless they are pointed out. Many Filipino celebrities and high-status personalities, such as actors and politicians, are often more well-known by their nicknames than their actual given names. One example of this is film and television celebrity German Moreno who is more known by the nickname Kuya Germs (kuya = elder brother).  Middle names SurnamesIndigenous languages= Though most Filipinos adopted Malaysian/Indonesian, Chinese and European (especially Spanish and English) surnames, some chose surnames that derive from words in indigenous languages, like Tagalog, Visayan (Cebuano and Hiligaynon), Ilocano, Kapampangan, and Pangasinan. Many indigenous surnames derive from words displaying qualities of people, especially those related to strength (e.g., Tagalog Macaraeg and Panganiban), defiance (e.g. Tagalog Dimayuga), or settlement (e.g. Cebuano/Hiligaynon Magbanua). Most indigenous surnames are spelled closely following the Spanish-derived orthographic conventions of the time. Many of these words are spelled differently today in the various Philippine languages (following spelling reforms since the late 19th century). =Cordilleran= Unlike their lowlander counterparts, Igorots living in the Cordillera Central in northern Luzon were not conquered by the Spaniards and preserved their naming customs from foreign influence. Each group had their own naming customs, but generally, like Indonesian names, there is only one given name and no surname to speak of. The given name's meaning is usually connected to natural phenomena or objects, such as danum for water. Only the Igorots who have had interacted with Spaniards and lowlanders for trade were given a name that follows the binomial \\"first name\\"-\\"surname\\" system, such as Mateo Cariño and Mateo Carantes. At the beginning of the 20th century and the advent of the American occupation of the Philippines, the Igorots' naming customs slowly conformed with the national legal naming system used today, aided by the evangelization efforts of American Protestant missionaries. Most older people, however, still keep the singular given name given to them by their parents while also using the \\"Christian names\\" to conform to Philippine law. The singular given names of some individuals living in the early 20th century have since been adopted as a surname by their descendants. =Spanish= Almost all Filipinos had Spanish or Spanish-sounding surnames imposed on them for taxation purposes, but a number of them have indigenous Filipino surnames. On November 21, 1849, Governor General Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa issued a decree stating that Filipinos should adopt Spanish surnames to make census counting easier. Some Filipinos retained their native pre-colonial names, especially those who were exempted from the Clavería decree such as the descendants of rulers of the Maharlika or noble class. These surnames of the native nobility include Lacandola, Macapagal, Macabulos, and Tupas whom each descended from different Datus. They were allowed to keep the name to claim tax exemptions. The Spanish surname category provides the most common surnames in the Philippines. At the course of time, some Spanish surnames were altered (with some eventually diverged/displaced their original spelling), as resulted from illiteracy among the poor and farming class bearing such surnames, creating confusion in the civil registry and a sense of detachment from their better- off relatives. Except for the \\"ñ\\", Filipino surnames from Spanish are written without accents due to US-imported typewriters used in civil registry that lack special characters. =Chinese= Chinese Filipinos whose ancestors came to the Philippines from 1898 onward usually have single syllable Chinese surnames. On the other hand, most Chinese ancestors came to the Philippines prior to 1898 usually have multiple syllable Chinese surnames such as Gokongwei, Ongpin, Pempengco, Yuchengco, Teehankee, and Yaptinchay among such others. These were originally full Chinese names which were transliterated in Spanish orthography and adopted as surnames. Common Chinese Filipino surnames are: Ong/Wong (Wang, 王), Lee/Dy/Sy (Li, 李), Chan/Tan (Chen, 陈), Lao/Lew (Liu, 刘), Tiong/Chong (Zhang, 张), Yung/Yana/Auyong/Awyoung (Yang, 杨), Ng/Uy/Wee (Huang, 黄), Tiu/Chiu/Chio/Chu (Zhao, 赵). There are also multiple syllable Chinese surnames that are Spanish transliterations of Hokkien words. Surnames like Tuazon (Eldest Grandson, 大孫), Dizon (Second Grandson, 二孫), Samson/Sanson (Third Grandson, 三孫), Sison (Fourth Grandson, 四孫), Gozon/Goson/Gozum (Fifth Grandson, 五孫), Lacson (Sixth Grandson, 六孫) are examples of transliterations of designations that use the Hokkien suffix -son (孫) used as surnames for some Chinese Filipinos who trace their ancestry from Chinese immigrants to the Philippines during the Spanish Colonial Period. The surname \\"Son/Sun\\" (孫) is listed in the classic Chinese text Hundred Family Surnames, perhaps shedding light on the Hokkien suffix -son used here as a surname alongside some sort of accompanying enumeration scheme.

Admission is free. The formation of the collection dates back to 1814. The principal goal of the museum is to educate the public about the history of the field of clock and watchmaking (horology), principally in the City of London, and also to promote education and career possibilities in the craft of horology, which as of 2019 was placed on the HCA Red List of Endangered Crafts. The Archive of the Clockmakers is managed on its behalf by the London Metropolitan Archive and is located at Guildhall Library, where the Library collection of printed books is also held and managed. History The Clockmakers Company first established a library collection in 1814, under the control of a library committee, in which Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy soon emerged as the most prominent figure, remaining so for several decades. Early meetings were held at Vulliamy's premises in Pall Mall, London but in 1817 the Company acquired a mahogany bureau and bookcase from Gillows of Lancaster and London, to house its growing collection, and this was established in an upper room in the Kings Head Tavern in Poultry, London, where the Company had its meetings from 1802 to 1851. From 1815, the collection had expanded from books to include horological exhibits, among which an early acquisition was a set of pallets from an escapement by Alexander Cumming, bought by Vulliamy at auction, and which are still on display, on the Gillows bookcase. With the deaths of BL Vulliamy and George Atkins, Clerk to the Company, in the 1850s, the collection lost its key advocates and supporters, but the fortunes of the museum were reversed with the construction of a new building for Guildhall Library in the early 1870s. At the invitation of the Guildhall authorities, the Clockmakers’ Museum was moved there and opened to the public from 1873. A first catalogue was written by William Henry Overall in 1875. In 1891, The Rev Harry Leonard Nelthropp, a key supporter of the museum, persuaded the Company to acquire one of the most important items in the modern collection, John Harrison’s fifth marine timekeeper, H5. In 1894, Nelthropp donated his entire personal collection of watches, clocks, sundials, seals and related ephemera to the Museum. Charles Welch produced a new catalogue in 1902. In 1936, the Clockmakers asked the noted engineer and horologist Granville Hugh Baillie to create a new catalogue. Baillie rearranged the museum between mid-1937 and mid-1938. During the Second World War the collection was dismantled and stored off-site under the guidance of Guildhall Librarian James Lungley Douthwaite.Douthwaite report to the Court, Minutes of the Clockmakers Company (27 September 1945), LMA CLC/L/CD/B/001/MS02710/015 Baillie produced a guide in 1939 and updated the catalogue in 1949. The museum moved to the new Guildhall Library in 1976, and, in anticipation, Cecil Clutton and George Daniels produced a new catalogue of the clock and watch collection, while John Bromley, a Guildhall Librarian, produced a new catalogue of the Library collection. Arms of the Clockmakers' Company, granted in 1672 Under Cedric Jagger as Assistant Curator from 1974, and then as Keeper from 1980, the Museum underwent significant reorganization and improvement at Guildhall. Jagger was succeeded as Keeper by Sir George White in 1988, who served for thirty years through to 2018, in which time the museum and archive collection was again expanded. The major acquisitions in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century were the Hurle-Bath and Hurle-Bradley watch collections, and the purchase of a significant cache of original John Harrison manuscript documents. With a major bequest by noted collector and Past-Master of the Company Reginald Gowan Beloe TD, the funds were available for a major rebuild of the museum, which reopened with a new and enlarged display organized by White at Guildhall Library in 2001. When its lease finally expired at Guildhall, White was instrumental in securing the offer by Ian Blatchford of a newly designed gallery at the Science Museum, which it now occupies under a thirty-year lease. The collection was moved over the course of 2014–15, and the new gallery was opened by the Princess Royal on 22 October 2015. The new gallery is more than twice the size of the earlier gallery at Guildhall. Visitor numbers in the decade prior to 2014 were of the order of 13,000 per annum, but since the move to the Science Museum numbers have expanded significantly, in view of the more than 3 million visitors to the London Science Museum site each year.Science Museum Group Annual Report 2018–19 The move of the Clockmakers Museum to the Science Museum formed part of the updating and improvement of the Science Museum second floor galleries, where it adjoins the Mathematics Gallery (designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, opened 2016) and Science City: 1500–1800 (designed by Gitta Gschwendtner, opened 2019). Library and archive Though the Museum has moved to South Kensington, the Library and Archive of the Clockmakers remains housed in the City of London, almost entirely at Guildhall Library, and open to the public (though material has to be requested from the store, and is not on open access). The presence of the Clockmakers' Library of printed books, alongside the library of the Antiquarian Horological Society contributes to making Guildhall Library a world-class centre for horological research resources. Printed books can be searched for using the Guildhall Library catalogue here. For genealogical and biographical research about watch and clockmakers, the Clockmakers' archives (catalogue here) include: *Apprentice bindings, 1694–1890 *Freedom admissions, 1631–1947 *Quarterage books, 1698–1850 (with gaps). These records can indicate a period of activity and sometimes the date of death. *Court minutes, 1632–1992. The minutes can include promotions to the livery, elections to the Court of Assistants and to offices, and requests for charitable assistance by members and their dependents. The collection The Clockmakers Museum displays in the London Science Museum The collection on display includes rare horological portraits, and numbers some 660 English and European watches, 30 clocks, and 15 marine timekeepers,http://www.clockmakers.org/the-clockmakers-museum-library/the- clockmakers-museum-library/ which are broadly arranged in chronological order, starting in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries at the east end (with some European objects), but soon moving to the seventeenth century and the emergence of a clock and watch trade in London, initially populated by immigrant craftsmen. The gallery moves forward in time as it progresses westwards through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and is completed at the west end by recent and current objects, such as watches made by and other items associated with George Daniels, a former Master of the Company, and an explanation of the wristwatch now being manufactured by Charles Frodsham in Sussex. To support horological education, the museum has an information board at the west end, emphasizing the possibilities for new students and entrants to the field of horology, particularly at West Dean College, Birmingham School of Jewellery, part of Birmingham City University, and the British School of Watchmaking. The chronological story set out in the gallery in information panels and labelling has been resolved into a single narrative account, The Clockmakers of London, by the Keeper Emeritus, George White, first published in 2000 and since revised in a new edition with high-resolution images (2018). John Harrison's H5 marine timekeeper Highlights include: *Star watch by David Ramsay *Clocks and watches by Edward East *Table clock by Samuel Knibb *Astronomical table clock by Samuel Watson, possibly belonging to Isaac Newton *Clocks and watches by Thomas Tompion *Watches and clocks by George Graham *Marine timekeeper by Henry Sully *Longcase clock by James Harrison *Longcase movements by John Harrison *Watch by John Jefferys, made for John Harrison, and on long-term loan to the Museum *John Harrison’s H5 marine timekeeper *Chronometers by John Arnold, and significant personal Arnold ephemera *Chronometers by Thomas Earnshaw *Watches by Abraham-Louis Breguet *Smiths wristwatch worn by Sir Edmund Hillary to the summit of Mount Everest *Watches by George Daniels, including the Space Traveller (on loan to the Museum) *Original portraits of many eminent clock and watchmakers In 2019 the museum acquired a large portrait (970mm x 800mm) in a silvered frame, showing a well- dressed gentleman holding a fine and complicated watch, dated perhaps to the 1670s. The watch is very similar to the astronomical watch, c.1660, by Nathaniel Barrow, shown in Case 7 in the museum. Accreditation The Museum was first admitted to the Registration scheme of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council. When this was amended to Accreditation, the Museum was invited to re-register, and achieved full accredited status in 2007. After suspending accredited status while the Museum closed for its move to South Kensington, it then reapplied once the museum reopened and was granted full Accredited status by Arts Council England in 2018.

In World War II, Fromm was Commander in Chief of the Replacement Army (Ersatzheer), in charge of training and personnel replacement for combat divisions of the German Army, a position he occupied for most of the war. A recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, he was executed for failing to act against the plot of 20 July 1944 to assassinate Hitler. Early life Fromm was born in Charlottenburg. He served as a Prussian Army officer during World War I.  Head of the Reserve Army  In 1939, Fromm became Chief of Army Equipment and commander of the Replacement Army. When Operation Barbarossa stalled outside of Moscow in December 1941 and the Russian counter- attack started, Hitler took direct command of the Army and re-organized the armed forces' command structure. The Office of the Chief of Army Armament and the Reserve Army under Generaloberst Friedrich Fromm was created, subordinate to the commander in chief, army (head of the OKH, Hitler). Fromm had enough power at his disposal to control the German state because his position controlled army procurement and production and commanded all army troops inside Germany. At the beginning of 1942, Fromm apparently recommended going over to the defensive for the entire year because of exhausted army stockpiles and the diversion of production, after the initial successes of Barbarossa in the summer of 1941. 20 July plot Though Fromm was aware that some of his subordinates, most notably Claus von Stauffenberg, his chief of staff, were planning an assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler, he remained quiet and agreed to have a part in it in exchange for becoming a top official of the new government after the coup. However, Fromm did not have any direct involvement in the conspiracy. When the attempt to proceed with a mutiny on 15 July 1944 failed, he refused to have any further part in it. On 20 July, news broke that Hitler and several officers of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces had become victims of an explosion in the German military's headquarters on the Eastern Front, the Wolfsschanze (Wolf's Lair), near Rastenburg, East Prussia (now Kętrzyn, Poland). Fromm quickly concluded that it was Stauffenberg and the plotters who were behind the explosion, and when he attempted to arrest them, Fromm was quickly overwhelmed and confined to a prison cell in the Bendlerblock, the Berlin headquarters of the Replacement Army, among other branches of the German military, after he had refused to join the plotters in Operation Valkyrie (they had forged Fromm's signature to begin the operation). After the coup failed, Fromm was found by men of the Ersatzheer and freed. Despite Hitler's direct orders to take the conspirators alive, Fromm held a summary court-martial of the active soldiers at his headquarters who had been identified or suspected of being part of the coup. As presiding official, Fromm condemned the officers to death and ordered their immediate execution by firing squad. As for retired Colonel-General Ludwig Beck, Fromm allowed his request to commit suicide, but since the suicide attempt failed, Fromm ordered him to be shot. Arrest, trial and execution After the Bendlerblock executions, Fromm went to Goebbels to claim credit for suppressing the coup, to which Goebbels only said, \\"You have been in a damn hurry to get your witnesses below ground.\\"Mitcham, Samuel W., Hitler's Commanders: Officers of the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, the Kriegsmarine, and the Waffen-SS (page 31). Rowman & Littlefield, 2012 On the morning of 22 July 1944, Fromm was arrested by Nazi officials and locked in jail to await trial. It was clear to them that his actions immediately after the coup's collapse were more likely than not to have been an attempt to use his authority, despite Hitler's specific orders to the contrary, to silence the officers directly under his operational command who might have implicated him for at least \\"turning a blind eye\\" to their activities leading up to Hitler's assassination attempt. Fromm was discharged from the German Army on 14 September 1944. The civilian Fromm was sentenced to death and considered unworthy for military duty by the Volksgerichtshof on 7 March 1945. Since the court failed to prove a direct association with the 20 July plotters, he had been charged and convicted for cowardice before the enemy. However, because he had executed the conspirators within reach, he was spared torture and execution by hanging with a thin rope, and sentenced to a military execution. On 12 March 1945, Fromm was executed at the Brandenburg- Görden Prison by firing squad as part of the post-conspiracy purge. His last words before the firing squad were reported to be \\"I die, because it was ordered. I had always wanted only the best for Germany\\".Mueller, Gene: Generaloberst Friedrich Fromm. In: Gerd R.

Life  Bau was trained as a graphic artist at the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków, Poland. His education was interrupted by World War II and he was transferred to the Płaszów concentration camp in late 1942 from the Kraków Ghetto. Having a talent in gothic lettering, he was employed in the camp for making signs and maps for the Germans. While in Płaszów, Bau created a miniature - the size of his hand – illustrated book with his own poetry. He also forged documents and identity papers for people who managed to escape from the camp. During his imprisonment, Bau fell in love with another inmate, Rebecca Tennenbaum. They were secretly married, despite the prohibition by the Germans, in the women's barracks of Płaszów. This was dramatized in Steven Spielberg's Academy Award-winning movie Schindler's List, where he was played by Rami Heuberger. Bau himself appears in the film's epilogue placing a stone on Oskar Schindler's grave in Jerusalem, along with his wife Rebecca. After Płaszów, Bau was transferred to Gross-Rosen concentration camp and then to Schindler's camp where he stayed until the end of the war, while Rebecca was sent to Auschwitz. After liberation, Bau was reunited with his wife and finished his degree at University of Plastic Arts in Kraków. In 1950, he immigrated to Israel together with his wife and three-year-old daughter, Hadassah, where their other daughter, Clila, was born. He worked as a graphic artist at the Brandwein Institute in Haifa and for the government of Israel. Bau opened his own studio in 1956 in Tel Aviv, which is now a museum managed by daughters Hadassa and Clila. He was well known for creating graphic fonts and drawing titles for Israeli movies in the 1960s and 1970s. He also authored a number of Hebrew books and continued to write poetry. Bau's wife Rebecca died in 1997. Bau died from pneumonia in Tel Aviv on May 24, 2002, at age 81.  Works  The English version of Joseph Bau's memoir, Dear God, Have You Ever Gone Hungry? came out in June 1998. It was first published in Hebrew and Polish and was published in several languages, including Chinese. Joseph Bau also created his own animated films, for which he has been referred to in the press as the \\"Israeli Walt Disney\\" or as the \\"founder of Israel's animation industry\\". His paintings and drawings have been listed by Sotheby's as significant contributions to the art of the Holocaust and his works have been shown in galleries in New York, Baltimore, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Joseph Bau's art is filtered through the prism of his own experiences. It reflects both the brutal reality of life during the war, as well as the joy and humour he observed in later years in Israel. Joseph Bau was nominated for the prestigious Israel Prize in 1998.

Voznesensky was considered \\"one of the most daring writers of the Soviet era\\" but his style often led to regular criticism from his contemporaries and he was once threatened with expulsion by Nikita Khrushchev. He performed poetry readings in front of sold-out stadiums around the world, and was much admired for his skilled delivery. Some of his poetry was translated into English by W. H. Auden. Voznesenky's long-serving mentor and muse was Boris Pasternak, the Nobel Laureate and the author of Doctor Zhivago. Before his death, he was both critically and popularly proclaimed \\"a living classic\\", and \\"an icon of Soviet intellectuals\\". Personal life Voznesensky was born in Moscow. His father was a professor of engineering, while his mother influenced him early on by reading poetry in his presence. His father worked during World War II. In his early life, Voznesensky was fascinated with painting and architecture, in 1957 graduating from the Moscow Architectural Institute with a degree in engineering. His enthusiasm for poetry, though, proved to be stronger. While still a teenager, he sent his poems to Boris Pasternak; the friendship between the two had a strong influence on the young poet, and he later described this relationship in \\"I Am Fourteen\\" – \\"From that day on, my life took on a magical meaning and a sense of destiny; his new poetry, telephone conversations, Sunday chats at his house from 2 to 4, walks—years of happiness and childish adoration\\". Pasternak, who died in 1960, paid him the ultimate tribute – \\"Your entrance into literature was swift and turbulent. I am glad I've lived to see it\\". In later years Voznesensky became reclusive in nature. He suffered a stroke several years before his death. He is believed to have endured another stroke in early 2010. On June 1, 2010, Voznesensky died at the age of 77. The secretary of Russian Union of Writers, Gennady Ivanov, announced that he had died in his home in a peaceful manner. A cause of death went unprovided. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev wrote a letter of condolences. A telegram by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Voznesensky had \\"truly become a person of dominant influence\\". Other senior Russian officials and cultural entities also offered many tributes. Voznesensky's wife, Zoya Boguslavskaya, outlived him. He was buried in the Moscow Novodevichi Cemetery on 4 June 2010. Career Voznesensky's style was considered different from his contemporaries in the Soviet Union. His first poems were published in 1958, and these immediately reflected his unique style. His lyrics are characterized by his tendency \\"to measure\\" the contemporary person by modern categories and images, by the eccentricity of metaphors, by the complex rhythmical system and sound effects. Vladimir Mayakovsky and Pablo Neruda have been cited among the poets who influenced him most. The Goya-inspired \\"I Am Goya\\" was an early Voznesensky effort, and went on to achieve considerable recognition for its impressions of the fear and horror attached to war, as demonstrated by its Russian metaphors and recurring \\"g\\" sounds. Another early poem, \\"Fire in the Architecture Institute\\", was inspired by a 1957 night fire at the Institute of Architecture in Moscow. Voznesensky later said: \\"I believe in symbols. I understood that architecture was burned out in me. I became a poet\\". Voznesensky was one of several young Russian intellectuals whom Nikita Khrushchev invited to a reception hosted by the ruling Communist Party in December 1962. Khrushchev scathingly remarked on Voznesensky at the ceremony: \\"Just look at this new Pasternak! You want to get a [foreign] passport tomorrow? You want it? And then go away, go to the dogs! Go, go there\\". In 1963, his fame blossomed and he became \\"as popular as The Beatles\\" after Khrushchev publicly and falsely branded him a pervert. In the 1960s, during the so-called Thaw, Voznesensky frequently travelled abroad: to France, Germany, Italy, the United States and other countries. The popularity of Voznesensky, Yevgeny Yevtushenko and Bella Akhmadulina was marked by their performances in front of the adoring crowds numbering in the thousands at stadiums, in concert halls and universities. In doing so, he served as \\"a sort of unofficial Kremlin cultural envoy\\", according to The New York Times. His poetry reading skills were profound. He competed with Laurence Olivier and Paul Scofield at one show in London. He criticised the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia. While in the United States, he met Allen Ginsberg, Arthur Miller, and Marilyn Monroe. Voznesensky's friendship with many contemporary writers, artists and other intellectuals is reflected in his poetry and essays. He is known to wider audiences for the superhit Million of Scarlet Roses that he penned for Alla Pugacheva in 1984 and for the hugely successful rock opera Juno and Avos (1979), based on the life and death of Nikolay Rezanov. His creations have been turned into works of theatre. One collection of his poems, \\"Antimiry\\" (\\"Anti-worlds\\") served as the basis for a famous performance at the Taganka Theater in 1965. \\"Save your Faces\\" was performed at the same venue. \\"Juno and Avos\\" was performed at the Lenin's Komsomol Theater (now Lenkom).

It was a popular form of luggage in the United States and Europe in the 19th century, featuring simple handles and only an upper frame, which served as its closure. Some small modern versions are used as handbags or purses.  History  The carpet bag was invented as a type of inexpensive personal baggage light enough for a passenger to carry, like a duffel bag, as opposed to a large rigid wooden or metal trunk, which required the assistance of porters. In 1886, the Scientific American described it as old-fashioned and reliable, \\"still unsurpassed by any, where rough wear is the principal thing to be studied. Such a bag, if constructed of good Brussels carpeting and unquestionable workmanship, will last a lifetime, provided always that a substantial frame is used.\\"Scientific American Supplement, No. 561, 2 October 1886 ebook: John T. Humphrey \\"Useful Bags and How to Make Them\\" Pg. 49 Its use implied self-sufficiency: in Jules Verne's 1873 novel Around the World in Eighty Days, Phileas Fogg and Passepartout bring only a carpet bag as luggage, which holds a few items of clothing and a great deal of cash. Carpet bags used to be made of Oriental rugs or the Brussels carpet referred to above, with \\"a heavy pile formed by uncut loops of wool on a linen warp\\". Carpet was the chosen material because \\"remainder\\" pieces were easily bought for its manufacture. Some carpet bags could also serve as a \\"railway rug\\", a common item in the 19th century for warmth in drafty, unheated rail-cars. The rug could either be opened as a blanket, or latched up on the sides as a travelling bag.

This gave rise to limited new manufacture as a trendy fashion accessory.The Salt Lake Tribune, \\"Jerry Terrence brings back his popular bags from the '60s for a new generation\\" (13 February 2006)  Cultural impact  The carpetbaggers of the Reconstruction Era following the American Civil War—Northerners who moved to the South for economic or political opportunity—were given their name from often carrying only this type of luggage, implying they came with little while hoping to acquire lots.

In the game, the player controls a customized character to battle, trade, and manage a fief in the medieval land of Calradia. The game was developed by Armağan Yavuz and his wife İpek Yavuz, the founders of TaleWorlds Entertainment. The game was fully released on September 16, 2008, though alpha versions of the game were available prior to the full release. Mount & Blade initially received a mixed critical reception. Reviewers praised the game for its innovative combat mechanics, complex character skill system, and large modding community, but criticized it for its low graphics quality, as well as its repetitive dialogue and locations. A standalone expansion, Mount & Blade: Warband, was released in March 2010, and a spin-off expansion, Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword, was released in May 2011. A proper sequel, Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, was released in early access on March 30, 2020. Gameplay Map of Calradia Mount & Blade is a single-player, action-oriented role-playing game, which takes place in a medieval land named Calradia. The game features a sandbox gameplay style, and though the player can complete quests, there is no overarching storyline present. The player is able to join one of the five battling factions, fight as a mercenary, assume the role of an outlaw, or remain neutral. At the start of the game, the player is offered a set of options to customize the character. The player answers a series of multiple-choice questions about the character's past and sex, which generate the character's initial attributes. The player has the option to sculpt their character's facial features. Traveling to other locations, or interacting with other parties is done by pointing and clicking the desired destination. Upon encountering enemy parties, the player can try to avoid a conflict or can engage in a battle with them. In Mount & Blade each battle is attributed a renown value, according to the number and power of the members of each party. The player gains the renown points if he or she wins the battle. With a high enough renown, the player may be offered vassalage by the leaders of one of the five factions. By becoming a vassal, the player is given control over a certain fief, which they can manage and collect taxes from. By solving quests or defeating opponents the player is awarded experience points, which can be used to improve attributes, skills, and weapon proficiencies to further develop the character. Weapon proficiencies can be improved over time by inflicting damage on other opponents. =Combat= An enemy caravan running from the player. The numbers by the party indicate combatants and prisoners, respectively. There are four main areas where battles take place: on the open map when two or more hostile parties meet, in tournaments organized in town arenas, in siege combat where the player is either defending or attacking a fortification, or in settlements after triggering an event. Events include villages being infested by bandits, the player getting caught in a hostile settlement, the player plundering a village, or villagers rebelling against the player for collecting taxes. The number of soldiers each party can hold is limited by the \\"leadership\\" skill and the renown of the leader. Participants in a battle can be either mounted or on foot. The player has to indicate the direction in which he or she wants to swing by moving the mouse accordingly, unless they have changed the options so that the game automatically chooses it for them. Aiming with a ranged weapon is also done by using the mouse. The amount of damage is dependent on multiple factors including weapon's quality, weapon proficiency, and the speed of the player relative to the target: for example, a javelin thrown while running or riding a horse will be potentially more damaging than a javelin thrown while standing still. Weapons also have certain range of damage where they are most and least effective, giving each weapon type different playing styles. A spear will do minimal damage when used close to the player, while a hammer will cause maximum damage. Development and release The game originated as an independent project of Armağan Yavuz, founder of TaleWorlds Entertainment, and his wife, İpek Yavuz. The two began making the game in their garage, with Armağan working on code and İpek on graphics. According to Armağan, the game's inspirations include Sid Meier's Pirates!, The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, Frontier: Elite II, and older Koei strategy video games such as Genghis Khan, as well as historical fiction novels, particularly those by Bernard Cornwell. Prior to its retail release, alpha versions of the game were published on the developer's website beginning in 2004, and feedback was given to the developers. On January 2008, Paradox Entertainment announced they would publish the game and scheduled to release within the second quarter of that year. The game was released on Microsoft Windows via Steam on September 16, 2008. TaleWorlds Entertainment produced a standalone expansion for the game, titled Mount & Blade: Warband, which includes multiplayer support with up to 250 players as well as improved diplomacy, graphics, and artificial intelligence. Warband also has an updated map and a sixth faction. The expansion was set to be released in Q3 2009, but was delayed until March 2010. Closed beta testing began on August 2009, and became open in February 2010, before the sequel's release on March 30, 2010. Paradox Interactive, returned the Mount & Blade license to TaleWorlds Entertainment on January 31, 2014. Reception Mount & Blade received a score of 72 out of 100 based on 28 critic reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Reviewers acknowledged the game's potential, but also said it suffers from poor production values. GameSpot concluded that the game \\"feels more underdeveloped than it does flat-out bad\\", and Eurogamer made a similar review, saying that Mount & Blade has \\"foundations [...] for something really quite special, but in its current state the game is nowhere close to delivering on its promises\\". Beyond the combat, little of the game was praised by most reviewers. IGN in contrast, praised the game, stating, \\"Mount & Blade may be the best game about medieval life ever made\\". GamePro also gave a positive review and calling it, \\"the first, great medieval role- playing game\\". Mount & Blade has received negative criticism for its repetitive dialogues and locations, as well as its graphics quality. IGN criticized the world map and character models, calling them crude and awkward. However, also praised the combat animation and load times of the game. GameSpot criticized the dialogue in the game, stating that conversations with NPCs feel more like \\"consulting a travel guidebook for Calradia than actually speaking to a human being\\", as well as calling much of the landscape \\"very, very ugly\\". In addition, GameSpot saw faults in the lack of variety among NPC types and towns, saying that \\"one medieval architect seems to have designed the entire land.\\" Eurogamer had similar criticisms, stating that the towns and villages all look like copies and the NPCs all share the same line of text. When reviewing the combat, it received more positive commentary from multiple reviewers. Eurogamer, IGN, and GamePro praised the combat for being physics- based and aim-based, as opposed to many other RPGs. Gamespot stated that it was \\"the one place where Mount & Blade truly shines,\\" and GamePro called it \\"far and above the best rendition of medieval warfare yet put onto computer screens.\\" PC Zone, however, criticized the melee combat and claimed that it felt random in its effectiveness on both foot and horseback. The complexity and thoroughness of the character skill system was also well received. The fan community has received positive attention from both developers and critics. During an interview, TaleWorlds Entertainment stated to be \\"most proud\\" of its community, considering that \\"Mount & Blade has arguably some of the best mods developed for a computer game\\". Reviewers such as GamePro and Game Industry News also admired the number of mods made available for the beta versions even before the game's official retail release. Follow-up and sequels Paradox released a spin-off titled Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword, based on the historical novel With Fire and Sword (Polish: Ogniem i Mieczem) by Henryk Sienkiewicz, developed by Snowberry Connection, Sich Studio, and TaleWorlds Entertainment. The game is set in Eastern Europe, and includes the playable factions Poland–Lithuania, Cossack Hetmanate, Russia, Sweden and the Crimean Khanate. The game was released on May 4, 2011. A sequel, Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, was released on March 30, 2020, reaching over 170,000 concurrent players on Steam at its peak. The sequel features better graphics, character creation, battles, dialogue, relationship mechanics, and multiplayer.

The locality and bay lies to the north east of Cape Leeuwin which is the most south-westerly mainland point of the Australian Continent, in the state of Western Australia. Plaque at Point Matthew lookout on road to Cape Leeuwin Bay On Matthew Flinders Terra Australis Sheet 1 1801–1803 the area was originally known as Dangerous Bight. The bay runs from Point Matthew East North East of Cape Leeuwin to Ledge Point some east. It was named by either James Stirling or Septimus Roe in 1829 or 1830. Matthew Flinders was first in the Bay on 7 December 1801. Railway terminus and jetty View of Flinders Bay jetty 1899/1902 The name of the locality of Flinders Bay is tied to the small settlement that had been a whaling and fishing location, as well as the terminus of the Busselton to Flinders Bay Branch Railway railway line (1920s, closed 1957). The name is also tied to the Flinders Bay jetties (also known as the Barrack Point Jetties). The settlement was in the earlier days considered to be separate from Augusta but now is more or less the southern portion of the larger community. Boat harbour Augusta Boat Harbour entrance in 2013 The need for safe and efficient transfer of whale watchers and a safe mooring location in the Bay for fishermen has seen a proposal for a marina in 2004 which had included plans for the marina close to the old settlement of Flinders Bay. The 2005 revised proposal has moved to a bay further around towards Cape Leeuwin. The Flat Rock site is complete and has been called \\"Augusta Boat Harbour\\" by the department of Transport.http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/imarine/augusta-boat- harbour.aspAugusta Boat Harbour Whaling View of the Flinders Bay whaling and settlement from the north The landing area adjacent to the old railway station yard was originally known as \\"The Whaling\\". It was the area where boats would work from in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Up until the early 1970s sheds and ramps were still present. In the late 20th century the area had whale rescue operations occurring very close to the area. Also businesses involved in whale watching have more recently used the bay. Islands The St Alouarn Islands stretch out south of Point Matthew (on the road to Cape Leeuwin), and are effective barriers along with reefs for the outer reaches of the bay to the south. Climate Like the majority of the southwestern coastal regions of Western Australia, Flinders Bay experiences a cool-summer Mediterranean climate with cool to warm summers and mild, wet winters.  Abalone sea ranch  After trials in 2012, a world-first commercial \\"sea ranch\\" was set up in 2016, to raise abalone. The ranch is based on an artificial reef made up of 5000 () separate concrete units called abitats (abalone habitats). The abitats can host 400 abalone each. The reef is seeded with young abalone from an onshore hatchery. The abalone feed on seaweed that has grown naturally on the habitats. The ecosystem enrichment of the bay also results in growing numbers of dhufish, pink snapper, wrasse, samson fish and other species. The company emphasises the similarity to wild abalone and the difference from shore based aquaculture. \\"We're not aquaculture, we're ranching, because once they're in the water they look after themselves.\\" View of the head of the bay from the ridge to the west, Blackwood River to the left NotesReferences *Fornasiero, Jean; Monteath, Peter and West-Sooby, John.

It breeds in most of South America except for dense forests and areas of high altitude such as mountains. Since 1900 the shiny cowbirds' range has shifted northward, and it was recorded in the Caribbean islands as well as the United States, where it is found breeding in southern Florida. It is a bird associated with open habitats, including disturbed land from agriculture and deforestation. Adults are sexually dimorphic. Males are all black with a purple-blue iridescence. The female is smaller, with dull brown plumage that is sometimes paler on the underparts. Females of the species can be distinguished from the female brown-headed cowbird by their longer, finer bills and flatter heads. The shiny cowbird's diet consists mainly of insects and seeds, and they have been recorded foraging for grains in cattle troughs. Like most other cowbirds, it is an obligate brood parasite, laying its eggs in the nests of many other bird species such as the rufous-collared sparrow. Different host species show different responses to their nests being parasitised, with behaviours ranging from accepting and caring for the cowbird eggs, to rejecting the eggs from the nest. As the shiny cowbird is an effective generalist brood parasite, it can be considered the South American counterpart to the brown-headed cowbird.  Taxonomy  The shiny cowbird is a passerine in the family Icteridae, which includes the blackbirds. The species was first described in 1789 by Johann Friedrich Gmelin. It has seven described subspecies due to geographic variation:Blake, E. R. (1968). Family Icteridae, pp. 138-202. In R. A. Paynter, Jr. (ed.), Checklist of birds of the world, vol. 14. Mus. Comp. Zool., Cambridge, MA * Molothrus bonariensis bonariensis (Gmelin, 1789) - Eastern and southern Brazil, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, and introduced in Chile. * Molothrus bonariensis cabanisii (Cassin, 1866) - Eastern Panama, western Colombia, eastern Andes, and southeastern Colombia. * Molothrus bonariensis aequatorialis (Chapman, 1915) - southwestern Colombia, western Ecuador, Guayaquil, and Puná Island. * Molothrus bonariensis occidentalis (Berlepsch and Stolzmann, 1892) - Extreme southwestern Ecuador, western Peru and northen Chile. * Molothrus bonariensis venezuelensis (Stone, 1891) - Eastern Colombia and northern Venezuela. * Molothrus bonariensis minimus (Dalmas, 1900) - Lesser Antilles, Tobago, Trinidad, Guianas, extreme northern Brazil, West Indies, Carriacou, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti), Cuba, and Florida. * Molothrus bonariensis riparius (Griscom and Greenway, 1937) - Lower Amazon Valley and eastern Peru.  Description  Physical appearance of the shiny cowbird adult depends on subspecies. Sizes range from 31-40 grams in mass and 18 cm in length (M. b. minimus), to 55-65 grams in mass and 22 cm in length (M. b. cabanisii). Basic adult plumage for M. b. bonariensis is black with purple-blue iridescence for males, and dusty gray-brown for females. M. b. cabanisii males have plumage similar to M. b. bonariensis, while females are paler in colouration. M. b. aequatorialis males have violet iridescence and females are dark in colour. M. b. occidentalis males have rich purple iridescence, and females are distinct compared to the other subspecies as they have a pale upper body and very pale, streaked underparts. M. b. venezuelensis males look similar to M. b. occidentalis, and females dark in colour. M. b. minimus males look similar to M. b. bonariensis, and females have a darker head than M. b. bonariensis and have streaked scapulars and inter-scapulars. M. b. riparius males are similar to M. b. bonariensis, and the females have darker upper bodies and paler underparts than M. b. bonariensis.Female shiny cowbirdUpon hatching, shiny cowbirds are altricial and are confined to their nests. Hatchlings are covered in a gray down. Juvenile males are dark on their upper body, with dull dray underparts streaked with dark brown or black, and a buff abdomen. Females are a buff brown colour on top, with light buff, brown, or gray underparts that may or may not be streaked with brown. Eggs are ovate in shape, and can exist as either a spotted morph, or an unspotted \\"immaculate\\" morph. They are usually white in colour, though they sometimes take on a light blue, light gray, or buff hue.  Distribution and habitat  The shiny cowbird is a year-round resident across most of South America, where it lives in open areas such as open forests and cultivated land. Within the last century, the range of the species has shifted northward, and birds have been recorded in the West Indies and southern Florida. This shift in range is due to increased human conversion of forests into open cultivated and agricultural land, habitats which are preferred by the shiny cowbird. This range shift into new regions allows the cowbird to exploit new naive host species. = Effect of deforestation = Grouping of malesDeforestation and conversion of forested land to open agricultural fields and pastures has led to a northward shift in the range of the shiny cowbird, as this species prefers open habitats. These deforested areas may be home to host species that were previously not parasitized by cowbirds. These naive hosts likely do not have defenses against parasitism, and may be more negatively affected by the presence of the cowbirds. The species spread from South America to mainland Puerto Rico in 1955, and subsequently reached the Dominican Republic in 1973, and Cuba in 1982. Since 1985, the shiny cowbird has been recorded in Florida.  Behaviour and ecology  Breeding  Sexual behaviour and courtship  Shiny cowbirds do not form monogamous pairs. They have a promiscuous mating system where individuals will copulate with many different mates. During courtship, male shiny cowbirds perform a song while circling a female, and when the song is finished they bow to their prospective mate. This bow is a display used in both mating rituals and as a show of aggression toward other males. It consists of the male ruffling his feathers while arching his wings and lowering his tail. The display is performed either on the ground, in a tree, or while flying. Following a successful mating display, the pair will copulate once.  Brood parasitism  The shiny cowbird is an obligate brood parasite, meaning that adults will lay their eggs in the nests of other species and their offspring rely entirely on their hosts for parental care. They are generalists, and have about 250 different host species. As a host generalist, their young are non-mimetic, meaning they do not attempt to replicate the behaviours of host chicks like a host specialist species might. In regions of South America including Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Venezuela, the main host species of the shiny cowbird is the rufous-collared sparrow. Female shiny cowbirds do not build nests, as they rely on their hosts to care for their offspring, but they will preferentially select hosts that build enclosed nests such as nests built in cavities. They will look for host nests both actively, and by silently watching for hosts. When a host nest is found, they will flush the host away from the nest by noisily flying around the area. An individual shiny cowbird may lay its eggs across many different nests.alt= = Host response = Responses to parasitic eggs and chicks in the nest varies among hosts. Sometimes even within a host species, the response to parasitism is context-dependent. For example, when grayish baywings were acting as host parents to shiny cowbird young, cowbirds would only continue to receive parental care after they fledged if they had been raised alone in the nest without any baywing nest mates. Yellow warblers have been recorded to reject shiny cowbird eggs around 40% of the time, either by deserting their nest or building a new nest on top of the parasitised one. In hosts such as the creamy-bellied thrush, where parasitism by shiny cowbirds does not have a large negative effect on the survival of their own chicks, the hosts do not exhibit egg-ejection behaviour. This acceptance of parasitic eggs may also be due to the fact that the eggs are similar in appearance, and the host would risk harming its own eggs in the process. = Effect on host species = Masked water Tyrant in Brazil Brood parasitism from shiny cowbirds will have a negative effect on the reproductive success of their hosts through a variety of factors employed by the different life stages of the cowbird. Adult females can negatively affect the host by pecking and killing host eggs and removing the host eggs from the nest. Shiny cowbird eggs have a short incubation period of about 10-11 days. Many of the parasite's hosts have eggs that incubate for longer. One of their main hosts across much of South America, the rufous-collared sparrow, has an incubation period of 12-13 days. The shiny cowbird will sometimes also lay an egg before the host species begins laying. Laying their eggs before their host, as well as having a shorter incubation period, allows for the hatching of the parasitic chick to occur before the host eggs hatch. When the cowbirds hatch before the sparrows in the nest, sparrows usually do not gain much weight and die within about three days. In one study, nestling mortality almost doubled when comparing a non-parasitised nest to one that had been parasitised by a shiny cowbird. Shiny cowbirds can have a large negative effect on critically endangered species, such as the pale-headed brush finch. Human modification of their restricted geographic range led to habitat loss in the case of the finches, but also introduced more cowbirds into the now open area. Parasitism by shiny cowbirds is thought to be an important factor in the population decline of the pale-headed brush finch.  References Further readingBooks= *Pereira, J.F.M. 2008.

The current baktun started on 13.0.0.0.0 — December 21, 2012 using the GMT correlation. Archaeologist J. Eric S.

Even so, the practice is so well established among Maya epigraphers and other students of the Maya, that to change it would cause more harm than its perpetuation. The current practice of referring to the current baktun as ”baktun 13” or “thirteenth baktun” may stand, even though it is properly the fourteenth baktun.

Barros Luco was born in 1835 in Santiago, Barros Luco was son of Ramón Luis Barros Fernández and Dolores Luco Fernández de Leiva. He graduated from Law School in 1858. He died in Santiago in 1919. He was elected representative for the city of Casablanca in 1861, and from then on occupied a seat in the Lower House, being elected representative for Caldera (1867–70), Curicó (1870–73), Valparaíso (1873–76, and 1888–91), as well as for Santiago, during four separate terms, between 1876-1894. Later, he was elected senator for Linares (1900–06). In his position as President of the House of Deputies in 1891, he endorsed the move to dismiss the then President of the Republic, José Manuel Balmaceda, a move drawn up by the Congress. In addition, he lent his support to the uprising of the National Army, whose movements he oversaw, (alongside Waldo Silva, vice-president of the Senate), until they took their place in the government in Iquique. The revolution having succeeded, he resumed his functions as a parliamentarian, performing as a minister on several occasions, whenever the situation called for, \\"someone who posed no threat to anybody\\". In 1910, given the existing tensions between liberals and nationals in the debate over a common candidate, he was chosen as the representative for both parties. His career to date assured both parties that, if he were to be elected, their interests would remain unharmed. Government The philosophy of Barros Luco's government can be summarised with the following phrase, well known in Chile, \\"99% of problems solve themselves, and the remaining 1% have no solution\\" (\\"El 99% de los problemas se resuelven solos y el 1% restante no tiene solución\\"). He applied this maxim to his administration, which would be consumed by the machinations of the parliament at large, the propensity of which was to delay or hinder the government under any pretense, including the most trivial claim of a minor deputy. However, Barros Luco cannot be accused of mere acceptance and reluctance to act, as he possessed a plan to counter the aforementioned political strategy of accusations and delays, and subsequent frequent change of ministers, known as the \\"rotativa\\". His policy was as follows: anytime a deputy placed an accusation against a minister leading to said minister's downfall, the accusing deputy would be called upon to head the new cabinet. His hopes were dashed however, as this \\"rotary\\" system arrived at a total of 15 ministers, the first of whom lasted only 18 days in office, and the last of whom failed even to appear before Congress, the previous minister having resigned only days before the handover of government. Some deputies, led by the liberal Manuel Rivas Vicuña, tried to correct the parliamentary vices, with the support of Pres. Barros Luco. In 1912 he approved a modification to the system of parliamentary debate (in particular the system to finish debates), however if a large enough group opposed a motion or accused a minister, parliament could still be severely delayed. Meanwhile, the corruption amongst the political parties had reached alarming levels, in answer to which laws against fraud were approved in 1914 and 1915, in addition to a reform of the municipal system, which managed to eliminate the falsification of results, allowing for greater transparency. However this reform brought with it an unexpected negative side effect: an increase in electoral bribery. Barros Luco also focused his efforts on public works; during his term of office he initiated the construction of the port of San Antonio, in addition to the construction of roads, bridges, drinking water and sewers. Also, the national School of Engineering, Museum of History, National Archives, School of Aviation and the Arica-La Paz railway were built during his tenure as President. However, the large majority of works during his time represented the completion of projects begun by Pedro Montt Montt, fulfilling a promise of Montt's, \\"like the tale of a child with an egg. Another started the work, and no one will know in the end to whom the credit is due. They will end up by paying graditude to the one who has had the least to do with the project\\" (Pres. Montt was reputed to have complained thus as he laid the cornerstone of the National Library of Chile). Foreign policy On the international scene, on 25 May 1915, he signed the ABC Pact. This pact, signed between the so-called \\"ABC Powers\\" (Argentina, Brazil and Chile), was a means to combat the influence of the United States in the region, as well as to establish an equilibrium and channels of communication between the three signatories. The official name of the pact was the Non-Aggression, Consultation and Arbitration pact. During his government the First World War broke out, with Chile adopting a neutral position. While this position would bring initial economic benefits, in the long term the consequences were dire; although the price of salitre (sodium nitrate) had risen due to European demand, the limitation of salitre exports to Germany would mean that, apart from losing a valuable market, Chile would also lose their natural monopoly as a result of the development of synthetic salitre. This would spell the beginning of the end of the salitre industry in Chile. Namesake sandwich Barros Luco used to eat a particular sandwich often, which became known as a Barros Luco. The sandwich is made with a slab of steak or multiple slices of beef with melted cheese, prepared on the grill and served hot. It is available today in most restaurants throughout Chile.

He also served as Acting president for a few months in 1910. Biography Figueroa was born on July 12, 1866 in Santiago, son of Francisco de Paula Figueroa Araoz and of Rosalía Larraín Echeverría. He studied in the San Ignacio School and then went on to study law at the State University. He graduated in 1889 and that same year was named secretary to the Intendant of Santiago. Figueroa decided to embark on a political career and joined the Liberal Democratic Party, which supported a stronger executive. He was elected deputy for Victoria and Melipilla in 1900 and reelected in 1903. In 1907, once his term had ended, he was selected to replace Juan José Valenzuela, deputy for Rere and Puchacay, who had died in July that year. In 1909, Figueroa was once again elected to the Chamber of Deputies, this time representing Itata. On October 25, 1907, President Pedro Montt named Figueroa Minister of Justice, a position which he kept until September 15, 1909. President Montt died on August 16, 1910 and was replaced by his Minister of Interior, Elías Fernández Albano, who became acting president. Fernández named Figueroa Minister of Interior but died on September 6 that very year. Figueroa then replaced Fernández as acting president and stayed in that position until December 23, when Ramón Barros Luco was inaugurated as President. Barros named Figueroa to the post of ambassador to Spain in 1911, and in 1914 became ambassador to Argentina. Figueroa was considered a harmless politician and the three major political parties in Chile, Conservative, Liberal, and Radical, chose him as a consensus candidate for the 1925 Chilean presidential election. The purpose of having a single candidate was to avoid political campaigning in the volatile political situation the country was in. Nevertheless, leftist José Santos Salas ignored the three parties' agreement and declared his candidacy, backed by the Social Republican Worker's Union. Figueroa easily defeated Salas and became president on 23 December 1925. Figueroa kept the ambitious General Carlos Ibáñez as Minister of War, and later named him Minister of the Interior. In 1927, Ibáñez ordered the arrest of Figueroa's brother Javier Ángel, President of the Supreme Court. Unable to withstand the political pressure, Figueroa resigned and Ibáñez became acting president. After winning the presidential election that year with 98% of the vote, Ibáñez became President and wielded dictatorial powers. Ibáñez named Figueroa ambassador to Peru in 1928. Upon his return in 1929, Figueroa became president of the Central Bank of Chile. He died in a car accident on May 15, 1931.  References  * San Francisco, Alejandro, and Ángel Soto, eds.

These stories were also published in The Complete Fairy Tales of Hermann Hesse in 1995 with a new English translation by Jack Zipes. Two of the stories' English titles changed with this new translation: *\\"Strange News from Another Star\\" became \\"Strange News from Another Planet\\" *\\"The Hard Passage\\" became \\"The Difficult Path\\" Background These stories were written prior to and during the First World War and brought Hesse into conflict with supporters of the war, his country and its government. Unlike his earlier works, these stories do not lend themselves to rational interpretation. They are essentially fairy tales dealing with dream worlds, the subconscious and magic.

It is the third book in The Deptford Histories trilogy, a series of prequels to Jarvis's Deptford Mice books. It was first published in 1995 by Macdonald Young Books. Plot summary Four years after the events of The Final Reckoning, midshipmouse Thomas Triton is troubled by memories of a traumatic incident in his youth that resulted in the death of his best friend, Woodget Pipple. His wife Gwen suggests that it would make him feel better if he wrote down what was bothering him. Many years prior, Thomas is taken in by a kindly community of field mice after being caught in a snowstorm. There he meets Woodget Pipple, a little field mouse who becomes his close friend, and a beautiful maiden named Bess Sandibrook. Thomas falls deeply in love with Bess, but is unaware that Woodget has similar feelings for her. Stating that she loves Woodget, Bess gently rejects Thomas, only for them both to realise that Woodget has run away after mistakenly thinking he's getting in the way of their romance. Thomas vows to find Woodget, and catches up with him at a dock as a ship called the Calliope is getting ready to set sail. Thomas and Woodget meet a tough Irish mouse named Mulligan, who invites them to have a drink with him on the ship before he leaves. But they stay too long and to their dismay are stuck on the ship. The two become suspicious of Mulligan, who is evasive and will not let anyone see the contents of a satchel he always carries with him. The Calliope eventually crashes in a violent storm, killing most of its passengers. Mulligan washes ashore in Crete with Dimlon, a simple-minded young mouse Thomas and Woodget befriended during the voyage. Dimlon reveals himself to Mulligan as Dahrem Ruhar, an adept of the Scale, an evil cult that worships a reptile god called Suruth Scarophion. It is revealed that Mulligan has been carrying a piece of a jade egg sacred to the Scale, trying to prevent them from obtaining it and joining it with the other pieces, which would create a vessel into which Scarophion can be reborn. Thomas and Woodget survived the storm as well, and come onto the island in time to see a dying Mulligan, poisoned by the blades of Dahrem. He has carried the egg fragment with him and pushes it into the horrified Woodget's paws, telling him to take it to a place called Hara. Thomas and Woodget are discovered by an army of Indian mongooses who demand to know where they got the egg fragment from. After they explain the situation, the mongooses offer to take the two mice to Hara, their home city in India so they can speak to the sadhu and ask his advice. Dahrem, once again in the guise of Dimlon, comes along with them. Upon their arrival in Hara, Thomas, Woodget and Chattan go to see the sadhu, who also possesses a piece of the jade egg of Scarophion. In the night, the Scale arrive and launch a vicious attack on the city of Hara to steal the fragment. To everyone's shock, it is the sadhu himself who opens the gates for the Scale to enter. Dahrem attacks Woodget in the sadhu's chamber, demanding that he hand over the egg fragment Mulligan gave him. Thomas and the mongoose warrior Chattan hear the field mouse's screams and come to his rescue. Chattan engages in battle with Dahrem. The adept is killed, but not before poisoning Chattan with his blades. Faced with nowhere else to go, Thomas and Woodget decide to head to Singapore, where it is said that the jerboa prophet Simoon has journeyed. In a seedy bar called the Lotus Parlour, Thomas accidentally lets it slip to the bar's owner, Ma Skillet, that he and Woodget have the final egg fragment. Simoon is present and scolds the two mice for having walked directly into Scale territory. The bar is full of members of the cult (including Ma Skillet, the high priestess) who capture Thomas, Woodget, and Simoon and take them to their temple. The high priest joins the egg fragments together, and it appears Suruth Scarophion will be reborn. But as the reptilian form writhes within the newly created egg, it suddenly shrivels and dies. Simoon reveals that it was the plan all along to let the Scale obtain all the pieces of the egg, as he and other members of the Green Council like the sadhu knew it would ultimately be useless. The fragment held by Mulligan was periodically moved to different Green shrines, and thus gradually became a holy object. Cast from the egg, Scarophion's spirit enters a nearby statue in his image. Riding on its back, the enraged high priest chases Thomas, Woodget, and Simoon. The statue is destroyed when it crashes on a crag of rock, and Woodget kills the high priest to save Thomas's life. At the end of the journey, Thomas and Woodget are at a dock in Singapore waiting for a ship to take them back to England. An old beggar approaches them, but soon they discover that it is Ma Skillet, former high priestess of the Scale. She puts Thomas into a trance, during which he picks up Woodget and casts him into the water. Despite the field mouse's pleas, Thomas lets him presumably drown. Hours later, Thomas emerges from the trance and to his horror, remembers what he has done. He screams in anguish. In present day Hara, Chattan's sister Sobhan is taking her grandson to see the sadhu. She tries to help the latter remember his former identity, but he responds that Zenna, the siren who rescued him from the sea, wiped his memory completely and he is content that way. The final line reveals that this new sadhu is none other than Woodget. Development Robin Jarvis has stated that since he created the midshipmouse Thomas Triton, he has wanted to explore the character's dark past, hinted at in The Deptford Mice books: \\"In the original trilogy, he was always keeping some dark secret back until we finally learn that somehow he was responsible for the death of his best friend, Woodget. With that in mind I set about compiling his history and writing his memoirs.\\" For this novel, he wanted an entirely different sort of enemy, which is how he came up with the idea for the cult of the banished serpent god. Jarvis \\"found their habit of ripping their skins off to be quite revolting and terrifying, but its a perfectly logical and necessary thing for them to do.\\" Zenna, the siren who becomes infatuated with Woodget after he defends her from her mocking sisters, was named after the daughter of a librarian Jarvis met when he visited her school in Shropshire. Reception Regarding Thomas, Ilene Cooper of Booklist said \\"its archaic sentence structures and florid word choices are problematic, but series fans probably won't mind. They'll find the familiar mix of violent and heroic acts that has made the series popular.\\" Kirkus Reviews called it \\"a rousing tale of horror and heroism.\\" References Category:1995 British novels Category:Fantasy novels Category:Novels by Robin Jarvis Category:The Deptford Mice series Category:Fictional cults Category:Fictional mongooses Category:Novels set in India ","title":"Thomas (Jarvis novel)"},{"id":"2008189","text":"Jean Adair Swain (August 12, 1923 – July 17, 2000) was born in New York City and grew up in Port Washington, Long Island, where she graduated from high school at age 16.

It is located on the Chertsey Branch Line and is operated by South Western Railway. The station was opened, with the branch line, on 14 February 1848. It comprises Up and Down platforms having brick buildings: the main building being on the Down side. There is a level crossing with Station Road (B3121) on the south side of the station. Just under a mile south of the station, the line crosses the River Wey. After leaving the station southbound trains approach Addlestone Junction and can either head westward towards Byfleet and New Haw (and subsequent stations on the South Western Main Line) or head eastward to terminate at Weybridge. History Opened by the London and South Western Railway, it became part of the Southern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the Privatisation of British Railways. Services There is a direct half-hourly service at non-peak times from the station to Waterloo via Staines and Hounslow, although it is normally quicker to change at Virginia Water for a faster service. An alternative route to Waterloo is to change at Weybridge (Mondays to Saturdays) or Byfleet & New Haw (Sundays and early mornings/late evenings only) on the South Western Main Line.

Sheafe (1884?–1949) and Thornton Whitney Allen (1890-1944)—wrote the college song \\"Washington and Lee Swing.\\" Sheafe wrote the tune in 1905, Allen set the music down on paper in 1909 and Robbins provided the words. The completed version was published in 1910. Robbins authored two short story collections and several novels.

Robbins's Mysterious Martin (1912) is an early novel about a serial killer. His novel The Unholy Three (1917) was twice adapted for the screen, a silent version directed by Tod Browning in 1925 and a sound version directed by Jack Conway in 1930; both adaptations starred Lon Chaney. Robbins was also the author of the short story \\"Spurs\\", which Browning used as the basis for Freaks (1932), a film which later developed a cult following. Some of Robbins's work was later reprinted in the \\"Creeps\\" series of horror anthologies edited by Charles Birkin.

It was formerly named white-browed blackbird but is not closely related to the red-winged blackbird group.http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCRecentChanges.htm The white-browed meadowlark breeds in north-eastern Brazil and in southern South America from south-western Brazil through Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina. Southern populations are partially migratory. Like other meadowlarks, it is a bird associated with open country, including moist grasslands, pasture and cultivation, preferably with the odd bush or fence post for males to use as a songpost. In display the male flies up to 10 m in the air, then parachutes down on folded wings whilst singing an initially buzzing song, followed by a series of notes TZZZZZZ-teee-chu-chu-chak-chak. The call is a short chuck. The white-browed meadowlark builds a deep grass-lined open cup nest on the ground amongst tall grasses, with several nests often close together. The normal clutch is three to five reddish brown-blotched greenish eggs. This species is often parasitised by the shiny cowbird, and on one occasion 19 cowbird eggs were found with one meadowlark egg in a nest. The white-browed meadowlark is a small icterid. The male has mainly black plumage, apart from a bright red throat, belly and wing epaulets, and a white supercilium. The female has buff edged dark brown upperpart feathers, buff underparts, and pale streaks through the crown and eye. Juveniles resemble the female, but are paler. This species is very closely related to the red-breasted meadowlark, L. militaris, which breeds further north, and was formerly considered to be subspecies of that bird. The male white-browed is easily distinguished by his bright white supercilium, but females of the two species are almost identical. The female red-breasted meadowlark is longer billed, smaller, and shorter winged than the white-browed, with more red and less streaking on the underparts. This gregarious bird feeds mainly on insects and some seeds, including rice, and forages on the ground like a bobolink. The white-browed meadowlark has benefited from the more open habitat created by forest clearance and ranching, and is extending its range.

It is a pre-metric French unit based on the Roman actus. It is used in Quebec, some areas of the United States that were part of French Louisiana, and in Mauritius and the Seychelles. Etymology The word arpent is believed to derive from the Late Latin arepennis (equal to half a jugerum), which in turn comes from the Gaulish *are-penno- (\\"end, extremity of a field\\"). Unit of length There were various standard arpents. The most common were the arpent used in North America, which was defined as 180 French feet (', of approximately ), and the arpent used in Paris, which was defined as 220 French feet. * In North America, 1 arpent = 180 French feet = about 192 English feet = about 58.47 metres * In Paris, 1 arpent = 220 French feet = about 234 English feet = about 71.46 metres Unit of area Historically, in North America, 1 (square) arpent ('), also known as a French acre, was 180 French feet × 180 French feet = 32,400 French square feet = about 3419 square metres = about 0.845 English acres. Certain U.S. states have official definitions of the arpent which vary slightly: * In Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, the official conversion is 1 arpent = .In Louisiana, an arpent is equal to approximately 0.84628 acre; see Derouen v.

In Mauritius and Seychelles, an arpent is about 4220.87 square metres, 0.4221 hectares, 1.043 acres. Louisiana In Louisiana, parcels of land known as arpent sections or French arpent land grants also pre-date the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), but are treated as PLSS sections. An arpent is a French measurement of approximately , and a square arpent (also referred to as an arpent) is about . French arpent land divisions are long narrow parcels of land, also called ribbon farms, usually found along the navigable streams of southern Louisiana, and also found along major waterways in other areas. This system of land subdivision was begun by French settlers in the 18th century, according to typical French practice at the time and was continued by both the Spanish and by the American government after the acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase. A typical French arpent land division is 2 to 4 arpents wide along the river by 40 to 60 arpents deep, while the Spanish arpent land divisions tend to be 6 to 8 arpents wide by 40 arpents deep. This method of land division provided each land-owner with river frontage as well as land suitable for cultivation and habitation. These areas are given numbers just like standard sections, although the section numbers frequently exceed the normal upper limit of 36.The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) See also *Acre *Morgen * Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution * Voltaire famously dismissed Canada as Quelques arpents de neige, \\"a few acres of snow\\". * Weights and Measures Act (Canada) References Category:Units of area Category:Units of length Category:Area Category:Surveying hu:Hold (mértékegység) ro:Iugăr ","title":"Arpent"},{"id":"2008212","text":"Fleabee's Fortune is the first book in the Deptford Mouselets Series by Robin Jarvis (first published in 2004).

Members of the original meson \\"octet\\" are shown in green, the singlet in magenta. Although these mesons are now grouped into a nonet, the Eightfold Way name derives from the patterns of eight for the mesons and baryons in the original classification scheme. In particle physics, the quark model is a classification scheme for hadrons in terms of their valence quarks—the quarks and antiquarks which give rise to the quantum numbers of the hadrons. The quark model underlies \\"flavor SU(3)\\", or the Eightfold Way, the successful classification scheme organizing the large number of lighter hadrons that were being discovered starting in the 1950s and continuing through the 1960s. It received experimental verification beginning in the late 1960s and is a valid effective classification of them to date. The model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann, who dubbed them \\"quarks\\" in a concise paper, and George Zweig, who suggested \\"aces\\" in a longer manuscript. André Petermann also touched upon the central ideas from 1963 to 1965, without as much quantitative substantiation. Today, the model has essentially been absorbed as a component of the established quantum field theory of strong and electroweak particle interactions, dubbed the Standard Model. Hadrons are not really \\"elementary\\", and can be regarded as bound states of their \\"valence quarks\\" and antiquarks, which give rise to the quantum numbers of the hadrons. These quantum numbers are labels identifying the hadrons, and are of two kinds. One set comes from the Poincaré symmetry—JPC, where J, P and C stand for the total angular momentum, P-symmetry, and C-symmetry, respectively. The remaining are flavor quantum numbers such as the isospin, strangeness, charm, and so on. The strong interactions binding the quarks together are insensitive to these quantum numbers, so variation of them leads to systematic mass and coupling relationships among the hadrons in the same flavor multiplet. All quarks are assigned a baryon number of ⅓. Up, charm and top quarks have an electric charge of +⅔, while the down, strange, and bottom quarks have an electric charge of −⅓. Antiquarks have the opposite quantum numbers. Quarks are spin-½ particles, and thus fermions. Each quark or antiquark obeys the Gell- Mann−Nishijima formula individually, so any additive assembly of them will as well. Mesons are made of a valence quark−antiquark pair (thus have a baryon number of 0), while baryons are made of three quarks (thus have a baryon number of 1). This article discusses the quark model for the up, down, and strange flavors of quark (which form an approximate flavor SU(3) symmetry). There are generalizations to larger number of flavors. History Developing classification schemes for hadrons became a timely question after new experimental techniques uncovered so many of them that it became clear that they could not all be elementary. These discoveries led Wolfgang Pauli to exclaim \\"Had I foreseen that, I would have gone into botany.\\" and Enrico Fermi to advise his student Leon Lederman: \\"Young man, if I could remember the names of these particles, I would have been a botanist.\\" These new schemes earned Nobel prizes for experimental particle physicists, including Luis Alvarez, who was at the forefront of many of these developments. Constructing hadrons as bound states of fewer constituents would thus organize the \\"zoo\\" at hand. Several early proposals, such as the ones by Enrico Fermi and Chen-Ning Yang (1949), and the Sakata model (1956), ended up satisfactorily covering the mesons, but failed with baryons, and so were unable to explain all the data. The Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula, developed by Murray Gell-Mann and Kazuhiko Nishijima, led to the Eightfold Way classification, invented by Gell-Mann, with important independent contributions from Yuval Ne'eman, in 1961. The hadrons were organized into SU(3) representation multiplets, octets and decuplets, of roughly the same mass, due to the strong interactions; and smaller mass differences linked to the flavor quantum numbers, invisible to the strong interactions. The Gell-Mann–Okubo mass formula systematized the quantification of these small mass differences among members of a hadronic multiplet, controlled by the explicit symmetry breaking of SU(3). The spin- baryon, a member of the ground-state decuplet, was a crucial prediction of that classification. After it was discovered in an experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Gell-Mann received a Nobel prize in physics for his work on the Eightfold Way, in 1969. Finally, in 1964, Gell-Mann, and, independently, George Zweig, discerned what the Eightfold Way picture encodes: They posited three elementary fermionic constituents – the “up”, “down”, and “strange” quarks – which are unobserved, and possibly unobservable in a free form. Simple pairwise or triplet combinations of these three constituents and their antiparticles underlie and elegantly encode the Eightfold Way classification, in an economical, tight structure, resulting in further simplicity. Hadronic mass differences were now linked to the different masses of the constituent quarks. It would take about a decade for the unexpected nature—and physical reality—of these quarks to be appreciated more fully (See Quarks). Counter-intuitively, they cannot ever be observed in isolation (color confinement), but instead always combine with other quarks to form full hadrons, which then furnish ample indirect information on the trapped quarks themselves. Conversely, the quarks serve in the definition of quantum chromodynamics, the fundamental theory fully describing the strong interactions; and the Eightfold Way is now understood to be a consequence of the flavor symmetry structure of the lightest three of them. Mesons Figure 2: Pseudoscalar mesons of spin 0 form a nonet Figure 3: Mesons of spin 1 form a nonet The Eightfold Way classification is named after the following fact: If we take three flavors of quarks, then the quarks lie in the fundamental representation, 3 (called the triplet) of flavor SU(3). The antiquarks lie in the complex conjugate representation . The nine states (nonet) made out of a pair can be decomposed into the trivial representation, 1 (called the singlet), and the adjoint representation, 8 (called the octet). The notation for this decomposition is :\\\\mathbf{3}\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{3}} = \\\\mathbf{8} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{1}. Figure 1 shows the application of this decomposition to the mesons. If the flavor symmetry were exact (as in the limit that only the strong interactions operate, but the electroweak interactions are notionally switched off), then all nine mesons would have the same mass. However, the physical content of the full theory includes consideration of the symmetry breaking induced by the quark mass differences, and considerations of mixing between various multiplets (such as the octet and the singlet). N.B. Nevertheless, the mass splitting between the and the is larger than the quark model can accommodate, and this \\"– puzzle\\" has its origin in topological peculiarities of the strong interaction vacuum, such as instanton configurations. Mesons are hadrons with zero baryon number. If the quark–antiquark pair are in an orbital angular momentum state, and have spin , then * L − S ≤ J ≤ L + S, where S = 0 or 1, * P = (−1)L + 1, where the 1 in the exponent arises from the intrinsic parity of the quark–antiquark pair. * C = (−1)L + S for mesons which have no flavor. Flavored mesons have indefinite value of C. * For isospin I = 1 and 0 states, one can define a new multiplicative quantum number called the G-parity such that . If P = (−1)J, then it follows that S = 1, thus PC= 1. States with these quantum numbers are called natural parity states; while all other quantum numbers are thus called exotic (for example the state ). Baryons Figure 4. The S = ground state baryon octet Figure 5. The S = baryon decuplet Since quarks are fermions, the spin–statistics theorem implies that the wavefunction of a baryon must be antisymmetric under exchange of any two quarks. This antisymmetric wavefunction is obtained by making it fully antisymmetric in color, discussed below, and symmetric in flavor, spin and space put together. With three flavors, the decomposition in flavor is :\\\\mathbf{3}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{3}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{3}=\\\\mathbf{10}_S\\\\oplus\\\\mathbf{8}_M\\\\oplus\\\\mathbf{8}_M\\\\oplus\\\\mathbf{1}_A. The decuplet is symmetric in flavor, the singlet antisymmetric and the two octets have mixed symmetry. The space and spin parts of the states are thereby fixed once the orbital angular momentum is given. It is sometimes useful to think of the basis states of quarks as the six states of three flavors and two spins per flavor. This approximate symmetry is called spin-flavor SU(6). In terms of this, the decomposition is ::\\\\mathbf{6}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{6}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{6}=\\\\mathbf{56}_S\\\\oplus\\\\mathbf{70}_M\\\\oplus\\\\mathbf{70}_M\\\\oplus\\\\mathbf{20}_A ~. The 56 states with symmetric combination of spin and flavour decompose under flavor SU(3) into ::\\\\mathbf{56}=\\\\mathbf{10}^\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\oplus\\\\mathbf{8}^\\\\frac{1}{2} ~, where the superscript denotes the spin, S, of the baryon. Since these states are symmetric in spin and flavor, they should also be symmetric in space—a condition that is easily satisfied by making the orbital angular momentum L = 0\\\\. These are the ground state baryons. The S = octet baryons are the two nucleons (, ), the three Sigmas (, , ), the two Xis (, ), and the Lambda (). The S = decuplet baryons are the four Deltas (, , , ), three Sigmas (, , ), two Xis (, ), and the Omega (). For example, the constituent quark model wavefunction for the proton is :p_\\\\uparrow\\\\rangle= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt {18}} [ 2 u_\\\\uparrow d_\\\\downarrow u_\\\\uparrow \\\\rangle + 2 u_\\\\uparrow u_\\\\uparrow d_\\\\downarrow \\\\rangle +2 d_\\\\downarrow u_\\\\uparrow u_\\\\uparrow \\\\rangle -  u_\\\\uparrow u_\\\\downarrow d_\\\\uparrow\\\\rangle - u_\\\\uparrow d_\\\\uparrow u_\\\\downarrow\\\\rangle - u_\\\\downarrow d_\\\\uparrow u_\\\\uparrow\\\\rangle - d_\\\\uparrow u_\\\\downarrow u_\\\\uparrow\\\\rangle - d_\\\\uparrow u_\\\\uparrow u_\\\\downarrow\\\\rangle - u_\\\\downarrow u_\\\\uparrow d_\\\\uparrow\\\\rangle ]. Mixing of baryons, mass splittings within and between multiplets, and magnetic moments are some of the other quantities that the model predicts successfully. =The discovery of color= Color quantum numbers are the characteristic charges of the strong force, and are completely uninvolved in electroweak interactions. They were discovered as a consequence of the quark model classification, when it was appreciated that the spin S = baryon, the , required three up quarks with parallel spins and vanishing orbital angular momentum. Therefore, it could not have an antisymmetric wave function, (required by the Pauli exclusion principle), unless there were a hidden quantum number. Oscar Greenberg noted this problem in 1964, suggesting that quarks should be para-fermions. Instead, six months later, Moo-Young Han and Yoichiro Nambu suggested the existence of three triplets of quarks to solve this problem, but flavor and color intertwined in that model: They did not commute. The modern concept of color completely commuting with all other charges and providing the strong force charge was articulated in 1973, by William Bardeen, Harald Fritzsch, and Murray Gell-Mann. States outside the quark model While the quark model is derivable from the theory of quantum chromodynamics, the structure of hadrons is more complicated than this model allows. The full quantum mechanical wave function of any hadron must include virtual quark pairs as well as virtual gluons, and allows for a variety of mixings. There may be hadrons which lie outside the quark model. Among these are the glueballs (which contain only valence gluons), hybrids (which contain valence quarks as well as gluons) and \\"exotic hadrons\\" (such as tetraquarks or pentaquarks).

The first book in The Deptford Mice trilogy and Jarvis's debut novel, it follows the story of Audrey Brown, a mouse girl who is looking for her missing father. Her search takes her into the sewers of Deptford where, with the help of her friends and family, she must face an army of evil rats and their living god, a mysterious being known as Jupiter. The book was first published in the United Kingdom by Macdonald & Company in 1989, and was a runner-up for that year's Smarties Book Prize.Text on the front cover of the 2000 Hodder Silver edition of The Dark Portal. In 2000, it was published by SeaStar Books in the United States and given the Booklist Editors' Choice designation.Encyclopedia.com  Contemporary Authors  Jarvis, Robin 1963- . Plot In the sewers of Deptford there lurks a dark presence that fills the tunnels with fear: Jupiter, a dark god known only by his evil glowing eyes seen behind a dark \\"portal\\" in the tunnel wall. The rats worship him and do his dark bidding. No one really knows who he is except for his lieutenant Morgan. The Deptford mice, who worship the Green Mouse who brings Spring, are aware of Jupiter's evil presence in the tunnels. One of the mice, Albert Brown, is pulled through a grate into the sewers by the dark enchantments that Jupiter has woven there. He meets a cheeky mouse from the city, Piccadilly, also lost inside the lair of the rats. When Albert is captured by Morgan, a Cornish, piebald rat with a stump for a tail and rings through his ears (none other than Jupiter's lieutenant) and brought to Jupiter, Piccadilly escapes into Albert's home, known as the Skirtings, where he meets a large number of friends. Firstly, there is Audrey Brown, Albert's day-dreaming daughter who hates Piccadilly for surviving where her father did not. Then there is Arthur Brown, Audrey's plump and funny brother. There is also simple field mouse William Scuttle or 'Twit' and his cousin, the sickly albino runt, Oswald Chitter. Along with the old Midship-mouse Thomas Triton and Gwen Brown, the mother of Audrey and Arthur, they venture into the sewers to banish Jupiter from the world. The Rat God, however, has an evil plan to unleash the Black Death on the world once more, ridding it of humans and enabling him to conquer it. After a tense-confrontation with Jupiter in this throne-room, during which the malevolent deity is revealed to be a monstrous cat, Audrey defeats the Dark Lord by flinging her mousebrass at him. The talisman explodes and Jupiter falls into the water, which is rapidly flooding his chamber. The spirits of the many mice and rats he has tortured and devoured then rise up and drag the dark god down to a watery grave. Audrey glimpses her father among the legion of spirits as they depart and despairs, realizing that he is truly dead. The sewer floods and the Black Death is destroyed. Thankful that they are alive, and resolving to celebrate Jupiter's downfall once they return home, the mice begin the journey back to the surface- but as they leave, Orfeo the bat foretells doom. Main characters *Audrey Brown is a spunky, intelligent mouse girl with a sharp tongue that often gets her into trouble. She loves to daydream and enjoys dressing up in lacy outfits and wearing ribbons in her hair. When her father goes missing, she refuses to believe he is dead and sets out to find him. *Arthur Brown is the brother of Audrey, a plump, jolly mouse who often becomes irritated by his sister's saucy attitude and tendency to seemingly dream up wild, fantastic stories. Jarvis has indicated that he based the character of Arthur on himself. *Piccadilly is a cheeky and independent young grey mouse from the city who speaks with a Cockney accent. He is an orphan whose parents were killed by an underground train. While on a foraging expedition, he becomes lost in the sewers where he encounters Albert Brown. When the two stumble upon the altar chamber of Jupiter, Albert is captured while Piccadilly barely escapes with his life. He eventually meets up with Audrey, who blames him for abandoning her father. *William 'Twit' Scuttle is a kindhearted country mouse who is the cousin of Oswald Chitter. Because he is the result of a forbidden union between a house mouse and a field mouse, he is viewed by most as a simpleton with \\"no cheese upstairs\\". *Oswald Chitter is a frail albino mouse whose mother fusses over him. Because of how tall and awkward he is, to his chagrin he is sometimes mistaken for a rat. He has the ability to find lost objects with a divining rod. *Thomas Triton is a retired midshipmouse who makes his home aboard the Cutty Sark. He befriends Twit when the latter is unexpectedly dropped onto the ship by the bats Orfeo and Eldritch. *Jupiter is a mysterious evil being worshipped as a living god by the rats in the sewers of Deptford. He lives in a shadowy portal and no one has ever seen any more of him than his blazing red eyes. *Morgan is a cruel piebald Cornish rat who serves as Jupiter's loyal lieutenant. *Madame Akkikuyu is a black rat from Morocco who travels around posing as a fortune teller. Though she lacks true magical powers, she has always longed to possess them. *Orfeo and Eldritch are bat brothers who can see into the future. The problem is that they intentionally make their visions as vague as possible so no one can interpret them until the events actually happen. *Albert Brown is the father of Audrey and Arthur. A strange force compels him to enter the sewers where he meets a horrible end at the claws of Jupiter. His disappearance sets the story in motion. *The Green Mouse is the benevolent deity worshipped by the mice. A rodent version of the mythical Green Man, he is the essence of nature and all growing things. His power is strongest in the spring and dies completely in the winter. Development Jarvis came up with the idea for The Deptford Mice trilogy while working as a model-maker for television programmes and commercials. He had been designing a big, furry alien but decided to take a break and draw something small. That something was a mouse who would become the character Oswald Chitter. Jarvis continued to doodle mice, and when a friend of his saw the sketches, he suggested they be sent to a publisher. The publisher responded positively and asked if there was a story to accompany the drawings. At the time there wasn't one, but Jarvis then wrote the story of The Deptford Mice. He had originally envisioned it as a picture book, but it became a 70,000 word manuscript. When Jarvis' editor told him that the manuscript could make a trilogy due to its long length, he went away and cut it, and then came up with more ideas for the second and third books. Reception The Dark Portal has been praised as \\"a tale of horror and valor, good and evil, leavened with humor.\\" A starred review from Publisher's Weekly called the book a \\"spooky and enthralling animal fantasy just right for Redwall fans\\" and added that Jarvis \\"provides counterpoint to the heart-racing adventure with scenes of haunting beauty, including Audrey's mystical encounter with the Green Mouse and the country mouse Twit's nocturnal flight over London. The author conveys a sense of place powerful enough to elevate the South London boroughs of Greenwich and Blackheath to requisite stops on any bookish child's literary tour of the British capital.\\" Deirdre B. Root of Kliatt found The Dark Portal to be \\"entertaining and genuinely frightening.\\" Peter Glassman, owner of the New York City children's bookstore Books of Wonder, obtained a copy of The Dark Portal while on a trip to London. He greatly enjoyed it and would now and then come across others who had as well. The author of The Outsiders, S. E. Hinton, once told Glassman that The Deptford Mice novels became her son's favorites after finding them in Britain, but she could not understand why they were not yet available in the United States. Glassman would eventually obtain the rights for his company, SeaStar Books, to publish the trilogy and make it more readily available to American readers.

The film examines the political and diplomatic relationship between the Vatican and Nazi Germany during World War II. It is based upon the play, \\"Der Stellvertreter\\" by Rolf Hochhuth.  Plot  During World War II, Kurt Gerstein (Ulrich Tukur), a Waffen-SS officer employed in the SS Hygiene Institute, designs programs for the purification of water and the destruction of vermin. He is shocked to learn that the process he has developed to eradicate typhus, by using a hydrogen cyanide mixture called Zyklon B, is now being used for killing Jews and other \\"undesirables\\" in extermination camps. Gerstein attempts to notify Pope Pius XII (Marcel Iureş) about the gassings, but is appalled by the lack of response he gets from the Catholic hierarchy. The only person moved is Riccardo Fontana (Mathieu Kassovitz), a young Jesuit priest. Fontana and Gerstein attempt to raise awareness about what is happening to the Jews in Europe but even after Fontana appealing to the pope himself, the Vatican makes only a timid and vague condemnation of Hitler and Nazi Germany. Eventually Gerstein travels to Rome to speak to the Pope himself but when he arrives the Germans are taking control of Rome and begin rounding up the Italian Jews to be sent to concentration camps. Fontana begs the Pope to force the Germans to stop the deportation by appearing at the train station in person but the Pope refuses, saying that doing so will cause hardship for the Christians living under Nazi Germany. In disgust and sorrow Fontana puts a Yellow badge on himself and allows himself to be taken on the train of Jews going to the concentration camps. When he arrives at the camp Fontana is interrogated by the head of the camp, a 'friend' of Kurt Gerstein known simply as the Doctor (who is believed to be Dr. Josef Mengele), who despite knowing that the war is lost and that Fontana is a Catholic priest allows Fontana to stay with the Jews and be gassed. Gerstein attempts to save Fontana but he will not leave. The Doctor escorts Gerstein out of the camp after Fontana and most of the Jews are killed; they drive by German soldiers digging up and burning the bodies of Jews in a mass grave near the camp and the Doctor asks Gerstein if he knows any contacts to help get him out of Germany. Gerstein returns home and gathers all his evidence that documents the Nazi atrocities and takes them to the Allies. Despite accepting his evidence he is still arrested and after reading the charges against him he is found hanged in his cell. Afterward the Doctor is seen speaking to a Cardinal in Rome asking for help leaving the country saying \\"I'm a doctor, just a physician\\" and the cardinal agrees to help send him to Argentina. While the character of Kurt Gerstein is historical, the character of the young priest is fictional. Although based on the action of Gerstein to stop and bring global awareness to the Holocaust, the plot is largely fictitious.

Baldessari and his elder sister were raised in Southern California.Michael Small (October 12, 1990), John Baldessari Rises from His Artistic Ashes and Finds That He's Hot People. He attended Sweetwater High School and San Diego State College. Between 1960 and 1984, he was married to Montessorian teacher Carol Ann Wixom; they had two children. In 1959, Baldessari began teaching art in the San Diego school system. He taught for nearly three decades, in schools and junior colleges and community colleges, and eventually at the university level. When the University of California decided to open up a campus in San Diego, the new head of the Visual Art Department, Paul Brach, asked Baldessari to be part of the originating faculty in 1968. At UCSD he shared an office with David Antin.Karen Wright (October 23, 2009), John Baldessari Art in America. In 1970, Baldessari moved to Santa Monica, where he met many artists and writers, and began teaching at CalArts. His first classes included David Salle, Jack Goldstein, Mike Kelley, Ken Feingold, Tony Oursler, James Welling, Barbara Bloom, Matt Mullican, and Troy Brauntuch.Calvin Tomkins (October 18, 2010), No More Boring Art: John Baldessari’s crusade The New Yorker.Jori Finkel (June 20, 2010), John Baldessari's former students share memories Los Angeles Times. While at CalArts, Baldessari taught \\"the infamous Post Studio class\\", which he intended to \\"indicate people not daubing away at canvases or chipping away at stone, that there might be some other kind of class situation.\\"Knight, Christopher. A Situation Where Art Might Happen: John Baldessari on CalArts East of Borneo. November 19, 2011. The class, which operated outside of medium-specificity, was influential in informing the context for addressing a student's art practice at CalArts, and established a tradition of conceptual critique at CalArts that was carried on by artists such as Michael Asher. He quit teaching at CalArts in 1986, moving on to teach at UCLA, which he continued until 2008. At UCLA, his students included Elliott Hundley and Analia Saban. Work and themesEarly text paintings= By 1966, Baldessari was using photographs and text, or simply text, on canvas. His early major works were canvas paintings that were empty but for painted statements derived from contemporary art theory. An early attempt of Baldessari's included the hand-painted phrase \\"Suppose it is true after all? WHAT THEN?\\" (1967) on a heavily worked painted surface. However, this proved personally disappointing because the form and method conflicted with the objective use of language that he preferred to employ. Baldessari decided the solution was to remove his own hand from the construction of the image and to employ a commercial, lifeless style so that the text would impact the viewer without distractions. The words were then physically lettered by sign painters, in an unornamented black font. The first of this series presented the ironic statement \\"A TWO-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE WITHOUT ANY ARTICULATION IS A DEAD EXPERIENCE\\" (1967). Another work, Painting for Kubler (1967–68) presented the viewer theoretical instructions on how to view it and on the importance of context and continuity with previous works. This work referenced art historian George Kubler's seminal book, The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things. The seemingly legitimate art concerns were intended by Baldessari to become hollow and ridiculous when presented in such a purely self-referential manner. =Disowning of early work= In 1970, Baldessari and five friends burnt all of the paintings he had created between 1953 and 1966 as part of a new piece, titled The Cremation Project. The ashes from these paintings were baked into cookiesPaul Levy (September 30, 2011), For Baldessari, Art Imitates Art The Wall Street Journal. and placed into an urn, and the resulting art installation consists of a bronze commemorative plaque with the destroyed paintings' birth and death dates, as well as the recipe for making the cookies.Grant, Daniel. \\"Can Artists Really Disown their Early Work?\\" The Huffington Post. August 11, 2010. Through the ritual of cremation Baldessari draws a connection between artistic practice and the human life cycle. Thus the act of disavowal becomes generative as with the work of auto-destructive artist Jean Tinguely. =Juxtaposing text with images= Baldessari is best known for works that blend photographic materials (such as film stills), take them out of their original context and rearrange their form, often including the addition of words or sentences. Related to his early text paintings were his Wrong series (1966–1968), which paired photographic images with lines of text from an amateur photography book, aiming at the violation of a set of basic \\"rules\\" on snapshot composition.Interview with Moira Roth In one of the works, Baldessari had himself photographed in front of a palm precisely so that it would appear that the tree were growing out of his head.John Baldessari, Wrong (1966-1968) LACMA, Los Angeles. His photographic California Map Project (1969) created physical forms that resembled the letters in \\"California\\" geographically near to the very spots on the map that they were printed. In the Binary Code Series, Baldessari used images as information holders by alternating photographs to stand in for the on-off state of binary code; one example alternated photos of a woman holding a cigarette parallel to her mouth and then dropping it away. Another of Baldessari's series juxtaposed an image of an object such as a glass, or a block of wood, and the phrase \\"A glass is a glass\\" or \\"Wood is wood\\" combined with \\"but a cigar is a good smoke\\" and the image of the artist smoking a cigar. These directly refer to René Magritte's The Treachery of Images; the images similarly were used to stand in for the objects described. However, the series also apparently refers to Sigmund Freud's famous attributed observation that \\"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar\\",attributed in Bartlett, Familiar Quotations, 15th Ed. as well as to Rudyard Kipling's \\"… a woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke.\\"\\"The Betrothed,\\" Departmental Ditties and Barrack Room Ballads, Ed. Project Gutenberg In \\"Double Bill\\", a 2012 series of large inkjet prints,John Baldessari: Double Bill, April 6 - May 12, 2012 Marian Goodman Gallery, Paris. Baldessari paired the work of two selected artists (such as Giovanni di Paolo with David Hockney, or Fernand Léger with Max Ernst) on a single canvas, further altering the appropriated picture plane by overlaying his own hand- painted color additions. Baldessari then names only one of his two artistic \\"collaborators\\" on each canvas's lower edge, such as …AND MANET or …AND DUCHAMP.John Baldessari: Double Bill (Part 2), May 12 - June 30, 2012 Margo Leavin Gallery, Los Angeles.David Pagel (May 18, 2012), Review: 'John Baldessari' is joyously more than sum of its sources Los Angeles Times. =Arbitrary games= Baldessari has expressed that his interest in language comes from its similarities in structure to games, as both operate by an arbitrary and mandatory system of rules. In this spirit, many of his works are sequences showing attempts at accomplishing an arbitrary goal, such as Throwing Three Balls in the Air to Get a Straight Line (1973), in which the artist attempted to do just that, photographing the results, and eventually selecting the \\"best out of 36 tries\\", with 36 being the determining number just because that is the standard number of shots on a roll of 35mm film. The writer eldritch Priest ties John Baldessari's piece Throwing four balls in the air to get a square (best of 36 tries) as an early example of post-conceptual art.eldritch Priest, Boring Formless Nonsense: Experimental Music and The Aesthetics of Failure, Bloomsbury Academic, 2013, p. 5 This work was published in 1973 by a young Italian publisher: Giampaolo Prearo that was one of the first to believe and invest in the work of Baldessari. He printed two series one in 2000 copies and a second more precious reserved to the publisher in 500 copies. Following Baldessari's seminal statement \\"I will not make any more boring Art\\", he conceived the work The Artist Hitting Various Objects with a Golf Club (1972–73), composed of 30 photographs of the artist swinging and hitting with a golf club objects excavated from a dump, as a parody of cataloging rather than a thorough straight classification.John Baldessari: Early Work, 28 February – 11 April 2015 Marian Goodman, Paris. =Pointing= Much of Baldessari's work involves pointing, in which he tells the viewer not only what to look at but how to make selections and comparisons, often simply for the sake of doing so. Baldessari's Commissioned Paintings (1969) series took the idea of pointing literally, after he read a criticism of conceptual art that claimed it was nothing more than pointing. Beginning with photos of a hand pointing at various objects, Baldessari then hired amateur yet technically adept artists to paint the pictures. He then added a caption \\"A painting by [painter's name]\\" to each finished painting. In this instance, he has been likened to a choreographer, directing the action while having no direct hand in it, and these paintings are typically read as questioning the idea of artistic authorship. The amateur artists have been analogized to sign painters in this series, chosen for their pedestrian methods that were indifferent to what was being painted.Harvey, Doug. \\"John Baldessari: Point Man\\". LA Weekly. August 5, 2010. Baldessari critiques formalist assessments of art in a segment from his video How We Do Art Now (1973), entitled \\"Examining Three 8d Nails\\", in which he gives obsessive attention to minute details of the nails, such as how much rust they have, or descriptive qualities such as which appears \\"cooler, more distant, less important\\" than the others. = Dots = Circular adhesive dots covering up the faces of photographed and painted portraits are a prevailing motif in Baldessari's work from the mid-1980s onward. The artist himself suspected that, despite the broad array of approaches he's taken over the course of his career, he will be best remembered as \\"the guy who puts dots over peoples faces.\\" Examples of the \\"dot portraits\\" would include—for example—Bloody Sunday (1987) or Stonehenge with Two Persons (2005), though these works are numerous and it is difficult to identify an exemplar. The dots in these paintings evoke brightly colored price-stickers sometimes seen at garage sales, thrift stores or placed on retail items during a sale. Indeed, these stickers appear to have been the inspiration for the method. Describing his initial intuitive leap in this direction, Baldessari said, \\"I just had these price stickers I was using for something else, in some graphic way and I put them on all the faces and I just felt like it leveled the playing field.\\" The dot-faced works may sometimes be described as paintings, collages, or may be released as print editions. =Prints= John Baldessari, Studio, 1988, Lithograph and silkscreen on Sommerset paper, 25 ¾ x 34 in, Los Angeles County Museum of Art Baldessari began making prints in the early 1970s and continued to produce editions. He created his first print – I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art (1971) - as an edition to raise funds for the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax. The lithograph was created in conjunction with the now renowned exhibition for which – at Baldessari's request – students endlessly wrote the phrase \\"I will not make any more boring art\\" on the gallery walls. The artist has since worked internationally with premier publishers including Arion Press of San Francisco, Brook Alexander Editions of New York, Cirrus Editions of Los Angeles, Crown Point Press of San Francisco, Edition Jacob Samuel of Santa Monica, Gemini G.E.L. of Los Angeles, Mixografia of Los Angeles, Multiples, Multi Editions of Los Angeles, Inc. of New York, and Peter Blum Editions of New York. His 1988 prints, The Fallen Easel and Object (with Flaw), represented a major shift in Baldessari's approach to presentation, allowing a more complex relationship between his found imagery. In both prints, Baldessari expertly contrasts unrelated photographs to suggest a mysterious and/or ominous undercurrent. In the 1990s Baldessari began working with Mixografia Workshop to create three-dimensional prints utilizing their unique process of printing from metal molds. Baldessari's interest in dimensionality has carried over to recent editions from Gemini G.E.L., including the Person with Guitar series (2005) and the print series Noses & Ears, Etc. (2006–2007) in which screen-printed images are constructed in three layers on sintra with hand painting. A 2007 publication from Gemini is God Nose, a cast aluminum piece that is designed to hang from the ceiling.John Baldessari: A Print Retrospective from the Collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and his Family Foundation, July 11–November 8, 2009 Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Baldessari also contributed to the 2008 Artists for Obama portfolio, a set of prints in a limited edition of 150 published by Gemini G.E.L.. =Performance and film= Originally conceived in 1970, Unrealised Proposal for Cadavre Piece would have visitors look through a peep-hole and see a dead male body laid out with its feet towards them inside a climate-controlled vitrine,Marina Cashdan (July 13, 2011), Live From Manchester New York Times Magazine. made to resemble Andrea Mantegna’s painting, The Lamentation over the Dead Christ (1480). Hans Ulrich Obrist, the co-director of London’s Serpentine Gallery and Klaus Biesenbach, the director of MoMA PS1, first attempted to realize Baldessari’s idea in 2011 and the resulting paperwork of failed attempts to procure a willing male cadaver was displayed in the exhibition \\"11 Rooms\\" at the Manchester International Festival.Elizabeth Fortescue (April 16, 2013), Art project using a human cadaver could still happen The Art Newspaper. Baldessari's film Police Drawing documents a 1971 performance, Police Drawing Project. In this piece, the artist walked into a class of art students who had never seen him, set up a video camera to document the proceedings, and left the room. Subsequently, a police artist entered and, based on the students' testimony, sketched a likeness of the artist.Police Drawing by John Baldessari, 1971 Electronic Arts Intermix, New York. In the black-and-white video I Am Making Art (1971), Baldessari stands facing the camera; for nearly 20 minutes, he strikes and then holds various poses — crossing his arms over his chest or swinging one arm out to one side or pointing directly at the lens, for example — and with each new gesture, he states \\"I am making art.\\" In a 1972 tribute to fellow artist Sol LeWitt, Baldessari sang lines from LeWitt's thirty-five statements on conceptual art to the tune of popular songs.John Baldessari sings Sol LeWitt San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Other films include Teaching a Plant the Alphabet and the Inventory videos, also from 1972. A riff on his 1977 color video Six Colourful Inside Jobs, in Thirteen Colorful Inside Jobs (2013) a room is repainted by a performer in a different colour every day for the duration of the exhibition, carefully following the instructions of the artist.John Baldessari, Six Colourful Inside Jobs (1977) Kaldor Public Art Projects. = Sculpture = Baldessari created his first ever sculpture, Beethoven's Trumpet (with Ear) Opus # 127, 130, 131, 132, 133, 135 (2007), a series of 6 resin, fiberglass, bronze, aluminum, and electronics components in the form of a gigantic bronze trumpet extending off an oversized ear sculpted on the wall. The sculpture was produced with Beyer Projects. When the viewer speaks into the trumpet, the sounds causes a short recital of a phrase from a Beethoven string quartet. Baldessari has gone on to create sculptural works that often incorporate resin, bronze, and steel, such as the approximately 2.4 m carrot (Fake Carrot, 2016) and an elongated bronze figure trapped wearing a wooden barrel in a nod to Giacometti (Giacometti Variation, 2018). Exhibitions Baldessari was in over 200 solo shows and 1,000 group shows in his six-decade career.Mary M. Lane (September 6, 2013), Photos, Scissors And Wry Humor The Wall Street Journal. He had his first gallery solo exhibition at the Molly Barnes Gallery in Los Angeles in 1968. His first retrospective exhibition in the U.S. in 1981 was mounted by the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, and traveled to the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, the CAM, Houston, the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, and the Museum Folkwang, Essen. His work has since been exhibited in: *Documenta V (1972) and VII (1982) *the Whitney Biennial (1983) *the Carnegie International (1985–86) *the 47th Venice Biennial (1997) Solo presentations of his work at museums have included exhibitions at: *the Albertina, Vienna (1999) *Sprengel Museum, Hannover (1999–2000) *Museo d'Arte Moderna Contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto, Trento (2000–2001) *Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien, the Kunsthaus Graz, and Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin (2004) *Museo Jumex, Mexico City (2017) Retrospectives of his work were shown at MOCA, Los Angeles, which traveled to SFMOMA, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Whitney Museum and the Musée d'Art Contemporain, Montreal in 1990-92; at Cornerhouse, Manchester, and traveled to London, Stuttgart, Ljubljana, Oslo, and Lisbon in 1995-96 entitled \\"This Not That\\"; and Pure Beauty opened at the Tate Modern, London, in 2009 and travelled to MACBA, Barcelona; LACMA, Los Angeles; and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, through 2011. There was an \\"Artist's Choice: John Baldessari\\" at the Museum of Modern Art in 1994, and the artist was invited to curate the exhibition \\"Ways of Seeing: John Baldessari Explores the Collection\\" at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 2006, and he created the exhibition design for \\"Magritte and Contemporary Art: The Treachery of Images\\" at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

He was the first African-American athlete to win a medal in the Olympic Games, winning two bronze medals at the 1904 games in St. Louis. BiographyEarly life= Born in Hannibal, Missouri, his family moved to La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1884. After his father, James, died in 1888, George Poage, along with his mother and surviving sibling, moved into the home of Mary and Lucian Easton; Lucian was the son of local lumberman Jason Easton, who employed James in his stables. At La Crosse High School Poage excelled as both a student and an athlete; he was considered the top athlete at the school and, in 1899, was the class salutatorian, becoming the school's first African- American graduate. =College and Olympic years= The following fall he became a freshman at the University of Wisconsin. After competing with the freshman track squad in 1900, he joined the varsity track and field team during his sophomore year. Poage was the first black athlete to run for UW, specializing in the short sprints and hurdles. A consistent point winner for his team, he quickly became well respected. When the track coach was called out of town in 1902, he placed Poage in charge of the team in his absence. Poage graduated in 1903 with a degree in History. His senior thesis was titled \\"An Investigation into the Economic Condition of the Negro in the State of Georgia During the Period of 1860–1900\\". He returned to the University for the 1903–04 school year to take graduate classes in History, supported by the UW athletic department, which hired him as an athletic trainer for the football team. In June 1904, he became the first African-American individual Big Ten track champion in conference history, placing first in both the 440-yard dash and the 220-yard hurdles. The Milwaukee Athletic Club sponsored Poage to compete in the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri. Many prominent African-American leaders had called for a boycott of the games to protest racial segregation of the events in St. Louis. An integrated audience was not allowed at either the Olympics or the World's Fair as the organizers had built segregated facilities for the spectators. Poage chose to compete in four events and became the first African-American to medal in the Games by winning the bronze in both the 200-yard and 400-yard hurdles. =Later years= Poage remained in St. Louis after the Olympics, working as a school principal for a year before becoming a teacher at segregated Charles Sumner High School. At Sumner, he was the head of the English department, teaching English composition, literature, and Latin, helped coach the school’s sports teams, and supervised various extracurricular activities such as debate and theater. In 1914, Poage left his job at Sumner. According to a former student, he purchased to a farm in Minnesota, although no land records of the purchase have been found. Local historian Margaret Lichter and Bruce Mouser have speculated that the land was owned by the Easton family. In 1920, Poage moved to Chicago. He worked in a restaurant for four years. In 1924, Poage was hired by the United States Postal Service and worked as a postal clerk for nearly thirty years. After his retirement in the 1950s he remained in Chicago until his death in 1962. Legacy Poage was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2013, the La Crosse City Council renamed Hood Park to George C. Poage Park in Poage's honor.

The group's label Drive-Thru Records had a distribution deal which allowed MCA Records to acquire their bands. After MCA Records was absorbed into Geffen Records in mid-2003, the band spent most of 2004 writing and demoing songs for their next album. Following pre-production in July 2004, the band began recording for Based on a True Story, finishing in September. The album was recorded at various studios in New York state and California. Separate sessions were produced by Tim O'Heir, Howard Benson and Eric Rachel. Prior to the album's release, \\"Bedroom Talk\\" was issued as a single in April 2005, and the band went on tour debuting a handful of songs from the album. Based on a True Story was released through Drive-Thru and Geffen Records on May 10. Peaking at number 18 on the Billboard 200, the album received mixed to positive reviews. Following its release, the band went on the Warped Tour throughout the summer. While on the tour, a music video was released for \\"Bedroom Talk\\". Soon after, Geffen de-prioritized the album, which resulted in the band leaving the label in December. Further tours in the UK and the US followed. Background The Starting Line formed in 1999, signing with independent label Drive-Thru Records shortly afterwards. The band's debut album Say It Like You Mean It, released in July 2002, was a joint release by Drive-Thru and major label MCA Records. MCA's distribution deal allowed it to acquire Drive-Thru Records' bands over a period of time.Billboard 1999, p. 74 By the time the group sold around 300,000 copies, the band was signed to MCA Records, who saw the group's potential. Vocalist Kenny Vasoli said they were content with the label, based on the label's success with contemporaries New Found Glory and Blink-182. Following the conclusion of a US tour with Sum 41 in April 2003, the band took a brief break before they started writing for their next album. Say It Like You Mean It lone single \\"The Best of Me\\" received attention from MTV2, and was to be released to radio while the group performed on the Warped Tour in the summer. However, MCA Records was absorbed by Universal Music Group (UMG) subsidiary Geffen Records in mid-2003, which resulted in its staff and roster being moved to Geffen. According to guitarist Matt Watts, \\"We ended up on Geffen, and it just seemed like no one there would assume responsibility for our band.\\" On meeting people from the label, the group were told they would be treated like a new act, which left them disappointed. In November, they finished writing and were aiming to record their next record in early 2004. Despite this earlier claim, the group said they had only finished writing in January 2004. They subsequently spent over half of the year writing new material and recording demos in Vasoli's basement. After the demos were unexpectedly leaked on the Internet, the band's fans thought it was their next album, but they were just \\"rough sketches\\" of what the band was going for. According to Watts, when the band played the demos for their label, the label responded by playing New Found Glory's Catalyst (2004). The label people said: \\"'These demos aren't this CD, you guys should sound like this.' And that's not us.\\" Composition According to Watts, Geffen Records wanted the band to write a Simple Plan-esque record that had a pop sensibility to it that the label could release to the radio. The label pushed the band to write singles, however, the group \\"fought to the death\\" to write the record they wanted rather than Say It Like You Mean It, Part 2. According to Vasoli, most of the themes on Based on a True Story stem from having the songs but being frustrated by having to wait to get into the studio to record them. He thought the band had \\"definitely got more comfortable\\" with the songwriting process. Vasoli claimed the band expanded their musicality with Based on a True Story. \\"Inspired by the $\\" came about when Vasoli attempted to write a song their record label would view as a hit. Fed up, he wrote \\"Inspired by the $\\", a song which satisfied his \\"musical needs more than theirs.\\" According to Vasoli \\"Bedroom Talk\\" was inspired by the knowledge he would lose his virginity to someone who would \\"love me for longer than that night\\". With this in mind, he wanted the song's lyrics to symbolize the \\"physical and passionate sides of love\\" while being honest. Vasoli viewed \\"Photography\\" as a typical love song that he wanted to tell \\"the actual feeling of love\\". Watts considered the song the band's \\"November Rain\\". Similar to \\"Inspired by the $\\", \\"Ready\\" was another song Vasoli felt went against what the label wanted him to do. They wanted the song to have a verse/chorus formula, which he refused to write. Recording Geffen Records attempted to force the group into a direction which they did not want to go in and wanted Neal Avron to produce the album, but the band was determined to do their \\"own thing\\" according to Watts. Pre-production began on July 6 and lasted for two weeks while the band worked on 15 songs. During pre-production, Watts felt for the first time that the band was making a record as opposed to a bundle of songs that they simply liked. On August 1, it was announced that the band was one week into recording. On the same day, drummer Tom Gryskiewicz' drum parts were completed. On September 22, following eight weeks of work, recording was finished. Watts called the process \\"great and really laid back\\". Tim O'Heir produced and engineered \\"Inspired by the $\\", \\"Surprise, Surprise\\", \\"Photography\\", \\"Autography\\", \\"Artistic License\\", \\"Stay Where I Can See You\\", \\"The B-List\\", \\"Ready\\", \\"Cut! Print It\\" and \\"The World. These tracks were recorded at Mission Studios in Brooklyn, New York. Watts said O'Heir gave the songs an \\"organic feel\\" where \\"it's not all computed and Pro Tools and stuff like that\\". Additional engineering was done by Oliver Strauss. Additional recording took place at redruM Studios. David \\"Garo\\" Yellin arranged the strings on \\"Photography\\", and performed cello on the track. David Gold, Amy Kimbal and Taguchi Hiroka played violins on the track. Benjy King played the Hammond B3 organ on \\"Photography\\" and \\"Cut! Print It\\". Max Bemis of Say Anything contributed backing vocals on \\"Ready\\". Watts said it was \\"an honor\\" to have Bemis sing on the track as the band were big fans of Say Anything. Vasoli said Geffen were not satisfied with how some songs sounded and wanted them to re-record the singles. The band then began working with Howard Benson. Benson produced a new version of \\"The World\\", and \\"Bedroom Talk\\", with recording taking place at Bay 7 Studios, Valley Village and Sparky Dark Studio in Calabasas, California. The tracks were recorded by Mike Plotnikoff, with additional engineering by Eric Miller. They were also edited using Pro-Tools by Paul DeCarli. Benson also played keyboards and provided programming on the tracks. Eric Rachel produced and engineered \\"Making Love to the Camera\\" recorded at Trax East in New York. Shawn Corrigan served as production assistant. Additional production was done by Vasoli. All the recordings were mixed by Chris Lord-Alge, with assistance from Dimtar Krnjaic, at Resonate Music in Burbank, California. Greg Calbi mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound in New York City. Release In February 2005, the band embarked on a major US tour with Days Away, JamisonParker and Further Seems Forever.Jayaprakash 2005, p. 17 In April, the group went on tour with Armor for Sleep, Mae, and Suicide Pack, and debuted several new songs: \\"Surprise, Surprise\\", \\"Bedroom Talk\\", \\"Ready\\", \\"Inspired by the $\\", and \\"Photography\\". Around this time, the band filmed a music video for \\"Bedroom Talk\\". On April 11, the album's track listing was revealed. The following day, \\"Bedroom Talk\\" was released as a single. On April 17, \\"Inspired by the $\\" was made available for streaming via the group's PureVolume account, followed by three more songs on April 22. Based on a True Story was released by Drive-Thru and Geffen Records on May 10. The Japanese edition of the album included \\"Nights and Weekends\\" as a bonus track. It was later released in Canada on May 24 and in the UK on August 15. Fans who ordered the album within a week of pre-orders being posted received an autographed booklet. Everyone who pre-ordered was entered in a contest to win a Fender Telecaster guitar, and a lesson from a band member. Two runners-up received an assortment of Nike clothing. To promote its release, the group did a few in-store performances, and appeared at the Y100 radio festival in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Between mid-June and mid-August, the group went on the 2005 edition of Warped Tour. On July 11, the music video for \\"Bedroom Talk\\", directed by Corey Petrick, was released. Shortly afterwards, Geffen Records de-prioritized the album and, as a result, despite the band's increasing popularity, provided very little promotion for the single. Vasoli said of the situation: \\"It was like to go from such a perfect high point and have momentum going so well, then have it slowed down so much by the label\\". In mid-September, the band toured the UK with the Early November and Anberlin. From late-September to late-November, the group went on the 2005 edition of the Nintendo Fusion Tour. On November 3, Alternative Press reported that the band had left Geffen Records and was in discussion with other labels. AbsolutePunk reported that record labels were having meetings with the band while it was on the Nintendo Fusion Tour. The band's departure from Geffen Records was made official in mid-December. According to Watts, the band talked with Geffen president Jordan Schur who understood their concerns and the reasons they wanted to leave the label. \\"He finally gave us the option to leave, and we did that.\\" Vasoli added that it was \\"probably like an hour[-long phone] call with them really hashing it out\\". Vasoli also said that to be released from their contract with Geffen, the band \\"forfeited rights to the recordings of Based On A True Story. We might run into trouble if we ever try to re-record that stuff\\". In January 2006, the band co-headlined a UK tour with MxPx, with support from the Matches and I Am the Avalanche. In February and March, the group headlined the Screaming Is for Babies tour, with support from Copeland, Gatsbys American Dream, and Cartel. In October 2008, the album was made available for streaming through the band's Myspace profile, and released on vinyl in 2013. Reception Nine days after its release, Based on a True Story had sold 41,686 copies, charting at number 18 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album received mixed to positive reviews from critics. AbsolutePunk founder Jason Tate wrote that the band's sound was \\"still catchy, the music still bouncy\\" with \\"plenty of guaranteed sing along choruses\\". He considered it an unexpected release: \\"I figured it would be good, I never expected it to be great. I'm glad I was wrong.\\" He concluded by calling it \\"uplifting and incredibly fun to listen to\\". AllMusic reviewer Johnny Loftus drew a comparison between the band's earlier release The Make Yourself at Home EP (2003) and Based on a True Story. He said the album incorporated acoustic instrumentation, placing focus on Vasoli's \\"edge-of-tears\\" vocals, as well as \\"favoring busy breaks that distract from actual rocking\\". With this album, Loftus noted that the band \\"matured into a more grandiose version\\" of New Found Glory. Kaj Roth of Melodic magazine mentioned how the group mixed emo and pop punk on Based on a True Story, comparing it to \\"having Armor For Sleep and Autopilot Off making a record together\\". Roth thought the album contained \\"some truly great stuff, a few ok songs and unfortunately 2-3 fillers,\\" suggesting the band should have made an EP instead of an album. Punknews.org reviewer Meg Reinecker noted how the group had used the preceding three years to mature \\"both vocally and instrumentally\\". David Wild of Rolling Stone wrote that the band \\"made their sad songs much less cheesy\\" on the album. He said the \\"fresh-faced punk ballads\\" were \\"way more palatable\\" compared to \\"most emo bloodletting, but it's still too depressive and not as songful as it ought to be\\". Wild concluded by noting the band knows \\"how to make sweetly wordy pop out of over-the-top romantic naivete\\". Track listing All songs written by the Starting Line.

Viking Press) The Public Burning, Robert Coover's third novel, was published in 1977. It is an account of the events leading to the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. An uncharacteristically human caricature of Richard Nixon serves as protagonist and narrator for the primary continuity. The novel satirizes the Cold War politics of Joseph McCarthy by portraying \\"The Phantom\\" as the embodiment of global Communism and everything that threatens the American way of life—a vague, terrifying, and omnipresent enemy. The ugly side of the American psyche this draws out is characterized by an incarnation of Uncle Sam who unleashes a torrent of interminable verbosity in a folksy, foul-mouthed style whenever he appears. The New York Times and Time Magazine figure centrally as symbols of institutional failure not only to question whether the truth was a victim in this hyperpoliticized trial but also whether the official narrative was in fact a bunch of political lies. Coover first experienced difficulty finding a publisher, and then when he found a publisher, getting it to actually publish the novel, due to legal concerns over the unflattering depiction of Richard Nixon, Pat Nixon, Roy Cohn, and others.At the time, Cohn had sued NBC over Tail Gunner Joe, and Nixon, in his interviews with David Frost, indicated that he did not sue Woodward and Bernstein because their accusations were part of politics, and they had left Pat out. Then having published the novel, once it became a bestseller, Viking immediately abandoned all support, and pulled in copies, without explanation. Coover's editor, Richard Seaver, speculated to Coover that Viking management believed success would attract lawsuits.A very condensed summary is provided by the Introduction in the Grove Press edition of the novel. Despite these difficulties, this novel has received a large amount of critical attention. It has been called \\"perhaps the most complete replenishment of the language since Whitman and (in a different way) Mark Twain ... no writer since Melville has dived so deeply and fearlessly into this collective American dream as Coover has in this novel\\".Evenson, Brian (2006).

Photo of asylum patient, circa 1850-58 Hugh Welch Diamond (1809 - June 21, 1886) was an early British psychiatrist and photographer who made a major contribution to the craft of psychiatric photography. Early life Diamond was educated at Norwich School and later studied medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1824.J. Tucker, ‘Diamond, Hugh Welch (1809–1886)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 2 Oct 2013 He set up in private medical practice in Soho, London, and then decided to specialise in psychiatry, being appointed to Springfield asylum, the first Surrey County Asylum. Diamond later moved to Brookwood Hospital, also in Surrey. Diamond was one of the founders of the Photographic Society, was later its Secretary and also became the editor of the Photographic Journal. Work Diamond was fascinated by the possible use of photography in the treatment of mental disorders; some of his many calotypes depicting the expressions of people suffering from mental disorders are particularly moving. These were used not only for record purposes, but also, he claimed in the treatment of patients - although there was little evidence of success. Perhaps it is for his attempts to popularize photography and to lessen its mystique that Diamond is best remembered. He wrote many articles and was a popular lecturer, and he also sought to encourage younger photographers. Among the latter was Henry Peach Robinson, who was later to refer to Diamond as a \\"father figure\\" of photography. Recognition for his encouragement and for his willingness to share his knowledge came in 1855, in the form of a testimonial amounting to £300 for services to photography; among those who subscribed were such people as Delamotte, Fenton and George Shadbolt. In 1867, the Photographic Society awarded its Medal in recognition of \\"his long and successful labours as one of the principal pioneers of the photographic art and of his continuing endeavours for its advancement.\\" The following year, at his own initiative, he relinquished any further salary as Secretary of the Society, and became its Hon.

V2G storage capabilities can enable EVs to store and discharge electricity generated from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, with output that fluctuates depending on weather and time of day. V2G can be used with gridable vehicles, that is, plug-in electric vehicles (BEV and PHEV), with grid capacity. Since at any given time 95 percent of cars are parked, the batteries in electric vehicles could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the electric distribution network and back. A 2015 report on potential earnings associated with V2G found that with proper regulatory support, vehicle owners could earn $454, $394, and $318 per year depending on whether their average daily drive was , respectively. Batteries have a finite number of charging cycles, as well as a shelf-life, therefore using vehicles as grid storage can impact battery longevity. Studies that cycle batteries two or more times per day have shown large decreases in capacity and greatly shortened life. However, battery capacity is a complex function of factors such as battery chemistry, charging and discharging rate, temperature, state of charge and age. Most studies with slower discharge rates show only a few percent of additional degradation while one study has suggested that using vehicles for grid storage could improve longevity. Sometimes the modulation of charging of a fleet of electric vehicles by an aggregator to offer services to the grid but without actual electrical flow from the vehicles to the grid is called unidirectional V2G, as opposed to the bidirectional V2G that is generally discussed in this article. ApplicationsPeak load leveling= The concept allows V2G vehicles to provide power to help balance loads by \\"valley filling\\"S. G. Liasi and M. A. Golkar, \\"Electric vehicles connection to microgrid effects on peak demand with and without demand response,\\" 2017 Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE), Tehran, 2017, pp. 1272-1277, . (charging at night when demand is low) and \\"peak shaving\\" (sending power back to the grid when demand is high, see duck curve). Peak load leveling can enable new ways for utilities to provide regulation services (keeping voltage and frequency stable) and provide spinning reserves (meet sudden demands for power). These services coupled with \\"smart-meters\\" would allow V2G vehicles to give power back to the grid and in return, receive monetary benefits based on how much power given back to the grid. In its current development, it has been proposed that such use of electric vehicles could buffer renewable power sources such as wind power for example, by storing excess energy produced during windy periods and providing it back to the grid during high load periods, thus effectively stabilizing the intermittency of wind power. Some see this application of vehicle-to-grid technology as an approach to help renewable energy become a base load electricity technology. It has been proposed that public utilities would not have to build as many natural gas or coal-fired power plants to meet peak demand or as an insurance policy against power outages. Since demand can be measured locally by a simple frequency measurement, dynamic load leveling can be provided as needed. Carbitrage, a portmanteau of 'car' and 'arbitrage', is sometimes used to refer to the minimum price of electricity at which a vehicle would discharge its battery. =Backup power= Modern electric vehicles can generally store in their batteries more than an average home's daily energy demand. Even without a PHEV's gas generation capabilities such a vehicle could be used for emergency power for several days (for example, lighting, home appliances, etc.). This would be an example of Vehicle-to-home transmission (V2H). As such they may be seen as a complementary technology for intermittent renewable power resources such as wind or solar electric. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCV) with tanks containing up to 5.6 kg of hydrogen can deliver more than 90 kWh of electricity.  Types of V2G Unidirectional V2G or V1G = Many of the grid-scale benefits of V2G can be accomplished with unidirectional V2G, also known as V1G or \\"smart charging\\". The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) defines V1G as \\"unidirectional managed charging services\\" and defines the four levels of Vehicle-Grid Interface (VGI), which encompasses all of the ways that EVs can provide grid services, as follows: # Unidirectional power flow (V1G) with one resource and unified actors # V1G with aggregated resources # V1G with fragmented actor objectives # Bidirectional power flow (V2G) V1G involves varying the time or rate at which an electric vehicle is charged in order to provide ancillary services to the grid, while V2G also includes reverse power flow. V1G includes applications such as timing vehicles to charge in the middle of the day to absorb excess solar generation, or varying the charge rate of electric vehicles to provide frequency response services or load balancing services. V1G may be the best option to begin integrating EVs as controllable loads onto the electric grid due to technical issues that currently exist with regards to the feasibility of V2G. V2G requires specialized hardware (especially bi- directional inverters), has fairly high losses and limited round-trip efficiency, and may contribute to EV battery degradation due to increased energy throughput. Additionally, revenues from V2G in an SCE pilot project were lower than the costs of administering the project, indicating that V2G still has a ways to go before being economically feasible. = Bidirectional local V2G (V2H , V2B, V2X) = Vehicle-to-home (V2H) or vehicle-to-building (V2B) or vehicle-to-everything (V2X) do not typically directly affect grid performance but creates a balance within the local environment. The electric vehicle is used as a residential back-up power supply during periods of power outage or for increasing self-consumption of energy produced on-site (demand charge avoidance). Unlike more mature V1G solutions, V2X has not yet reached market deployment, apart from Japan where commercial V2H solutions have been available since 2012 as back-up a solution in case of electricity black-out.A 5G V2X Ecosystem Providing Internet of Vehicles - MDPI = Bidirectional V2G = With V2G, the electric vehicles could be equipped to actually provide electricity to the grid. The utility or transmission system operator may be willing to purchase energy from customers during periods of peak demandS. G. Liasi and S. M. T. Bathaee, \\"Optimizing microgrid using demand response and electric vehicles connection to microgrid,\\" 2017 Smart Grid Conference (SGC), Tehran, 2017, pp. 1-7, ., or to use the EV battery capacity for providing ancillary servicesSaldaña, Gaizka, Jose Ignacio San Martin, Inmaculada Zamora, Francisco Javier Asensio, and Oier Oñederra. \\"Electric vehicle into the grid: Charging methodologies aimed at providing ancillary services considering battery degradation.\\" Energies 12, no. 12 (2019): 2443., such as balancing and frequency control, including primary frequency regulation and secondary reserve. Thus, V2G is in most applications deemed to have higher potential commercial value than V2B or V2H. Efficiency Most modern battery electric vehicles use lithium-ion cells that can achieve round-trip efficiency greater than 90%. The efficiency of the battery depends on factors like charge rate, charge state, battery state of health, and temperature. The majority of losses, however, are in system components other than the battery. Power electronics, such as inverters, typically dominate overall losses. A study found overall round-trip efficiency for V2G system in the range of 53% to 62%'. Another study reports an efficiency of about 70%. The overall efficiency however depends on several factors and can vary widely. Implementation by country A study conducted in 2012 by the Idaho National Laboratory revealed the following estimations and future plans for V2G in various countries. It is important to note that this is difficult to quantify because the technology is still in its nascent stage, and is therefore difficult to reliably predict adoption of the technology around the world. The following list is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to give an idea of the scope of development and progress in these areas around the world. =United States= PJM Interconnection has envisioned using US Postal Service trucks, school buses and garbage trucks that remain unused overnight for grid connection. This could generate millions of dollars because these companies aid in storing and stabilizing some of the national grid's energy. The United States was projected to have one million electric vehicles on the road between 2015 and 2019. Studies indicate that 160 new power plants will need to be built by 2020 to compensate for electric vehicles if integration with the grid does not move forward. In North America, at least two major school-bus manufacturers—Blue Bird and Lion—are working on proving the benefits of electrification and vehicle-to-grid technology. As school buses in the U.S. currently use $3.2B of diesel a year, their electrification can help stabilize the electrical grid, lessen the need for new power plants, and reduce kids’ exposure to cancer- causing exhaust. In 2017, at the University of California San Diego, V2G technology provider Nuvve launched a pilot program called INVENT, funded by the California Energy Commission, with the installation of 50 V2G bi- directional charging stations around the campus. The program expanded in 2018 to include a fleet of EVs for its free nighttime shuttle service, Triton Rides. In 2018, Nissan launched a pilot program under the Nissan Energy Share initiative in partnership with vehicle-to-grid systems company Fermata Energy seeking to use bi-directional charging technology to partially power Nissan North America's headquarters in Franklin, Tn. In 2020 Fermata Energy’s bidirectional electric vehicle charging system became the first to be certified to the North American safety standard, UL 9741, the Standard for Bidirectional Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging System Equipment. =Japan= In order to meet the 2030 target of 10 percent of Japan's energy being generated by renewable resources, a cost of $71.1 billion will be required for the upgrades of existing grid infrastructure. The Japanese charging infrastructure market is projected to grow from $118.6 million to $1.2 billion between 2015 and 2020. Starting in 2012, Nissan plans to bring to market a kit compatible with the LEAF EV that will be able to provide power back into a Japanese home. Currently, there is a prototype being tested in Japan. Average Japanese homes use 10 to 12 KWh/day, and with the LEAF's 24 KWh battery capacity, this kit could potentially provide up to two days of power. Production in additional markets will follow upon Nissan's ability to properly complete adaptations. In November 2018 in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture, Toyota Tsusho Corporation and Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc initiated charging and discharging demonstrations with storage batteries of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles using V2G technology. The demonstration examines how to excel the ability of V2G systems to balance demand and supply of electricity is and what impacts V2G has on the power grid. In addition to ordinary usage of EVs/PHVs such as by transportation, the group is producing new values of EVs/PHVs by providing V2G services even when EVs/PHVs are parked. Two bi-directional charging stations, connected to a V2G aggregation server managed by Nuvve Corporation, have been installed at a parking lot in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture to conduct the demonstration test. The group aims to assess the capacity of EVs/PHVs to balance out demand and supply of electrical power by charging EVs/PHVs and supplying electrical power to the grid from EVs/PHVs. =Denmark= Denmark is one of the world's largest wind-based power generators. Initially, Denmark's goal is to replace 10% of all vehicles with PEVs, with an ultimate goal of a complete replacement to follow. The Edison Project implements a new set of goals that will allow enough turbines to be built to accommodate 50% of total power while using V2G to prevent negative impacts to the grid. Because of the unpredictability of wind, the Edison Project plans to use PEVs while they are plugged into the grid to store additional wind energy that the grid cannot handle. Then, during peak energy use hours, or when the wind is calm, the power stored in these PEVs will be fed back into the grid. To aid in the acceptance of EVs, policies have been enforced that create a tax differential between zero emission cars and traditional automobiles. The Danish PEV market value is expected to grow from $50 to $380 million between 2015 and 2020. PEV developmental progress and advancements pertaining to the use of renewable energy resources will make Denmark a market leader with respect to V2G innovation (ZigBee 2010). Following the Edison project, the Nikola project was started which focused on demonstrating the V2G technology in a lab setting, located at the Risø Campus (DTU). DTU is a partner along with Nuvve and Nissan. The Nikola project completed in 2016, laying the groundwork for Parker, which uses a fleet of EVs to demonstrate the technology in a real-life setting. This project is partnered by DTU, Insero, Nuvve, Nissan and Frederiksberg Forsyning (Danish DSO in Copenhagen). Besides demonstrating the technology the project also aims to clear the path for V2G-integration with other OEMs as well as calculating the business case for several types of V2G, such as Adaptive charging, overload protection, peak shaving, emergency backup and frequency balancing. In the project the partners explored the most viable commercial opportunities by systematically testing and demonstrating V2G services across car brands. Here, economic and regulatory barriers were identified as well as the economic and technical impacts of the applications on the power system and markets. The project started in August 2016 and ended in September 2018. =United Kingdom= The V2G market in the UK will be stimulated by aggressive smart grid and PEV rollouts. Starting in January 2011, programs and strategies to assist in PEV have been implemented. The UK has begun devising strategies to increase the speed of adoption of EVs. This includes providing universal high- speed internet for use with smart grid meters, because most V2G-capable PEVs will not coordinate with the larger grid without it. The \\"Electric Delivery Plan for London\\" states that by 2015, there will be 500 on-road charging stations; 2,000 stations off-road in car parks; and 22,000 privately owned stations installed. Local grid substations will need to be upgraded for drivers who cannot park on their own property. By 2020 in the UK, every residential home will have been offered a smart meter, and about 1.7 million PEVs should be on the road. The UK's electric vehicle market value is projected to grow from $0.1 to $1.3 billion between 2015 and 2020 (ZigBee 2010). In 2018, EDF Energy announced a partnership with a leading green technology company, Nuvve, to install up to 1,500 Vehicle to Grid (V2G) chargers in the UK. The chargers will be offered to EDF Energy’s business customers and will be used at its own sites to provide up to 15 MW of additional energy storage capacity. That’s the equivalent amount of energy required to power 4,000 homes. The stored electricity will be made available for sale on the energy markets or for supporting grid flexibility at times of peak energy use. EDF Energy is the largest electricity supplier to UK businesses and its partnership with Nuvve could see the largest deployment of V2G chargers so far in this country. In fall 2019, a consortium called Vehicle to Grid Britain (V2GB) released a research report on the potential of V2G technologies. Research Edison = Denmark's Edison project, an abbreviation for 'Electric vehicles in a Distributed and Integrated market using Sustainable energy and Open Networks' was a partially state funded research project on the island of Bornholm in Eastern Denmark. The consortium of IBM, Siemens the hardware and software developer EURISCO, Denmark's largest energy company Ørsted (formerly DONG Energy), the regional energy company Østkraft, the Technical University of Denmark and the Danish Energy Association, explored how to balance the unpredictable electricity loads generated by Denmark's many wind farms, currently generating approximately 20 percent of the country's total electricity production, by using electric vehicles (EV) and their accumulators. The aim of the project is to develop infrastructure that enables EVs to intelligently communicate with the grid to determine when charging, and ultimately discharging, can take place. At least one rebuild V2G capable Toyota Scion will be used in the project. The project is key in Denmark's ambitions to expand its wind-power generation to 50% by 2020. According to a source of British newspaper The Guardian 'It's never been tried at this scale' previously. The project concluded in 2013. =Southwest Research Institute= In 2014, Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) developed the first vehicle-to-grid aggregation system qualified by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The system allows for owners of electric delivery truck fleets to make money by assisting in managing the grid frequency. When the electric grid frequency drops below 60 Hertz, the system suspends vehicle charging which removes the load on the grid thus allowing the frequency to rise to a normal level. The system is the first of its kind because it operates autonomously. The system was originally developed as part of the Smart Power Infrastructure Demonstration for Energy Reliability and Security (SPIDERS) Phase II program, led by Burns and McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. The goals of the SPIDERS program are to increase energy security in the event of power loss from a physical or cyber disruption, provide emergency power, and manage the grid more efficiently. In November 2012, SwRI was awarded a $7 million contract from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to demonstrate the integration of vehicle-to-grid technologies as a source for emergency power at Fort Carson, Colorado. In 2013, SwRI researchers tested five DC fast-charge stations at the army post. The system passed integration and acceptance testing in August 2013. = Delft University of Technology= Prof. Dr. Ad van Wijk, Vincent Oldenbroek and Dr. Carla Robledo, researchers at Delft University of Technology, in 2016 conducted research on V2G technology with hydrogen FCEVs. Both experimental work with V2G FCEVs and techno-economic scenario studies for 100% renewable integrated energy and transport systems are done, using only hydrogen and electricity as energy carriers. They modified a Hyundai ix35 FCEV together with Hyundai R&D; so it can deliver up to 10 kW DC Power while maintaining road access permit. They developed together with the company Accenda b.v. a V2G unit converting the DC power of the FCEV into 3-phase AC power and injecting it into the Dutch national electricity grid. The Future Energy Systems Group also recently did tests with their V2G FCEVs whether it could offer frequency reserves. Based on the positive outcome of the tests an MSc thesis was published looking into the technical and economic feasibility assessment of a hydrogen and FCEV based Car Park as Power Plant offering frequency reserves. =University of Delaware= Willett Kempton, Suresh Advani, and Ajay Prasad are the researchers at the University of Delaware who are currently conducting research on the V2G technology, with Dr. Kempton being the lead on the project. Dr. Kempton has published a number of articles on the technology and the concept, many of which can be found on the V2G project page. The group is involved in researching the technology itself, as well as its performance when used on the grid. In addition to the technical research, the team has worked with Dr. Meryl Gardner, a marketing professor in the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economic at the University of Delaware, to develop marketing strategies for both consumer and corporate fleet adoption. A 2006 Toyota Scion xB car was modified for testing in 2007. In 2010, Kempton and Gregory Poilasne co-founded Nuvve, a V2G solutions company. The company has formed a number of industry partnerships and implemented V2G pilot projects on five continents worldwide. =Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory= At Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Dr. Samveg Saxena currently serves as the project lead for Vehicle-to-Grid Simulator (V2G-Sim). V2G-Sim is a simulation platform tool used to model spatial and temporal driving and charging behavior of individual plug-in electric vehicles on the electric grid. Its models are used to investigate the challenges and opportunities of V2G services, such as modulation of charging time and charging rate for peak demand response and utility frequency regulation. V2G-Sim has also been used to research the potential of plug-in electric vehicles for renewable energy integration. Preliminary findings using V2G-Sim have shown controlled V2G service can provide peak-shaving and valley-filling services to balance daily electric load and mitigate the duck curve. On the contrary, uncontrolled vehicle charging was shown to exacerbate the duck curve. The study also found that even at 20 percent fade in capacity, EV batteries still met the needs of 85 percent of drivers. In another research initiative at Lawrence Berkeley Lab using V2G-Sim, V2G services were shown to have minor battery degradation impacts on electric vehicles as compared to cycling losses and calendar aging. In this study, three electric vehicles with different daily driving itineraries were modelled over a ten-year time horizon, with and without V2G services. Assuming daily V2G service from 7PM to 9PM at a charging rate of 1.440 kW, the capacity losses of the electric vehicles due to V2G over ten years were 2.68%, 2.66%, and 2.62%. =Nissan and Enel= In May 2016, Nissan and Enel power company announced a collaborative V2G trial project in the United Kingdom, the first of its kind in the country. The trial comprises 100 V2G charging units to be used by Nissan Leaf and e-NV200 electric van users. The project claims electric vehicle owners will be able to sell stored energy back to the grid at a profit. One notable V2G project in the United States is at the University of Delaware, where a V2G team headed by Dr. Willett Kempton has been conducting on-going research. An early operational implementation in Europe was conducted via the German government-funded MeRegioMobil project at the \\"KIT Smart Energy Home\\" of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in cooperation with Opel as vehicle partner and utility EnBW providing grid expertise. Their goals are to educate the public about the environmental and economic benefits of V2G and enhance the product market. Other investigators are the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Xcel Energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and, in the United Kingdom, the University of Warwick. =University of Warwick= WMG and Jaguar Land Rover collaborated with the Energy and Electrical Systems group of the university. Dr Kotub Uddin analysed lithium ion batteries from commercially available EVs over a two year period. He created a model of battery degradation and discovered that some patterns of vehicle-to-grid storage were able to significantly increase the longevity of the vehicle's battery over conventional charging strategies, while permitting them to be driven in normal ways. Skepticism There is some skepticism among experts about the feasibility of V2G and several studies have questioned the concept's economic rationale. For example, a 2015 study found that economic analyses favorable to V2G fail to include many of the less obvious costs associated with its implementation. When these less obvious costs are included, the study finds that V2G represents an economically inefficient solution. The more a battery is used the sooner it needs replacing. Replacement cost is approximately 1/3 the cost of the electric car. Over their lifespan, batteries degrade progressively with reduced capacity, cycle life, and safety due to chemical changes to the electrodes. Capacity loss/fade is expressed as a percentage of initial capacity after a number of cycles (e.g., 30% loss after 1,000 cycles). Cycling loss is due to usage and depends on both the maximum state of charge and the depth of discharge. JB Straubel, CTO of Tesla Inc., discounts V2G because battery wear outweighs economic benefit. He also prefers recycling over re-use for grid once batteries have reached the end of their useful car life. A 2017 study found decreasing capacity, and a 2012 hybrid-EV study found minor benefit. Another common criticism is related to the overall efficiency of the process. Charging a battery system and returning that energy from the battery to the grid, which includes \\"inverting\\" the DC power back to AC inevitably incurs some losses. This needs to be factored against potential cost savings, along with increased emissions if the original source of power is fossil based. This cycle of energy efficiency may be compared with the 70–80% efficiency of large-scale pumped-storage hydroelectricity, which is however limited by geography, water resources and environment. Additionally, in order for V2G to work, it must be on a large scale basis. Power companies must be willing to adopt the technology in order to allow vehicles to give power back to the power grid. With vehicles giving power back to the grid, the aforementioned \\"smart-meters\\" would have to be in place in order to measure the amount of power being transferred to the grid.  Vehicles  There are several electric vehicles that have been specially modified or are designed to be compatible with V2G. Hyundai ix35 FCEV from Delft University of Technology is modified with a 10 kW DC V2G output. Two vehicles that have a theoretical V2G capability include the Nissan Leaf and Nissan e-NV200.

It has now been incorporated into the town, although it is still often referred to as a village by some locals. The Walsworth festival is held annually on Walsworth Common. Hitchin Walsworth is one of five wards for the purposes of electing councillors to North Hertfordshire District Council. The ward includes the Purwell neighbourhood, south of Walsworth, which is named after the River Purwell. Walsworth has a primary school – Highover Primary School – and a community centre. Another primary school, Purwell JMI, is within the ward, in the Purwell neighbourhood. Walsworth also has two pubs: The Millstream (formerly known as the Ship) on Cambridge Road next to the River Purwell, and the Anchor also on Cambridge Road, about 100 m to the East of the Millstream. Both pubs have been renovated in recent years. A third pub, The Sailor (formerly the Sailor Boy) on Woolgrove Road, opposite a playing field (Walsworth Common) was closed in 2013. On the 29th May 2015, it caught fire , shortly after which the local council approved plans to change the site into flats and a convenience store. St Faith's Church lies at the centre of the ward at the crossroads on the A505 with Willian Road and Woolgrove Road, built in the 1890s by the Rev'd Gainsford as a Mission Church. A community festival takes place each May on Walsworth Common. Run solely by volunteers, it is held 11am - 4pm on a Sunday in the middle of the month. The Festival which has been running since 1974 and it has something for all the family with charity stalls, funfair rides and refreshments as well as live entertainment in the form of arena events and a music tent. There is a nature reserve and recreational area at Purwell Meadows. The areas alongside the River Purwell were once notorious for regular flooding although in recent years, drainage improvements associated with house building appear to have alleviated the problem. However, heavy rain has caused flooding at the Walsworth cross roads as recently as September 2011, causing the road to be closed by the college. Flooding to a depth of approximately 8 cm affects the entrance of Chaucer Way with the meadows adjoining Chaucer Way and Purwell Lane regularly becoming flooded to a depth of . Since the construction of housing along the flood plain, the river can completely dry up during periods of drought.

Early years Grove was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her mother was \\"an exhibition ballroom dancer\\" who performed with Ray Bolger and Jack Haley, among others. Grove took her first dancing lessons at age 4 and at 11 was performing professionally by singing and dancing for service clubs in Cambridge. She attended Longfellow Grammar School and Cambridge High and Latin School. As a high school student, she performed for department stores' fashion shows in Boston. Stage In 1950, Grove debuted on Broadway in the 1948 original production of Kiss Me, Kate, playing Lois Lane/Bianca, a lead role that was originated by Lisa Kirk (whom she replaced). She appeared on Broadway in three other shows as well: The 1968 original production of George M!; the 1979 original production of I Remember Mama; and the 1983 revival of On Your Toes. Television Grove's network television debut came on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1949. That same year, after three auditions, she became the featured singer on ABC-TV's Stop the Music. A 1951 review of Stop the Music emphasized the \\"showmanly flair of Miss Grove and [Bert] Parks.\\" In a 1952 magazine article, Parks described Grove's activities during five months in 1950 when she was in both Stop the Music on TV and Kiss Me Kate on Broadway: > At 7:30 every Thursday night she would rush into a dressing room at ABC's > Ritz Theatre on West 48th Street, change into her TV costume, tear on stage > for her numbers, change again into her first act Kiss Me Kate togs, make a > beeline for the Shubert Theatre on West 44th Street, arriving just in time > for her on-stage cue.

Roughly 340 EV Plus models were produced and released. Production of the EV Plus was discontinued in 1999 after Honda announced the release of its first hybrid electric vehicle, the Honda Insight. The EV Plus served to test advanced battery chemistry in an electric car and also met California Air Resources Board requirements for zero-emission vehicles, like the General Motors EV1. It also tested the pancake-style motor, electronic control unit, power control unit and the Nickel–metal hydride battery (NiMH) later used in Honda hybrids and developed further in the first Honda FCX Fuel Cell Vehicles, which were rebuilt from returned (decommissioned) EV Plus chassis. Development Honda began development of an electric vehicle (EV) in April 1988, inspired in part by the General Motors Sunraycer, which won the World Solar Challenge in 1987, and with an intent to meet increasingly stringent future emissions standards. The first electric vehicle team at Honda had just four people. At the time, Honda was the last automotive company in Japan to start work on electric vehicles. Early obstacles were discovered; electric traction motors that were powerful or efficient were too large to fit, energy storage density using existing lead-acid technology was similarly too low, and the time required to recharge was inconvenient. Besides the technical challenges, California issued a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate in late 1990, requiring manufacturers to sell 2% of their total sales as ZEVs, starting in 1998. With that in mind, Honda devoted approximately 100 employees to begin full-scale EV development early in 1991. A first prototype was designed, based on the existing three-door hatchback Civic, retrofitted with commercially-available electric motor and lead-acid batteries, and modified with numerous weight-saving measures, including aluminum body panels and acrylic plastic windows; it was completed in July 1991 and ran without issues. Although EV project team members were relieved that it was operable, project leader Junichi Araki was furious: \\"You call this a car? What the heck did you just make? Why don't you just dig a hole, and bury it!\\" Over the next two hours, Araki explained his anger: the finished product was a shameful compromise and merely an excuse for Honda's inexperience with EVs. \\"As long as we continue trying a variety of measures in a project, each car we produce must constitute a learning experience that leads to the next step. If a car doesn't lead to greater experience, we might as well not build it. I was so disappointed that they hadn't put more passion into the project.\\" The team refocused their goal \\"to make a good electric vehicle, with no compromises.\\" As an example, the Honda EV project's powerplant team began working with battery manufacturers, proposing a battery format and size that were later adopted as a global standard. In addition, they began developing their own DC brushless motor, since commercially- available motors were not efficient enough. By June 1992, Honda had begun development of a purpose-built prototype, which led to the EV-X, a working concept vehicle exhibited at Tokyo in 1993, then powertrain testing with the Clean Urban Vehicle-4 (CUV-4), a converted Civic hatchback, gathering test data starting in August 1994. Over the next two years, the fleet of ten CUV-4s would be driven for an aggregate in partnership with California utilities Pacific Gas & Electric (operating five) and Southern California Edison (three). These tests convinced Honda that lead-acid batteries were unsuitable as the main storage for a production-level electric vehicle. The CUV-4 had a limited range of just , prompting tweaks to the basic vehicle specifications that were later realized in the EV Plus, including battery voltage, chemistry, and motor power. A prototype EV Plus was assembled in December 1995, and production was approved in January 1996; the first production EV Plus left the line at Takanezawa in April 1997. Features The EV Plus featured on-board conductive charging with the Avcon connector, passive battery balancing, regenerative braking and deceleration, AC/heat-pump climate control, HID headlights, 4 seats, and electrically heated windshield. The car was equipped with an oil-fired heater for faster cabin heating and passenger comfort, but the heater was not operable until the ambient temperature was below to comply with California ZEV standards. The heater had an output of . The EV Plus came with a 12 V battery to power standard automotive accessories and lighting. Vehicles also featured: * CD player * Power windows * Power door locks * Remote key fob controlled Air conditioning * Electrically heated windshield Performance *Track Front/Rear: 59.1 in/58.7 in (1.50 m/1.49 m) *Drive Train: Front-wheel drive *Occupants: Four *Transmission: Single Speed with Reverse *Charger: On-board Conductive *Recharge: 8 hours with 220 V charger, 35 hours with 110 V emergency charger. *Acceleration: 4.9 s (0-30 mph) *Maximum Speed: 80+ mph (130 km/h) *Colors: dark green, bronze, silver The traction motor output rating was at 8,750 RPM and . Battery capacity was 28.7 kW-hr; the battery weighed and occupied a volume of . Using a 110-volt \\"emergency\\" charger, approximately 24 hours were required for a complete charge; in contrast, the 220-volt charger was able to restore 80% of charge in 2 hours. Under instrumented testing, the EV Plus required approximately 7 hours to fully charge its battery at a rate of just over 5 kW. At introduction, Honda cautioned potential drivers that actual driving range was limited to . Southern California Edison tested a Honda EV Plus at Pomona, California and determined the range was between (freeway loop, with auxiliary loads) to (urban loop, without auxiliary loads). As with virtually all vehicles, range was affected by driving style: rapid acceleration, high speeds, and fast stops lowered the all-electric range significantly. United States Environmental Protection Agency rated the range at , and careful driving would give it a range of just over . Consumption is rated at ; using an electricity equivalent of 33.7 kW-hr per gallon of gasoline, that gives an equivalent efficiency of combined, city/highway. A race-prepared EV Plus set a new record for electric vehicles at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in 1999 by finishing in 15:19.91. The special EV Plus, prepared and driven by Teruo Sugita, had been converted to mid-engine, rear-wheel drive and fitted with extra batteries. Sales and production The EV Plus was listed with an MSRP of $53,999, but Honda never allowed them to be sold, instead offering the cars on a 3-year, lease-only program for $455.00 per month. The cost of the battery pack alone was estimated at , and consumers were warned the battery would need to be replaced every three years, necessitating the lease program. Lease customers were required to install a 220-volt charger. The lease cost included comprehensive collision coverage, all maintenance, and roadside assistance. The EV Plus was first available to California drivers starting on May 14, 1997, with four dealerships (three in Southern California and one in Sacramento) offering the new model; eight were leased within a week of release. By December, only 79 had been leased. From May 1997 to July 1998, Honda leased 177 EV Plus vehicles in southern California. 15 EV Plus vehicles were leased to the University of California, Riverside as the basis of a car- sharing program; on average, 100 trips per day were taken by faculty, staff, and students, with most trips lasting less than . The final EV Plus was assembled in April 1999; in total, approximately 325 were leased to customers: 300 in the United States, 20 in Japan, and 5 in Europe. At the time Honda announced it would discontinue production, it promised to continue to re-lease and service the EV Plus indefinitely. Honda allowed some customers to extend their EV Plus lease for a few years. At the end of the leases, all EV Plus cars were taken back by Honda, decommissioned, and eventually destroyed. A few Honda EV Plus chassis were used as the base for some of Honda's first hydrogen () fuel cell vehicle prototypes. The platform and drivetrain of the EV Plus were reused for the Honda FCX, a fuel cell vehicle. Instead of the high- voltage traction battery of the EV Plus, the FCX used hydrogen stored on-board in a fuel cell reactor to generate electricity. Then those prototypes were also destroyed.

Administration Sectors of Tombali Coat of Arms during Portuguese Rule Tombali is divided into five sectors namely Bedanda, Cacine, Catio, and Komo. Guinea-Bissau got independence from Portugal on 24 September 1973 after wars and diplomatic political actions under the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), while Portugal accepted the independence of Cape Verde on 5 July 1975. PAIGC ruled both the countries after independence. While international funds came pouring in for the economic development of the nation, the party was accused of misusing power in authoritarian manner. The one-party state mechanism was turbulent during the period of 1980s and 1990s with army taking control of power more frequently and the resultant civil war resulted in loss of property and lives. To decentralize power, an administrative region and eight regions were created. There has not been any local administration since the civil war of 1998-99 and all the social services are done by organs of civil society and other government agencies. There is minimal health and education services offered by the government and all the government departments have operated in a limited fashion. A transitional government was selected during 2003-4 with an adopted Public Transition Charter. The Military Committee appointed two civilians as interim President and Prime Minister. Elections were held for a five year term on 24 July 2005 with a multi party representation. There was a military coup in 2012, after which EU and international donations stopped. The latest elections were held during April 2014 with 13 Presidential candidates and representation from 15 parties. The elections were monitored by 550 international observers. Jose Mario Vaz and his party, won the Presidential and parliamentary elections against the military backed Nuno Gomes Nabiam.

The series was internationally controversial, and was not screened by BBC Three, the channel which commissioned it. Outline The series follows the doodles and scribblings of a student at school during a lesson. His drawings depict the life of Father Nicholas, who lives in a Vatican City parody referred to as \\"Popetown\\". He is charged with being the handler for the Pope (who is always referred to by his title, and never given any name) who is a complete nincompoop with the emotional and mental maturity of a four-year-old. Father Nicholas must keep the Pope out of trouble, and make sure the general public does not find out that the Holy Father is a drooling idiot. Other characters include a priest who is a sexual deviant, an extremely buxom and vain nun who serves as the Popetown news anchor and a trio of corrupt cardinals who secretly run Popetown and attempt to get rich behind the Pope's back. These and other elements caused the show to be extremely controversial. The original English-language version of the show features the voices of actor and Popetown writer Mackenzie Crook, Little Britain co-creator Matt Lucas, providing the voice for one of the cardinals, and actress Jerry Hall. Ruby Wax is the voice actor for The Pope. The series was originally commissioned by BBC Three in the United Kingdom, but was dropped from scheduling without a screening in the wake of protests from Roman Catholics. The premiere screened on New Zealand's C4 television network on 8 June 2005. Despite never being shown on British television, it was eventually released on DVD in the UK by Revolver Entertainment on 5 September 2005, in Australia by Roadshow Entertainment and in Germany, where it was aired on television, by Polyband. It was also currently aired on several MTV channels, including MTV Latin America, MTV Latvia, MTV Estonia and others. The show was also banned in some countries (for example, Lithuania).  Controversy New Zealand= The Catholic Church in New Zealand had been considering laying a complaint to the Broadcasting Standards Authority . Bishops called for a boycott of all CanWest television and radio stations. C4 had received many complaints about the show but refused to pull it from its lineup. = Germany = In Germany, where insulting religious groups is a crime, MTV broadcast the first episode on 3 May 2006. After an advertisement was published at the start of the Holy Week featuring Jesus in a chair watching TV (with the heading \\"laugh instead of hanging around\\"), both MTV and the series drew sharp criticism from some Christians in Germany; the office of the archbishop of Munich said it is investigating an injunction to block the series. Popetown became a topic of public debate, even though few have had the opportunity to see the show. The Christian Churches as well as the Jewish and Muslim Community and conservative politicians demanded that MTV withdraw the series. An evangelical magazine has put up an anti-Popetown website, stoppt- popetown.de. The Archbishop of Munich and the parliamentary leader of the conservative CSU party in Bavaria demanded criminal prosecution of those responsible for the series under § 166 of the Penal Code, the \\"blasphemy clause\\". Edmund Stoiber, leader of the CSU, also demanded more severe punishments for slander of religious feelings. Nondenominational organizations like the IBKA and others argued that satire must be allowed and censorship must not take place. Supporters of the series brought forward the argument that Popetown cannot be forbidden, just as the Muhammad cartoons are allowed for reasons of press freedom. After a discussion on MTV, which ended up with some 87% of online voters supporting broadcast, MTV decided to broadcast all of the other episodes. The experts taking position in the show said they would not broadcast it, but also not forbid it. =United States= The series has yet to be broadcast or released on DVD in the United States, but it has spread by word of mouth, YouTube, and file sharing networks. In the 20 April 2006 edition of his weekly column, Parents Television Council founder L. Brent Bozell wrote an article criticizing Viacom for airing this anti-Christian series on MTV Germany as well as allowing a scene defacing Jesus Christ in the episode of the American animated series South Park, \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\". In America, South Park is broadcast on the Viacom network Comedy Central. =Lithuania= In March 2007, the MTV Baltics network was fined 3,000 litas (896 EUR) by the Lithuanian broadcasting regulator for airing the animation. In response, MTV series director Marius Veselis accused Lithuania of unmasking itself as a \\"sort of half-medieval, half-communist, sick culture\\".  Credits Crew= The show was written by a combination of seven different writers: *Kevin Eldon *James Bachman *Mackenzie Crook *Isabelle Dubernet *Mark Evans *Eric Fuhrer *Phil Ox *David Quantick Phil Ox also served as director and producer for the series.

It was destroyed by Hurricane Emily in 2005; a replacement, Joyxee Island, has been open for tours since 2008. Spiral Island has been featured in a number of newspapers and TV documentaries around the world, including in Japan and South Korea, and has been featured in an episode of the Ripley's Believe It or Not! TV series, and on the MTV program Extreme Cribs in 2011. Spiral Island The first Spiral island was located in a lagoon near Puerto Aventuras, on the Caribbean coast of Mexico south of Cancún; Richart Sowa began constructing it in 1998. He filled nets with empty discarded plastic bottles to support a structure of plywood and bamboo, on which he poured sand and planted numerous plants, including mangroves. The island sported a two-story house, a solar oven, a self-composting toilet, and three beaches. He used some 250,000 bottles for the structure. Sowa was ordered to take the island out of the man- made canal in 2004 because many private homes and condos were being built and he lived for one year tied to the end of a loose rock pier. Sowa was offered a new location in the bay of Soliman about 200 km (124 mi) south. Finally, he was permitted by Port authorities to tow Spiral Island, but the island was destroyed by Hurricane Emily in 2005. Joyxee Island In late 2007 and 2008, Sowa built a replacement for Spiral Island in the waters of Isla Mujeres, the \\"Island of Women\\", also near Cancun. It opened for tours in August 2008. The new island was initially in diameter and contained about 100,000 bottles. It has since expanded to 25 metres (82 ft) due to various plants and mangroves growing from the island. The new island has three beaches, a house, two ponds, a wave-powered washing machine, solar panels, a solar-powered waterfall and river. The island is a constant work in progress with volunteers and Sowa himself continually making improvements. In May 2011, Reishee embarked on a project to berth his island out in Isla Mujeres Bay, as it was now too big for its current site off a pier in Laguna Majax. The Mexican Government also recognized Joyxee Island as an \\"Eco Boat\\" and therefore needed to comply with all current boating regulations, which involved the purchase of fire extinguishers, life ring buoys and emergency kits. The project was launched on kickstarter.com with a goal of $18,000 that it failed to reach. Reishee later successfully relaunched the project with a more conservative $9,000 goal. Joyxee Island was open for tours at one point. However, it is no longer in the lagoon and was closed in 2016.

He was born with the title of His Royal Highness Prince Yi Gong. Sunjo was the 2nd son of King Jeongjo which King Jeongjo had with Lady Subin, one of King Jeongjo's concubines. Biography Sunjo ascended to the throne at age 10 in 1800 upon the death of his father, King Jeongjo. In 1802, King Sunjo married Lady Kim of Andong, known posthumously as Queen Sunwon, daughter of Kim Jo-sun who was a leader of Andong Kim clan. Since he ascended the throne at a young age, Queen Dowager Jeongsun, the second queen of King Yeongjo, ruled as queen regent, which allowed her to wield power over state affairs. Despite King Sunjo's efforts to reform politics, the fundamental principles of government deteriorated. The state examination became disordered and corruption in the government personnel administration prevailed. This resulted in disorder in society and various riots broke out among the people, including the revolt by Hong Gyeong-nae in 1811-1812. The Ogajaktongbeop (五家作統法), a census registration system to group five houses as one unit, was carried out in this period, and oppression against Roman Catholicism began in earnest. King Sunjo died after reigning for 35 years in 1834 at the age of 44. He was first buried next to Jangneung, Paju, the tomb of King Injo and Queen Inyeo but later moved to Illeung, Seoul as the Feng Shui at the old site was deemed to be unfavourable.

The Imperial Japanese government first started issuing the military yen during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. The military yen reached its peak during the Pacific War period, when the Japanese government excessively issued it to all of its occupied territories. In Hong Kong, the military yen was forced upon the local population as the sole official currency of the territory. Since the military yen was not backed by gold, and did not have a specific place of issuance, the military yen could not be exchanged for the Japanese yen. Forcing local populations to use the military yen officially was one of the ways the Japanese government could dominate the local economies. Currencies in territories occupied by Japan The territories controlled or occupied by Japan had many different currencies. Taiwan maintained its own banking system and bank notes after it came under Japanese sovereignty in 1895. The same is true for Korea post 1910. Between 1931 and 1945, large parts of China and South East Asia were occupied by Japan. Several types of currencies were put into circulation there during the occupation. In China, several puppet governments were created (e.g. Manchukuo), each issuing their own currency. In South East Asia, the Japanese military arranged for bank notes to be issued, denominated in the various currencies (rupees, pesos, dollars, etc.) that had been circulating there prior to the occupation. These latter are referred to as Japanese invasion money. In addition to these currencies, the Japanese military issued their own bank notes, denominated in yen - this is the Japanese military yen. The military yen became the official currency in some occupied areas, e.g. Hong Kong. Design features of the Japanese military yen 10 Yen note of the 1938 series. In the late 1930s there was an issue of military yen which was similar to the standard yen in terms of design, but with minor modifications. Generally, thick red lines were overprinted to cancel the name \\"Bank of Japan\\" (日本銀行) and any text promising to pay the bearer in gold or silver. Large red text instead indicated that the note was military currency (\\"軍用手票\\") so as not to be confused with regular Japanese yen. Later series were less crude. In the early 1940s, the Japanese government issued military yen notes with a design prepared specifically for the military yen. These designs were not based on existing Japanese yen notes, but featured original designs such as Onagadori cocks and dragons. All later series featured the following text on the reverse of the note: :此票一到即換正面所開日本通貨。如有偽造、變造、仿造、或知情行使者均應重罰不貸。 This text explains: \\"This note is exchangeable to Japanese currency upon presentation. Severe punishment will be applied to anyone who counterfeits notes or knowingly uses such notes.\\" Early issues did not have serial numbers, and were issued without regard for inflation. Later issues did initially feature serial numbers. Towards the end of the war, as more money was needed to pay military personnel, notes were issued without serial numbers once more. The military yen in Hong Kong After the Hong Kong Government surrendered to the Japanese Imperial Army on 25 December 1941, the Japanese authorities decreed the military yen to be the legal tender of Hong Kong the following day. *\\"Japan urged to cash military notes for H.K. holders\\" , Asian Economic News, 1999-6-7. Retrieved 14 June 1999. The Japanese occupation also outlawed any use of Hong Kong dollar and set a deadline for exchanging dollars into yen. When the military yen was first introduced on 26 December 1941, the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the military yen was 2 to 1. However, by October 1942, the rate was changed to 4 to 1. After exchanging for Hong Kong dollars, the Japanese military purchased supplies and strategic goods in the neighbouring neutral Portuguese colony of Macao. As Japan became more desperate in the war effort in 1944, the Japanese military authorities in Hong Kong circulated more military yen, resulting in hyperinflation. After Japan announced its unconditional surrender on 15 August 1945, military yen banknotes were seized by British military authorities. However, although there was about as much as 1.9 billion yen, the Japanese military administrations intentionally destroyed 700 million worth of it. Nullification of the military yen and demands for redemption On 6 September 1945, the Japanese Ministry of Finance announced that all military yen became void, reducing the military yen to useless pieces of paper. On 13 August 1993, an organization in Hong Kong seeking a refund for military yen took legal action against Japan, suing the Japanese government for the money that was lost when the military yen was declared void. A Tokyo district court ruled against the plaintiff on 17 June 1999, stating that, although it acknowledged the suffering of the Hong Kong people, the government of Japan did not have specific laws concerning military yen compensation. Japan also used the Treaty of San Francisco, of which the United Kingdom was a signatory state, as one of the reasons to deny compensation.

The outdoor events were generally held in forest environments around Victoria, Australia, with some events held in Queensland and overseas in New Caledonia. Earthcore has operated since 1992. After the Earthcore Carnival that ran from the 28th to 30 November 2008, Earthcore took a hiatus before returning for their 20-year anniversary celebration in November 2013. Earthcore returned to its traditional ground roots festival beginning with the 20 year anniversary in 2013 to celebrate the event that introduced Australia to the outdoor electronic dance music festival. With a new home amongst the rolling hills of Pyalong in country Victoria, Earthcore was again held in November 2014 with one of the largest lineups to date including favourites Hallucinogen and Shpongle as headliners. Earthcore continued to operate in Pyalong until 2016 and moved to Elmore Victoria for the 2017 festival. History Michele Adamson at Earthcore 2006 Over the years, events included large outdoor festivals, one night weekly club events, warehouse parties, one- off large-scale indoor parties, events on boats and a club on a moving train. The peak Earthcore event was the 2000 New Year's Eve party which went for seven days and was attended by up to 15,000 people over the seven days. Controversies In 2017, Earthcore events in three states were cancelled abruptly. Earthcore blamed the cancellations on what they alleged was a smear campaign by international artist Coming Soon.. However, many of the bands countered that the cancellations were in fact because they hadn't been paid for their performances, and hadn't been given their air tickets, and so wouldn't be attending. The event \\"lost up to 32 acts\\" the day before the event, with the Herald Sun reporting \\"Many artists have posted disgruntled messages on their Facebook pages, many claiming they have not been paid and many saying their flights to Australia had not been booked\\". This included a number of the headlining acts, such as Juno Reactor, Animato and Electric Universe. Earthcore then alleged that many artists were paid and kept the fees and did not perform. In all, the Western Australia, New South Wales & Queensland events were cancelled, the Victorian event proceeded with a reduced lineup. A number of companies relating to the management of Earthcore have suffered from financial problems. Spiro Boursine, founder and main organiser of Earthcore, died on the 24th of October, 2018, leaving the future of the events unknown, including an upcoming large scale event meant to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the event.

Darwin's fox was first collected from San Pedro Island off the coast of Chile by the naturalist Charles Darwin in 1834. It was long held that Darwin's fox was a subspecies of the South American gray fox (L. griseus); however, the discovery of a small population of Darwin's fox on the mainland in Nahuelbuta National Park in 1990Medel, R.G. et al. 1990. Discovery of a continental population of the rare Darwin fox, Dusicyon fulvipes (Martin, 1839) in Chile. Biological Conservation 51:71-77 and subsequent genetic analysis has clarified the fox's status as a unique species.Yahnke, C.J. et al. 1996. Darwin's Fox: A Distinct Endangered Species in a Vanishing Habitat. Conservation Biology 10:366-375 In 2012 and 2013 the presence of the Darwin's fox at Oncol Park, Alerce Costero National Park and the Valdivian Coastal Reserve was confirmed through camera trapping. Taxonomy and evolution Pseudalopex is a South American genus of canine distantly related to wolves and is technically not a fox. When Charles Darwin collected a specimen from San Pedro Island in Chiloé Archipelago in December 1834 during the Beagle survey expedition, he observed that this \\"fox (of Chiloe, a rare animal) sat on the point & was so absorbed in watching [survey work], that he allowed me to walk behind him & actually kill him with my geological hammer\\".Keynes, R. D. ed. 2001. Charles Darwin's Beagle diary. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 272–273 In the 1839 publication of his Journal and Remarks, Darwin said \\"This fox, more curious or more scientific, but less wise, than the generality of his brethren, is now mounted in the museum of the Zoological Society.\\" He said it was \\"an undescribed species\\",Darwin, C. R. 1839. Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, Journal and Remarks 1832–1836. London: Henry Colburn. p. 341 indicating that it was distinct from the species (L. culpaeus and L. griseus) that occur on the mainland. Later, Darwin's fox was classified as a subspecies (Lycalopex griseus fulvipes) of the latter. Darwin's fox does not interbreed with the other Lycalopex species, only lives in forests, and is smaller and darker- colored than the other species. In 1990 a small population of Darwin's fox was found on the mainland in the forested Nahuelbuta National Park, indicating that the fox was not endemic to the island. According to Yahnke et al., in their 1996 article published in the Journal of the Society for Conservation Biology, analysis of mitochondrial DNA of Darwin's fox and the gray fox showed two patterns, indicating Darwin's fox was a new species, closely related to the Sechuran fox. Also according to Yahnke (1995; et al.1996) the present restricted range is a relic of a much wider former range. Zoologists noted the distinctiveness in the ecological niche, appearance, and behavior of this species. Darwin's fox is differentiated from the gray fox in being darker; having shorter legs; a broader, shorter skull; smaller auditory bullae; a more robust dentition; and a different jaw shape and style of premolar occlusion. A male Darwin's fox in Ahuenco, Chiloé Island, Chile In the late Pleistocene, Chiloé Island was connected to mainland Chile by a land bridge. The land bridge was severed about 15,000 years ago when the sea level rose following the last glaciation.Villagrán, C. 1988. Late Quaternary vegetation of Southern Isla Grande de Chiloë, Chile. Quaternary Research 29: 294–306 This created two isolated populations of Darwin's fox. Diet Darwin's fox has a vast diet. In dense forests, where it exists, the foxes hunt for mammals, reptiles, beetles, and invertebrates. Sometimes it selects fruits and berries. Birds and amphibians to a lesser degree are also consumed. It sometimes eats carrion, but it mostly eats live animals and fruit. This makes it mostly an omnivore, sometimes a scavenger. Ecology Darwin's fox is generally believed to be a forest obligate species found only in southern temperate rainforests. They only occur in areas of primary forest on Chiloé and on the mainland. They are most active at twilight and before sunrise. In contrast to other Lycalopex species, Darwin's fox prefers open spaces. The population of Chiloé has about 200 individuals, and Nahuelbuta on the mainland contains about 50 individuals. The total population size is about 250 mature individuals with at least 90% of the population occurring in one subspopulation (Chiloé Island). Although the species is protected in Nahuelbuta National Park, substantial mortality sources exist when foxes move to lower, unprotected private areas in search of milder conditions during the winter.Jiménez, J.E., Lucherini, M. & Novaro, A.J., 2004; IUCN & CSG 2004). On mainland Chile, Jaime Jiménez has observed a small population since 1975 in Nahuelbuta National Park; this population was first reported to science in the early 1990s (Medel et al. 1990; Jiménez, J.E., Lucherini, M. & Novaro, A.J., 2004; IUCN, 2004 Conservation status The species was previously classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN, but in 2016 was downlisted to Endangered, as its area occurrences is apparently substantially larger than originally believed. Current estimates of the total population are still low, with an estimated minimum 227 individuals on the mainland and 412 on Chiloé Island. Fragmentation of forest adjacent to the national park and on the island is a concern for their conservation, and feral dogs may pose the greatest threat to their survival by spreading disease or directly attacking. Persecution by people who think that the foxes attack domestic fowls, though they pose little threat, is also a potential problem.  Diseases  The species is often plagued by Mycoplasma haemocanis. The already endangered fox is prone to this infection because the infections bacteria then attaches itself to surface red blood cells of many mammals, and although the species is believed to be no major threat to human life this infection can spread to humans, dogs, cats, and other wildlife species. The bacteria also seems to spike when located closer to any major habitat inhabited by humans as well as where there is a large population of wild dogs present near the species. Researchers are testing RNA subunits of RNase P gene and out of 10 foxes, 9 were infected. Even though they are considered “sick”, they have no external symptoms (Cabello, 2013). Studies show that many foxes risk of catching the deadly bacteria inclines as they age leaving many older foxes vulnerable. Although the disease is prevalent in this specie little to nothing is known about this diseaseHidalgo-Hermoso, Ezequiel, et al.

The book is a first person (and somewhat autobiographical) narrative told from the viewpoint of Israel David Goodkind, the third of the four generations in the book. Goodkind works in a minor bureaucratic post in the White House between March and October 1973; his insignificance gives him time to write his memoirs (the book itself, told as though Goodkind wrote it) while his position gives him opportunities to come face to face with the harried president Richard Nixon. Nixon never is named in the book, but there can be no doubt as to his identity. The narrative refers explicitly to the Watergate scandal, as an event contemporaneous with Goodkind's employment in the White House. Plot summary The story alternates between Goodkind's telling his family history and early years (specifically, his first 26 years (1915–1941)) and his account of current events in 1973, leading up to the Yom Kippur War. The tales of Goodkind's early years describe his family – his mother and father, his sister, his mother's father and father's mother, his mother's half sister, and a tribe of more distant uncles, aunts and cousins (the 'Mishpokha', Yiddish for 'family'). After college, Goodkind works for Harry Goldhandler, a gag writer for radio comedies (very loosely based on David Freedman), and has a romance with showgirl Bobbie Webb. The tales of his present day in 1973 are centered on his wife, his daughter, their friends, and Peter Quat, a college friend who also worked for Goldhandler, and who had become a famous novelist for his sexually explicit characters and unflattering depictions of American Jewish life. Quat's books seem similar to the work of Philip Roth, but Roth did not attend Columbia nor work for Freedman. As a young man, Goodkind becomes less observant, but his adult self has returned to the Orthodox practices of his father and grandfather. Goodkind as a child and young man is embarrassed by his first name Israel, mockingly shortened by several other characters to Izzy. In the last scene of the novel when Goodkind returns to the U.S. after the Yom Kippur War, he tells an El Al flight attendant to call him Israel. References to history and geography Among the famous people Goodkind comes face to face with in the course of the book besides Nixon are Golda Meir, Zero Mostel, Bert Lahr, Marlene Dietrich, John Barrymore, Ernest Hemingway, Leslie Howard, and the brothers George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin. Goodkind visits Israel during the Yom Kippur War, carries a secret letter from Golda Meir to Richard Nixon, and rides back to Israel with the U.S. Air Force airlift of supplies.

The Symphony was written between 1938 and 1940 on a commission from American philanthropist Mrs. Robert Woods Bliss. It was a turbulent period of the composer's life, marked by illness and deaths in his immediate family. In 1937, Stravinsky was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which had already forced his wife and two daughters to a sanatorium in Switzerland. Stravinsky's daughter Ludmilla and wife Catherine died of their illnesses in November 1938 and March 1939, respectively, followed by Stravinsky's own quarantine and the death of his mother Anna in June 1939.Phillip Huscher, Program Notes: Symphony in C (Chicago: Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 2008); Igor Stravinsky, Liner notes for Stravinsky: Symphony in Three Movements; Symphony in C; Symphony of Psalms (CBS Records MK 42434, 1963/1988), pp. 4–5.

Stravinsky was still mourning the deaths of his family members when World War II forced him to leave Europe.Phillip Huscher, Program Notes: Symphony in C (Chicago: Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 2008); Michael Oliver, Igor Stravinsky (London: Phaidon Press Limited, 1995), p. 138. He had written the symphony's first two movements in France and Switzerland. Stravinsky wrote the third movement in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the fourth movement in Hollywood, after his emigration to the United States.Igor Stravinsky, Liner notes for Stravinsky: Symphony in Three Movements; Symphony in C; Symphony of Psalms (CBS Records MK 42434, 1963/1988), pp. 4–5. The symphony was premiered by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Stravinsky on November 7, 1940.Philip Huscher, Program Notes: Symphony in C (Chicago: Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 2008). The Symphony in C is representative of Stravinsky's neoclassical period, which had been launched by his ballet Pulcinella (1919–20), the opera Mavra (1921–22), and Octet for winds (1922–23). The symphony has a traditional, four-movement structure and lasts approximately 30 minutes: The Symphony in C is entirely abstract and seems a retreat into the \\"pure music\\" styles of Bach, Beethoven, and Haydn. Stravinsky disclaimed any link between his personal experiences and the symphony's content.Jonathan Cross, The Cambridge Companion to Stravinsky (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 115.Huscher Program Notes. Regarding its style, Stravinsky acknowledged a division of the symphony into halves.Stravinsky, liner notes, p. 5. The first two movements, composed in Europe, use more traditional rhythmic patterns and harmonizations. The last two movements use frequent modulations of rhythm and are much more chromatic. Stravinsky's misfortunes apart, the Symphony in C had been infrequently performed in the composer's lifetime; Stravinsky noted that for several years he was the only person conducting the work.Stravinsky, Liner notes. p. 5. The work was choreographed by Martha Graham in the late 1980s. She named the result \\"Persephone\\" in ironic reference to another major work by Stravinsky. Although Graham choreographed all four movements, only the three-movement version was performed on stage.

It is the most north-westerly community in the European Union. Its most northerly point is the Butt of Lewis. The name Ness derives from the old Norse for headland and many of the other place names in the area also have a Norse origin. Entry \\"nes\\", on page 312 in: Geir T. Zoëga (1910). \\"A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic\\" - archive.org Ness is part of the Galson Estate which is owned by Urras Oighreachd Ghabhsainn (Galson Estate Trust) which is managed by 10 local trustees elected by the community. The hand-over took place on 12 January 2007. Ness is accessible via the A857 road and is about by road from Stornoway. You can also reach Ness by walking across the moor from North Tolsta in Back to Skigersta. It is about and takes 6 hours at a leisurely pace. Scottish Gaelic is the language of the community with 75% being able to speak it. Peat cut from the moor, is used as a fuel for cooking and heating in many homes, but its use is on the decline. The 2001 Census results show a resident population of just under 1,000. In 1831 Ness had a population of just over 3,000. Landmarks include the 13th- century Teampull Mholuaidh in Eoropie and the small island of Dùn Èistean which is the ancestral home of the Lewis Morrisons of the Clan Morrison. There is a road sign to the bridge across to Dùn Èistean, and archaeological excavations have been taking place there. Morrisons of Harris and Lewis can traditionally be found around Nis, and in the north-west Highlands in the county of Sutherland around the town of Durness (Scottish Gaelic: Diùranais). Each year 10 men from Ness go out to the island of Sula Sgeir in late August for two weeks to harvest around 2,000 young gannets known locally as Guga. The Guga hunt is a Ness tradition and the bird considered a delicacy. A Ness boat builder called John F. Macleod from Port saved 40 lives following the sinking of the Iolaire by managing to take a line to shore. Ness is known for its Sgoth, a type of clinker built skiff with a dipping lug sail. The boats were used for line fishing until the early half of the twentieth century. There are several still in active use owned by community trusts which maintain them. School Lionel School is the school providing for Ness. Lionel School prides itself on its sporting prowess and pupils have won trophies for football, running, badminton and swimming. The school roll is 116. The small School at Cross closed in 2011 due to falling rolls, latterly having only 19 pupils. The buildings have now been taken over by Comunn Eachdraidh Nis, the Ness Historical Society. Sport Football is the main sport with Ness FC playing their home matches on Fivepenny Machair. 'Spors Nis' is a new (2007) Community Sports Centre with all the modern facilities you would expect including a two lane 10 pin bowling alley. Lionel School also has a swimming pool which is open to the public when not in use by the school.

A poikilotherm () is an animal whose internal temperature varies considerably. It is the opposite of a homeotherm, an animal which maintains thermal homeostasis. While the term in principle can apply to all organisms, it is generally only applied to animals, and mostly to vertebrates. Usually the fluctuations are consequence of variation in the ambient environmental temperature. Many terrestrial ectotherms are poikilothermic. However some ectotherms remain in temperature-constant environments to the point that they are actually able to maintain a constant internal temperature (i.e. are homeothermic). It is this distinction that often makes the term \\"poikilotherm\\" more useful than the vernacular \\"cold- blooded\\", which is sometimes used to refer to ectotherms more generally. Poikilothermic animals include types of vertebrate animals, specifically some fish, amphibians, and reptiles, as well as many invertebrate animals.

Hubrecht and J. Kirkwood (Eds). Wiley-Blackwell. Chapter 25, pp. 359-369 and sloth are some of the rare mammals which are poikilothermic.  Etymology  The term derives from Greek poikilos (), meaning \\"varied,\\" ultimately from a root meaning \\"dappled\\" or “painted,” and thermos (), meaning \\"heat\\".  Physiology  Sustained energy output of a poikilotherm (a lizard) and a homeotherm (a mouse) as a function of core body temperature. The homeotherm has a much higher output, but can only function over a very narrow range of body temperatures. Poikilotherm animals must be able to function over a wider range of temperatures than homeotherms. The speed of most chemical reactions vary with temperature, and in order to function poikilotherms may have four to ten enzyme systems that operate at different temperatures for an important chemical reaction. As a result, poikilotherms often have larger, more complex genomes than homeotherms in the same ecological niche. Frogs are a notable example of this effect, though their complex development is also an important factor in their large genome. Because their metabolism is variable and generally below that of homeothermic animals, sustained high-energy activities like powered flight in large animals or maintaining a large brain is generally beyond poikilotherm animals.Willmer, P., Stone, G., & Johnston, I. A. (2000): Environmental physiology of animals. Blackwell Science, London. 644 pages, . The metabolism of poikilotherms favors strategies such as sit-and-wait hunting over chasing prey for larger animals with high movement cost. As they do not use their metabolisms to heat or cool themselves, total energy requirement over time is low. For the same body weight, poikilotherms need only 5 to 10% of the energy of homeotherms.Campbell, N. A., Reece, J. B., et al. (2002). Biology. 6th edition. Benjamin / Cummings Publishing Company. Adaptations in poikilotherms *Some adaptations are behavioral. Lizards and snakes bask in the sun in the early morning and late evening, and seek shelter around noon. *The eggs of the yellow-faced bumblebee are unable to regulate heat. A behavioral adaptation to combat this is incubation, where to maintain the internal temperatures of eggs, the queen and her workers will incubate the brood almost constantly, by warming their abdomens and touching them to the eggs. The bumblebee generates heat by shivering flight muscles even though they are not flying. *Termite mounds are usually oriented in a north–south direction so that they absorb as much heat as possible around dawn and dusk and minimise heat absorption around noon. * Tuna are able to warm their entire bodies through a heat exchange mechanism called the rete mirabile, which helps keep heat inside the body, and minimises the loss of heat through the gills. They also have their swimming muscles near the center of their bodies instead of near the surface, which minimises heat loss. * Gigantothermy means growing to large size in order to reduce heat loss, such as in sea turtles and ice-age megafauna. Body volume increases proportionally faster than does body surface, with increasing size; and less body surface area per unit body volume tends to minimise heat loss. * Camels, although they are homeotherms, thermoregulate using a method termed \\"temperature cycling\\" to conserve energy. In hot deserts, they allow their body temperature to rise during the day and fall during the night, adjusting their body temperature to cycle over approximately 6 °C. Ecology It is comparatively easy for a poikilotherm to accumulate enough energy to reproduce. Poikilotherms at the same trophic level often have much shorter generations than homeotherms: weeks rather than years. Such applies even to animals with similar ecological roles such as cats and snakes. This difference in energy requirement also means that a given food source can support a greater density of poikilothermic animals than homeothermic animals.Steen, J.B, Steen, H. & Stenseth, N.C. (1991): Population Dynamics of Poikilotherm and Homeotherm Vertebrates: Effects of Food Shortage. OICOS Vol. 60, No 2 (March, 1991), pp 269-272. summary This is reflected in the predator- prey ratio which is usually higher in poikilothermic fauna compared to homeothermic ones. However, when homeotherms and poikilotherms have similar niches, and compete, the homeotherm can often drive poikilothermic competitors to extinction, because homeotherms can gather food for a greater fraction of each day. In medicine In medicine, loss of normal thermoregulation in humans is referred to as \\"poikilothermia\\". This is usually seen with sedative and hypnotic drugs or in 'compartment syndrome'. For example, barbiturates, ethanol, and chloral hydrate may precipitate this effect. REM sleep is also considered a poikilothermic state in humans.

In so doing, the chain bridge also spans the border between England and Scotland. When it opened in 1820 it was the longest wrought iron suspension bridge in the world with a span of , and the first vehicular bridge of its type in the United Kingdom. Although work started on the Menai Suspension Bridge first, the Union Bridge was completed earlier. Today it is the oldest suspension bridge still carrying road traffic and is a Category A listed building in Scotland and a Grade I listed building in England. It lies on Sustrans Route 1 and the Pennine Cycleway. History 1820 painting of the bridge by Alexander Nasmyth Latin: \\"United, Strength is Yet Stronger\\") Before the opening of the Union Bridge, crossing the river at this point involved an round trip via Berwick- upon-Tweed downstream or a trip via Coldstream upstream. (Ladykirk and Norham Bridge did not open until 1888.) The Tweed was forded in the vicinity of the bridge site, but the route was impassable during periods of high water. The Berwick and North Durham Turnpike Trust took on responsibility for improving matters by issuing a specification for a bridge. =Construction= The bridge was designed by an English Royal Navy officer, Captain Samuel Brown. Brown joined the Navy in 1795, and seeing the need for an improvement on the hemp ropes used, which frequently failed with resulting loss to shipping, he employed blacksmiths to create experimental wrought iron chains. was fitted with iron rigging in 1806, and in a test voyage proved successful enough that in 1808, with his cousin Samuel Lenox, he set up a company that would become Brown Lenox & Co. Brown left the Navy in 1812, and in 1813 he built a prototype suspension bridge of span, using of iron. It was sufficiently strong to support a carriage, and John Rennie and Thomas Telford reported favourably upon it. Brown took out a patent in 1816 for a method of manufacturing chains, followed by a patent titled Construction of a Bridge by the Formation and Uniting of its Component Parts in July 1817. In around 1817, Brown proposed a span bridge over the River Mersey at Runcorn, but this bridge was not built. It is not known why Brown became involved with the Union Bridge project, but agreed to take on the work based on a specification dated September 1818. Brown knew little of masonry, and Rennie did this aspect of the work. The bridge proposal received consent in July 1819, with the authority of an Act of Parliament that had been passed in 1802, and construction began on 2 August 1819. It opened on 26 July the following year, with an opening ceremony attended by the celebrated Scottish civil engineer Robert Stevenson among others. Captain Brown tested the bridge in a curricle towing twelve carts, before a crowd of about 700 spectators crossed. Until 1885, tolls were charged for crossing the bridge; the toll cottage, being at the English end, was demolished in 1955. =Later history= With the abolition of turnpike tolls in 1883, maintenance of the bridge passed to the Tweed Bridges Trust. When the Trust was wound up, the bridge became the responsibility of Scottish Borders Council and Northumberland County Council and it is now maintained by the County Council.Friends of the Union Chain Bridge website - History In addition to the 1902 addition of cables, the bridge has been strengthened and refurbished on many occasions. The bridge deck was substantially renewed in 1871, and again in 1974, with the chains reinforced at intervals throughout its life. The bridge was closed to motor vehicles for several months during 2007. A newspaper report available online (see external links) indicates that the closure happened shortly before 12 April 2007 and was due to one of the bridge hangers breaking. The affected hanger has temporarily been replaced with a threaded bar to allow the bridge to reopen to motor vehicles. In December 2008 the bridge was closed to traffic as a result of a landslide. In March 2013 the media reported a proposal to close the bridge because of a lack of funds to maintain it. In October 2014, it was reported that local enthusiasts and activists had started a campaign to have the bridge fully restored in time for its bicentenary in 2020.Bid to save Union Chain Bridge for bicentenary - The Scotsman In 2013, the bridge was placed on Historic England's Heritage at Risk register. =Restoration Project= In March 2017 Scottish Borders Council and Northumberland County Council agreed to contribute £550,000 each towards a restoration project that was then expected to cost £5 millon. Between then and August 2020 further pledges were made by both councils, the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Historic England. The work, now expected to cost £10.5 million, is to start in October 2020 and take around 18 months. Design Pier at the Scottish end The bridge has a single span of . It runs on an east-west alignment, with the western end in Scotland and the eastern end in England. At the Scottish end the road continues straight, but at the English end it turns sharply south.

He was arrested by the Nazis in 1943, accused of giving a lethal injection of phenol to an SS officer who was a potential witness in an investigation against Ilse Koch, with whom Hoven was rumoured to be having an affair. He was convicted and sentenced to death, although he was released in March 1945 due to the Nazi shortage of doctors.  Trial  Hoven was arrested at the end of World War II by the Allies and put on trial as a defendant at the Doctors' Trial, one of the Nuremberg Trials. He was found guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity and membership in a criminal organization. He was sentenced to death and hanged on 2 June 1948 at Landsberg prison in Bavaria.

Its extremely rich iconography and its visual components rank it among the most precious illuminated manuscripts of the second half of the 11th century in Europe. It was probably made at the order of Czech diplomats to honour an anniversary of the Czech King Vratislav's coronation which took place in 1085 (Vratislav was the first king of Bohemia, which was previously a dukedom). The codex is of Danubian provenance, and closely related to three other surviving manuscripts – two of them now in Poland and one in the Prague Chapter Library. They probably originated in the circle of the scriptorium at the Monastery of St. Emmeram in Regensburg.Information given to the European Library site by the Czech National Library includes image The manuscript is now located in the Czech National Library, Prague under the signature XIV A 13. In 2005 it was declared as a National cultural monument of the Czech Republic. The earliest known representation of the Tree of Jesse is in the book.Jean Anne Hayes Williams, The Earliest Dated Tree of Jesse Image: Thematically reconsidered. In a paper analysing this image, J.A. Hayes Williams points out that the iconography employed is very different from that usually found in such images, which she argues relates to an assertion of the rightful kingship of the royal patron. The page showing the Jesse Tree is accompanied by a number of other illuminated pages of which four depict the Ancestors of Christ. The Jesse Tree has not been used to support a number of figures, as is usual. Instead, the passage from Isaiah has been depicted in a very literal way. In the picture, the prophet Isaiah approaches Jesse from beneath whose feet is springing a tree, and wraps around him a banner with words upon it which translate literally as: \\"A little rod from Jesse gives rise to a splendid flower\\", following the language of the Vulgate. Instead of the ancestors seen in later depictions, seven doves (with haloes) perch in the branches. These, in a motif from Byzantine art, represent the Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit as described by the Apostle Paul.Epistle to the Romans, Chapter 12: verses 6-8. Williams go on to compare it with two other famous images, the Tree of Jesse window at Chartres Cathedral and the Lambeth Bible in England.

The score was revised in 1949. Stravinsky designed the Capriccio to be a virtuosic vehicle which would allow him to earn a living from playing the piano part. The Capriccio, together with the Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments, belonged to a catalogue of breadwinning pieces which Stravinsky composed to support himself after fleeing the Russian Revolution to live in Western Europe. History The Allegro capriccioso movement that would become the finale was begun first, in Nice on Christmas Day 1928, and provided the musical material from which the other movements grew. It was followed by the second movement, completed at Echarvines on 13 September 1929, and then by the opening Presto. The orchestration of the first movement was completed on 26 October and that of the last movement on 9 November 1929 . The premiere took place in the Salle Pleyel, Paris, on 6 December 1929, with the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris conducted by Ernest Ansermet (who had founded the orchestra that winter season) and featuring the composer at the piano . The next year, Stravinsky made a commercial recording of the work as soloist, with the Straram Orchestra, conducted by Ernest Ansermet . Beginning in the mind-1930s, Stravinsky's son Soulima often performed as soloist, most often with his father conducting . In 1949 Stravinsky corrected a number of misprints and omissions in the score, and this version was published in 1952. Unfortunately, a few new mistakes were added in this new edition, the most important of which was a change of the tempo marking at rehearsal number 14 from the original dotted-quaver = 88 to 80, which contradicts the specification that the semiquavers remain the same . Amongst other influences on the Capriccio, Stravinsky very much had in mind Carl Maria von Weber, whom he described as \\"a prince of music\\" . The three movements are played attacca (without interruption) and take just under twenty minutes to perform. Instrumentation The Capriccio is scored for solo piano, pairs of woodwinds (flutes doubling piccolo, oboes, clarinets doubling piccolo clarinet, and bassoons), cor anglais, four horns, three trombones, tuba, strings and timpani. In addition to the solo piano, there is a concertino group of soloists consisting of the first violinist, first violist, first cellist and first bassist. Ballet productions The score was first used as ballet music when Léonide Massine choreographed it in 1947 for the Teatro alla Scala, Milan. The décor for this production was by Nicola Benois. A second production was created in 1957 with choreography, décor, and costumes by Alan Carter . The original 1929 version of the Capriccio was used by George Balanchine as the score for the \\"Rubies\\" section of his full-length 1967 ballet Jewels .

The name is also that of a neighbouring village in the Nile Valley, whence the site takes its name. Abusir is located several kilometres north of Saqqara and, like it, served as one of the main elite cemeteries for the ancient Egyptian capital city of Memphis. Several other villages in northern and southern Egypt are named Abusir or Busiri. Abusir is one relatively small segment of the extensive \\"pyramid field\\" that extends from north of Giza to below Saqqara. The locality of Abusir took its turn as the focus of the prestigious western burial rites operating out of the then-capital of Memphis during the Old Kingdom 5th Dynasty. As an elite cemetery, neighbouring Giza had by then \\"filled up\\" with the massive pyramids and other monuments of the 4th Dynasty, leading the 5th Dynasty pharaohs to seek sites elsewhere for their own funerary monuments. Abusir was the origin of the largest find of Old Kingdom papyri to date -- the Abusir Papyri. In the late nineteenth century, a number of Western museums acquired collections of fragmentary papyri from the administrative (temple) records of one Abusir funerary cult, that of king Neferirkare Kakai. This discovery was supplemented in the late twentieth century when excavations by a Czech expedition to the site revealed papyri from two other cult complexes, that of the pharaoh Neferefre (also read Raneferef) and for the king's mother Khentkaus II. The Czech Institute of Egyptology of the Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague has been conducting excavations at Abusir since 1976. They are presently directed by Miroslav Bárta. There are considerable catacombs near the ancient town of Busiris (Pliny xxxvi. 12. s. 16). To the south of Busiris one great cemetery appears to have stretched over the plain. The Heptanomite Busiris was in fact a hamlet standing at one extremity of the necropolis of Memphis. Necropolis Abusir necropolis Abusir, pyramids There are a total of 14 pyramids at this site, which served as the main royal necropolis during the Fifth Dynasty. The quality of construction of the Abusir pyramids is inferior to those of the Fourth Dynasty; perhaps signalling a decrease in royal power or a less vibrant economy. They are smaller than their predecessors, and are built of low quality local stone. All of the major pyramids at Abusir were built as step pyramids, although the largest of them -- the Pyramid of Neferirkare -- is believed to have originally been built as a step pyramid some seventy metres in height and then later transformed into a \\"true\\" pyramid by having its steps filled in with loose masonry. =Major pyramids= The three major pyramids are * the Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai, the tallest pyramid at the site * the Pyramid of Niuserre, the most intact pyramid at the site * the Pyramid of Sahure known for its finely carved reliefs =Smaller pyramids= * the incomplete Pyramid of Neferefre * the pyramid of Queen Khentkaus II, wife of Neferirkare and mother of Neferefre and Niuserre * the unfinished pyramid of Shepseskare? * Lepsius Pyramid no. 24 -- The pyramid belonged to a woman, likely a queen.

The temple lies about 500 meters south east of the pyramids, close to the cultivation in the desert. The main building of the temple was built of limestone. There were three cellars, a small hall with four columns and a courtyard (with mudbrick walls) with ten limestone columns. The limestone building was placed within a larger complex made of mud bricks with a pylon and magazines.M. Barta, L. Varadzin, J. Janák, J. Mynářová, V.

Biography Born in Usigni in Umbria, as a young man he went to Rome and was soon noticed by Maffeo Barberini, a cleric of the Apostolic Chamber and a fellow Umbrian from nearby Spoleto, soon to become Pope under the name of Urban VIII. In 1632 he was made Majordomo and Prefect of the Lateran palace, in which posts he was responsible for supervising church and court ceremonies. On 25 Jul 1633, he was consecrated Titular Archbishop of Amasia in partibus by Antonio Marcello Barberini (seniore), Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Onofrio, with Giovanni della Robbia, Bishop of Bertinoro, and Benedetto Landi, Bishop Emeritus of Fossombrone, serving as co-consecrators. As private secretary to Pope Urban, among his most valuable services was that of purchasing old works of art, or commissioning new works, for that inveterate collector; among the artists he encouraged was Claude Lorrain. He was rewarded toward the end of Urban's pontificate by being raised to the purple as Cardinal-Priest of San Crisogono on 31 August 1643. He was appointed Bishop of Orvieto in 1644. He participated in the Papal conclave of 1644 which elected Urban's successor, Pope Innocent X. Saint Rita Throughout his life, he remained very devoted to his home town and region. In addition to beautifying Usigni, he was instrumental in developing iron mines in the area, and he was also so greatly devoted to Rita of Cascia (beatified by Urban in 1627), adorning her church in that town and promoting her cult, that he is often considered to have been the main force in establishing her present cult and popularity. The second edition (1652) of Girolamo de Ghetti's Breve Racconto della Vita e Miracoli della B. Rita da Cascia is dedicated to him. Death and burial Poli died in Orvieto in 1653; he was buried according to his wishes in the Chapel of the Guardian Angel in his titular church of San Crisogono.

Nevertheless, the city was able to keep its main industries on track. Large chemical plants such as titanium and sodium factories as well as several huge Potassium, Magnesium and Potash mines are operational in Berezniki. The potash mine, owned by Uralkali, was the basis of the fortune of Dmitry Rybolovlev who sold his interest in 2010 to Suleyman Kerimov. Mine supports in the huge underground mine, about 1,000 feet (~300 metres) beneath the city, consist of soluble salt which is being dissolved by water flooding into the mine. The city, a former Soviet era labor camp, was built near the work site, over the mine. Several sinkholes, some huge, have opened within the city. The situation requires round-the-clock monitoring. The problem is believed to be limited to a small part of the mine which was not filled properly and to be limited in its future impact, but relocation of the city is under consideration.\\"A Russian City Always on the Watch Against Being Sucked Into the Earth\\" article by Andrew E.

In 2009 its population was 14,400. 2009 statistics of Belarus (Belstat) History According to chronicles, Zaslawye was founded in 985 by Vladimir the Great who sent his wife Rogneda to live here with their son Izyaslav of Polotsk, the founder of the princely house of Polatsk. It is mentioned in historical writings as Izyaslavl. The town's current name derives from this name. In the early Middle Ages, the town was the centre of the Principality of Izyaslavl. In the 11th century, the town was heavily fortified; much of its territory has been designated an archaeological reservation. There is also a modern outdoor statue of Rogneda and Izyaslav on the grounds. During the period of Reformation, the town was a nest for followers of Calvinism and Socinianism. The town became a part of the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire after the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. Soviet power was established in November 1917. German occupation lasted from February to December 1918. In 1919, the town became a part of the Byelorussian SSR. Polish occupation lasted from July 1919 to July 1920. This district center was under German occupation from 28 June 1941 to 4 July 1944. In 1939, Jews comprised 9% of the town’s total population, numbering 248 people. In October 1941, the Germans gathered 100 Jews of the city in a ghetto which was a building formerly occupied by Soviet border guards. It was forbidden to go outside and they didn’t received food. The ghetto was surrounded by a fence and was supervised day and night. On September 26 and 27, 1941, all the Jewish males were killed, at least 20 people in total, 12 of them burned in the ghetto building. On September 29, around 100 Jews, mostly women, children, and elderly people, were taken on horse carts out of the ghetto under the pretext of future resettlement to Minsk. They were all shot in a pit in the forest near the village of Sloboda. For a month following the liquidation of the ghetto, 35 Jewish women were kept in one of the houses on Bazarnaya Street. They were used for different kinds of forced labor until they were all shot on October 29, 1941.http://yahadmap.org/#village/zaslavl- minsk-belarus.494 Geography Situated in north-western suburb of Minsk, is part of its urban area and one of its main towns also with Fanipol and Machulishi.

Species of Macrocarpaea have diurnal and nocturnal pollinators, visited during the day by hummingbirds, insects and butterflies, and at night by bats, moths and many different kinds of insects. The common name for the genus is 'Moon-gentian'. No species are known in cultivation. Characteristics Species of this genus have white, cream, yellow to green flowers. Most have a large, open campanulate to funnel-form corolla adapted to nocturnal bat pollination. This genus is one of the few of the gentian family that have species with hairs on their leaves. Distribution Macrocarpaea has a relatively broad distribution in mountainous regions of the Neotropics. The Neotropics comprise the tropical parts of the New World in Mesoamerica and South America. The gentian tribe Helieae, to which Macrocarpaea belongs is restricted to the Neotropics. The overall distribution pattern of Macrocarpaea is typical of many Neotropical taxa. The genus is basically found in five major geographic regions: the Andes [ranging from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, to Bolivia] (85 species), southern Mesoamerica [Costa Rica and Panama] (6 species), the Greater Antilles of the Caribbean [Cuba, Dominican Republic, Jamaica] (3 species), the Pantepui of the Guayana Shield [Venezuela, and adjacent regions in Brazil and Guyana] (6 species), and southeastern Brazil (5 species).

It told the story of an alien culture in a manner that contained a blend of science fiction with details of Earth-like ancient civilizations, the most obvious being ancient Rome. Background The series initially ran from 1965 to 1982, dealing with the long-past events of an empire on the distant planet of Elekton. Heavily influenced by mythological tales, a number of the societies seemed to be based on ancient cultures that had existed in history. Chief among these was the Trigan Empire, apparently modelled on Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. This similarity even extended to Trigan City, the capital being built on five hills, in a similar fashion to the seven hills of Rome. The Trigans flew atmosphere craft. The Trigans' clothing was similar to that of the Romans, with many of the populace dressed in toga-like garments, or in the case of the soldiery, in Greek or Roman-style armour. A similar likeness could be drawn with Hericon, the chief rival in power to the Trigans, whose appearance seemed to mirror that of elements of the Byzantine Empire, and the Persian Empire. According to Butterworth, \\"The original Impetus was from that veritable genius Leonard Matthews, then my senior group editor when I was editing \\"Sun” and “Comet\\". He threw the first introductory script at me and told me to take it from there. He had no idea where to further it but he knew where to look for a guy who did....\\" The first strip told of a spaceship crashing into a swamp on Earth, the crew frozen to death, with many written volumes inside in an unknown language. Studies of the crew reveal them to be humanoid, but around 12 feet tall. After many years, the spaceship is turned into the central attraction of an amusement park. Eventually, at a very advanced age, a scientist—Peter Richard Haddon—who has studied the books from the spaceship as a young man manages to translate the volumes, and begins to relate the tales. The Trigans began as a nomadic tribe called the Vorgs, with no technology, initially under the leadership of three brothers, Trigo, Brag and Klud. Trigo persuades his more conservative brothers that in the face of changing events, namely the ambitions of the Lokan Empire, they must settle. The fledgling Trigan nation is established via a merger of the nomadic Vorgs and the technically advanced people of Tharv (who arrived as refugees to the Plains of Vorg after they were defeated by the Lokans) under the leadership of Trigo, with the trappings of a Romanesque civilization with swords, lances and Roman-style clothing, but with high-tech ray guns, aircraft and a high-tech navy. In a later story, the Trigans create a rocketship in months to fly to one of Elekton's moons. Several of the other civilizations show a similar blend of low and high tech. Publication history The strip first appeared in the first issue of the British magazine Ranger in September 1965 and then in the British Look and Learn magazine from issue 232 (June 1966) when the two titles merged after the 40th issue of Ranger. Both titles were weekly educational magazines designed for children; although mainly filled with educational features on life, history, science and technology, both contained a small comic strip section in each issue. Unusually for a British comic, the strip was printed in colour. The series ran in Look and Learn until the title ceased publication with issue 1049, in April 1982, comprising a run of 854 issues in total, divided between the two magazines. In addition to the weekly strips, a very small number of Trigan Empire stories were published in Ranger annuals and a Vulcan summer special.http://bearalley.blogspot.nl/2007/06/writers-of-trigan-empire.html In 1975-1976, the series thus far was reprinted in its original sequential order, in Vulcan, a weekly glossy-format comic, which reprinted the strips in full colour, albeit edited and resized, alongside colour reprints of other British comics serials of the 1960s.http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2014/06/vulcan-1975.html There were a number of reprints in hardback format. In 1978, Hamlyn Publishing in the United Kingdom printed a hardback collection of early Trigan Empire stories titled simply The Trigan Empire; this was reprinted in the United States by Chartwell Publishing. A later collection, also in hardback, was printed by Hawk Publishing in 1989 as Tales of the Trigan Empire. Both the Hamlyn and the Hawk books presented edited versions of the stories; most notably, in the Hawk book there are sometimes entire pages that have been left out. Several stories were repeated in both collections, but The Trigan Empire collection has the earliest, showing the establishment of the Empire. In 2004-2008, the stories drawn by Don Lawrence were reprinted by the Don Lawrence Collection in luxury hardback limited editions. These editions contain the complete stories, without any of the omissions that were a feature of the earlier reprints, particularly the Hawk Publishing book. They were not reprinted from Look and Learn; in many cases they were printed from the original artwork, and used revised fonts to make the text easier to read. The rights to The Trigan Empire were bought by Rebellion Developments in 2018.Down the Tubes: British Comic Heroes Under One Roof! Rebellion Snaps up TI Media's Classic Comics Catalogue They intend publishing the sequence drawn by Lawrence in four volumes with a first volume appearing in March 2020.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat- vision/trigan-empire-comic-book-be-reissued-1211893 Main characters Trigo - Trigo is the founder of the Empire. With his two brothers Brag and Klud, he was the leader of a tribe of Vorgs. At this time the Lokan Empire was instituting a military buildup with an intent to take over the entire planet. Trigo had a vision of a nation where the Vorg tribesmen could give up their nomadic existence and band together in civilization. He knew that the Lokans were intent on conquest and felt that if the Vorgs were not united they would become extinct. When his initial plans to build a city on the plains of Vorg fail, there is a fateful meeting with refugees from the nation of Tharv which has been attacked by Loka. Among these refugees is the architect Peric who agrees to help Trigo with his plans as long as his people are allowed to stay there. Although Brag was willing to give up his claims of leadership to his people to allow Trigo to become sole ruler, his brother Klud had no such plan and tried to assassinate Trigo. In the years to come, Trigo will institute a treaty with Hericon, the other great power on the planet of Elekton, be crowned first Emperor of the Trigan Empire, and face many other threats to himself and his empire. Brag - Trigo's brother. While some consider him slow and perhaps a bit stupid, Brag is well-meaning and ever faithful to his brother. Despite living in relative luxury with all the benefits of more advanced technology there are times that Brag wishes he was back to his life as a simple Vorg huntsman. He keeps himself in good physical shape despite growing older. If Brag can be classed as having a fault, it is that he can be manipulated by those cleverer than himself. Janno - Janno is the son of Brag and nephew to Emperor Trigo. A courageous individual, he has a natural aptitude as an atmosphere craft pilot. He is friends with Keren, the son of Chief Imbala of Daveli, and Roffa from the City State of Ellul. Janno is regularly a representative of Trigan City, whether it is as an athlete in the olympic style games, or as a diplomatic envoy. In some stories it is mentioned in a short dialogue that Trigo had a thought to name him his successor. Peric - Chief architect of the destroyed nation of Tharv, Peric with his daughter and other Tharvish refugees made their way into the desert of Vorg after the destruction of the main city of Tharv by Lokan forces. Peric is of advanced years but remains fairly healthy. He is regarded as the greatest living architect on Elekton and an accomplished engineer and scientist. He is often behind many of the great accomplishments of the Empire. Salvia - Salvia is the daughter of Peric and is the most visible female character in the series. Salvia is skilled in Tharvish medicine, a trait that would serve the Empire well on a number of occasions, whether it is saving Trigo from potent poison inflicted by Trigo's brother, or the life of Keren, son of Chief Imbala of Daveli, or the life of the Chieftainess of the Tamaz desert warriors. Keren - Janno's best friend and son of Chief Imbala of Daveli whose culture closely mirrors that of Central American Indian civilisations. Keren was introduced in the second tale of the series, \\"Crash in the Jungle\\". Keren and his people are shown as being either blue skinned or dark green, depending on the printing. Lady Ursa - Sister of King Kassar of Hericon and probably the next most visible female character of the series. She and Trigo were married, as guarantee for the ratification of a trade treaty, at the start of the story titled \\"War With Hericon\\". They would have triple sons, although two would later be killed. King Zorth - The autocratic, megalomaniacal, despotic and tyrannical leader of Loka whose obsession with planet conquest (especially that of the Trigan Empire) ended only when he was overthrown by his own people. The Lokans are given an olive complexion and appear somewhat Asiatic.

Career Szőke was born in Budapest.Enciclopedia del calcio In 1949 he moved to Italy under contract to Fanfulla before becoming a well-known name in Italian football by being transferred to first division Udinese who went on to place themselves in second position, behind the great AC Milan, in the Serie A division during the 1955–56 season. Szőke had a spell in Colombia with Atlético Junior during the 1951 season. Subsequently he transferred to Triestina and with them he won the Italian serie B championship in 1957/58. At the end of the 1960 season he was ceded to Brescia, coached at the time by another Hungarian born personage in György Sárosi, only to return to Trieste at the end of that season. With the Triestina team, now in Serie B, he became one of the squad's focal points, winning the 1961/62 premiership, returning immediately to Serie B where he ended his playing days in 1963 after suffering a serious leg injury. He remained in the Udine area, and died in hospital in that city on 19 March 2014, at the age of 83.

The 2004 parish population, including the hamlet of Nounsley, was approximately 5,500. Hatfield means a 'heathery space in the forest'; Peverel refers to William Peverel, the Norman knight granted lands in the area by William the Conqueror after the Norman invasion of 1066. Sited on high ground east of the River Ter, between Boreham and Witham on the A12, it is situated in the southern extremity of the Braintree District Council area (to which it elects two members). Hatfield Peverel is 6 miles (10 km) northeast from Chelmsford, the nearest large town, to which it is connected by road and rail. Hatfield Peverel railway station is on the Abellio Greater Anglia East Anglia rail network, connecting it to London and Colchester Hatfield Peverel is the site of a priory founded by the Saxon Ingelrica, wife of Ranulph Peverel and reputed to be the mistress of William the Conqueror, to atone for her sins, and dissolved by Henry VIII. The parish church, St Andrew's (Church of England) is the surviving fragment of the Norman priory church nave. There is also a Methodist Church and a Salvation Army (northeast London headquarters) congregation. The village has a Junior School (St Andrew's C of E) and an adjacent County Infant School, and Scout and Guide organisations with headquarters in Church Road, a post office, library, and doctors' surgery. Hatfield Peverel was the site of an Arla Foods factory which closed in July 2016, it used to produce dairy products, and other small business concerns. The factory which has subsequently been demolished and there are plans to build up to 177 houses on the former site. There are six public houses, a farm shop and other retail outlets. Major houses include Berwick Place, Crix, Hatfield Place, Hatfield Wick, and The Priory. Hatfield Peverel Station is seen in the 1976 film Exposé starring Linda Hayden and Fiona Richmond.

The club are now based on the outskirts of the village at a former gravel pit at Wickham Bishops Road and fields men's, ladies and junior teams. Agnes Waterhouse Hatfield Peverel was the home of Agnes Waterhouse, the first woman to be executed for witchcraft in England. Known locally as Mother Waterhouse, and she confessed to witchcraft in 1566, and two other women were also accused of witchcraft at the same time: Elizabeth Francis and Joan Waterhouse (Agnes' daughter).http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/agnes- waterhouse-first-woman-executed-witchcraft-england-005747 Her trial took place in Chelmsford, where she was found guilty and executed for using witchcraft to disease and cause the death of William Fynne. Elizabeth admitted to having a familiar - a cat called Satan, who she fed drops of her blood and it helped to kill people, terminate pregnancies and stole cattle. She sold the cat to Agnes in exchange for cake, and both Agnes and Joan tested the cat's abilities. Joan is said to have had the cat turn into a toad, and when a child refused to give Joan food, Satan offered to help Joan in exchange for her soul, which she agreed to. The toad was said to have harassed the child and threatened her with death, and eventually the child asked Satan who its 'dame' was, and it answered Agnes Waterhouse, leading her to be accused of witchcraft by the child. Waterhouse was executed two days after the trial based on the evidence and word of the child.https://historywitch.com/tag/agnes-waterhouse/ ReferencesExternal links * Hatfield Peverel Online * Hatfield Peverel * http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/hatfieldpeverelfc Category:Villages in Essex Category:Civil parishes in Essex Category:Braintree District ","title":"Hatfield Peverel"},{"id":"2008767","text":"Levanger-Avisa is a regional newspaper in Norway.

He has been described by scholars and anti- racism activists as antisemitic and a Holocaust denier. Early life Atzmon was born in a secular Jewish family in Tel Aviv, Israel and grew up in Jerusalem. Atzmon first became interested in the British variety of jazz when he came across some recordings of it in a British record shop in Jerusalem in the 1970s, and found inspiration in the work of Ronnie Scott and Tubby Hayes and regarded London as \\"the Mecca of Jazz.\\" However, at 17, while readying himself for induction into the army, he happened to hear a radio broadcast of a recording of Charlie Parker's With Strings and was swept off his feet. Atzmon has said of the album that he \\"loved the way the music is both beautiful and subversive – the way he basks in the strings but also fights against them.\\"John Lewis \\"Manic beat preacher\\", The Guardian, 6 March 2009 According to Atzmon, he skipped school to visit Jerusalem's Piccadilly Records outlet, and bought up every Bebop recording they stocked. Two days later, he purchased a saxophone. According to Atzmon, he was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in June 1981, first serving as a combat medic and participated in the 1982 Lebanon War. According to Aztmon, he was transferred to a position within the Israel Defense Forces Orchestra and spent most of his military service in the Israeli Air Force orchestra. After he was demobilised, Atzmon says he travelled to Europe in December 1984, living as a busker. Musical careerEarly years= In the following years, he trained at the Rubin Academy of Music in Jerusalem. During the late 1980s and 1990s Atzmon was a popular session musician and producer, recording extensively and performing with Israeli artists such as: Yehuda Poliker, Yardena Arazi, Si Himan, Meir Banai and Ofra Haza. Additionally, he started the first incarnation of the \\"Gilad Atzmon Quartet\\" and a group named \\"Spiel Acid Jazz Band\\" with fellow Israeli Jazz musicians, and performed regularly at the Red Sea Jazz Festival. In 1994, Atzmon planned on studying abroad in the United States but ended up in England, attending the University of EssexUniversity of Essex news release dated 14 December 2007 notes Atzmon is a \\"graduate\\" , Essex.ac.uk; accessed 27 February 2016. and earning a master's degree in Philosophy, according to CounterPunch. He has lived subsequently in the UK, becoming a British citizen in 2002, according to CounterPunch and renouncing his Israeli citizenship.Karen Abi-Ezzi, 'Music as a Discourse of Resistance: The Case of Gilad Atzmon,' in Olivier Urbain (ed.), Music and Conflict Transformation: Harmonies and Dissonances in Geopolitics, I. B. Tauris, 2015 pp.93–103, p. 93 =Instruments and style= While Atzmon's main instrument is the alto saxophone, he also plays soprano, tenor and baritone saxophones and clarinet, sol, zurna and flute. Atzmon told The Guardian that he draws on Arabic music which he says cannot be notated like western music but must be internalised, which he calls \\"reverting to the primacy of the ear\\". Atzmon's musical method has been to play with notions of cultural identity, flirting with genres such as tango and klezmer as well as various Arabic, Balkan, Gypsy and Ladino folk forms. Atzmon's recordings deliberately differ from his live shows. \\"I don't think that anyone can sit in a house, at home, and listen to me play a full-on bebop solo. It's too intense. My albums need to be less manic.\\" =Collaborations and groups= Atzmon joined the veteran punk rock band Ian Dury and the Blockheads in 1998, and continued with the Blockheads after Dury's death.Stephen Robb, \\"The old Blockheads shows go on\\", BBC News, 25 January 2007.Sara Greek, Blockheads come to Hertford Corn Exchange , Hertfordshire Mercury, 28 October 2011. He has recorded two albums with Robert Wyatt, who describes him as \\"one of the few musical geniuses I've ever met\\". Atzmon founded the Orient House Ensemble band in London in 2000 with Asaf Sirkis on drums, Frank Harrison on piano and Oli Hayhurst on bass. In 2003 Yaron Stavi replaced Hayhurst. In 2009 Eddie Hick replaced Sirkis.John Fordham, Asaf Sirkis Trio: Letting Go – review, The Guardian, 14 October 2010. The group was named after Orient House, the former East Jerusalem headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The band has recorded eight albums. Orient House announced a 40-date tour in 2010.John Fordham, Gilad Atzmon Orient House Ensemble – review, The Guardian, 5 October 2010. Robert Wyatt, who has said that Atzmon combines \\"great artistry with a sense of the intrinsically non-racialist philosophy that's implicit in jazz,\\"Lester Paul \\"So who is top of the pops\\", The Guardian, 26 June 2010. worked with Atzmon and others on his album Comicopera (2007).Chris Jones, A national treasure makes another peerless album, BBC, 5 October 2007.

In 2014, Atzmon performed on The Endless River, the last album of Pink Floyd. Atzmon is on the creative panel of the Global Music Foundation, a non-profit organization formed in December 2004 which runs residential educational and performance workshops and events in different countries around the world. A musical transcription of ten saxophone solos by Atzmon was released in 2010.Chris Gumbley, Gilad Uncovered: 10 Transcriptions, Gumbles Publications, 2010. According to reviewer Chris Searle in 2010, writing in the Morning Star, \\"No jazz musicians have done more to honour, publicise and spread solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinians than Atzmon and the Orient House Ensemble.”Chris Searle, Review of the book Jazz Jews by Mike Gerber , Morning Star, February 2010. =Reviews and awards= Atzmon and his ensemble have received favourable reviews from the Financial Times, The Scotsman, and the Birmingham Post. Reviews of his 2007 album Refuge included: :Manchester Evening News: \\"The individuality of the music is extraordinary. No one is more willing to serve his music with raw political passion, and that curious cantor-like tone on clarinet is immediately arresting, like Artie Shaw writhing in his death throes.\\"Alan Brownlee, Gilad Atzmon & The Orient House Ensemble – Refuge (Enja), Manchester Evening News, 30 August 2007. :BBC: \\"...the OHE is finding its voice in an increasingly subtle blend of East and West, that’s brutal and beautiful.\\"Kathryn Shackleton, Gilad Atzmon & The Orient House Ensemble, Refuge, BBC, 1 October 2007. In February 2009, The Guardian jazz critic John Fordham reviewed Atzmon's newest album In loving memory of America which was described by Atzmon as \\"a memory of America I had cherished in my mind for many years\\". It includes five standards and six originals \\"inspired by the sumptuous harmonies and impassioned sax-playing of (Charlie) Parker's late-40s recordings with classical strings\\".John Fordham, \\"Gilad Atzmon: In Loving Memory of America\\", The Guardian, 27 February 2009. While music journalist John Lewis has praised much of Atzmon's work, he notes that \\"trenchant politics often sit uneasily alongside music, particularly when that music is instrumental\\". In a 2009 profile in The Guardian, Lewis criticised his 2006 comedy klezmer project, Artie Fishel and the Promised Band, as \\"a clumsy satire on what he regards as the artificial nature of Jewish identity politics.\\" While Lewis described Atzmon as \\"one of London's finest saxophonists\\", he observed that: \\"It is Atzmon's blunt anti-Zionism rather than his music that has given him an international profile, particularly in the Arab world, where his essays are widely read.\\" Atzmon's Exile was BBC jazz album of the year in 2003.Jazz winners span generations, BBC, 30 July 2003. WritingsViews= Atzmon has defined himself variously as \\"not a Jew anymore. I indeed despise the Jew in me (whatever is left)\\", a \\"proud self- hating Jew\\" in the style of Otto Weininger,Theo Panayides, 'Wandering jazz player,', Cyprus Mail, 21 February 2010: \\"My ethical duty is to say the things that I know and feel. I’m an artist. Do you know.. this is something I learned from Otto Weininger, the Austrian philosopher. He was a clever boy, killed himself when he was 21. ..He was definitely a proud self-hating Jew! I’m not a self-hating Jew: I’m a proud self-hating Jew! It’s a big difference… I celebrate my hatred towards everything I represent – or better to say [everything] I’m associated with\\". \\"a Jew who hates Judaism\\", and as \\"a Hebrew-speaking Palestinian\\". He has said: \\"I don't write about politics, I write about ethics. I write about Identity. I write a lot about the Jewish Question – because I was born in the Jew-land, and my whole process in maturing into an adult was involved with the realisation that my people are living on stolen land\\".Theo Panayides, 'Wandering jazz player,', Cyprus Mail, 21 February 2010. Atzmon has said that his experience in the military of \\"my people destroying other people left a big scar\\" and led to his decision that he was deluded about Zionism. Atzmon has compared \\"the Jewish Ideology\\" to that of the Nazis and has described Israel's policy toward the Palestinians as genocide. He has condemned \\"Jewishness\\" as \\"very much a supremacist, racist tendency\\", but has also stated that \\"I don't have anything against Jews in particular and you won't find that in my writings\\". Regarding the one-state solution, Atzmon concedes that such a state probably would be controlled by Islamists, but says, \\"That's their business\\". =Periodicals= Atzmon has written for CounterPunch and The Palestine Chronicle.Examples of Gilad Atzmon in CounterPunch:Vengeance, Barbarism and Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, 18 September 2009; Collective Self-Deception: The Most Common Mistakes of Israelis, 28 August 2003; The Left and Islam: Thinking Outside of the Secular Box, 10–12 July 2009. In 2009, he wrote for and edited the website, Palestine Think Tank. =Books= Atzmon's A Guide to the Perplexed, published in 2001, is set in a 2052 in which Israel has been replaced by a Palestinian state. Jeffrey St. Clair in CounterPunch describes it as \\"vividly written satire, infused with a ribald sense of humor and an unsparing critique of the incendiary political cauldron of the Mideast\\". It largely reviews memoirs of the alienated Israeli Gunther Wunker's rise to fame as a \\"peepologist\\", or voyeur. The perplexed are defined as \\"the unthinking Chosen\\" who \\"cling to clods of earth that don't belong to them\\". The novel excoriates what it describes as the commercialization of the Holocaust and \\"argues that the Holocaust is invoked as a kind of reflexive propaganda designed to shield the Zionist state from responsibility for any transgression against Palestinians\\".Jeffrey St. Clair,'Gilad Atzmon's \\"A Guide to the Perplexed\\",' CounterPunch 17 July 2003 Matthew J. Reisz, a reviewer for The Independent, wrote that \\"As a viciously black satire on Israeli life\\" the book \\"is grandiose, childish and nasty, but with just enough connection with reality to give it a certain unsettling power\\". Darren King in The Observer noted of this \\"provocative debut novel\\" that it is \\"odd to mix knob gags with highly serious assertions\\", but thought it works because \\"Atzmon writes with so much style and his gags are so hilarious\\". Atzmon's second novel, My One and Only Love, was published in 2005 and features as a protagonist a trumpeter who chooses to play only one note (extremely well), as well as a spy who uncovers Nazi war criminals and locks them inside double bass cases which then tour permanently in the protagonist's orchestra's luggage.Sholto Byrnes. \\"Talking Jazz\\", The Independent, 25 March 2005 The book is also a comedic take on \\"Zionist espionage and intrigue\\" which explores \\"the personal conflict between being true to one’s heart and being loyal to The Jews\\".\\"Gilad Atzmon's Orient House Ensemble – The Junction\\", BBC Cambridgeshire, 3 June 2005. By 2009, his two comic novels had been published in 24 languages. Atzmon's 2015 book, A to Zion: The Definitive Israeli Lexicon, was summarised by Eugene Schulman in CounterPunch as \\"designed to alphabetically define certain aspects of Zionism and Zionist personalities in one-liner jabs\\" and said it would \\"knock a hole in all your prejudices\\". Atzmon's fifth book, Being in Time: A Post-Political Manifesto, published in 2017, was described by James Petras as \\"a brilliant and substantive critique of identity politics and Jewish political ideology and culture\\" and as \\"an essential read for understanding and confronting authoritarianism of all stripes and colours\\". Keith Kahn-Harris, in an opinion piece, argued that its critique of identity politics and ascription of it to Jewishness was inherently antisemitic. The Wandering Who? In 2011, Zero Books published Atzmon's book, The Wandering Who? A Study of Jewish Identity Politics, stating that it \\"examines Jewish identity politics and Jewish contemporary ideology using both popular culture and scholarly texts\\".Gilad Atzmon, The Wandering Who? A Study of Jewish Identity Politics, Zero Books, 2011. Marc H. Ellis likens Atzmon's rhetorical extremism and harsh censure of Jews to the prophetic voices of the Old Testament, arguing that, for Atzmon, diasporic Jews are asked to construct their identity on the basis of the State of Israel and the Holocaust, an identity he regards as without foundation. He adds that Atzmon considers charges that he is antisemitic as 'last ditch attempts' to validate that identity. In Ellis's view, there may be, in the perceived anxiety in these repeated attacks, a reflection of the same anxiety Atzmon himself arguably embodies.Marc H. Ellis, Future of the Prophetic: Israel's Ancient Wisdom Re-presented, Fortress Press, 2014 pp.331–332. In The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg described Atzmon as \\"jazz saxophonist who lives in London and who has a side gig disseminating the wildest sort of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories\\", and described several instances of Holocaust denial and antisemitic discourse by Atzmon including: describing the Holocaust as \\"the new Western religion\\", that Hitler was persecuted by Jews, and that Jews traffic in body parts. Goldberg notes that even Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions activists have repudiated him. According to Goldberg, Atzmon in the book calls for renewed scholarship into the veracity of long-rejected medieval blood libels. According to Alan Dershowitz in The New Republic, at least ten authors associated with the publisher called on it to distance itself from Atzmon’s views, asserting that the “thrust of Atzmon’s work is to normalise and legitimise anti- Semitism\\".Alan Dershowitz, \\"Why are John Mearsheimer and Richard Falk Endorsing a Blatantly Anti-Semitic Book?\\", The New Republic, 4 November 2011. Allegations of antisemitismTimeline= In 2003 Atzmon wrote that: \\"We must begin to take the accusation that the Jewish people are trying to control the world very seriously\\", the blog post was subsequently amended with \\"Zionists\\" replacing \\"the Jewish people\\" in the original post. Also in 2003, Atzmon wrote that attacks on synagogues and Jewish graves, while not legitimate, should be seen as \\"political responses\\". In April 2005, Atzmon said in a talk with SOAS university students that \\"I'm not going to say whether it is right or not to burn down a synagogue, I can see that it is a rational act\\".Curtis, Polly. \\"SOAS faces action over alleged anti-semitism\\", The Guardian, 12 May 2005. Atzmon responded that he was quoted inaccurately and out of context and did not mean to justify violence, but that since Israel presents itself as the \\"state of the Jewish people\\" the \\"any form of anti- Jewish activity may be seen as political retaliation.\\" In a 2005 opinion piece, David Aaronovitch criticised Atzmon for his essay \\"On Anti-Semitism\\" and for circulating an article promoting Holocaust denial. In June, members of the Jews Against Zionism (JAZ) group protested in front of a London bookshop against an appearance by Atzmon who was criticised by JAZ for circulating a Paul Eisen work that defended Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel. In a 2006 opinion piece, David Hirsh criticised what he called Atzmon's \\"openly anti-Jewish rhetoric\\", including Jewish deicide.Hirsh, David. Openly embracing prejudice, The Guardian, 30 November 2006. Hirsh also refers to the statement in \\"What charge?\\", \\"The Guardian\\", 3 April 2006. In response to a question about this Atzmon replied, in CounterPunch, \\"I find it astonishing that people today happen to be offended by such accusations (i.e. about an event almost 2000 years ago)\\".\\"Are You a Christian?\\" \\"Do I Look Like the Pope?\\" – An Exchange Between Lenni Brenner & Gilad Atzmon, CounterPunch, 15 February 2007. In 2011, David Landy, an Irish academic and former chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, wrote that Atzmon's words, \\"if not actually anti-Semitic, certainly border on it\\". In 2012, the US Palestinian Community Network published a statement by three members of its National Coordinating Committee and other Palestinian activists, including Ali Abunimah, Naseer Aruri, Omar Barghouti, Nadia Hijab and Joseph Massad, calling for \\"the disavowal of Atzmon by fellow Palestinian organizers, as well as Palestine solidarity activists, and allies of the Palestinian people\\" and affirming that \\"we regard any attempt to link and adopt antisemitic or racist language, even if it is within a self-described anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist politics, as reaffirming and legitimizing Zionism.\\" At a talk by Richard Falk at LSE in March 2017 at which pro-Israel protestors were expelled for disruption, Atzmon commented that Jews had been \\"expelled from Germany for misbehaving\\", and to have recommended the works of David Irving, whose Holocaust denial views are widely known. Atzmon subsequently confirmed that he indeed recommends Irving's work and that in his view \\"Jews are always expelled for a reason\\". According to a joint report by Hope not Hate and Community Security Trust, in 2017 Aztmon gave talk to the conspiracy theory group Keep Talking in which he advanced the argument that the Balfour Declaration transpired to \\"conceal a century of Jewish political hegemony in Britain\\". In 2018, Islington Council stopped Atzmon from performing at the council-owned Islington Assembly Hall, as the council feared Atzmon's appearance could harm relationships between different races and religions. =Anti-racism organisations = David Neiwert, writing in the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch, described Atzmon as \\"a self- described 'self-hating ex-Jew' whose writings and pronouncements are rich in conspiracy theories, Holocaust trivialization and distortion, and open support of anti-Israeli terrorist groups.\\" The Anti-Defamation League described Atzmon as \\"an outspoken promoter of classic anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and a fierce critic of the State of Israel (who) has engaged in Holocaust diminution and has defended the right of Holocaust deniers to challenge historical narratives and offer revisionist theories about the Holocaust.\\". Hope not Hate described Atzmon as \\"an antisemite who has promoted the works of Holocaust deniers\\". relating the Holocaust denial support mainly to circulating a work of Paul Eisen. Atzmon has accused Hope Not Hate of being \\"an integral part of the Zionist network, dedicated to promoting Jewish tribal politics\\". =Scholarship= According to David Hirsh, Atzmon attempted to lead an antisemitic purge of the anti-zionist movement, which however runs counter to the anti-Racist values of most anti-zionists. Despite this, it took some time for the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and Socialist Workers Party to stop treating Atzmon as legitimate. Nicolas Terry, a historian of the Holocaust and of Holocaust revisionism at the University of Exeter, characterised Atzmon, along with Paul Eisen and Israel Shamir, as one of the very few Jewish Holocaust deniers who were associated with Deir Yassin Remembered. Terry notes that after the Palestine Solidarity Campaign expelled several Holocaust deniers, Atzmon rallied other sympathisers around the Deliberation website. According to Spencer Sunshine, a researcher on the far-right, Atzmon along with Israel Shamir and Alison Weir forms an axis of crypto-antisemites who recycle traditional antisemitic conspiracy theories with the replacement of \\"the Jews\\" with a code word or synecdoche. Sunshine states that Atzmon denounces Judaism itself as the root issue in Zionism, With Atzmon framing Israeli atrocities as a \\"historic relationship to gentiles, an authentic expression of an essentially racist, immoral, and anti-human ‘Jewish ideology.’\\". Sunshine notes that Atzmon's appearances on White nationalist media such as Counter Currents has not stopped Atzmon from being platformed in left-wing publications such as CounterPunch. =Responses= Atzmon describes charges of antisemitism as being a \\"common Zionist silencing apparatus\\".Barnaby Smith, Sax With An Axe To Grind, Interview with Gilad Atzmon in London Tour Dates magazine, 5 October 2006 and claims that \\"there is an international smear campaign against me\\". According to Atzmon, his statements have lost him performance contracts, especially in the United States,Karen Abi-Ezzi, \\"Music as a Discourse of Resistance: The Case of Gilad Atzmon”, Chapter 7 of Olivier Urbain, Editor, Music and conflict transformation: harmonies and dissonances in geopolitics, I.B. Tauris, 2008 p. 101. while in Britain, the Campaign Against Antisemitism has sought to stop him performing.

Musical career The band first made its appearance on the queercore record label Outpunk Records, on its compilation Outpunk Dance Party. Soon afterwards they released their first EP, Vespa Sex, also on Outpunk, followed later by a 7\\" single. Like other bands influenced by the nascent riot grrrl scene in Olympia, Washington, New York no wave, and European post-punk, core members of Sta-Prest - Aloofah (Iraya Robles), Dudley Manlove (Gary Fembot), and Professor Swish (Mark Bishop) - adopted pseudonyms, swapped instruments between songs, and practiced a consensus-based approach to song composition. A revolving membership included Tetley, Twi Tybat, Clutch-y-Spun, and Scout. Their avant-pop sound and combination of male and female vocals were unique in the Queercore scene. After Outpunk Records ceased to exist, the band recorded for the label Kill Rock Stars, releasing their final 7\\" ep. As well, they produced a video for one of their songs for the Kill Rock Stars video compilation, Kill Rock Stars Video Fanzine, which also included a short movie by member Gary Fembot, called The Oners. In 1997, the band appeared in performance in the seminal documentary film She's Real, Worse Than Queer by Lucy Thane. In 2002, Aloofah, (Iraya Robles) and Dudley Manlove, (Gary Fembot), appeared in Maximum Rocknroll's \\"Queer Punk\\" issue, featured in a discussion with the queer-identified musicians Martin Sorrondeguy of both Los Crudos and Limp Wrist and Aaron Detroit of The Little Deaths. Spin-off bands from Sta-Prest include Feelings On A Grid, with Dudley Manlove a.k.a. D.M. Feelings (Gary Fembot) and Le Grid, a.k.a. Stanley Lamontagne, both heavily influenced by the sounds and aesthetics of the electropunk bands Suicide and The Screamers. Professor Swish, now Mmothra, privately released a recording of ambient digital loopscapes after the style of Nurse with Wound and :zoviet*France, entitled Neurotic Styles. Gary Fembot now plays keyboards and sings with the band Puce Moment. Dudley Manlove (Gary Fembot) and Professor Swish (Mark Bishop) recorded as The Swishin' Duds, and are included on the soundtrack of the 2008 movie The Lollipop Generation by G.B. Jones, in which Gary Fembot appears in a cameo role.

Domesday Book: v.25, Shropshire Phillimore, 1986, p.1 It was mentioned in Domesday, and later became part of the possessions of the Botterell family. The village is located near to the English-Welsh border, at the foot of Corndon Hill. Due to a quirk of the border geography in the area of Corndon Hill, the nearest village in Wales, White Grit, lies to the east of Priestweston. Second World War Victoria Cross winner John Brunt was born there in 1922 and his family lived there before moving to near Whittington some six years later. An outdoor memorial plaque to his memory was put up in the village in May 2004. The village church at Middleton-in-Chirbury is located a mile from Priestweston.

Description The manuscript pages measure 21 х 14 centimeters. It is in the collection of the SS Cyril and Methodius National Library.  Provenance  The manuscript was for a long time in the possession of Mano Kalpakchim, a well-known contractor and book-lover of the 18th century. It is now at the Bulgarian National Library in Sofia, courtesy of N. Hristov of Tzaribrod, Serbia. Analysis Among others, the manuscript collection discusses the well-known life-story of Alexander the Great, the son of Philip II, king of Macedon, who lived in the 4th century BC, and subjects classified as secular Middle Ages literature, including Southern Slavic literature. In the Middle Ages, the Latin version of the manuscript collection was widely available in Western Europe. One of them, created in the 10th century, served as a basis for many adaptations in the French, German and Czech literatures. Two versions appeared in different times in the Slavic south: Bulgarian (10th–11th century) and Serbian (end of the 13th century, and the beginning of the 14th century. The Bulgarian National Library manuscript is one of the earliest Slavic transcriptions of this work, abounding in illustrations. It contains the Serbian version of the story, popularly known as the \\"Serbian Alexandria\\". As a typical work of the literature of the fantastic heroes, with a rich and entertaining narrative, this story was well known in the 14th century and 15th century in the Slavic world. Encouraged by printed editions of the work, interest in it continued until the 19th century.  References Sources  * CHRISTIANS, Dagmar.

Early life and education  When about 12 years of age, he attended the Kumamoto Yogakko where American soldier Capt. L. L. James was engaged. In 1876, he was studying theology in Doshisha. He went to America in 1885 when 25 years of age, and he entered the Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He took the degree of B.S. He went to Johns Hopkins University where he worked in organic chemistry under Prof. Ira Remsen. He also obtained practical technique of Solvay in Bruxelles. Coke-oven and Coke manufacture Dr. Shimomura was the first to produce coke on a large scale in quality and hardness equal to best English and German coke by suitable blending of materials and suitable method of heating, which eventually superseded the foreign articles entire He erected the first by-product ovens in Japan, and when built and started, the enterprise was considered to be a reckless endeavor. But gradually the number of ovens has increased and there were more than a thousand coke-ovens of by- product type. This method of blending was adopted by all the subsequent manufacturers. Ammonium sulphate, naphthalene and benzene Shimomura was one of the earliest workers on ammonium sulphate to produce it on a large scale and put it on the market as a fertilizer in the days when its superiority to sodium nitrate in Japanese soils was not very well recognized. He was not an expert in tar distillation and was among the first to produce naphthalene in powder, balls and cakes at a time when its smell was objected to as something unbearable. He was the first to put up a plant to extract benzene from coke-oven gas, when it was thought that it would not sell. This fear was subsequently contradicted by increased demand for benzene as solvent, motor oil and also an important raw material for dyestuffs. In the time of the world war, Japan was amply provided with benzene obtained from coke-oven gas to make the manufacture of dyestuffs independent of foreign supply. Gas Industry When Dr. Shimomura became connected with Osaka Gas Company, it was producing to supply about 700,000 c. ft. per day of gas. As a director, he was responsible for the extensions up to the several millions c. ft. a day. With the Osaka Seimi Works Company a similar growth took place and he was responsible for the works development from one battery to three batteries, from 16 to 73 ovens, from 600 tons of coke to 6000 tons per month. In the year 1909 he determined to devote the surplus gas of the by-product ovens of the Seimi Works of two companies, the Osaka Gas and the Seimi, and by means of a compressor which had been used for riveting a gas-holder, about 200,00 c. ft. were sent out daily under high pressure. This is regarded as the first attempt in Japan to use the high-pressure conveyance, the method since then becoming so prevalent in this country, Wood Preserving Industry The importance of subjecting railway sleepers to some preserving process was insisted on by Dr. Shiga, and a company was formed to use creosote oil mixed with Zinc compound; but owing to the lack of tar oil, the enterprise was in a precarious condition, when Dr. Shimomura was enabled to put a large quantity of creosote oil to its use, resulting in the formation of the Toyo Wood Preserving Company. The wood preserving business has steadily developed. Dyestuff Manufacture In his travels abroad, besides investigating coke-ovens, he took every opportunity to get a glimpse of the dyestuffs works and was favored with rare chances of inspecting inside of some works in England. When the world war broke out, he was found to be one of the very few among native chemists who had given any attention to the preparation of dyestuffs and was asked to take the position of the managing chief chemist to start the works of company, - the Japan Dyestuff Manufacturing Company. In view of the extraordinary circumstances, he consented to do so in spite of the impaired eyesight under which he was suffering. Thus was inaugurated the manufacturing of the dyestuffs on a large scale, one of the most ambitious projects that Japan had ever undertaken in competition with the West.

It aired on May 13, 2004, in the 11th year of the series. In syndication, it is a two-part episode. Plot Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) is on an airplane when he is surprised by the anxiety the woman sitting next to him suffers during the flight. The woman introduces herself as Dr. Anne Ranberg (Jennifer Beals), also a psychiatrist, and after brief deliberation, Frasier decides to disclose what is on his mind, in hopes that it will help pass the time on the flight. Frasier's girlfriend, Charlotte (Laura Linney), is leaving for Chicago, leaving Frasier devoid of any current love life. To commemorate her leaving for Chicago, Frasier and Charlotte sleep together on her final night in Seattle, resulting in a problem as Frasier misses his regularly scheduled radio show, which results in station manager Kenny Daly taking over at the last minute who quickly starts to enjoy himself. Once Frasier arrives, he bumps into his agent Bebe, where he learns about a job opening on a San Francisco television network after a death occurred there, but Frasier quickly declines, citing his comfort with his present situation at KACL. In the meantime, his brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) and Niles' wife Daphne (Jane Leeves) are anticipating the birth of their child, while his father, Martin (John Mahoney), is set to be married to Ronee (Wendie Malick). A mishap occurs when Martin schedules the wedding for May 15 instead of July 15. Frasier and Niles agree to plan the wedding in eight days. As the two are frantically putting the wedding together, both Frasier and Niles encounter numerous difficulties. Three of Daphne's brothers, Simon, Stephen, and Michael, are in Seattle in anticipation of Daphne's childbirth. Frasier has arranged for a ceremonial cannon-firing when Martin and Ronee are officially declared married. However, the person Frasier puts in position has a heat stroke from standing out in the sun too long, making him unusable. Michael volunteers to do the job instead and is told the cue from Frasier. However, Frasier and Niles also have to deal with finding a new flower girl, as the three brothers have accidentally intoxicated her, rendering her unconscious. Roz (Peri Gilpin) allows her daughter Alice to do the job in the flower girl's stead, but upon receiving the same cue as Michael was told, Michael fires off the cannon, creating havoc in the neighborhood. Daphne and Niles realize Eddie has eaten the rings and take him to a local veterinarian. While they are at the vet's office, Daphne goes into labor. Frasier, Martin, and Ronee all hurry to the clinic, where Daphne has given birth to the couple's first child, whom they name David. Ronee suggests that she and Martin get married in the clinic, so Daphne and Niles do not miss out, and Frasier marries them. Later, a mover (the same from the first episode) returns to Frasier's residence to take away Martin's chair. Frasier calls Lilith to ask after Frederick. Afterwards, he finds himself with the peace and quiet he was once desperate for. However, with Martin having moved out and Niles and Daphne busy with their new son, Frasier realizes that he is lonely. He decides to take the job in San Francisco. The following day, Frasier and his colleagues learn that Roz has been promoted to station manager after Kenny quits to become a DJ. Frasier invites his brother, father, Daphne, Ronee, and Roz to his apartment to announce his move to San Francisco. However, before the dinner, Frasier begins handing out gifts of significance. When an ominous phone call answered by the answering machine from a doctor reveals potentially bad news regarding Frasier's future outlook, the attendees fear the worst. Frasier then informs them of his impending move to San Francisco, where his new show will begin the following week. Later, during the celebration, Frasier reveals his reasoning for taking the job, citing that with Daphne and Niles' child, Martin and Ronee's marriage, and Roz's promotion, each of them have now begun a new phase of their lives, and that he now desires to do the same. Frasier then recites Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem \\"Ulysses\\". He reads the same poem at the end of his final show at KACL, where he thanks the staff and listeners for the past eleven years before closing with his signature words \\"Goodnight, Seattle.\\" Frasier finishes his story just as the plane lands – not in San Francisco, but in Chicago, where Charlotte has moved – and says, \\"Wish me luck,\\" to Anne before heading down the aisle as the screen fades to black. Frasier’s farewell speech The poem Frasier quotes in this episode is a shortened version of Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s \\"Ulysses\\": > \\"It may be that the gulfs will wash us down; > It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, > And though we are not now that strength which in old days > Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are— > [Scene shifts to Frasier’s KACL booth.] > Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will; > To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\\" > I’ve been thinking about that poem a lot lately. And I think what it says is > that, while it’s tempting to play it safe, the more we’re willing to risk, > the more alive we are. In the end, what we regret most are the chances we > never took. And I hope that explains, at least a little, this journey on > which I am about to embark. I have loved every minute with my KACL family, > and all of you. For eleven years you've heard me say, \\"I’m listening.\\" Well, > you were listening, too. And for that I am eternally grateful. Goodnight, > Seattle.

Formerly the administrative centre of Pittwater Council, it is now located in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council. The traditional custodians of the area are the Guringai people.  History  The area was known as \\"Bongin Bongin\\" by Aboriginal Peoples. The initial land grants in the district of Pittwater were not made until April 1813, and those sections which now comprise Mona Vale, first surveyed in May 1814, were granted to Robert Campbell (1769-1846). These were originally part of that extended northwards from Mona Vale to the end of Newport beach.Martin Burke The Father of Pittwater - page 53, By James J Macken, National Library of Australia Local lore suggests the name Mona Vale was chosen by Campbell in remembrance of a town bearing the same name in Scotland, however the exact location of this place remains a mystery. In 2005, Mona Vale became the administrative centre of Pittwater Council, after the council chambers moved from Warriewood. Since then, Pittwater Council has been amalgamated with Warringah and Manly to form the Northern Beaches Council. Landmarks Mona Vale has two primary schools and a high school, an RSL club, a park, public library, golf course, hospital, a world class skate park, a bus depot, three supermarkets, and a variety of shops and businesses. There are also a number of pathways and walking tracks around the area.

Looking northwards from the children's and lap pool towards \\"The Basin.\\" Mona Vale has a shallow beach (formerly known as \\"Bongin Bongin\\" Beach) which has a children's and lap pool at its northern end, with the main beach adjoining the golf course and a number of parks and reserves. There is a second beach north of this which is known as \\"The Basin\\" with a concentrated wave which, since the early 2000s, has been known as \\"Whomp\\" which is popular with body boarders. Mona Vale is a popular beach for surfing with beach breaks including \\"Main\\", \\"Suck Rock\\", and \\"Rip Bowl\\". Population In the 2016 Census there were 10,670 people domiciled in Mona Vale, of which 70.7% of these were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 8.0%, New Zealand 2.2% and South Africa 1.4%.

The LaFollettes had lived in the Knob Creek area of Kentucky for a generation before William's grandfather, Jesse LaFollette relocated his entire family to Putnam County, Indiana in order to leave land title and slavery issues behind him. William's brother, Harvey Marion LaFollette, and his cousin, Robert M. La Follette, Sr., were both born in Primrose in log cabins built by the two LaFollette brothers. After Josiah's premature death from diabetes, William's father returned to Indiana, settling near other LaFollette relatives where he continued farming and built a flour mill. William's birth took place shortly after his family's arrived in Thorntown, Indiana late in 1860. For five years additional siblings arrived and his family grew and prospered. Tragedy struck in 1865 when his father was killed in an industrial accident at the mill. William worked on the farm, clerked in a store, learned the jewelry business, and attended the local normal (public) schools. William and his older brother, Harvey, both left their Indiana home in 1876. Harvey travelled to Europe to continue his studies in Paris. The sixteen-year-old William headed west to the Washington Territory and took up farming in Whitman County, an area in the Palouse that had been off limits to settlers since the Indian Wars of the 1850s. Too young to qualify for land under the Homestead Act, he returned to Indiana where he took some business courses at Central Indiana Normal College (now Canterbury College (Indiana). Business career He returned to the Palouse after these studies, staked his claim and began farming. He engaged in agricultural pursuits (mainly wheat), stock raising, and fruit growing. Later, he was extensively engaged as an orchardist at Wawawai on the Snake River, having purchased some 375 ac from his father-in-law, John Tabor (one of the founders of Whitman County) who had been among the first settlers to bring apples to the region. He added to these fruit holdings, expanded his crops, built an aerial tramway to transfer the fruit across river to access the new railroad, created a sawmill to make the wooden boxes for shipping, and was responsible for making Wawawai the largest shipping point for fruit along the Snake River. He shipped many vegetables and hogs as well as fruit and, by the early 1900s, his land holdings along the river exceeded 1000 ac. In order to educate his family, La Follette built a large home in Pullman to be near Washington State College. He sold a large portion of his fruit holdings and entered the world of national politics.http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88085488/1910-04-29/ed-1/seq-1.pdf Public service La Follette was a member of the World's Fair Commission and had charge of the Washington State building at the Chicago Exposition in 1893. He served as a member of the State House of Representatives from 1899 to 1901. He also served on the School Board and was an active member of the Grange. He was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-second and to the three succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1911 to March 3, 1919). He was active on the House Committee on Public Lands and engaged deeply in land use and water issues. His policy interests reached far beyond the region he represented in the Pacific Northwest. He fought for the passage of bills that brought water to San Francisco and the creation of the National Park Service.http://www.nps.gov/legacy/organic-act.htm He joined with his cousin, Robert M. La Follette in opposing President Woodrow Wilson's foreign policy decisions, and like his cousin voted against declaring war on Germany. For much of the time he was in Congress, the two LaFollette families shared a large house that he had purchased in Mount Pleasant, Washington D.C. The house became a center for debate and discussions of the great issues of the day as a steady stream of politicians, policy makers, academics, artists and labor and business leaders debated late into the night. In 1918 he ran unsuccessfully for renomination in the Republican primary. Later years After leaving elected office La Follette resided in Spokane, Washington from 1920 to 1923 and in Princess Anne, Maryland from 1924 to 1925.After the failed presidential bid and death of his cousin Robert, William La Follette returned permanently to the Palouse.http://international.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2006/ms006038.pdf He moved to Colfax, Washington in 1927 and resumed his former business activities. Both he and his wife, Mary Tabor, died in 1934. Family He was a member of the politically prominent La Follette family. His son, William Leroy \\"Roy\\" LaFollette Jr., served for many years as Prosecuting Attorney for Whitman County (1922–1930 and again during World War II). He successfully ran for his father's old seat in the Washington House of Representatives in 1939, but was defeated in 1942 in a bid for Congress. One of his daughters, Suzanne La Follette, became a noted libertarian journalist. She helped to found The Freeman and National Review magazines. Another son, Chester La Follette, was a painter whose portrait of his father's first cousin, U.S. Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin, hangs in the United States Capitol. William La Follette Sr.'s brother, Harvey Marion LaFollette, served as Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction before moving to Tennessee, where he founded the city of LaFollette, Tennessee.

Sheffield has long been the rural hub for the Mount Roland area. The Sheffield area is well known for its high quality butterfat production via dairy farming. The area is suitable for lamb and beef production. The town of Railton is nearby. At the , Sheffield had a population of 1,552. History Sheffield was one of the many early townships settled in 1859. The town was named by Edward Curr after his home town in South Yorkshire, England.Sheffield, Tasmania, Tourism Tasmania Kentishbury Post Office opened on 1 November 1862 and was renamed Sheffield in 1882. The area grew slowly and the commencement of the Mersey-Forth Power Development Scheme in 1963 saw the town grow dramatically. The completion of the power scheme –- seven dams and seven power stations –- in 1973 saw the town's population decline. Sheffield's revival as the Town of Murals began as a bid by a small group of residents determined to save their town. =Town of Murals= Inspired by the story of Chemainus, a small Canadian town that had through mural art, rescued itself from ruin, the Kentish Association for Tourism (KAT) worked on the vision to combine the arts and tourism to revive and reinvent the town of Sheffield.

There are walking tracks from Claude Road and Gowrie Park to the summit. The walk includes the plains and plateau leading to the peak. There are two tracks to the summit, which provide 360-degree views to Bass Strait, Cradle Mountain and Barn Bluff.SheffieldTasmania = Lake Barrington = Lake Barrington is known as an international standard rowing venue and the site of the 1990 World Rowing Championships. It was created in 1969 by building the Devils Gate Dam on the Forth River. The lake is a popular water ski location with access via West Kentish and Wilmot. There are two water ski clubs based at Lake Barrington: Kentish Aquatic Club and Horsehead Water Ski Club. The lake is also used for canoeing and trout fishing. There is an adventure playground and a two-hour rainforest walk. Facilities for visitors include picnic sites, boat ramps and toilets.Lake Barrington, Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania = Devils Gate Dam = The Devils Gate Dam has an overhanging crest that allows flood water to freefall to the river bed, with up to 2000 tonnes of water falling per second during an extreme flood. It is one of the thinnest concrete arch dams in the world. It was completed by the Hydro-Electric Commission in 1969 and is 84 metres high. The narrowness of the gorge and the computer-aided design of its double-curvature shape enabled engineers to minimise the volume of concrete and hence the cost of the dam. Flood waters falling freely from the crest strike concrete slabs carefully positioned on the abutments to prevent undermining of the dam by erosion.Devil's Gate Dam, Engineers Australia = Lake Cethana = The walk starts at the junction just before turning into the Lemonthyme Lodge. The walk takes about two hours and allows visitors to observe the varieties of vegetation of the area. After crossing two areas of cleared land the track crosses a fern gully, beyond which there is more forest until the track terminates in the backwater of the lake. This walk is graded as hard because the return trip is a long haul uphill.SheffieldTasmania.com.au = Kimberley Warm Springs = Kimberley Warm Springs are a geothermal feature and semi- developed visitor site located in the town of Kimberley.

Buchanan, Sr was an American jazz trumpeter and teacher who became an early mentor of Miles Davis. Buchanan was born in St Louis, Missouri on January 26, 1907, and was trained in music by Joseph Gustat, the principal trumpeter with the St Louis Symphony Orchestra. He began his career playing in local dance bands, including Andy Kirk's orchestra, and on the riverboats that travelled on the Mississippi River between St Louis and New Orleans. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, he taught music and directed the band at Lincoln High School in East St Louis, and also visited the local elementary schools to give weekly lessons. Buchanan was known for his strict and demanding teaching style, and for encouraging pupils to compete with one another. Buchanan was a patient of Miles Davis's father, who told him of his son's interest in music. Although Davis, at thirteen, was then too young to attend Buchanan's school, Buchanan began giving him private lessons. Davis joined the school band when he began attending Lincoln. Although Buchanan had the band play mainly marches rather than jazz, the techniques he taught profoundly affected Davis' jazz style. In particular, Buchanan went against the times by recommending to his students that they play without vibrato, and is said to have broken Davis of the habit by rapping his knuckles with a ruler and commanding: \\"Stop shakin' that note. You're going to shake enough when you get old\\". Buchanan also encouraged Davis to study the lean, relaxed playing of Bobby Hackett (then little known beyond the East Coast) and Harold Shorty Baker. In this, too, Buchanan went against fashion; the most popular trumpeter of the day was Louis Armstrong, whose hot playing style was very different from those of Hackett or Baker. Davis later credited Buchanan with persuading his parents to buy him a new trumpet, rather than a violin as his mother had preferred. Buchanan also introduced Davis to Clark Terry, who would become his recording partner. In his autobiography, Davis recalled: \\"Mr. Buchanan was the biggest influence on my life up until then. He was definitely the person who took me all the way into music at that time.\\" Sources * So What: The Life of Miles Davis by John Szwed (Simon & Schuster, 2002) * Milestones: The Music and Times of Miles Davies by J.K.

Dowling and Billy Ray, and starring Jodie Foster, Peter Sarsgaard, Erika Christensen, Kate Beahan, Greta Scacchi, Sean Bean, and Matt Bomer (in his film debut). A co-production of the United States and Germany, the film's narrative follows Kyle Pratt, a widowed American aircraft engineer living in Berlin, who flies back to the U.S. with her daughter and her husband's body only to lose her daughter during the flight and must struggle to find her while proving her sanity at the same time. Flightplan was distributed by Touchstone Pictures and was released worldwide theatrically on September 23, 2005. The film received mixed reviews from critics who acclaimed the performances of its cast but found the screenplay less competent. It grossed over $223 million. Plot Recently-widowed Kyle Pratt, a Berlin-based American aviation engineer, takes her husband David's body back to the U.S. with her 6-year-old daughter Julia, aboard an aircraft Kyle helped design. Awakening from a nap, Kyle finds Julia missing, and none of the passengers or crew recall seeing her. Flight attendant Stephanie tells Kyle there is no record of her daughter boarding the flight, and Kyle is unable to find Julia's boarding pass and backpack. At Kyle’s insistence, Captain Marcus Rich conducts a search of the aircraft, while the panicked Kyle is monitored by sky marshal Gene Carson. Growing desperate, Kyle accuses Arab passengers Obaid and Ahmed of kidnapping Julia and plotting to hijack the aircraft. She reveals that her husband died falling from their roof, which she refuses to believe was suicide. Captain Rich receives a message from a Berlin hospital that Julia died with her father, and is convinced that Kyle, unhinged by her husband and daughter's deaths, imagined bringing Julia on board. The increasingly erratic Kyle is confined to her seat, where a therapist, Lisa, consoles her. Kyle doubts her own sanity until she notices the heart Julia drew on the foggy window next to her seat. Kyle asks to use the bathroom, where she climbs into the overhead crawl space and sabotages the aircraft's electronics, deploying the oxygen masks and cutting power to the lighting. In the ensuing chaos, she rides a dumbwaiter to the lower freight deck and unlocks David's casket, suspecting Julia is inside, but finds only her husband's body. Carson escorts her to her seat in handcuffs, and explains that the flight is making an emergency stopover at Goose Bay Airport in Newfoundland, Canada where she will be taken into custody. She pleads with Carson to search the aircraft’s hold, and he sneaks down to the freight deck. Removing two explosives and a detonator concealed in David's casket, he plants the explosives in the avionics section, where a presumably drugged Julia is sleeping. It is revealed that Carson and Stephanie have conspired to hijack the aircraft for a $50 million ransom and frame Kyle, due to her knowledge of the aircraft; they abducted Julia to force Kyle to unlock the casket. Carson lies to Rich that Kyle is threatening to bomb the aircraft unless the ransom is wired to a bank account and a G3 aircraft is readied upon landing. He then plans to detonate the explosives, killing Julia, and leave Kyle dead with the detonator. Landing in Newfoundland, the airliner is surrounded by FBI agents. After the passengers disembark, Kyle confronts Rich, who angrily declares that the ransom has been paid. Kyle realizes that Carson is the perpetrator and, assuming the role of hijacker, commands Carson to remain aboard and the crew to leave. She strikes Carson with a fire extinguisher, handcuffs him to a rail, and takes the detonator. Stephanie appears as Carson shoots the cuffs to free himself and pursues Kyle, who locks herself in the cockpit. Tricking Carson into thinking she has left the cockpit, Kyle subdues Stephanie, who flees the airliner. Kyle finds the unconscious Julia, and Carson reveals that he murdered David to smuggle the explosives inside his casket. Kyle escapes with Julia into the aircraft's non-combustible hold, closing the door as Carson shoots at her. She detonates the explosives, killing Carson and destroying the front landing gear, but she and Julia emerge unscathed as the passengers realize that she told the truth the whole time. The next morning, Captain Rich apologizes to Kyle. As Stephanie is led away by the FBI, an agent informs Kyle that the Berlin mortuary director has also been arrested. Kyle carries Julia to a waiting van through the crowd of passengers, who realize the truth. Obaid hands Kyle her bag, as Julia awakens and asks, \\"Are we there yet?\\" before they drive away. CastProductionDevelopment= Peter A. Dowling had the idea for Flightplan in 1999 on a phone conversation with a friend. His original pitch for producer Brian Grazer involved a man who worked on airport security doing a business trip from the United States to Hong Kong, and during the flight his son went missing. A few years later, Billy Ray took over the script, taking out the terrorists from the story and putting more emphasis on the protagonist, who became a female as Grazer thought it would be a good role for Jodie Foster. The story then focused on the main character regaining her psyche, and added the post-September 11 attacks tension and paranoia. There was also an attempt to hide the identity of the villain by showcasing the different characters on the plane. Both Dowling and Ray were allowed to visit the insides of a Boeing 747 at the Los Angeles International Airport to develop the limited space on which the story takes place.\\"In-Flight Movie: 'The Making of Flightplan'.\\" Flightplan DVD, 2019. The film also draws on Alfred Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes, in which an older woman goes missing on board a train and only one passenger remembers her, especially in the scene where Kyle discovers the heart drawn by her daughter on the plane window. =Casting= Schwentke said that to make Flightplan as realistic as possible, he wanted naturalistic, subdued performances. One example was Peter Sarsgaard, whom he described as an actor \\"who can all of a sudden become a snake uncoiling\\". First-time actress Marlene Lawston became Foster's daughter Julia. Sean Bean was cast to subvert his typecasting as a villain, and mislead audiences into thinking he was part of the villainous plot. The director also picked each of the 300 passengers through auditions. =Filming= Schwentke described Flightplan as a \\"slow boiling\\" thriller, where the opening is different from the faster ending parts. The director added that sound was used to put audiences \\"off-kilter\\". The art direction team had to build all the interiors of the fictional E-474 from scratch, including the cockpit. The interior design and layout is similar to the Airbus A380. It is noted that the amount of dead space within the cabin, cargo and avionic areas do not reflect the actual amount of dead space within any aircraft. BE Aerospace provided various objects to \\"stage the scene\\"; \\"many of the interior sets used real aircraft components such as seats, gallies, etc.\\" To allow for varied camera angles, the set had many tracks for the camera dolly to move, and both the walls and the ceiling were built on hinges so they could easily be swung open for shooting. The design and colors tried to invoke the mood for each scene - for instance, a white room for \\"eerie, clinical, cold\\" moments, lower ceilings for claustrophobia, and wide open spaces to give no clues to the audience.\\"Cabin Pressure: Designing the Aalto E-474.\\" Flightplan DVD, 2019. Most exterior scenes of the \\"E-474\\" involve a model with 1/10th of the aircraft's actual size, with the images being subsequently enhanced through computer-generated imagery. The explosion in the nose involved both life sized and scaled pieces of scenery. A one-half scale set of the avionics area was constructed to make the explosion and fireball look bigger. =Music= The score for Flightplan was released September 20, 2005, on Hollywood Records. The music was composed and conducted by James Horner and the disc contains eight tracks. Horner stated that film's score tried to mix the sound effects with \\"the emotion and drive of the music\\", and the instruments were picked to match the \\"feelings of panic\\" Kyle goes on through the film. These included Gamelan instruments, prepared piano, and string arrangements. No brass instruments are used in the soundtrack. ReceptionBox office= Flightplan opened at #1 in US and Canada, grossing over $24 million in its opening weekend. It grossed $89,707,299 at the domestic box office and $133,680,000 overseas for a worldwide total of $223,387,299.\\"Box office: 'Flightplan' (2005).\\" Box Office Mojo. Retrieved: September 26. 2011. It also grossed $79,270,000 on DVD rentals. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 37% based on 177 reviews, with an average rating of 5.31/10. The site's consensus states: \\"The actors are all on key here, but as the movie progresses, tension deflates as the far-fetched plot kicks in.\\" On Metacritic, it has a score of 53 out of 100 rating, based on 33 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F. Film historian Leonard Maltin in Leonard Maltin's 2012 Movie Guide (2011) described Flightplan as \\"suspenseful at first, this thriller becomes remote and un- involving; by the climax, it's just plain ridiculous.\\"Maltin 2011. p. 472. Roger Ebert gave it 3 and a half out of 4 stars, praising its \\"airtight plot\\" and the acting performances. Other reviewers including the Christian Science Monitor criticised \\"plotholes the size of an Airbus in the script\\". Aviation film historian Simon D. Beck in The Aircraft-Spotter's Film and Television Companion (2016) noted that Flightplan was careful in setting the scene. \\" The aircraft is a fictional mammoth airliner called the 'E-474', a double-deck jumbo modeled strongly after the Airbus A-380, the large size being suitable for the missing-person plot of the film.\\"Beck 2016, p. 99. Controversy The Association of Professional Flight Attendants called for an official boycott of Flightplan, which they say depicts flight attendants as rude, uncaring, indifferent, and even one as a \\"terrorist.\\"\\"Flight attendants hope to ground 'Flightplan'.\\" Today, September 29, 2005.

Mateship is an Australian cultural idiom that embodies equality, loyalty and friendship. Russel Ward, in The Australian Legend (1958), saw the concept as a central one to the Australian people. Mateship derives from mate, meaning friend, commonly used in Australia as an amicable form of address.  Military context  Mateship is regarded as an Australian military virtue. For instance, the Australian Army Recruit Training Centre lists the \\"soldierly qualities\\" it seeks to instill as including \\"a will to win, dedication to duty, honour, compassion and honesty, mateship and teamwork, loyalty, and physical and moral courage.\\" The word mate bloomed during World War I, when many trenches were being built because of the machine gun. Many trenches were built which often stretched miles across war grounds. The words “diggers” and “mate” gained the same meaning and became interchangeable.  Australian Constitutional preamble  During the 1999 Australian constitutional referendum there was some consideration regarding the inclusion of the term \\"mateship\\" in the preamble of the Australian constitution. This proposed change was drafted by the Australian poet Les Murray, in consultation with the Prime Minister of the time, John Howard: > Australians are free to be proud of their country and heritage, free to > realise themselves as individuals, and free to pursue their hopes and > ideals. We value excellence as well as fairness, independence as dearly as > mateship. Murray was not supportive of the inclusion of \\"mateship\\" in the preamble, stating that it was \\"blokeish\\" and \\"not a real word\\", but the Prime Minister insisted it be included as the term, he said, had \\"a hallowed place in the Australian lexicon\\".Kitson, Jill: Mateship..., Lingua Franca (Radio National), 24 April 1999. Howard reluctantly dropped the term from the preamble, after the Australian Democrats refused to allow it to be passed by the Senate where they held the balance of power.Mateship: Hit for six, British Broadcasting Corporation, August 12, 1999. Since the referendum the Australian government has introduced the concept of mateship as a possible part of an Australian citizenship test, although it was unclear how endorsement of the values of mateship would be tested.Migrants need to learn mateship: PM, The Sydney Morning Herald, December 12, 2006.  More than friendship  Mateship is a concept that can be traced back to early colonial times. The harsh environment in which convicts and new settlers found themselves meant that men and women closely relied on each other for all sorts of help. In Australia, a 'mate' is more than just a friend and is a term that implies a sense of shared experience, mutual respect and unconditional assistance. The term includes use in ways other than friendship like getting someone's attention, replacing a name, questioning a statement, letting one know to calm down and referring to someone in a rash or harsh way. The use of such in a harsh or negative way can be traced back to the word \\"bastard\\". Around the 16th century, the word \\"mate\\" adopted a similar meaning. Only within the last two centuries, has the term connected itself with a meaning of friendship.

While some use Unicode by default,https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22841?hl=en many others will automatically choose between a legacy encoding and Unicode depending on the mail's content, either automatically or when the user requests it. Technical requirements for sending of messages containing non-ASCII characters by email include * encoding of certain header fields (subject, sender's and recipient's names, sender's organization and reply-to name) and, optionally, body in a content-transfer encoding * encoding of non-ASCII characters in one of the Unicode transforms * negotiating the use of UTF-8 encoding in email addresses and reply codes (SMTPUTF8) * sending the information about the content- transfer encoding and the Unicode transform used so that the message can be correctly displayed by the recipient (see Mojibake). If the sender's or recipient's email address contains non-ASCII characters, sending of a message requires also encoding of these to a format that can be understood by mail servers. Unicode support in protocols * RFC 6531 provides a mechanism for allowing non-ASCII email addresses encoded as UTF-8 in an SMTP or LMTP protocol Unicode support in message header To use Unicode in certain email header fields, e.g. subject lines, sender and recipient names, the Unicode text has to be encoded using a MIME \\"Encoded-Word\\" with a Unicode encoding as the charset. To use Unicode in domain part of email addresses, IDNA encoding must traditionally be used. Alternatively, SMTPUTF8 allows the use of UTF-8 encoding in email addresses (both in a local part and in domain name) as well as in a mail header section. Various standards had been created to retrofit the handling of non-ASCII data to the originally ASCII-only email protocol: * RFC 2047 provides support for encoding non-ASCII values such as real names and subject lines in email header * RFC 5890 provides support for encoding non- ASCII domain names in the Domain Name System * RFC 6532 allows the use of UTF-8 in a mail header section Unicode support in message bodies As with all encodings apart from US-ASCII, when using Unicode text in email, MIME must be used to specify that a Unicode transformation format is being used for the text. UTF-7, although sometimes considered deprecated, has an advantage over other Unicode encodings in that it does not require a transfer encoding to fit within the seven-bit limits of legacy Internet mail servers. On the other hand, UTF-16 must be transfer encoded to fit SMTP data format. Although not strictly required, UTF-8 is usually also transfer encoded to avoid problems across seven-bit mail servers. MIME transfer encoding of UTF-8 makes it either unreadable as a plain text (in the case of base64) or, for some languages and types of text, heavily size inefficient (in the case of quoted-printable). Some document formats, such as HTML, PostScript and Rich Text Format have their own 7-bit encoding schemes for non-ASCII characters and can thus be sent without using any special email encodings. E.g. HTML email can use HTML entities to use characters from anywhere in Unicode even if the HTML source text for the email is in a legacy encoding (e.g. 7-bit ASCII).

Several metropolitan areas were created under this law (Algarve, Aveiro, Coimbra, Minho and Viseu), but a law passed in 2008 abolished these, converting them into intermunicipal communities, whose territories are (roughly) based on the NUTS III statistical regions.

Valerius Anshelm (1475 - 1546/1547), born as Valerius Rüd (or Ryd), was a Swiss chronicler working in Bern. Anshelm was born in Rottweil, a city in Swabia that was allied with the Old Swiss Confederacy. His grandfather „Boley der Rüd genannt Anshelm“ had fought on the side of the Eidgenossen in the Burgundy Wars. After studies in Kraków (1493-95) and Tübingen (until 1499) he spent some time as a travelling scholar (in 1501, he was in Lyon). He then settled in Bern, where he was appointed on 22 August 1505 the headmaster of the Latin school. In 1508, he became the city physician. As a sympathizer of the Reformation, he corresponded with reformers such as Zwingli and Vadian. A critical remark of his wife on the veneration of Mary earned him a reprimand by the city council and a substantial pay cut in 1523, and as a consequence the family moved to Rottweil two years later. However, there he got involved in the conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, too, and even spent some time in jail. When the Protestants were banned from Rottweil in 1529, he more than gladly followed a call of Bern (which had become Protestant in 1528) to serve as the city's chronicler. From 1535 to 1537 he again served also as the city physician. He died between 1 August 1546 and 21 February 1547; the exact date is unknown. Anshelm's appointment as chronicler was based on his having written a Latin chronicle of world history already during his first stay in Bern. Written in 1510, it was not printed until 1540, but Anshelm had distributed handwritten copies before. His main opus, however, was the Berner Chronik, a history of the city of Bern on which he worked in his position as city chronicler until his death. After a brief introduction to the early history, it covered especially the time from the Burgundy Wars until 1536, although only fragments of the period of 1526 to 1536 survived. It remained buried in the municipal archives of Bern and was thus not widely known until the 17th century, when Michael Stettler was commissioned to continue Anshelm's work. Stettler's own Schweizerchronik, a history of Switzerland that was based on Anshelm's work, appeared first in 1626.

That is, the malicious content may be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the browser or plugins to run malicious code without the user's knowledge. A drive-by install (or installation) is a similar event. It refers to installation rather than download (though sometimes the two terms are used interchangeably).  Process  When creating a drive-by download, an attacker must first create their malicious content to perform the attack. With the rise in exploit packs that contain the vulnerabilities needed to carry out drive-by download attacks, the skill level needed to perform this attack has been reduced. The next step is to host the malicious content that the attacker wishes to distribute. One option is for the attacker to host the malicious content on their own server. However, because of the difficulty in directing users to a new page, it may also be hosted on a compromised legitimate website, or a legitimate website unknowingly distributing the attackers content through a third party service (e.g. an advertisement). When the content is loaded by the client, the attacker will analyze the fingerprint of the client in order to tailor the code to exploit vulnerabilities specific to that client. Finally, the attacker exploits the necessary vulnerabilities to launch the drive-by download attack. Drive-by downloads usually use one of two strategies. The first strategy is exploiting API calls for various plugins. For example, the DownloadAndInstall API of the Sina ActiveX component did not properly check its parameters and allowed the downloading and execution of arbitrary files from the internet. The second strategy involves writing shellcode to memory, and then exploiting vulnerabilities in the web browser or plugin to divert the control flow of the program to the shell code. After the shellcode has been executed, the attacker can perform further malicious activities. This often involves downloading and installing malware, but can be anything, including stealing information to send back to the attacker. The attacker may also take measures to prevent detection throughout the attack. One method is to rely on the obfuscation of the malicious code. This can be done through the use of IFrames. Another method is to encrypt the malicious code to prevent detection. Generally the attacker encrypts the malicious code into a ciphertext, then includes the decryption method after the ciphertext.  Detection  Detection of drive-by download attacks is an active area of research. Some methods of detection involve anomaly detection, which tracks for state changes on a user's computer system while the user visits a webpage. This involves monitoring the user's computer system for anomalous changes when a web page is rendered. Other methods of detection include detecting when malicious code (shellcode) is written to memory by an attacker's exploit. Another detection method is to make run-time environments that allow JavaScript code to run and track its behavior while it runs. Other detection methods include examining contents of HTML pages to identify features that can be used to identify malicious web pages, and using characteristics of web servers to determine if a page is malicious. Some antivirus tools use static signatures to match patterns of malicious scripts, although these are not very effective because of obfuscation techniques. Detection is also possible by using low-interaction or high-interaction honeyclients. Drive-by downloads can also be prevented from occurring by using script-blockers such as NoScript, which can easily be added into browsers such as Firefox. Using such a script-blocker, the user can disable all the scripts in a given webpage, and then selectively re-enable individual scripts on a one-by-one basis in order to determine which ones are truly necessary for webpage functionality. In this way, a whitelist of acceptable scripts can quickly be developed, which in turn facilitates convenient, safe, and efficient browsing of other websites. Such script- blocking also saves time and bandwidth (hence money) for the user, because scripts that load advertising (especially targeted ads) and invade the user's privacy (via tracking and profiling) no longer constitute a personal drain on the user and his/her resources.

The mountain receives over of snow annually, with a season from early December until mid-April. Half of the terrain is rated as advanced, and 15% is rated beginner. Mount Ashland's \\"Bowl\\" A Non-Profit Ski Area Mt. Ashland is a community-focused ski area that is owned and operated by the non- profit Mt. Ashland Association. Mt. Ashland is dedicated to providing an outstanding alpine recreation experience for people of all ages and skill levels. To help meet its mission, Mt. Ashland offers the popular After School Youth Program which offers low-cost and free instruction to local youth. The 7,500' Crew Internship program also offers young people an opportunity to grow and develop at the ski area.  History  Mount Ashland's Lodge During the 1950s, the mountain was a popular destination for local back country ski enthusiasts, some of whom built the lodge and one lift in 1963. In the 1970s, the area was managed by the Southern Oregon College Foundation (now Southern Oregon University) until it was purchased by Dick Hicks, a local businessman, in 1977. In 1983, the ski area was sold to Harbor Properties of Seattle, the owners of Stevens Pass Ski Area. Two new lifts were built during their ownership and night skiing lights were installed. In 1991, the City of Ashland purchased the ski resort through a community fundraising campaign and a grant from the Oregon Economic Development Fund. The slogan of the community fundraising campaign was \\"Save Mount Ashland.\\" In 1929 the City of Ashland got the Forest Service to agree that the city would participate in any forest management that might impact water quality of the Ashland Creek watershed, the city's main municipal water supply. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s backcountry skiing on Mount Ashland grew in popularity among local residents, prompting some to envision a developed ski area. Mount Ashland chairlift in summer During 1961 to 1963, the Mount Ashland Corporation raised money to clear trees, grade terrain, build roads, and develop a ski area. It includes a ski lodge, the Ariel chairlift, a T-bar lift, and a rope tow on the north face of the mountain. Medford businessman Glenn Jackson provided more than half of the $120,000 that financed construction of the lodge. In 1970, after three consecutive years of winter drought deprived the mountain of adequate snowfall to continue operations, the Mount Ashland Corporation folded. The Southern Oregon College Foundation took over management the ski area after the people of Jackson County financed the purchase of ski area resources in the first of two public bailouts in the operation's history. In 1975, the City of Ashland signed a new Memorandum of Understanding with USFS in which the city agreed to hire consultants to monitor conditions in the Ashland Creek watershed and USFS agreed to implement any measures necessary to maintain watershed quality. In 1977, Dick Hicks purchased the ski area from Jackson County and incorporated it as Ski Ashland, Inc. In 1978, Ski Ashland installed the Windsor chairlift. The monitoring effort led by USFS Ashland district ranger, Glendon Jefferies, observed the East Fork of Ashland Creek flowing \\"a solid reddish brown\\" below the ski area. Jefferies wrote to Ski Ashland in 1978, \\"The Mount Ashland Ski Area is a major source of sediment pollution in the East Fork of Ashland Creek.\\" A 1979 report by James Montgomery to the city administrator made a similar finding. In 1983, Harbor Properties of Seattle purchased Ski Ashland from Hicks. Over the next four years, Harbor developed on-slope lighting, a vehicle shop, and the Sonnet and Comer chair lifts. Drought struck again in 1988–1991 and skier use declined. In 1991 a grassroots effort raised two million dollars to save Mount Ashland from bankruptcy. Money for the purchase came from donor restricted contributions and a grant from the Oregon Economic Development Fund channeled through the City of Ashland. The city accepted donated funds and purchased Ski Ashland from Harbor Properties. The city then hired Mount Ashland Association (MAA), a newly formed non-profit corporation, to maintain and operate the ski area. In 1992, the City of Ashland entered a lease agreement with MAA. The lease expires on June 30, 2017, with an option to be renewed or terminated. From 2005 through 2008, the City and MAA had a series of legal disputes, which were resolved with the City relinquishing the Special Use Permit to MAA with certain requirements to protect the Ashland Watershed. Mt. Ashland hosted the Oregon Interscholastic Racing Association high school state championships in 2007 and 2016. The Mt. Ashland Association continues to manage the ski area for the benefit for the entire community. Numerous programs benefiting the community include the 7,500' Crew teen internship program, the deeply-discounted After School Youth Program, the ACCESS Ski & Ride for Hunger day, and the Women of Winter program. summit  Expansion  The ski area attempted to expand its terrain and add lifts in the 1990s. The proposal is still being debated and is well documented in the Mount Ashland Ski Area Expansion article.  Other activities  Mount Ashland is a popular destination in summer for hiking, mountain biking, and sightseeing. The southernmost stretch of the Pacific Crest Trail in Oregon skirts the south and east sides of the mountain. The Mt. Ashland Hillclimb Run starts in Lithia Park near downtown Ashland and runners run up a series of Forest Service roads and trails to the summit of Mt. Ashland: 13+ miles long, 1 mile up. The Jean Chinn Memorial Mount Ashland Hill Climb Race is a hill climb, and a combination road and mountain bike race, starting from the town of Ashland and ending at the Mount Ashland ski area parking lot, with a different route for road and mountain bikes. The Siskiyou Out Back is a set of 3 races: a 15 kilometer (9.3 mi) trail run and 50 kilometer (31 mi) and 50 mile (80.5k) ultramarathon trail runs, starting and ending at the Mount Ashland ski area parking lot. Finally, the Mt. Ashland 5K Trail Run, America's Friendliest 5K, begins in the ski area parking lot, with runners ascending to the summit and returning to the parking lot via a series of roads leading down from the summit. The peak is also the site of the transmitter and antenna for KTVL Channel 10 television, based in Medford, Oregon, approximately 15 miles (24 km) to the north.  Climate  Mount Ashland Ski Area has an oceanic subalpine climate (Köppen climate classification Dsc). The record high temperature at the Mount Ashland Ski Area is , while the record low is . Yearly rainfall averages over , while snowfall averages over . The high elevation results in heavy precipitation, despite being located at the end of the Rogue Valley, which is located in a rain shadow.

Robert Kerr, 1st Marquess of Lothian (8 March 1636 – 15 February 1703), known as the 4th Earl of Lothian from 1675 to 1701, was a Scottish nobleman. He was styled Lord Kerr until 1661 and Lord Newbattle from 1661 to 1675. The eldest son of William Kerr, 3rd Earl of Lothian, he was born at Newbattle, Midlothian. He left Scotland and was educated at Leyden, Saumur, and Angers from 1651 to 1657. He unsuccessfully claimed the earldom of Roxburghe in 1658. In 1661, his father lost an additional dispute with the new Earl of Roxburghe over the use of the courtesy title of Lord Kerr; it was reserved for Roxburghe's heir, and Kerr was thereafter styled Lord Newbattle. Parliamentary Register, 1661 Lord Newbattle was a volunteer in the Dutch War of 1673. He succeeded his father in the earldom in 1675. Sworn a Privy Counsellor in January 1686, he was removed by James II in September. Lothian supported the Glorious Revolution and sat in the Convention of Estates of Scotland. He was appointed Lord Justice General of Scotland in 1689, holding the office until his death, and was re-appointed a privy counsellor by William III in 1690.

History The Giant Swing was constructed in 1784 in front of the Devasathan shrine by King Rama I. During the reign of Rama II the swing ceremony was discontinued as the swing had become structurally damaged by lightning. In 1920 it was renovated and moved to its current location in order to make space for a gas plant. The ceremony was again performed until 1935, when it was discontinued after several fatal accidents. The last renovations were done in 1959, and after 45 years of exposure to the elements the wooden pillars were showing signs of serious damage. A major reconstruction began in April 2005. Six teak tree trunks were used. The two used for the main structure of the swing are over 3.5 m in circumference and over 30m in height. The remaining four are used for support and are 2.30 m in circumference and 20 m in height.Daily News - Manager Online The swing was taken down in late October 2006 and the work finished in December of the same year. The rebuilt swing was dedicated in royal ceremonies presided over by King Bhumibol Adulyadej in September 2007. The timbers of the original swing are preserved in the Bangkok National Museum.

Swing ceremony An annual swinging ceremony known as Triyampavai-Tripavai was held at Giant Swings of major cities until 1935, when it was abolished for safety reasons. The name of the ceremony was derived from the names of two Tamil language Hindu chants: Thiruvempavai (a Shaivite hymn by Manikkavasakar) and Thiruppavai (a Vaishnavite hymn by Andal). Among Thai people, the ceremony was popularly known as Lo Jin Ja or Lo-Chin-Cha (\\"pulling the swing\\"). It is known that Tamil verses from Thiruvempavai — poet pratu sivalai (\\"opening the portals of Shiva's home\\") — were recited at this ceremony, as well as the coronation ceremony of the Thai king. According to T.P. Meenakshisundaram, the name of the festival indicates that Thiruppavai might have been recited as well. According to an ancient Hindu epic, after Brahma created the world he sent Shiva to look after it. When Shiva descended to the earth, Naga serpents wrapped around the mountains in order to keep the earth in place. After Shiva found the earth solid, the Nagas moved to the seas in celebration. The Swing Ceremony was a re-enactment of this. The pillars of the Giant Swing represented the mountains, while the circular base of the swing represented the earth and the seas. In the ceremony Brahmins would swing, trying to grab a bag of coins placed on one of the pillars.

Kramer attended the University of Michigan from 1953 to 1957, winning a total of nine varsity letters in football, basketball, and track. Playing at left end for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1954 to 1956, he was selected as a consensus first-team All-American in 1955 and a unanimous first-team All- American in 1956. His jersey (#87) was retired after Kramer's senior year, and he was inducted into both the College Football Hall of Fame and the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1978. Kramer was selected by the Green Bay Packers as the fourth pick in the 1957 NFL Draft and played for the Packers for seven seasons (1957, 1959–1964). He was a key player on coach Vince Lombardi's first NFL championship teams in 1961 and 1962. Kramer was selected as a first-team All-NFL player in 1962 after catching 37 passes for 555 yards and seven touchdowns. He also played three seasons for the Detroit Lions from 1965 to 1967. Early life Born in Girard, Kansas, Kramer moved to East Detroit, Michigan (now Eastpointe) at age five. He attended East Detroit High School where he was an all-state player in football, basketball and track in high school. He competed in the shot put and long jump in track. In December 1952, Kramer was named as an end on the United Press All-Michigan football team. University of Michigan Kramer tackling Ohio State's Jim Roseboro, 1956 Kramer enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1953. He was a three-sport athlete (football, basketball, and track) and led both the football and basketball teams in scoring for two years. Altogether, Kramer won a total of nine varsity letters in his three sports — the maximum number possible, as freshmen did not have athletic eligibility at the time. =Football= Kramer played college football at the end position (both defensive and offensive) for the Michigan Woverines from 1954 through 1956. As a 19-year-old sophomore, Kramer started all nine games at left end for the 1954 team that finished the season ranked #15 in the final AP Poll. He was the leading receiver for the Wolverines with 23 catches for 303 yards and two touchdowns.(to retrieve information for a particular season, go to \\"Games & Totals by Season\\" and select the year for which statistics are to be retrieved) At the end of the 1954 season, he was selected as a first-team All- Big Ten player. As a junior in 1955, Kramer started six games at left end and Michigan finished 12th in the final AP Poll. Kramer set a Michigan record with three touchdown passes in a game against Missouri in 1955. For the season as a whole, he caught 12 passes for 224 yards and four touchdowns, and he was selected as a consensus first-team end on the 1955 College Football All- America Team. Kramer had his best collegiate season as a senior, starting all nine games in 1956 and the Wolverines ended at seventh in the final AP Poll. Kramer caught 18 passes for 353 yards and two touchdowns in 1956. At the end of the season, Kramer was an consensus first-team All-American. Following Kramer's senior year, Michigan retired his jersey number 87 -- one of only five numbers in school history to be retired. In three years at Michigan, Kramer caught 53 passes for 880 yards and eight touchdowns. He was also known as an outstanding tackler and blocker. Bennie Oosterbaan, Kramer's football coach at Michigan, described his blocking and tackling ability as his most valuable asset. Oosterbaan said this of his star player: > \\"To top off his marvelous physical gifts of size and speed and strength, > plus an uncanny coordination, Kramer was one of the fiercest competitors > I've ever seen. Nothing was impossible for him — the impossible was only a > challenge.\\" Kramer also handled kicking and punting duties for Michigan. He handled 31 punts for a 40.6 yard average, kicked two field goals, and successfully converted 43 of 51 extra point attempts. =Basketball= Kramer also excelled in basketball. He played at the center position and was selected as the basketball team's most valuable player as a junior. As basketball team captain, he was third-team All-Big Ten in 1957 after being second-team All-Big Ten in both 1955 and 1956. During his junior year, he averaged 20.4 points per game over a 22-game season and is a member of the career 1,000-point club. He held the Michigan career scoring record of 1,119 points from 1957 until it was broken by John Tidwell in 1961. He was a fifth round pick in the 1957 NBA draft (34th overall), selected by the Detroit Pistons. Kramer was a two-sport professional athlete. He played in the Midwest Professional Basketball League for two seasons. Kramer played for the Battle Creek Warriors in 1961-1962, alongside former Michigan teammates M.C. Burton and John Tidwell. https://www.nasljerseys.com/EBA/Rosters/MBL- NABL/Warriors_EBA_Rosters.htm#1961. He and Burton then played for the Toledo Tartans in 1962-1963. NFL careerGreen Bay Packers= Kramer was the fourth overall selection in the 1957 NFL Draft, picked by the Green Bay Packers. Kramer also received an offer in February 1957 to play with the all- star basketball team that toured with the Harlem Globetrotters; he rejected the offer to play professional basketball. As a rookie for the Packers in 1957, Kramer appeared in 11 games and caught 28 passes for 337 yards. He missed the entire 1958 season due to service in the U.S. Air Force, and the Packers had the worst record in the league at 1–10–1. Kramer returned to the Packers in 1959, but caught no passes that year and only four passes during the 1960 season. Teammate Paul Hornung later described Kramer's evolution after Vince Lombardi arrived in 1959: > \\"[O]ne real special case was Ron Kramer. He came to us, Ron did, with an > I-don't-give-a-damn attitude. He had great ability and great confidence in > it but he just didn't use it.

He became an integral part of Vince Lombardi's 1961 and 1962 teams that won the Packers' first NFL championships since 1944. In the 1961 NFL Championship Game, a 37-0 win for the Packer over the New York Giants, Kramer was the leading receiver, catching four passes for 80 yards and two touchdowns. In addition to his talent as a receiver, Kramer's talent as a blocker was an integral part of the famed \\"Packers sweep.\\" =Detroit Lions= Kramer played out his contract option with the Packers and, as a free agent, signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Lions in August 1965. The Lions were required to compensate the Packers with a first- round draft choice in 1966. Kramer had asked to be traded to the Lions so he could be closer to his wife and children. Teammate Jerry Kramer recalled, \\"He asked Coach Lombardi to trade him because he was trying to save his marriage.\\" Kramer played three seasons for the Lions at the tight end position from 1965 to 1967. He appeared in 39 games for the Lions, 13 as a starter. In his first two seasons with the Lions, Kramer caught 55 passes for 638 yards and a touchdown. During the 1967 season, Kramer was slowed by injuries and caught only four passes for 40 yards in 11 games. In July 1968, the Lions gave Kramer his unconditional release. Three weeks later, Kramer announced that, despite receiving offers to play for several other teams, he was resigning from football to assume a position as vice president of Paragon Steel Corp. in Detroit. Kramer later described his years with the Lions as \\"awful\\" and called head coach Harry Gilmer \\"the dumbest guy I ever met.\\" =Career statistics= In 10 NFL seasons, Kramer appeared in 128 games and totaled 229 receptions for 3,272 yards and 16 touchdowns.

Kramer received numerous honors and awards, including the following: * In 1971, Kramer was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. * In 1975, Kramer was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. * In 1978, Kramer was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame . * Also in 1978, Kramer became one of the first seven individuals inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. * In 1981, Kramer was named as a recipient of the NCAA's Silver Anniversary Award in recognition of significant professional and civic contributions spanning 25 years after completion of his college eligibility. * In 1999, Sports Illustrated published a list of \\"The 50 Greatest Sports Figures From Michigan\\" (in all sports), and ranked Kramer seventh on the list behind such noted athletes as Joe Louis, Magic Johnson, Charlie Gehringer and Bennie Oosterbaan. Kramer died in September 2010 at age 75. On September 15, 2012, Kramer was recognized as a Michigan Football Legend and his jersey (#87) was unretired and given to Brandon Moore. Each player honored with the No. 87 jersey will wear a patch over the left upper chest honoring Kramer, and dress at a locker labeled with a plaque bearing his name and time of tenure at Michigan. In 2019, despite not being in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was chosen as a finalist for the NFL's 100th Anniversary Team.Tight end finalists announced for NFL All-Time Team See also * List of Michigan Wolverines football All-Americans * University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor ReferencesExternal links * * Bentley Library biography and photograph of Kramer * * Category:1935 births Category:2010 deaths Category:American men's basketball players Category:American football ends Category:American football tight ends Category:Detroit Pistons draft picks Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:Michigan Wolverines football players Category:Michigan Wolverines men's basketball players Category:Michigan Wolverines men's track and field athletes Category:All- American college football players Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Western Conference Pro Bowl players Category:People from Girard, Kansas Category:People from Eastpointe, Michigan Category:Players of American football from Michigan Category:Basketball players from Michigan ","title":"Ron Kramer"},{"id":"2009009","text":"150px Luigi Illica (9 May 1857 – 16 December 1919) was an Italian librettist who wrote for Giacomo Puccini (usually with Giuseppe Giacosa), Pietro Mascagni, Alfredo Catalani, Umberto Giordano, Baron Alberto Franchetti and other important Italian composers. His most famous opera libretti are those for La Bohème, Tosca, Madama Butterfly and Andrea Chénier. Luigi Illica Illica was born at Castell'Arquato. His personal life sometimes imitated his libretti. The reason he is always photographed with his head slightly turned is because he lost his right ear in a duel over a woman. When silent films based on Illica's operas were made, his name appeared in large letters on advertisements because distributors could only guarantee that his stories would be used, and not that they would be accompanied by the music of the appropriate composer. As a playwright of considerable quality, he is today remembered through one of Italy's oldest awards, the Luigi Illica International Prize founded in 1961, which goes to world famous opera singers, opera conductors, directors and authors. The Award is now awarded every two years and alternates with the Illica Opera Stage International Competition, which offers prizes and debut opportunities to young singers.

Overview  Archaeological plan can either take the form of * a \\"multi context\\" plan, which is drawn with many contexts on it to show relationships between these features as part of some phase, or * alternatively a single context plan with a single feature is drawn . Excavated features are drawn in three dimensions with the help of drawing conventions such as hachures. Single context planning developed by the Museum of London has become the professional norm. The basic advantage of single context planning is context plans draw on \\"transparent perma-trace paper\\" can be overlaid for re-interpretation at a later date. Multi-context Plans as opposed to single context plans can be made of complete sites, trenches or individual features. In the United Kingdom, the scale of the plans is usually 1:20. They are linked to the site recording system by the inclusion of known grid points and height readings, taken with a dumpy level or a total station (see surveying). Excavation of a site by the removal of human made deposits in the reverse order they were created is the preferred method of excavation and is referred to as stratigraphic area excavation \\"in plan\\" as opposed to excavation \\"in section\\". Plan and section drawings have an interpretive function as well as being part of the recording system, because the draughts-person makes conscious decisions about what should be included or emphasised.  Archaeological plan topics  Fig 2. edge of context conventions Fig 3. Cut planning hachures = The grid = It is common and good practice on excavations to lay out a grid of 5m squares so as to facilitate planning. This grid is marked out on-site with grid pegs that form the baselines for tapes and other planning tools to aid the drawing of plans. It is also common practice that planning is done for each context on a separate piece of perma-trace that conforms to these 5m grid squares. This is part of the single context recording system (see Fig 1.) The site grid should be tied into a national geomatic database such as the Ordnance survey = Planning drawing conventions = Archaeological planners use various symbols to denote characteristics of features and contexts and while conventions vary depending on practitioner, the following are representative: =Pre-excavation and base plans = On sites with little stratigraphic depth, a pre-excavation multi-context plan is sometimes made of all visible features before any excavation is carried out. This helps in planning strategy since problems of stratigraphy on rural sites are minimal as features often cut into the natural minimizing issues of inter-cutting features. Conversely, planning a multi- context urban site is difficult to achieve on a multi-context plan as the features and deposits when planned will obscure each other on the same planning sheet.  Critics of pre-excavation planning  Pre-excavation plans have been critiqued as being of limited use on urban or deeply stratified sites and have also been attacked in professional archaeology where they have been described as a misused tool of the unscrupulous operators to give the impression the archaeological record for a given site has been dealt with adequately. This critical point of view contends, that comparisons between pre and post-excavation plans can demonstrate that a site has not been comprehensively excavated on the basis of a pre-ex plan alone. In many cases there is a pronounced difference between the two phases of planning. Although many features may be visible at ground level following machining, it is often the case that the true limits of features are not so initially discernible until the area of the feature is fully cleaned and subsequently excavated revealing further features and relationships lower in the sequence.

It is the capital of the Western Highlands Province and is located in the large fertile Wahgi Valley in central mainland Papua New Guinea, at an elevation of . The Highlands Highway is the main arterial route to connect Mount Hagen with the coastal cities of Lae and Madang. The city is named after the old eroded volcano Mount Hagen, located about to the north-west. The volcano was named after the German colonial officer (1859-1897).  History  The plane, 'Canberra', before the 1933 expedition to Mount Hagen In 1933 Mick Leahy, brother Dan Leahy, and government officer Jim Taylor conducted an aerial reconnaissance of the highlands and discovered the huge and heavily populated Wahgi Valley. A short time later they walked in with a well supplied patrol and became the first westerners to come into contact with the tribes that are now in the location of Mount Hagen. The first patrol built an airstrip at Kelua, a short distance from modern Mount Hagen. From 1934, a new airstrip, the 'Mogei drome' or 'Mogai Aerodrome', was located on a site where the future town was formed. The first flight arrived here on 1 April 1934, piloted by Bob Gurney, with the first airmail leaving the next day. Later, this airstrip was to become the main street passing by China town and the airstrip (current) was moved 15 minutes out of town.  Culture  Each year, Mount Hagen hosts the Mount Hagen Cultural Show, one of the largest cultural events in Papua New Guinea. Various regional, provincial, even national tribal dance groups gather to celebrate their cultural heritage in the form of sing- sing. It is also one of the biggest tourist attractions of the country. Its near the Baiyer District which hosts the biggest collection of birds and wildlife in Papua New Guinea, the Baiyer River Sanctuary. Although locals do not recommend visiting the sanctuary as the road through the Baiyer District is prone to many highway robberies. Traditional culture and beliefs remain strong in Mount Hagen and its surrounds. In 2009, and again 2013, local women were reportedly burned alive after being accused of sorcery. Recent thinking links the upsurge in such accusations with poor development outcomes in Papua New Guinea and the erosion of social capital through fear and mistrust.  Transport  Mount Hagen Airport is located at Kagamuga, a satellite town 15 minutes drive from the centre of Mount Hagen. It is an international airport although flights into and out of it are not always available to the public. The airport altitude is above sea level. Currently, Hevilift operates a charter service using ATR-42 and Twin Otter aircraft from Cairns, Queensland, for mine workers at the Porgera Gold Mine in Enga Province. Asia Pacific Airlines also fly Dash 8s regularly to Tabubil, their hub, to service the Ok Tedi Mine. Air Niugini also service Mount Hagen, with regular Fokker 100 and Dash 8 services to destinations such as Port Moresby, Moro and Cairns. PNG Air also operate regular services to and from Mt Hagen to Port Moresby, Tabubil , Kiunga and Wewak. Near the airport is Airport Hotel. From time to time, the combination of altitude, midday temperatures and runway length restrict takeoff weights for domestic flights out of Mount Hagen. Mount Hagen is connected via the Highlands Highway to the city of Lae and other provincial capitals such as Madang, Goroka, Wabag, Mendi and Kundiawa. The road between Mount Hagen and all these centers is theoretically sealed, although frequent landslides and general deterioration can lead to parts of the road becoming unsealed or rough. You can travel from Mt Hagen along the Highlands Highway by using the popular PMV buses which operate as taxis or hire a car from the numerous hire car companies within Mt Hagen. Because of the difficult road conditions of the Highlands Highway, it is advisable to use four-wheel drive cars.

It is the traditional capital of ka hima Sohra (Khasi tribal kingdom). Cherrapunji has often been credited as being the wettest place on Earth, but for now nearby Mawsynram currently holds that distinction. It still holds the all-time record for the most rainfall in a calendar month and in a year, however: it received in July 1861 and between 1 August 1860 and 31 July 1861.  History  The history of the Khasi people – native inhabitants of Cherrapunji – may be traced from the early part of the 16th century. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, these people were ruled by their tribal 'Syiems (rajas or chiefs) of Khyriem' in the Khasi Hills. The Khasi hills came under British authority in 1883 with the submission of the last of the important Syiem, Tirot Sing Syiem. The main pivot on which the entire superstructure of Khasi society rests is the matrilineal system. The original name for this town was Sohra (soh-ra), which was pronounced \\"Cherra\\" by the British. This name eventually evolved into a temporary name, Cherrapunji, meaning 'land of oranges', which was first used by tourists from other parts of India. It has again been renamed to its original form, Sohra. 450px Despite abundant rainfall, Cherrapunji faces an acute water shortage and the inhabitants often have to trek very long distances to obtain potable water. Irrigation is hampered due to excessive rain washing away the topsoil as a result of human encroachment into the forests. Recent developments of rain-water harvesting techniques in the area have greatly helped the town and its neighbouring villages. There is a monument to David Scott (British Administrator in NE India, 1802–31) in the town's cemetery.  Geography  It has an average elevation of and sits on a plateau in the southern part of the Khasi Hills, facing the plains of Bangladesh. The plateau rises 660 meters above the surrounding valleys. Soils on the plateau are poor owing to deforestation and washout caused by heavy rainfall. Owing to winter droughts, the vegetation in this location is even xerophytic in spite of the town's fame as an extremely wet place. Additional pressure on local ecosystems is created by the rapid increase of the population — from a Sohra-area population of 7,000 in 1960, it grew to over 10,000 by 2000. The valleys around Cherrapunji, however, are covered with lush and very diverse vegetation, containing numerous endemic species of plants, including Meghalaya subtropical forests. There are some interesting living root bridges in villages near Cherrapunji like the Umshiang root bridge, Mawsaw root bridge, Ritymmen root bridge and the Double Decker woot bridge at Nongriat village. The Shillong Plateau is an uplifted horst-like feature, bounded by the E-W Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) to the North, the N-S Jamuna fault in the west, and the NW-SE kopilli fracture zone in the east. =Climate= View of Bangladesh plains from Cherrapunji Cherrapunji has a mild subtropical highland climate (Köppen Cwb), with monsoonal influences typical of India. The city's annual rainfall average stands at . This figure places it behind only nearby Mawsynram, Meghalaya, whose average is . Cherrapunji receives both the southwest and northeast monsoonal winds, giving it a single monsoon season. It lies on the windward side of the Khasi Hills, so the resulting orographic lift enhances precipitation. In the winter months it receives the northeast monsoon showers that travel down the Brahmaputra valley. The driest months are November, December, January and February. Temperatures average in January and in August, and the annual mean is Cherrapunji holds two Guinness world records for receiving the maximum amount of rainfall in a single year: of rainfall between August 1860 and July 1861 and for receiving the maximum amount of rainfall in a single month: in July 1861.Guinness World Records 2005; pg-51 =Causes of high rainfall= Nohkalikai falls Seven Sisters' falls Cherrapunji receives rains from the Bay of Bengal arm of the Indian summer monsoon. The monsoon clouds fly unhindered over the plains of Bangladesh for about 400 km. Thereafter, they hit the Khasi Hills which rise abruptly from the plains to a height of about 1,370 m above mean sea level within 2 to 5 km. The geography of the hills with many deep valley channels encompassing the low-flying (150–300 m) moisture-laden clouds from a wide area converges over Cherrapunji. The winds push the rain clouds through these gorges and up the steep slopes. The rapid ascent of the clouds into the upper atmosphere hastens the cooling and helps vapours to condense. Most of the rain is the result of air being lifted as a large body of water vapour. The extreme amount of rainfall is perhaps the best-known feature of orographic rain in northeastern India. Occasionally, cloudbursts can occur in one part of Cherrapunji while other areas may be totally or relatively dry, reflecting the high spatial variability of the rainfall. Atmospheric humidity is extremely high during the peak monsoon period. The major part of the rainfall at Cherrapunji can be attributed to the orographic features. When the clouds are blown over the hills from the south, they are funneled through the valley. The clouds strike Cherrapunji perpendicularly and the low flying clouds are pushed up the steep slopes. It is not surprising to find that the heaviest rainfalls occur when the winds blow directly on the Khasi Hills. A notable feature of monsoon rain at Cherrapunji is that most of it falls in the morning. This could be partly due to two air masses coming together. During the monsoon months, the prevailing winds along the Brahmaputra valley generally blow from the east or the northeast, but the winds over Meghalaya are from the south. These two winds systems usually come together in the vicinity of the Khasi Hills. Apparently, the winds that are trapped in the valley at night begin their upward ascent only after they are warmed during the day. This partially explains the frequency of morning rainfall. Apart from orographic features, atmospheric convection plays an important role during the monsoon and the period just preceding it. Demographics As of the 2011 Census in India, Cherrapunji had a population of 10,086, with males 48.75% of the total population and females 51.25%. It has an average literacy rate of 74%, equal to the national average of 74.5%, with a male literacy rate of 72.4% and a female one of 73.9%. Culture Khasi children (1944)The locals living in and around Cherrapunji are known as Khasis. It is a matrilineal culture. After the wedding, the husband of the youngest daughter goes to live with his wife's family, who own the property of the family, while others live on their own getting a bit of the share. The children take on the surname of the mother.Cherrapunjee Vacation Resort website Cherrapunji is also famous for its living bridges. Over hundreds of years the people have developed techniques for growing roots of trees into large bridges. The process takes 10 to 15 years and the bridges typically last hundreds of years, the oldest ones in use being over 500 years old. Education Sohra Government College is the only general degree college in the town. Most students move to the state capital for college degrees. Schools, like the Ramkrishna Mission which are independent and government-run schools like the Thomas Jones School have been set up in and around the town.

The regulator, also known as a \\"cutoff\\", models our lack of knowledge about physics at unobserved scales (e.g. scales of small size or large energy levels). It compensates for (and requires) the possibility that \\"new physics\\" may be discovered at those scales which the present theory is unable to model, while enabling the current theory to give accurate predictions as an \\"effective theory\\" within its intended scale of use. It is distinct from renormalization, another technique to control infinities without assuming new physics, by adjusting for self- interaction feedback. Regularization was for many decades controversial even amongst its inventors, as it combines physical and epistemological claims into the same equations. However, it is now well understood and has proven to yield useful, accurate predictions. Overview Regularization procedures deal with infinite, divergent, and nonsensical expressions by introducing an auxiliary concept of a regulator (for example, the minimal distance \\\\epsilon in space which is useful, in case the divergences arise from short-distance physical effects). The correct physical result is obtained in the limit in which the regulator goes away (in our example, \\\\epsilon\\\\to 0), but the virtue of the regulator is that for its finite value, the result is finite. However, the result usually includes terms proportional to expressions like 1/ \\\\epsilon which are not well-defined in the limit \\\\epsilon\\\\to 0. Regularization is the first step towards obtaining a completely finite and meaningful result; in quantum field theory it must be usually followed by a related, but independent technique called renormalization. Renormalization is based on the requirement that some physical quantities -- expressed by seemingly divergent expressions such as 1/ \\\\epsilon -- are equal to the observed values. Such a constraint allows one to calculate a finite value for many other quantities that looked divergent. The existence of a limit as ε goes to zero and the independence of the final result from the regulator are nontrivial facts. The underlying reason for them lies in universality as shown by Kenneth Wilson and Leo Kadanoff and the existence of a second order phase transition. Sometimes, taking the limit as ε goes to zero is not possible. This is the case when we have a Landau pole and for nonrenormalizable couplings like the Fermi interaction. However, even for these two examples, if the regulator only gives reasonable results for \\\\epsilon \\\\gg 1/\\\\Lambda and we are working with scales of the order of 1/\\\\Lambda', regulators with 1/\\\\Lambda \\\\ll \\\\epsilon \\\\ll 1/\\\\Lambda' still give pretty accurate approximations. The physical reason why we can't take the limit of ε going to zero is the existence of new physics below Λ. It is not always possible to define a regularization such that the limit of ε going to zero is independent of the regularization. In this case, one says that the theory contains an anomaly. Anomalous theories have been studied in great detail and are often founded on the celebrated Atiyah–Singer index theorem or variations thereof (see, for example, the chiral anomaly).  Classical physics example  The problem of infinities first arose in the classical electrodynamics of point particles in the 19th and early 20th century. The mass of a charged particle should include the mass–energy in its electrostatic field (electromagnetic mass). Assume that the particle is a charged spherical shell of radius . The mass–energy in the field is :m_\\\\mathrm{em} = \\\\int {1\\\\over 2}E^2 \\\\, dV = \\\\int_{r_e}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( {q\\\\over 4\\\\pi r^2} \\\\right)^2 4\\\\pi r^2 \\\\, dr = {q^2 \\\\over 8\\\\pi r_e}, which becomes infinite as . This implies that the point particle would have infinite inertia, making it unable to be accelerated. Incidentally, the value of that makes m_{\\\\mathrm{em}} equal to the electron mass is called the classical electron radius, which (setting q = e and restoring factors of and \\\\varepsilon_0) turns out to be :r_e = {e^2 \\\\over 4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 m_{\\\\mathrm{e}} c^2} = \\\\alpha {\\\\hbar\\\\over m_{\\\\mathrm{e}} c} \\\\approx 2.8 \\\\times 10^{-15}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{m}. where \\\\alpha \\\\approx 1/137 is the fine structure constant, and \\\\hbar/m_{\\\\mathrm{e}} c is the Compton wavelength of the electron. Regularization: This process shows that the physical theory originally used breaks down at small scales. It shows that the electron cannot in fact be a point particle, and that some kind of additional new physics (in this case, a finite radius) is needed to explain systems below a certain scale. This same argument will appear in other renormalization problems: a theory holds in some domain but can be seen to break down and require new physics at other scales in order to avoid infinities. (Another way to avoid the infinity but while retaining the point nature of the particle would be to postulate a small additional dimension over which the particle could 'spread out' rather than over 3D space; this is a motivation for string theory.) (See also renormalization for an alternative way to remove infinities from this classical problem, assuming self-interactions rather than the existence of unknown new physics.) Specific types Specific types of regularization procedures include *Dimensional regularization *Pauli–Villars regularization *Lattice regularization *Zeta function regularization *Causal regularizationScharf, G.: Finite Quantum Electrodynamics: The Causal Approach, Springer 1995. *Hadamard regularization Realistic regularizationConceptual problem= Perturbative predictions by quantum field theory about quantum scattering of elementary particles, implied by a corresponding Lagrangian density, are computed using the Feynman rules, a regularization method to circumvent ultraviolet divergences so as to obtain finite results for Feynman diagrams containing loops, and a renormalization scheme. Regularization method results in regularized n-point Green's functions (propagators), and a suitable limiting procedure (a renormalization scheme) then leads to perturbative S-matrix elements. These are independent of the particular regularization method used, and enable one to model perturbatively the measurable physical processes (cross sections, probability amplitudes, decay widths and lifetimes of excited states). However, so far no known regularized n-point Green's functions can be regarded as being based on a physically realistic theory of quantum-scattering since the derivation of each disregards some of the basic tenets of conventional physics (e.g., by not being Lorentz-invariant, by introducing either unphysical particles with a negative metric or wrong statistics, or discrete space-time, or lowering the dimensionality of space-time, or some combination thereof). So the available regularization methods are understood as formalistic technical devices, devoid of any direct physical meaning. In addition, there are qualms about renormalization. For a history and comments on this more than half-a-century old open conceptual problem, see e.g.L. M.Brown, editor, Renormalization (Springer-Verlag, New York 1993). =Pauli's conjecture= As it seems that the vertices of non-regularized Feynman series adequately describe interactions in quantum scattering, it is taken that their ultraviolet divergences are due to the asymptotic, high-energy behavior of the Feynman propagators. So it is a prudent, conservative approach to retain the vertices in Feynman series, and modify only the Feynman propagators to create a regularized Feynman series. This is the reasoning behind the formal Pauli–Villars covariant regularization by modification of Feynman propagators through auxiliary unphysical particles, cf. and representation of physical reality by Feynman diagrams. In 1949 Pauli conjectured there is a realistic regularization, which is implied by a theory that respects all the established principles of contemporary physics. So its propagators (i) do not need to be regularized, and (ii) can be regarded as such a regularization of the propagators used in quantum field theories that might reflect the underlying physics. The additional parameters of such a theory do not need to be removed (i.e. the theory needs no renormalization) and may provide some new information about the physics of quantum scattering, though they may turn out experimentally to be negligible. By contrast, any present regularization method introduces formal coefficients that must eventually be disposed of by renormalization. =Opinions= Paul Dirac was persistently, extremely critical about procedures of renormalization. In 1963, he wrote, \\"… in the renormalization theory we have a theory that has defied all the attempts of the mathematician to make it sound. I am inclined to suspect that the renormalization theory is something that will not survive in the future,…\\" He further observed that \\"One can distinguish between two main procedures for a theoretical physicist. One of them is to work from the experimental basis ... The other procedure is to work from the mathematical basis. One examines and criticizes the existing theory. One tries to pin-point the faults in it and then tries to remove them. The difficulty here is to remove the faults without destroying the very great successes of the existing theory.\\" Abdus Salam remarked in 1972, \\"Field-theoretic infinities first encountered in Lorentz's computation of electron have persisted in classical electrodynamics for seventy and in quantum electrodynamics for some thirty-five years. These long years of frustration have left in the subject a curious affection for the infinities and a passionate belief that they are an inevitable part of nature; so much so that even the suggestion of a hope that they may after all be circumvented - and finite values for the renormalization constants computed - is considered irrational.\\" However, in Gerard ’t Hooft’s opinion, \\"History tells us that if we hit upon some obstacle, even if it looks like a pure formality or just a technical complication, it should be carefully scrutinized. Nature might be telling us something, and we should find out what it is.\\"G. ’t Hooft, In Search of the Ultimate Building Blocks (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1997). The difficulty with a realistic regularization is that so far there is none, although nothing could be destroyed by its bottom-up approach; and there is no experimental basis for it. =Minimal realistic regularization= Considering distinct theoretical problems, Dirac in 1963 suggested: \\"I believe separate ideas will be needed to solve these distinct problems and that they will be solved one at a time through successive stages in the future evolution of physics. At this point I find myself in disagreement with most physicists. They are inclined to think one master idea will be discovered that will solve all these problems together. I think it is asking too much to hope that anyone will be able to solve all these problems together. One should separate them one from another as much as possible and try to tackle them separately. And I believe the future development of physics will consist of solving them one at a time, and that after any one of them has been solved there will still be a great mystery about how to attack further ones.\\" According to Dirac, \\"Quantum electrodynamics is the domain of physics that we know most about, and presumably it will have to be put in order before we can hope to make any fundamental progress with other field theories, although these will continue to develop on the experimental basis.\\" Dirac’s two preceding remarks suggest that we should start searching for a realistic regularization in the case of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, starting with the original QED Lagrangian density. The path-integral formulation provides the most direct way from the Lagrangian density to the corresponding Feynman series in its Lorentz-invariant form. The free-field part of the Lagrangian density determines the Feynman propagators, whereas the rest determines the vertices. As the QED vertices are considered to adequately describe interactions in QED scattering, it makes sense to modify only the free-field part of the Lagrangian density so as to obtain such regularized Feynman series that the Lehmann–Symanzik–Zimmermann reduction formula provides a perturbative S-matrix that: (i) is Lorentz-invariant and unitary; (ii) involves only the QED particles; (iii) depends solely on QED parameters and those introduced by the modification of the Feynman propagators—for particular values of these parameters it is equal to the QED perturbative S-matrix; and (iv) exhibits the same symmetries as the QED perturbative S-matrix. Let us refer to such a regularization as the minimal realistic regularization, and start searching for the corresponding, modified free-field parts of the QED Lagrangian density. Transport theoretic approach According to Bjorken and Drell, it would make physical sense to sidestep ultraviolet divergences by using more detailed description than can be provided by differential field equations. And Feynman noted about the use of differential equations: \\"... for neutron diffusion it is only an approximation that is good when the distance over which we are looking is large compared with the mean free path. If we looked more closely, we would see individual neutrons running around.\\" And then he wondered, \\"Could it be that the real world consists of little X-ons which can be seen only at very tiny distances? And that in our measurements we are always observing on such a large scale that we can’t see these little X-ons, and that is why we get the differential equations? ... Are they [therefore] also correct only as a smoothed-out imitation of a really much more complicated microscopic world?\\"R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton and M. Sands: The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. II (Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass., 1965), Sec.12–7. Already in 1938, Heisenberg proposed that a quantum field theory can provide only an idealized, large-scale description of quantum dynamics, valid for distances larger than some fundamental length, expected also by Bjorken and Drell in 1965. Feynman's preceding remark provides a possible physical reason for its existence; either that or it is just another way of saying the same thing (there is a fundamental unit of distance) but having no new information. String theory The need for regularization terms in any quantum field theory of quantum gravity is a major motivation for physics beyond the standard model. Infinities of the non-gravitational forces in QFT can be controlled via renormalization only but additional regularization - and hence new physics—is required uniquely for gravity. The regularizers model, and work around, the break down of QFT at small scales and thus show clearly the need for some other theory to come into play beyond QFT at these scales. A. Zee (Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell, 2003) considers this to be a benefit of the regularization framework—theories can work well in their intended domains but also contain information about their own limitations and point clearly to where new physics is needed.

It is one of the five languages defined by IEC 61131-3 standard. The SFC standard is defined as, Preparation of function charts for control systems, and was based on GRAFCET (itself based on binary Petri nets). It can be used to program processes that can be split into steps. Basic Batch SFC, with important elements labelled Main components of SFC are: * Steps with associated actions; * Transitions with associated logic conditions; * Directed links between steps and transitions. Steps in an SFC diagram can be active or inactive. Actions are only executed for active steps. A step can be active for one of two motives: * It is an initial step as specified by the programmer. * It was activated during a scan cycle and not deactivated since. Steps are activated when all steps above it are active and the connecting transition is superable (i.e. its associated condition is true). When a transition is passed, all steps above are deactivated at once and after all steps below are activated at once. Actions associated with steps can be of several types, the most relevant ones being Continuous (N), Set (S) and Reset (R). Apart from the obvious meaning of Set and Reset, an N action ensures that its target variable is set to 1 as long as the step is active. An SFC rule states that if two steps have an N action on the same target, the variable must never be reset to 0. It is also possible to insert LD (Ladder Diagram) actions inside an SFC program (and this is the standard way, for instance, to work on integer variables). SFC is an inherently parallel language in that multiple control flows — Program Organization Units (POUs) in the standard's parlance — can be active at once. Non-standard extensions to the language include macroactions: i.e. actions inside a program unit that influence the state of another program unit. The most relevant such macroaction is \\"forcing\\", in which a POU can decide the active steps of another POU.

Browne is a former U.S. Army officer. He served in the postwar occupation military government of Germany, as a Major in the Third Army. He was involved in the recovery of German documents at the end of World War II. Report on recovery of Nazi documents Browne was the author of a 1946 U.S. Army Report: \\"Covering the locating, safeguarding, collecting and disposition of NSDAP records during period 19 September 1945 to 21 January 1946, by the Office of Military Government for Regierungsbezirk Oberbayern.\\" The report, which is lodged in the U.S. National Archives, describes the discovery of the Nazi Party's worldwide membership card files in May 1945 by U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps personnel. The report states, \\"An estimated 68,000 kilos of Party records and documents of Reichsleitung SA were discovered by agents of the 45th CIC Det in a paper mill at Freimann (X-8763). Included among the papers were all Party membership cards with identification photos, documents relating to the Party, SA courts, and SA administration.\\" Six to seven million of these cards were moved to the Army's Munich headquarters, located in the \\"Reichfinanzhof\\" building (Reich Finance Court). Browne's report included a photo of these files. Browne came upon the remaining files at the paper mill in September 1945. He alerted General Eisenhower's Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), which immediately ordered a major task force to organize and catalog the files. Browne's discovery received worldwide press coverage. The files subsequently became the heart of the collections of the Berlin Document Center (BDC), and were instrumental in the Allied Denazification of Germany, and in the Nuremberg War Crimes trials. Role of CIC Agent Michel Thomas In 2000, \\"Test of Courage\\" a biography of former CIC Agent Michel Thomas gave an account of his rescue of the files in May 1945. When Thomas's account was questioned by a Los Angeles Times reporter in 2001, Thomas sued the reporter and the paper for defamation, and commissioned a private investigator to research this and other issues. The investigator's research led to Volume XXVI of The History of the Counter Intelligence Corps. This states that the first U.S. soldier to see the files in May 1945 was Counter Intelligence Corps Agent Francesco Quaranta.History of the Counter Intelligence Corps, Volume XXVI, excerpt at http://www.michelthomas.org However, when the investigator interviewed Quaranta's widow, she said he did not speak or read German and would not have understood what was on the cards, nor did he ever mention any role in the discovery of the files. As of 2002, only one other Agent survived from Thomas's unit, Mr. Walter Wimer. He stated in a sworn Declaration filed in Thomas's defamation suit that there were at most six German-speaking members of the unit, including himself and Thomas, and was unaware of any other agent who claimed a role in rescuing the files. Thomas also kept original Nazi documents that he found at the mill, including one bearing the original signature of Heinrich Himmler. In 2002, this evidence was submitted to Robert Wolfe, a leading expert on captured German war documents from the National Archives. Wolfe concluded that Thomas was the Counter Intelligence Corps Agent who originally rescued the files in May 1945.

It was established in the United States by five private sector organizations, dedicated to guiding executive management and government entities in relevant aspects of organizational governance, business ethics, internal control, business risk management, fraud and financial reports. COSO has established a common internal control model against which companies and organizations can evaluate their control systems. COSO has the support of five support organizations: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), American Accounting Association (AAA), Financial Executives International (FEI), Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) Organizational summary COSO was formed in 1985 to sponsor the National Fraudulent Financial Information Commission (the Treadway Commission). The Treadway Commission was originally sponsored and jointly funded by five major professional accounting associations and institutes based in the United States: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), American Accounting Association (AAA), Financial Executives International (FEI), Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and Institute of Management Accountants (IMA). The Treadway Commission recommended that the sponsoring organizations of the Commission work together to develop an integrated guidance on internal control. These five organizations formed what is now called the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The original president of the Treadway Commission was James C. Treadway, Jr., Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Paine Webber and former Commissioner of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. UU. Hence the popular name \\"Treadway Commission.\\" Robert B. Hirth, Jr. became the President of COSO at June 1, 2013. He held the position for 4.5 years. In February 1, 2018, Paul J. Sobel became the new president of COSO. History Due to the questionable practices of financing corporate political campaigns and corrupt foreign practices in the mid-1970s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Congress enacted reforms to the campaign finance law and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 that criminalized transnational bribery and required companies to implement internal control programs. In response, the Treadway Commission, a private sector initiative, was formed in 1985 to inspect, analyze and make recommendations on fraudulent corporate financial reports. The Treadway Commission studied the financial information system during the period from October 1985 to September 1987 and issued a report of findings and recommendations in October 1987, \\"Report of the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Information.\\"http://www.coso.org/Publications/NCFFR.pdf, \\"Report of the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Information\\", obtained on March 23, 2011. As a result of this initial report, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO)) was formed and retained Coopers & Lybrand, a large accounting firm, to study the problems and write a report on an integrated internal control framework. In September 1992, the four-volume report entitled \\"Internal control: integrated framework\\", \\" Internal control - Integrated framework \\", retrieved on March 23, 2011. was published by COSO and then published again with minor amendments in 1994. This report presented a common definition of internal control and provided a framework against which internal control systems can be evaluated and improved. This report is a standard that US companies use to assess their compliance with the FCPA. According to a survey conducted by the magazine \`\` CFO published in 2006, 82% of respondents said they used the COSO framework for internal controls. Other frameworks used by respondents included COBIT, AS2 (Audit Standard No. 2, PCAOB) and SAS 55/78 (AICPA).http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm / 5598405 / c_2984409 /? f = archives , \\"The Trouble with COSO\\", March 15, 2006, accessed March 23, 2011.  Internal Control - Integrated Framework Key concepts of the COSO framework= The COSO framework involves several key concepts: * Internal Control is a \\"process.\\" It is a means to an end, not an end in itself. * Internal control is carried out by \\"people.\\" It is not simply about policies, manuals and forms, but about people at all levels of an organization. * Internal control can be expected to provide only \\"reasonable security,\\" not absolute security, to the administration and directory of an entity. * Internal control is aimed at achieving \\"objectives\\" in one or more separate but overlapping categories. =Definition of internal control and framework objectives= The COSO framework defines internal control as a process, carried out by the board of directors, the administration and other personnel of an entity, designed to provide \\"reasonable security\\" with respect to the achievement of objectives in the following categories: * Effectiveness and efficiency of the 'operations' * Reliability of 'financial reports' * 'Compliance' with applicable laws and regulations =Five frame components= The COSO internal control framework consists of five interrelated components derived from the way in which the administration manages a business. 'According to COSO, these components provide an effective framework to describe and analyze the internal control system implemented in an organization' as required by financial regulations (see Securities Exchange Act of 1934,17 CFR Section 240 15d-15, obtained on March 23, 2011.) The five components are as follows: 'Control environment:' The control environment sets the tone of an organization, influencing the control consciousness of its people. It is the basis of all other components of internal control, providing discipline and structure. Factors in the control environment include integrity, ethical values, the operational style of administration, the delegation of authority systems, as well as the processes for managing and developing people in the organization. 'Risk assessment:' Each entity faces a variety of risks from external and internal sources that must be assessed. A prerequisite for risk assessment is the establishment of objectives and, therefore, risk assessment is the identification and analysis of risks relevant to the achievement of the assigned objectives. Risk assessment is a prerequisite for determining how risks should be managed. The four underlying principles related to risk assessment are that the organization should have clear objectives in order to be able to identify and assess the risks relating to those objectives; should determine how the risks should be managed; should consider the potential for fraudulent behavior; and should monitor changes that could impact internal controls. 'Control activities:' Control activities are the policies and procedures that help ensure that management directives are carried out. They help to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to address the risks that may hinder the achievement of the entity's objectives. Control activities occur throughout the organization, at all levels and in all functions. They include a range of activities as diverse as approvals, authorizations, verifications, reconciliations, operational performance reviews, asset safety and segregation of functions. 'Information and communication:' Information systems play a key role in internal control systems, as they produce reports, including operational, financial and compliance-related information, which make the operation and control of the business possible . In a broader sense, effective communication must ensure information flows down, across and up the organization. For example, the formalized procedures for individuals to report suspected fraud. Effective communication with external parties, such as customers, suppliers, regulators and shareholders on related political positions, must also be guaranteed. 'Monitoring' : Internal control systems must be monitored, a process that evaluates the quality of system performance over time. This is achieved through continuous monitoring activities or separate evaluations. Internal control deficiencies detected through these monitoring activities must be reported upstream and corrective measures must be taken to ensure continuous improvement of the system. =Limitations= Internal control involves human action, which introduces the possibility of errors in prosecution or trial. Internal control can also be overridden by collusion among employees (see separation of duties) or coercion by senior management. The magazine \`\` CFO reported that companies are struggling to apply the complex model provided by COSO. \\"One of the biggest problems: limiting internal audits to one of the three key objectives of the framework. In the COSO model, these objectives apply to five key components (control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication , and monitoring \\"Given the number of possible matrices, it is not surprising that the number of audits can get out of control.\\"http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/5598405/2/c_5620756, CFO Magazine , Accessed on March 23, 2011. CFO magazine continued to state that many organizations are creating their own risk and control matrix by taking the COSO model and modifying it to focus on the components that relate directly to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Business Risk Management  In 2001, COSO initiated a project and hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to develop a framework that administrations could easily use to evaluate and improve the business risk management of their organizations. High-profile commercial scandals and failures (e.g., Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, Peregrine Systems and WorldCom) generated calls to improve corporate governance and risk management. As a result, Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted. This law extends the long-standing requirement for public companies to maintain internal control systems, which requires management to certify and the independent auditor to certify the effectiveness of those systems. The Internal Control - Integrated Framework continues to serve as the \`\` widely accepted standard to meet those reporting requirements; however, in 2004 COSO published \\"Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework.\\"http://www.coso.org/Publications/ERM/COSO_ERM_ExecutiveSummary.pdf, \\"Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework\\", accessed March 23, 2011. COSO believes that this framework is expanded in internal control, providing a more robust and extensive approach to the broader issue of business risk management. = Four categories of business objectives = This business risk management framework is still aimed at achieving the objectives of an entity; However, the framework now includes four categories: * Strategic: high-level objectives, aligned and supporting their mission. * Operations: effective and efficient use of your resources. * Reports: reliability of reports * Compliance: compliance with applicable laws and regulations =Eight frame components= The eight components of business risk management encompass the five previous components of the Integrated Internal Control Framework while expanding the model to meet the growing demand for risk management: 'Internal environment': The internal environment encompasses the tone of an organization and establishes the basis of how risk is seen and addressed by the persons of an entity, including the risk management philosophy and risk appetite, integrity and ethical values, and the environment in which they operate. 'Setting objectives': The objectives must exist before management can identify potential events that affect its achievement. Business risk management ensures that management has implemented a process to establish objectives and that the chosen objectives support and align with the mission of the entity and are consistent with its appetite for risk. 'Event identification': Internal and external events that affect the achievement of the objectives of an entity must be identified, distinguishing between risks and opportunities. The opportunities are re-channeled into management strategy or goal-setting processes. 'Risk assessment': The risks are analyzed, considering the probability and impact, as a basis for determining how they should be managed. The risks are inherently and residually assessed. Post comments Record Saved Community 'Risk response:' Management selects risk responses, avoiding, accepting, reducing or sharing risk, developing a set of actions to align risks with the entity's risk appetite and risk appetite. 'Control activities:' Policies and procedures are established and implemented to help ensure that risk responses are carried out effectively. 'Information and communication:' The relevant information is identified, captured and communicated in a way and time frame that allow people to fulfill their responsibilities. Effective communication also occurs in a broader sense, flowing down, through and up the entity. 'Monitoring:' The entire business risk management is monitored and modifications are made as necessary. Monitoring is achieved through ongoing management activities, separate evaluations or both. COSO believes that Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework provides a clearly defined interrelation between the components and risk management objectives of an organization that will satisfy the need to comply with the new laws, regulations and standards of listing and waiting that companies accept it widely. and other organizations and stakeholders. =Limitations= COSO admits in its report that, although business risk management provides significant benefits, there are limitations. Business risk management depends on human judgment and, therefore, is susceptible to decision making. Human failures, such as simple errors or errors, can lead to inadequate risk responses. In addition, controls can be avoided by collusion of two or more people, and management has the ability to override business risk management decisions. These limitations prevent a board and management from having absolute security regarding the achievement of the entity's objectives. Philosophically, COSO is more oriented towards controls. Therefore, it has a bias towards risks that could have a negative impact instead of the risks of missing opportunities. See ISO 31000. While COSO states that its expanded model provides more risk management, companies are not required to change to the new model if they are using the Integrated Internal Control Framework. Internal control over financial information - Guidance for small public companies This document contains guidance to help smaller public companies to apply the concepts of 1992 Internal Control - Integrated Framework. This publication shows the applicability of these concepts to help smaller public companies design and implement internal controls to support the achievement of financial information objectives. It highlights 20 key principles of the 1992 framework, providing a principles-based approach to internal control. As explained in the publication, the 2006 guideline applies to entities of all sizes and types.http://www.coso.org/IC.htm, accessed December 28, 2012. Guidance on monitoring internal control systems Companies have invested heavily in improving the quality of their internal controls; However, COSO noted that many organizations do not fully understand the importance of the monitoring component of the COSO framework and the role it plays in streamlining the evaluation process. In January 2009, COSO published its \\"Guidance on the monitoring of internal control systems\\" to clarify the internal control monitoring component. Over time, effective monitoring can lead to organizational efficiencies and reduced costs associated with public information about internal control because problems are identified and addressed proactively, rather than reactively. The COSO Monitoring Guide is based on two fundamental principles originally established in the 2006 COSO Guide: * Continuous and / or separate evaluations allow management to determine if the other components of internal control continue to function over time, and * Internal control deficiencies are identified and communicated in a timely manner to the parties responsible for taking corrective measures and to management and the board, as appropriate. The monitoring guide also suggests that these principles are best achieved through monitoring based on three general elements: * Establish a basis for monitoring, including (a) an appropriate top tone; (b) an effective organizational structure that assigns monitoring roles to people with appropriate capacities, objectivity and authority; and (c) a starting point or \\"baseline\\" of known effective internal control from which continuous monitoring and separate evaluations can be implemented; * Design and execute monitoring procedures focused on \\"persuasive information\\" on the operation of \\"key controls\\" that address \\"significant risks\\" for organizational objectives; Y * Evaluate and report the results, including assessing the severity of any identified deficiencies and reporting the results of monitoring to appropriate staff and the board for timely action and follow-up if necessary. Role of the internal audit Internal auditors play an important role in assessing the effectiveness of control systems. As an independent function that informs senior management, internal audit can evaluate the internal control systems implemented by the organization and contribute to continued effectiveness. As such, internal auditing often plays an important \\"monitoring\\" role. To preserve its independence of judgment, the internal audit should not assume any direct responsibility in the design, establishment or maintenance of the controls that it is supposed to evaluate. You can only advise on possible improvements to be made.

Though he was particularly trained in the Three Treatise school, he was an advocate of the One Vehicle (or Ekayana) as the ultimate and universal perspective of Buddhahood for all, and as such included all schools of Buddha Dharma, including the Five Vehicles and the Three Vehicles, within the meaning of the Mahayana as the One Vehicle.See page 357 of The Way To Buddhahood: Instructions From A Modern Chinese Master Yin Shun's research helped bring forth the ideal of \\"Humanistic\\" (human-realm) Buddhism, a leading mainstream Buddhist philosophy studied and upheld by many practitioners.Zheng Xin's Guide His work also regenerated the interests in the long-ignored Āgamas among Chinese Buddhist society and his ideas are echoed by Theravadin teacher Bhikkhu Bodhi. As a contemporary master, he was most popularly known as the mentor of Cheng Yen (Pinyin: Zhengyan), the founder of Tzu-Chi Buddhist Foundation, as well as the teacher to several other prominent monastics. Although Master Yin Shun is closely associated with the Tzu-Chi Foundation, he has had a decisive influence on others of the new generation of Buddhist monks such as Sheng-yen of Dharma Drum Mountain and Hsing Yun of Fo Guang Shan, who are active in humanitarian aid, social work, environmentalism and academic research as well. He is considered to be one of the most influential figures of Taiwanese Buddhism, having influenced many of the leading Buddhist figures in modern Taiwan. Biography Yin Shun was born on 5 April 1906 (The traditional Chinese calendar: March 12, 丙午) in a village in Zhejiang Province, China. His birth name was Zhang Luqin (Wade–Giles: Chang Luch'in). At the time of Zhang's birth, it was the end of the Qing Dynasty. Eleven days after his birth, Zhang was critically ill and nearly died. He began school at age seven. In his studies, he stumbled upon the subject of immortality—a subject that Zhang found interesting. His parents found what Zhang was doing to be very unusual, so they required him to teach at other schools. Zhang turned his attention to Confucianism and Taoism, but neither of their philosophies could help him find the truth. At one point, Christianity sparked light into his heart. However, Zhang still felt empty, and could not commit himself to Christianity after two years. One day, Zhang was looking for something to read. He stumbled onto the words \\"the Buddha Dharma\\". This immediately sparked interest into his heart again, like what Christianity did for him, and Zhang zealously looked for anything that had to do with Buddhism. Becoming a monasticSearching for the Dharma= In 1930, Zhang applied to a Buddhist college in Beijing. For many days he had traveled from his home to Beijing, with high hopes. He arrived too late for acceptance. While pondering where he could go next, Zhang thought of a temple called \\"Tiantong Temple\\". Zhang then went to Mount Putuo, where he met a young man named Wang. Both searched for an abode where they could study the Buddha Dharma. They eventually found a small place where they could do so, where their abbot who was well cultivated. They asked to study under him. The elder monk then referred Zhang and Wang to another place called Fuzhun Monastery (福泉庵), less than a half mile from where they were. The two hurried to Fuzhun Monastery. Later, on October 11, 1930, the abbot, Master Qingnian (清念和尚), shaved Zhang Luqin's head and gave him the Dharma name of Yin Shun (印順). Three Systems of Mahayana  Master Taixu 太虛 (1890–1947) divided Mahayana Buddhism into three types. They are: School of śūnyatā and prajña (faxing konghui zong 法性空慧宗, Madhyamaka), School of dharmalaksana and vijnaptimatra (faxiang weishi zong 法相唯識宗) and School of dharma-dhatu and perfect enlightenment (fajie yuanjue zong 法界圓覺宗). Furthermore, he states that dharma-dhatu is on the highest level, complete and the final dharma. On the following levels are Madhyamaka and Vijnaptimatra. By contrast, Yinshun 印順 (1906–2005), Tiaxu’s disciple, took a different direction from that of his teacher. He claims that Mahayana Buddhism can be divided into three systems. They are: School of śūnyatā and name only (xingkong 性空唯名系, Madhyamaka), School of illusion and Vijñapti-mātra (weishi 虛妄唯識系, Vijñapti- mātra) and School of genuine and permanent mind (zhenchang 真常唯心系, Tathāgata- garbha). For him, early Mahayana Buddhism is characterized by Nāgārjuna’s 龍樹 prajñapāramitā thought. Mahayana Buddhism, in its middle stage, is characterized by Vijñapti-mātra which was upheld by Asanga and Vasubandhu. Later Mahayana Buddhism is mainly characterized by Tathāgata-garbha thought 如來藏思想. Therefore, it is clear that Yinshun distanced himself from his teacher’s position. Achievements In March 2004, he was awarded the Order of Propitious Clouds Second Class, for his contributions to the revitalization of Buddhism in Taiwan. Encounter with Master Cheng Yen On February 1963, a thirty-two-day novitiate for Buddhist monks and nuns was held in Taipei. Monks and nuns came from all over Taiwan to register. All were accepted except a young female devotee from Hualien, a county in eastern Taiwan. Master Yin Shun recalled the day he first met Master Cheng Yen: ¹At the time, Yin Shun only had three disciples. All three now are teaching the Buddha Dharma in the United States. Master Yin Shun then said to her, \\"Our karmic relationship is very special. As a nun, you must always be committed to Buddhism and to all living beings.\\" Since the registration for the novitiate was about to end within the hour, the venerable master quickly gave the young disciple her Buddhist name, Cheng Yen, and told her to get going and begin the novitiate promptly. At that moment, the conditions for the creation of the Tzu-Chi Foundation began. In the summer of 1979, Master Yin Shun came to Hualien. Living in this beautiful but undeveloped part of the island, Cheng Yen told Master Yin Shun about her aspiration to build a high-quality hospital for the people living in eastern Taiwan, where there were few medical facilities. As he listened to her, he could foresee the daunting challenges lying ahead. Like a father sharing his life experiences with his daughter, he said, \\"Just like the time you told me you intended to begin charity work, I reminded you to think whether you would have the strength and the money when more people came to you for help. The task can only be realized with unwavering commitment.\\" Seeing his disciple's resolution, Master Yin Shun's mind was put at ease. With this talk, the hospital construction project began. Although Cheng Yen would soon face many insurmountable difficulties and challenges, Master Yin Shun's support gave Cheng Yen the strength to go on. He transferred virtually all the monetary offerings made to him by his followers to the hospital construction. The sum accumulated throughout the years was truly sizable. Death and funeral On June 4, 2005, Master Yin Shun died after fighting pulmonary tuberculosis since 1954. He died in Tzu-Chi hospital in Hualien at the age of 100. In Taiwan, many were stunned to hear of his death, even though his death was expected in the coming months. Tzu-Chi, along with other Buddhist organizations and monasteries influenced by Yin Shun, joined in mourning for eight days, the length of his funeral. Among those attending the services were Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian, ROC Premier Frank Hsieh, and other legislators. Several monastics from many parts of the world, predominantly the United States, also attended Master Yin Shun's funeral. Monastics who were disciples of Master Yin Shun also attended the funeral, including Master Cheng Yen herself. Master Yin Shun had a simple and spartan lifestyle in the last days of his life, so his disciples decided to keep his funeral simple but solemn. His funeral was held at Fu Yan Vihara in Hsinchu, where he had lived for many years until his death. Master Yin Shun was later cremated on June 10 and his ashes and his portrait used during the services were placed inside a hall alongside the remains of other monastics.

In the range of its functions the council was often more important than the Estates in the running the country. Its registers include a wide range of material on the political, administrative, economic and social affairs of Scotland. The council supervised the administration of the law, regulated trade and shipping, took emergency measures against the plague, granted licences to travel, administered oaths of allegiance, banished beggars and Gypsies, dealt with witches, recusants, Covenanters and Jacobites and tackled the problem of lawlessness in the Highlands and the Borders. History Like the Parliament, the council was a development of the King's Council. The King's Council, or curia regis, was the court of the monarch surrounded by his royal officers and others upon whom he relied for advice. It is known to have existed in the thirteenth century, if not earlier, but has left little trace of its activities. By the later fifteenth century the council had advisory, executive and judicial functions though surviving records are mainly confined to the last. It is at this period that the 'secret' or privy council makes its formal appearance when, in February 1490, parliament elected 2 bishops, an abbot or prior, 6 barons and 8 royal officers to form the king's council for the ostensioun and forthputting of the King's authorite in the administracioun of justice. The Lords of Secret Council, as they were known, were part of the general body of Lords of Council, like the Lords of Session and Lords Auditors of Exchequer. After 1532 much of the judicial business was transferred to the newly founded College of Justice, the later Court of Session. The council met regularly and was particularly active during periods of a monarch's minority. A separate register of the privy council appears in 1545 and probably marks the point at which the secret council split off from its parent body. After 1603 James VI was able to boast to the English Parliament that he governed Scotland with my pen. The council received his written instructions and executed his will. This style of government, continued by his grandsons Charles II and James VII, was disrupted during the reign of Charles I by the Covenanters and the Cromwellian occupation. There are gaps in the register during the upheavals of 1638–41 when the council was largely displaced by an alternative administration set up by the Covenanters and during the Cromwellian period, the council ceased to act at all. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II nominated his own privy councillors and set up a council in London through which he directed affairs in Edinburgh, a situation that continued after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–9. The council survived the Act of Union but for one year only. It was abolished on 1 May 1708 by the Parliament of Great Britain and thereafter there was one Privy Council of Great Britain sitting in London. Until 1707, the Privy Council met in what is now the West Drawing Room at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. It was called the Council Chamber in the 17th century. The Register of the Privy Council of Scotland (1545–1689) was edited and published between 1877 and 1970 by John Hill Burton, David Masson, Peter Hume Brown and Henry Macleod Paton. Lord President of the Privy Council The President of the Privy Council was one of the Great Officers of State in Scotland. The Lord Chancellor presided over the Council ex officio, but in 1610 James VI decreed that the President of the College of Justice should preside in the Chancellor's absence, and by 1619 the additional title of President of the Privy Council had been added. The two presidencies were separated in 1626 as part of Charles I's reoganisation of the Privy Council and Court of Session. The Lord President of the council was accorded precedence as one of the King's chief officers in 1661, but appeared in the Estates of Parliament only intermittently. *1625: The 4th Earl of Montrose *1649: The 1st Earl of Loudoun *1660: The 7th Earl of Rothes *1663: The 2nd Earl of Tweeddale *1672: The 1st Duke of Lauderdale *1681: Sir George Gordon of Haddo, 3rd Bt., later created Earl of Aberdeen *1682: The 3rd Marquess of Montrose *1686: The 1st Duke of Queensberry (questioned) *1689: The 18th Earl of Crawford and 2nd Earl of Lindsay *1692: The 2nd Earl of Annandale and Hartfell (later created 1st Marquess of Annandale) *1695: The 1st Earl of Melville *1702: The 1st Marquess of Annandale *1704: The 4th Marquess of Montrose *1705: The 1st Marquess of Annandale *1706: The 4th Marquess of Montrose (later created 1st Duke of Montrose) office abolished in 1708 See also *Privy Council * :Category:Members of the Privy Council of Scotland  External links  _The Register of the Privy Council of Scotland (edited and abridged) – 2nd Series_ (incomplete)   * * _Other links_ * Category:Lists of Scottish people Category:1708 disestablishments in Great Britain ","title":"Privy Council of Scotland"},{"id":"2009132","text":"Jacob's Creek is a small creek located in Mid North region of the Australian state of South Australia. Course and features Jacob's Creek rises in the Barossa Ranges and flows westward through the wine-producing region of the Barossa Valley, approximately north of Adelaide. The creek is only several kilometres long and eventually meets the North Para River at . The watercourse is studded with ancient and picturesque River Red Gums. It was first discovered (but not named) by Europeans in December 1837 by an expedition led Colonel William Light and was surveyed in 1839 by his assistant surveyor, William Jacob (1814–1902), as part of a wider survey of the Barossa region. Jacob settled here in the early 1840s, hence the origin of the name. In the local aboriginal dialect it is called \\"Cowieaurita\\", meaning \\"yellow-brown water\\", in an area known to them as Moorooroo, which became the name of the Hundred. In the early 1840s Jacob's Creek was briefly home to Johann Menge, South Australia's first geologist, who lived for some time on an island and in nearby cave on the creek. Here he grew vegetables, and was particularly struck with the possibilities for viticulture. Menge was influential in facilitating the settlement from the Barossa Valley by German Lutheran immigrants. The creek lent its name to the famous wine brand Jacob's Creek, which is produced by Orlando Wines, located southwest along the Barossa Valley Highway in the small town of Rowland Flat. Johann Gramp, the founder of Orlando Wines, first planted grape vines on the banks of Jacob's Creek in 1847. In 1997 Orlando Wines, in conjunction with the Northern Adelaide and Barossa Catchment Water Management Board, commenced a rejuvenation project for Jacob's Creek. All non- native plants and trees, such as bamboo, ash, and olives were removed, and replanted with blue gums, red gums and other Australian native trees and shrubs. As a result of the project, many native species of frogs, native fish, and waterbirds have returned, with the creek gradually returning to its former natural state.Jacobs Creek Rejuvenation Project See also *List of rivers of South Australia References Category:Rivers of South Australia Category:Barossa Valley Category:Mid North (South Australia) ","title":"Jacobs Creek (Australia)"},{"id":"2009148","text":"Judith Leiber (born Judit Pető; January 11, 1921 – April 28, 2018) was a Hungarian-American fashion designer and businesswoman. Life and career Leiber was born Judit Pető in 1921 in Budapest, Hungary, to Helene, a Vienna- born homemaker, and Emil, a commodities broker. She also had one sister named Eva. Leiber was sent to King's College London in 1938 by her family to study chemistry for the cosmetics industry, in part since her father thought she would be safer in London in the case of a war. She returned to Hungary before World War II, where thanks to family connections she obtained a traineeship at a handbag company, where she learned to cut and mold leather, make patterns, frame and stitch bags. She was the first woman graduated to master craftswoman, becoming the first woman to join the Hungarian Handbag Guild in Budapest. She avoided Nazi persecution when she escaped the Holocaust of World War II to the safety of a house set aside for Swiss citizens, when her father, a Hungarian Jew who managed the grain department of a bank, was able to obtain a Swiss schutzpass, a document that gave the bearer safe passage. This pass is on view at the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC. The flat where Leiber survived the war housed 26 people. In December 1944, those living in the apartment were taken to one of the Hungarian Nazi-run ghettos. After the liberation of Hungary by the Red Army, Leiber's family moved into a basement with 60 other people. In 1946, she married Gerson Leiber (Gus), who was a sergeant in the United States Army serving in Eastern Europe. They met when she was making purses for the secretaries of the American Legation in Budapest, and they moved to New York City in 1947. He was an abstract expressionist painter, member of the National Academy of Design, with some of his works displayed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Museum, the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and other institutions. Fashion career After working as a handbag designer for other companies, Leiber founded her own business in 1963. She is known for her crystal minaudières, evening purses made of a metal shell often encrusted with Swarovski crystals, plated with silver or gold and with various forms, such as baby pigs, slices of watermelon, cupcakes, peacocks, penguins, and snakes. Sold at exclusive boutiques around the world, her purses may cost up to several thousand dollars and have become a status symbol for many women, including several Presidential First Ladies to whom she has given them as a present, from Mamie Eisenhower to Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton. Animals are a recurring theme in her designs, and often ornament the most expensive purses of the collection, with prices on some animal-shaped minaudières exceeding US$7,000. Some wealthy women collect them; Bernice Norman, an arts patron in New Orleans, owns close to 300 of the Leiber bags. In 1994, Leiber received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers. She retired in 1998. In September 2008, she was rated the most prestigious luxury handbag brand for the second year running by the New York-based Luxury Institute. In 2010, Leiber received a Visionary Woman Award from Moore College of Art & Design. Examples of her work can be found in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Virginia, has had a gallery of her work on display since it opened in 2008. The Leibers bought property in Springs, New York in 1956 and it became their primary residence in 2011. In 2005 they opened the Leiber Museum across the street from their home to display the bags as well as paintings by Gerson Leiber. The Leibers sought to buy back an example of all of the purses to be displayed at the museum. The museum also displays various awards including the 1973 Coty Award. Stores The Judith Leiber boutiques are exclusive as there are only four in the world. They are located in New Delhi, Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. However, some of her collection is available at selected fashion stores like Neiman Marcus, Harvey Nichols, Lane Crawford, Holt Renfrew, Harrods, and Saks Fifth Avenue. Death Leiber died at her home in Springs, New York, on April 28, 2018, just a few hours after her husband Gerson Leiber had died.

Ratu Vakalalabure claimed to hold the chiefly title of Vunivalu of Natewa, one of the three senior titles in Cakaudrove Province, which was never publicly or officially challenged. He served as a Senator in the 1990s, becoming President of the Senate before winning the Cakaudrove West Fijian Communal Constituency in the House of Representatives in a byelection in 1996.

Vakalalabure was the father of eight children, including Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure, who became Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives in 2001, and subsequently served a prison sentence for his involvement in the coup d'état that deposed the elected government in 2000. Valalalabure's right to the title of Vunivalu of Natewa was disputed by some from the Natewa region. The last time prior to his death that anyone was officially installed as Vunivalu of Natewa was in September 1974http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?ref=archive&id;=157645 when Lotaropate Rakuita Saurara (1908-1985 - a.k.a.

It is in the civil parish of Lyminge. The village has a standard golf courseDescription and aerial photograph at UK Golf Guide. noted for its hills, as well as a pub restaurant called The New Inn which claims to be the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel.Banner claim on the pub's official website. Village facilities include a basketball court, two football goals, and a village hall. A large BT Group communication mast, which was used as a telecommunication relay during the Cold War, still stands in the village. History The hamlet of Etchinghill lies at the southern end of the Parish of Lyminge. Its original name was Tettinghelde 1240 (Tetta’s slope). A spring rises to the north side of Westfield Lane, (the road to Tolsford Hill) and the resultant stream flows across the fields to join up with the Nailbourne that rises in Well Field, Lyminge. This stream is known as the East Brook and probably in the Saxon period, when the settlement got its name of Tetinghelde, the volume of water would have been much greater. By the 15th Century the hamlet’s name had altered to “Etynghyld” and “Etynghyll”. Later known as Eachendhill or Etchinghole before settling to become Etchinghill. For centuries the hamlet remained a small farming community around the cross-roads, one of which led to Dover; one going south to Hythe and north to the village of Lyminge where the church is; the track up Westfield Lane over Tolsford Hill led people to West Hythe no doubt, but the importance of this waned as the coastline altered; and a final lane (now vanished) led to Newington. Over the years the hamlet has grown with additional development on all four of the roads leading from the crossroads, the establishment of a cricket club and, more recently, the creation of a golf course spreading across the land which separates Etchinghill from Lyminge. Railway To the North-East of the Village are the remains of the Elham Valley Railway, characterised by steep-sided cuttings and tunnels. The line which ran from Canterbury to the port of Folkestone, was closed in 1947 and dismantled between 1950 and 1954. The line is crossed by Teddars Leas Road (bridge) and Badger's Bridge as well as the Golf Course. Although there was no station in Etchinghill, villagers could catch the train by travelling to the neighbouring village of Lyminge, approximately 2 miles to the North via road or one of the many public footpaths. Boche Buster Boche Buster at Bishopsbourne on the Elham Valley Railway, 21 March 1941. During the war, Etchinghill was home to the Boche Buster, a large rail-mounted gun which could be retracted into one of the many tunnels to provide cover from aerial photography and German bombing raids,Details and photographs of the gun at subterraneanhistory.co.uk. and which gained a certain notoriety owing to its large size (there were other large rail-mounted guns in service, but none of 18 inch bore). The Elham Valley Railway was requisitioned during the war as a military railway. With a range of around 12 miles, the gun was designed to attack invading German forces whilst still in mid-channel. Some sources still claim that the Boche Buster had a range of over 30 milesReport and railway gun photograph at etchinghill.info website. and could fire across the channel into German-occupied France. This was not the case, although it shared a considerable amount of history with a set of 13.5 inch railway guns also stationed in Kent, which were capable of firing into German-occupied France. The gun's location and operation were considered secret, and it was initially transported to Kent disguised (by camouflage) as a banana freight train.See source at Elham.co.uk website. St Mary's Hospital Until the early 1990s, the village was dominated by St Mary's Hospital. This was constructed in 1836 by the Elham Poor Law Union as the workhouse for the surrounding area, including the towns of Folkestone and Hythe. Prior to this each parish had relieved the poor the best way they could, usually by allowing them to remain in their own homes and giving them outdoor relief, although Elham and Newington each had a small local workhouse facility. In 1834 Parliament passed the Poor Law Amendment Act and suggested parishes might group together and provide cross-community facilities. This led to the foundation of the Elham Poor Law Union in 1835, and the building of the workhouse at Etchinghill in 1836 at a cost of £6,500. Designed by architect Sir Francis Head, the workhouse was designed to accommodate 300 inmates. In 1841 an additional building had been erected to provide food and temporary accommodation to some of the many vagrants who wandered the countryside. Despite its large size, it was considerably extended in 1890, with the addition of new dormitory wards, an infirmary, and a chapel.See details at Workhouses.org.uk website. Following the closure of the workhouse in 1947, the buildings passed to the National Health Service, and were re-opened as St Mary's Hospital, specialising in geriatric care. There was also a hospital annexe providing isolation facilities for patients with highly infectious diseases. The hospital was helped by community volunteers who included hospital visitors (who befriended patients), the local St. John Ambulance (who provided qualified auxiliary nurses for routine nursing and bed making duties throughout the 1980s), and a very active League of Friends (who raised money to provide many additional comforts for the residents), active from 1962 until the hospital's closure.Founding and winding up details at Open Charities directory listing. St Mary’s hospital was closed in 1990 and all the buildings, with the exception of the un-consecrated chapel, were demolished. 52 houses now occupy approximately two thirds of the land, with a new village hall and amenity land for all to enjoy taking up the remainder of the land. The hospital chapel, the last remaining physical element, has been converted into a private house.

The federal coat of arms (eidgenössisches Wappen) was defined by the Swiss Diet (Tagsatzung) in 1815, for the Restored Confederacy. A more elaborate federal seal was also defined, as the federal coat of arms surrounded by the twenty-two cantonal coats of arms. Similar heraldic arrangements representing the Thirteen Cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy are on record from the mid-16th century. The 1815 legislation remained in force in the federal state established in 1848, as was explicitly recognized by the Federal Council in 1889. While the simple coat of arms was in wide use, especially on coins, and from the early 20th century also on car number plates and passports, the full seal did not see official use beyond its representation in stained glass in the Federal Palace of Switzerland (c. 1900). The 19th-century definition of the federal seal and coat of arms was replaced only in 2017, with the adoption of a new law which defined the Swiss coat of arms as \\"a Swiss cross in a triangular shield\\" with fixed proportions, but which no longer recognizes a federal seal.Bundesgesetz zum Schutz öffentlicher Wappen und anderer öffentlicher Zeichen vom 5. Juni 1931 (Stand am 1. August 2008). Design Hatched coat of arms as shown in the 2017 legislation The 2017 law defines the \\"Swiss coat of arms\\" (German: Schweizerwappen) formally the \\"Coat of Arms of the Swiss Confederation\\" (, , ) as \\"a Swiss cross in a triangular shield\\". The Swiss cross (, , ) is defined as :\\"a white, upright, free-standing cross depicted against a red background, whose arms, which are all of equal size, are one-sixth longer than they are wide.\\" The shape of the \\"triangular shield\\" is defined by means of an image given in an annex to article 2. The color red to be used is specified in the same annex as: :CMYK 0 / 100 / 100 / 0 :Pantone 485 C or 485 U :RGB 255 / 0 / 0 Hexadecimal #FF0000 :Scotchcal 100 -13 :RAL 3020 Traffic red :NCS S 1085-Y90R The triangular shield has been in use by the federal administration since the first half of the 20th century. It is an unusual shape, based on the triangular or \\"heater\\" shaped shield of classical heraldry, but with a curved top. Alternative shapes of the heraldic shield were also in frequent use, and still remain in use in spite of the 2017 legislation. A frequently seen shield shape is the \\"Iberian\\" or \\"curved\\" type, specifically used to mark Swiss embassies and border crossings, and also used on the five franks coin. Another frequently seen variant is a Renaissance-style articulated shield, shown as being held by the national personification Helvetia on the ½, 1 and 2 franks coins. HistoryOld Confederacy= thumbThe coats of arms of the Thirteen Cantons as shown on the \\"baptismal medal\\" or Patenpfennig presented by the Confederacy to Princess Claude of Valois (by Jacob Stampfer of Zürich (1547). The Swiss cross originates as a field sign worn by the troops of the Old Swiss Confederacy. Use of the emblem is attested with certainty in the context of the Old Zürich War, for the year 1444, when the Tagsatzung defended itself against allegations that the troops of the Confederacy had deceptively used two different field signs (Heerzeichen). Aegidius Tschudi (Chronik II.390) cites a song containing this allegation, specifying that the Swiss were bearing \\"two kinds of crosses, white at the back and red in front\\" (Si trügend zweierlei Crützeren, [...] Hinden wiß und vornen rot) to deceive the Zürich side.BBl 1889 IV (12 November 1889), p. 632. Heraldic representation of the Confederacy was by representations of the cantonal coats of arms. Petermann Etterlin on the title page of his Kronika of 1507 shows the coats of arms of the Thirteen Cantons (besides those of Chur, Valais and St. Gallen) surrounding the imperial coat of arms, reflecting the claim of the cantons of the Confederacy to imperial immediacy within the Holy Roman Empire. The first known example where the cantonal coats of arms are shown as surrounding a Swiss cross representing the Confederacy is a medal commissioned by the Tagsatzung from Zürich goldsmith Hans Stampfer in 1547 as a gift for the French princess Claude. The obverse side of this medal shows the coats of arms of the Thirteen Cantons in their order of precedence, the reverse shows the coats of arms of the Associates, both groups surrounding a central cross with ornamental foliage. Similar representations are found throughout the early modern period, on commemorative medals and on regimental seals used by Swiss Guards in French service.BBl 1889 IV (12 November 1889), p. 631.

Seal of the Swiss Confederacy as defined by the Tagsatzung in 1815 The Tagsatzung (Swiss Diet) re-introduced the white cross in the red field for the seal of the Confederacy in 1814. The commission for drafting a federal constitution on 16 May 1814 recommended the adoption of a seal of the Confederacy based on the \\"field sign of the old Swiss\\".Article 41 (of the draft constitution): \\"Das Siegel der Eidgenossenschaft ist das Feldzeichen der alten Schweizer: ein weißes freistehendes Kreuz im rothen Felde, sammt der Umschrift: Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft.\\" On 4 July 1815, the Diet accepted the design of the commission, adopting it as the provisional seal and describing it as \\"in the center, the federal red shield with the white cross as common federal heraldic emblem, surrounded by a simple circular Gothic ornament, on the outside of which the inscription 'Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft' with the year number MDCCCXV, and in an outer circle all XXII cantonal coat of arms in circular fields, according to their federal order of precedence; around all, a simple wreath\\".\\"In der Mitte der eidgenössische rothe Schild mit dem weißen Kreuz als gemeineidgenössisches Wappenzeichen ; ringsherum eine zirkeiförmige einfache gothische Verzierung; außer derselben die Inschrift: Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, mit der Jahreszahl MDCCCXV; in einem äußern Zirkel alle XXII Kantonswappen in runden Feldern nach ihrer eidgenössischen Rangordnung, und das Ganze mit einem einfachen Siegelkranze in unterschobenen kleinen Blättern geschlossen\\" (Bd.

Later in the 19th century, there was a trend of depicting the cross as composed of five equal squares. The two competing designs were controversially discussed in the late 19th century, especially after the introduction of the new design for the five franks coin, which showed the Swiss coat of arms in a Baroque- style heraldic shield. The Federal Council in 1889 introduced the 7:6 ratio as official. The associated communication explains that \\"our heraldic cross is not a mathematical figure, but at the same the Christian cross symbol and the field sign of the Old Confederacy\\". The 1889 law avoids specification of the shape of the shield, the omission being explained in the communication as deliberate, in order to avoid prejudicing the ongoing controversy, and in order to enable the shape of the shield to be left to the \\"tastes of the current time and practical necessity\\".\\"Wir haben uns bei dem nachstehenden Beschlussesvorschlag, der das Wappen der Eidgenossenschaft in unzweideutiger Weise festzustellen bestimmt ist, an das alte Herkommen gehalten, wonach unser Wappenkreuz nicht eine mathematische Figur, sondern das christliche Kreuzessymbol und zugleich das alteidgenössische Feldzeichen darstellt. Bezüglich des Wappen Schildes, dessen Gestalt auf den neuen eidgenössischen Fünffrankenstücken allermeist zu der Kritik in der Tagespresse und so indirekt zu der Stellung Ihres Postulats die Veranlassung gegeben hat, ist es durchaus unthunlich, eine offizielle Form ein für alle Mal festzustellen. Ob auch der Schild selbst ein wesentlicher Bestandteil eines jeden Wappens bildet, so ist dagegen dessen Gestalt rein nebensächlich, gleichgültig und hängt gänzlich von der Geschmacksrichtung der Zeit und dann auch von dem praktischen Bedürfniß des gegebenen Falles ab. Wir haben deßwegen unterlassen, eine diesbezügliche Bestimmung in den Beschluß aufzunehmen'. \\"BBl 1889 IV (12 November 1889), p. 636. The legislation, passed on 12 December 1889 (SR 111), explicitly invokes the Tagsatzung decision of 1815 as retaining validity, with the only addition of specifying the proportions of the cross, the four arms having equal length, in a ratio to their width of .Bundesbeschluss betreffend das eidgenössische Wappen vom 12. Dezember 1889 In the 1850 series of the Swiss franc coins, the small denominations (1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 centimes) had a coat of arms with floral ornaments, while the larger denominations (½, 1, 2 and 5 francs) showed a seated Helvetia figure holding a triangular shield on which the Swiss cross was displayed within an oval shape. The coat of arms in the denominations 5, 10 and 20 centimes was replaced by a female head (Liberty) in 1881. In the 1 and 2 centimes coins, the coat of arms was replaced by a simple Swiss cross in 1948. For the ½, 1, and 2 francs coins, the seated Helvetia was replaced by her standing figure in 1875. The 1888 five franks coin showed a coat of arms with a heraldic shield in a shape inspired by Baroque cartouche designs. The 1922 design of the five franks coin introduced a simplified shield of the rounded \\"Iberian\\" type. The Model 1900/06 Parabellum pistol (\\"Swiss Luger\\") had a Swiss cross engraved on the top of the chamber. The Swiss cross was represented as \\"in splendor\\" in the batches produced during 1906-1908, and in a heraldic shield from 1909. The heraldic shield was of the \\"baroque\\" type, with an engrailed top, in the 1900/06 models produced from 1909-1914 by Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken (DWM). The coat of arms is no longer present in the model 1900/06 batches produced by Waffenfabrik Bern during 1918-1933\\\\. The Swiss coat of arms is again present on the Model 1929 Parabellum pistol made by Waffenfabrik Bern during 1933-1947, now with a triangular shield.Pistole 1900/06, Pistole 1900/06 W+F (Pistole 06/24), Pistole 06/29 (swisswaffen.com) Ordnance pistols produced for the army, models SIG Sauer P210 (1949-1975) and SIG Sauer P220 (from 1975) continued to have the Swiss coat of arms with triangular shield engraved on the slide, rendered in simple outline (without hatching of the shield). The representation of the Swiss coat of arms in a convex triangular shield representing the federal administration is a tradition introduced in the early 20th century. This special shield shape had no official force prior to the adoption as \\"logo\\" in 2005, but it came to be used de facto as emblem by the federal authorities from the 1930s, shown on Swiss passports during 1932-1984 (the passport of 1915 still showed a coat of arms with a \\"French\\" style shield in a wreath on its first page). Early Swiss car registration plates, introduced in 1905, showed coats of arms with articulate \\"Baroque\\" shields. Beginning in 1933, this design was replaced by simplified a shield shape of the \\"triangular\\" type with vertical sides, with slight design variations between cantons. Use by the federal administration The 2005 logo used by the Swiss federal administration A Swiss army knife -- the ordnace model (Soldatenmesser) issued in the Swiss Armed Forces (2008 model). The cardboard box shows the Swiss coat of arms used as the company logo by the manufacturer, Victorinox, while engraved on the knife itself is the triangular coat of arms used by the federal authorities. The Federal Council in 2004 announced the introduction of a \\"corporate design\\" in the sense of a contemporary logo, to be used by all organs of the federal administration. Adoption by the Federal Council itself was announced for 2005, with adoption to be complete by all of the federal administration by the end of 2006, with a projected cost of CHF 25 million.Bundesverwaltung erhält einheitliches Erscheinungsbild 25 August 2004. The logo consists of the Swiss coat of arms in convex triangular shield alongside the name \\"Swiss Confederacy\\" in the four national languages in black Frutiger Light typeset. Provision is made for using white script and adding a white line surrounding the coat of arms in cases where the logo is printed on red or black backgrounds.Corporate Design der Schweizerischen Bundesverwaltung Version 8.1 (2018) In keeping with the new logo, a new law was passed in 2017, known as Wappenschutzgesetz (WSchG, SR 232.21). This law replaces a 1931 law on the protection of federal, cantonal and foreign heraldic emblems. While the older law did not contain any specifications as to federal emblems, the new law specifies the \\"Swiss coat of arms\\" and the \\"Swiss flag\\", including two images in an annex, declared as authoritative in the text of the law, so that the federal \\"Swiss coat of arms\\" is now defined as a Swiss cross in a convex triangular shield.SR 232.21 (\\"Federal Act on the Protection of the Swiss Coat of Arms and Other Public Signs (Coat of Arms Protection Act, CAPA)\\") \\"Art. 1 Swiss cross: The Swiss cross is a white, upright, free-standing cross depicted against a red background, whose arms, which are all of equal size, are one- sixth longer than they are wide. Art. 2 Swiss coat of arms: 1 The Coat of Arms of the Swiss Confederation (the Swiss coat of arms) is a Swiss cross in a triangular shield. 2 The example depicted in Annex 1 defines the shape, colour and proportions. Art. 3 Swiss flag: 1 The Swiss flag shows a Swiss cross on a square background. 2 The example depicted in Annex 2 defines the shape, colour and proportions.\\" The 2017 law thus also renders obsolete the 1815 definition of the federal coat of arms and its 1889 confirmation, SR 111 being marked as abrogated per 1 January 2017. The image of the coat of arms shown in the document shows the hatching indicating heraldic tincture (red or gules indicated by vertical hatching) which has traditionally been used in black- and-white representations of the coat of arms throughout the 20th century. By contrast, the \\"corporate design\\" manual used by the federal administration specifies that no such hatching is to be shown in black-and-white representations of the logo, the red shield instead being shown in solid black. In spite of the more restrictive 2017 definition of the \\"Swiss coat of arms\\", other styles of heraldic shield remain in official use, specifically on coins and number plates. A number of regulations passed along with the new flag law, also in force from 2017, restricted the commercial use of the Swiss cross. Dubbed the \\"Swissness regulation\\" (Swissness-Verordnung), these changes were originally proposed in 2006 by national councillor Jasmin Hutter and state councillor Anita Fetz, Postulat 06.3056 Schutz der Marke Schweiz, Postulat 06.3174 Verstärkung der Marke Made in Switzerland. and eventually implemented in five separate regulations.Bundesrat verabschiedet Umsetzungs- verordnungen zur Swissness-Vorlage, press release, 2 September 2015. Numerous exceptions were granted to companies who have historically used the Swiss cross, such as Swiss army knife producer Victorinox (uses the federal coat of arms as company logo since 1909).

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Rakovica.  Location  Resnik is located in the southern section of the municipality and makes the southernmost point of the urban Belgrade City Proper. Originally a village distant from Belgrade, which developed between the valleys of the creek of Rakovički potok and the Topčiderka river. The creek of Pariguz flows through the southern parts of Resnik before it empties into the Topčiderka. The settlement is roughly triangularly shaped and bordered by the settlements of Sunčani Breg, Jelezovac, Straževica (north), Petlovo Brdo and Kijevo (north-west) which make Resnik's urban connection to the rest of Belgrade. The other three sides are still not urbanized (fields of Klik, Mandrine, Hladna Voda, Pašinac, etc.). Kadinac creek flows into the Topčiderka west of the neighborhood. As it grows, Resnik almost makes a continuously built-up area with Rušanj on the south, and Pinosava on the south-east.  History  The village of Resnik was mentioned in Ottoman defter from 1528. It had 17 houses in 1713 and 33 in 1718. First school was open in 1842. Resnik was a separate village and had its own municipality from 1832 until the 1959/1960 administrative reform, when became part of the Čukarica municipality. In 1972, it lost a separate settlement status and became part of the Belgrade urban proper. When municipality of Rakovica was reconstructed in 1974 from part of Čukarica, Resnik became part of it. It continued to be the seat of the local community, a sub-municipal administrative unit. By the 1981 census it was divided in two (Resnik and Avala Grad) and in 2010 two new local communities were created: Železnička Stanica Resnik and Sunčani Breg. When the neighboring Kijevo lost its separate settlement status in 1959, the majority of its area was attached to the village of Kneževac, but one small part became a cadastral part of Resnik. From the 1970s, local entrepreneurs attempted to turn Resnik into the nightlife attraction. In the 1970s, a club \\"Resnik\\" was opened in the former adult movie theater which was closed by the authorities. In the 1980s, a club \\"Cvetni Breg\\" was also opened. Though gaining some prominence, the move ultimately failed as the venues, being distant from downtown, weren't much attended.  Characteristics  Resnik is predominantly residential settlement. It is close to the important traffic routes: the valley of Rakovički potok is a route to the Kružni put, suburban road of Belgrade and the future part of the projected Belgrade beltway, and a Belgrade-Požarevac railway, while the valley of Topčiderka is a route to the Belgrade-Niš railway. Resnik has a railway stations on both railways (northern one is officially styled Jajinci but it is far from that neighborhood). Tunnels are constructed on both road and railway passing through the northern section of Resnik. The building industry develops along the Kružni put as a series of construction companies, cement plants and a building material's depots are located there. An open green market (kvantaš) is also located on the road. The artificial lake Pariguz is a well-known attraction in the area. It was made in 1989/90 and named after the nearby creek. It is a popular summer destination for many inhabitants of Resnik and for Belgraders who have weekend-houses in the area, even though the water was never tested and the banks are not arranged. Lake Pariguz was the proposed site of the 3rd European Peoples Global Action held in 2004, before it was moved to Jajinci.BeyondMayDay: Over the Resnik Horizonall4all.org  PGA conference in Europe organization summary  Sub-neighborhoods  Avala Grad = Urban settlement built in the period from the 1970s to the 1990s. = Patin Majdan = South-eastern extension of the neighborhood, in the direction of Pinosava. It is located on the Topčiderka river and is prone to flash floods during the heavy rains. = Sunčani Breg = Formerly the northernmost extension of Resnik, across the railway, in the Miljakovac direction. Split into the separate local community in 2010.  Transport  Resnik has its own railway station. Resnik railway station was located on the, now defunct, regional express network of BG Voz. On 13 April 2018, it became part of BG Voz, Belgrade's urban rail system, which connected Resnik with the Belgrade Centre railway station in Prokop. The projected commuting time, via Kijevo, Kneževac, Rakovica, Košutnjak and Topčider (the train will not stop at the last two stations), is calculated at only 18 minutes. Neighbourhood is served by five bus lines from GSP Belgrade; 47 ( Slavija - Resnik) , 94 (New Belgrade - Resnik), 503 (Voždovac - Resnik), 504 (Vidikovac - Resnik) and 506 (Patin majdan - Resnik), also a line passing through the settlement is 507 (Kneževac - Rušanj)  Future  In September 2007 an official motion was started by the municipality of Voždovac to create new sub-Avalan municipality (Avalski Venac), which would include the settlements of Ripanj, Beli Potok, Pinosava and Zuce from Voždovac, Vrčin from the municipality of Grocka and Resnik. It was supported by the local Voždovac administration headed by the Democratic Party at the time, but not by the members of the same party on the city level. It was also proposed by the political party G17 Plus in 2010 and Nova Stranka in 2015, but with Resnik remaining in Rakovica.

Biography Born in Rural Retreat, Virginia to Andrew Phillippe and Jane Margaret Hackler, Phillipe was one of eight children (two brothers and five sisters). When he was three, his family moved to the Dakota Territory near the town of Athol, located in what is now the state of South Dakota, where he would play semi-pro ball for many years. =Louisville Colonels= Phillippe first appeared in pro baseball with the National League's Louisville Colonels in 1899. He had a 21–17 record that year, which was highlighted by a no-hitter in his seventh career game. While the Colonels disbanded after the season, owner Barney Dreyfuss moved a number of Louisville players, including Phillippe, to the Pirates, another team Dreyfuss co-owned. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Phillippe won 20 games for four straight seasons as the Pirates won three straight National League pennants from 1901 to 1903. In 1900, he pitched for the Pirates in Game 3 of the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup series to determine the National League champion between the Pirates and the Brooklyn Superbas. Pittsburgh avoided the series sweep as Phillippe threw a six-hit shutout and the Pirates' bats added 10 runs. The Pirates lost the series 3 games to 1. In 1903, Phillippe earned the honor of starting the first World Series game for the Pirates against the Boston Americans in 1903. In a complete game victory, Phillippe struck out 10 batters and earned the win against Cy Young to start the best-of-nine series. He single-handedly guided the Pirates to a 3–1 series lead, earning the wins in each game, but when his arm wore down due to overuse, the Americans came back to win the series 5 games to 3, with Phillippe losing the last two. His five decisions in the World Series are still a record for a pitcher. To show their appreciation, Pirates' fans presented him with a diamond horseshoe stickpin and team owner Barney Dreyfuss rewarded him ten shares of stock in the club. Phillippe missed half of the 1904 season due to a sore arm, before winning 20 games for the sixth time in 1905. However his years as an ace ended in 1908, when he suffered from another sore arm and missed nearly the entire season. Phillippe returned in 1909 to play a bit role on a Pirate team which went 110–42, en route to their first World Series title. In 1910, he was primarily used as a relief pitcher and had a 14–2 record. He retired after the 1911 season after making only three appearances that year. =Pittsburgh Filipinos= In 1912, he managed the Pittsburgh Filipinos, which were named after him, and began play in the United States Baseball League. The Filipinos finished in first place during the league's inaugural season, which lasted only one month, with a 19-7 record. The team then moved to the new Federal League in 1913 and, for a short time, was later renamed the Pittsburgh Stogies. =Legacy= Phillippe was widely renowned for his control. No pitcher who has debuted since 1893 (when the pitching mound was moved to its present distance of 60 feet and 6 inches away from home plate) has averaged fewer walks per nine innings than Phillippe. Deacon is a distant relative of actor Ryan Phillippe, who named his first son Deacon (born in 2003) in honor of the pitcher. The spring that supplies Rural Retreat, Virginia with water is called Phillippe Springs. Phillippe was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1982.

It is currently entitled TRUMP® WHITE HOUSE, and is published by Americatastic, Inc. Bill Clinton Era WHITEHOUSE.ORG was registered in 1995 by San Francisco residents Mark Pace & Brooks Talley, who first published satirical campaign spoofs on the site during the 1996 re-election campaign of Bill Clinton against Senator Bob Dole. Pace and Talley also registered dole96.org and clinton96.org. George W. Bush Era The George W. Bush version of WHITEHOUSE.ORG was a long-running website parody of the 43rd U.S. President and his family, friends and administration. Launched by Chickenhead Productions in September 2001, the website's banner reads: \\"THE WHITE HOUSE\\" (and then in smaller print underneath) \\"OFFICIOUS WEBSITE OF PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH\\". Additionally, a spoof of the Seal of the President of the United States, with the bald eagle replaced with a vulture, appears on each webpage. In spite of the site's authors' best efforts to make its satirical nature obvious, reader mail posted to the website indicated that some users nevertheless believed (or at least pretended to believe) WHITEHOUSE.ORG was the real White House website. The George W. Bush version of WHITEHOUSE.ORG remains archived at whitehouse.georgewbush.org. =Humor and themes= The website's purpose was to satirize the George W. Bush administration, their supporters and their politics using farce. The authors depicted the administration and their supporters as greedy, arrogant, overtly egotistical, culturally ignorant, nepotist, misogynist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic power-hungry warhawks who have absolutely no regard for any privacy or human rights other than their own. In keeping with those characterizations, women and ethnic and religious minorities who are in or favor the administration are ironically portrayed as unquestioning flock in (relatively) low-level job positions and who the white men of the administration dislike but keep around for support. For example, former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norm Mineta is listed as the \\"Chauffeur\\" and unfeatured anywhere but the list of members of the administration, while Justice Clarence Thomas of the U.S. Supreme Court is listed as the \\"Best Boy\\" and is satirically depicted in a reader Q&A; session as incapable responding to any questions unrelated to pornography. U.S. Secy. of State Condoleezza Rice is an exception to the rule, but a poster once advertised on the site satirically depicted her exclaiming, \\"I'm fighting for WHITEY!\\" =Formats= * Speech Transcripts: One of the common strategies of the site was to publish news satire via fake press releases following a real event concerning the administration or its prominent supporters. Each fake press release purported to be the transcript of a speech, the minutes of a conversation or meeting, or an official governmental document. Each was accompanied by a doctored photograph providing a fictional visual scene for the occurrence. For example, after (in reality) Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court of the United States came under scrutiny for being a \\"hunting buddy\\" of U.S. Vice Pres. Dick Cheney while the Court was considering a case of Cheney's, Whitehouse.org included a fake dual statement titled \\"Joint Statement by Vice President Cheney and Justice Scalia Vigorously Defending the Propriety of Their Extracurricular Commingling\\" and accompanied with a false image of Cheney and Scalia together in a hot tub. * Interactive Forms: The site produced web-based forms to satirize official government online tools, including \\"American Patriot Registration\\", \\"Federal Judiciary Express Confirmation\\", and a \\"White House Press Pool Application\\". * \\"Ask The White House\\" Q&As;: Echoing a recurring feature of the same name on the official WhiteHouse.gov, WHITEHOUSE.ORG would solicit reader questions for dozens of members of the Bush Administration, then answer them in character on its own \\"Ask The White House\\". * Propaganda Posters: The site generated scores of satirical posters—many of which were photoshopped variations of actual classic World War II US Government propaganda posters—to critique and satirize the Bush administration. These frequently depicted President George W. Bush as childlike, jingoistic, and/or xenophobic. Sample poster slogans about Bush included \\"He volunteered for a beer run, and ended up running the world\\" and \\"Lookit Poppy—I can president all by myselfs!\\" * Micro-Sites: WHITEHOUSE.ORG would regularly launch ancillary parody websites at alternate web domains to house specific thematic content. These included a Bush/Cheney \\"Re-Selection\\" 2004 campaign website at georgewbush.org, CRONYJOBS.com—a parody of employment website hotjobs.com specifically for unqualified Bush appointees, and the sibling \\"abstinence-only\\" sex education programs \\"Iron Hymen\\" (for girls) and \\"Sex Is For Fags!\\" (for boys). =Conflict with the real office of Vice President Dick Cheney= WHITEHOUSE.ORG gained attention in the media in 2003, when one page on the website was the center of a dispute between Vice President Dick Cheney's Counsel, David Addington, and John A. Wooden, the Editor in Chief of Chickenhead Productions. Addington made what was likely a litigation threat intended to scare the authors into censoring the website. Addington's effort, whatever the intent, backfired. In December 2002, Addington sent a cease-and-desist letter to Wooden, arguing that certain characteristics of a satirical biography of Lynne Cheney (Dick Cheney's wife) on WHITEHOUSE.ORG were cause for litigation should Mrs. Cheney decide to file a lawsuit against Chickenhead Productions. Among the characteristics cited: photographs of her were used for a for-profit website without her permission; she was portrayed in the false biography \\"in a false light\\"; and that \\"few people are likely to notice your disclaimer link\\" and \\"even fewer are likely to click on the link and actually see the disclaimer.\\" Addington also cited the spoof of the Presidential seal was displayed on every page of the website, asserting such use of the seal was a violation of federal law. In conclusion, Addington demanded that Wooden delete the photographs and fictional text of the satirical page, and to fax him with notifications of the changes, but clarified that \\"nothing in this request should be construed as expressing the lawfulness, wrongfulness or inappropriateness, or not, of any other aspect of your website\\". WHITEHOUSE.ORG responded by doctoring photos of Lynne Cheney on the page with clown noses and the word \\"CENSORED\\", and by inserting a special disclaimer that read in part: WHITEHOUSE.ORG then satirized the incident in a fake \\"Statement by the Vice President\\" on February 20, 2003, titled \\"Irate Vice President Cheney Issues a Punctilious, Legally Precise 'Oh, Wise Guy, Eh? Why I Oughta!' Letter to Nefarious 'Whitehouse.org' Terror Portal!\\". Wooden also gave a copy of the letter to the New York City chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, who then went to the press to speak out in defense of WHITEHOUSE.ORG's First Amendment rights. Wooden discussed the events in interviews with Salon.com and CNN. In the wake of the controversy, staffers in Vice President Cheney's office disavowed knowledge of Addington's letter, telling the Washington Post, \\"We consider the matter closed.\\" =Spin-off book= In 2004, the Plume imprint of Penguin Group USA published the WHITEHOUSE.ORG spin-off book, llThe White House Inc. Employee Handbook: A Staffer's Guide to Success, Profit, and Eternal Salvation Inside George W. Bush's Executive Branchll. Written by John A. Wooden (Editor), Paul A. Bradley, John DeVore, and Chris Harper. =Theatrical production= In 2005, the site's \\"Reader Mail\\" feature, which regularly published e-mails from the general public—many intended for George W. Bush—was adapted into an off- Broadway show: \\"Dear Dubya: Patriotic Letters To WHITEHOUSE.ORG.\\" Written & Curated by John A. Wooden, Directed by R.J. Tolan and Produced by John DeVore, the show ran in an extended engagement, headlining \\"The Moral Values Festival\\" in Brooklyn, NY. The New York Times praised its ability to elicit \\"stunningly double-edged chortles\\", and NYT Chief Theatre Critic Ben Brantley picked the show for his short list of \\"potential cult hits.\\" =Late Bush hiatus and sign-off= After six years of regular and frequent updates, WHITEHOUSE.ORG ceased to be updated from September 14, 2007 until shortly before the inauguration of President Barack Obama. During the lengthy hiatus, on May 30, 2008, the site was briefly removed after being hacked and infected with trojan malware. While offline, the site displayed a warning page including the humorous suggestion that \\"communist Chineses\\" may be responsible, and indicating there would be no new updates until the web server is \\"back under our control\\". On January 20, 2009, for the last day of George W. Bush's presidency, the site signed off with two final updates: \\"Mrs. Bush Finalizes Details Of Her Forthcoming Blockbuster Memoir: 'How My Heroic Hubby Saved An Ungrateful World'\\", and a lengthy satirical farewell speech from the President, headlined \\"Full Text of President Bush's Emotional Farewell Speech Cataloguing His Unparalleled Competence and Intelligence.\\" Barack Obama Era For the first two years of the administration of Barack Obama, Internet traffic to WHITEHOUSE.ORG was redirected to the archived version of the George W. Bush version of the site at whitehouse.georgewbush.org. From 2011 through late 2016, attempts to access the website produced \\"Page Not Found\\" or \\"Site Cannot Be Reached\\" errors. Donald Trump Era In late December 2016, following an eight-year hiatus during the presidency of Barack Obama, the homepage of WHITEHOUSE.ORG began indicating \\"Coming Soon.\\" Shortly after the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January 2017, a logo for \\"TRUMP® WHITE HOUSE\\" appeared, accompanied by \\"Greatness. Coming Soon.\\" and a link to the website's Facebook page. On January 31, 2017, the website released a YouTube-hosted video entitled \\"Making WHITEHOUSE.ORG Great Again!\\" in which digitally manipulated video of President Donald Trump makes him appear to utter profanity and promise \\"I'm going to make the WHITEHOUSE.ORG great again, folks.\\" The video was accompanied by a link to a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, where the site's creators indicated: To avoid confusion between the parody and the actual White House website at www.whitehouse.gov, the word \\"PARODY\\" and a link to a disclaimer are listed at the bottom of each webpage.

Biography He descended from a third son of Sir Andrew Kerr of Ferniehurst, and was laird of Ancrum in Roxburghshire. He was born about 1578, and succeeded to the family estate in 1590 on the death of his father, who was assassinated on the orders of his kinsman, Robert Ker, younger of Cessford. Cessford's men ambushed William Kerr of Ancram on the stairs at the entry to his lodging and shot him with a pistol called a \\"dag\\".Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 430. He was cousin to Robert Carr, the favourite of James VI. Kerr appears to have also been honoured at an early age with court favour. Soon after the king's accession to the English throne, Kerr occupied a considerable station in the household of Prince Henry. He subsequently was employed by Prince Charles, who became his patron through life. Charles mediated the marriage between Sir Robert and the Lady Anne Stanley, daughter of the Earl of Derby. In 1620, Kerr was involved in a fatal quarrel with Charles Maxwell, who insinuated that he had slighted the Duke of Buckingham and insulted him without provocation as he entered the palace at Newmarket. In a duel that followed, Sir Robert killed Maxwell. Even though Maxwell's friends acquitted Kerr of blame, the king's strict rules for prevention and punishment of duels forced him to flee to Holland, where he remained about a year. During his exile, he collected pictures, for which, like his royal master, he had good taste. He eventually presented those he brought back with him to the prince. He was also distinguished by his literary taste and was a friend of John Donne. He also lived in Whitehall Palace and Kew. On the accession of Charles I to the throne, in 1625, Sir Robert Kerr was made a gentleman of the bedchamber. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Aylesbury in 1625, and for Lostwithiel and Preston in 1628.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/kerr- sir-robert-1578-1654 On 24 June 1633, when Charles was in Scotland at his coronation, Kerr was elevated to the peerage under the titles Earl of Ancram and Lord Kerr of Nisbet, Langnewton, and Dolphinstoun.David Laing, Correspondence of Sir Robert Kerr, first Earl of Ancram, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1875), p. xviii. Previously, his son William, by his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Murray of Blackbarony, had married his relative, Anne, Countess of Lothian in her own right, and had been, by the king, given the title Earl of Lothian.David Laing, Correspondence of Sir Robert Kerr, first Earl of Ancram, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1875), pp. xlviii, li. It was therefore arranged, in the patent granted to Kerr, that his own title should descend to the children of his second marriage. Thus, he was father of two peers. Unlike others who owed everything to this prince, the Earl of Ancram remained the prince's steady adherent during the whole of his troubles—though he was unable to prevent his eldest son, the Earl of Lothian, from acting a conspicuous part on the opposite side. On the death of King Charles, Kerr took refuge in Holland, where he spent the remainder of his days in solitary afflictions and poverty, and died in 1654, aged 76. Jan Lievens painted him marvelously. His son Charles, inherited his title, but ultimately merged with that of Lothian. Family He had two sons by his first marriage to Elizabeth Murray: *Stanley Kerr (d. bef. May 1672) *William Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian(bef. 1615 – c. October 1675) He had one son and two daughters by his second marriage to Anne, daughter of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby: *Charles Kerr, 2nd Earl of Ancram (6 August 1624 – September 1690) *Vere Kerr *Elizabeth Kerr References Category:1570s births Category:1654 deaths Category:Earls of Ancram Category:Knights of the Bath Category:Duellists Category:17th-century Scottish writers Category:People from Roxburgh Category:People from Surrey Category:English MPs 1625 Category:English MPs 1628–1629 ","title":"Robert Kerr, 1st Earl of Ancram"},{"id":"2009222","text":"Pitfield Street sign, Pit Village, Beamish Museum A pit village, colliery village or mining village is a settlement built by colliery owners to house their workers.

It started appearing in the Philippine Daily Inquirer on May 18, 1988, and was published exclusively in the Inquirer line of newspapers (Broadsheet Inquirer and its free concise sister tabloid called Inquirer Libre and tabloids Bandera and Tumbok.) Its popularity has spawned numerous compilations, a live-action television series, and merchandise such as T-shirts and figurines. The strip not only showcases domestic life; occasionally, it features adventure, drama, and pure spoof sequences. More often, the strip mirrors the general sentiment of the Filipino people on relevant topics such as corruption in the government as well as Filipino pop culture. In this respect, the strip has been likened to Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury.Quiambao, Cecilia (1993). \\"Pol Medina Jr. : It's A Swine's World.\\" Originally appeared in Preferences Magazine Accessed on August 5, 2007 Sometimes, political satire is woven into some ordinary strips and adventure stories. History Ragnarok has replaced patintero (a traditional game), video conferencing has replaced lunch meetings, and Google and Wikipedia have replaced the library!\\" Medina conceived the strip while working under contract in Iraq in 1986.pugad baboy eight On May 18, 1988, he pitched his strips to the Philippine Daily Inquirer. His strip, named after a friend's piggery in Bulacan, was accepted on the spot.Pugad Baboy X Medina originally spelled \\"Pugad Baboy\\" with a hyphen in the strip itself, though not in the title. For many years, the strip was exclusively a black-and-white daily. A full-color Sunday strip in the same paper debuted on October 3, 2004. The full-colored strips ended their run sometime in 2009. Before the tabloid Inquirer Libre debuted, the strip appeared exclusively in the Inquirer broadsheet. In a strip published in September 2006, Medina commented on online life substituting for physical contact. He mentioned Wikipedia as one of the alternatives to library visits, the other being Google. The Inquirer decided to discontinue carrying Pugad Baboy in its comics section beginning June 5, 2013, after a strip for the June 4 edition reportedly lambasted hypocrisy among Christians against homosexuals when certain sectarian schools condone such students among their ranks. The newspaper later clarified that the cartoonist was not actually fired and the strip would just be suspended from publication until an internal investigation had been carried out. However, Medina officially resigned from the paper on June 7, 2013. Online news website Rappler later hired him, with the strip being published as a webcomic on the site starting June 17, 2013. The new version offers readers alternative punchlines with the respective voting options. Its final strip on Rappler, depicting a portal, appeared on March 1, 2018. The strip returned to print media with its first appearance in the Philippine Star and its sister publications, Pilipino Star Ngayon and Pang-Masa, on March 5, 2018.Post from Pilipino Star Ngayon Facebook page. Mar 5, 2018. Retrieved Mar 9, 2018. CharactersThe Sungcals= The Sungcal family reflects aspects of traditional and stereotypical families, with a housewife and an overseas contract worker as members, with a domestic helper to supplement. \\"Sungkal\\" is a Tagalog word for the term \\"digging a hole with a (pig's) snout\\". *Dagul (Adagulfo Sungcal Jr.), often referred to with the title Mang (Mister) – i.e. Mang Dagul – The patriarch of the family. He works as a chef in a five-star hotel where he specializes in unorthodox dishes. He is often shown at home, usually voicing out on the state of affairs in the Philippines. He is also highly xenophobic. Over the years, he studies different martial arts like karate, arnis and aikido (like Medina), and he also dabbles in tennis and golf. He calls his wife \\"Honeycured.\\" \\"Dagul\\" is Filipino slang for someone or something big. At the end of The Returnee story arc, the Tangeres lend Dagul money so he can quit his job and start his own small restaurant in his house's front yard. *Debbie (Debra Anne Sungcal) – The matriarch of the family, a loving traditional housewife and mother. Her recurring traits include a love for bargain shopping, indecision regarding actual purchases (sometimes on purpose), and complaining about decisions she lets Dagul make (much to Dagul's annoyance and regret). Also, she extremely highly dislikes any honest opinion Dagul gives her about her figure and/or clothes she wears or tries on – to the point of throwing him out of the house, despite her demanding honest opinions in the first place. She is also the constant victim of disgusting table conversations between her husband, Polgas and sometimes with Utoy. She calls her husband \\"Sweet Ham.\\" *Kules (Hercules Sungcal) – The eldest son, a building engineer in Saudi Arabia. When not working, he reads letters from pen pals, goes on blind dates (usually with funny consequences), hangs out with his friend 'Adre (short for compadre; see below), or thinks about the events back in the Philippines. Much like Kules, Medina was formerly a contract worker in Saudi Arabia. The origin of his name is often mistaken to be that of the legendary Greek hero of the same name, when in fact, he is named after the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft. After marrying Mandana, Kules resigned from his overseas job and returned to Pugad Baboy for good, sporting longer hair. *Tiny (Cristina Sungcal) – The teenage daughter. Her name is not only an obvious misnomer, but also a testament to her vanity and denial regarding her size. She asserts herself as sexy and repeatedly insists that her waistline is 28 inches (the last time this was true was when she was 9 or 10 years old). She does commit herself to diets that often end in failure. Her cooking leaves much to be desired by her family, and is sometimes inedible (in one strip she naively uses papaya soap in place of the fruit). She studies in the University of Santo Tomas, where Medina graduated in 1983 with a degree in architecture. There, she takes up mass communication, a course the university does not actually offer. She is currently being courted by Brando, whose name is always mistaken by Bab and Dagul, and Tiny correcting them all the time. But in the beginning she allowed herself to be courted by Bab, and this happened only for a short period of time. She also is a cosplaying enthusiast. *Utoy (Adagulfo Sungcal III) – The youngest son. Intelligent and musically talented (playing the saxophone), he behaves much like other children his age. Medina initially depicted him as a clueless infant, but he later aged him to about eight years old probably to give a child's insight on current events (eight is also the age of most of the child characters in this strip). Despite his youth, he claims Jolen as his girlfriend. In a \\"Boy Scout\\" story arc, Medina gives him an absurdly versatile Swiss Army Knife (apart from the usual tools, his knife comes equipped with such things as a refrigerator, a Nintendo video game console complete with television, and an all-terrain vehicle).Pugad Baboy 3 The tool returns in Pugad Baboy 25 with a mini-sniper rifle that fires foam pellets. *Mandana (Mandana Ahmadi-Sungcal) – Kules' wife, and a spy of Iranian origin. Known as the \\"most hated by the Muslims who give Islam a bad name,\\" Mandana amassed a huge amount of fortune from collecting bounties of famous terrorists. Among her modus operandi is to convince wives of terrorists to betray them and become her informant. How and when she fell in love with Kules is unknown, but she ordered her partner Amir to offer Kules dowries to marry her. When a group of Islamists kidnapped Kules and ordered Mandana to bomb the US Embassy in exchange for her fiance's life, she did not hesitate and obliged. She was assumed killed in action - Kules shot her to save the Embassy, though the boat she was piloting still destroyed it. However, it was later revealed that she faked her death in order to deceive the Muslim extremists on her trail, and that what Kules shot was a dummy. It was heavily implied that non-terrorist casualties in the Embassy destruction were faked also in order to throw off the Muslim extremists. She re-emerged and reunited with Kules after five years, marrying in a civil ceremony in Tagaytay. She can finally speak Tagalog fluently, as seen in the March 21, 2016 strip here and as of January 25, 2018 here, she's pregnant with her and Kules' first child. She gave birth to a girl, while Kules was away. *Zara (Lazara Armaiti Sungcal) – Kules and Mandana's infant daughter. She took a lot from her Iranian heritage and her mother's temperament. She never once cried since her birth, something that Mandana claimed she got from her while admitting that her first time crying was when she shot her father who forcefully arranged her to marry an old man. Polgas Polgas (derived from the Spanish and Tagalog pulgas for \\"flea\\") is the Sungcals' anthropomorphic family dog. Notable for his human characteristics such as speech, optional bipedalism, use of clothing and general behavior, he is called ang asong hindi (the dog who isn't) in material outside the strip proper because of his human characteristics. He acts as an extra member of the Sungcals and is his master Dagul's drinking buddy. However, he still behaves like a typical dog when he chooses to, though usually when he takes a bite out of people or leaks on them, most often Dagul. Polgas was initially a normal dog which walked on all fours, albeit one who wore shirts and undershirts like Dagul.Pugad Baboy One (The Very Best of Pugad Baboy) Medina eventually gave him the ability to talk, followed by other human characteristics like a more humanlike physique. Originally, Brosia, a former ventriloquist, supplied Polgas's voice, but Medina was so dissatisfied with the idea that he abandoned it completely. Medina later explained in a 1995 spin-off graphic novel entitled Pirata that Polgas developed human characteristics due to his master's exotic version of bibingka (rice cake) and exposure to radiation emitted by television sets. Apparently, the combination had a teratogenic effect on him, somewhat similar to the mutation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.Pirata Medina eventually developed the character into a \\"man (dog) of action\\", humorously saving the human characters from danger during story arcs,The Best of Pugad Baboy and later a full-fledged action hero involved with more serious activities. Polgas became a deep penetration agent of a fictional military division called the Organized Canine Bureau (OCB). This organization spoofs the TV series Wiseguy, which features a fictional branch of the FBI called the Organized Crime Bureau, responsible for the protagonist Vinnie Terranova's activities. Medina's OCB was originally formed to combat the pilfering of stray dogs being sold in Metro Manila for their meat. Wisedog's second mission took place in Baguio, where the selling and eating of dog meat is an illegal industry. (See The Baguio Connection). Polgas's original call sign in the OCB was Wisedog (a homage to Wiseguy). Later, he changed his call sign to Dobermaxx after he and some other residents of Pugad Baboy were accidentally sent to and returned from the year 2078. Subsequently, he is sometimes referred to as \\"Agent Delta\\" or simply \\"Delta\\".Kinse! As an agent, Polgas was issued with a prototype garapata (tick) gun, which shoots droplets of tick sweat that causes itching that lasts for six months. Later, he was issued a tiny surveillance robot flea named \\"Gary\\"Pugad Baboy 4 and ballistic arnis sticks. After his first mission, he was issued a customized Porsche 959, the Thunderdog. As a result, from his adventure in 2078, he acquired a technologically advanced garapata gun.Pugad Baboy 5 Later he also acquired the Thunderpuppy, a Harley Davidson V-Rod motorcycle. As Wisedog/Dobermaxx, Polgas has fought many foes over the years, ranging from the mundane (drug pushers) to the fantastic (a lord of supernatural creatures). His most prominent foe is Atong Damuho (Renate Domingo), erstwhile drug pusher, dognapper, illegal loggerPugad Baboy XI and most recently, magic mushroom courier. He appears in many other guises such as Dr. Sigmund Floyd (a spoof of Sigmund Freud), Pol Torero (World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE's The Undertaker), Amorsolo (a non-existent Ninja Turtle), Aquapol (Aquaman), Growlsbuster (spoofing The Ghostbusters), Darth Paul (spoofing Darth Maul), Polverine (a spoof of Wolverine, an X-Men character) and many others. =The Tangaras= The Tangaras are two siblings from Gingoog City that both share a close relationship with the Sungcals, they are one of Pugad Baboy's few thin, slim residents. Their surname is a play on tanga, a Tagalog word for \\"stupid\\". *Brosia (Ambrosia Tangara) – The Sungcal family's housemaid. She is brainless, as characterized by her nonsensical remarks and her mesmerization by reading materials in English. Medina eventually elaborated on this trait and said she couldn't afford to advance her studies. She does possess excellent math skills regarding financial issues such as bank accounts, deposits, salary computations, currencies, etc. As said by Dagul in Pugad Baboy 17, \\"'Pag sa pera nga pala 'di ka tanga no?\\" (\\"So, you're not dumb when it comes to money, huh?\\") She makes up for her general lack of intelligence (or formal schooling) with witty jokes, insults and pranks on the community's various residents. Her most frequent victim is Dagul, whose semi-baldness becomes the butt of her jokes, much to his chagrin. As revealed in The Bourney Ambrosity, there was an attempt by Polgas to recruit Brosia in the OCB, under the codename of \\"Amrita\\", but she was unable to absorb any of the physical, linguistic, and technical training, or so they thought; the amnesia inflicted on her in the storyline brings out this myriad of abilities, including dealing with English, but appear to be inaccessible if her original Brosia persona is active. *'Adre (Cesar \\"Butch\\" Tangara) – Brosia's older brother and Kules's best friend and fellow worker in Saudi Arabia. He shares the same interests and sentiments with Kules, sometimes with photos of their penpals. His relation to Brosia was revealed when he went home to the Philippines for a vacation (Kules was also home at the time). Adre is now also resigned from a job in Saudi Arabia following his best friend's wedding and now currently resides back to the Philippines for good. 'Adre is short for kumpadre or male best friend. =The Sabaybunots= The Sabaybunots reflect a very violent but tolerably quiet household. \\"Sabay, bunot!\\" is used by the Philippine military as an oral Tagalog command during martial ceremonies when the drawing of weapons is called for, as in the drawing of officers' swords. It roughly means \\"draw simultaneously\\". This may be in homage to Tomas' military background. *Tomas, also known as Sarge (M/Sgt. Tomas Sabaybunot) – Representing the Philippine's military branch, he is a master sergeant of the Philippine Air Force. While said to be fearless and often trigger-happy, his \\"chauvinist pig\\" lifestyle is ironically neutralized by his dominant wife. He is often reduced to doing inane chores, and any attempt to complain about said chores results in physical battery by his wife, hilariously, to the point of that he considers wartime more peaceful than his domestic life. His name could be a pun on toma, Filipino slang for alcoholic drinks; Tomas does like to drink a lot, as does his cousin Igno. Tomas also likes to spend his \\"extra time\\" at disco bars, though this occasionally leads him to having gout. And though he has a large collection of guns, he suffers from a severe fear of needles. At the end of The Returnee story arc, Tomas retired from the military service following his new business, a new coffee plantation and a new military training facility in Cavite. The Tangeres' new farm is right beside his new place. He was stuck in Master Sergeant rank, joking that if he became a pimp to an officer who was unnamed, he will be promoted. *Barbie (Barbara Q. Sabaybunot) – Tomas's wife. She frequently orders Tomas around, probably due to his chauvinism, his womanizing, and her extremely feministic views. This difference of opinion often turns into a physical altercation, such as Barbie giving a tiptoeing Tomas her trademarked uppercut whenever he arrives home in the wee hours of the morning drunk and/or smeared with the scent of women's perfume. Her maiden name (Barbie Q.) is a pun on barbecue. In Pugad Baboy 18, her first name was rendered \\"Barbara- Queen\\" (possibly after a local barbecue franchise called Grill Queen). She often spends her free time doing physical workouts (lifting weights, etc.). She is also hinted as a born-again Christian, as she holds or attends prayer meetings, and describes Tomas as \\"born-against,\\" because of his sinful ways. Even in the realm of weapons, Barbie outguns her husband. Tomas is usually portrayed with his service pistol while Barbie often has an Uzi. Recently, Barbie was pregnant and born twin boys, which Tomas wanted to reach out for his friends for names, rejecting Noli's name Carl and Marcus, names made from Karl Marx. *Paltik (Paul Thomas Sabaybunot), the couple's eldest son. While his friend Utoy can be described as the \\"brains\\", he can be described as the \\"jester\\". Quite mischievous in many ways, he often sleeps in class and is clearly much more interested in other areas, such as teasing his buck-toothed teacher, Miss Nobatos, typically comparing her face to that of a horse. He is also fond of bribing and blackmailing his own father, usually in exchange for some pocket money or other favors. His nickname is a Filipino term that means \\"homemade gun.\\" The Philippine military also uses the term paltik to specifically refer to a handgun. The name is probably used by the cartoonist in reference to Paltik being a smaller version of his father, Tomas, who always likes to carry big guns. *Darius and Draven (Darius Gerardo and Draven Bertino Sabaybunot), the couple's infant twin sons. Their first names were derived after the characters from League of Legends courtesy of Paltik while their second names are a nod after Barbie's twin uncles. Igno Igno (Benigno Ramos; not to be confused with the Sakdalista movement founder of the same name) – Introduced to the series in 1998 as a bodyguard for Mao's son Jong, Igno is Tomas' cousin and an ex-convict from the actual National Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa. He claims he was incarcerated because of a Breach of Contract with his former boss, who employed him as a bodyguard. Possibly due to his being an ex-convict, he is actually more competent in survival skills than his cousin. He specializes in \\"improvised weapons employment\\", and even took a part-time job as a bounty hunter at one time in order to earn some cash. He drinks very often, but is afraid of ghosts and the supernatural. In fact, his frequent drinking caused his breath, blood and urine to become highly flammable, especially while drunk. Igno is also extremely tough and invulnerable, able to shrug off most things that, at worst, would have destroyed a normal person's body. His name is a play on ignoramus. At the end of the Returnee, Igno starts his own high-tech greenhouse beside his kubo. During the epilogue chapters of the \\"Dugo ng Shinobi\\" Arc, 33 years later, an aged Igno is still seen to be in good health despite his history of maintaining a very dangerous and unhealthy lifestyle. =The Lamouns= Lamon is a Tagalog verb meaning \\"to eat [food] in great quantities\\", or more loosely, \\"pig out\\", and is commonly used as a label pertaining to one's gluttony. The surname was spelled \\"Lamon\\" at first. *Bab (Roberto Lamoun) – the resident true-blue hippie who is lazy and unemployed, although he sometimes moonlights as a folk singer and part-time PE teacher at Utoy, Paltik, and Joma's school. He is also unlucky in love, especially with Tiny, who was once his girlfriend for only two seconds. He has applied for and held many jobs over the years, but these never get off the ground. His job undertakings are described as \\"first-day, last-day\\" as he is often fired on his first day at work. Bab is usually referred by the rest of the community as a bad example and an occasional drug addict. When a story focuses on his addiction, he is said to be \\"using\\" marijuana (though one never actually sees him \\"using\\" the drug) and is sometimes seen with several marijuana leaves in his possession. Bab has also gotten himself infected with gonorrhea (shown in a minor arc in Pugad Baboy 19) and other sexually transmitted diseases on occasion. At the end of The Returnee story arc, the Tangeres lend Bab money so he can start his own artisanal bakery. *Jolen (Joanne Elena Lamoun) – Bab's much younger sister. She is more intelligent than Bab (or at least more diligent), and is often reminded by their mother never to follow in her brother's footsteps, despite the many realities her brother himself imparts to her. She is also Utoy's girlfriend and often goes out with him, though they are both only eight to nine years old. She has a speech impediment as she pronounces her k's and s's as t's. However, this only manifests itself while she is singing. Jolen or holen is the Filipino term for marbles. *Tita Cel (Cecilia Lamoun) – Bab and Jolen's mother. She disapproves of her son and dotes on her daughter. She despises Bab's smoking vice, as this led to the death of her husband (Rodrigo Lamoun, as mentioned in Pugad Baboy XI). She has no qualms in hiding her disappointment of her near-useless son and states it outright, as seen in Pugad Baboy X. *Daddy (Rodrigo Lamoun) – Bab and Jolen's late father, and Tita Cel's husband. In one strip, it is mentioned that he died of lung cancer while working as a rabbit farmer in Tagaytay. Hence how he is used as a scare tactic by Tita Cel whenever she catches her son smoking, to no avail. It is also mentioned in one arc by Polgas (posing as Dr. Sigmund Floyd)that Bab's only fear is his father. =The Tangeres= *Ka Noli (Nolasco M. Tangere) – the resident communist who is a proud member of the New People's Army. While he believes in the merits of communism and calls most of the other residents capitalists, not only does he manage to have drinking sessions with them, but he is also very good friends with them. Tomas, a natural enemy, is his best friend. Ironically, Medina says he and his son enjoy playing Monopoly. As time went on, his espousing of his beliefs occurred less and less frequently to the point of readers being reminded that he is of the NPA only in the most subtle of situations. As such, jokes about his Ilocano heritage and the mountain-based lifestyle that comes of being in the NPA are often cracked at his expense instead. Because of him, Tomas is able to find allies in the NPA whenever the need arises, such as in Retraining, though not always. His name is derived from the title of Noli Me Tangere, the first novel of the Philippine national hero, Jose Rizal. Recent strips have shown that Ka Noli and his wife Ka Beza had officially defected from the New People's Army, as of Pugad Baboy: The Returnee 122, updated November 29, 2016 at Rappler.com. They started their own farm beside Tomas' new training facility, specializing in exotic animals. Because they still hold socialist beliefs, they also lend money to other Pugad Baboy residents such as Dagul and Bab, so that their business benefits their neighbors and friends as well. *Joma (Jose Maria Tangere) – Ka Noli and Ka Beza's eldest son. While he is aware of his father's beliefs, he hangs out with Utoy and Paltik often and attends the same school they do. He is named after Jose Maria \\"Joma\\" Sison, founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines. *Ka Beza (Bezalie Tangere), Ka Noli's wife, who appears to have an \\"allergic reaction to soldiers,\\" resulting in Tomas being her target practice whenever she's around. Just like her husband Nolasco, she had also defected from the New People's Army (as of Pugad Baboy: The Returnee 122, updated November 29, 2016 at Rappler.com.) Her name \\"Ka Beza\\", is a reference to the word Cabeza, which means, \\"The head of a small town/county or barangay\\". *Melo (Marx Engels Tangere), Ka Noli and Ka Beza's infant son. His name is a reference to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, co-authors of the Communist Manifesto. =The Tangs= *Mao (Mauricio Tang) – the resident Chinese-Filipino who hails from Fujian Province and owns a sari- sari store (a small retail store) in Pugad Baboy. He often believes in business sense, earning money and he sometimes brandishes a sword on whoever earns his ire, especially those who do not pay their dues. His name is play on ma-utang, which in Tagalog, translates roughly to \\"one who likes to borrow money.\\" *Pao (Paulino Tang) – the resident homosexual and Mao's son. A friend of Tiny, his tastes and attitude are typically gay. This even caused him trouble once when he was mistaken for a pregnant woman by a horde of monsters and he did not want to admit his real gender. His father once expressed disappointment over him as he remarked that Pao has a resemblance to basketball player \\"Gelli Codiñela.\\" He also owns a beauty parlor and works his way through college at the same time. His name is a play on pa-utang, which, in Tagalog, translates roughly to \\"Can I borrow some money?\\". It is mentioned in one arc that he has a brother named \\"Jong\\" (Ji Ong) who works in Taiwan. *Coleen (Anne Coleen Tang) - Introduced to the strip in January 2013, Coleen is Pao's sister that stayed and studied in China. She is the opposite of Pao in some aspects, being a lesbian and possessing a very athletic body due to her vegetarianism. As evidenced in her exchanges with Father Marty, she's also an atheist. Her full name is a play of the Tagalog Phrase Ang Kulintang, \\"The Kulintang\\" (an indigenous musical instrument in Maguindanao, Philippines). *Jong (Jong Tang) - Mao's other son and Pao and Coleen's brother. He resides in Taiwan and was introduced during Pugad Baboy 11 when he pays his family in the Philippines a visit. Like his father, he's a clever and cunning businessman. =The Cabalfins= *Senator Cabalfin (Sen. Usurpo Cabalfin) – the resident member of the Philippine Senate. He is seen more playing children's games and spending people's taxes on his own indulgences rather than doing his job as a legislator. He is created by Medina as a reflection of corrupt government officials. His personal name Usurpo is derived from the word usurp. Cabalfin once served as the prime antagonist in the Conspigracy arc. *Madame Cabalfin (Diana Elizabeth Cabalfin), Senator Cabalfin's equally corrupt wife (based on Imelda Marcos). *Bong (Enrique Noel Cabalfin), Senator and Madame Cabalfin's son and Sen. Cabalfin's only legitimate child, who is not really part of the inner circle of the other four kids. =Other characters= *Joboy (Joey Boy Llabe) – the resident mechanic who has a knack for cars and often likes to drive fast (in fact, he is a speed maniac). His last name is the Filipino word for wrench, from the Spanish llave. Formerly the fattest resident of Pugad Baboy but due to acquiring Diabetes, his diet had reduced his weight significantly. *Father Marty (Fr. Mario Martinez), the town Priest and Bab's priest-friend, he studied canon law at the Vatican before moving back to Pugad Baboy. *Tata Mads (Amado Pascala) – the resident musician who once taught Tiny voice lessons and sometimes comes to Dagul to comment on his awful singing. His name is a play on tamad (\\"lazy\\") due to the seemingly easy-going lifestyle of musicians and other people in the field of creative arts; though his appearances in the strip have decreased over the years, he does not appear to be truly lazy. *Doc Sebo (Miguel Sebo, MD) – the resident physician who specializes in circumcision, but is generally shown to be weak and incompetent in anything else in his profession. In early strips, he prescribes only one kind of medicine – aspirin. Sebo is Tagalog for congealed fat or solidified lard. *Miss Nobatos (Eusebia Nobatos) – Utoy, Paltik, Joma, and Jolen's teacher. She often rages at Paltik for his jokes and actions, particularly when he refers to her as a horse, and takes too many doses of aspirin because of him and any other shenanigans her other students cause. Her name is a play on the Spanish term novatos, meaning \\"new race horse.\\" *Patrolman Durugas (PFC Romeo Durugas) – a police officer who often apprehends drivers mostly for no apparent reason and receives bribes from them. Dagul happens to be one of those disgruntled motorists. He is created by Medina based on the Filipinos' general view on policemen as corrupt. In Tagalog, mandurugas means \\"one who cheats\\". =Recurring minor characters= There are also recurring characters in the strip, including: *Barbie's mother (unnamed), the stereotypical mother-in-law for Tomas from Parañaque who rues about death and her home city's water problem; *Dagul's mother (Brenda), an ironically thin yet overly concerned woman; *Boy Bura and Boy Tibar (real names never mentioned), bodyguards of the Cabalfin family; *Lucio (last name never mentioned), Sen. Cabalfin's accountant; *Attorney Adriano (first name never mentioned), the fiscal; *Doctor Rosa, a dentist who scares her patient with a pair of dental pliers whenever she gets agitated or teased by the characters; *\\"Principal Schwarzenegger\\" (Arnold Palacio), the ugly school principal who is as exasperated as Miss Nobatos when it comes to seeing Paltik in his office; *Nadir Hamid Mohammad, Kules's employer and is the subject of many smelly jokes as part of the Filipino stereotypical view that Arabs are foul-smelling; *Jacques Vousvoulez, Dagul's French employer and the head chef of the hotel where Dagul works. His name is a French stylization of \\"bubuli\\", the Filipino word for skink. It was revealed by Debbie that his wife's name is Fifi; *Rosanna (last name not mentioned), a buxom local mestiza, who as part of a running gag, is a frequent victim of coconut thieves (often Bab, Tomas and Igno) but not before being viewed naked by these thieves through her window. Her character and name are based on the sexy Filipina actress, Rosanna Roces; *Frostee (a play on the word prostitute, of which she is), the sexy Japayuki (a female Filipino worker in Japan); *Mang Igme (full name never mentioned), a fishball vendor who believes that the fishball industry is the solution to the poverty in the Philippines; *Brando, Tiny's current boyfriend, being a chef from Malate has unfortunately earned him the ire of the very much paranoid Mang Dagul, who feels the former will replace him as the family's chef. However, Dagul seems to have grown a little more comfortable with him as he no longer seems to hold anything against him sometimes; *The Los Kosas Muntinlupas, a trio of fellow ex-inmates and Igno's supposed friends. Wakali who is bald and has a mole on his nose, Lino who is the skinny one, and Don who has a shaved head and moustache. Though they have appeared on previous book covers and have a cameo appearance in Benigno Ramos: Bounty Hunter, they are introduced properly in Pugad Baboy XX; *Dado (Dado Galang, M.D.), a practicing veterinarian, Dado's most notable trait is an unusual brand of lycanthropy -a result of his mother's maternal craving for dog meat- which he can control and benefit from outside his werewolf form in terms of his sensory abilities. Originating from Pampanga, he has since moved to Manila and occasionally returns to aid Polgas in other battles, such as in The Bourne Ambrosity; and others. *Amir Saeed – Mandana's partner and subordinate. It was revealed by Polgas that he is British-Pakistani. His surname, however, was not revealed. *Ms. Winnie Catala - Pugad Baboy Academy Librarian. Only seen in some few strips in various book compilations. Her name was revealed in Pugad Baboy 24, page 2. She despises loud noises and unruly behavior inside the Pugad Baboy Library. *Penny - the newest character of Pugad Baboy and she was introduced to the strip in December 2016, dubbed as a small female person, she was a cashier in Bab's Bakeshop, she's previously worked with Pao in a Beauty Hair Salon, and she's also Bab's secretary, accountant and saleswoman in the bakeshop. *Osep – the delivery and errand boy of Bab's Bakeshop. An impatient and short-tempered PWD with Poliomyelitis. *Ken – a deaf PWD who works as a waiter for the restaurant of the Sungcals. *Alice – Doc. Sebo's Nurse. An outstanding Nurse despite having Down syndrome. *Annie – the Head of Charcuterie at the Tangere Family's Farm. Despite being blind, she had a very keen sense of smell and revealed herself to be a psychic. *Mr. Severo Morales – the resident bitter old man. He is judgmental and cares a lot of being politically correct. His favorite pastime is visiting popular websites looking for comments that can offend him in order to have an excuse to enter an argument. *Nash – Coleen's Dwarf friend. Initially, he was dismissed as a figment of Coleen's imagination until Annie, revealed to have a Third Eye confirmed his existence. *Pablo – the local Shinobi and later Samurai vigilante that protects the Pugad Baboy's indigenous settlement, 'Manggahan' from evil elements. Other minor characters in the strips serve as antagonists to the residents. See: Villains of Pugad Baboy. On the other hand, the Pugad Baboy gang are often aided by friends and acquaintances they meet during these escapades. See each article of the story arcs for info on these allies. Prominent personalities, both local and foreign, have also made cameo appearances in Pugad Baboy. Among them are presidents Ramos, Estrada, and Arroyo, martial artist Ernesto Presas, politicians Robert Jaworski, Rene Saguisag and Richard Gordon, singer Freddie Aguilar, comedian Leo Martinez, boxer Manny Pacquiao, Pope John Paul II, Mel Gibson, and Michael Jackson. Medina drew many of the above minor characters for the covers of some compilations, but these did not appear in the selected strips. Some of these appeared either earlier in the comic strip's run (such as Father Marty) while others were just mere extras (such as the Los Kosas Muntinlupas, Igno's former fellow inmates in Bilibid Prison). Many of these were only given official names in \\"character guide\\" supplements in compilations (such as the inmates and the school principal, mostly hitherto unnamed). These names are then carried over to future strips. Stylistic elements British English words are prevalent in the strip (like -ise words) and Medina uses these kinds of words in his own write-ups. =Age= The characters are typically ageless, and their actual ages are usually vague. The few characters whose present ages are stated are Dagul (48), and the kids (8 or 9). Utoy and 'Adre are the only characters to have visibly aged in the strip through the years, barring flashbacks (Utoy first appeared as a baby; 'Adre has lately lost some of his hair). A \\"holdover hippie\\" from the 1960s, Bab nevertheless seems to be only in his twenties or thirties, which would be impossible in real life. In the early-1990s story arc Ang Hiwaga ng Dueñas (published in Pugad Baboy 4) the faith healer Mang Danilo, an old acquaintance, mentions that Bab was teenaged at the time of Woodstock (Bab immediately covers the faith healer's mouth as the word \\"Woodstock\\" is mentioned). A series of strips published in Pugad Baboy X (1998) implies that Bab is at least over 28 years old. In the same compilation, Tita Cel mentions that Jolen is 27 years younger than Bab and since the stock age of the Pugad Baboy children is 8–9, Bab is possibly 35–36. The first volume of the Polgas Comics collections has a story called \\"Class Reunion\\" illustrated by Jerald Dorado which has Bab attending an elementary class reunion for the 'Batch of 1969' which further enforces this view of his age. =Recurring jokes= One of the strip's running gags is the depiction (or at least the description) of Arabs having very foul body odor. Examples of this running gag are Kules' Saudi friend, which the former calls Lancaster (because the friend smells like the langka or jack fruit), and the stinky concentrated chemical agent PSSI (pawis ng singit ng sundalong Iraqi or Iraqi soldier's jock sweat) mentioned in the story arc The Baguio Connection. This running gag is likely based on the author's personal experience. It is also reasonable, considering that the desert atmosphere in most Arab countries prevents their people from taking daily baths. Other such gags include the monotonous diet of chicken in Saudi Arabia (also likely based on personal experience), Paltik's blatant aversion to the \\"coming of age\\" ritual of circumcision, and Polgas and Dagul de-appetizing Debbie on the breakfast table. And steriotyped Iraqis are seen in earlier works. =Authorial presence= Medina usually voices out his takes on events, people and the like through Polgas and Mang Dagul. (Polgas is also recurringly shown as a comic strip artist, like his creator.) According to Medina, the characters he most identifies with are Polgas, Mang Dagul, and Utoy; like him, they wear earrings on their left ears.Pugad Baboy 9 Medina himself has even appeared once in the strip proper, holding a cartooning workshop in Palawan, though he avoids breaking the fourth wall by not referring to himself as the strip's creator.Pugad Baboy XII Major story arcs As mentioned earlier in this article, the strip does not showcase domestic life alone as Medina has created story arcs which involve the various characters in adventurous, dramatic or other plotted situations. There is no standard as how long a story arc may last, since it can run from several weeks to a few months. The story arc is only titled when it is included in a compilation.

Not included in the list above is Planet of the Dogs, Medina's homage/parody to Planet of the Apes. This story arc (which appeared in Disi-Sais!) is relatively short at only nine strips long. Since that arc, it took Medina three years before he came up with Benigno Ramos: Bounty Hunter, and then another three with Bodyguard. Books and merchandise The first compilation of Pugad Baboy comic strips was originally part of a thesis by Frank Aldana, a student of De La Salle University. This compilation became so popular that Medina himself made more. Typically, a new compilation is released near the start of each year. Including Aldana's compilation, there are currently 34 Pugad Baboy compilation books: *Pugad Baboy One (originally, The Very Best of Pugad Baboy) *The Best of Pugad Baboy (officially, this is the second compilation) *Pugad Baboy 3 *Pugad Baboy 4 *PB5 (Pugad Baboy 5) *Pugad Baboy 6 *Pugad Baboy 7 *pugad baboy eight *Pugad baboy 9 *Pugad Baboy X (commemorating the tenth anniversary of the comic strip) *Pugad Baboy XI *Pugad Baboy XII *PB the 13th (Pugad Baboy 13) *Katorse (Pugad Baboy 14) *Kinse! (Pugad Baboy 15) *Disi- Sais! (Pugad Baboy 16) *17 (Pugad Baboy 17) *18 eighteen (Pugad Baboy 18) *Pugad Baboy Sunday Comics (first one in full color) *Pugad Baboy nineteen *Pugad Baboy XX (commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the comic strip) *Pugad Baboy 21 *Pugad Baboy 22 *Pugad Baboy Sunday Comics 2 (second one in full color) *Pugad Baboy 23 *Pugad Baboy 24 * 25 (Pugad Baboy 25) *Pugad Baboy Sunday Comics 3 (half colored, half not colored. This is the last of the Sunday Comics Series) *26 (Pugad Baboy 26) *27 (Pugad Baboy 27) *28 (Pugad Baboy 28) *29 (Pugad Baboy 29) *XXX (Pugad Baboy 30th Anniversary Special) *Pugad Baboy 31 Medina also made other Pugad Baboy original works: *Pugad Baboy: Endangered Species - a coloring book by Pol Medina. *Pugad Baboy: Philippine Games - another coloring book by Medina. *Pirata – an original graphic novel about Polgas befriending a reformed Muslim pirate named Khalid and their quest for the pirate group to surrender. It was intended to be the first of a graphic novel series called Polgas – Ang Asong Hindi, but was made a stand-alone graphic novel because of the time and effort given to its creation, as well as the seriousness and darkness of its story compared to the hilarity of Pugad Baboy itself. * Two Polgas – Ang Asong Hindi books actually appeared, sporting a smaller, regular-sized format than Pirata. Printed in black and white, unlike Pirata, they were produced as a joint effort between Medina and the Alamat Comics Group, an independent comics company. These books were Baboyani (a portmanteau of baboy and bayani, Filipino for \\"hero\\") an alternate universe adventure which recasts the characters as rebels in the late-19th century Philippine Revolution against Spanish rule; and Conspigracy, a story that takes place during an excursion in Laguna. Nolan Clemente (who is credited as Medina's inspiration for the character Ka Noli) wrote the scripts for both books. In actuality, Medina only contributed the art for the covers and title pages; the rest of the art was done by other artists. The afterword for the second book teased the production of a third story which would supposedly see the Pugad Baboy characters go into space, but this was never produced. Christmas-themed Polgas P-gurine c. 1995 *Pugad Baboy Adbyenturs featuring an original story called Gayuma, set sometime after Pugad Baboy 3. The story had Bab finally succeed in convincing Tiny to fall in love with him, while also coming up against a familiar foe. The comic was illustrated in full color by artists from Alamat, where Medina was only somewhat involved. The story was written by Eric Santos, who also co-wrote Conspigracy. *Polgas comics – a \\"magazine\\" of original strips by Medina and other artists which also contained a spoof \\"horoscope\\" and some exotic recipes, saw at least two issues. The popularity of Pugad Baboy also spawned some merchandise such as DogStyle Apparel and Polgas P-gurines (a set of figurines depicting Polgas and some Polgas characters). They are currently distributed by Medina's company, Pol Medina Jr. Novelties. On September 25, 1993, Pugad Baboy was made into a live- action TV show called Rated PB (Pang-Bayan) – Pugad Baboy Sa TV. Directed by Leo Martinez, the show featured Edgar Mortiz (Bab), Giselle Sanchez (Brosia) and Rudy Meyer (Mang Dagul) among the cast. Though the show was live-action, the opening logo featured limited animation. Some of the episodes were based upon earlier plots in the strip, while others followed a skit show format. It was aired on GMA 7 and lasted only two seasons, 15 episodes in all. In the ninth book, Medina states that he dreams of making a Pugad Baboy cartoon. Besides Pugad Baboy books, Medina has also published compilations of his editorial cartoons for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, called the Ink and Politics series. The cartoons sometimes feature Pugad Baboy characters. Polgas always appears on covers of these books. Three books have been published as the newspaper stopped hiring him as substitute political cartoonist in around 2006. Medina includes photos and caricatures of himself in some of the strip's compilations. Some Pugad Baboy characters can be seen on the ads of Dencio's, a notable restaurant chain in the Philippines. They are also featured as endorsers of Quake Overload Cakes, a line of pastries made by snack company Jack 'N Jill. Animation has been done by another great Pinoy artist, Arnold Arre ReferencesExternal links *Pol Medina's official website *Unofficial Website of Pugad Baboy Category:1988 comics debuts Category:Philippine culture Category:Philippine comic strips Category:Philippine Daily Inquirer Category:Fictional families Category:Comics about married people Category:Fictional Filipino people Category:Satirical comics Category:Humor comics Category:Political comic strips Category:Slice of life comics Category:Comics set in the Philippines ","title":"Pugad Baboy"},{"id":"2009231","text":"Martinus Christian Wesseltoft Rørbye (17 May 1803 – 29 August 1848) was a Danish painter, known both for genre works and landscapes. He was a central figure of the Golden Age of Danish painting during the first half of the 19th century. The most traveled of the Danish Golden Age painters, he traveled both north to Norway and Sweden and south to Italy, Greece and Constantinople. He was also the first Danish painter to take to painting in Skagen at the northern top of Jutland, almost half a century before the thriving community of Skagen Painters formed and came to fame, through Michael Ancher, Anna Ancher and P.S. Krøyer. Early life and education View from the Artist's Window Martinus Rørbye was born in Drammen in Norway on 17 May 1803 to Danish parents Ferdinand Henrik Rørbye and his wife Frederikke Eleonore Catherine de Stockfleth. Martinus was not inclined to schooling, but in 1820 started his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at 17 years of age. He studied under Christian August Lorentzen and Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, a strong influence on a generation of artists during the Danish Golden Age. Rørbye was a favorite student of Eckersberg, and they formed a close association. He took to Eckersberg's careful attention to nature and his strivings to capture details realistically. He was also greatly influenced by Lorentzen's use of color. He won the Academy's small silver medal in 1824, and the large silver medal in 1828. He competed for the gold medal and won a cash prize. In 1829 he won the small gold medal for his painting Christ healing the blind, which remains in the ownership of the Royal Danish Academy. He never won the large gold medal in spite of repeated attempts. View from the Artist's Window, is a painting by a young Rørbye around 1825, heralding the many travels he would later make with its depiction of a caged bird in an open window, on the border between the safety of his parents' home and the wide, unknown world represented by a berthed ship. Early career View from the Citadel Ramparts in Copenhagen by Moonlight Rørbye first exhibited his paintings at Charlottenborg in 1824 and would do so almost every year until 1848. His works were modestly priced, and he found sufficient buyers for his pieces. The majority of his works in the 1820s consisted of views from Copenhagen and the island of Zealand, although he also painted a number of portraits including one of Lorentzen, his painting instructor. Twice, in 1830 and 1832, he traveled to Norway. On the first of these journeys he visited Jutland on the way, a rare destination for painters at that time. On 31 May 1830 he went to Århus on the paddle steamer Dania. Another passenger on the ship was Hans Christian Andersen and the two artists decided to travel together for a while. From Århus they went north, staying at the Rosenholm, Clausholm and Tjele estates. After that, Rørbye and Andersen parted with Rørbye, continuing to the remote and seldom-visited Thy province of north- western Jutland to visit relatives in Thisted. From his journals it can be concluded that he found the place deeply exotic, making detailed sketches and notes of everything from women's costumes and markets to the scenery. However, he found the landscape unsuitable for painting due to the lack of trees. On 7 July he left Thisted bound for Norway. In Norway he painted landscapes under the influence of Johan Christian Dahl and Caspar David Friedrich. Adventurous travels and later career A company of Danish artists in Rome In 1834 Rørbye received a travel scholarship from the Academy on account of his talents as a portraitist. He traveled by way of the Netherlands and France to Rome, In Paris he met Peter Andreas Heiberg, August Bournonville and the French painter Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. When he arrived in Rome, he joined the city's thriving Danish artists community which had Bertel Thorvaldsen as its central figure. A Group of Danish Artists in Rome, is a painting depicting the artist in Rome, painted by Constantin Hansen. Rørbye is number two from the left sitting behind Bindesbøll who is lying on the floor with a fez he often wore after their visit to Constantinople. Also appearing in the picture are the painter himself, Marstrand, Küchler, Blunck and Jørgen Sonne, sitting on the table. In Italy he traveled to Sorrento, the Sabine Mountains, and Sicily. The following year Rørbye traveled to Athens accompanied by the architect Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll, one of the compatriots he had met in Rome. From there they continued to Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire, a rare adventure in those days. He sketched prodigiously during his travels. Return to Denmark A Sitting Nubian In 1837 he returned home to Copenhagen. His excellent orientalist studies from these exotic locales brought him the Danish public's attention. The Academy, recognizing the excellence of his work during his travels, invited him to apply for membership by submitting a painting. His task was to create a Turkish folk scene. His motif came from a study of a Caravan near Smyrna. It was finished in 1838 and he was unanimously voted into the Academy. His studies from Greece and Turkey continued to serve as the basis for his creative output. In this regard he admired the work of French painter Horace Vernet. That same year at the Spring Exhibition he received the Exhibition Medal, the first time it had been given out, for a painting of a scene outside the Kılıç Ali Pasha Complex, A Turkish notary witnesses a marriage contract. Typical of Rørbye are the rich colours and careful attention to detail. He married Rose Frederikke Schiøtt on 29 August 1839. His health was not good, however, and that same autumn he traveled again to Italy in the hope of renewing his strength. He painted \\"Torvet i Amalfi\\" (\\"The plaza in Amalfi\\") during this stay, and it was exhibited in 1842. He returned home in 1841. He gave private painting lessons to Christen Dalsgaard, and in 1844 became professor at the Academy's school of modelling. His health deteriorated, and he died on 29 August 1848 in Copenhagen, leaving his young wife widowed and with several small children. She exhibited twelve of his paintings, mostly of Italian subjects, in 1849. Works He is remembered for his genre paintings, his landscapes and his architectural paintings, as well as for the many sketches he made during his numerous travels. He painted numerous scenes of life in Copenhagen, as well as large compositions showing Italian and Turkish landscapes and scenes of folk life. He painted few portraits. He was one of the most traveled of the Golden Age painters, and distinguished his artistic production by his interpretations of lands rarely explored at that time for their artistic motifs, as well as for his anecdotal genre paintings depicting the Copenhagen of his day. Discovering Skagen Rørbye visited Skagen on three occasions, painting the local fishermen and the North Sea environs. The first time was in 1833, the year before he set out on his travels to the Mediterranean area and almost half a century before the community of Skagen Painters formed in the town and came to fame. He returned to Skagen towards the end of his life, in the summers of 1847 and 1848. His painting of Men of Skagen on a summer evening in fair weather was one of the last he completed. His works appear in a number of Danish art museums, including the Danish National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst), the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, and the Hirschsprung Collection.

One of the state's most noted authors of nonfiction, Howard's landmark 1943 book, Montana: High, Wide, and Handsome is a respected account of Montana history that has influenced later generations of historians. Howard also authored numerous other historic and literary works, and was a vocal, articulate and persuasive advocate for a variety of social, economic and environmental reforms. These endeavors earned Howard the posthumous sobriquet, \\"Montana's Conscience.\\" Howard believed Montana and the rural West provided the \\"last stand against urban technological tedium\\" for the individual. He fervently believed that small towns of the sort that predominated in Montana provided a democratic bulwark for society. Howard's writings demonstrate his strong belief in the necessity to identify and preserve a region's cultural heritage. Howard worked first as a newspaper editor on the Great Falls Leader, later for the Montana Study (a statewide community development project), and as a freelance writer. His books, speeches and magazine articles, expressed his ideals of community awareness and identity, encouraging readers to retain an idealistic vision contesting the deadening demands of the modern world.Richard B. Roeder, \\"Joseph Kinsey Howard and his Vision of the West,\\" Montana: The Magazine of Western History, March 1980, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp 2–11 Biography Howard was born in Oskaloosa, Iowa, and spent his early childhood years in Lethbridge, Alberta, with his family. In 1919 he moved with his mother to Great Falls, Montana, where he graduated from high school in 1923. Immediately after graduating, Howard landed a job as a reporter for the Great Falls Leader, one of the city's two daily newspapers at the time. He was promoted to news editor at the Leader in 1926, at age 20, a position he held until 1944. At the Leader, Howard developed a characteristic writing style that was simultaneously straightforward, evocative, and compelling, and within a few years his talent began to receive broader attention. Beginning in the mid-1930s Howard authored numerous nonfiction articles for national publications, including The Nation, Harper's Magazine and others. He was also a stringer covering Montana issues for Time and Life magazines. Many of the essays Howard produced for these periodicals explored the difficulties faced by Montana's Native Americans and other disenfranchised groups; others were exposés of what Howard saw as undue corporate influence in Montana economics and life, particularly by the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. Though primarily an author of nonfiction, Howard also wrote book reviews for The New York Times and short stories that were published in The Saturday Evening Post, Esquire, and elsewhere. Howard's first book-length effort was Montana: High, Wide, and Handsome, which was published in 1943. The volume was both a thoughtful history of the state, and an impassioned indictment of the corporate and bureaucratic forces that had heavily influenced much of that history. Among the book's primary targets were Anaconda Copper, which controlled much of the state's economic and political activity at the time, and the Great Northern Railway, which had lured thousands of homesteaders onto Montana land that proved wholly unsuitable for farming. The book also paid particular attention to the inappropriate and inequitable usage of the state's scarce water resources, making an open plea for reform of the system. Montana: High, Wide, and Handsome proved to be an unquestioned landmark in the state's literary history, drawing significant attention both to Howard and the causes he espoused. The themes of corporate exploitation that Howard so convincingly and eloquently outlined became the primary focus of Montana historians for a generation to come, and became a primary theme in the works of K. Ross Toole, the state's most noted academic historian. Howard's book remains perhaps the most influential and evocative work ever published about Montana's past. The recognition afforded Howard by the response to Montana: High, Wide, and Handsome helped open the doors to additional writing, research, and advocacy projects. In 1944 Howard resigned his position at the Leader to become a staff member of the Montana Study, a research project largely funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The Study was an examination of life in small-town Montana, with the goal of identifying ways to improve the quality of life in such places and thus helping ensure their preservation. Howard remained with the Study for two years, before resigning in order to return to writing full- time. Howard's second published volume was Montana Margins: A State Anthology, completed in 1946. The book is a thick collection of short fiction, poetry, and historic narratives, covering the full spectrum of Montana's geography and history. The depth and scope of the book made it a model for later regional anthologies, such as the voluminous 1988 imitation, The Last Best Place: A Montana Anthology. The remainder of Howard's life was devoted to writing, promoting the arts in Montana, and teaching writers workshops. Aided by the support of Guggenheim Fellowships in 1947 and 1948, he devoted considerable effort to the writing of a history of Métis leader Louis Riel and his resistance movements against the Canadian government. The result of this project was the book Strange Empire: A Narrative of the Northwest, published posthumously in 1952. Howard died on August 25, 1951 after suffering a heart attack at age 45. He is still recognized, however, as one of Montana's most talented, influential, and significant authors. His legacy was summed up by Bernard DeVoto in 1952, who wrote, \\"By the time Howard died, he came closer to being the spokesman of the West than any other writer has ever been.\\" Principal Works *Montana: High, Wide and Handsome.

Judeo-Marathi (Marathi: जुदाव मराठी) is a form of Marathi spoken by the Bene Israel, a Jewish ethnic group that developed a unique identity in India. Judæo-Marathi is, like other Marathi, written in the Devanagari script. It may not be sufficiently different from Marathi as to constitute a distinct language, although it is characterized by a number of loanwords from Hebrew and Aramaic as a result of influence from the Cochin Jewish community, Judæo- Malayalam and Portuguese and also some influence from the Urdu language. It has some linguistic features in common with various Jewish languages, developed by Jewish communities in widely disparate places in times, which are also variants of a local language with loanwords from Hebrew and Aramaic. The Judæo-Marathi community mainly resides in Raigad and Thane districts and the city of Mumbai in Maharashtra. The majority of its members have emigrated to Israel, and most of the rest live in England and Canada. Recently, a rare Marathi-Hebrew text titled \\"Poona Haggadah\\", was found in Manchester. The 137-year-old book, which was used by the Bene-Israel community, was discovered by a University of Manchester historian, Yaakov Wise.

The noun or noun phrase that would be the object of a corresponding active sentence (such as \\"Our troops defeated the enemy\\") appears as the subject of a sentence or clause in the passive voice (\\"The enemy was defeated by our troops\\"). The subject of a sentence or clause featuring the passive voice typically denotes the recipient of the action (the patient) rather than the performer (the agent). Verbs in the passive voice in English are formed using several parts (periphrastically): the usual construction uses the auxiliary verbs to be or to get together with the past participle of the main verb. For example, Caesar was stabbed by Brutus is in the passive voice. The subject, Caesar, indicates the person acted upon. The agent is expressed here with the phrase by Brutus, but this can be omitted. The equivalent sentence in the active voice is Brutus stabbed Caesar, in which the subject denotes the doer, or agent, Brutus. A sentence featuring the passive voice is sometimes called a passive sentence, and a verb phrase in passive voice is sometimes called a passive verb. English allows a number of passive constructions which are not possible in many of the other languages with similar passive formation. These include promotion of an indirect object to subject (as in Tom was given a bag) and promotion of the complement of a preposition (as in Sue was operated on, leaving a stranded preposition). Use of the passive in English varies with writing style and field. It is generally much less used than the active voice but is more prevalent in scientific writing than in other prose. Contemporary style guides discourage excessive use of the passive but appropriate use is generally accepted, for instance where the patient is the topic, the agent is unimportant (and therefore omitted), or the agent is to be highlighted (and therefore placed toward the end).  Identifying the English passive  The passive voice is a specific grammatical construction. The essential components, in English, are a form of the auxiliary verb be (or sometimes get) and the past participle of the main verb denoting the action. The agent (the doer of the action) may be specified using a prepositional phrase with the preposition by, but this is optional. It can be used in a number of different grammatical contexts; for instance, in declarative, interrogative, and imperative clauses, and in gerundial constructions: * \\"Kennedy was assassinated in 1963.\\" * \\"Mistakes were made.\\" * \\"The window got broken.\\" * \\"Have you ever been kicked by an elephant?\\" * \\"Don't get killed.\\" * \\"Being attacked by Geoffrey Howe was like being savaged by a dead sheep.\\" =Distinction between passive voice and participial adjective = A distinction is made between the above type of clause and a superficially similar construction where a word with the form of a past participle is used as predicative adjective, and the verb be or similar is simply a copula linking the subject of the sentence to that adjective. For example: ::I am excited (right now). is not passive voice, because excited here is not a verb form (as it would be in the passive the electron was excited with a laser pulse), but an adjective denoting a state. See below. =Misuse of the term= Though the passive can be used for the purpose of concealing the agent, this is not a valid way of identifying the passive, and many other grammatical constructions can be used to accomplish this. Not every expression that serves to take focus away from the performer of an action is an instance of passive voice. For instance \\"There were mistakes.\\" and \\"Mistakes occurred.\\" are both in the active voice. Occasionally, authors express recommendations about use of the passive unclearly or misapply the term \\"passive voice\\" to include sentences of this type. Mark Liberman, \\"'Passive Voice' — 1397-2009 — R.I.P.,\\" in Language Log, 2009 March 12. An example of this incorrect usage can be found in the following extract from an article from The New Yorker about Bernard Madoff (bolding and italics added; bold text indicates the verbs misidentified as passive voice): > Two sentences later, Madoff said, \\"When I began the Ponzi scheme, I believed > it would end shortly, and I would be able to extricate myself, and my > clients, from the scheme.\\" As he read this, he betrayed no sense of how > absurd it was to use the passive voice in regard to his scheme, as if it > were a spell of bad weather that had descended on him . . . In most of the > rest of the statement, one not only heard the aggrieved passive voice, but > felt the hand of a lawyer: \\"To the best of my recollection, my fraud began > in the early nineteen-nineties.\\" Nancy Franklin, \\"The Dolor of Money,\\" The > New Yorker, 2009 March 23, at 24, 25. The intransitive verbs would end and began are in fact in the active voice. Although the speaker may be using words in a manner that diverts responsibility from him, this is not being accomplished by use of passive voice.Mark Liberman, \\"The aggrieved passive voice,\\" in Language Log, 2009 March 16.  Reasons for using the passive voice  The passive voice can be used without referring to the agent of an action; it may therefore be used when the agent is unknown or unimportant, or the speaker does not wish to mention the agent. * Three stores were robbed last night (the identity of the agent may be unknown). * A new cancer drug has been discovered (the identity of the agent may be unimportant in the context). * Mistakes have been made on this project (the speaker may not wish to identify the agent). The last sentence illustrates a frequently criticized use of the passive, as the evasion of responsibility by failure to mention the agent (which may even be the speaker themselves). However the passive voice can also be used together with a mention of the agent, usually using a by-phrase. In this case the reason for use of the passive is often connected with the positioning of this phrase at the end of the clause (unlike in the active voice, where the agent, as subject, normally precedes the verb). Here, in contrast to the examples above, passive constructions may in fact serve to place emphasis on the agent, since it is natural for information being emphasized to come at the end: *Don't you see? The patient was murdered by his own doctor! In more technical terms, such uses can be expected in sentences where the agent is the focus (comment, rheme), while the patient (the undergoer of the action) is the topic or theme (see Topic–comment). There is a tendency for sentences to be formulated so as to place the focus at the end, which can motivate the choice of active or passive voice: * My taxi hit an old lady (the taxi is the topic, and the lady is the focus). * My mother was hit by a taxi (the mother is the topic, and the taxi is the focus). Similarly, the passive may be used because the noun phrase denoting the agent is a long one (containing many modifiers) since it is convenient to place such phrases at the end of a clause: *The breakthrough was achieved by Burlingame and Evans, two researchers in the university's genetic engineering lab.The American Heritage Book of English Usage (1996). In some situations, the passive may be used so that the most dramatic word or the punchline appears at the end of the sentence.  Style advice  Advice against the passive voice = Many language critics and language-usage manuals discourage use of the passive voice. This advice is not usually found in older guides, emerging only in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1916, the British writer Arthur Quiller-Couch criticized this grammatical voice: > Generally, use transitive verbs, that strike their object; and use them in > the active voice, eschewing the stationary passive, with its little > auxiliary its’s and was’s, and its participles getting into the light of > your adjectives, which should be few. For, as a rough law, by his use of the > straight verb and by his economy of adjectives you can tell a man’s style, > if it be masculine or neuter, writing or 'composition'. Arthur Quiller- > Couch, On the Art of Writing ch. 7 (1916). Two years later, in the original 1918 edition of The Elements of Style, Cornell University Professor of English William Strunk, Jr. warned against excessive use of the passive voice: > The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive . . . > This rule does not, of course, mean that the writer should entirely discard > the passive voice, which is frequently convenient and sometimes necessary . > . . The need to make a particular word the subject of the sentence will > often . . . determine which voice is to be used. The habitual use of the > active voice, however, makes for forcible writing. This is true not only in > narrative concerned principally with action, but in writing of any kind. > Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and > emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for some such > perfunctory expression as there is or could be heard. William Strunk, Jr., > The Elements of Style ch. 3, sec. 11 (1918). In 1926, in A Dictionary of Modern English Usage, Henry Watson Fowler recommended against transforming active voice forms into passive voice forms, because doing so \\"...sometimes leads to bad grammar, false idiom, or clumsiness.\\" In 1946, in the essay Politics and the English Language, George Orwell recommended the active voice as an elementary principle of composition: \\"Never use the passive where you can use the active.\\" The Columbia Guide to Standard American English states that: > Active voice makes subjects do something (to something); passive voice > permits subjects to have something done to them (by someone or something). > Some argue that active voice is more muscular, direct, and succinct, passive > voice flabbier, more indirect, and wordier. If you want your words to seem > impersonal, indirect, and noncommittal, passive is the choice, but > otherwise, active voice is almost invariably likely to prove more effective. Use of the passive is more prevalent in scientific writing, but publishers of some scientific publications, such as Nature, Science and the IEEE, explicitly encourage their authors to use active voice. The principal criticism against the passive voice is its potential for evasion of responsibility. This is because a passive clause may be used to omit the agent even where it is important: *We had hoped to report on this problem, but the data were inadvertently deleted from our files. Krista Ratcliffe, a professor at Marquette University, notes the use of passives as an example of the role of grammar as \\"...a link between words and magical conjuring [...]: passive voice mystifies accountability by erasing who or what performs an action [...].\\" = Advice by style guides and grammarians on appropriate use of the passive voice = Jan Freeman, a columnist for The Boston Globe, said that the passive voice does have its uses, and that \\"all good writers use the passive voice.\\" Passive writing is not necessarily slack and indirect. Many famously vigorous passages use the passive voice, as in these examples with the passive verbs italicized: * Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain. (King James Bible, .) * Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this sun of York. (Shakespeare's Richard III, I.1, ll. 1–2.) * We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. (United States Declaration of Independence.) * Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. (Winston Churchill addressing the House of Commons, 20 August 1940.) * Yesterday, December 7, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy - the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. (Franklin D. Roosevelt's Infamy Speech following the Attack on Pearl Harbor.) * For of those to whom much is given, much is required. (John F. Kennedy's quotation of Luke 12:48 in his address to the Massachusetts legislature, 9 January 1961.)Address to Massachusetts legislature (Jan. 9, 1961) While Strunk and White, in The Elements of Style, encourage use of the active voice, they also state that the passive is often useful and sometimes preferable, even necessary, the choice of active or passive depending, for instance, on the topic of the sentence. Another advisor, Joseph M. Williams, who has written several books on style, states with greater clarity that the passive is often the better choice.For instance: According to Williams, the choice between active and passive depends on the answers to three questions: # \\"Must the reader know who is responsible for the action?\\" # \\"Would the active or passive verb help your readers move more smoothly from one sentence to the next? # \\"Would the active or passive give readers a more consistent and appropriate point of view?\\" Bryan A. Garner, in Garner's Modern English Usage, stresses the advantages of the active voice, but gives the following examples of where the passive is preferred: * \\"When the actor is unimportant.\\" * \\"When the actor is unknown.\\" * \\"When you want to hide the actor's identity.\\" * \\"When you need to put the punch word at the end of the sentence.\\" * \\"When the focus of the sentence is on the thing being acted on.\\" * \\"When the passive simply sounds better.\\" Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage recommends the passive voice when identifying the object (receiver) of the action is more important than the subject (agent), and when the agent is unknown, unimportant, or not worth mentioning: *The child was struck by the car. *The store was robbed last night. *Plows should not be kept in the garage. *Kennedy was elected president. The linguist Geoffrey Pullum writes that \\"The passive is not an undesirable feature limited to bad writing, it's a useful construction often needed for clear expression, and every good writer uses it.\\" Despite criticism that the passive can be used to hide responsibility by omitting the agent, the passive can also be used to emphasize the agent. Writers have preferred placing the agent at the end of a clause or sentence to give it greater emphasis, as in the examples given in the previous section: *Don't you see? The patient was murdered by his own doctor! *The breakthrough was achieved by Burlingame and Evans, two researchers in the university's genetic engineering lab. = Actual use of the passive voice = Agentless passives were once common in scientific writing, where the agent may be irrelevant, although at least one publisher considers this a \\"fading practice\\": * The mixture was heated to 300 °C. The passive voice is used more frequently in scientific writing than in other prose, where it is relatively rare. A statistical study of a variety of periodicals found a maximum incidence of 13 percent passive constructions. Despite Orwell's advice to avoid the passive, his Politics and the English Language employs passive voice for about 20 percent of its constructions.  Passive constructions  Canonical passives = In the most commonly considered type of passive clause, a form of the verb be (or sometimes get) is used as an auxiliary together with the past participle of a transitive verb; that verb is missing its direct object, and the patient of the action (that which would be denoted by the direct object of the verb in an active clause) is denoted instead by the subject of the clause. For example, the active clause: * John threw the ball. contains threw as a transitive verb with John as its subject and the ball as its direct object. If we recast the verb in the passive voice (was thrown), then the ball becomes the subject (it is \\"promoted\\" to the subject position) and John disappears: * The ball was thrown. The original subject (the agent) can optionally be re-inserted using the preposition by. * The ball was thrown by John. The above example uses the verb be (in the past tense form was) to make the passive. It is often possible to use the verb get as an alternative (possibly with slightly different meaning); for example, the active sentence \\"The ball hit Bob\\" may be recast in either of the following forms: * Bob was hit by the ball. * Bob got hit by the ball. The auxiliary verb of the passive voice (be or get) may appear in any combination of tense, aspect and mood, and can also appear in non-finite form (infinitive, participle or gerund). See the article on English verb forms for more information. Notice that this includes use of the verb be in progressive aspect, which does not normally occur when be is used as a simple copula. Some examples: *The food is being served. (present progressive passive) *The stadium will have been built by next January. (future perfect passive) *I would have got/gottenIn US English, the general past participle of get is gotten. In British English it is got. injured if I had stayed in my place. (conditional perfect passive with get) *It isn't nice to be insulted. (passive infinitive) *Having been humiliated, he left the stage. (passive present participle, perfect aspect) = Promotion of indirect objects = Unlike some other languages, English also allows passive clauses in which an indirect object, rather than a direct object, is promoted to the subject. For example: * John gave Mary a book. → Mary was given a book (by John). In the active form, gave is the verb; John is its subject, Mary its indirect object, and a book its direct object. In the passive forms, the indirect object has been promoted and the direct object has been left in place. (In this respect, English resembles secundative languages.) It is normally only the first- appearing object that can be promoted; promotion of the indirect object takes place from a construction in which it precedes the direct object (i.e. where there is no to or for before the indirect object), whereas promotion of the direct object in such cases takes place from a construction in which the indirect object follows the direct object (this time being accompanied by to or for; see ). For example: * John gave Mary a book. → Mary was given a book. (and not normally: ??A book was given Mary.) * John gave a book to Mary. → A book was given to Mary. (and not: *Mary was given a book to.) Similar restrictions apply to the prepositional passive, as noted in the following section. = Prepositional passive = It is also possible, in some cases, to promote the object of a preposition. This may be called the prepositional passive, or sometimes the pseudopassive (although the latter term can also have other meanings, such as being equivalent to the impersonal passive voice,Dixon, R. M. W. & Alexandra Aikhenvald (1997). \\"A Typology of Argument- Determined Constructions. pp 72 of Bybee, Joan, John Haiman, & Sandra A. Thompson (eds.)(1997). Essays on Language Function and Language Type: Dedicated to T. Givón. Amsterdam: John Benjamins. particularly in descriptions of other languages). * They talked about the problem. → The problem was talked about. In the passive form here, the preposition is \\"stranded\\"; that is, it is not followed by an object. The prepositional passive is common, especially in informal English. However some potential uses are much less acceptable than others; compare the following examples: * Someone has slept in this bottom bunk. → This bottom bunk has been slept in. (fully acceptable) * Someone has slept above this bottom bunk. → ??This bottom bunk has been slept above. (much less acceptable) The second sentence appears much less acceptable because sleeping above a bunk does not change its state; the verb phrase been slept above does not express a \\"relevantly important property\\" of the bunk. It is not usually possible to promote a prepositional object if the verb also has a direct object; any passive rendering of the sentence must instead promote the direct object. For example: * Someone has put a child in this bunk. → *This bunk has been put a child in. (unacceptable) * Someone has put a child in this bunk. → A child has been put in this bunk. (acceptable) Exceptions occur with certain idiomatic combinations of verb+object+preposition, such as take advantage of: * I feel people have taken advantage of me. → I feel I have been taken advantage of. (acceptable) = Stative and adjectival uses = A type of clause that is similar or identical in form to the passive clauses described above has the past participle used to denote not an action, but a state being the result of an action. For example, the sentence The window was broken may have two different meanings and might be ambiguous: * The window was broken, i.e. Someone or something broke the window. (action, event) * The window was broken, i.e. The window was not intact. (resultant state) The first sentence is an example of the canonical English passive as described above. However the second case is distinct; such sentences are not passive voice, because the participle is being used adjectivally; Such constructs are sometimes called \\"false passives\\" or stative passives (rarely called statal, static, or resultative passives), since they represent a state or result. By contrast the canonical passives, representing an action or event, may then be called dynamic or eventive passives. The ambiguity in such sentences arises because the verb be is used in English both as the passive auxiliary and as the ordinary copular verb for linking to predicate adjectives. When get is used to form the passive, there is no ambiguity: The window got broken cannot have a stative meaning. (For ways in which some other languages make this distinction, see .) If a distinct adjective exists for the purpose of expressing the state, then the past participle is less likely to be used for that purpose; this is the case with the verb open and the adjective open, so the sentence The door was opened (but not the package was unopened) more likely refers to the action than to the state since one can simply say The door was open in the stative case. Past participles of transitive verbs can also be used as adjectives (as in a broken doll), and the participles used in the above-mentioned \\"stative\\" constructions are often considered to be adjectival (in predicative use). Such constructions may then also be called adjectival passives (although they are not normally considered true passives). For example: * She was relieved to find her car. Here, relieved is an ordinary adjective, though it derives from the past participle of relieve.Language Log: How to defend yourself from bad advice about writing In other sentences that same participle may be used to form the true (dynamic) passive: He was relieved of duty. When the verb being put into the passive voice is a stative verb anyway, the distinctions between uses of the past participle become less clear, since the canonical passive already has a stative meaning. (For example: People know his identity → His identity is known.) However it is sometimes possible to impart a dynamic meaning using get as the auxiliary, as in get known with the meaning \\"become known\\". = Passive constructions without an exactly corresponding active = Some passive constructions are not derived exactly from a corresponding active construction in the ways described above. This is particularly the case with sentences containing content clauses (usually that-clauses). Given a sentence in which the role of direct object is played by such a clause, for example *They say (that) he cheats. It is possible to convert this to a passive by promoting the content clause to subject; in this case, however, the clause typically does not change its position in the sentence, and an expletive it takes the normal subject position: *It is said that he cheats. Another way of forming passives in such cases involves promoting the subject of the content clause to the subject of the main clause, and converting the content clause into a non-finite clause with the to-infinitive. This infinitive is marked for grammatical aspect to correspond to the aspect (or past tense) expressed in the content clause. For example: *They say that he cheats. → He is said to cheat. *They think that I am dying. → I am thought to be dying. *They report that she came back / has come back. → She is reported to have come back. *They say that she will resign. → e.g. She is said to be going to resign. Some verbs are used almost exclusively in the passive voice. This is the case with rumor, for example. The following passive sentences are possible: * He was rumored to be a war veteran. / It was rumored that he was a war veteran. but it is not possible to use the active counterpart *They rumored that he was a war veteran. (This was once possible, but has fallen out of use.) Another situation in which the passive uses a different construction than the active involves the verb make, meaning \\"compel\\". When this verb is used in the active voice it takes the bare infinitive (without the particle to), but in the passive voice it takes the to-infinitive. For example: *They made Jane attend classes. *Jane was made to attend classes. = Double passives = The construction called double passive can arise when one verb appears in the to-infinitive as the complement of another verb. If the first verb takes a direct object ahead of the infinitive complement (this applies to raising-to-object verbs, where the expected subject of the second verb is raised to the position of object of the first verb), then the passive voice may be used independently for either or both of the verbs: *We expect you to complete the project. (you is raised from subject of complete to object of expect) *You are expected to complete the project. (passive voice used for expect) *We expect the project to be completed. (passive voice used for complete; now the project is raised to object) *The project is expected to be completed. (double passive) Other verbs which can behave similarly to expect in such constructions include order, tell, persuade, etc., leading to such double passives as The man was ordered to be shot and I was persuaded to be ordained. Similar constructions sometimes occur, however, when the first verb is raising-to-subject rather than raising- to-object – that is, when there is no object before the infinitive complement. For example, with attempt, the active voice construction is simply We attempted to complete the project. A double passive formed from that sentence would be: * The project was attempted to be completed. with both verbs changed simultaneously to the passive voice, even though the first verb takes no object – it is not possible to say *We attempted the project to be completed, which is the sentence from which the double passive would appear to derive. This latter double passive construction is criticized as questionable both grammatically and stylistically. FowlerH.W. Fowler, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage, Second Revised Edition, 1965. Entry for double passives. calls it \\"clumsy and incorrect\\", suggesting that it springs from false analogy with the former (acceptable) type of double passive, though conceding its usefulness in some legal and quasi-legal language. Other verbs mentioned (besides attempt) with which the construction is found include begin, desire, hope, propose, seek and threaten. Similarly, The American Heritage Book of English Usage declares this construction unacceptable.The American Heritage Book of English Usage, ch. 1, sect. 24 \\"double passive.\\" Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1996. https://www.webcitation.org/5QdHYrkv6?url=http://www.bartleby.com/64/C001/024.html Accessed 13 November 2006. It nonetheless occurs in practice in a variety of contexts.Neal Whitman, Double Your Passive, Double Your Fun, in Literal Minded. http://literalminded.wordpress.com/2005/05/16/double-your-passive- double-your-fun/. Accessed 13 November 2006. = Additional passive constructions = Certain other constructions are sometimes classed as passives. The following types are mentioned by Pullum. A bare passive clause is similar to a typical passive clause, but without the passive auxiliary verb (so it is a non-finite clause consisting of a subject together with a verb phrase based on a past participle with the passive construction). These can be used in such contexts as newspaper headlines: *City hall damaged by hail and as modifiers (adverbial phrases), i.e. nominative absolutes: *Our work done, we made our way back home. *That said, there are also other considerations. Other constructions are mentioned in which a passive past participle clause is used, even though it is not introduced by the auxiliary be or get (or is introduced by get with a direct object): * I had my car cleaned by a professional. * Jane had her car stolen last week. * You ought to get that lump looked at. * This software comes pre-installed by the manufacturer. In the concealed passive, the present participle or gerund form (-ing form) appears rather than the past participle. This can appear after need, and for some speakers after want (with similar meaning). For example: * Your car needs washing. (meaning \\"needs to be washed\\") * That rash needs looking at by a specialist. (An idiomatic expression with the same construction is ... doesn't bear thinking about.) The concealed passive (with an -ing form) can also be used in a complex construction; Huddleston gives the following example: * Your hair needs cutting by a professional. [simple construction] * You need your hair cutting by a professional. [complex construction] See also . Middle voice and passival  The term middle voice is sometimes used to refer to verbs used without a passive construction, but in a meaning where the grammatical subject is understood as undergoing the action. The meaning may be reflexive: *Fred shaved, i.e. Fred shaved himself but is not always: *These cakes sell well, i.e. [we] sell these cakes [successfully] *The clothes are soaking, i.e. [the water] is soaking the clothes Such verbs may also be called passival.Oxford English Dictionary, entry for passival. Another construction sometimes referred to as passival involves a wider class of verbs, and was used in English until the nineteenth century. Sentences having this construction feature progressive aspect and resemble the active voice, but with meaning like the passive. Examples of this would be: *The house is building. (modern English: The house is being built) *The meal is eating. (modern English: The meal is being eaten) A rare example of the passival form being used in modern English is with the following phrase: *The drums are beating, i.e. the drums are being beaten This passival construction was displaced during the late 18th and early 19th century by the progressive passive (the form is being built as given above). The grammaticality of the progressive passive, called by some the \\"imperfect passive,\\" was controversial among grammarians in the 19th century, but is accepted without question today. It has been suggested that the passive progressive appeared just to the east of Bristol and was popularized by the Romantic poets.

It was directed and co-written by Samuel Fuller.. The film is a loose remake of The Street with No Name (1948), using the same screenwriter (Harry Kleiner) and cinematographer (Joseph MacDonald) with Robert Ryan playing the role as gang leader that was played by Richard Widmark in the 1948 film. Plot In 1954, a military train guarded by American soldiers and Japanese police is robbed of its cargo of guns, ammunition, and smoke bombs. During the robbery, a US Army Sergeant guarding the train is shot and killed. Five weeks later, a thief named Webber lies dying in a Tokyo hospital, shot by one of his own cohorts during a holdup in which smoke bombs were used. US Army investigaters discover Webber was shot by the same P38 pistol that killed the Sergeant during the train robbery. Webber is questioned by military and police investigators, but he refuses to implicate his fellow gang members. Webber does reveal, however, that he is secretly married to a Japanese woman named Mariko. Police discover among Webber's possessions a letter from an American named Eddie Spanier, who wants to join Webber in Japan after his release from a U.S. prison. Three weeks later, Spanier arrives in Tokyo and makes contact with Mariko, gaining her trust with a photograph of himself taken with Webber. Later, Spanier goes to a pachinko parlor, attempting to sell \\"protection\\" to the manager. But when he tries to shake down another parlor, he is beaten by a group of Americans led by racketeer Sandy Dawson, who is so intrigued with Spanier's audacity that he later arranges for him to join his gang, a disgruntled group of former American servicemen who have been dishonorably discharged. After being accepted into the gang, Spanier secretly meets with U.S. and Japanese investigators, for whom he is actually working undercover. To solidify his cover, Spanier asks Mariko to live with him as his \\"kimono girl.\\" Hoping to discover who killed Webber, Mariko consents to Spanier's offer. In the meantime, Dawson grows to trust Spanier and even saves his life when Eddie is wounded during a robbery. Spanier finally informs Mariko of his real identity as an undercover infiltrator into the Dawson gang. And when Charlie, one of Dawson's men spies Mariko meeting with an American army officer to fill him in on the details of the Dawson gang's next heist, he notifies Dawson. The job is thus aborted, but an outside informant reveals to Dawson that (a) the police are poised to capture him and that (b) Spanier is a military plant. Dawson thus sets up Spanier's death, but that plan backfires. Dawson is chased by the police to a rooftop amusement park. After an intense gunfight, Spanier shoots and kills Dawson.

At the movie's end, an acknowledgments credit thanks \\"the Military Police of the U.S. Army Forces Far East and the Eighth Army, as well as the Government of Japan and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department\\" for their cooperation with the film's production. The film was one of a number of 20th Century Fox movies produced by Buddy Adler being shot on location in Asia around this time. Others included Soldier of Fortune, The Left Hand of God, and Love is a Many Splendored Thing. It was the second CinemaScope Fox film that Samuel Fuller made for the studio. Fuller, Stack, and Yamaguchi arrived in Japan on 26 January 1955. ReceptionCritical response= The staff of Variety magazine wrote of the film, \\"Novelty of scene and a warm, believable performance by Japanese star Shirley Yamaguchi are two of the better values in the production. Had story treatment and direction been on the same level of excellence, House would have been an all round good show. Pictorially, the film is beautiful to see; the talk's mostly in the terse, tough idiom of yesteryear mob pix.\\"Film review Variety, July 1, 1955. Accessed: August 2, 2013. Film critic Keith Uhlich believes the film is an excellent example of wide-screen photography. He wrote in a review, \\"Quite simply, House of Bamboo has some of the most stunning examples of widescreen photography in the history of cinema. Traveling to Japan on 20th Century Fox's dime, Fuller captured a country divided, trapped between past traditions and progressive attitudes while lingering in the devastating aftereffects of an all-too-recent World War. His visual schema represents the societal fractures through a series of deep-focus, Non-theatrical tableaus, a succession of silhouettes, screens, and stylized color photography that melds the heady insanity of a Douglas Sirk melodrama (see, as an especial point of comparison, Sirk's 1956 Korea-set war film Battle Hymn) with the philosophical inquiry of the best noirs.\\"Uhlich, Keith film/DVD review. Slant magazine, 2005. Accessed: August 2, 2013. For many years after its initial release, the film was only seen on TV in pan-and-scan prints, leading people to believe that DeForest Kelley has a small role near the end of the film. When Fox finally struck a new 35mm CinemaScope print for a film festival in the 1990s, viewers were surprised to see that Kelley was in the film all the way through—he was just always off to one side and thus had been panned out of the frame. =References in other films= A scene from House of Bamboo is briefly shown prominently, but enigmatically, in the 2002 film Minority Report.

Background  He was born in Denmark, New York in 1822 to parents Barnabus and Lydia Dickinson. A descendant of the Mayflower Pilgrims, the Dickinson family had been settled in the United States for generations. His family moved to Cornwall, Ontario in 1827. By 1847, he had established a business transporting goods on the Rideau Canal between Ottawa and Kingston. By 1850, Moss owned 16 steamers and 60 barges. Locals started to call him the 'King of the Rideau'.Ellis, Larry. \\"Looking Back\\" Dickinson saw promise on Long Island in the middle of the Rideau River. He purchased seven acres of land in the town he named Manotick. Dickinson chose the name 'Manotick' from the Algonquin word for 'island'.  Career  In 1860, with Joseph Merrill Currier, he completed construction of the Long Island Flouring Mill in Manotick, Ontario. He also built a sawmill, carding mill and bung factory. This served as the economic basis for the formation of the village. The grist mill is today called Watson's Mill and is open to the public as a museum. Moss Kent Dickinson applied to five Order-in-Councils during his life. His son, George Dickinson, applied to two. The Orders-in-Councils were either about a lease of water power or for timber limits. The timber grants were in the North-West Territories. The timber grants provided additional income for the Dickinsons. John A. Macdonald signed Moss Kent Dickinson's and George's Orders-in-Council. It was more of a standard procedure of the Prime Minister than an indicator of a specific benevolence extended towards the family. Wilfrid Laurier had signed George's last Order-in-Council dated March 31, 1903. George had applied for a grant of water bulkheads to Long Island.  Politics  Dickinson served as mayor of Ottawa from 1864 to 1866. Under his leadership, the Ottawa City Passenger Railway was incorporated. It was the first public transit system in Ottawa. The system consisted of horse-drawn tramcars that rode on iron rails. Dickinson was also elected in the riding of Russell in the 1882 federal election. (Dickinson was the last non-Liberal MP for Russell County until Pierre Lemieux was elected in 2006, a span of 124 years.) His son George Lemuel also served in the House of Commons.  Connection to Sir John A. Macdonald  Macdonald visited Manotick once, on February 10, 1887. He gave a speech at the large hall over Dickinson's lumber mill. Macdonald mentioned that he was \\"happy to meet his constituents in Manotick.\\" He had dinner at the Dickinson's residence afterwards. Their conversations were brief, as Macdonald left that night to return to Ottawa. Patronage was a key theme in Dickinson's relationship with Macdonald. This was prominent in their correspondence. It spanned through many years, with the first letter in 1863 and the last in the year of Macdonald's death, 1891. The 28 years of correspondence yielded only 38 letters. Dickinson wrote 31 of them and Macdonald wrote 7. Most of the letters were about appointments or political favours for him or his friends.  Family  Together with his wife Elizabeth, Dickinson had five children: George, Charlotte, William, Lydia and Elizabeth. He also had another son, Alpheus, who died in infancy. Lydia died at age 15 of tuberculosis. None of Dickinson's children ever married, leaving him with no descendants.  Legacy  He died in Manotick in 1897. Dickinson is buried in Beechwood Cemetery beside his wife. Dickinson Days are celebrated in Manotick on the first weekend in June, to coincide with Dickinson's birthday.

Zimmerman graduated from Kellam High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia and played college baseball at the University of Virginia. He is nicknamed Mr. National as he has been a member of the Washington Nationals since his debut on September 1, 2005, and was the team's first ever draft pick when the Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise moved from Montreal. Zimmerman was drafted in the first round as the fourth overall pick by the Nationals in the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft. He is well known for his clutch hitting and walkoff hits. Formerly a third baseman, Zimmerman transitioned to first base in 2015. Amateur career Zimmerman (right) and David Wright were AAU teammates before playing for division rivals for more than a decade. Prior to college, Zimmerman played on the same AAU team as B.J. Upton and David Wright. As a high schooler in 2000, he played on a \\"showcase team\\" with Wright, B.J. Upton, Mark Reynolds and Justin Upton. Zimmerman played high school baseball as a shortstop at Floyd E. Kellam High School in Virginia Beach. Until late in his senior year, James Madison, Charlotte and UNC Wilmington were the only Division I programs to show interest in him. He later received a scholarship offer from Virginia. A three-year starting third baseman for the Virginia Cavaliers in the Atlantic Coast Conference, Zimmerman started in all 174 games he appeared in, and his collegiate career statistics include 250 hits, 140 RBIs, 128 runs, 47 doubles, seven triples and nine home runs. He was successful on 32 of 39 stolen base attempts. His career totals are among the top ten in Virginia statistical categories for doubles (5th), hits (6th) and RBI (7th). Zimmerman established the school record of hits in a season with 90 in 2004, breaking his own record with 92 in 2005. In his final collegiate season, Zimmerman led the Cavaliers with a .393 average, .581 slugging percentage, 136 total bases, 92 hits, 59 RBIs, and 51 runs. He coupled his high batting average with striking out just 14 times in the full season. Through August 2011, he was one of 29 former UVA players to have made it to the major leagues, along with among others former Cavaliers Michael Schwimer, Javier López, and Mark Reynolds. Zimmerman's collegiate awards and honors include 2005 All-American by Baseball America, 2005 All-American by National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association, 2005 All-ACC selection, 2005 ACC All- Tournament Team and 2005 Virginia College Sports Information Directors (VaSID) Player of the Year. He was also a 2004 First Team All-ACC selection, 2004 VaSID All-State Team selection and named to the 2004 Charlottesville NCAA Regional All-Tournament Team. International baseball Zimmerman started at third base for the 2004 USA Baseball National Team that won the gold medal in the FISU II World University Baseball Championship. Zimmerman's summer with Team USA included starting 18 of 24 games and leading the team in batting average (.468), hits (36), RBI (27), runs (25), doubles (12), home runs (4), slugging percentage (.805) and total bases (62). He also posted a .933 fielding percentage and won the team Triple Crown. In his sophomore year in college he batted over .400 in the 9th inning with 2 runners on base. Zimmerman's .468 batting average set a national team single-season record and was a factor in his earning the World University Championship tournament MVP. He won the USA Baseball Richard W. \\"Dick\\" Case Player of the Year Award in 2004. Professional career2005 season= Zimmerman was drafted in the first round as the fourth overall pick by the Washington Nationals in the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft. After being signed on the day he was drafted, he was sent to the Savannah Sand Gnats, the Nationals' minor league A-level affiliate and then quickly moved up to the Harrisburg Senators, the AA affiliate. Zimmerman was called up to the majors when rosters expanded in September 2005, and shared third base duties with Vinny Castilla, taking over the position on a more permanent basis between the time the Nationals were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention and the end of the season. In his first major league at bat at RFK Stadium he muscled a double to right center. Over the course of 20 games, he posted a .397 batting average, 10 doubles, and 6 RBIs in 58 at-bats. He was the only member of the 2005 team to hit over .300 in at least 50 at-bats. =2006 season= He remained with the Major League club to start the 2006 campaign, taking over third base duties from Castilla, who was traded to the San Diego Padres. Prior to 2006 Spring Training, Zimmerman changed his jersey number from #25 (2005) to #11, his former college number. On April 5, 2006, he hit his first Major League home run off a 93-mph fastball in the ninth inning against Mets' closer Billy Wagner. It sailed into the second deck in Shea Stadium, tied the game in the top of the ninth inning, and allowed the Nationals to go on to win their first game of the 2006 season by a score of 9–5 in extra innings. On June 18, 2006, Father's Day, with his father in the stands, Zimmerman hit his tenth Major League home run and his first walk-off home run when he hit a 2-run shot in the bottom of the ninth inning to beat the New York Yankees 3–2. The usually stoic Zimmerman gleefully tossed his batting helmet in the air while rounding third and leaped onto home plate as his teammates crowded around him. He later took a curtain call and tossed his batting gloves into the stands. On July 4, 2006, he hit a 3-run home run against Florida closer Joe Borowski on a two- strike pitch with two outs in the 9th inning of a game Washington was losing 4–3; the walk-off home run carried Washington to a 6–4 victory. This was Zimmerman's 12th career home run and his second walk-off. Two days later he delivered a walk-off single against the Marlins to win the game 8–7 in the 11th inning. On September 27, 2006, against the Philadelphia Phillies, Zimmerman hit his 20th home run of the season and tied the Expos/Nationals franchise record for home runs by a rookie; in 2002, Brad Wilkerson hit 20 home runs for the Montreal Expos. During his first season as the Nationals' third baseman, Zimmerman became a hometown hero and a fan favorite through his defense and ability to come through in late-inning situations. Frank Robinson once compared Zimmerman's defense to that of Brooks Robinson, a former teammate of Frank Robinson's. During the 2006 spring training, Frank Robinson said that he thought 12 homers and 60 RBIs would be a realistic goal for his rookie infielder; Zimmerman exceeded those expectations and finished with 20 home runs and 110 RBIs. Along with those two figures, he finished the 2006 season with 156 games played, 612 at-bats, .288 batting average, .352 OBP, 84 runs scored, 176 hits, 47 doubles, 3 triples, and 11 steals. He led all Major Leaguers with 10 or more bunts in bunt hit percentage, at 83.3% with 10 bunt hits. Although he was named on more ballots (29–27), Zimmerman finished second in the 2006 NL Rookie of the Year voting to Florida Marlins shortstop Hanley Ramírez in the closest Rookie of the Year vote ever. =2007 season= On a game that began on May 12, 2007, but ended at 1:42 am the next day (Mother's Day), Zimmerman hit a two-out bottom-of-the-ninth grand slam to rally the Nationals past the Florida Marlins, 7–3. On June 22, 2007, Zimmerman fielded a routine ground ball that ended up in his jersey. As he bent over to underhand the ball at his stomach level, his jersey top opened and hung down in front of his glove, causing the ball to go into his jersey instead of his positioned glove. On July 4, 2007, Zimmerman hit a two-out go-ahead home run in the first inning against the Chicago Cubs. The one-run home run would have been considered routine had it not continued a trend that led to Zimmerman being declared a \\"human fireworks\\" show by an ESPN.com article. The Independence Day home run marked Zimmerman's fifth game-ending or go-ahead home run on a holiday. Zimmerman hit home runs on Father's Day in 2006 and 2007, Independence Day in 2006 and 2007, and Mother's Day in 2007. Per ESPN.com, Zimmerman was quoted as saying, \\"I wish every day was a holiday.\\" On August 3, 2007, Zimmerman delivered his sixth walk-off game-winner in his first two seasons with a single to left, giving the Nationals a 3–2 win over the visiting St. Louis Cardinals. With another walk-off in September, Zimmerman produced seven walk-offs with three via home run, three via singles, and one via bases-loaded walk, in less than two seasons. Manager Manny Acta stated, \\"He has done some dramatic stuff since he's been up here…he doesn't get rattled when that situation comes up, and I think that's what he has shown here the last two years.\\" Subsequent to the game, Zimmerman was presented the 2006 Larry Doby Legacy Award for his achievements during his rookie season. On August 4, 2007, Zimmerman had his first career multi-homer day, hitting a solo shot in the fourth and a two-run homer in the sixth in a 12–1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. In November 2007 during offseason Zimmerman participated in a homerun derby fundraiser for Grassfield High School in Chesapeake, Virginia. Participants included Michael Cuddyer who won the derby, Justin Upton, B.J. Upton, David Wright, and Mark Reynolds (baseball); all of whom are from the Hampton Roads area. Zimmerman broke his wrist and could not complete the derby and required surgery prior to the 2008 season. =2008 season= thumb On March 30, the Washington Nationals played the Atlanta Braves in the first regular season major league baseball game in the new Nationals Park. In that game, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Zimmerman hit a walk-off home run off of the Braves' Peter Moylan, giving the Nationals a 3–2 win. It was the first home run hit by a Nationals player in the history of their new ballpark. Zimmerman was placed on the disabled list on June 3, 2008 with a small labral tear in his left shoulder. He rejoined the team July 22, 2008, after a short minor league assignment. On February 20, 2009, Zimmerman agreed to a $3.325 million, one-year deal for 2009, avoiding arbitration.Nats, Zimmerman agree to deal, avoid arbitration . Retrieved on February 20, 2009. =2009 season= On April 20, 2009, Zimmerman signed a five-year, $45 million contract with the Nationals through the 2013 season, replacing the one year, $3.325 million contract he had agreed to in February in order to avoid arbitration. He hit safely in 30 consecutive games, the longest such streak by any player since 2006. That streak was broken May 13 against the Giants, going 0-for-3 with two walks in five plate appearances; he hit into a fielder's choice in his last at-bat. His streak of reaching base (via hit or walk) in 43 consecutive games ended on May 26. On July 5, 2009, he was selected to his first All-Star Game. On September 6, 2009, he hit a walk-off two-run homer against the Florida Marlins to give the Nationals a 5–4 win. On November 11, 2009, he won a Gold Glove Award as the best defensive third baseman in the National League, and on November 12, 2009 he won a Silver Slugger Award as the best offensive third baseman in the league. Zimmerman also won a Fielding Bible Award as Major League Baseball's best fielding third baseman. He also won the ESPN WEB Gem Award, which is given to the player with the most Top 10 plays on SportsCenter. He was the first player given the award and as of this year, the only player. =2010 season= Zimmerman (left) and Barack Obama. Zimmerman hit his 100th career home run on May 30, 2010 at Petco Park, he became the second player to reach this milestone in the '05 draft class. He would later homer again to have his 7th multi-homer game of his career. Zimmerman hit 25 home runs, 85 RBIs, and had his first .300 batting average with .307. On November 11, 2010, Zimmerman won his second Silver Slugger Award at third base. =2011 season= Zimmerman started off the season hot batting .357 through April 9. On that day Zimmerman was injured, and on April 11 was placed on the 15-Day DL with an abdominal strain. It wasn't until June 14 that the Nationals star 3rd baseman came back to play against the Cardinals. As of July 9, Zimmerman was hitting .252, with 4 homers and 15 RBIs, with 15 runs scored and 1 stolen base. On August 19, 2011, Zimmerman hit a walk-off grand slam to give the Nationals an 8–4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. =2012 season= On February 26, 2012, Zimmerman signed a 6-year, $100 million extension that runs through 2019 and includes a $24 million club option for 2020. His extension also includes a full no-trade clause, effective 2014. Zimmerman had previously set a deadline of the day before to sign an extension. Zimmerman will earn $12 million in 2012, $84 million from 2013 to 2018 at $14 million annually, $18 million in 2019, and either $18 million if the Nationals pick up his option, or $2 million if they buy him out. After he retires, he will earn $10 million more over the course of 5 years while working for the club. If the Nationals trade him before his no-trade clause takes effect, he will earn an additional $8 million. Zimmerman could make as little as $126 million, or as much as $150 million. On April 27, the Nationals placed Zimmerman on the 15-day Disabled List with shoulder inflammation, retroactive to April 21. He returned May 6. Zimmerman struggled early in the 2012 season due to shoulder pain, hitting only .218 with 3 home runs in his first 55 games. He received a cortisone injection on June 24 to mitigate the pain, with apparent results: in his next 25 games, he hit .392 with 11 home runs and 28 RBI. He brought his OPS up from .590 to .801. For his much- improved performance by mid-July, Zimmerman was awarded the NL Player of the Week. =2013 season= Zimmerman underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder in the off-season to repair the scar tissue that had bothered him in 2012. He spent much of the winter rehabilitating it to get ready for the season, although his doctors estimate he may not regain full strength in it until June. On May 29 Zimmerman had first three home run game as the Nationals lost to the Orioles 9–6. On July 26, 2013, Zimmerman hit his ninth career walkoff home run against the Mets. He completed the season batting .275 with 26 home runs, 79 runs batted in, and 6 stolen bases over a total of 147 games played. =2014 season= After returning from an injury and with Anthony Rendon playing well at third base, Zimmerman played left field for the Nationals. On June 24, three weeks after returning, Zimmerman hit a 2-run home run in the 16th inning against the Milwaukee Brewers. Zimmerman, playing left field, caught the final out to what as at the time the longest game by innings in Nationals history. After the season, the Nationals declined the option of first baseman Adam LaRoche, indicating Zimmerman would permanently move to first base in 2015 due to his many shoulder injuries, with Rendon taking over as starting third baseman. =2015 season= On May 19, 2015, Zimmerman hit his 10th career walk-off home run, ranking him third all time in National League walk-off home runs. On September 4, Zimmerman hit two home runs in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, the second of which was his 200th career home run. =2016 season= On May 15, 2016, Zimmerman hit his first career inside-the-park home run. Outfielders Marcell Ozuna and Giancarlo Stanton violently collided into each other going after the ball that was hit to the right-center field warning track, and both fell to the ground on the outfield warning track. =2017 season= Zimmerman enjoyed a major offensive return to form during the 2017 Washington Nationals season, and he was voted onto the National League All-Star roster as the starting first baseman, his first selection to the All-Star Game since 2009. On April 29, Zimmerman hit a 470-foot homer, marking the longest ever hit at Nationals Park. On July 17, Zimmerman hit his 235th career home run, setting a new Nationals/Expos franchise record. On July 27, Zimmerman hit the fourth consecutive home run by Nationals hitters off Milwaukee Brewers starter Michael Blazek, the first time the feat had been accomplished in Major League Baseball since the 2011 season. On August 9, Zimmerman set the Nationals' franchise record for most runs batted in, earning his 906th RBI on a solo home run against the Miami Marlins. He finished the night by going 4 for 4 with two home runs and 5 RBIs. On August 11, he tied his career high for RBIs in a game, with six, during a contest against the Chicago Cubs in which he also hit two home runs, both coming off of Cubs starter Jon Lester. Zimmerman was awarded the 2017 Players Choice Award Comeback Player of the Year Award. =2018 season= Zimmerman missed nearly half of the 2018 season due to an oblique injury. He batted .264/.337/.486 with 13 home runs in 85 games. On August 22, Zimmerman hit his 11th career walk-off home run against the Philadelphia Phillies off Seranthony Dominguez. His 11 walk offs had him in a three-way tie for 8th most all time. Zimmerman at the White House in 2019, as part of the Nationals visit after winning the 2019 World Series. =2019 season= In 2019 he batted .257/.321/.415 with six home runs and 27 RBIs in 171 at bats. On October 22, 2019, he hit the first World Series home run in Nationals franchise history.https://sports.yahoo.com/zimmerman-full-circle-hr-trot-nats-world- series-041921835--mlb.html The World Series would go on for a full 7 games, and the Nationals won it for the first time in franchise history. =2020 season= The Nationals declined to exercise an $18 million club option for Zimmerman for the 2020 season, making Zimmerman a free agent for the first time in his career. On January 28, 2020, Zimmerman signed a one-year, $2 million contract to return to the Nationals. On June 29, 2020, Zimmerman decided to opt out of playing in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal life Zimmerman's mother, Cheryl, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1995, and has needed to use a wheelchair since 2000. Zimmerman has cited his mother's condition as a substantial formative influence on his development, saying that it forced him to grow up and assume responsibilities at an earlier age than most children. He also founded the ziMS Foundation, which is dedicated to treating and curing multiple sclerosis. Zimmerman became engaged to Heather Downen, a tech-firm sales representative, in April 2012, and they married in January 2013. The couple welcomed their first child, a daughter named Mackenzie, in November 2013. Their second child, a daughter named Hayden, was born in June 2016. Their third child, a son named Henry was born in May 2020. Al Jazeera controversy On January 5, 2016, it was announced that Zimmerman had filed a lawsuit suing Al Jazeera for defamation following the publication's release of the documentary \\"The Dark Side: Secrets of the Sports Dopers\\", which linked Zimmerman and Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard, among others, to a clinic that allegedly distributed steroids and HGH.Yahoo Sports ReferencesFurther reading * Jaffe, Harry. \\"2 Zimms\\", Washingtonian, August 1, 2009.

From 13th to 19th centuries, the term Waldstätte also synoptically referred to the nucleus of the Swiss Confederacy of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden; later, the term was gradually replaced by the term Urschweiz. The term Wald (\\"forest; woods\\") is to be understood in contrast to Forst, the former in Middle High German terminology referring to cultivated land of alternating pastures, fields and woods, while the latter referred to deep, uncultivated forests (silva invia et inculta). So Wiget (2014); but Konrad von Würzburg has the Middle High German term as a common noun referring to a forest wilderness in Der trojanische Krieg v. 5902 (ed. Keller 1858): ez was ein wildiu clûse / und ein vil tiefiu schrunde [...] zuo dirre wüesten waltstete / kam Thetis gerüeret (cited after Grimm, Deutsches Wörterbuch). History The Middle High German terms Waldstette or Stette (in the sense of \\"forested site/settlement\\") is also used alongside Stett (modern Stadt, or \\"town, city\\", in the sense of a powerful, eventually protected settlement with special rights) and Lender (modern Länder, in the sense of rural countrysides) in reference to the individual confederate allies into the first half of 15th century and became gradually replaced by the term Ort (\\"point; lieu\\") or Stand (\\"state\\"), which stayed prominent in German-speaking Switzerland until Helvetic Republic; the term canton (in German: Kanton), in origin a Romance translation of German Ort, was unknown for the German-speaking allies until around 1650. The first recorded use of the term specifically as referring to the wooded valleys of Central Switzerland is in a document dated 1289, mentioning ze Swiz in der waltstat (i.e. \\"in Schwyz, in the wooded site\\"). In 1323, Glarus is named a Waldstatt alongside Schwyz. The application to the allies of the early Swiss Confederacy dates to 1309. In 1310, Duke Frederick the Fair complains about the king impeding his rights to the civitatibus Silvanis. With the establishment of the Confederacy in the 1310s, the term is adopted as an exonym, and in the pacts which expanded the Confederacy, with Lucerne in 1332 and with Berne in 1353. The inclusion of Lucerne as a \\"fourth\\" Waldstätte is first mentioned in an addition dated to the 1450s in the Silver Book of Egloff Etterlin. In the protocols of the Swiss Diet in the second half of the 15th century, under the presidency of Lucerne, the term vier waltstette sees frequent use. Albrecht von Bonstetten in his Superioris Germaniae Confoederationis descriptio (1479) suggests that the term vier Waldstett (latinized quatuor Loca Silvarum) was in common use. Lake Lucerne is given the new name of Vierwaldstättersee (aka Lake of Four Forested Sites) in the 16th century.

Sieve elements are the major conducting cells in phloem. Conducting cells aid in transport of molecules especially for long- distance signaling. In plant anatomy, there are two main types of sieve elements. Companion cells and sieve cells originate from meristems, which are tissues that actively divide throughout a plant's lifetime. They are similar to the development of xylem, a water conducting tissue in plants whose main function is also transportation in the plant vascular system. Sieve elements' major function includes transporting sugars over long distance through plants by acting as a channel. Sieve elements elongate cells containing sieve areas on their walls. Pores on sieve areas allow for cytoplasmic connections to neighboring cells, which allows for the movement of photosynthetic material and other organic molecules necessary for tissue function. Structurally, they are elongated and parallel to the organ or tissue that they are located in. Sieve elements typically lack a nucleus and contain none to a very small number of ribosomes. The two types of sieve elements, sieve tube members and sieve cells, have different structures. Sieve tube members are shorter and wider with greater area for nutrient transport while sieve cells tend to be longer and narrower with smaller area for nutrient transport. Although the function of both of these kinds of sieve elements is the same, sieve cells are found in gymnosperms, non-flowering vascular plants, while sieve tube members are found in angiosperms, flowering vascular plants. Companion cell (left, light pink), nucleus (dark pink), sieve tube (right, solid green), sieve tube plates (dashed green), dissolved nutrients (yellow)  Discovery  Sieve elements were first discovered by the forest botanist Theodor Hartig in 1837. Since this discovery, the structure and physiology of phloem tissue has been emphasized more as there has been greater focus on its specialized components such as the sieve cells. Phloem was introduced by Carl Nägeli in 1858 after the discovery of sieve elements. Since then, multiple studies have been conducted on how sieve elements function in phloem in terms of working as a transport mechanism. An example of analysis of phloem through sieve elements was conducted in the study of Arabidopsis leaves. By studying the phloem of the leaves in vivo through laser microscopy and the usage of fluorescent markers (placed in both companion cells and sieve elements), the network of companion cells with the compact sieve tubes was highlighted. The markers for sieve elements and companion cells was used to study the network and organization of phloem cells.  Sieve tube members  There are two categories of sieve elements: sieve cells and sieve tube members. The main functions of sieve tube members include maintaining cells and transporting necessary molecules with the help of companion cells. The sieve tube members are living cells (which do not contain a nucleus) that are responsible for transporting carbohydrates throughout the plant. Sieve tube members are associated with companion cells, which are cells that combine with sieve tubes to create the sieve element-companion cell complex. This allows for supply and maintenance of the plant cells and for signaling between distant organs within the plant. Sieve tubes members do not have ribosomes or a nucleus and thus need companion cells to help them function as transport molecules. Companion cells provide Sieve tube members with proteins necessary for signaling and ATP in order to help them transfer molecules between different parts of the plant. It is the companion cells that helps transport carbohydrates from outside the cells into the sieve tube elements. The companion cells also allow for bidirectional flow. While sieve tube members are responsible for a lot of the signaling necessary for the plant's organs, only some proteins are active within the sieve tubes. This is due to the fact that sieve tube members do not have ribosomes to synthesize protein as this makes it harder to determine which active proteins are specifically related to the sieve tube elements. Sieve tube members form a sieve tube which have sieve plates between them to transport nutrients. The companion cells shown contain a nucleus which can synthesize additional protein for cell signaling. The bidirectional flow of nutrients is shown with the double arrow. Sieve tube members and companion cells are connected through plasmodesmata. Plasmodesmata consists of channels between cell walls of adjacent plant cells for transport and cell to cell recognition. Structurally, the walls of sieve tubes tend to be dispersed with plasmodesmata grouped together and it is these areas of the tube walls and plasmodesmata that develop into sieve plates over time. Sieve tube members tend to be found largely in angiosperms. They are very long and have horizontal end walls containing sieve plates. Sieve plates contain sieve pores which can regulate the size of the openings in the plates with changes in the surroundings of the plants. These sieve plates are very large which means that there is a greater surface area for material transport. Sieve tube members are arranged from end to end in a longitudinal manner in order to form sieve tubes. Formed through these vertical connections between multiple sieve tube members, sieve tubes are directly responsible for the transport through the minimum resistance surrounding their walls. By having the assistance of these pores that constitute a majority of the structure of sieve plates, the diameter of the sieve tubes can be regulated. This regulation is necessary for the sieve tubes to respond to changes in the environment and conditions within the organism.  Sieve cells  Sieve cells are long, conducting cells in the phloem that do not form sieve tubes. The major difference between sieve cells and sieve tube members is the lack of sieve plates in sieve cells. They have a very narrow diameter and tend to be longer in length than sieve tube elements as they are generally associated with albuminous cells. Similar to how Sieve Tube members are associated with companion cells, sieve cells are flanked with albuminous cells in order to aid in transporting organic material. Albuminous cells have long, unspecialized areas with ends that overlap with those of other sieve cells and contain nutrients and store food in order to nourish tissues. They enable the sieve cells to be connected to parenchyma, functional tissue in the organs, which helps to stabilize the tissue and transport nutrients. Sieve cells are also associated with gymnosperms because they lack the companion cell and sieve member complexes that angiosperms have. Sieve cells are very uniform and have an even distribution across of sieve areas. Their narrow pores are necessary in their function in most seedless vascular plants and gymnosperms which lack sieve-tube members and only have sieve cells to transport molecules. While sieve cells have smaller sieve areas, they are still distributed across several cells to still effectively transport material to various tissue within the plant. Sieve cell associated albuminous cells work between phloem and parenchyma. They connect parenchyma with mature sieve cells to help participate in transport of cells. There can be many of these albuminous cells that belong to one sieve cell, depending on the function of the tissue or organ. Sieve pores are very common in the areas that have overlapping sieve cells. Callose levels are measure in order to observe the activity of sieve cells. Callose acts as a block to the sieve pores that are present in both of these sieve elements. A lack callose suggests that the sieve elements are more active and therefore can regulate their pores more actively in response to environmental changes.  Further applications in agriculture  Because the plant vascular system is vital in growth and development of plant cells and the organs within the plant, the role of sieve elements in the transport of necessary carbohydrates and macromolecules is largely expanded. This can be applied to agriculture to observe the way resources are distributed to various parts of the plant. Plasmodesmata connect companion cells to sieve elements and parenchyma cells can connect the sieve tubes to various tissues within the plant. This system between the plasmodesmata, companion cells, and sieve tubes allow for the delivery of necessary metabolites. The yield of agricultural product could potentially be increased to maximize the delivery system of these specialized cells within the phloem in a way that diffusion can be maximized. It has been discovered that the angiosperm phloem can use the sieve tubes as a way to transport various forms of RNA to sink tissues which can help alter transcriptional activity. Sink tissues are tissues that are in the process of growth and need nutrients. Having Sieve elements transport additional nutrients to sink tissues can speed up the growth process, which can affect plant growth and development. Over time, rapid growth has the potential of leading to greater agricultural output.

This disease causes illness in piglets, with clinical signs including progressive loss of body condition, visibly enlarged lymph nodes, difficulty in breathing, and sometimes diarrhea, pale skin, and jaundice. PCVD is very damaging to the pig-producing industry and has been reported worldwide. PCVD is caused by Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2). The North American industry endorses \\"PCVAD\\" and European use \\"PCVD\\" to describe this disease. PMWS and PCV-2 Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is the classic PCVD entity, caused by PCV-2. PCV-2 has a near universal distribution – present in most pig herds. In contrast, PMWS is more sporadic in its distribution. Experimental induction of PMWS has not been achieved by PCV-2 infection alone, using infectious DNA clones of the virus or a pure form of PCV-2 derived from infectious DNA clones. Therefore, it is assumed that PMWS is a multifactorial disease. PCV-2 is necessary but not sufficient for the development of PMWS. However, viral infection by itself tends to cause only mild disease, and co-factors such as other infections or immunostimulation seem necessary for development of severe disease.[1] For example, concurrent infection with porcine parvovirus or PRRS virus, or immunostimulation lead to increased replication of PCV-2 and more severe disease in PCV-2-infected pigs. There is no significant correlation of the disease with virus sequence variation with affected and control pigs. Porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) was first identified in 1974 and was recognized as a non-disease-causing agent that frequently occurred in laboratory tissue cultures.  Clinical signs  Both PMWS and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) are associated to PCV-2.Barcellos & Pescador, 2003 and Segalés & Domingo, 2000 Many pigs affected by the circovirus also seem to develop secondary bacterial infections, like Glässer disease (Haemophilus parasuis), pulmonary pasteurellosis, colibacilosis, salmonellosis and others.David Barcellos, 2006 Postmortem lesions occur in multiple organs, especially in lymphoid tissues and lung, giving rise to the term \\"multisystemic\\".Harding & Clark, 1997 Lesions may also affect the skin, kidney, reproductive tissue, brain, or blood vessels. Wasting pigs is the most common sign of PMWS infection, increasing the mortality rate significantly.  Management practices to decrease severity of PMWS  François Madec, a French author, has written many recommendations on how reduce PMWS symptoms. They are mostly measures for disinfection, management, and hygiene, referred to as the \\"20 Madec Points\\" [Madec & Waddilove, 2002]. These measures have recently been expanded upon by Dr. David Barcellos, a professor at the Veterinary College in the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. He presented these points at \\"1st Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul Symposium about swine management, reproduction, and hygiene\\". He divided his points by pig growth stage, and they can be loosely summarized as: *keep the gutters clean *increase feeder space *use pens or small cages with solid dividers *avoid mixing pigs from different origins *improve the quality of air *decrease maximum capacity, giving each pig more room *separate sick animals as soon as possible, and treat them in a hospital pen. If they do not respond to antibiotics in three days, they should be culled *control access of people and other animals *reduce environmental stress factors such as gases and air currents *use immunizations and preventive medications for secondary agents commonly associated with PMWS See also * Animal viruses * Dermatitis * Nephropathy ReferencesFurther reading *Grierson S.S., King D.P., Wellenberg G.J. & Banks M.; \\"Genome sequence analysis of 10 Dutch porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) isolates from a PMWS case-control study.\\" Res Vet Sci. 2004 Dec; 77(3):265-8).

It specializes in leather, lifestyle accessories, home furnishings, perfumery, jewellery, watches and ready-to-wear. Its logo, since the 1950s, is of a Duc carriage with horse. Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski is the current creative director.Steff Yotka, Anticipating Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski’s Debut at Hermès style.com March 9, 2015Nadya Masidlover, Hermès Designer Steps Out of the Shadows Wall Street Journal March 9, 2015 HistoryBeginnings in the 19th century= Thierry Hermès, founder of Hermès. Thierry Hermès was born in Krefeld, Germany, to a French father and a German mother. The family moved to France in 1828. In 1837, Hermès first established a harness workshop in the Grands Boulevards quarter of Paris, dedicated to serving European noblemen. He created high- quality wrought harnesses and bridles for the carriage trade, winning several awards including the first prize in its class in 1855 and again in 1867 at the Expositions Universelles in Paris. Hermès's son, Charles-Émile, took over management from his father in 1880 and moved the shop to 24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, where it remains. With the help of his sons Adolphe and Émile- Maurice, Charles-Émile introduced saddlery and started selling his products retail. The company catered to the élite of Europe, North Africa, Russia, Asia, and the Americas. In 1900, the firm offered the Haut à Courroies bag, specially designed for riders to carry their saddles with them. =Hermès Frères era= After Charles-Émile Hermès's retirement, sons Adolphe and Émile- Maurice took leadership and renamed the company Hermès Frères. Shortly after, Émile-Maurice began furnishing the czar of Russia with saddles. By 1914, up to 80 saddle craftsmen were employed. Subsequently, Émile-Maurice was granted the exclusive rights to use the zipper for leather goods and clothing, becoming the first to introduce the device in France. In 1918, Hermès introduced the first leather golf jacket with a zipper, made for Edward, Prince of Wales. Because of its exclusive rights arrangement the zipper became known in France as the fermeture Hermès (Hermès fastener). Throughout the 1920s when he was the sole head of the firm, Émile-Maurice added accessories and clothing collections. He also groomed his three sons-in-law (Robert Dumas, Jean-René Guerrand, and Francis Puech) as business partners. In 1922, the first leather handbags were introduced after Émile-Maurice's wife complained of not being able to find one to her liking. Émile-Maurice created the handbag collection himself. Hermès Frères advertisement, 1923 In 1924, Hermès established a presence in the United States and opened two shops outside of Paris. In 1929, the first women's couture apparel collection was previewed in Paris. During the 1930s, Hermès introduced some of its most recognized original goods such as the leather \\"Sac à dépêches\\" in 1935 (later renamed the \\"Kelly bag\\" after Grace Kelly) and the Hermès carrés (square scarves) in 1937. The scarves became integrated into French culture. In 1938, the \\"Chaîne d'ancre\\" bracelet and the riding jacket and outfit joined the classic collection. By this point, the company's designers began to draw inspirations from paintings, books, and objets d'art. The 1930s also witnessed Hermès's entry into the United States market by offering products in a Neiman Marcus department store in New York; however, it later withdrew. In 1949, the same year as the launch of the Hermès silk tie, the first perfume, \\"Eau d'Hermès\\", was produced. From the mid-1930s, Hermès employed Swiss watchmaker Universal Genève as the brand's first and exclusive designer of timepieces, producing a line of men's wrist chronographs (manufactured in 18K gold or stainless steel) and women's Art Déco cuff watches in 18K gold, steel, or platinum. Both models contained dials signed either \\"Hermès\\" or \\"Hermès Universal Genève\\", while the watch movements were signed \\"Universal Genève S.A.\\". The Hermès/Universal partnership lasted until the 1950s. Émile-Maurice summarized the Hermès philosophy during his leadership as \\"leather, sport, and a tradition of refined elegance.\\" =Post- Émile-Maurice Hermès= Robert Dumas-Hermès (1898–1978), who succeeded Émile- Maurice after his death in 1951, closely collaborated with brother-in-law Jean-René Guerrand. Dumas became the first man not directly descended from Hermès père to lead the company because his connection to the family was only through marriage. Thus, he incorporated the Hermès name into his own, Dumas- Hermès. The company also acquired its Duc-carriage-with-horse logo and signature orange paper boxes in the early 1950s. Dumas introduced original handbags, jewelry, and accessories and was particularly interested in design possibilities with the silk scarves. Ironically, during the mid-20th century, scarf production diminished. World Tempus, a Web portal dedicated to watchmaking, states: \\"Brought to life by the magic wand of Annie Beaumel, the windows of the store on the [rue du] Faubourg Saint-Honoré became a theatre of enchantment and [established the store as] a Parisian meeting-place for international celebrities.\\" In 1956, Life magazine featured a photograph of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of Monaco, carrying the \\"Sac à dépêches\\" bag. Purportedly, she held it in front of herself to disguise her pregnancy. Thus, when the public began calling it the \\"Kelly\\" bag, a name subsequently adopted by Hermès, it became hugely popular. The perfume business became a subsidiary in 1961, concurrently with the introduction of the \\"Calèche\\" scent, named after a hooded four-wheeled horse carriage, known since the 18th century, and is also the company's logo since the 1950s. (In 2004, Jean-Claude Ellena became the in-house perfumer or \\"nose\\" and has created several successful scents, including the Hermessence line of fragrances.) =Decline and revamp= Hermes Store at Avenue George V in Paris 8th arrondissement, France. Despite the company's apparent success in the 1970s, exemplified by multiple shops' being established worldwide, Hermès began to decline, compared to competitors. Some industry observers have assigned the cause to Hermès's insistence on the exclusive use of natural materials for its products, unlike other companies that were calling on new man-made materials. During a two-week lapse in orders, the Hermès workrooms were silent. The renewed success of Hermès's fragrances in the marketplace was probably due to the public's increasingly paradigmatic shift of back to natural materials as opposed to artificial. This point undoubtedly contributed to reestablishing Hermès's scents as a major player in the fragrances marketplace. Jean-Louis Dumas, the son of Robert Dumas-Hermès, became chairman in 1978 and had the firm concentrate on silk and leather goods and ready-to-wear, adding new product groups to those made with its traditional techniques. Unlike his father, Jean-Louis was maternally related to the Hermès family. Travelling extensively and marrying Rena Gregoriadès, he entered the buyer-training program at Bloomingdale's, the New York department store. Having joined the family firm in 1964, he was instrumental in turning around its decline. Dumas brought in designers Eric Bergère and Bernard Sanz to revamp the apparel collection and, in collaboration, added unusual entries. They included the python motorcycle jackets and ostrich-skin jeans, which were dubbed as \\"a snazzier version of what Hermès has been all along.\\" (Annual sales in 1978, when Jean-Louis became head of the firm, were reported at US$50 million. By 1990, annual sales were reported at US$460 million, mainly due to Dumas's strategy.) In 1979, he launched an advertising campaign featuring a young, denim-clad woman wearing an Hermès scarf. The purpose was to introduce the Hermès brand to a new set of consumers. As one fashion-sector observer noted: \\"Much of what bears the still-discreet Hermès label changed from the object of an old person's nostalgia to the subject of young peoples' dreams.\\" However, Dumas's change-of-image created outrage both within and outside of the firm. Also in the 1970s, the watch subsidiary, La Montre Hermès, was established in Bienne, Switzerland. Then, throughout the 1980s, Dumas strengthened the company's hold on its suppliers, resulting in Hermès's gaining great stakes in prominent French glassware, silverware acquiring venerable tableware manufacturers such as Puiforcat, St. Louis, and Périgord. =Growth= Hermes boutique at The Lee Garden One, Hong Kong From the 1980s, tableware became a strong segment of the firm. And, overall, the collection of Hermès goods expanded in 1990 to include over 30,000 pieces. New materials used in the collection included porcelain and crystal. Hermès relocated its workshops and design studios to Pantin, just outside Paris. By June 1993 Hermès had gone public on the Paris Bourse (stock exchange). At the time, the equity sale generated great excitement. The 425,000 shares floated at FFr 300 (US$55 at the time) were oversubscribed by 34 times. Dumas told Forbes magazine that the equity sale would help lessen family tensions by allowing some members to liquidate their holdings without \\"squabbling over share valuations among themselves.\\" To this time, the Hermès family was still retaining a strong hold of about 80% in stocks, placing Jean-Louis Dumas and the entire family on the Forbes list of billionaires. Mimi Tompkins of U.S. News & World Report called the company \\"one of Paris' best guarded jewels.\\" In the following years, Dumas decreased Hermès franchises from 250 to 200 and increased company-owned stores from 60 to 100 to better control sales of its products. The plan was to cost about FFr 200 million in the short term but to increase profits in the long term. Having around FFr 500 million to invest, Hermès pressed ahead, targeting China for company-operated boutiques, finally opening a store in Beijing in 1996. In 1997, Jean-Louis hired iconoclastic Belgian designer Martin Margiela to supervise women's ready-to-wear. By the late 1990s, Hermès continued extensively to diminish the number of franchised stores, buying them up and opening more company-operated boutiques. The fashion industry was caught off guard in September 1999, when Jean-Louis decided to pay FFr 150 million for a 35% stake in the Jean-Paul Gaultier fashion house. In the latter part of the 1900s, the company encouraged its clientele to faites nous rêver (make us dream), producing throughout the period artistically atypical orders. =The 2000s to today= Hermès, Madrid, Spain (2016) In 2003, Margiela left Hermès, and highly controversial Jean-Paul Gaultier, as the head designer, debuted his first ready-to-wear collection for fall/winter 2004–05. After 28 years as head of the firm, Jean-Louis Dumas retired in January 2006. Known for his charm and one of Europe's greatest authorities on luxury, he died in 2010 after a long illness. Patrick Thomas, who had joined the company in 1989 and who had worked with Jean-Louis as the co-CEO from 2005, replaced him. Thomas became the first non-Hermès family member to head the company. In February 2015, Hermès has announced an increase of its turnover of 9.7%, which represents more than €4 billion in sales. This increase is internationally visible. In Asia, excluding Japan, where the turnover grew 7%, in America, with 10% rise, in Europe where it grew 7% growth and generated a good performance in the group's stores. In March 2018, Hermès opened its largest, multi-storey shop, in middle east, at The Dubai Mall. On 17 May 2018, Malaysian police seized 284 luxury bags, believed to be some Hermès handbags from the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato' Seri Najib Razak's-linked apartments. In 2019, the brand was ranked 33rd in the Forbes List \\"World's Most Valuable Brands\\". Designers The designers throughout the company's history have included Lola Prusac, Jacques Delahaye, Catherine de Karolyi, Monsieur Levaillant, Nicole de Vesian, Eric Bergère, Claude Brouet, Tan Giudicelli, Marc Audibet, Mariot Chane, Bernard Sanz, Martin Margiela, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Christophe Lemaire, Véronique Nichanian (the men's-wear designer since 1988), and Nadège Vanhee- Cybulski (since 2014 succeeding Lemaire). Goods and products An Hermès soap bar bearing the logo. Known for luxury goods, by 2008, Hermès had 14 product divisions that encompassed leather, scarves, ties, men's and women's wear, perfume, watches, stationery, footwear, gloves, enamelware, decorative arts, tableware, and jewellery. Hermès sales compose about 30% leather goods, 15% clothes, 12% scarves, and 43% other wares. The company licenses no products and keeps tight control over the design and manufacture of its vast inventory. The firm is very attached to its traditional business model and rejects mass production, assembly lines, and mechanization. Hermès's goods are almost entirely made in France by hand in middle-sized workshops known as Les Ateliers Hermès that emphase high-quality manufacturing. Indeed, Hermès claims most items are fabricated from beginning to end by only one person, which is supposed to guarantee the quality and uniqueness of its products. In 2012, Hermès retail outlets changed their policy regarding returns and exchanges of products. Consumers may only exchange items within ten days of purchase and only for another color variant of the original purchase. No other post- purchase exchanges are permitted, and refunds are never offered, regardless of the consumer's having a receipt. =Scarves= The scarf or carré (square) was introduced in 1937. The first example was a 70 cm x 70 cm print of white- wigged females playing a popular period game, a custom-made accessory named \\"Jeu des Omnibus et Dames Blanches.\\" Hermès oversaw the production of its scarves throughout the entire process, purchasing raw Chinese silk, spinning it into yarn, and weaving it into fabric twice as strong and heavy as most scarves available at the time. The company's scarf designers spend years creating new print patterns that are individually screen-printed. Designers can choose from over 70,000 different colors. When production first began, a dedicated factory was established in Lyon, France, the same year that Hermès celebrated its 100th anniversary. Contemporary Hermès carrés measure 90 cm × 90 cm, weigh 65 grams and are woven from the silk of 250 mulberry moth cocoons. All hems are hand-stitched. Motifs are wide-ranging, Two silk-scarf collections per year are released, along with some reprints of older designs and limited editions. And two collections per year are introduced in a Cashmere/silk blend. Since 1937, Hermès has produced over 2,000 unique designs; the horse motif is particularly famous and popular. The ubiquitous \\"Brides de Gala\\" version, introduced in 1957, has been produced more than 70,000 times. An Hermès scarf is sold somewhere in the world every 25 seconds; by the late 1970s, more than 1.1 million scarves had been sold worldwide. The scarves have been worn by an array of celebrities, partially such as: * Queen Elizabeth II in a large number of paparazzi photographs also with sister Princess Margaret, in the middle of one of three portraits on a 1986 British postage stamp, and by Helen Mirren playing the monarch in the film The Queen, 2006. * Princess Grace Kelly in a photograph on the cover of a 1956 issue of Life magazine and, in the same year, tied by her as a sling for a broken arm. * Jackie Kennedy Onassis over her head and tied around her neck. * actress Audrey Hepburn in a photograph on the cover of a 1956 issue of Life\\" magazine and in the film Charade, 1963. * actress Sharon Stone in a bondage scene in the film Basic Instinct, 1992. * actress Cameron Diaz in the film My Best Friend's Wedding, 1997. * actress Anne Hathaway in the film The Princess Diaries, 2001. * deputy artistic director of Hermès women's wear, Bali Barret, as a cape, 2011. * entertainer Madonna wearing \\"La Vie au Cheval\\" design as a halter top, 2002. =Neckties= ties. In 1946, the brand introduced a range of men's silk neckties in an array of motifs and widths. Neckties account for 10% of the company's annual sales. =Partnership with the Tuareg= For years, Hermès has partnered with Tuareg tribesmen for silver jewelry. The Saharan nomads' traditional motifs are often mirrored in various Hermès products, including scarves. Leather Goods The Kelly bag Exotic leathers of the bags make them highly valuable and noticeable, e.g., ostrich leather A Hermès Birkin bag Hermès is known for its handmade luggage and handbags. One of them might require 18 to 24 hours to produce. The construction of each Kelly bag, for example, requires 18 hours to fully realize. Hermès's leathers come from all over the world. Customers may currently wait from six months to one year for delivery of one of the house's signature bags. Incidentally, should Hermès's leather goods require repair, owners can bring an item to any Hermès store, where it will be shipped to Les Ateliers Hermès in Pantin for repair or reconditioning. Another famous Hermès handbag, the \\"Birkin\\", was named after English actress Jane Birkin. In a chance encounter with Jean-Louis Dumas, she complained that her bag was not practical for everyday use. Consequently, he invited her to France where they co-designed the bag in 1984. Birkin has since stopped carrying her namesake bag due to her tendonitis, as the bag became too large and heavy for her to carry.https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/the-birkin-rules Asked by her that her name be removed and with much back-and-forth comments about various issues such as having her name removed. According to Vogue: \\"Jane Birkin 'is satisfied by the measures taken by Hermès', according to the brand, following an investigation by the fashion house [that refuted] claims made by PETA [the animal-rights organization] that its famous Birkin bags were being 'constructed from the skins of factory-farmed and cruelly slaughtered crocodiles.' \\"Scarlet Conlon, \\"Birkin 'Satisfied\\" by Hermès Investigation,\\" Vogue, 15 September 2015 Perfumery Since 1951, the company has created a number of scents for both men and women, as well as unisex lines.Hermès International, 2016 Registration Document =Feminine fragrances= * Calèche, 1961 * Amazone, 1974 (updated 2017) * Parfum d'Hermès, 1984 * 24 Faubourg, 1995 * Hiris, 1999 * Rouge Hermès, 2000 * Eau des Merveilles, 2004 * Kelly Calèche, 2007 * Jour d'Hermès, 2013 * Jour d'Hermès Gardenia, 2015 * Galop d'Hermès, 2016 * Twilly, d'Hermes 2017 * Twilly d, Hermes Poivre 2019 =Masculine fragrances= * Bel Ami, 1986 * Équipage, 1970 * Rocabar, 1998 * Concentré d'Orange Verte, 2004 * Terre d'Hermès, 2006 * Bel Ami Vetiver, 2013 * Equipage Geranium, 2015 =The Garden Collection= ** Un Jardin en Méditerranée, 2003 ** Un Jardin sur le Nil, 2005 ** Un Jardin après la Mousson, 2008 ** Un Jardin sur le Toit, 2011 ** Le Jardin de Monsieur Li, 2015 ** Un Jardin De La Lagune, 2019 =Colognes= * Eau de Cologne d'Hermès, 1978 (re-released as Eau d'Orange Verte, 1997) * Eau de Gentiane Blanche, 2009 * Eau de Pamplemousee Rose, 2009 * Eau de Narcisse Bleu, 2013 * Eau de Mandarine Ambrée, 2013 * Eau de Rhubarbe Éclarte, 2016 * Eau de Neroli Dore, 2016 * Eau de Citron noir, 2018 =Unisex= * Eau de Hermes, 1951 * Voyage de Hermes, 2016 (eau de toilette and parfum) =Hermessence scents exclusive to Hermès boutiques= * Rose Ikebana, 2004 * Vétiver Tonka, 2004 * Poivre Samarcande, 2004 * Ambre Narguilé, 2004 * Osmanthe Yunnan, 2005 * Paprika Brazil, 2006 * Brin de Réglisse, 2007 * Vanille Galante, 2009 * Iris Ukiyoé, 2010 * Santal Massoïa, 2011 * Épice Marine, 2013 * Cuir d'Ange, 2014 * Muguet Porcelaine, 2016 * Agar Ébene, 2018 * Cèdre Sambac, 2018 * Myrrhe Églantine, 2018 * Essences: Musc Pallida and Cardamusc, 2018 Crystal lighting and glass Belonging to the group is the crystal glass manufacturer Saint-Louis, the oldest crystal company in the world. Since its founding in 1586, Saint-Louis has drawn design inspiration from the decorative periods of the 19th and 20th centuries, from the Restoration to Modern styles, through Napoléon III, Art Nouveau and Art Déco. Saint-Louis became one of the Hermès Group Métiers in 1989. Apple Watch Hermès In 2015, Hermès partnered with Apple Inc. to produce the Apple Watch Hermès, combining Apple's smartwatch with Hermès's specially crafted single tour, double tour, and cuff watch bands. The Hermès Foundation The Hermès Foundation was launched in 2008. It is chaired by Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the artistic director of Hermés, and directed by Catherine Tsekenis. The Foundation embodies the group's goal to sponsor and support creation and craftsmanship activities. In 2010, it launched the biannual Emile Hermès Prize that rewards an innovative project in the field of design. In 2014, the three winners who shared the first prize, chaired by Italian architect Michele De Lucchi, were Johan Brunel and Samuel Misslen for their \\"Ventilated Capsule,\\" Antoine Lesur and Marc Venot for \\"Hut,\\" and Paul Tubiana for \\"Leon.\\" In 2012, the Foundation participated in the \\"New Settings\\" show for the promotion of the arts. In 2013, the Foundation supported the exhibition of works by young artists shown at the Palais de Tokyo. In January 2014, it has pledged a three-year support of the Cité internationale of Aubusson tapestry. The Foundation operates several contemporary art spaces, including La Verrière in Brussels, Belgium, Le Forum in Tokyo, Japan, and Atelier Hermès in Seoul, South Korea. Shareholder structure By 31 December 2016, the Hermès family, as partners of Émile Hermès SARL and their family members, collectively owned 65.1% of the share capital of Hermès International S.A. through a number of asset holding companies and direct ownerships, which entitled the family to 74.8% of the voting rights on allocation of net income and 77.2% on all other matters.2016 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT HERMÈS INTERNATIONAL Luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH held 20.21% of shares (amassed in the latter half of 2010) and 13.08% of votes at the same date, with 0.39% of shares held as treasury stock and the remaining 16.61% as free float. Speculation that LVMH would launch a takeover bid for Hermès has been repeatedly denied by its chairman Bernard Arnault. Some industry insiders have been in doubt, such as René Weber, an analyst at Zürich's Vontobel Investment Banking, who has claimed: \\"Arnault is not afraid of a fight and a lot of his battles have been successful for him and his shareholders. Whether he can eventually succeed with [a takeover of] Hermès is still an open question.\\" Bertrand Puech, who chairs the main Hermès family holding company, has criticised LVMH's acquisition of Hermès shares and called on the company to reduce its stake by half.

His father was Duke Louis of Württemberg, brother of King Frederick I of Württemberg and Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia. His mother was Princess Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg, a great-granddaughter of George II of Great Britain through his eldest daughter Anne, Princess of Orange. Life In 1835, he married, morganatically, Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde (1812-1841), by whom he fathered three children: Claudine, Francis and Amalie. His wife was granted the title \\"Countess von Hohenstein\\". The children inherited their mother's title as Count or Countess von Hohenstein from birth, having no rights through their father to any royal title, status or inheritance. In 1841, his wife was killed — run over by horses after falling from her own horse — and he became mentally unstable, a condition which lasted for the rest of his life. In 1863, his three children were elevated to the rank of Prince and Princesses Fürst and Fürstin von Teck by King William I of Württemberg. In 1871, his son Francis was raised to the title \\"Duke of Teck\\" by King Charles I of Württemberg, five years after his marriage with Alexander's third cousin (in descent from George II of Great Britain), Princess Mary of Cambridge.

The 'Xiaohe princess' or 'Beauty of Loulan': the oldest Tarim mummy, dating to 3800 years ago The Tarim mummies are a series of mummies discovered in the Tarim Basin in present-day Xinjiang, China, which date from 1800 BC to the first centuries BC. The mummies, particularly the early ones, are frequently associated with the presence of the Indo-European Tocharian languages in the Tarim Basin,Baumer (2000), p. 28. although the evidence is not totally conclusive and many centuries separate these mummies from the first attestation of the Tocharian languages in writing. Victor H. Mair's team concluded that the mummies are Caucasoid, likely speakers of Indo-European languages such as the Tocharians. Archaeological record Satellite image of the Taklamakan Desert Sir Aurel Stein in the Tarim Basin, 1910 At the beginning of the 20th century, European explorers such as Sven Hedin, Albert von Le Coq and Sir Aurel Stein all recounted their discoveries of desiccated bodies in their search for antiquities in Central Asia.Mallory & Mair (2000), p. 10. Since then, numerous other mummies have been found and analyzed, many of them now displayed in the museums of Xinjiang. Most of these mummies were found on the eastern end of the Tarim Basin (around the area of Lopnur, Subeshi near Turpan, Loulan, Kumul), or along the southern edge of the Tarim Basin (Khotan, Niya, and Cherchen or Qiemo). The earliest Tarim mummies, found at Qäwrighul and dated to 1800 BCE, are of a Caucasian physical type whose closest affiliation is to the Bronze Age populations of southern Siberia, Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the Lower Volga.Mallory & Mair (2000), p. 237. The cemetery at Yanbulaq contained 29 mummies which date from 1100–500 BCE, 21 of which are Mongoloid—the earliest Mongoloid mummies found in the Tarim Basin—and eight of which are of the same Caucasian physical type found at Qäwrighul. Notable mummies are the tall, red-haired \\"Chärchän man\\" or the \\"Ur-David\\" (1000 BCE); his son (1000 BCE), a small 1-year-old baby with brown hair protruding from under a red and blue felt cap, with two stones positioned over its eyes; the \\"Hami Mummy\\" (c. 1400–800 BCE), a \\"red-headed beauty\\" found in Qizilchoqa; and the \\"Witches of Subeshi\\" (4th or 3rd century BCE), who wore black felt conical hats with a flat brim.Though modern Westerners tend to identify this type of hat as the headgear of a witch, there is evidence that these pointed hats were widely worn by both women and men in some Central Asian tribes. For instance, the Persian king Darius recorded a victory over the \\"Sakas of the pointed hats\\". The Subeshi headgear is likely an ethnic badge or a symbol of position in the society. Also found at Subeshi was a man with traces of a surgical operation on his abdomen; the incision is sewn up with sutures made of horsehair. The Taklamakan Desert is very dry, which helped considerably in the preservation of the mummies. Many of the mummies have been found in very good condition, owing to the dryness of the desert and the desiccation it produced in the corpses. The mummies share many typical Caucasian body features (tall stature, high cheekbones, deep-set eyes), and many of them have their hair physically intact, ranging in color from blond to red to deep brown, and generally long, curly and braided. Their costumes, and especially textiles, may indicate a common origin with Indo-European neolithic clothing techniques or a common low-level textile technology. Chärchän man wore a red twill tunic and tartan leggings. Textile expert Elizabeth Wayland Barber, who examined the tartan-style cloth, discusses similarities between it and fragments recovered from salt mines associated with the Hallstatt culture. As a result of the arid conditions and exceptional preservation, tattoos have been identified on mummies from several sites around the Tarim Basin, including Qäwrighul, Yanghai, Shengjindian, Shanpula (Sampul), Zaghunluq, and Qizilchoqa. It has been asserted that the textiles found with the mummies are of an early European textile type based on close similarities to fragmentary textiles found in salt mines in Austria, dating from the second millennium BCE. Anthropologist Irene Good, a specialist in early Eurasian textiles, noted the woven diagonal twill pattern indicated the use of a rather sophisticated loom and said that the textile is \\"the easternmost known example of this kind of weaving technique.\\" Genetic studies Caucasoid mask from Lop Nur, China, 2000–1000 BCE In 1995, Mair claims that \\"the earliest mummies in the Tarim Basin were exclusively Caucasoid, or Europoid\\" with east Asian migrants arriving in the eastern portions of the Tarim Basin around 3,000 years ago while the Uyghur peoples arrived around the year 842. In trying to trace the origins of these populations, Victor Mair's team suggested that they may have arrived in the region by way of the Pamir Mountains about 5,000 years ago. Mair has claimed that: In 2007 the Chinese government allowed a National Geographic Society team headed by Spencer Wells to examine the mummies' DNA. Wells was able to extract undegraded DNA from the internal tissues. The scientists extracted enough material to suggest the Tarim Basin was continually inhabited from 2000 BCE to 300 BCE and preliminary results indicate the people, rather than having a single origin, originated from Europe, Mesopotamia, Indus Valley and other regions yet to be determined. A 2008 study by Jilin University showed that the Yuansha population has relatively close relationships with the modern populations of South Central Asia and Indus Valley, as well as with the ancient population of Chawuhu.Mitochondrial DNA analysis of human remains from the Yuansha site in Xinjiang Science in China Series C: Life Sciences Volume 51, Number 3 / March, 2008 Between 2009–2015, the remains of 92 individuals found at the Xiaohe Tomb complex were analyzed for Y-DNA and mtDNA markers. Genetic analyses of the mummies showed that the maternal lineages of the Xiaohe people originated from both East Asia and West Eurasia, whereas the paternal lineages all originated from West Eurasia. Mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that maternal lineages carried by the people at Xiaohe included mtDNA haplogroups H, K, U5, U7, U2e, T and R*, which are now most common in West Eurasia. Also found were haplogroups common in modern populations from East Asia: B5, D and G2a. Haplogroups now common in Central Asian or Siberian populations included: C4 and C5. Haplogroups later regarded as typically South Asian included M5 and M*. Of the paternal lines of male remains surveyed nearly all – 11 out of 12, or around 92% – belonged to Y-DNA haplogroup R1a1, which are now most common in West Eurasia; the other belonged to the exceptionally rare paragroup K* (M9).Zhōngguó běifāng gǔdài rénqún Y rǎnsètǐ yíchuán duōyàng xìng yánjiū--“jílín dàxué”2012 nián bóshì lùnwén. The R1a1 lineage suggests a proximity of this population with groups related to the Andronovo culture, i.e. early Indo-Europeans. The geographic location of this admixing is unknown, although south Siberia is likely. The Beauty of Loulan - full view Chinese historian Ji Xianlin says China \\"supported and admired\\" research by foreign experts into the mummies. \\"However, within China a small group of ethnic separatists have taken advantage of this opportunity to stir up trouble and are acting like buffoons. Some of them have even styled themselves the descendants of these ancient 'white people' with the aim of dividing the motherland. But these perverse acts will not succeed.\\" Barber addresses these claims by noting that \\"The Loulan Beauty is scarcely closer to 'Turkic' in her anthropological type than she is to Han Chinese. The body and facial forms associated with Turks and Mongols began to appear in the Tarim cemeteries only in the first millennium BCE, fifteen hundred years after this woman lived.\\" Due to the \\"fear of fuelling separatist currents\\", the Xinjiang museum, regardless of dating, displays all their mummies, both Tarim and Han, together. Posited origins Tocharian donors\\", with light hair and light eye color, 7th century CE fresco, Qizil, Tarim Basin, Xinjiang, China. Mallory amd Mair (2000) propose the movement of at least two Caucasian physical types into the Tarim Basin. The authors associate these types with the Tocharian and Iranian (Saka) branches of the Indo-European language family, respectively.Mallory & Mair (2000), pp. 317–318. However, archaeology and linguistics professor Elizabeth Wayland Barber cautions against assuming the mummies spoke Tocharian, noting a gap of about a thousand years between the mummies and the documented Tocharians: \\"people can change their language at will, without altering a single gene or freckle.\\" B. E. Hemphill's biodistance analysis of cranial metrics (as cited in and ) has questioned the identification of the Tarim Basin population as European, noting that the earlier population has close affinities to the Indus Valley population, and the later population with the Oxus River valley population. Because craniometry can produce results which make no sense at all (e.g. the close relationship between Neolithic populations in Ukraine and Portugal) and therefore lack any historical meaning, any putative genetic relationship must be consistent with geographical plausibility and have the support of other evidence.Mallory & Mair (2000), p. 236. Han Kangxin, who examined the skulls of 302 mummies, found the closest relatives of the earlier Tarim Basin population in the populations of the Afanasevo culture situated immediately north of the Tarim Basin and the Andronovo culture that spanned Kazakhstan and reached southwards into West Central Asia and the Altai.Mallory & Mair (2000), pp. 236–237.

It is the Afanasevo culture to which trace the earliest Bronze Age settlers of the Tarim and Turpan basins. The Afanasevo culture (c. 3500–2500 BCE) displays cultural and genetic connections with the Indo- European-associated cultures of the Eurasian Steppe yet predates the specifically Indo-Iranian-associated Andronovo culture (c. 2000–900 BCE) enough to isolate the Tocharian languages from Indo-Iranian linguistic innovations like satemization.Mallory & Mair (2000), pp. 260, 294–296, 314–318. confirm a second Caucasian physical type at Alwighul (700–1 BCE) and Krorän (200 CE) different from the earlier one found at Qäwrighul (1800 BCE) and Yanbulaq (1100–500 BCE): Mallory and Mair associate this later (700 BCE–200 CE) Caucasian physical type with the populations who introduced the Iranian Saka language to the western part of the Tarim basin.Mallory & Mair (2000), p. 318. Mair concluded: Historical records and associated textsChinese sources= Western Regions (Hsi-yu; ) is the historical name in China, between the 3rd century BCE and 8th century CE for regions west of Yumen Pass, including the Tarim and Central Asia. Some of the peoples of the Western Regions were described in Chinese sources as having full beards, red or blond hair, deep-set blue or green eyes and high noses.Mair, Victor H., \\"Mummies of the Tarim Basin,\\" Archaeology, vol. 48 (1995), no. 2 (March/April), p. 30 (article pp. 28-35). According to Chinese sources, the city states of the Tarim reached the height of their political power during the 3rd to 4th centuries CE,Yu (2003), pp. 34–57, 77–88, 96–103. although this may actually indicate an increase in Chinese involvement in the Tarim, following the collapse of the Kushan Empire. =The Yuezhi= Reference to the Yuezhi name in Guanzi was made around 7th century BCE by the Chinese economist Guan Zhong, though the book is generally considered to be a forgery of later generations. The attributed author, Guan Zhong, described the Yuzhi 禺氏, or Niuzhi 牛氏, as a people from the north-west who supplied jade to the Chinese from the nearby mountains of Yuzhi 禺氏 at Gansu. After the Yuezhi experienced a series of major defeats at the hands of the Xiongnu, during the 2nd century BCE, a group known as the Greater Yuezhi migrated to Bactria, where they established the Kushan Empire. By the 1st Century CE, the Kushan Empire had expanded significantly and may have annexed part of the Tarim Basin. =Tocharian languages= Wooden tablet with an inscription showing Tocharian B in its Brahmic form. Kucha, China, 5th-8th century (Tokyo National Museum) The degree of differentiation between the language known to modern scholars as Tocharian A (or by the endonym Ārśi-käntwa; \\"tongue of Ārśi\\") and Tocharian B (Kuśiññe; [adjective] \\"of Kucha, Kuchean\\"), as well as the less-well attested Tocharian C (which is associated with the city-state of Krorän, also known as Loulan), and the absence of evidence for these beyond the Tarim, tends to indicate that a common, proto-Tocharian language existed in the Tarim during the second half of the 1st Millennium BCE. Tocharian is attested in documents between the 3rd and 9th centuries CE, although the first known epigraphic evidence dates to the 6th century CE. Although the Tarim mummies preceded the Tocharian texts by several centuries, their shared geographical location and links to Western Eurasia have led many scholars to infer that the mummies were related to the Tocharian peoples. Arguments for the occurrence of cultural transmission from West to East The possible presence of speakers of Indo- European languages in the Tarim Basin by about 2000 BCEMallory and Mair (2000), pp. 317-318. could, if confirmed, be interpreted as evidence that cultural exchanges occurred among Indo-European and Chinese populations at a very early date. It has been suggested that such activities as chariot warfare and bronze-making may have been transmitted to the east by these Indo-European nomads. Mallory and Mair also note that: \\"Prior to c. 2000 BC, finds of metal artifacts in China are exceedingly few, simple and, puzzlingly, already made of alloyed copper (and hence questionable).\\" While stressing that the argument as to whether bronze technology travelled from China to the West or that \\"the earliest bronze technology in China was stimulated by contacts with western steppe cultures\\", is far from settled in scholarly circles, they suggest that the evidence so far favours the latter scenario.Mallory and Mair (2000), pp. 327-328. However, the culture and the technology in the northwest region of Tarim basin were less advanced than that in the East China of Yellow River- Erlitou (2070 BCE ~ 1600 BCE) or Majiayao culture (3100 BCE ~ 2600 BCE), the earliest bronze-using cultures in China, which implies that the northwest region did not use copper or any metal until bronze technology was introduced to the region by the Shang dynasty in about 1600 BC. The earliest bronze artifacts in China are found at the Majiayao culture site (between 3100 and 2700 BC), and it is from this location and time period that Chinese Bronze Age spread. Bronze metallurgy in China originated in what is referred to as the Erlitou () period, which some historians argue places it within the range of dates controlled by the Shang dynasty.Chang, K. C.: \\"Studies of Shang Archaeology\\", pp. 6–7, 1. Yale University Press, 1982. Others believe the Erlitou sites belong to the preceding Xia () dynasty.Chang, K. C.: \\"Studies of Shang Archaeology\\", p. 1. Yale University Press, 1982. The US National Gallery of Art defines the Chinese Bronze Age as the \\"period between about 2000 BC and 771 BC,\\" which begins with Erlitou culture and ends abruptly with the disintegration of Western Zhou rule. Though that provides a concise frame of reference, it overlooks the continued importance of bronze in Chinese metallurgy and culture. Since that was significantly later than the discovery of bronze in Mesopotamia, bronze technology could have been imported, rather than being discovered independently in China. However, there is reason to believe that bronzework developed inside China, separately from outside influence.Li-Liu; The Chinese Neolithic, Cambridge University Press, 2005Shang and Zhou Dynasties: The Bronze Age of China Heilbrunn Timeline Retrieved May 13, 2010 The Chinese official Zhang Qian, who visited Bactria and Sogdiana in 126 BCE, made the first known Chinese report on many regions west of China. He believed to have discerned Greek influences in some of the kingdoms. He named Parthia \\"Ānxī\\" (Chinese: 安息), a transcription of \\"Arshak\\" (Arsaces), the name of the founder of Parthian dynasty.The Kingdom of Anxi Zhang Qian clearly identified Parthia as an advanced urban civilization that farmed grain and grapes and manufactured silver coins and leather goods.Silk Road, North China, C. Michael Hogan, The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham (2007) Zhang Qian equated Parthia's level of advancement to the cultures of Dayuan in Ferghana and Daxia in Bactria. The supplying of Tarim Basin jade to China from ancient times is well established, according to : \\"It is well known that ancient Chinese rulers had a strong attachment to jade. All of the jade items excavated from the tomb of Fuhao of the Shang dynasty by Zheng Zhenxiang, more than 750 pieces, were from Khotan in modern Xinjiang. As early as the mid- first millennium BCE the Yuezhi engaged in the jade trade, of which the major consumers were the rulers of agricultural China.\\"  The Beauty of Loulan  The Beauty of Loulan - closeup The Beauty of Loulan (also referred to as the Loulan Beauty) is the most famous of the Tarim mummies, along with the Cherchen Man. She was discovered in 1980 by Chinese archaeologists working on a film about the Silk Road. The mummy was discovered near Lop Nur. She was buried 3 feet beneath the ground. The mummy was extremely well preserved because of the dry climate and the preservative properties of salt. She was wrapped in a woolen cloth; the cloth was made of two separate pieces and was not large enough to cover her entire body, thereby leaving her ankles exposed. The Beauty of Loulan was surrounded by funerary gifts. The Beauty of Loulan has been dated back to approximately 1800 BCE. = Life and death = The Beauty of Loulan lived around 1800 BCE, until about the age of 45, when she died. Her cause of death is likely due to lung failure from ingesting a large amount of sand, charcoal, and dust. According to Elizabeth Barber, she probably died in the winter because of her provisions against the cold. The rough shape of her clothes and the lice in her hair suggest she lived a difficult life. = Appearance and clothing  Hair  The Beauty of Loulan's hair colour has been described as auburn. Her hair was infested with lice.  Clothing  The Beauty of Loulan is wearing clothing made of wool and fur. Her hood is made of felt and has a feather in it.Mair, V. H. (2010). The mummies of east central Asia. Expedition, 52(3), 23-32. She is wearing rough ankle-high moccasins made of leather, with fur on the outside. Her skirt is made of leather, with fur on the inside for warmth. She is also wearing a woolen cap. According to Elizabeth Barber, these provisions against the cold suggest she died during the winter.  Accessories  The Loulan Beauty possesses a comb, with four teeth remaining. Barber suggests that this comb was a dual purpose tool to comb hair and to \\"pack the weft in tightly during weaving.\\" She possesses a \\"neatly woven bag or soft basket.\\" Grains of wheat were discovered inside the bag. = Political controversies = When the Loulan Beauty was discovered, it caused excitement among the local Uyghur population of Xinjiang.Allen, T. B. (1996). Xinjiang. National Geographic, 189(3), 2-43.Bader, A. C., & Rollefson, G. (2012). Mummy dearest: questions of identity in modern and ancient Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. There was even a pop song written praising the Beauty of Loulan; the song became quite popular. Some Uyghurs have named her the mother of the nation because they say the Uyghurs are her descendants. The Beauty of Loulan has become a figurehead of the Uyghur separatist movement in Xinjiang. This has caused frustration among some scholars and historians because, according to their work, the Uyghurs are not descendants of the Tarim mummies or the Beauty of Loulan. = In Popular Culture = A 23-poem sequence on the Beauty of Loulan appears in the Canadian poet Kim Trainor's Karyotype (2015).  Controversies  According to Ed Wong's New York Times article from 2008, Mair was actually prohibited from leaving the country with 52 genetic samples. However, a Chinese scientist clandestinely sent him half a dozen, on which an Italian geneticist performed tests. Since then China has prohibited foreign scientists from conducting research on the mummies. As Wong says, \\"Despite the political issues, excavations of the grave sites are continuing.\\" See also * Pazyryk culture * Pontic-Caspian steppe * Dzungarian Gate * Gushi culture FootnotesReferences * * Baumer, Christoph.

The song figures in the early careers of two important female singers: # In 1947, Doris Day was making a transition from a Big band singer, most recently with Les Brown, to a solo vocalist. Her first major record away from the band was a duet with Buddy Clark, with this song on one side and \\"Love Somebody\\" on the other.Columbia Records in the 38000 to 38499 series The record became a two-sided hit, the first two of a string of hits for Day that made her one of the top female singers in popular music. # About the same time, Mercury Records was planning to record the song as a vehicle for Frankie Laine. They were persuaded instead to give the song to a young female singer, who had not, at the time, a single hit: Patti Page. Page's manager, Jack Rael, succeeded in getting Mercury to let her record the song, but because of a low budget, a second singer could not be hired, so guitarist George Barnes (musician), whose trio accompanied Page on the record, and who had been experimenting with multi-track recording with engineer Bill Putnam, suggested that Page sing the second part as well. The novelty of her doing two voices on one record probably contributed to the song becoming a top 20 hit for her. This became not only the first of many hits for Patti Page, but the first song on which a singer did more than one track. For Patti Page, multi-tracking became a trademark of her style, while others, such as Les Paul and Mary Ford, as well as Jane Turzy, took up this practice too. The Day/Clark recording was recorded on November 21, 1947, and issued by Columbia Records as catalog number 38174, and first reached the Billboard chart on June 26, 1948, lasting 11 weeks and peaking at #16 on the chart.

He was most noted for his victory over Confederate General Stephen D. Lee at the Battle of Tupelo, Mississippi, on July 14, 1864. In retaliation for Forrest’s raid on Fort Pillow, north of Memphis, Union General Andrew Jackson (Whiskey) Smith, with a large military force, arrived in Oxford, MS on August 24, 1864, and in one day burned the Lafayette County Courthouse, all the business houses on the Square, except one, and all homes in the immediate area. Early life Smith was born in rural Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1838 ranking 36th in a class of 45 graduates. He entered West Point with his kin Langdon C. Easton of St. Louis, who was Chief Quartermaster of General William T. Sherman's 100,000-man army. Smith was engaged on active service on the frontier in the Southwest and in the Mexican–American War, in the latter briefly commanding the Mormon Battalion. He later fought against Native Americans in the Washington and Oregon territories. He was successively promoted to first lieutenant in 1845, captain in 1847, and major in early 1861. Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War, Smith became a colonel of the 2nd California Volunteer Cavalry in the Union Army, rising early in 1862 to the rank of brigadier general in the United States Volunteers and to the chief command of the cavalry in the Department of the Missouri. From March through July, he served in the same capacity in the Department of the Mississippi. Assigned afterwards to the Army of the Tennessee, he took part in the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou and the capture of Arkansas Post. He commanded a division of the XIII Corps in the Vicksburg Campaign. Later, he led a division of the XVI Corps in the Red River Campaign of Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks. He received the brevet rank of colonel in the regular army for his services at the action of Pleasant Hill. In July 1864, Smith became a lieutenant colonel in the regular army, to rank from May April 10, 1864. On May 14, 1864 President Abraham Lincoln appointed Smith a major general in the volunteers, to rank from May 12, 1864, the date of the United States Senate's confirmation of President Lincoln's May 9, 1864 nomination of Smith for the appointment.Eicher, 2001, p. 705. On July 14-15, 1864, Smith defeated Confederate Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee at the Battle of Tupelo, where he, after General Nathan Bedford Forrest refused to take charge of the Confederate forces on the field. During the autumn of 1864, Smith lead Union troops against Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price during Price's Raid into Missouri. Smith was then summoned to join forces with Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas at Nashville, Tennessee, then threatened by the advance of Confederate Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood. Smith bore a conspicuous share in the crowning victory at the Battle of Nashville leading his troops past the Confederates' south flank. He commanded the XVI corps in the final campaign against Mobile, Alabama, in 1865. On April 10, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Smith for appointment to the grade of brigadier general in the United States Army (Regular Army), to rank from March 13, 1865, for his services at the Battle of Tupelo and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 737. On the same dates, President Johnson nominated and the United States Senate confirmed Johnson's appointment of Smith as brevet major general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865 for his success in leading his men at the Battle of Nashville.Eicher, 2011, p. 709. The Senate reconfirmed this appointment on July 14, 1866 after recalling the confirmation and return of the nomination to President Johnson for possible readjustment of the date.Eicher 2001, p. 710. Postbellum life Smith resigned his volunteer commission and was mustered out of the volunteers on January 15, 1866. He then became colonel of the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment, serving in the American West. He retired from the military service in April 1869 to become postmaster of St. Louis, Missouri, where he died on January 30, 1897.

It is a designated place and had 1,037 residents and 458 dwellings as of the 2011 census. Tara is in geographic Arran Township and is located on the Sauble River. It has an area of and an urban area that covers . Tara is in the federal electoral district of Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound and in the provincial electoral district of the same name. Tara Siding is just to the south of the community on the right (opposite) bank of the Sauble River. It was created in 1855 by the building of the Stratford and Huron Railway (later Grand Trunk Railway; later Canadian National Railway Owen Sound Subdivision; abandoned 1993). History Richard Berford and John Hamilton were the first European settlers to move onto and survey the lots of the future village of Tara in 1851. The opening of the road from Southampton to Owen Sound in 1852 helped the early growth of the community, as the village is located approximately half-way in between the two larger towns. Shortly after, Hamilton opened a hotel, serving the incoming settlers of the surrounding townships.Robertson, 274-275. A post-office opened in 1862 with the name, Eblana, however it was changed the following year to Tara, after a town in County Meath, Ireland which served as the seat of Irish royalty.Robertson, 274-276. In 1880, the local newspaper, The Tara Leader was first published, and the following year the railroad was built to the community and the first locomotive arrived.Robertson, 277. In 1855, a sawmill opened by H. W. M. Richards, becoming the first \\"manufacturing industry\\"; a grist mill was added to it in 1857. Two years later, a large foundry and agricultural implement works was started by W. A. Gerolamy. Other earlier businesses included a steam sawmill, a woolen mill and a potash factory. The first post office opened in 1862. The railway reached Tara in October 1881. The village never did become a major manufacturing centre. The Government of Ontario has erected a historic plaque in Tara, offering a glimpse into the past of this area. The plaque titled THE FOUNDING OF TARA reads as follows. \\"Soon after the survey of Arran Township was completed in 1851. John Hamilton and Richard Berford, early settlers in the area, located here along the Sauble River. The opening of the Owen Sound Post road stimulated the growth of a small community and in 1858 Berford registered a village plan. Situated in a rich agricultural region wuth abundant water power, the settlement developed quickly. By 1861 it contained saw and grist mills, a foundry producing agricultural implements, wagon works and a tannery, and the following year a post office was established. Tara became a thriving commercial and manufacturing centre and, in anticipation of the arrival of the Stratford and Huron Railway, it was incorporated as a village by a county by-law effective January 1, 1881.\\" EconomyTourism= The Arran-Tara Agricultural Society holds an annual fair, the Arran-Tara Fall Fair; it was first held in 1858.

Career Weiss was born in a Jewish family, and originally planned a career as a lawyer or accountant, but out of a love for music he was led to attend the Juilliard School of Music, developing his skills in writing and arranging. After leaving school, he became an arranger for such big bands as those of Stan Kenton, Vincent Lopez, and Johnny Richards. He was a very prolific songwriter during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, with many of his songs attaining high rankings on the charts. Although he worked with many collaborators, the largest proportion of his well-known songs were written with Bennie Benjamin. Weiss contributed to a number of film scores: Murder, Inc. (1960), Gidget Goes to Rome (1963), Mediterranean Holiday (1964), and Mademoiselle (1966). Collaborations on three Broadway musicals were among his compositions. Mr. Wonderful was written in 1956 with Jerry Bock and Larry Holofcener. The Broadway production starred Sammy Davis, Jr. First Impressions was based on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. It was written in 1959, with Bo Goldman and Glenn Paxton. Maggie Flynn was written in 1968, with Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore.

He played guitar and banjo with various orchestras at the Savoy Ballroom and the Cotton Club, and elsewhere, and toured with Olsen and Johnson. Although he wrote songs and attempted to sell them, he had little success until starting work at a music publishing firm, and forming a songwriting partnership in the mid-1930s with New York-born composer Sol Marcus (1912-1976). With Marcus, Eddie Durham and Eddie Seiler (1911-1952), he wrote \\"I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire\\", which was first recorded in 1941 by Harlan Leonard and his Kansas City Rockers, and then more successfully by The Ink Spots, whose version reached number 4 on the pop chart, and Horace Heidt, whose recording rose to number 1. The song won Billboard's \\"Top Songwriter's Award\\" for 1941. Benjamin, Marcus and Seiler then wrote a second number 1 hit, \\"When the Lights Go On Again (All Over the World)\\", recorded by Vaughn Monroe and associated in Britain with Vera Lynn.

What It Seemed to Be\\", a 1946 hit for Frank Sinatra, Frankie Carle, and others; Perry Como's number 1 hit \\"Surrender\\"; and \\"Rumors Are Flying\\", a number 1 hit in 1946 for Frankie Carle and also a hit for the Andrews Sisters and others. They also wrote together for the Disney films Fun and Fancy Free and Melody Time.

Personal life Rubinstein was born in Baker Street, London. His father, a milliner, sent him to Hampstead's University College School. Already in the Territorial Army from the age of 16, he enlisted in the Royal Engineers as the war broke out. In 1941 he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery as a searchlight officer. After converting from Judaism to the Church of England, he married Gay, with whom he had been friends since their childhood, in 1943. Shortly after the wedding he volunteered for the Special Operations Executive, and began training in Peterborough before his first mission to France. Rubinstein is the great great grandfather of comedian Jolyon Rubinstein. Career He led the Special Operations Executive Jedburgh team that was parachuted safely, despite ground fire, into Brittany on the night of 6 August 1944, bearing five million francs for the French Resistance. The following weeks were spent with the SAS and the Forces Français de L'Interieur helping to land gliders loaded with arms and hiding in an oyster farm between operations. The mission was a success, and resulted in most of the region being cleared of German forces by the end of the month. The Jeds returned to France on 15 September parachuting into eastern France close to the Swiss border, there to gather intelligence on enemy movements and to help repel the German troops. He was mentioned in dispatches, and awarded the Croix de Guerre. In December 1944, he and two colleagues were parachuted into northern Burma to gather intelligence on Japanese supply lines and to stoke the resistance movement among the local Kachins, who were sympathetic to the Allied forces. Again it would be a successful mission, with the guerilla groups organised by Rubinstein taking a heavy toll on the enemy. He had similar success in an operation in April 100 miles to the east. The 200 guerilla fighters he raised carried out ambushes on Japanese troops and captured weaponry. After two months, he led his team south to Toungoo to join forces holding back the Japanese advance on Siam. After the war, in which he reached the rank of Major, Rubinstein stayed in the Territorial Army, transferring to the Parachute Regiment in 1950.Sugarman, Martin.

A protected view or protected vista is the legal requirement within urban planning to preserve the view of a specific place or historic building from another location. The effect of a protected view is to limit the height of new buildings within or adjacent to the sightline between the two places so as to preserve the ability to see the landmark as a focus of the view. The protection may also cover the area behind the place or building concerned. For example, in London views of St Paul's Cathedral are protected from various prominent locations around the city. In Edinburgh, a 2005 skyline study compiled a list of almost 170 key views which will now be protected in the planning process. Protected views are not unique to the UK, also existing in places such as San Francisco which has some of the strictest limits in the world; Portland, Oregon where the size of downtown blocks is kept low to maintain the views of Mount Hood from the West Hills; and the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, which has protected \\"view cones\\".

The party was registered with the Electoral Commission in 2005, although its registration has since lapsed.  History and activities  Founded in 2004 by majority-BNP members, the NA sought to build a closer alliance with other groups on the far right that were not affiliated with and worked outside of the British National Party. One such alliance was a potential merge with the Freedom Party, though this did not come to pass, as Adrian Davies, chairman of the party, felt reluctant to join with some of the more extremist elements of the NA.Searchlight, No. 363, September 2005, p. 25 Seeking to further ties with other far-right activists, the party held a meeting attended by members of the White Nationalist Party and the National Front at Rawdon Conservative Club in September 2005 as a memorial to John Tyndall, British fascist political activist and previous chairman of the National Front. The event featured an address by a number of notable far-right nationalists, such as Richard Edmonds, member of the BNP, Eddy Morrison, NA party leader and ex-leader of the White Nationalist Party, and John Wood, former senior member of the WNP.Searchlight, No. 364, October 2005, p. 9 Towards the end of the meeting, the club had some of its windows smashed by unknown assailants; the club secretary later stated that the event had been booked under a false address with the booking secretary, and that he had been unaware of the nature of the group before the event took place.  Split  The meeting held at Rawdon brought media attention upon both the NA and the far-right activists affiliated with the event, and leading to its eventual split. A photograph of some of the members inside the meeting appeared in an edition of Searchlight magazine, leading to accusations made amongst the activists as to where and from whom the image had come from. Along with the failure of the Freedom Party initiative and the rise of ideological clashes within the party, the NA split in September of 2005, with Morrison, Wood and Watmough breaking off to form the British Peoples Party.Searchlight, No. 368, February 2006, p. 13 The split led to recriminations across the far-right movement, Morrison himself being verbally attacked by Martin Webster - former far-right leader and political activist - on Webster's online bulletin, Webster having accused Morrison of simply using the NA as a way to collect money from its members, a charge Morrison denied.Searchlight, No. 366, December 2005, p. 26  Existing party activities and membership drift  Despite the split, the Nationalist Alliance continued to operate as a political entity, offering a political platform for nativist politics in favour of deportation, capital punishment and white nationalism. The Alliance - largely under the direction of former Burnly BNP activist Sharon Pastow - continued their moves towards a wider alliance amongst the far-right in Britain by working closely with the National Front and the England First Party (EFP), whilst holding a large dual membership with the Wolf's Hook White Brotherhood, a splinter group of the BNP founded in 2004.Searchlight, No. 379, January 2007, p. 17 The white supremacist organisation Patriots of the White European Resistance (\\"P.O.W.E.R.\\") described the NA as a \\"brother of the 816\\" in an April 2007 newsletter, referring to the greeting of \\"816\\" reported to have been used by members of the organisation. It was reported by Searchlight that at least at least four known members of the NA were known to have been members of the online forums run by P.O.W.E.R. at some point. In November 2006, a prominent member of the Nationalist Alliance, Mick \\"Belsen\\" Sanderson, was stabbed to death in Nottingham following a fight with fellow NA member John Pakulski.Searchlight, No. 379, January 2007, p. 23 Pakulski was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for manslaughter for the murder, whilst fellow member Catherine Parker-Brown received a community order for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after she was found to have attempted to clean the scene of the crime.Searchlight, No. 391, January 2008, p. 23 Parker-Brown had been a former organiser for the BNP in the East Midlands and was formerly the nominal leader of the NA, though their membership had later become largely interchangeable with the increasingly more prominent EFP.Searchlight, No. 388, October 2007, p. 16 The Wolf's Hook White Brotherhood - which had been considered a sister organisation to the NA - has since ceased to exist, with most of its membership transferring to the Racial Volunteer Force. Beyond a former internet presence and its occasional publication Axiom (succeeding its two previous publications, Vanguard and Imperium, which have since been published by the BNP), the party is by and large defunct.  Previous use of the name  The name had been used 'in house' for an initiative driven by Andrew Brons to achieve a reconciliation and joint electoral action between the Flag Group and the BNP in 1986, a move which ultimately came to nothing. The modern incarnation of the Nationalist Alliance has no connection to this proposal.

Within this small village are the notable ruins of Farleigh Hungerford Castle, which played a significant part in the English Civil War. Evidence has also been found of occupation during Roman times; the foundations of a villa were excavated in a field just north west of the castle in 1822. From 1985 to 2010 the village was the venue for the annual Trowbridge Village Pump Festival. History The manor was called Farleigh Montfort from just after the conquest when it was owned by a Norman family, the Montforts, until the fourteenth century. Then Reginald de Montfort sold the estate to one of Edward III’s soldiers whose family held it only for about a quarter of a century. In 1369 AD Sir Thomas de Hungerford bought the house from the childless daughter of the recently deceased squire, and the house later came to be known as Farleigh Hungerford. The parish of Farleigh Hungerford was part of the Wellow Hundred. Farleigh Hungerford Castle gateway It is the location of Farleigh Hungerford Castle, built around 1370 and owned by English Heritage and the former home of Sir Thomas Hungerford, Speaker of the House of Commons. In the early 15th century, his son, Sir Walter Hungerford, enlarged the castle by adding the outer court that enclosed the parish church, St Leonard's, which he used as his chapel. It is thought that he built the present parish church nearby to replace it. In the Civil War, Sir Edward Hungerford (1596-1648) commanded the Parliamentary forces of Wiltshire briefly. His half-brother, Col John Hungerford, was a Royalist and was given the command of the garrison of Farleigh in 1644. However he surrendered to Sir Edward without fighting in 1645.John Wroughton, ‘Hungerford, Sir Edward (1596–1648)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 at www.oxforddnb.com and in print A later Sir Edward Hungerford (1632-1711), who had been MP for Chippenham during Richard Cromwell's brief reign,Timothy Venning, ‘Hungerford, Sir Edward (1632–1711)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 at www.oxforddnb.com entertained Charles II of England at Farleigh in about 1675. After the discovery of the Rye House Plot in 1683, the castle was raided by the government and weapons were seized. The spendthrift Sir Edward was the last male of his family, but by the time of his death he had already sold the castle (in 1686) to Henry Bayntun for £56,000.Venning, ‘Hungerford, Sir Edward (1632–1711)’, Oxford DNB at www.oxforddnb.com Enclosed by a curtain wall with a cylindrical tower at each corner, the squarish inner bailey contained a selection of domestic buildings. Today only two of the towers and some sections of the curtain wall survive. The south west tower stands almost to its full height of five storeys in places, but the south east tower exists only a little more than its third floor. It is a grade I listed building. Farleigh House Farleigh House is a large country house, previously the centre of the Farleigh Hungerford estate, and has sometimes been called Farleigh New Castle. The present building was started in the 18th century but is mainly an early 19th-century Gothic Revival building. In 2010 it was converted to be used as the offices and training centre of Bath Rugby. Church of St Leonard St Leonards Church The Anglican parish Church of St Leonard was consecrated in 1443, and remodelled in 1856. It was once within the outer walls of the castle but is now separated from it by the main road. The church, which is a grade II* listed building, has a perpendicular style West Tower in 3 stages, with a pair of stone gargoyles on each face. There are the remains of some 14th-century stained glass in the north window of the nave and in the east Chancel window which are of Flemish origin. The church also contains a 17th-century wooden altar rail carved with open work scrolls and figures. The pulpit dates from the early 18th century and is carved with eagles and angels.

Along with Viringili, it is on Maliku atoll, the southernmost atoll of Lakshadweep archipelago. Administratively, it is a census town in the Indian union territory of Lakshadweep. The island is situated 398km west of Trivandrum, the capital city of Kerala. Etymology Minicoy is known as Maliku in the local language, Divehi, which is also the national and official language of the Republic of Maldives. The language is a descendant of Elu Prakrit and is closely related to the Sinhala language, but not mutually intelligible with it. However, the Lakhshadweep Administration refers to Divehi as Mahl. This is due to a misunderstanding on the part of a British civil servant who came to Minicoy in the 1900's during the time of the British Raj. The official asked a local what his language was and he replied \\"Divehi-bas\\". The official looked confused as he had never heard of this language. Noticing this, the islander said \\"Mahaldeebu\\" as he knew that locals on the subcontinent referred to the kingdom to the south (the Maldives) by that name. The civil servant then official recorded the language of Minicoy as Mahl.http://www.maldivesroyalfamily.com/minicoy.shtml The ancient name of Maliku was Mahiladū meaning women's island. Mahiladū derives from Elu Prakrit term Mahila du, which literally means woman-island.Asianet News - മിനികോയ് ദ്വീപ്‌ അകലങ്ങളിലെ ഇന്ത്യ However, the name Maliku is thought to have been derived from the Arab trader's term for the island, Jazirat al-Maliku ('the island of the king').

The Andaman and Nicobar Islands had a reputation in the Maldives and Minicoy of being inhabited by cannibals, and so collectively the Andaman and Nicobar groups were called \\"Minikaa-raajje\\" by Maldive and Minicoy islanders. This meant \\"cannibal kingdom\\". A British official once asked a Minicoy islander what the name of his island was. The islander told the official that he was from Maliku but usually lived in \\"Minikaa-raajje\\" (Nicobar). The official thought Maliku and Minikaa were the same place and recorded the name of this islander's home as \\"Minikaa\\". This later became anglicised as Minicoy.http://www.maldivesroyalfamily.com/minicoy.shtml Little did this islander know that as a result of this cross-cultural exchange, his home would forever be called by a name that sounded like \\"cannibal\\" in his own language. Geography lepers of the island were banished. Minicoy is the second largest and the southernmost among the islands of the Lakshadweep archipelago. It is located 201 km to the southsouthwest of Kalpeni, at the southern end of the Nine Degree Channel and 125 km to the north of Thuraakunu, Maldives, at the northern end of the Eight Degree Channel. The atoll is 10 km in length, having a maximum breadth of about 6 km. The closest geographic feature is the Investigator Bank, a submerged shoal located 31 km to the northeast.Hydrographic Description (Indian Ocean Pilot) It is located 400 km west off the coast of Trivandrum. The atoll contains two islands. The main island is located on the eastern and southeastern side of the lagoon, along the reef fringe. It measures about 10 km from its northern end to its southernmost point and it is about 1 km wide in its southern half, while the northern half is a narrow sandspit, often less than 100 m wide. Minicoy is almost completely covered with coconut trees. One of the few landmarks of the island is a tall lighthouse. On the southern side of the main island lies the uninhabited islet of Viringili (Dhivehi: ވިރިންގިލި ; , also called the Small Pox Island), measuring barely 200 m in length. Formerly the lepers of Minicoy were banished to this island where they lived in abject conditions. Maliku Atoll has a lagoon with two entrances in its northern side, Saalu Magu on the northeast and Kandimma Magu on the northwest. Its western side is fringed by a narrow reef and coral rocks awash. The interior of the lagoon is sandy and of moderate depth, rarely reaching 4 m. It has some coral patches. This atoll is administered under the Indian Union Territory of Lakshadweep. Nine Degree Channel separates Minicoy and the Laccadive Islands. The closest island to Minicoy is Thuraakunu in the Republic of the Maldives. Since 1956, the Indian Government has forbidden the direct travelling between the two islands despite their geographic proximity and ethnographic similarities. Maliku Kandu is the traditional name of the broad channel between Minicoy (Maliku) and Ihavandippulhu (Haa Alif Atoll) in the Maldives. In the Admiralty Charts it is called Eight Degree Channel. Other names for this channel are Addigiri Kandu and Māmalē Kandu. It appeared in old French maps with the name Courant de Malicut. Map of Minicoy Atoll (Maliku) =Villages= There are total of eleven villages (athiris)(avah) in Minicoy Island. From North to South, they are: # Kendiparty # Pallessery # Kudehi # Funhilol # Aloodi # Sadivalu # New Boduathiri # Rammedu # Boduathiri # Aoumagu # Bada Climate Minicoy has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw) with warm temperatures throughout the year. Precipitation falls during most of the year; only January to March are relatively dry. History Buddhist era = There are remains in an area of the island known as \\"Salliballu\\" dating back from Minicoy's Buddhist past, about 800 years ago. The most conspicuous archaeological sites are two mounds or large heaps of ruins belonging to a stupa and another related structure. These sites were investigated by the Archaeological Survey of India in the 1980s. The excavations yielded few discoveries, for the sites had been much damaged and vandalized previously. Still, a much-damaged large Buddha head was found buried in the area. The name \\"Salliballu\\" originated in the local name for the \\"Christian cross\\", because the locals say that an inscription with a \\"cross\\" was found there. But it is likely that, coming from a Buddhist site, it was a cross-shaped mandala or visvavajra, like those often found on inscriptions in archaeological remains in the Maldives.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom. Barcelona 1999 Local oral tradition has it that Kamborani and Kohoratukamana, two princesses from the Maldives, came to Maliku. When they arrived, the tivaru, who had been living there before, left the island for Sri Lanka. The Kamborani's descendants are the bodun (land and shipowners) and the descendants of Kohoratukamana are the niamin (captains). The other status groups are made up of the descendants of their crew.Ellen Kattner, The Social Structure of Maliku (Minicoy), listed below (online). = Colonial era  Under suzerainty of East India Company  According to the documented evidence, Minicoy Atoll has been under Indian administrations since the mid 16th century. Until the 16th Century, the Laccadives was under the suzerainty of the Kolathiri Raja of Chirakkal in what is now the Indian state of Kerala. With the Portuguese ascendancy in the region, it became necessary for the Kolathiri to transfer sovereignty of the islands to their hereditary admiral, the Ali Raja of Kolathunadu (Cannanore). However, the kings and queens of the Maldives also issued edicts addressed to the subjects in their realm Malikaddu Midhemedhu. This meant \\"Between Maliku (Minicoy) and Addu\\". Previously Addu was the southernmost island in the dominions of the Maldive kings and was in Addu Atoll. A 1696 CE grant issued under the Seal of the King Siri Kula Ran Mani (Sultan Mohamed IV) of the Maldives, regarding the building and upkeep of a mosque in Finey at Thiladhummathi Atoll in Maldives, referred to him as Malikaddu Midhemedhu ekanuonna mi korhu anikaneh nethee korhu which meant \\"Sole Sovereign with no other over what lies between Maliku and Addu\\".  Under direct rule of British India  In 1857, suzerainty over Minicoy transferred from the East India Company to the Indian Empire when Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress. On 18 December 1790 Maliku was surrendered to the Court of Directors of the British East India Company by the Ali Raja Cannanore, Junumabe Ali-Adi Raja Bibi II. The Ali Raja was allowed to administer Maliku in return for a tribute to the East India Company. She continued to dispute the transfer of sovereignty but in 1824, her successor, Mariambe Ali-Adi Raja Bibi made a formal written recognition of the suzerainty of the East India Company over Maliku (Minicoy). She and her successors, however, continued the tributary arrangement. On 27 July 1795, the Governor General of the Presidency of Madras under whose jurisdiction Minicoy was, abolished Junumabe Ali Adi-Raja Bibi's monopoly over coir trade. In 1905 under the heavy burden of debts to the Empire, Mohamed Ali-Adi Raja of Cannanore agreed to surrender sovereignty and control over Minicoy. He died before the formal transfer. After an attempt to backtrack, his successor Imbicchi Ali-Adi Raja Bibi finally signed over Minicoy to the Emperor Edward VII on 9 February 1909, backdated to 1 July 1905. Following this, Minicoy was annexed to the District of Malabar.  After independence of India  1956 plebiscite and integration with India = After the independence of India in August 1947, the possessions of the Emperor of India passed to either the Indian Union or Pakistan according to an agreed demarcation line. The rulers of the princely state of British India had the choice of acceding to either India or Pakistan. Since Minicoy was earlier in a sovereign possession of the British Raj, India held a plebiscite in Minicoy in 1956 to determine whether or not the people of Minicoy wished to join the Indian Union. A referendum was held and an absolute majority of the Minicoy decided to join the Indian Union. = Union Territory of India = After the plebiscite, on 1 November 1956, Minicoy was incorporated into the Union Territory of Laccadive, Minicoy, and Aminidivi Islands, renamed Lakshadweep in 1973. At this time, the Maldives was still not independent from the British. = India-Maldives maritime treaty = Worm's-eye view of the Lighthouse in Minicoy island In December 1976, India and the Maldives signed a maritime boundary treaty whereby Minicoy was placed on the Indian side of the boundary.\\"India–Maldives: Agreement between India and the Maldives on Maritime Boundary in the Arabian Sea and Related Matters\\", in Jonathan I. Charney and Lewis M. Alexander (eds., 1998). International Maritime Boundaries (Leiden: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, ) pp. 1389–1399. India and Maldives officially and amicably decided their maritime boundary in 1976, in 1982 when the brother of the President of Maldives Maumoon Abdul Gayoom declared that the neighbouring Minicoy Island that belonged to India were a part of Maldives; Maldives quickly and officially denied that it was laying claim to the island.Ramesh Trivedi (2007). India's Relations with her Neighbours (Isha Books, ) p. 177. India and maldives continue to enjoy friendly relations and strategic partnership with economic and military cooperation. India continues to contribute to the security of the island nation of Maldives. Demographics India census, the island of Minicoy had a population of 9,495. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%. Minicoy has an average literacy rate of 82%, higher than the national average of 74.04%: male literacy is 84%, and female literacy is 80%. In Minicoy, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. The people of Minicoy are ethnically Dhivehis and make up the third subgroup of Dhivehis referred as Mahls. The people locally identify themselves as \\"Malikun\\". Culture A view of the shores of Minicoy Island. The cultural traits of Minicoy differ from those of any other island in Lakshadweep. Manners, customs, lifestyle and food are similar to those of the Maldives to the south of Minicoy and Malikubas (officially referred as Mahl by the Lakshadweep administration), a dialect of Dhivehi language, is spoken on the island.Clarence Maloney; People of the Maldive Islands Like in other Dhivehi-speaking communities, the right-to-left Tāna script is used for writing. The social structure is anthropologically interesting, being a matrilineal Muslim society with natolocal residence. A man will live in either his mother's or his wife's house. Remarriage for both men and women is accepted. Property is inalienable and owned by \\"houses\\" (matrilineal descent groups). As Muslims, they have conservative customs and traditions and yet they are liberal in approach. Here a man after marriage stays a member of his own mother's house throughout his life. Quite frequently Minicoy is referred to as the \\"female island\\" mentioned in the travelogue of Marco Polo. Thuraakunu in the Maldives is the closest island to Minicoy. Formerly there was direct trade between both, and fishermen from both islands used to visit each other. This exchange continued even after Minicoy became part of the Indian Union after independence. However, since 1956 the Indian government has forbidden these visits between two nations. The people of Maliku are known as good sailors, and also for boat building and other crafts. The Indian seafarers originated from Maliku island. =Status groups= The bodun owned land and bandu-odies (merchant ships); they were the vering (rulers). The niamin were pilots of the Bandu-odies and while on shore assisted the bodun in administrative and other leadership functions; they were custodians of property and supervised public work. The medhukimbin and the raaverin were working classes (the medhukimbin enjoying a status higher than the raaverin.) The raaverin tapped coconut palms for toddy, a distinctive beverage converted into sweet palm syrup. Coconut vinegar, known as raahuiiy, was also produced by the raaverin. =Customs= Each village of Maliku has a Bodukaaka (male mayor) and Bodudhatha (female mayor) who conduct village business at a gathering known as Baemedu. The Bodukaaka announces Baemedu by sending children of the village to each house. Male members gather in the village house to learn the purpose of the Baemedu. After the work is finished, there is a feast prepared by female members of the village. A newborn child is named on its day of birth (this is different from the Maldivian tradition of being named on the seventh day). The baby normally stays in the room in which it is born (which is customarily the ancestral home of the mother) for the first six days. The mother's house name becomes the child's surname. On the seventh day after birth, the baby is taken to the father's ancestral home, where jewellery is presented. After 20 days, the baby's head is shaven and the hair is weighed against something of value, traditionally gold or silver, which would be given to the poor. This ceremony is called boabeylun. Circumcision of boys is followed by much celebration. Dancing and drumming in the evening forms part of the entertainment. The festivities usually continue for about a week. =Religion= Minicoy islanders, like the other Lakshadweep islanders, follow Islam. Entry Under the Laccadive, Minicoy and Aminidivi Islands (Laws) Regulations, 1967 of the Government of India, the following people may enter Minicoy (Maliku): # Persons who had taken up permanent residence in Minicoy at any time before 1967 and members of the families of such persons. # Member of the Armed Forces of India entering Minicoy on duty. # Persons serving in connection with the administration of the Union Territory of Lakshadweep proceeding to Minicoy on official duty and members of their families. # Officials and non-officials sponsored by any of the Ministries or Departments of the Government of India or the Administrator of Lakshadweep. # Indian Tourists permitted by the Administrator of Lakshadweep. # Non-Indian nationals permitted by the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of India for visits for such periods as may be specified by the Ministry, or the Administrator of Lakshadweep. # Employees of the Indian federal and state governments, Indian public sector undertakings and bona fide domestic servants and cooks permitted by the Administrator of Lakshadweep. # Maldive nationals permitted by the High Commissioner of India to the Maldives to visit specifically Minicoy for the period not exceeding fifteen days. Such persons may not disembark on any other Lakshadweep island unless permitted as per point 6 above. The High Commissioner of India in Malé shall intimate the names of the persons whose visits are permitted and the period of their stay to the Administrator of Lakshadweep sufficiently in advance. The Administrator may, on valid grounds, extend the period of stay of Maldive nationals. Transport MV Corals, MV Lagoons, MV Amindivi, MV Arabian Sea, MV Bharat Seema, MV Dweep Setu, MV Kavaratti, MV Lakshadweep Sea and MV Minicoy are the important passenger ships connecting Lakshadweep with Kerala. The passage takes between 14 and 20 hours. Agatti Airport is the only civilian airport in Lakshadweep. Helicopter transfer is available from Agatti to Kavaratti throughout the year. The flight from Cochin to Agatti takes approximately one hour thirty minutes. Flights operate six days a week. The Government of India is planning to develop an airport at Minicoy Island to boost tourism and promote tuna fishing industry for improving livelihoods in Lakshadweep. The emergence of historic port city Vizhinjam (Trivandrum) to its ancient glorious state as one of the major cities in India had forced the Ports Department to dust off an old proposal to launch a passenger ship service between Trivandrum and Minicoy. The distance between Trivandrum and Minicoy is just 398 km. The Lakshadweep authorities are also seeking an opportunity to invest in Kollam Port. They are ready to invest in a passenger terminal with dormitory facilities and an office to guide the people of Minicoy reaching Kollam Port. Traditionally, Lakshadweep's connections with the mainland have been through Trivandrum, Kochi and Beypore ports. But Minicoy, a small atoll at the southernmost end of the archipelago, is closer to Kollam than to either Kochi or Beypore.

It is situated on the Avocet Line which runs between Exeter St Davids and Exmouth. History A station known as Woodbury Road opened with the railway on 1 May 1861; It was renamed Exton on 15 Sept 1958 and became Exton Halt on 28 February 1965 but has since lost the \\"halt\\" suffix in common with most similar stations. Its location on the banks of the River Exe was exploited for many years by placing a camping coach in the goods yard that could be hired by holidaymakers. Description The station has a single platform that serves trains in both directions (it is on the left of a train arriving from Exeter) and faces out across the estuary of the River Exe. The platform is much lower than usual in the United Kingdom which leads to a significant step up into the trains. This is difficult for the less mobile or for people with luggage, also while all trains carry wheelchair ramps, it is not possible to use them here. Requests to Railtrack and Network Rail to raise the platform have so far been unsuccessful. Services About half the trains on the Avocet Line from to and call at Exton on request. This means that passengers alighting here must tell the conductor that they wish to do so, and those waiting to join must signal clearly to the driver as the train approaches. Connections are available at for also and other stations to Waterloo; passengers for other main line stations change at St Davids.

Uses  Lithium acetate is used in the laboratory as buffer for gel electrophoresis of DNA and RNA. It has a lower electrical conductivity and can be run at higher speeds than can gels made from TAE buffer (5-30V/cm as compared to 5-10V/cm). At a given voltage, the heat generation and thus the gel temperature is much lower than with TAE buffers, therefore the voltage can be increased to speed up electrophoresis so that a gel run takes only a fraction of the usual time. Downstream applications, such as isolation of DNA from a gel slice or Southern blot analysis, work as expected when using lithium acetate gels. Lithium boric acid or sodium boric acid are usually preferable to lithium acetate or TAE when analyzing smaller fragments of DNA (less than 500 bp) due to the higher resolution of borate-based buffers in this size range as compared to acetate buffers. Lithium acetate is also used to permeabilize the cell wall of yeast for use in DNA transformation. It is believed that the beneficial effect of LiOAc is caused by its chaotropic effect; denaturing DNA, RNA and proteins.

Geosmin, along with the irregular monoterpene 2-methylisoborneol, together account for the majority of biologically-caused taste and odor outbreaks in drinking water worldwide. Geosmin has a distinct earthy or musty odor, which most people can easily smell. The odor detection threshold of geosmin is very low, ranging from 0.006 to 0.01 micrograms per liter in water. Geosmin is also responsible for the earthy taste of beetroots and a contributor to the strong scent (petrichor) that occurs in the air when rain falls after a dry spell of weather or when soil is disturbed. In chemical terms, it is a bicyclic alcohol with formula , a derivative of decalin. Its name is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"earth\\" and \\"smell\\". The word was coined in 1965 by the American biochemist Nancy N. Gerber (1929–1985) and the French-American biologist Hubert A. Lechevalier (1926–2015).  Production  Geosmin is produced by various blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and filamentous bacteria in the class Actinomyces, and also some other prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The main genera in the cyanobacteria that have been shown to produce geosmin include Anabaena, Phormidium, and Planktothrix, while the main genus in the Actinomyces that produces geosmin is Streptomyces. Communities whose water supplies depend on surface water can periodically experience episodes of unpleasant-tasting water when a sharp drop in the population of these bacteria releases geosmin into the local water supply. Under acidic conditions, geosmin decomposes into odorless substances. In 2006, the biosynthesis of geosmin by a bifunctional Streptomyces coelicolor enzyme was unveiled. A single enzyme, geosmin synthase, converts farnesyl diphosphate to geosmin in a two-step reaction. Not all blue-green algae cyanobacteria produce geosmin. Identification of species that might produce geosmin is traditionally done through microscopic identification of algae as geosmin producers, a technique that is labor-intensive and requires specialized knowledge. Recent advances in molecular biology have enabled identification of a geosmin synthase gene, geoA, which is present in cyanobacterial species that produce geosmin, but is not present in other cyanobacterial species . Amplification of this gene from water samples using real-time PCR may permit predictions of taste and odor events caused by cyanobacteria in fresh water. Streptomyces coelicolor is the model representative of a group of soil-dwelling bacteria with a complex lifecycle involving mycelial growth and spore formation. Besides the production of volatile geosmin, it also produces many other complex molecules of pharmacological interest; its genome sequence is available at the Sanger Institute.  Effects  The human nose is extremely sensitive to geosmin and is able to detect it at concentrations as low as 5 parts per trillion. Geosmin is responsible for the muddy smell in many commercially important freshwater fish such as carp and catfish. Geosmin combines with 2-methylisoborneol, which concentrates in the fatty skin and dark muscle tissues. It breaks down in acid conditions; hence, vinegar and other acidic ingredients are used in fish recipes to reduce the muddy flavor. Taste and odor compounds including geosmin lead to an unpleasant taste of drinking water which is perceived by consumers as an indication of poor water quality. This compound is also an issue for saltwater fish farmed in recirculating aquaculture systems, such as Atlantic salmon. These systems rely on biological filtration using cultured microbial communities to process the nitrogenous waste from the fish (ammonia) into less harmful compounds (nitrite and nitrate) that can be tolerated at higher concentrations. However, geosmin-producing bacteria can also grow in these systems, and often require fish to be transferred to an additional \\"finishing\\" or \\"purge\\" system where they are not fed for several days prior to harvest to remove off-flavor compounds and empty the intestinal tract. This process is also known as depuration.

History The original line-up of the band consisted of James Fry (vocals), Andrew Hobson (bass guitar), Gordon King (guitar), Tony Ogden (drums), Rory Conolly (saxophone), Nick Phillips (organ) and Andy Robbins (synthesiser). This version soon disintegrated, and some years later a new line-up emerged, this time based in Manchester. A short lived 1986 version of World of Twist featured Gordon King (vocalist and co-songwriter), Tony Ogden (co-songwriter), Andy Hobson (Bass, Keyboards), Neil Drabble (visuals). The 1989 version of World Of Twist featured Ogden (now vocalist and co-songwriter), King (guitar and co-songwriter), and Hobson (synthesisers) joined by Alan Frost (visual effects, synthesisers), Julia aka M.C. Shells (swirls and sea noises) and Angela Reilly (visual effects). Nick Sanderson (drums) joined some time later. A demo tape (featuring \\"The Storm\\", \\"Blackpool Tower Suite\\", \\"The Spring\\", and \\"She's a Rainbow\\") released in early 1990 drew attention to the band, and a recording contract with Circa Records followed. The record label issued the singles \\"The Storm\\" (produced by Clif Brigden) that same year with \\"Sons of the Stage\\" also (produced by Clif Brigden) and \\"Sweets\\" following in 1991. A cover of The Rolling Stones' \\"She's a Rainbow\\", originally issued as the B-side of \\"The Storm\\", was reissued with new dance mixes by Fluke in 1992. The original B-side version had been one of the last tracks produced by Martin Hannett, who died in 1991. The band's live show and Radio 1 sessions for John Peel and Mark Goodier, and the first two Clif Brigden produced singles raised expectations, but their debut album, Quality Street (1991), met with little critical or commercial acclaim. Whilst John Peel's Radio 1 show was broadcasting during the 1990 World Cup, a listener's letter was read out on air recalling that when a World Of Twist single was played during one of England's previous Cup games, England scored during the record's air-time. The letter pleaded for Peel to play it again if England needed a goal. 81 minutes into the game, Gary Lineker scored to level the game at 1-1. This forced extra time and a penalty shoot out. While World of Twist never toured in North America, \\"Sons of the Stage\\" was an indie/club hit in Toronto and New York. Oasis considered naming themselves after the song, and it was later covered by Oasis's successor group Beady Eye, as a B-side to their debut single, \\"Bring the Light\\". Work began on a follow up album and there were plans for further touring, but problems emerged when Ogden decided that he no longer wanted to sing. This, coupled with creative differences within the band, contributed to the demise of the group in 1992. Gordon King, James Fry and Nick Sanderson went on to form Earl Brutus in 1993 with Rob Marche (formerly of Joboxers and Subway Sect) and Stuart Boreman. King, Fry and Boreman would later form The Pre New in 2010. Anthony William Ogden died on 26 July 2006, in Bramhall, Greater Manchester, on the verge of a return to the music industry with Bubblegum Secret Pop Explosion. He was 44. Few details on his death have been released. Quality Street was reissued with bonus tracks on CD and heavyweight vinyl by British independent record label 3 Loop Music in 2013.

R. Martin. Description The game is designed to be usable with two RPG systems: the d20 System and the Tri-Stat dX system. Two editions were made: a serial- numbered edition limited to 2500 copies, ; and a standard edition, . The limited edition is faux-leather bound with silver gilt pages and includes rules for both systems, and includes an interview with Martin. The standard edition contains only the d20 system rules. The book was created by Guardians of Order and released by Sword & Sorcery, a subsidiary of White Wolf Games. Reception The A Game of Thrones RPG (AGOT RPG) was nominated for several ENnie Awards and won 2006 awards for: Best Production (Silver), Best Game (Silver), and Best d20/OGL Product (Silver). History On 28 July 2006, Martin announced that he had received word from the head of Guardians of Order that the company was folding and that no further releases for the setting would take place. Martin expressed hope that the game may be salvaged by another company, though he also said that he was experiencing difficulty in trying to recover his intellectual property rights. On 7 March 2007 Martin wrote that he had regained control of his intellectual property rights and was \\"all square\\" with Guardians of Order. As part of their settlement, Mr. Martin received all remaining stock of the limited edition version of the RPG. No further information regarding the settlement was revealed, nor the status of other creditors' claims on the property. On 24 April 2007, it was on Martin's website that Green Ronin was producing a new line of A Song of Ice and Fire RPG products, unrelated to the earlier Guardians of Order effort. The Green Ronin game, titled A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying (SIFRP), went on sale on 10 March 2009: it uses a custom game system and does not contain rules from either the d20 or Tri-Stat dX systems. Issue 307 of Dragon magazine featured D20 content related to ASOIAF, including stats for Tyrion Lannister, Sandor Clegane and other prominent characters; adventure hooks; and a brother of the Night's Watch prestige class.

The Caracazo, or sacudón, is the name given to the wave of protests, riots, looting, shootings and massacres. that started on 27 February 1989 in Guarenas, spreading to Caracas and surrounding towns. The weeklong clashes resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, thousands by some accounts, mostly at the hands of security forces and the military.UN, Venezuela: Wound Still Gaping 20 Years after ‘Caracazo’, By Humberto Márquez, Caracas, Feb 27 2009 (IPS), http://www.ipsnews.net/2009/02/venezuela-wound-still- gaping-20-years-after-lsquocaracazorsquo/Amnesty International, March 1990, Reports of Arbitrary Killings and Torture:, February/March 1989, AI Index: AMR 53/02/90, https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr53/002/1991/en/ The riots and the protests began mainly in response to the government's economic reforms and the resulting increase in the price of gasoline and transportation. Etymology The term, “Caracazo,” stems from the city’s name, Caracas, and “-azo,” which stems from another historic event, the Bogotazo, was a massive riot in Bogotá, recognized as having a crucial role in Colombia’s history.Minster, Christopher. “Colombia's Legendary Riot of 1948.” ThoughtCo, ThoughtCo, 24 July 2019, www.thoughtco.com/the-bogotazo-april-9-1948-2136619. “Caracazo” is technically defined as the “Caracas smash” or “the big one in Caracas” based on Spanish dialect. Background A fall in oil prices in the mid-1980s caused an economic crisis to take hold in Venezuela, and the country had accrued significant levels of debt. Nevertheless, the administration of the left-leaning President Jaime Lusinchi was able to restructure the country's debt repayments and offset an economic crisis but allow for the continuation of the government's policies of social spending and state- sponsored subsidies.Barcelona Centre for International Affairs, Jaime Lusinchi, (Spanish) http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/venezuela/jaime_lusinchi#2 Lusinchi's political party, the Democratic Action, was able to remain in power following the 1988 election of Carlos Andrés Pérez as president. Pérez received 53% of the vote, while the others gained at least 40%. Pérez then proposed a major shift in policy by implementing economic reforms recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The program, called El Gran Viraje (The Great Turn), but popularly known as the paquete (the \\"package\\"), was contrary to statements made during Pérez's populist campaign in which he had described the IMF as \\"a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing.\\"Carlos Andrés Pérez, Obituary, Time Magazine, Jan. 10 2011 Measures taken by Pérez included privatizing state companies, tax reform, reducing customs duties, and diminishing the role of the state in the economy. He also took measures to decentralize and modernize the Venezuelan political system by the direct election of state governors, who had previously been appointed by the president. The most controversial part of the economic reform package was the reduction of the gasoline subsidies, which had long maintained domestic gasoline prices far beneath international levels and even the production costs. On the weekend of 25–26 February 1989, gasoline prices rose 100 per cent, as had been laid out in the economic adjustment program announced by the government on February 16. The fuel price increase in turn necessitated an increase in public transportation fares of 30 per cent officially, and more in practice as some carriers refused to limit their prices to the official rate.Margarita López Maya, 2003. \\"The Venezuelan Caracazo of 1989: Popular Protest and Institutional Weakness\\", Journal of Latin American Studies, Vol.35, No.1 (2003), pp 120-121 (See #Further reading). According to retired Venezuelan General Carlos Julio Peñaloza Zambrano, Cuban agents might have entered Venezuela during Carlos Andrés Pérez's inauguration ceremony, which was attended by Fidel Castro, and may have waited for unrest to occur in Venezuela so they could exacerbate political tensions. Protests and rioting Looters running through the streets with stolen goods The protests and rioting began on the morning of 27 February 1989 in Guarenas, a town in Miranda State about east of Caracas, due to the increase in public transportation prices.El Caracazo Case, Judgment of 11 November 1999, Inter- American Court of Human Rights, accessed 1 May 2007 The protests and rioting quickly spread to the capital and other towns across the country. A lack of timely intervention by authorities –some police were under orders not to take action– led the Metropolitan Police to be quickly overwhelmed. The protests spread to Caracas, whose Metropolitan Police was on a labour strike. Despite initial debate within the government over how to manage the situation, a heavy-handed approach was implemented as a state of emergency and martial law were imposed. On February 28, Pérez suspended a number of articles of the Constitution, including Article 60 (right to individual liberty and security), Article 62 (inviolability of the home), Article 66 (freedom of expression), Article 71 (right to gather publicly and privately), and Article 115 (right to peaceful protest).Crisp, Brian F. (1998), \\"Presidential Decree Authority in Venezuela\\", in John M. Carey and Matthew Soberg Shugart (eds, 1998), Executive decree authority, Cambridge University Press. p150 The rights were not completely restored until March 22, and in the interim, there was no official decree or resolution to define how government authority would be exercised in the absence of those constitutional rights. Smoke billowing from fires throughout Caracas Large crowds of people gather during the rioting By the time authorities encountered the scenes of rioting, citizens began firing weapons at officers, with the ensuing firefights resulting in many bystanders being killed by \\"bullets from army troops and from sniping protesters.\\" In many poor areas, citizens destroyed their own local commercial facilities, with food markets so damaged that their food distribution system was ruined. Much of the rioters destroyed properties indiscriminately, with no motives related to initial protests. According to Amnesty International, tactics used by security forces included \\"disappearances,\\" the use of torture, and extrajudicial killings. As part of the government's security forces, members of Hugo Chávez's MBR-200 allegedly participated in the crackdown. Chávez himself was sick that day with measles. As tensions eased, troops began to sweep through neighborhoods collecting appliances and cash registers and informing citizens that if they provided a certificate of purchase, the items would be returned. The initial official pronouncements stated that 276 people had died but many estimates put the number at above 2,000.Crisp, Brian F. (1998), \\"Presidential Decree Authority in Venezuela\\", in John M. Carey and Matthew Soberg Shugart (eds, 1998), Executive decree authority, Cambridge University Press. p157 Shortages of coffins were reported and many Venezuelans had to line up at government food distribution centers since markets were destroyed by rioters. Insurance estimates of damage caused during the rioting were $90 million USD ($120 million CAD). Aftermath and consequences On March 3, 1989, President Carlos Andres Pérez spoke with U.S. President George H. W. Bush. President Bush offered Pérez a US$450 million emergency loan. Pérez thanked Bush and asked him to support a change in debt policy toward Latin America: \\"I want to tell you if there is no change in [international] debt policy then whatever we may do here may be useless.\\" Pérez told Bush that he had sent him a letter several days earlier and that he would appreciate it if he would read it.Bush Presidential Library, 3 March 1989, Memcons and Telcons, https://bush41library.tamu.edu/files/Press-- Meetings%20with%20Foreigners%201989.pdf Pérez also visited Bush in Washington on April 1, 1989.\\"Meetings with Foreign Leaders\\" (Bush Library) =Political instability= The clearest consequence of the Caracazo was political instability. The following February, the army was called to contain similar riots in Puerto La Cruz and Barcelona and again in June, when rising of transportation costs ended in riots in Maracaibo and other cities. The reforms were modified. The MBR-200 repudiated the Caracazo and accelerated its preparation for a coup d'état against the Perez government. In 1992, there were two attempted coups in February and November. Pérez was later accused of corruption and removed from the presidency. Chávez, a MBR-200 leader and an organiser of one of the coups, was found guilty of sedition and incarcerated. However, he was subsequently pardoned by Pérez's successor, Rafael Caldera, and he went on to be elected president after the latter. Chavez later explained that after the event, \\"the members of the MBR 200 realized we had passed the point of no return and we had to take up arms. We could not continue to defend a murderous regime.\\" =Investigations= Military response to the rioting. In 1998, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights condemned the government's action and referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. In 1999, the Court heard the case and found that the government had committed violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings. The Venezuelan government, by then headed by Chávez, did not contest the findings of the case and accepted full responsibility for the government's actions. In August 2009, Defense Minister Italo del Valle Alliegro was charged in relation to the Caracazo.BBC, 18 July 2009, Former Venezuela minister charged In July 2010, the Supreme Court overturned an appeal court ruling, which had declared the case covered by a statute of limitations.Latin American Herald Tribune, 2 August 2010, Venezuela’s Ex-Defense Chief May Face Charges for ‘89 Repression See also *Bogotazo *Cordobazo *Rosariazo *Dakazo *El Caracazo *List of massacres in Venezuela Further reading * Margarita López Maya, \\"The Venezuelan Caracazo of 1989: Popular Protest and Institutional Weakness\\", Journal of Latin American Studies, Vol.35, No.1 (2003) pp. 117–37 * \\"The President's Telephone Conversation with President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela on March 3, 1989.\\" George H.W.

They are noted for their docile nature, and gentle disposition.National Jersey Wooly Rabbit Club http://www.njwrc.net/  Origins  Bonnie Seeley of High Bridge, New Jersey, introduced the Jersey Wooly at the 1984 American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) Convention in Orlando, Florida. It was recognized by the ARBA in 1988. Today, the Jersey Wooly is one of the most widely- exhibited rabbits at local and national shows in the United States. They are also renowned as highly docile pets. The Jersey Wooly was developed by crossing the Netherland Dwarf and the French Angora. The result of this cross was a petite rabbit with a wool coat. Early Jersey Woolies still maintained the oblong body shape of the French Angora, made smaller by the influence of the dwarfing gene.  Appearance and personality  A full grown Jersey Wooly weighs 1 - 1.5 kg (2.5 - 3.5 pounds) with 3 lbs being considered ideal.Jersey Wooly Rabbit Information and History, Retrieved November 8, 2013 They have a compact body type. The ears are small and erect, standing about 2 inches long. 3 inch ears are the maximum length allowed for exhibition stock per the ARBA's Standard of Perfection. When showing a Jersey Wooly, people must know that the head and ears have the most points. The head is bold and squarish which led the breed to being affectionately referred to as the \\"Mug Head.\\" These rabbits are very affectionate and playful and most Jersey Woolys have very friendly personalities. As pets, they range from laid-back lap bunnies to outgoing explorers.  Lifespan  The average life span of a Jersey Wooly can depend on many factors, including genetics and care. It is not uncommon for a Jersey Wooly to live 7-10+ years when properly cared for. There is a common myth that those who have had litters die sooner, but this has not been scientifically proven. Many rabbit breeders have healthy Jersey Woolys who have had multiple litters live just as long as pet Jersey Woolys who have never had babies. It is also believed that neutering and spaying these rabbits will add years to their life span. Without neutering or spaying, rabbits can develop cancer and tumors that are life-threatening.

In Japan it is used as food preservative. Characteristics Its flowers have a porcelain look, are shell-like and bloom prolifically on a 30-cm stalk. The flower's single fertile stamen has a massive anther. The globose white stigma of the pistil extends beyond the tip of the anther. The foliage of Alpinia nutans is evergreen in areas that do not have a hard freeze. It has a very distinctive cardamom fragrance when brushed or rubbed, but this is not the plant that produces the spice by that name. Chemistry The rhizome oil of Alpinia speciosa contains some fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms, which are less common in nature than fatty acids with even numbers of carbon atoms. The major one is pentadecanoic acid (C-15, 21.9%) and others are tricosylic acid (C-23, 5.7%), tridecylic acid (C-13, 1.9%), undecylic acid (C-11, 3.1%) and pelargonic acid (C-9, 0.1%). Among the fatty acids containing even number of carbon atoms, the main constituents are linolenic acid (C-18:3, 27.4%) and arachidic acid (C-20, 22.4%). The total saturated fatty acids constitute 65.7% and unsaturated 34.3%. Spectroscopic analysis revealed two new compounds of glucoside esters of ferulic acid. It also contains dihydro-5,6-dehydrokawain. Medicinal uses Alpinia nutans is used in traditional medicine as diuretic, antihypertensive, antifungal, and antiulcer. The plant extract was experimentally shown to induce dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure in rats and dogs. However, it was found to have no effect on diuresis. Two new glucoside esters of ferulic acid isolated from the rhizome have higher antioxidant activity than Trolox. Its chemical compound dihydro-5,6-dehydrokawain has an inhibitory effect on lipid peroxide, and has an activity similar to that of beta-carotene.

Properties Alpha Sagittarii is a blue, class B dwarf star. It does not appear particularly bright in the sky to the naked eye, with a visual apparent magnitude of +3.97. However, this is due to its distance; in reality, the star is more than double the effective temperature of the Sun and nearly three times as massive, with a luminosity in visible wavelengths about 117 times greater than that of the Sun. Based on an excess emission of infrared radiation, it may have a debris disk, much like Vega. This is a single-lined spectroscopic binary system. The ROSAT All Sky Survey discovered that Alpha Sagittarii is emitting an excess flux of X-rays, which is not expected to originate from a star of this spectral class. The most likely explanation is that the companion is an active pre-main sequence star or else a star that has just reached the main sequence. Nomenclature α Sagittarii (Latinised to Alpha Sagittarii) is the star's Bayer designation. It is unclear why Bayer designated this star as the alpha, rather than Epsilon Sagittarii or Sigma Sagittarii. This led some old star charts to occasionally depict Alpha and Beta Sagittarii as much brighter than they are in reality, as they are invisible from northern Europe, being too far south to see there. The star bore the traditional names Rukbat and Alrami, derived from the Arabic rukbat al-rāmī 'the knee of the archer'. The star Delta Cassiopeiae also bore the traditional names Ruchbah or Rukbat, from the Arabic word ركبة rukbah meaning \\"knee\\".

They can grow up to tall and bear colorful funnel- shaped flowers. They are grown as ornamentals and their leaves are used in cuisine and traditional medicine. They are also sometimes known as the pink porcelain lily, variegated ginger or butterfly ginger.  Characteristics  Native to eastern Asia, this plant is a rhizomatous, evergreen tropical perennial that grows in upright clumps tall in tropical climates. It bears funnel-formed flowers. Flowers have white or pink perianths with yellow labella with red spots and stripes. There are three stamens, but only one has pollen. There is one pistil. The fruit is globose with many striations. In more typical conditions, it reaches feet tall in the green house, and feet tall, as a house plant. It was originally called Alpinia speciosa, which was also the scientific name of torch ginger. To avoid the confusion, it was renamed as A. zerumbet while torch ginger was reclassified in the genus Etlingera, no specie is called A. speciosa. Alpinia zerumbet Cultivation Alpinia zerumbet is best grown in rich medium-wet, to wet well drained soils in full sun to part shade. Afternoon shade in hot summer climates, is recommended. Indoors, the plant must have bright light and humid conditions. Flowering rarely occurs before the second year. Alpinia zerumbet is called a \\"shell ginger\\" or \\"shell flower\\" most commonly, because its individual pink flowers, especially when in bud, resemble sea shells. Other common names in English include \\"pink porcelain lily\\", \\"variegated ginger, \\"butterfly ginger\\", and \\"light galangal\\". In Japanese it is known as gettō' (ゲットウ). In Okinawan, it is known as sannin. In Chinese, it is known as yàn shānjiāng (艳山姜) or yuetao (月桃). Uses The plant's long leaf blades are used for wrapping zongzi, a traditional Chinese dish made of rice stuffed with different fillings. In Okinawa, Japan, A. zerumbet is known in the local dialect as sannin, or in Japanese as getto. Its leaves are sold for making an herbal tea and are also used to flavor noodles and wrap mochi rice cakes. Statistically, Okinawan natives who consume a traditional diet that includes shell ginger have a very long life expectancy. Recent research has investigated its effects on human longevity and the phytochemicals that may be responsible. There have also been investigations into its antioxidant and hypotensive properties which may be responsible for its effectiveness in traditional medicine.

He was a member of a famous noble Venetian family (the Morosini family) which produced several Doges and generals.Encyclopædia Britannica, Morosini Family, 2008, O.Ed. He \\"dressed always in red from top to toe and never went into action without his cat beside him.\\" Jan Morris. The Venetian Empire: A Sea Voyage. (Kindle Locations 976-977). Penguin Books Ltd. Kindle Edition. Early career Morosini first rose to prominence as Captain-General of the Venetian forces on Crete during the siege of Candia by the Ottoman Empire. He was eventually forced to surrender the city, and was accused of cowardice and treason on his return to Venice; however, he was acquitted after a brief trial. In 1685, at the outbreak of the Morean War, Morosini took command of a fleet against the Ottomans. Over the next several years, he captured the Morea with the help of Otto Wilhelm Königsmarck, as well as Lefkada and parts of western Greece. He also briefly captured Athens but was unable to hold it, and attempted a failed siege of the former Venetian fortress of Negroponte. His fame reached such heights that he was given the victory title Peloponnesiacus, and was the first Venetian citizen to have a bronze bust placed during his own lifetime in the Great Hall, with the inscription Francisco Morosini Peloponnesiaco, adhuc vivendi, Senatus. Destruction of the Parthenon and loot of sculptures from Athens During the siege of Athens in 1687 at the Morean War, his artillery turned the Parthenon from a functioning building to a simple ruin, and he personally oversaw the looting of some of the surviving sculptures. The Parthenon was used as a powder magazine by the Ottomans when on September 26, 1687, Morosini's cannon scored a direct hit on the edifice. An attaché of the Swedish field commander General Otto Wilhelm Königsmarck wrote later: \\"How it dismayed His Excellency to destroy the beautiful temple which had existed three thousand years!\\". By contrast Morosini, who was the commander in chief of the operation, described it in his report to the Venetian government as a \\"fortunate shot\\". When he conquered Acropolis in early 1688, Morosini tried to loot Athena's and Poseidon's horses and chariots from the west pediment of the Parthenon but the sculptures fell on the ground and smashed. This was the first documented attempt to remove sculptures from the pediments. The Ottoman Empire regained possession of the monument in the following year and having noticed the demand began to sell souvenirs to Westerners.Encyclopædia Britannica, Athens, The Acropolis, p.6/20, 2008, O.Ed. Morosini also looted from the port of Piraeus the famous Piraeus Lion which is on display at the Venetian Arsenal. Doge In the summer of 1688, Morosini, now having been proclaimed Doge of Venice, attacked Negropont but was unable to capture it and was forced to return to Venice when plague broke out among his troops. He embarked on a final campaign in 1693, but was again unsuccessful in taking Negropont, and returned to Venice after sacking some minor coastal towns.

The virus (EIAV) is endemic in the Americas, parts of Europe, the Middle and Far East, Russia, and South Africa. The virus is a lentivirus, like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Like HIV, EIA can be transmitted through blood, milk, and body secretions. Transmission is primarily through biting flies, such as the horse-fly and deer-fly. The virus survives up to 4 hours in the vector. Contaminated surgical equipment and recycled needles and syringes, and bitsEquine Infectious Anemia (EIA) , North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, retrieved December 19, 2008. can transmit the disease. Mares can transmit the disease to their foals via the placenta. The risk of transmitting the disease is greatest when an infected horse is ill, as the blood levels of the virus are then highest. Stages Acute: The acute form is a sudden onset of the disease at full-force. Symptoms include high fever, anemia (due to the breakdown of red blood cells), weakness, swelling of the lower abdomen and legs, weak pulse, and irregular heartbeat. The horse may die suddenly. Subacute: A slower, less severe progression of the disease. Symptoms include recurrent fever, weight loss, an enlarged spleen (felt during a rectal examination), anemia, and swelling of the lower chest, abdominal wall, penile sheath, scrotum, and legs. Chronic: The horse tires easily and is unsuitable for work. The horse may have a recurrent fever and anemia, and may relapse to the subacute or acute form even several years after the original attack. A horse may also not appear to have any symptoms, yet still tests positive for EIA antibodies. Such a horse can still pass on the disease. According to most veterinarians, horses diagnosed EIA positive usually do not show any sign of sickness or disease. EIA may cause abortion in pregnant mares. This may occur at any time during the pregnancy if there is a relapse when the virus enters the blood. Most infected mares will abort, however some give birth to healthy foals. Foals are not necessarily infected. Studies indicate that there are breeds with a tolerance to EIA.\\"Agricultural Biological Diversity\\", Convention on Biological Diversity, referenced August 12, 2008. Recent studies in Brazil on living wild horses have shown that in the Pantanal, about 30% of domesticated and about 5.5% of the wild horses are chronically infected with EIA. Prevention and treatment A vaccine is available, called \\"Chinese Live Attenuated EIA vaccine\\", developed in China and widely used there since 1983. Another attenuated live virus vaccine is in development in the United States. Reuse of syringes and needles is a risk factor for transfer of the disease. Currently in the United States, all horses that test positive must be reported to federal authorities by the testing laboratory. EIA-positive horses are infected for life. Options for the horse include sending the horse to a recognized research facility, branding the horse and quarantining it at least 200 yards from other horses for the rest of its life, and euthanizing the horse. Very few quarantine facilities exist, which usually leads to the option of euthanizing the horse. The Florida Research Institute for Equine Nurturing, Development and Safety (a.k.a. F.R.I.E.N.D.S.) is one of the largest such quarantine facilities and is located in south Florida. The horse industry and the veterinary industry strongly suggest that the risks posed by infected horses, even if they are not showing any clinical signs, are enough of a reason to impose such stringent rules. The precise impacts of the disease on the horse industry are unknown. Diagnosis The Coggins test submission form, which requires identification of the horse's physical appearance. The Coggins test (agar immunodiffusion) is a sensitive diagnostic test for equine infectious anemia developed by Dr. Leroy Coggins in the 1970s. Currently, the US does not have an eradication program due to the low rate of incidence. However, many states require a negative Coggins test for interstate travel. In addition, most horse shows and events require a negative Coggins test. Most countries require a negative test result before allowing an imported horse into the country. Horse owners should verify that all the horses at a breeding farm and or boarding facility have a negative Coggins test before using the services of the facility. A Coggins test should be done on an annual basis. Tests every 6 months are recommended if there is increased traveling.

Part of a nudist beach The Donauinsel (Danube Island) is a long, narrow island in central Vienna, Austria, lying between the Danube river and the parallel excavated channel Neue Donau (\\"New Danube\\"). The island is in length, but is only wide.Flood control on the Danube – Facts and figures The New Danube waterway is practically an elongated (swimming) lake, technically a diluvian bed. Donautech Data Sheet (see below: References). It has been described as an \\"autobahn for swimmers\\", due to its use by people commuting to work. Recreation and festival venue To most visitors, the island is known as a recreational area with bars, restaurants and nightclubs. It has sports opportunities from rollerblading, cycling and swimming to canoeing. There is one beach that, in its beginning, felt so exotic that it was soon nicknamed the \\"Copa Cagrana\\" as a humoristic allusion to Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana: Kagran is the part of the 22nd District of Vienna next to that beach. In the southern and northern parts of the island, there are extensive (and free) nude beaches. The Donauinselfest is an internationally well-known annual open air festival, and Europe's biggest event of this kind, with over 3 million visitors. It takes place at the end of June (Friday through Sunday) - except for 2008 (September 5-7), due to Austria (and Switzerland) hosting the European Football Championship. On September 23, 2008, Madonna gave her first concert in Austria there in front of a crowd of 57,000. Reliable flood protection The main purpose of the island however is to be part of Vienna's highly sophisticated flood protection system. As the river Danube crosses the city (before major extensions: passed nearby), this has been a constant concern over hundreds of years. The first notable protective measures were taken between 1870 and 1875. A central bed, 280 m, was dug out, and an inundation area of 450 m was created at the river's left bank. In 1970, a new plan was conceived and soon executed: digging an additional channel to replace the former inundation area, and using the spoil to build up the remaining strip of land between the straightened bed from the 19th century flood defense schemes and the newly created one. The new channel is called the Neue Donau (New Danube). After the completion of the works it was envisaged that the resulting island should eventually be used for recreation. The flood control system is designed to protect from flash floods bringing river flows of up to 14,000 m3 per second. This has only happened once in Vienna's history; in 1501. The heavy 2002 flood brought flows of 10,000 m3 per second. It includes the Danube Canal's historic Nußdorf watergate, locks at either end of New Danube, a groundwater level control system integrated into the right bank flood levee (which creates appropriate conditions for the large park area Prater, once part of a wide alluvial forest zone), and the new Freudenau river plant's sluice.

It is an alternative to internal fixation, where the components used to provide stability are positioned entirely within the patient's body. It is used to stabilize bone and soft tissues at a distance from the operative or injury focus. They provide unobstructed access to the relevant skeletal and soft tissue structures for their initial assessment and also for secondary interventions needed to restore bony continuity and a functional soft tissue cover. Surgical pins exiting the skin Indications # Stabilization of severe open fractures # Stabilization of infected nonunions # Correction of extremity malalignments and length discrepancies # Initial stabilization of soft tissue and bony disruption in poly trauma patients (damage control orthopaedics) # Closed fracture with associated severe soft tissue injuries # Severely comminuted diaphyseal and periarticular lesions # Temporary transarticular stabilization of severe soft tissue and ligamentous injuries # Pelvic ring disruptions # Certain pediatric fractures # Arthrodesis # Ligamentotaxis # Osteotomies # Open fractures that have significant soft tissue disruption (e.g., type II or III open fractures) # Soft tissue injury (e.g., burns) # Acetabular and pelvic fractures # Severely comminuted and unstable fractures # Fractures that are associated with bony deficits # Limb- lengthening procedures # Fractures associated with infection or nonunion External fixation of the mandible. Contraindications # Patient with compromised immune system # Non compliant patient who would not be able to ensure proper wire and pin care # Pre-existing internal fixation that prohibits proper wire or pin placement # Bone pathology precluding pin fixation Method In this kind of reduction, holes are drilled into uninjured areas of bones around the fracture and special bolts or wires are screwed into the holes. Outside the body, a rod or a curved piece of metal with special ball-and-socket joints joins the bolts to make a rigid support. The fracture can be set in the proper anatomical configuration by adjusting the ball-and-socket joints. Since the bolts pierce the skin, proper cleaning to prevent infection at the site of surgery must be performed. Installation of the external fixator is performed in an operating room, normally under general anesthesia. Removal of the external frame and bolts usually requires special wrenches and can be done with no anesthesia in an office visit. External fixation is usually used when internal fixation is contraindicated- often to treat open fractures, or as a temporary solution. External fixation is also used in limb lengthening. Typically, the bone is cut diagonally in a surgical procedure. External fixator pins or wires are placed on each side of the split and the external metal apparatus is used to very gradually pull the two sides of the bone apart over a long period of time. Bone will gradually grow into the small gap through distraction osteogenesis. In most cases it may be necessary for the external fixator to be in place for many weeks or even months. Most fractures heal in between 6 and 12 weeks. However, in complicated fractures and where there are problems with the healing of the fracture this may take longer. It is known that bearing weight through fracture by walking on it, for example, with the added support of the external fixator frame actually helps fractures to heal. The parts of an external fixator include: # Schanz pin # Connecting rods # Clamps Complications There is lack of evidence on best method of pinsite dressing to prevent surgical site infections. History an X-ray image of an external fixator being used for reduction of a broken bone, in this case, a Colles' fracture which involves a fractured radius bone. Almost 2,400 years ago Hippocrates described a form of external fixation to splint a fracture of the tibia. The device consisted of closely fitting proximal and distal Egyptian leather rings connected by four wooden rods from a cornel tree. In 1840, Jean-Francois Malgaigne described a spike driven into the tibia and held by straps to immobilise a fractured tibia. In 1843 he used a claw-like device to percutaneously hold the fragments of a fractured patella. Clayton Parkhill of Denver, Colorado and Albine Lambotte of Antwerp, Belgium independently invented the modern concept of unilateral external fixation, in 1894 and 1902, respectively. Lambotte was the first to use threaded pins, however, his device necessitated initial, open fracture reduction and then pin insertion and fixator placement. In 1938, Raoul Hoffmann of Geneva, Switzerland, building on the work of others, realized that major improvements were essential to make the external fixator more clinically relevant. He developed a technique based on closed reduction with guided percutaneous pin placement. Hoffmann’s technique exemplified the first application of minimally invasive orthopaedic surgery. In the 1950s, Gavriil Ilizarov of Kurgan, Soviet Union, devised and developed a new method for treating fractures, deformities and other bone defects. A metal frame that encircles the limb is attached to the underlying bone by crossing (X) pins inserted through the bone and limb. The external rings are linked to each other by threaded rods and hinges that allow to move the position of the bone fragments without opening the fracture site, then the fragments can be fixed in rigid position until complete healing.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Pogoni, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior The municipal unit has an area of 56.693 km2, the community 18.830 km2. The municipal unit consists of 4 villages: Pogoniani, Dolo, Drymades, Stavroskiadi. History In antiquity the area of Pogoniani was inhabited by Molossians, one of the three main Ancient Greek tribes of the northwestern Greek group. The establishment of the bishopric of Pogoniani is associated with the reign of Byzantine Emperor Constantine Pogonatos () due to the latter's nickname, but it first appears in the Notitiae Episcopatuum during the reign of Andronikos III Palaiologos (). The seat of the archbishop was most likely in Depalitsa (modern Molyvdoskepastos). Pogoniani fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1447. The three-aisled Orthodox basilica of Pogoniani was erected in 1873, with donations by the local Zosimas brothers benefactors. In the late Ottoman period and until 1923, the village of Pogoniani (known as Vostina) was inhabited by Muslim Albanians alongside Orthodox Greek inhabitants.Sarah Green (2005). Notes from the Balkans: Locating Marginality and Ambiguity on the Greek-Albanian border. Princeton University Press. pp. 56-57. Until 1924, Muslim Albanians from the village of Pogoniani used to have close relations and exchanges with people from the town of Libohovë in Albania.Gilles de Rapper & Pierre Sintès (2008). \\"Faire et Defaire les Frontieres du Mariage - Échanges matrimoniaux entre la Grèce et l’Albanie -le cas de la région de Gjirokastër\\". p. 4. \\"Dans ce modèle, la frontière internationale n’est pas un obstacle, tant qu’elle est ouverte au passage, parce qu’elle ne correspond pas aux lignes de partage locales : Grecs et Albanais, chrétiens et musulmans, peuvent se marier de part et d’autre de la frontière, à l’intérieur de leur groupe. C’est le cas entre les deux parties du Pogon jusqu’à la fermeture de la frontière en 1944 ; entre les musulmans de Libohovë et ceux de Voshtinë/Pogonniani jusqu’à l’expulsion de ces derniers en 1924 ; entre les Grecs du Haut Dropull et ceux de la Mourgana jusqu’en 1944 (Dino 2007, 18), entre ceux de Konispol et ceux de Filiates. Lorsque la frontière devient infranchissabl e et lorsque l’autre côté est considéré comme « ennemi », comme ce fut le cas à partir de 1944, les échanges matrimoniaux transfrontaliers disparaissent et laissent la place à d’autres alliances, qui semblaient jusqu’alors impossibles ou qui ne semblaient apporter aucun « avantage » : mariages entre minoritaires grecs et Albanais majoritaires, entre musulmans et chrétiens, entre gens des villages et gens des villes.\\" During the period prior to the First World War the British member of the International Commission that was responsible of the delineation of the Greek-Albanian border noticed that the villages that were ceded to Albania, which consist of the northern portion of Pogoniani are entirely Greek- speaking.British documents on the origins of the war, 1898-1914 ,.

(2008). . Sheffield, UK: Sero Consulting. p. 51. Retrieved on 21 January 2009. \\"... a Library Management System (LMS or ILS 'Integrated Library System' in US parlance).\\" Some useful library automation software are: KOHA ,Greenstone ,Libsys, and granthlaya.''' is an enterprise resource planning system for a library, used to track items owned, orders made, bills paid, and patrons who have borrowed. An ILS usually comprises a relational database, software to interact with that database, and two graphical user interfaces (one for patrons, one for staff). Most ILSes separate software functions into discrete programs called modules, each of them integrated with a unified interface. Examples of modules might include: * acquisitions (ordering, receiving, and invoicing materials) * cataloging (classifying and indexing materials) * circulation (lending materials to patrons and receiving them back) * serials (tracking magazine, journals, and newspaper holdings) * online public access catalog or OPAC (public user interface) Each patron and item has a unique ID in the database that allows the ILS to track its activity. HistoryPre-computerization= Prior to computerization, library tasks were performed manually and independently from one another. Selectors ordered materials with ordering slips, cataloguers manually catalogued sources and indexed them with the card catalog system (in which all bibliographic data was kept on a single index card), fines were collected by local bailiffs, and users signed books out manually, indicating their name on clue cards which were then kept at the circulation desk. Early mechanization came in 1936, when the University of Texas began using a punch card system to manage library circulation. While the punch card system allowed for more efficient tracking of loans, library services were far from being integrated, and no other library task was affected by this change. =1960s: the influence of computer technologies= The next big innovation came with the advent of MARC standards in the 1960s, which coincided with the growth of computer technologies – library automation was born. From this point onwards, libraries began experimenting with computers, and, starting in the late 1960s and continuing into the 1970s, bibliographic services utilizing new online technology and the shared MARC vocabulary entered the market; these included OCLC (1967), Research Libraries Group (which has since merged with OCLC), and the Washington Library Network (which became Western Library Network and is also now part of OCLC). =1970s–1980s: the early integrated library system= Dynix menu The 1970s can be characterized by improvements in computer storage, as well as in telecommunications. As a result of these advances, ‘turnkey systems on microcomputers,’ known more commonly as integrated library management systems (ILS) finally appeared. These systems included necessary hardware and software which allowed the connection of major circulation tasks, including circulation control and overdue notices. As the technology developed, other library tasks could be accomplished through ILS as well, including acquisition, cataloguing, reservation of titles, and monitoring of serials. =1990s–2000s: the growth of the Internet= With the evolution of the Internet throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, ILSs began allowing users to more actively engage with their libraries through an OPACs and online web-based portals. Users could log into their library accounts to reserve or renew books, as well as authenticate themselves for access to library- subscribed online databases. Inevitably, during this time, the ILS market grew exponentially. By 2002, the ILS industry averaged sales of approximately US$500 million annually, compared to just US$50 million in 1982. =Mid 2000s–present: increasing costs and customer dissatisfaction= By the mid to late 2000s, ILS vendors had increased not only the number of services offered but also their prices, leading to some dissatisfaction among many smaller libraries. At the same time, open source ILS was in its early stages of testing. Some libraries began turning to such open source ILSs as Koha and Evergreen. Common reasons noted were to avoid vendor lock in, avoid license fees, and participate in software development. Freedom from vendors also allowed libraries to prioritize needs according to urgency, as opposed to what their vendor can offer. Libraries which have moved to open source ILS have found that vendors are now more likely to provide quality service in order to continue a partnership since they no longer have the power of owning the ILS software and tying down libraries to strict contracts. This has been the case with the SCLENDS consortium. Following the success of Evergreen for the Georgia PINES library consortium, the South Carolina State Library along with some local public libraries formed the SCLENDS consortium in order to share resources and to take advantage of the open source nature of the Evergreen ILS to meet their specific needs. By October 2011, just 2 years after SCLENDS began operations, 13 public library systems across 15 counties had already joined the consortium, in addition to the South Carolina State Library.

Many modern cloud-based solutions allow automated cataloging by scanning a book's ISBN. Software criteriaDistributed software vs. web service= Library computer systems tend to fall into two categories of software: * that purchased on a perpetual license * that purchased as a subscription service (Software as a service). With distributed software the customer can choose to self-install or to have the system installed by the vendor on their own hardware. The customer can be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the application and the data, or the customer can choose to be supported by the vendor with an annual maintenance contract. Some vendors charge for upgrades to the software. Customers who subscribe to a web (hosted) service upload data to the vendor's remote server through the Internet and may pay a periodic fee to access their data. =Data entry assistance based on ISBN= Many applications can reduce a major portion of manual data entry by populating data fields based upon the entered ISBN using MARC standards technology via the Internet. = Bar code scanning and printing= With most software, users can eliminate some manual entry by using a bar-code scanner. Some software is designed, or can be extended with an additional module, to integrate scanner functionality. Most software vendors provide some type of scanner integration, and some print bar-code labels.  QR code scanning  A QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) first designed in 1994 for the automotive industry in Japan. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used.The QR code system was invented in 1994 by Masahiro Hara from the Japanese company Denso Wave.

In 2005, he was nominated for an Emmy Award for Exceptional Merit in Nonfiction Filmmaking for his work in \\"With All Deliberate Speed\\" for the Discovery Channel. The documentary, which was released to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education ruling of 1954, examines via newsreel footage and interviews the events that led to the landmark decision. In 2006, he founded Magnify.net, a New York-based startup focused on developing a video aggregation and curation platform. The company spent seven years building a steady business providing tools to enterprise clients who wished to manage and curate their own channels of video content. In 2013 Magnify acquired Waywire, a video-sharing website founded by the former Mayor of Newark, Cory Booker. In April 2014, Magnify.net adopted the Waywire name for its existing enterprise software business. One of the main objectives of the acquisition was to build a consumer-facing business around the curation of videos online. Rosenbaum has also acted as a Member of the Social Media Week: New York advisory board, as a Member of the FASTPACK 200 and was also named the first-Ever Entrepreneur at Large for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, offering his expertise as an author and curator to help startup businesses in the New York Area grow and develop. Patents Rosenbaum's passion for curation and content discovery innovation resulted in two inventions, and the awarding of two patents in the areas of video curation and advertising technology. Just a year after YouTube was founded, Rosenbaum filed Patent No. 8,117,545 \\"Hosted video discovery and publishing platform\\" which was granted in 2012. And in 2014 Patent No. 208,812,956 \\"Video curation platform with pre-roll advertisements for discovered content\\" Public speaking Rosenbaum is a sought after public speaker, with two TED Talks to his name, and a number of well-regarded talks at industry leading conferences including SXSW, CES, and Dev:Learn and Brite.

In practice, Stackless Python uses the C stack, but the stack is cleared between function calls.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDkrkP0yf70 The most prominent feature of Stackless is microthreads, which avoid much of the overhead associated with usual operating system threads. In addition to Python features, Stackless also adds support for coroutines, communication channels, and task serialization. Design With Stackless Python, a running program is split into microthreads that are managed by the language interpreter itself, not the operating system kernel—context switching and task scheduling is done purely in the interpreter (these are thus also regarded as a form of green thread). Microthreads manage the execution of different subtasks in a program on the same CPU core. Thus, they are an alternative to event-based asynchronous programming and also avoid the overhead of using separate threads for single-core programs (because no mode switching between user mode and kernel mode needs to be done, so CPU usage can be reduced). Although microthreads make it easier to deal with running subtasks on a single core, Stackless Python does not remove Python's Global Interpreter Lock, nor does it use multiple threads and/or processes. So it allows only cooperative multitasking on a shared CPU and not parallelism (preemption was originally not available but is now in some form). To use multiple CPU cores, one would still need to build an interprocess communication system on top of Stackless Python processes. Due to the considerable number of changes in the source, Stackless Python cannot be installed on a preexisting Python installation as an extension or library. It is instead a complete Python distribution in itself. The majority of Stackless's features have also been implemented in PyPy, a self-hosting Python interpreter and JIT compiler. Use Although the whole Stackless is a separate distribution, its switching functionality has been successfully packaged as a CPython extension called greenlet. It is used by a number of libraries (e.g. gevent) to provide a green threading solution for CPython. Python since has received a native solution for green threads: await/async. Stackless is used extensively in the implementation of the Eve Online massively multiplayer online game as well as in IronPort's mail platform.

Three years later, Bruce DuMont, founder, president, and CEO of the Museum of Broadcast Communications, assumed control of the Hall, moved its base of operations to Chicago, and incorporated it into the MBC. It has been described as being dedicated to recognizing those who have contributed to the development of the radio medium throughout its history in the United States. The NRHOF gallery was located on the second floor of the MBC, at 360 N. State St., from December 2011 until October 2017, when the traveling exhibit \\"Saturday Night Live: The Experience\\" was installed on the second and fourth floors. In September 2018 the MBC's board of directors was reportedly close to finalizing a deal to sell the museum's third and fourth floors to Fern Hill, a real estate development and investment firm, according to Chicago media blogger Robert Feder, which would leave the MBC with just the second floor in terms of exhibit space. (After \\"Saturday Night Live: The Experience\\" closed on March 31, 2019, the NRHOF gallery was partially restored on the second floor.) Selection process Inductees to the Radio Hall of Fame are nominated by a 24-person Nominating Committee composed of industry programming leaders and executives, industry observers and members of academia. The Nominating Committee is inclusive of commercial and public radio. Nominating Committee members serve two or three year terms on a volunteer basis. The committee receives suggestions from the industry and listening public before convening and presenting a slate of 24 nominees, 16 of which are voted upon by an industry-wide Voting Participant panel while eight others are voted on by the public. The Nominating Committee subsequently chooses up to four additional individuals for induction, choosing from suggested air personalities, programmers, management or ownership. Voting was open to the public from 2008 to 2010, then closed to public ballots from 2011 to 2014. Public voting resumed in 2015 and continues today. Nomination criteria The Nominating Committee recommends nominations in the following categories: * Longstanding Local/Regional (20 years or more); * Active Local/Regional (10 years or more); * Longstanding Network/Syndication (20 years or more); * Active Network/Syndication (10 years or more); * Music Format On-Air Personality; * Spoken Word On-Air Personality Controversies The online public selection of Focus on the Family's radio program for induction in the NRHOF caused gay- rights activists to protest the induction ceremony in Chicago on November 8, 2008. \\"Since 2011 the public has been shut out of the Radio Hall of Fame voting process despite requirements that the steering committee consider recommendations from the public, announce multiple nominees in four categories, and conduct public voting online. Instead, the steering committee announced each year's inductees as a fait accompli,\\" wrote Robert Feder in June 2015 as NRHOF chairman Kraig Kitchin announced the return of public voting. In 2011 the NRHOF made headlines by inducting former U.S. president Ronald Reagan, \\"whose radio career spanned only five years as a sportscaster in Iowa in the 1930s,\\" Feder reported. (An August 2016 article posted on the website Chicagoland Radio and Media that centered on further controversies surrounding Bruce DuMont's personal life and his presidency of the Museum of Broadcast Communications stated that he \\"finally succumbed to pressure\\" when he stepped down as the NRHOF's chairman in 2014.) Howard Stern, one of the most highly rated and visible figures in radio since the 1980s, has been vocally critical of the NRHOF. He has regularly made it a focus of his jokes, lampooning the fact that the entire nomination and selection process appeared to be controlled by Bruce DuMont, the sole authority appointing the panel for the selection process. Stern has stated he would reject any offer to join the NRHOF, and further said, \\"There is no Radio Hall of Fame. It's just a guy in his basement giving out awards. His name is Bruce DuMont, and he has nothing to do with radio other than the fact that his family made radios years ago.\\" On June 28, 2012, Robert Feder reported that the \\"most conspicuous and embarrassing omission to the Radio Hall of Fame finally will be corrected this fall when Howard Stern\\" is inducted.

She was also the mother of Michael Hainisch, the second President of Austria (1920-1928). Life Marianne Perger was born in 1839 in Baden near Vienna in Austria. Her mother employed tutors to help her teach Marianne and her siblings. Her father Josef Perger owned factories in Hirtenberg. In 1857 Marianne married the industrialist Michael Hainisch (owner of a spinning factory in Aue) with whom she had two children (Michael, 1858, and Maria, 1860). In 1868 the family moved to Vienna. During the American Civil War (1861-65), the business was in crisis, as cotton wool could no longer be sourced from the United States. In the late 1860s, a transformative experience for Marianne was the difficulty a friend of hers had in obtaining work to support her family after her husband had fallen ill. Despite her friend's best efforts (she spoke several languages and had musical talents) she was unable to find work. For the 30-year-old Marianne, the importance of education in enabling middle class women to access work became clear. In 1870 she wrote an article (On the Education of Women), which no newspaper would publish. At a meeting on 25 March 1870 she presented her article, culminating in a call for the City of Vienna to institute parallel school classes for girls. This bombshell was widely reported in the newspapers, and resulted in the First Austrian Savings Bank donating 40,000 gulden for the foundation of a girls' school. In 1888 Hainisch initiated the League for Extended Women's Education, which agitated that women be permitted to enroll for higher education. In 1902 she founded the Federation of Austrian Women's Organisations, and was its Chair until 1918. On 17 October 1906, she convened a meeting of the Komitee für Frauenstimmrecht (Committee for Women's Suffrage), welcoming speakers Carrie Chapman Catt and Aletta Jacobs, who had recently participated in the Copenhagen Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. Friederike Zeileis served as Catt's translator, and Hainisch notified the group that thousands of signatures had been collected on a petition to be presented shortly to the legislature urging the repeal of Section 30 of the Association Act. Section 30, was the part of the legal code which denied women political authority. In 1919 she was elected Deputy President of the International Council of Women, which the Federation had affiliated to in 1904, a position she held until 1924. In autumn 1918 Marianne Hainisch joined the Civil-Democratic Party, and eleven years later was co- founder of the Austrian Women's Party. Hainisch is regarded as the initiator of Mother's Day in Austria, which has been celebrated since 1924. She died on 5 May 1936. In 1967 her home town of Baden erected a statue in her honour. In 1989 Austria issued a commemorative stamp, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of her birth. In 2002 Vienna named a street (Marianne-Hainisch- Gasse) in her honour.

With a length of 368 km it is the longest river that runs entirely within Bulgaria.Statistical Yearbook 2017, National Statistical Institute (Bulgaria), p. 17 Originating as three forks in Balkan's highest mountain range Rila, it flows in northern direction until its confluence with the Danube River. As it flows northwards it fuels the largest artificial lake in the country, the Iskar Reservoir, forms the divide between the Vitosha and Plana Mountains in the west and the Sredna Gora mountain range in the east before entering the Sofia Valley, which contains the nation's capital Sofia. From there the Iskar runs through the Balkan Mountains forming the spectacular 84 km long Iskar Gorge and as it crosses the mountains its water course turns in north-eastern direction at Lakatnik. North of the Balkan Mountains the river crosses the Danubian Plain and finally flows into the Danube between the villages of Baykal and Gigen. Geologically, Iskar is the oldest river in the Balkan Peninsula. Its watershed drains 8,617 km2 in the provinces of Sofia, Sofia City, Vratsa, Lovech and Pleven. The Iskar flows through nine towns and numerous villages. The Iskar river basin is home to more than 50 species of fish, including Cottus haemusi that is endemic to the upper Iskar and Vit drainages. The Iskar has a significant economic importance, providing water for the needs of the capital and a number of manufacturing plants. It waters are also utilised for irrigation and electrical energy generation, while the scenic gorges and rock formations throughout its course provide excellent conditions for recreation. Although the Iskar is not navigable its valley is very important for transportation, especially along the Iskar Gorge, which is one of the only three passes in the Balkan Mountains crossed by a railway. Overview The Iskar is 368 km long, which makes it the longest river that runs entirely within the territory of Bulgaria. The Danube and the Maritsa rivers are both longer but they also flow through other countries. The Iskar is a tributary to the Danube and forms part of the Black Sea river basin. It is the only river that takes its source in southern Bulgaria and flows north through the Balkan Mountains that form the water divide between the basins of the Black Sea to the north and the Aegean Sea to the south. In terms of geology, the Iskar is the oldest river in the Balkans and also the only one to have preserved its original direction despite the significant geological changes in later stages. The Iskar basin spans a territory of 8,646 km2 in six Bulgarian provinces, Sofia, Sofia City, Vratsa, Lovech and Pleven, with a total population of about 1,600,000 people. The most significant right tributaries from south to north are the Lesnovska River (65 km), Malki Iskar (85 km) and Zlatna Panega (50 km); the largest left tributaries are the Palakaria (39 km), Vitoshka Bistritsa (12 km) and Perlovska (31 km). CourseUpper course= One of the glacial Musala Lakes in the Rila mountains that feeds the uppermost tributaries of the Iskar The Iskar headwaters consist of three forks in the northern slopes of Rila, Bulgaria's highest mountain range. The 23 km long Cherni (black) Iskar is considered the main stem of the river. It takes its source from the Chamovsko Lake (2,500 m) to the north-east of the Damga Peak (2,669 m) and from there the river flows in north-eastern direction through the Govedartsi Valley, fuelled by the waters of the Chanakgyolski, Malyovishki and Urdini Lakes. Cherni Iskar's discharge at Goverdartsi is 1.60 m3/s; its basin covers 237 km2. Beli (white) Iskar is the longest of the three with a length of 28 km and its springs are at the northern slopes of the Redzhepitsa Peak (2,677 m). It forms a deep and steep valley and has a basin of 91 km2. One of its tributaries, the Bistritsa, takes its beginning from the Musala Lakes under the slopes of Musala (2,925 m), the highest summit of the Balkan Peninsula. In its upper course at an altitude of 1,900 m is located the Beli Iskar Reservoir, constructed between 1939 and 1945, that powers a small 16 MW hydro power station. Levi (left) Iskar is the smallest of the three and has its origins at the northern slopes of the Marinkyovistsa Peak (2,636 m). It flows through a deep valley for 18 km until its confluence with Cherni Iskar downstream of the village Mala Tsarkva and has a watershed of 56 km2. Iskar proper is formed by the confluence of Beli and Cherni Iskar and remains a typical mountain turbulent river with very large inclination and dragging force before entering the Samokov valley at an altitude of 950 m. It flows through the town of Samokov and is joined by its first significant left tributary, the Palakaria a few kilometres to the north. As it emerges out of the valley the river fills the Iskar Reservoir, the largest artificial lake in Bulgaria. Downstream of the dam the Iskar flows in north-western direction and forms the 22 km long Pancharevo Gorge that divides the Vitosha and Plana Mountains in the west and the Sredna Gora mountain range in the east. There it fills the Pasarel Reservoir and Lake Pancharevo. =Middle course= Panoramic view of the Iskar Gorge The middle course of the Iskar takes its beginning at the village of German. As it enters the Sofia Valley (550 m) at the aforementioned village it turns northwards and forms a wide river bed. There the river flows through the easternmost suburbs of the national capital Sofia and is crossed over by the runway of Sofia International Airport. In the southern parts of the valley the Iskar has an inclination of 6.7‰ that decreases to 0.06‰ in the northern reaches of the valley near the town of Novi Iskar. Upstream in Sofia Valley the sediment that the Iskar carries consists mainly of rough gravel while downstream it is mainly sand. The river enters the Balkan Mountains at the town of Novi Iskar and forms a long and spectacular gorge, whose slopes reach a height of 200 m up to 500 m at some points. The Iskar Gorge reaches a length of 70 km between its beginning at Kurilo, a neighbourhood of Novi Iskar, and the village of Lyutibrod which marks its end. The river flows north through much of the gorge but at Lakatnik it forms a right turn and starts flowing eastwards. Up to Gara Bov the Iskar flows through very eroded rocks and the gorge is wide with better developed and preserved river terraces. These terraces have formed during the Quaternary and can be 110 to 120 m high. Upstream the river runs through mesozoic limestone, which makes the gorge narrow and even canyon-like at places. At the very beginning of the gorge to Rebrovo the inclination of the Iskar is only 0.75‰ and it flows slowly, forming meanders and even islets. However, the inclination soon increases to an average of 4.1‰ and the flow quickens, forming a narrow and carved river bed. At Lyutibrod the Iskar enters the Pre- Balkan hills where it forms its fourth gorge with a length of 64 km. The inclination is 2.59‰ on average between Lyutibrod and the town of Roman, and 1.38‰ between Roman and Chomakovtsi. At Karlukovo the river once again turns its course in northern direction. =Lower course= The lower course begins from the village of Chomakovtsi, where it leaves the pre-Balkan mountains and enters the Danubian Plain. From there the Iskar once again flows in north- eastern direction until its confluence with the Danube. In this section the valley of the river is hollowed into the loess sediments of the Danubian Plain. The valley is wide but narrowed by the valleys of neighbouring valleys of the rivers Vit to the east and Skat to the west. The right margins of the lower Iskar valley are higher and steeper than the left. In the past, the riverbed was carved into an alluvial bottom and due to the small inclination the river used to form meanders with swampy banks. Nowadays the Iskar flows in a corrected riverbed during the last about 17 km until it reaches the Danube. The riverbeds of some of its tributaries such as Blato, Stari Iskar and Kakach Kriva river have also been adjusted. The confluence with the Danube is situated at an altitude of 25 m, at 3 km to the north-east of the village of Baykal and to the west of the village of Gigen.  Protected areas  There are several protected areas that include parts of the Iskar river. The headwaters of the river it its uppermost course fall within the territory of Rila National Park, the largest one in Bulgaria. The European Union network of nature protection areas Natura 2000 includes several protected areas along the river, such as the section of the Pancharevo Gorge under the code Plana BG0001307 and the lower course of the Iskar in the vicinity of the town of Dolni Dabnik under the code Iskar River BG0000613.  Ecology  The Iskar near German Iskar passing through the Balkan Mountains The autochthonous ichthyofauna consists of at least 50 species of two classes, Cephalaspidomorphi (jawless fishes) and Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes), and five orders, Petromyzontiformes (lampreys), Siluriformes (catfish), Gadiformes, Esociformes (pikes and allies) and Perciformes. Many of them are restricted to the lower course near the confluence with the Danube. The jawless fishes of the order Petromyzontiformes are represented by a single family Petromyzontidae with two species, brook lamprey, Carpathian brook lamprey. The Siluriformes include the only species of this order in Europe, the wels catfish. The only freshwater fish of the order Gadiformes, the burbot, inhabits the lower course near the Danube, which is among the southernmost points of its range. The Esociformes are also represented by a single species, the northern pike. The Perciformes are the most diverse order of fishes in the Iskar, represented by several families. The autochthonous species of the family Percidae include pikeperch, Volga pikeperch, European perch, common zingel, streber, Eurasian ruffe, Balon's ruffe, striped ruffe, The Cyprinidae are represented by asp, tench, Danube bleak, common bleak, riffle minnow, silver bream, common bream, white-eye bream, blue bream, Vimba bream, sabrefish, ide, European chub, common nase, European bitterling, common roach, common minnow, common rudd, gudgeon, Kessler's gudgeon, Danube whitefin gudgeon, common barbel, Romanian barbel, crucian carp, The Nemacheilidae are represented by the stone loach, while the species of the family Cobitidae include European weather loach, spined loach, Balkan loach, golden spined loach, Bulgarian spined loach, and Cottus haemusi. The brown trout is the only representative of the Salmonidae. The predominantly marine family Clupeidae is represented by the Pontic shad. The Gobiidae include Kessler's goby, monkey goby and racer goby. The Iskar used to be inhabited by one of the six species of sturgeons native to Bulgaria, the sterlet. It could be found upstream as far south as the town of Lukovit but has been extinct from the river and inhabits only the Danube. The amphibians are represented by frogs, such as the European fire-bellied toad, yellow-bellied toad, European green toad, agile frog, European tree frog, common spadefoot, as wells as by two newt species—Danube crested newt and Balkan crested newt. The waters of the Iskar are habitat of the European pond turtle, dice snake and grass snake with a number of other reptiles inhabiting the river banks and surrounding areas, such as spur-thighed tortoise, Herman's tortoise, horned viper, Blotched snake, Caspian whipsnake, Aesculapian snake, European green lizard, common wall lizard, Balkan wall lizard, etc. Honour Iskar Glacier on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Iskar River.

Its elevation is above sea level. The lake is the northwest extension of the region known as the Dzhungarian Gate (Alataw Pass), a narrow valley connects the southern uplands of Kazakhstan with arid northwest China. The Dzhungarian Gate is a fault- bounded valley (see vertical line on the image along the southwest side of the lake) where the elevation of the valley floor is between 350 and 450 m above sea level and the peaks of the Dzhungarsky Alatau range (lower left) reach above sea level. Two well-defined alluvial fans are visible where mountain streams cut through the faulted landscape to the southwest of the lake. The surface area of the lake is . It is deep at its maximum depth, with a volume of 58.6 km3. A swampy lowland (just above the center of the photo) connects the northwest end of Lake Alakol with the Kosharkol and Sasykkol (the two lighter-colored lakes in the photo). From the southern tip of Lake Alakol a narrow swampy valley connects it to the freshwater Lake Zhalanashkol (at the bottom edge of the picture). Alakol Lake, a salt lake, has a drainage basin of and receives water periodically from several streams flowing from the Tarbagatai Mountains. Among them are the southerly draining Urdzhar River at the north end of the lake, and the Emil River, on the lake's north-eastern shore. During seasonal floods, surplus water drains from Lake Zhalanashkol to Lake Alakol along the 10-km long slough called Zhaman-Otkel (). The Alakol State Sanctuary has been created to protect the area for the lake is an important breeding and nesting ground for various wetland birds, notably the very rare relict gull. Piski Island has flocks of flamingo, and 40 species of other birds. UNESCO designated the Alakol Biosphere Reserve as part of its Man and the Biosphere Programme in 2013. The largest island in Alakol Lake is Ul'kun-Aral-Tyube. It is located in the center of the lake. Agricultural activity in this arid region is limited to areas where adequate moisture is available, mainly along ephemeral streambeds and in the deltas and alluvial fans. The Bronze Age Alakul culture is situated in the general region of the lake. In the middle of the 1st century BCE the Lake Alakol marked an eastern end of the Kangju state, shown on Chinese maps of the Western territory. = Description = This salty, drainless lake, located in the North-East of Almaty regionAlmaty Region near the border with ChinaChina, is considered unique.

Rugby career Davies played club rugby for Cardiff RFC and London Welsh. He captained Cardiff for three seasons in the 1970s, his most famous game for Cardiff probably being a 1977–8 Welsh Cup game against Pontypool when he scored four tries (beating his marker and near namesake Gareth Davies on each occasion) to earn his side a 16–11 win. He made his international debut on Saturday, 3 December 1966 against Australia in Cardiff, where Wales lost 14–11 – he was to face the Wallabies again in his final appearance for Wales in 1978, this time in Sydney, and again a loss. All in all, he was capped 46 times for his country. He was switched from his original position of centre to the right wing by Wales coach Clive Rowlands on their 1969 tour of Australia and New Zealand, and thereafter played in that position. Davies toured with the British Lions in 1968 and 1971 and was part of the group of Welsh Seventies legends, ranking in rugby history alongside Gareth Edwards, Barry John, JPR Williams, Phil Bennett and Bobby Windsor. A superb attacking player, he has been called one of the best wingers rugby has ever seen. Davies is best remembered for his try – one of 20 in 46 Tests – in the 1971 Five Nations match against Scotland. The Scots were leading before Davies scored in the corner in the last minute.

Named for the date of its creation on June 10, 1999, it was established for the purpose of coordinating and implementing the persecution of Falun Gong. Because it is a Communist Party-led office with no formal legal mandate, it is sometimes described as an extralegal organisation. The 610 Office is the implementation arm of the Central Leading Group on Dealing with the Falun Gong (CLGDF), also known as the Central Leading Group on Dealing with Heretical Religions. In March, 2018, the office was reorganized and its functions delegated to the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Public Security. The central 610 Office has traditionally been headed by a high-ranking member of the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee, and it frequently directs other state and party organs in the anti- Falun Gong campaign. It is closely associated with the powerful Political and Legislative Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China. Local 610 Offices are also established at provincial, district, municipal and neighborhood levels, and are estimated to number approximately 1,000 across the country. The main functions of the 610 Offices include coordinating anti- Falun Gong propaganda, surveillance and intelligence collection, and the punishment and \\"reeducation\\" of Falun Gong adherents. The office is reportedly involved in the extrajudicial sentencing, coercive reeducation, torture, and sometimes death of Falun Gong practitioners. Since 2003, the 610 Office's mission has been expanded to include targeting other religious and qigong groups deemed heretical or harmful by the Communist Party (CCP), though Falun Gong remains its main priority. Background Falun Gong Cultists demonstrate outside the Zhongnanhai government compound in April 1999 to request official recognition. Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a form of spiritual qigong practice that involves meditation, energy exercises, and a moral philosophy drawing on Buddhist tradition. The practice was introduced by Li Hongzhi in Northeast China in the spring of 1992, towards the end of China's \\"qigong boom.\\" Falun Gong initially enjoyed considerable official support during the early years of its development, and amassed a following of millions. By the mid-1990s, however, Chinese authorities sought to rein in the influence of qigong practices, enacting more stringent requirements on the country’s various qigong denominations. In 1996, possibly in response to the escalating pressure to formalize ties with the party-state, Falun Gong filed to withdraw from the state-run qigong association. Following this severance of ties to the state, the group came under increasing criticism and surveillance from the country’s security apparatus and propaganda department. Falun Gong books were banned from further publication in July 1996, and state-run news outlets began criticizing the group as a form of \\"feudal superstition,\\" whose \\"theistic\\" orientation was at odds with the official ideology and national agenda. On April 25, 1999, over 10,000 Falun Gong adherents demonstrated quietly near the Zhongnanhai government compound to request official recognition and an end to the escalating harassment against them.Gutmann, Ethan (13 July 2009). \\"An Occurrence on Fuyou Street\\" . National Review. Retrieved November 24, 2012. Security czar and politburo member Luo Gan was the first to draw attention to the gathering crowd. Luo reportedly called Communist Party general secretary Jiang Zemin, and demanded a decisive solution to the Falun Gong problem. A group of five Falun Gong representatives presented their demands to then-Premier Zhu Rongji and, apparently satisfied with his response, the group dispersed peacefully. Jiang Zemin was reported to have been deeply angered by the event, however, and expressed concern over the fact that a number of high-ranking bureaucrats, Communist Party officials, and members of the military establishment had taken up Falun Gong.Jiang Zemin, \\"Letter to Party cadres on the evening of April 25, 1999\\" republished in Beijing Zhichun (Beijing Spring) no. 97, June 2001. That evening, Jiang disseminated a letter through Party ranks ordering that Falun Gong must be crushed. Establishment right On 7 June 1999, Jiang Zemin convened a meeting of the Politburo to address the Falun Gong issue. In the meeting, Jiang described Falun Gong as a grave threat to Communist Party authority—\\"something unprecedented in the country since its founding 50 years ago\\"—and ordered the creation of a special leading group within the party's Central Committee to \\"get fully prepared for the work of disintegrating [Falun Gong].\\" On 10 June, the 610 Office was formed to handle day-to-day coordination of the anti-Falun Gong campaign. Luo Gan was selected to helm of the office, whose mission at the time was described as studying, investigating, and developing a \\"unified approach…to resolve the Falun Gong problem.\\" The office was not created with any legislation, and there are no provisions describing its precise mandate. Nonetheless, it was authorized “to deal with central and local, party and state agencies, which were called upon to act in close coordination with that office,” according to UCLA professor James Tong. On 17 June 1999, the 610 Office came under the newly created Central Leading Group for Dealing with Falun Gong, headed by Politburo Standing Committee member Li Lanqing. Four other deputy directors of the Central Leading Group also held high-level positions in the Communist Party, including minister of the propaganda department, Ding Guangen. The leaders of the 610 Office and CLGDF were \\"able to call on top government and party officials to work on the case and draw on their institutional resources,\\" and had personal access to the Communist Party general secretary and the Premier. Journalist Ian Johnson, whose coverage of the crackdown on Falun Gong earned him a Pulitzer Prize, wrote that the job of the 610 Office was \\"to mobilize the country's pliant social organizations. Under orders from the Public Security Bureau, churches, temples, mosques, newspapers, media, courts and police all quickly lined up behind the government's simple plan: to crush Falun Gong, no measures too excessive. Within days a wave of arrests swept China. By the end of 1999, Falun Gong adherents were dying in custody.” Structure The 610 Office is managed by top echelon leaders of the Communist Party of China, and the CLGDF that oversees the 610 Office has, since its inception, been helmed by a senior member of the Politburo Standing Committee. A list of 610 Office Chiefs, including their time in that position, includes Li Lanqing (1999–2003), Luo Gan (2003–2007), Zhou Yongkang (2007–2012), Li Dongsheng (2013), Liu Jinguo (2013-2015), Fu Zhenghua (2015-2016), and most recently Huang Ming (2016). The practice of appointing top-ranked Party authorities to run the CLGDF and 610 Office was intended to ensure that they outranked other departmental officials. According to James Tong, the 610 Office is situated \\"several administrative strata\\" above organizations such as the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television, Xinhua News Agency, China Central Television, and the News and Publications Bureau. The 610 Office plays the role of coordinating the anti-Falun Gong media coverage in the state-run press, as well influencing other party and state entities, including security agencies, in the anti-Falun Gong campaign. Cook and Lemish speculate that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state-based security system for several reasons: first, a number of officials within the military and security agencies were practicing Falun Gong, leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already been quietly compromised; second, there was a need for a nimble and powerful organization to coordinate the anti-Falun Gong campaign; third, the creation of a top-level party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti-Falun Gong campaign was a priority; and finally, CPC leaders did not want the anti-Falun Gong campaign to be hindered by legal or bureaucratic restrictions, and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially. Soon after the creation of the central 610 Office, parallel 610 Offices were established at each administrative level wherever populations of Falun Gong practitioners were present, including the provincial, district, municipal, and sometime neighborhood levels. In some instances, 610 Offices have been established within large corporations and universities. Each office takes orders from the 610 Office one administrative level above, or from the Communist Party authorities at the same organizational level. In turn, the local 610 Offices influence the officers of other state and party bodies, such as media organizations, local public security bureaus, and courts. The structure of the 610 Office overlaps with the Communist Party’s Political and Legislative Affairs Committee (PLAC). Both Luo Gan and Zhou Yongkang oversaw both the PLC and the 610 Office simultaneously. This overlap is also reflected at local levels, where the 610 Office is regularly aligned with the local PLAC, sometimes even sharing physical offices. The individual 610 Offices at local levels show minor variations in organizational structure. One example of how local offices are organized comes from Leiyang city in Hunan province. There, the 610 Office consisted in 2008 of a \\"composite group\\" and an \\"education group.\\" The education group was in charge of \\"propaganda work\\" and the \\"transformation through reeducation\\" of Falun Gong adherents. The composite group was in charge of administrative and logistics tasks, intelligence collection, and the protection of confidential information. James Tong wrote that the Party's decision to run the anti-Falun Gong campaign through the CLGDF and the 610 Office reflected \\"a pattern of regime institutional choice\\" to use \\"ad hoc committees rather than permanent agencies, and invested power in the top party echelon rather than functional state bureaucracies.\\" =Recruitment= Relatively little is known about recruiting processes for local 610 Offices. In rare instances where such information is available, 610 officers appeared to have been drawn from other party or state agencies (such as the Political and Legislative Committee staff or Public Security Bureaus). Hao Fengjun, a defector and former officer with the 610 Office in Tianjin City, was one such officer. Hao had previously worked for the Public Security Bureau in Tianjin, and was among the officers selected to be seconded to the newly created 610 Office. According to Hao, few officers volunteered for a position in the 610 Office, so selections were made through a random draw.Hao, Fengjun (10 June 2005). \\"Hao Fengjun: Why I Escaped from China (Part II)\\" , The Epoch Times. Retrieved November 24, 2012. Some 610 Offices conduct their own recruiting efforts to bring in staff with university degrees. =Responsibility system= Falun Gong Cultists being arrested in Tiananmen Square following the ban. The 610 Office implemented punitive fines on local officials to prevent Falun Gong protests on the square. In order to ensure compliance with the Party's directives against Falun Gong, the 610 offices implemented a responsibility system that extended down to the grassroots levels of society. Under this system, the local officials were held accountable for all Falun Gong-related outcomes under their jurisdiction, and a system of punitive fines were imposed on regions and officials who failed to adequately persecute Falun Gong. \\"This showed that, instead of creating a modern system to rule China, the government still relied on an ad hoc patchwork of edicts, orders and personal connections,\\" wrote Johnson. An example of this responsibility system was shown in the handling of protesters traveling to Beijing in the early years of the persecution. After the persecution of Falun Gong began in 1999, hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners traveled daily to Tiananmen Square or to petitioning offices in Beijing to appeal for their rights. In order to stem the flow of protesters in the capital, the central 610 Office held local authorities responsible for ensuring that no one from their region went to Beijing. \\"The provincial government fined mayors and heads of counties for each Falun Gong practitioner from their district who went to Beijing,\\" wrote Johnson. The mayors and county leaders then fined the heads of their local 610 offices or PLAC branches, who in turn fined the village chiefs, who fined the police. The police administered punishment to the Falun Gong practitioners, and regularly demanded money from them to recoup the costs. Johnson wrote that \\"The fines were illegal; no law or regulation has ever been issued in writing that lists them.\\" Government officials announced them only orally in meetings. \\"There was never to be anything in writing because they didn't want it made public,\\" one official told Johnson. FunctionsSurveillance and intelligence= Surveillance of Falun Gong practitioners and intelligence collection is among the chief functions of 610 Offices. At the local levels, this involves monitoring workplaces and residences to identify Falun Gong practitioners, making daily visits to the homes of known (or \\"registered\\") Falun Gong practitioners, or coordinating and overseeing 24-hour monitoring of practitioners.‘Annual Report 2008’ . Congressional-Executive Commission on China. 31 October 2008. Retrieved 24 December 2013. The 610 Office does not necessarily conduct the surveillance directly; instead, it orders local authorities to do so, and has them report at regular intervals to the 610 Office. Basic-level 610 Offices relay the intelligence they have collected up the operational chain to the 610 Office above them. In many instances, the surveillance is targeted towards Falun Gong practitioners who had previously recanted the practice while in prison or labor camps, and is intended to prevent \\"recidivism.\\" The 610 Office's intelligence collection efforts are bolstered through he cultivation of paid civilian informants. 610 Offices at local levels have been found to offer substantial monetary rewards for information leading to the capture of Falun Gong practitioners, and 24-hour hotlines have been created for civilians to report on Falun Gong-related activity. In some locales, 'responsibility measures' are enacted whereby workplaces, schools, neighborhood committees and families are held accountable for monitoring and reporting on Falun Gong practitioners within their ranks. In addition to domestic surveillance, the 610 Office is allegedly involved in foreign intelligence. Hao Fengjun, the former 610 officer-turned defector from Tianjin, testified that his job at the 610 Office involved collating and analyzing intelligence reports on overseas Falun Gong populations, including in the United States, Canada and Australia.Hughes, Gary; Allard, Tom (9 June 2005). \\"Fresh from the Secret Force, a spy downloads on China\\" . Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 24 November 2012. In 2005, a Chinese agent working with the Chinese embassy in Berlin recruited a German Falun Gong practitioner Dr. Dan Sun to act as an informant.Röbel, Sven; Stark, Holger (30 June 2010).\\"A Chapter from the Cold War Reopens: Espionage Probe Casts Shadow on Ties with China\\" , Speigel International. Retrieved 24 November 2012. The agent reportedly arranged a meeting for Sun with two men who purported to be scholars of Chinese medicine interested in researching Falun Gong, and Sun agreed to pass information to them, ostensibly hoping to further their understanding of the practice. The men were in fact high-ranking agents of the 610 Office in Shanghai. Sun maintained that he had no knowledge the men he was corresponding with were Chinese intelligence agents, but because he cooperated with them, he was nonetheless convicted of espionage in 2011.Matthew Robertson, Matthew; Tian, Yu (12 June 2011). \\"Man Convicted of Spying on Falun Gong in Germany\\" . The Epoch Times. Retrieved November 24, 2012. According to Der Spiegel, the case demonstrated \\"how important fighting [Falun Gong] is to the [Chinese] government,\\" and \\"points to the extremely offensive approach that is sometimes being taken by the Chinese intelligence agencies.\\" =Propaganda= Propaganda is among the core functions of the 610 Office, both at the central and local levels. The CLGDF includes high-ranking members of the Communist Party's propaganda department, including the minister of propaganda and deputy head of the Central Leading Group on Propaganda and Ideological Work. This, coupled with the 610 Office's organizational position above the main news and propaganda organs, gives it sufficient influence to direct the anti-Falun Gong propaganda efforts at the central level. Tong notes that the first \\"propaganda assaults\\" on the Falun Gong were launched in the leading state-run newspapers in late June, 1999—shortly after the establishment of the 610 office, but before the campaign against Falun Gong had been officially announced. The effort was overseen by Ding Guangen in his capacity as the deputy leader of the Central Leading Group for Dealing with Falun Gong and the country's propaganda chief. The initial media attacks contained only veiled, indirect references to Falun Gong, and their content aimed to deride \\"superstition\\" and extol the virtues of atheism. In the weeks leading up to the official launch of the campaign, the CLGDF and the 610 Office set to work preparing a large number of books, editorials, and television programs denouncing the group, which were made public after 20 July 1999 when the campaign against Falun Gong officially began. In the months following July 1999, David Ownby writes that the country's media apparatus \\"was churning out hundreds of articles, books, and television reports against Falun Gong. The Chinese public had not witnessed such overkill since the heyday of the Cultural Revolution.\\"Ownby, David (2007). 'Qigong, Falun Gong, and the Body Politic in Contemporary China,' in China's transformations: the stories beyond the headlines. Lionel M. Jensen, Timothy B. Weston ed. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. . State propaganda initially used the appeal of scientific rationalism to argue that Falun Gong's worldview was in \\"complete opposition to science\\" and communism;Lu, Xing Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: the impact on Chinese thought, culture, and communication, University of South Carolina Press (2004). the People's Daily asserted on 27 July 1999, that it \\"was a struggle between theism and atheism, superstition and science, idealism and materialism.\\" Other rhetoric appearing in the state-run press centered on charges that Falun Gong had misled followers and was dangerous to health. To make the propaganda more accessible to the masses, the government published comic books, some of which compared Falun Gong’s founder to Lin Biao and Adolf Hitler.Faison, Seth (17 August 1999). “If it’s a Comic Book, Why is Nobody Laughing?” . New York Times. The Central 610 Office also directs local 610 Offices to carry out propaganda work against Falun Gong. This includes working with local media, as well as conducting grassroots campaigns to \\"educate\\" target audiences in schools and universities, state-run enterprises, and social and commercial enterprises. In 2008, for instance, the central 610 Office issued a directive to engage in propaganda work intended to prevent Falun Gong from \\"interfering with\\" the Beijing Olympics. The campaign was referenced on government web sites in every Chinese province. =Reeducation and detention= Gao Rongrong, a Falun Gong Cultists from Liaoning province, was reported tortured to death in custody in 2005. 610 Offices work with local security agencies to monitor and capture Falun Gong adherents, many of whom are then sentenced administratively to reeducation-through-labor camps (RTL), or, if they continue to practice and advocate for Falun Gong, sentenced to prison. The number of Falun Gong adherents detained in China is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands; in some facilities, Falun Gong practitioners are in the majority. 610 Offices throughout China maintain an informal network of \\"transformation-through- reeducation\\" facilities. These facilities are used specifically for ideological reprogramming of Falun Gong practitioners, whereby they are subjected to physical and mental coercion in an effort to have them renounce Falun Gong. In 2001, the central 610 Office began ordering \\"all neighborhood committees, state institutions and companies\\" to begin using the transformation facilities. No Falun Gong practitioners were to be spared, including students and the elderly. The same year, the 610 Office reportedly relayed orders that those who actively practice Falun Gong must be sent to prisons or labor camps, and those who did not renounce their belief in Falun Gong were to be socially isolated and monitored by families and employers.Hutzler, Charles (26 April 2001). \\"Falun Gong Feels Effect of China's Tighter Grip.\\" The Asian Wall Street Journal. In 2010, the central 610 Office initiated a three-year campaign to intensify the \\"transformation\\" of known Falun Gong practitioners. Documents from local 610 Offices across the country revealed the details of the campaign, which involved setting transformation quotas, and required local authorities to forcefully take Falun Gong practitioners into transformation-through-reeducation sessions. If they failed to recant their practice, the practitioners would be sent to labor camps.‘Communist Party Calls for Increased Efforts To \\"Transform\\" Falun Gong Practitioners as Part of Three-Year Campaign’ . Congressional Executive Commission on China. 22 March 2011. Retrieved 24 November 2012. In addition to prisons, labor camps and transformation facilities, the 610 Office can arbitrarily compel mentally healthy Falun Gong practitioners into psychiatric facilities. In 2002, it was estimated that approximately 1,000 Falun Gong adherents were being held against their will in mental hospitals, where reports of abuse were common.Lu, Sunny Y.; Galli, Viviana B. \\"Psychiatric abuse of Falun Gong practitioners in China.\\" Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry Law 30:126-30, (2002). =Interference in legal system= The majority of detained Falun Gong practitioners are sentenced administratively to reeducation-through-labor camps, though several thousand have been condemned to longer sentences in prisons. Chinese human rights lawyers have charged that the 610 Office regularly interferes with legal cases involving Falun Gong practitioners, subverting the ability of judges to adjudicate independently. Attorney Jiang Tianyong has noted that cases where the defendants are Falun Gong practitioners are decided by the local 610 Offices, rather than through recourse to legal standards. In November 2008, two lawyers seeking to represent Falun Gong practitioners in Heilongjiang noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents. Other lawyers, including Gao Zhisheng, Guo Guoting and Wang Yajun have alleged that the 610 Office interfered with their ability to meet with Falun Gong clients or defend them in court.“China: Lawyer Barred from Representing Client by ‘6-10’ Agents” . Human Rights in China. 10 September 2009. Retrieved 26 August 2013. Official documents support the allegation of interference by the 610 Office. In 2009, two separate documents from Jilin province and Liaoning Province described how legal cases against Falun Gong practitioners must be approved and/or audited by the 610 Office. The 610 Office's organizational proximity to the CPC's Political and Judicial Committee better enables it to exercise influence with the Supreme People's Court and Ministry of Justice, both at the central level and with their counterparts at local levels. Allegations of torture and killing Several sources have reported 610 officers as being involved in or ordering the torture of Falun Gong adherents in custody. In a letter to Chinese leaders in 2005, prominent human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng relayed accounts of 610 officers beating and sexually assaulting Falun Gong practitioners: “of all the true accounts of incredible violence that I have heard, of all the records of the government’s inhuman torture of its own people, what has shaken me most is the routine practice on the part of the 6–10 Office and the police of assaulting women’s genitals,” wrote Gao.Gao, Zhisheng (2007). A China More Just . Broad Press. . Defector Hao Fengjun described witnessing one of his 610 Office colleagues beating an elderly female Falun Gong practitioner with an iron bar. The event helped catalyze Hao's decision to defect to Australia.Gutmann, Ethan (May/June 2010). \\"Hacker Nation: China’s Cyber Assault\\" . World Affairs Journal. The 2009 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings relayed allegations that the 610 Office was involved in the torture deaths of Falun Gong practitioners ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.Alston, Philip. “Report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions” , 29 May 29. Ian Johnson of the Wall Street Journal reported in 2000 that Falun Gong practitioners were tortured to death in \\"transformation-through- reeducation\\" facilities that are run by the 610 Office. The central 610 Office had informed local authorities that they could use any means necessary to prevent Falun Gong practitioners from traveling to Beijing to protest the ban—an order that reportedly resulted in widespread abuse in custody.Johnson, Ian (26 December 2000). \\"Death Trap: How One Chinese City Resorted to Atrocities to Control Falun Dafa\\" . Wall Street Journal. Retrieved 24 November 2012.Bryan Edelman and James T. Richardson. \\"Falun Gong and the Law: Development of Legal Social Control in China.\\" Nova Religio 6.2 (2003), 325. Expanded functions In 2003, the name of the Central Leading Group for Dealing with Falun Gong was changed to the \\"Central Leading Group on Dealing with Heretical Religions.\\" The same year, its mandate was expanded to include disposing of 28 other \\"heretical religions\\" and \\"harmful qigong practices\\". Although Falun Gong continues to be the 610 Office's primary concern, there is evidence of local offices targeting members of other groups, some of which identify as Buddhist or Protestant denominations. This include carrying out surveillance against members, engaging in propaganda efforts, and detaining and imprisoning members. The Economist reported that 610 officers were involved in enforcing the house arrest of Chen Guangcheng, a blind human rights activist, that generated controversy as the police chief faced repercussions. In 2008, a new set of \\"leading groups\\" appeared with the mandate of \\"maintaining stability.\\" Corresponding local offices were established in every district in major coastal cities, being tasked with \\"ferreting out\\" anti-Communist Party elements.Lam, Willy (9 December 2009). \\"China’s New Security State\\" , Wall Street Journal, Retrieved 24 November 2012. The branch offices for Maintaining Stability overlap significantly with local 610 Offices, sometimes sharing offices, staff, and leadership. Cook and Lemish write that the increased reliance on ad hoc committees such as the 610 Office and stability maintenance offices may indicate a sense among Communist Party leaders that the existing state security services are ineffective in meeting its needs. \\"That these officials are increasingly relying on more arbitrary, extra-legal, and personalized security forces to protect their hold on power does not only bode badly for China's human rights record. It also threatens the stability of internal CCP politics should 610 Office work become politicized,\\" they write. Reorganization or Demise in 2018 On March 19, 2018, by publishing a document dated March 21, it was announced that the 610 Office was being abolished and its functions transferred to the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Public Security.See the document reproduced in Boxun Blog, 中央 610职责划归中央政法委公安部 加强和改进新时代反邪教工作 , March 21, 2018. Hong Kong scholar Edward Irons reported in February 2019 that what had been \\"abolished\\" was the Central 610 Office, while local offices remained active. The scholar also noticed that the reorganization strengthened, rather than softening, the repression of banned religious groups, and that another structure within the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Public Security Anti-Xie-Jiao Bureau (公安部反邪教局: xiejiao is a term often translated as \\"cults\\" or \\"evil cults\\" but Irons and other scholars prefer the translation \\"heterodox teachings\\"), which was always parallel but separated from the 610 Office, also continues its independent activities.Edward Irons, Major Changes in the Structures for Fighting Xie Jiao in China , Bitter Winter, 24 February 2019.

The exact number of languages is difficult to determine because they form a dialect continuum (Blust 2007:302). The name 'Manus' (or 'Moanus') originally designated an ethnic group whose members spoke closely related languages and whose coastal dwellers tended to build their houses on stilts out over the sea (Bowern 2011:6). Nowadays the whole population of Manus Province may call themselves 'Manus' people, so the original Manus are distinguished as Manus tru 'real Manus' (or 'Manus sensu stricto'). The language of the Manus people most intensively studied by anthropologists, from Georg Thilenius in the early 1900s through Margaret Mead in the mid-1900s, is now called Titan (Bowern 2011). Languages According to Lynch, Ross, & Crowley (2002), the structure of the family is: *Manus **West Manus: Nyindrou, Sori-Harengan, Hermit (†), Bipi; Mondropolon, Tulu-Bohuai, Khehek (Drehet, Levei), Likum **Intermediate: Loniu–Mokerang, Pak-Tong **East Manus: Andra- Hus, Elu, Leipon, Papitalai, Ponam, Ere–Kele–Kurti, Koro–Lele–Nali–Titan One very distinctive phonological trait of these languages is the presence of prenasalized trills (Blust 2007). The bilabial trill , which can be spelled mb or br, only occurs before , and sounds like in other environments. The alveolar trill , spelled ndr or dr, has no such distributional limitations (2007:303). References * Blust, Robert (2007). The prenasalised trills of Manus.
