Written by Lane Slate, it stars Alan Alda, Louise Lasser and Edmond O'Brien, and was directed by John Badham. Plot Dan Barnes (Alan Alda) is the police chief of tiny Mt. Angel, Oregon, population 1360. Barnes' life is complicated by a romance with a local motel owner who is eager to have him move in with her and her young children. Despite trying to keep his private life private, the relationship is well known in the community, especially to his co-workers. His life is further complicated when the sleepy village is beset by a killer preying on the elderly. The first victim is Janet Barber, who is found nude. She appears to have died in her sleep of a heart attack. Barnes finds it odd that the elderly Barber did not appear to have owned a nightgown or pajamas. Barber's husband, Ralph, who had been out of town when she died, is later found dead in the nude also. When Barnes' lieutenant, Jesse Chapin (Lloyd Nolan), dies of an apparent heart attack at 63, Barnes suspects murder. An autopsy discovers that Chapin's corpse has an unusual odor, like turpentine or nutmeg. Chapin's faithful dog, which had been missing, is later found dead. The dog's corpse has the same odor, and there are burn marks on its fur. The police receptionist, Blanche (Louise Lasser), has an epiphany about the human victims: they were all part of the local high school's graduating class of 1928. She and Barnes pore through a yearbook and identify a potential victim. When Barnes drives to the person's isolated house, his police cruiser is rammed and disabled by another automobile, which turns around to finish him off. Barnes escapes into the woods. Circling around to the isolated house, he finds the owner already dead. After a fifth member of the class of '28 dies of a heart attack, the coroner reports that the odor is from conductive gel used with defibrillators. He recommends that a modified defibrillator is being used to induce heart attacks. Because the class of '28 was small, the limited evidence and process of elimination leads Barnes to suspect another member of that class, Justin Oates (Edmond O'Brien). Until recently, Oates was a guest at Barnes' girlfriend's motel. Barnes tracks him down and arrests him. An evaluation reveals that Oates felt mistreated by his classmates, but old wounds were reopened when Ralph Barber began having an extramarital affair with Oates' high school sweetheart. It is recommended that he be remanded to the care of a mental health facility for the criminally insane. A subplot woven throughout concerns Barnes considering a job offer from a nearby town that might make it easier to settle down with his girlfriend. Barnes ultimately turns it down and decides to stay in Mt. Angel.

The album is a compilation of Xuxa's most popular songs in English versions for her TV show - Xuxa - but the material was never released commercially neither in America, nor in Brazil. Background  Xuxa is a Brazilian entertainer who made her singing debut in 1985 with the Portuguese language album Xuxa e Seus Amigos. In 1990, she began releasing Spanish music in both North and South America, which was well received. An English language album for the U.S. market was planned to hit stores in 1994, to coincide with the release of the second season of her English language variety show Xuxa. The album was to consist of 20 English adaptions of her previous Portuguese songs and one new original song, Talk to Me for which the album was named. Production For the American television show, Xuxa re-recorded several of her hits in English. The songs have had their length shortened - allegedly a decision by the network so they were not long and tiring. In addition to the hits already known to her Latin fans, Xuxa also recorded an entire new song titled Talk to me, which explicitly made an appeal for the public to be patient in regards to her poor English.Kinder, Marsha. Kids' Media Culture - p.212 The song featured a typical Brazilian sound with drums, also known in her native as \\"Ax√©\\" (ah-sheh). Most songs have simply added new voice over the instrumental material used in her Spanish and Portuguese versions. In majority most of the lyrics were translations with words carefully chosen not to lose rhyme however songs such as Do Say have turned out completely unrelated to its Portuguese and Spanish counterparts. The opening and closing theme used in the show was Xuxa's Theme (in Portuguese \\"O Xou da Xuxa Come√ßou\\"). The songs have only been released on cassette tape.  Availability  In 1994, the Sony Wonder has acquired domestic home video rights of television series Xuxa, and launched two gift boxes on VHS: Xuxa: Funtastic Birthday Party and Xuxa Celebration! with Cheech Marin. A counterfeit version of the unreleased CD ripped from old VHS tapes and featuring poor quality for most songs have been found in online shops. It appears that these fake CDs were selling reasonably well until Xuxa Produ√ß√µes (Xuxa's production company) got them removed.

Though related to CL-20 in that is shares the same cage structure, TEX is more easily synthesized in good yield from inexpensive starting materials.A. T. Nielsen Polycyclic Amine Chemistry, in G. A. Olah, D. R. Squire, Chemistry of Energetic Materials (Eds.) Academic Press, 1991, p. 110-111 Unlike CL-20, TEX is friction insensitive, bears a low impact sensitivity, and possesses a very low shock sensitivity and large critical diameter, making it an interesting explosive filler for insensitive munitions. Its systematic name, 4,10-dinitro-2,6,8,12-tetraoxa-4,10-diazatetracyclo[5.5.0.05,9.03,11]-dodecane derives from its tetracyclic structure. Synthesis and production Unlike CL-20, which requires a cumbersome and even costly procedure, TEX is obtained in moderate yield (40 wt.-%) in a one-pot synthesis from 1,4-diformyl-2,3,5,6-tetrahydroxypiperazine (DFTHP) and mixed acid (H2SO4/HNO3). The DFTHP undergoes proton-catalyzed hydrolysis and yields glyoxal which reacts as with an intermediate to give TEX. :Formation of TEX from DFTHP Performance Based on the Kamlet-Jacobs method, the formal idealistic detonation of TEX :C6H6N4O8 ‚Üí 3 H2O(g) \\\\+ 2CO2 \\\\+ CO + 3 C(gr) \\\\+ 2 N2 at ambient temperature and density of TEX (1.985 g/cm3) yields a detonation velocity of 8170 m/s and a CJ pressure of 31.4 GPa. Calculations with advanced computer codes like EXPLO and CHEETAH call for even higher detonation velocity but about similar values for the detonation pressure definitely superseding insensitive high explosive NTO. Experimental determination with plastic bonded formulations at high theoretical maximum density exceed the predicted detonation pressures but fall a little short with regards to the detonation velocity if the charge diameter is below 90 mm. Sensitivity TEX is not friction sensitive and requires some 40 Joules energy to react in the BAM impact tester. In the autoignition test it yields a mild burn response at 252 ¬∞C onset temperature. TEX is also mildly shock sensitive in the Large Scale Gap Test (LSGT).  Toxicity  TEX has a similar water solubility as RDX and hence will be equally mobile in soil and groundwater. However, in comparison to insensitive explosive NTO, which is highly soluble in water (16 g/l), it should pose a lower level of concern when considering the environmental effects of unexploded or partially exploded charges. Preliminary investigation of the effects of TEX on daphnia and cell cultures show slightly lower toxicity than RDX. Application Though known since 1990 TEX is still an experimental explosive. However, given its large critical diameter and low shock sensitivity, it is an ideal candidate for insensitive large-calibre ammunition such as general-purpose bombs, artillery shells, torpedo- and depth charges.

Erpf Professor of Modern Corporations of the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University. Before that he was a professor in the Department of Economics at Yale University. His scholarly efforts concerned industrial relations and labor economics, the economies of corporations and corporate planning, national planning, and social values and corporate social responsibility. He was the author of nineteen books, editor of six more, published numerous articles in academic journals, and wrote an intellectual memoir as well. His range of research and writing was unusually wide, but his biggest contribution to the field of economics was in the study of industrial relations and especially in his analysis of bargaining power. Early life, education, and writing Chamberlain was born on May 18, 1915, in Charlotte, North Carolina, as the son of Henry Bryan Chamberlain and the former Elizabeth Wolverton. After search, entry found and purchased is for \\"Neil Cornelius Wolverton Chamberlain (Deceased) / economist, emeritus educator; Born: 1915\\" When he was two years old the family moved to Ohio and he grew up in Lakewood, Ohio. From the time of junior high school on, he was interested in creative writing, working on poems, short stories, and an incomplete novel.Chamberlain, Intellectual Odyssey, p. vii. While at Lakewood High School, which he began as the Great Depression was starting, he took third prize in national Scholastic Art & Writing Awards with a short story called \\"Hunger\\". Another short story, \\"A Millionaire's Debut\\", was published in the Cleveland News. During vacations when he was 17 and 18, Chamberlain traveled around the country by hitchhiking and freighthopping. A San Francisco newspaper recounted his wandering journey with another 18-year-old friend from Cleveland to there, in which they started with only $3.77, washing dishes for funds while staying in hobo jungles and sometimes encountering long waits for cars to pick them up. By the age of 19, he said he had traveled some and seen 41 states. He offered to give 15-minute talks, titled \\"The Category of Dreamers\\" and concerning the state of youth, in the Lakewood area.\\"The Category of Dreamers\\", flyer, c. 1934. He attended Adelbert College of Western Reserve University, having been granted a scholarship, and initially majored in history.Chamberlain, Intellectual Odyssey, p. 1. He was elected Phi Beta Kappa as a senior. He was also a poet there, winning first prize as a junior and second prize as a senior in the Rupert Hughes Prizes in Poetry. In 1937, he graduated with an A.B. degree magna cum laude. Chamberlain was initially primarily interested in writing as a career possibility. While a freshman he was also working as editor of the People's Penny Weekly, a magazine intended to provide local coverage of Lakewood. During his senior year in college he worked part-time at the Cleveland bureau of the International News Service.Chamberlain, Intellectual Odyssey, p. 2. There he covered many significant developments in labor relations during the mid-1930s. These included the Fisher Body sit-down strike against General Motors. By his account he then tried two other writing and editing jobs before, after a year's lapse, returning to his education to give himself an understanding of the forces at play in these labor disputes.Chamberlain, Intellectual Odyssey, p. 3. At the Graduate School at Western Reserve University, he earned an M.A. degree in economics in 1939. At the same time he wrote a play about the Chrysler Auto Strike of 1939, From Now to Hallelujah, which he later said was accepted for production at a local theater group but never put on due to a scheduling conflict. He also later recalled functioning as executive secretary of a successful campaign to amend the Cleveland city charter to bring most civil service employees under the merit system.Chamberlain, Intellectual Odyssey, p. 147. Chamberlain then obtained a Ph.D. in economics from Ohio State University in 1942. The topic of his dissertation was \\"The Nature and Practice of Collective Bargaining\\". By now his practice of other forms of writing was being replaced by his interest in economic research. During the latter portion of this time he was a research fellow at the Brookings Institution. Chamberlain married the former Mariam Kenosian in 1942. During the World War II period, he was in the United States Naval Reserve from 1942 to 1946, where he began as an ensign and finished as a lieutenant. There he did work related to cryptography. Meanwhile, his wife worked as an analyst for the Office of Strategic Services during the war and then earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1950. Early career Following his service, Chamberlain was given a Social Science Research Council demobilization fellowship and in 1946 found a position as research director at the Yale Labor and Management Center, which had shortly before been founded by E. Wight Bakke.Chamberlain, Intellectual Odyssey, p. 4. By 1947 he was also an assistant professor of economics at Yale. His first major book, The Union Challenge to Management Control , was published in 1948. In 1949 he became assistant director of the Labor and Management Center. That same year, he became an associate professor. Chamberlain's early work at Yale and the center and his books published during this time focused on exploring matters related to bargaining in the context of labor-management conflicts, the social impact of strikes, and the idea of managerial discretion and how unions challenged it. His insights into industrial relations theory as a whole became a substantial addition to scholarly knowledge. His definition of bargaining power, which is based upon the notion of the \\"inducement to agree\\", became widely used. Examining the history of many labor-management actions and conflicts as case studies, he analyzed their tactics with his framework of how each sought to influence relative bargaining power. His analysis of bargaining power and its effects went beyond concepts introduced by others earlier and provided a springboard for the examination of behavioral aspects of the bargaining process as well as bargaining power as a dynamic entity. Influencing several generations of scholars, Chamberlain's work on bargaining power would become his most significant contribution to the field.Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, \\"Neil W. Chamberlain\\", pp. 143‚Äì145. His 1951 textbook Collective Bargaining presented some of these ideas and was twice later republished in revised editions. His work on strikes, which was published in two books, Social Responsibility and Strikes (1953) and The Impact of Strikes: Their Social and Economic Costs (1954), was done in collaboration with Jane Metzger Schilling, an assistant in research at the center and a doctoral student in the Department of Economics at YaleTitle and facing title pages of Social Responsibility and Strikes and The Impact of Strikes; Chamberlain, Intellectual Odyssey, p. 18. who was working on research into invention and innovation and into the scope of bargaining units. Their work devised a quantitative framework for analyzing the effect of strikes on the various parties involved as well as on the general public, making use of reliable figures when available and forming imprecise judgments when not, then sought to evaluate seventeen recent strikes in the coal, rail, and steel industries in these terms. They also made public policy recommendations regarding when government intervention should be undertaken, saying that such action must take into effect the loss of income for producers as well as the loss of goods and services for consumers. The second of these books became one of Chamberlain's works to be translated into other languages, in this case Japanese.„Çπ„Éà„É©„Ç§„Ç≠„ÅÆÊêçÁõäË®àÁÆó : ÁµåÂñ∂ËÄÖ„ÉªÂä¥ÂÉçËÄÖ„ÉªÂÖ¨Ë°Ü„ÅÆÊêçÂÆ≥„Çí„Å©„ÅÜÁÆóÂÆö„Åô„Çã„Åã Sutoraiki no son'eki keisan : Keieisha r≈çd≈çsha k≈çsh≈´ no songai o d≈ç santeisuruka, translated by Minoru Kuronuma, published T≈çky≈ç : Daiyamondosha, 1957. While Chamberlain self- identified as an industrial relations specialist, he nonetheless next wrote A General Theory of Economic Process, an attempt to define the overall economic environment in ways that provided entr√©e for the insights of his labor analyses. It was the most ambitious effort he ever undertook. In its preface he wrote, \\"Such an effort may appear pretentious when made by one who lays no claim to being a general theoretician ... I feel (almost apologetically) a need to explain the existence of this work.\\"Chamberlain, A General Theory of Economic Process, p. vii. In it he used bargaining as the central element for economic analysis.Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, \\"Neil W. Chamberlain\\", pp. 149‚Äì150. Middle career Chamberlain moved to Columbia University, where he was a professor of economics in its Graduate School of Business from 1954‚Äì59. There he replaced the retiring Paul Frederick Brissenden as head of the school's program in Labor and Industrial Relations.Chamberlain, Intellectual Odyssey, p. 56. This was part of a wave of hirings as the business school sought to improve its intellectual standing by strengthening its research program and instituting a Ph.D. program separate from that of the Department of Economics. During this time, Chamberlain was recruited by Thomas H. Carroll of the Ford Foundation, who was starting an effort for the improvement of business school education. Chamberlain thus became director of the Program in Economic Development and Administration at the foundation from 1957 to 1960, where he also focused a research program on business decision making. Chamberlain subsequently returned to Yale as a professor of economics for the period 1959‚Äì1967. In the 1960s, Chamberlain's research began to focus on theory of the firm and industrial organization, as exemplified by his 1962 book The Firm: Micro-Economic Planning and Action.Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, \\"Neil W. Chamberlain\\", pp. 151‚Äì153. In particular he examined corporate planning and public planning. These works adopted some of the approaches of institutional economics and were less quantitative and more philosophical than some of the author's previous efforts. He then branched out even further afield, writing about nuclear disarmament in 1963 and population economics in 1970. In the first, he argued that \\"if what everyone says [they want] (peace and disarmament) is eventually achieved, the consequences are almost certain to be the end of 500 years of Western world supremacy.\\"Chamberlain, The West in a World Without War, p. vii. Chamberlain was prominent in the Industrial Relations Research Association, serving on its executive board during 1955‚Äì58 and its president in 1967. Chamberlain served on the board of editors of The American Economic Review from 1957‚Äì59, the board of directors of the Salzburg Seminar in American Studies for 1957‚Äì78, the editorial council of Management International during 1960‚Äì70, and two stints on the board of trustees of the Columbia Journal of World Business (1969‚Äì72, 1975‚Äì80). He and his wife Mariam Chamberlain divorced in 1967. She joined the Ford Foundation and became the director of its higher education program; the grants she dispensed during the 1970s would become instrumental in establishing the place of women's studies at colleges in the United States. Meanwhile, he married Harriet Feigenbaum in 1968. She is a sculptor most known for a 1990 installation in New York City, Memorial to Victims of the Injustice of the Holocaust. Chamberlain returned to Columbia's Graduate School of Business again to stay for good in 1967, heading a new program in Corporate Relations and Public Policy.Chamberlain, Intellectual Odyssey, p. 97. He was named the Armand G. Erpf Professor of Modern Corporations in 1969. In the wake of the Columbia University protests of 1968, Chamberlain was on the side of those who prized the restoration of order in American and European academies, signing on to a 1969 statement by hundreds of faculty members proclaiming that, \\"Academic freedom and the sanctuary of the university campus extend to all who share these aims and responsibilities. They cannot be invoked by those who would subordinate intellectual freedom to political ends, or who violate the norms of conduct established to protect that freedom. Against such offenders the university has the right, and indeed the obligation, to defend itself.\\" Later career During the latter part of his career, Chamberlain took on the analysis of the role of corporation management in society.Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, \\"Neil W. Chamberlain\\", p. 153. In a series of books from 1973 on he became known as an economist who found insights in the relationship of business power to social power. He also became involved in community-related projects such as a 1972 plan to help decentralize city services in nearby Washington Heights, Manhattan. Tackling the issue of corporate responsibility, his 1973 book The Limits of Corporate Responsibility Chamberlain said that businesses could do \\"remarkably little\\" about urban problems, environmental degradation, product safety, or worker dissatisfaction, because the values of the business culture are incompatible with such goals and economic forces will constrain businesses to only actions which result in growth and profit. Writing for The New York Times Book Review, Stephen B. Shepard said that Chamberlain made a strong case for business not being able to solve urban woes, but that elsewhere he overstated his thesis and underestimated the chances that businesses could be part of environmental improvement solutions. Chamberlain retired in 1980, after which he became the Armand G. Erpf Professor Emeritus at Columbia. His last academic book, Social Strategy and Corporate Structure, was published in 1982. Over the course of his career, Chamberlain became more pessimistic in his conclusions, believing that notions about union-management collaboration would have scant impact on the corporation's ability to react to external events.Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, \\"Neil W. Chamberlain\\", p. 156. He also grew dissatisfied with the development of economic analysis, believing it too formal and beholden to quantitative methods and lacking a value-based look at how corporate management behaved. Indeed, Chamberlain became skeptical about his discipline as a whole. In the context of a 1980 New York Times piece about the hazards of poorly conducted social science research, he was quoted as saying, \\"We know very little about what we profess to know. We have claimed too much as a profession.\\" He came to have philosophical doubts about the entire study of economics, believing that purposeful action, unforeseen trends, and random occurrences combine to give economic theories that are based upon the observation of what has taken place in the past little predictive ability or policy-making usefulness in terms of what will take place in the future. Chamberlain thus abandoned economic work altogether after 1982, deciding that he wanted to return to writing fiction. He worked on at least two novels during this period,Chamberlain, Intellectual Odyssey, p. 213. although nothing was published, and he painted as well. He published a memoir of sorts, Intellectual Odyssey: An Economist's Ideological Journey, in 1996. It traced the development of his interests and summarized the work and conclusions of many of his books. The last chapter of the memoir includes lengthy excerpts from one of the novels, whose protagonist is a disillusioned economics professor considering whether to retire and struggling with philosophical questions.Chamberlain, Intellectual Odyssey, pp. 213‚Äì218. Chamberlain died at age 91 on September 14, 2006. Legacy Writing in the Journal of Economic Issues in 1996, Charles J. Whalen said that \\"Chamberlain's career in economics has been extraordinary.\\" In a 1983 retrospective of Chamberlain's career written shortly after his retirement and published in the British Journal of Industrial Relations, three business professors at Columbia University ‚Äì James W. Kuhn, David Lewin, and Paul J. McNulty ‚Äì analyzed where his work had had the greatest scholarly influence and where it had been less so. Their conclusion was that despite a fair amount of the latter, \\"Chamberlain stands ... as an intellectual giant and a major intellectual force, whose legacy will endure.\\" Chamberlain's definition of bargaining power is still taught and used, such as in its presentation in the 2012 textbook Fundamentals of Labor Economics by Thomas Hyclak, Geraint Johnes, and Robert Thornton and in the 2004 fifth edition of the popular International City/County Management Association \\"Green Book\\" Management Policies in Local Government Finance. In terms of the labor history discipline, Chamberlain came to be seen as part of the mainstream, along with scholars such as Sumner Slichter and Richard Lester, who focused on institutions and laws, as opposed to \\"new labor history\\" and its adherents, such as David Brody and Nelson Lichtenstein, who focused more on demographics and social history. Like two other scholarly pioneers in industrial relations and labor research, Robert F. Hoxie and John R. Commons, Chamberlain was dissatisfied with neoclassical economics-based theory and sought to provide new and different explanations for the economic process.Kuhn, Lewin, and McNulty, \\"Neil W. Chamberlain\\", p. 157. This foray into general theory, like those of the other two, generally found few followers in the field. Chamberlain was given a lifetime achievement award by the Industrial Relations Research Association for 2002, handed out during its 2003 meeting. (The IRRA subsequently renamed itself to the Labor and Employment Relations Association.) He was one of the first members of that association to be so honored. Following his death, Dean of the Columbia Business School Glenn Hubbard said Chamberlain that \\"produced work of great importance to the greater business community, always with an active and curious mind.\\" David B. Lipsky, former Dean of the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, characterized Chamberlain as \\"one of the greatest of all industrial relations scholars\\" and said that, \\"For scholars of my generation, Neil was a giant ‚Äì through the rigor and originality of his research he inspired us to believe that a career devoted to industrial relations research could be a noble undertaking.\\" Published works * Collective Bargaining Procedures (American Council on Public Affairs, 1944) * The Union Challenge to Management Control (Harper & Brothers, 1948) * Cases on Labor Relations (The Foundation Press, 1949) [co-editor with Harry Shulman] * Management in Motion: The Corporate Decision-Making Process as Applied to the Transfer of Employees (Labor and Management Center, Yale University, 1950) [report] * Collective Bargaining (McGraw-Hill, 1951; second edition, 1965 [with James W.

It was built . It is also known as Eton. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Hellesvere, a timber cottage on Upper Roma Street, was constructed in about 1877 for Francis Curnow who became Queensland's third Railway Commissioner. The site of Hellesvere was part of a larger block acquired by land speculator, James Gibbon, in 1852. In 1875 when some of Gibbon's block was resumed for the construction of the Brisbane Terminal Railway Station (now Roma Street railway station) the remaining land was subdivided for sale. By 25 August 1877 Francis Curnow who was an employee of the railway bought one of the allotments and it was on this land that Hellesvere was soon after built. Curnow arrived in Queensland in March 1860 from Cornwall in Britain and by 1866 settled in Ipswich as a railway storekeeper, a position made necessary by the opening of the Ipswich- Grandchester line. He was promoted in January 1877 to the position of Chief Clerk in the Railway Commissioner's Office, a position second only to that of the Commissioner. The offices for the staff of the Secretary for Railways in Queensland were established on the grounds of the original Brisbane Terminal Station at Roma Street, possibly in the early Brisbane Grammar School, resumed for railway purposes. In 1877 Curnow built Hellesvere, close to his place of work, on the block of land he bought from Gibbons. Hellesvere was a timber cottage with a steeply pitched corrugated iron roof containing an attic with dormer windows on the northern and southern sides. In January 1884 Curnow was promoted to be the position of Acting Commissioner for Railways and on 12 March 1885 was again promoted to the position of Commissioner for Railways. Curnow was the third person to hold this position, superseding Arthur Orpen Herbert who became the Under Secretary for Railways. During the time of Curnow's employment as Commissioner of Railways, the Railways Act (1888) was introduced to create a Board of three Commissioners to oversee decision making in the railways, in a bid to reduce political influence. The appointment of the Board of Commissioners on 29 July 1889 prompted Francis Curnow to retire from the railways with a pension of . He was soon after appointed Chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Commission, a position he held until shortly before his death from typhoid fever induced heart failure at Hellesvere, on 24 April 1901. He was buried at Toowong Cemetery. Early photographs of Hellesvere show that the house has been changed very little externally, simple timber balustrades have been removed from the sides of the northern (front) verandah and a similar balustrade has been removed from the rear. A room enclosed on the western end of the southern (rear) verandah. An early photograph shows a tree in the front yard similar to that extant now in the same place. Hellesvere appears as the name of Curnow's house from the 1885-1886 edition of the Queensland Post Office Directories. Hellesvere remained in the Curnow family until 1909. It was then sold to George Keal and then changed hands many until it became the property of John Dimitriou Architects. During its history Hellesvere has been used as a boarding house and as flats. In the 1930s, owner Mrs Curtis named it Eton and operated it as a boarding house. John Dimitriou Architects were responsible for the removal of more recent accretions and the reconstruction of some early details. When describing the house in the 1982 publication, More Historic Homes of Brisbane, Ray Sumner states that the building \\"stands in a street of intact but mutilated old houses\\". Now, however, Upper Roma Street retains almost no small residences like Hellesvere, these houses have been replaced with large office and temporary accommodation boarding facilities. Hellesvere is therefore an important and rare remnant of what was an early residential street in inner-city Brisbane, containing such homes as Roma Villa and Highmead, the house of early pioneer Simeon Lord. In 2015, Hellesvere was operated as Eton Hostels.  Description  Hellesvere is a single storeyed timber residence with attic and partial basement situated on Upper Roma Street, overlooking, to the north, a railway cutting and beyond this Red Hill. The house now subsumes most of the block with a narrow driveway on the eastern side and a small parking lot to the south. Many early plants and trees survive around the building. The building is generally a timber framed cottage clad with chamferboards which sits on a brick foundation and basement. Verandahs runs along the southern and northern elevations of the building. The pyramidal corrugated iron roof of Hellesvere is penetrated on the north and south elevations with dormer windows. A brick chimney stack with three flues also projects toward the western edge of the roof. The principal entrance facade, facing Roma Street to the south, is symmetrically arranged with a central doorway flanked by vertical sash windows. The verandah awning which is supported on pairs of stop-chamfered timber columns with decorative fretwork brackets, features a projecting triangular pediment infilled with fretwork emphasising the entrance. The windows on the east and west sides of the building are shaded with corrugated iron clad timber framed hoods with vertical battened returns. The lower level of the western face of the building has two entrances' a pair of French doors and a more recent single door. Internally the building is arranged with rooms off a central hall, towards the rear of which is a timber boarded door leading to a timber stair with cantilevered treads providing access to the attic. The attic which comprises two rooms, separated by a half glazed door, has a raked ceiling following the roof line, projecting through which are the dormer windows. Generally the interior has beaded timber boards for internal partitions, the external walls and attic ceiling are clad internally with beaded boards with an additional central bead. Toward the south of the house V-J timber boards are used for internal partitions. A door at the end of the hallway provides access to the rear, southern verandah. The lower floor is accessed via a timber stair with cantilevered treads similar to the internal stair, and this stair is on the rear verandah. At the base of the stairs and running along the line of the first floor verandah is timber decking from which two doors are accessed to the lower floor. Though much internal re-arrangement is obvious on the lower floor an early brick oven recess is evident in what is now the boardroom.  Heritage listing  Pursuant to the transitional provisions of the Queensland Heritage Act 1992, all buildings listed in the Schedule to the Heritage Buildings Protection Act 1990 were taken to be places entered provisionally in the Queensland Heritage Register. Hellesvere was transferred as a provisional entry to the Heritage Register on the basis that it was listed in the schedule to the Heritage Buildings Protection Act 1990. This decision was effective as from 21 August 1992, the date of proclamation of the Queensland Heritage Act 1992. Further to the transitional provisions of the Queensland Heritage Act 1992, Hellesvere entered permanently in the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992, having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Francis Curnow, a distinguished employee of the Railway, built Hellesvere near his workplace at the first Brisbane terminal railway station which had been recently completed. Hellesvere is one of the very few extant nineteenth century buildings on or near Roma Street and provides evidence of the early residential nature of this area. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Hellesvere is one of the very few extant nineteenth century buildings on or near Roma Street and provides evidence of the early residential nature of this area. The building is a good intact example of an 1870s Queensland house in the inner city, with a rare extant basement kitchen. Such houses were once commonly found in the city but are now rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a good intact example of an 1870s Queensland house in the inner city, with a rare extant basement kitchen. Such houses were once commonly found in the city but are now rare. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building has aesthetic value as a well composed timber dwelling which is a landmark on Upper Roma Street as an early building with distinctive steeply pitched pyramidal roof. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Hellesvere is important as the house of Francis Curnow, the third Railway Commissioner of Queensland, employed in the late nineteenth century when the expansion of the railway was the major force behind the development of the infant colony of Queensland.

Ainscough went by the self-coined nickname \\"The Wellness Warrior\\" and used her popular blog by the same name to share her personal story of using alternative cancer treatments. Ainscough died of her untreated cancer at the age of 29. Background Jessica Ainscough was born in Australia in the South East Queensland city of Ipswich. Ainscough attended Sunshine Coast University, graduating in 2005 with a Bachelor of Communications and majoring in Journalism. During her last year at university, Ainscough gained work experience at the Sydney office of 9 to 5 Magazine where she had her first job after graduating. At the time of her diagnosis, Ainscough was working as an online editor for teen magazine Dolly. Ainscough and her partner Tallon Pamenter were engaged in July 2014 and had planned to marry in September 2015. Cancer =Diagnosis= Ainscough was diagnosed with epithelioid sarcoma on April 24, 2008 following a biopsy of lumps removed from her left arm and hand. From the initial diagnosis, Ainscough recalls being informed that epithelioid sarcoma was an extremely rare cancer and difficult to treat. The incidence of epithelioid sarcoma was reported as 0.4 cases per million in 2005. It is twice as likely to occur in men, and three quarters of those diagnosed are between the age of 10 and 39 years. Although epithelioid sarcoma is less common in women, the prognosis has been reported to be more favourable. Surgical oncologist David Gorski has written that without treatment most succumb to the disease within 10 years, however with surgical resection the 10-year survival rate is estimated to be 49-72%, with higher survival rates reported in younger patients such as Ainscough. =Initial treatment= Initially, the only treatment offered to Ainscough was an amputation of the affected arm at the shoulder, known as a forequarter amputation. Ainscough reluctantly agreed, however, shortly before the scheduled surgery her medical team offered an alternative treatment which was to have an isolated limb perfusion. Ainscough consented to chemotherapy and had the procedure in June 2008. The initial scans following chemotherapy showed that the cancer was in remission, however, by November the following year the cancer had returned, and the only treatment option was a forequarter amputation. Ainscough refused to have the amputation, and instead turned to alternative cancer treatments. =Alternative cancer treatment= Following her second cancer diagnosis, Ainscough began using Gerson Therapy, an ineffective alternative cancer treatment. Her condition was monitored by her \\"Gerson doctor\\" in Mexico who would receive Ainscough's blood tests, along with results from live blood analysis and iridology, two fraudulent alternative diagnostic techniques, and conduct analysis using a machine called an \\"Indigo\\", which was claimed to be a quantum biofeedback device. Influencers and supporters At \\"Wellness Warrior Events\\", Ainscough was joined by other celebrity wellness entrepreneurs who would also share their alternative health journeys, including former actor Melissa Ambrosini, musician Wes Carr and celebrity chef Pete Evans. Ainscough invited Cyndi O'Meara, nutritionist and fellow Sunshine Coast wellness entrepreneur, to write the foreword of her book, and later acknowledged O'Meara as the person she admired most professionally. Ainscough also spoke and wrote extensively about the influence of her mother Sharyn Ainscough and alternative cancer treatment advocate Ian Gawler. Her funeral was attended by Belle Gibson, who falsely claimed to have cured cancer through alternative therapies. Ainscough claimed that Ian Gawler's book, You can Conquer Cancer, was a major influence on her when she was initially diagnosed with cancer. Immediately before going to the Gerson clinic in Mexico in 2010, Ainscough and her partner Tallon Pamenter stayed at The Gawler Foundation. Afterwards, Ainscough wrote: \\"Last month I spent 10 days at the Gawler Foundation in Melbourne learning all about how to heal myself. It was the most beneficial 10 days of my life\\". Gawler Foundation founder Ian Gawler is a former Veterinarian who survived cancer after surgical treatment, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Gawler claims to have overcome a secondary diagnosis of terminal metastatic cancer with a combination of Gerson Therapy and meditation. However, there was no biopsy taken to confirm the secondary cancer diagnosis, and experts have since attributed Gawler's symptoms to advanced tuberculosis‚Äîwhich he also received medical treatment for at the time‚Äîrather than secondary bone cancer. =Sharyn Ainscough= In April 2011, Jessica's mother, Sharyn Ainscough, was diagnosed with breast cancer. Sharyn also refused all conventional treatment instead opting to join her daughter in Gerson Therapy. Sharyn Ainscough died in October 2013, two and half years after diagnosis, in line with expectations for untreated breast cancer. At the time of her death, it was widely reported that \\"Sharyn, followed her daughter in advocating Gerson therapy after being diagnosed with breast cancer\\". Death In December 2014, Ainscough wrote in her blog that she had returned to conventional medical care to treat a large fungating tumor under her left shoulder that had been bleeding non-stop for ten months, leaving her weak and uncomfortable. Under the care of an oncologist, Ainscough received six weeks of radiation therapy in the final weeks of her life. Responding to Ainscough's death Professor John Dwyer of Friends of Science in Medicine warned of the risk of bowel perforation associated with coffee enemas and said: \\"There is no credible scientific evidence for any of these alternative treatments that claim to cure cancer,\\" adding that \\"it can be difficult for people to tell what claims are unscientific and what are not\\". Whether Ainscough ever directly claimed to have cured her cancer is difficult to ascertain, as her blog \\"The Wellness Warrior\\", with 1.5 million followers, has been deleted. However, examples of Ainscough alluding to Gerson Therapy successfully treating her cancer can be found. In an article titled \\"I'm healing myself from cancer naturally\\" written by Ainscough for the teen magazine she once edited, Ainscough wrote: \\"I am ecstatic to report that it has worked for me. I have had no cancer spread, no more lumps pop up (they were popping up rapidly before) and I can actually see some of my tumors coming out through my skin and disappearing'\\" It was reported that Ainscough earned a \\"six figures\\" income from the \\"Wellness Warrior\\" brand.

After each shooting, the gunmen committed suicide. Both incidents led South Korea to immediate adoption of GPS monitoring of firearms. Since the rarity of shooting incidents in South Korea are evident, they garner international news coverage; the two unrelated spree shootings were widely reported as was the adoption of the gun control measure. Shootings At 8 a.m. in the morning of 25 February (23:00 GMT Tuesday), in Sejong, South Korea's administrative capital, a gunman shot and killed three people at a convenience store, then committed suicide at another location. The three victims were the gunman's ex-girlfriend's father, brother, and current boyfriend. Keeping a gun in the home in South Korea is restricted; the shooter checked out two shotguns from a police precinct two hours before. On 27 February, another shooting occurred in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi, South Korea, where an elderly man shot and killed three people‚Äîhis brother, his sister-in-law, and a policeman‚Äîand injured another police officer before committing suicide. He had checked out a hunting rifle at a police station before driving to his brother's house. A niece of the gunman was injured jumping from a second-story window to escape. The incident caused South Korea's Yonhap News Agency to criticize the nation's gun control regulations for hunting weapons, and led immediately to gun control regulation changes. On March 2, the first business day following the Friday incident, South Korea's National Emergency Management Agency, its National Police Agency, and the ruling Saenuri Party agreed to require GPS monitoring of guns in the nation.

History  The edifice was designed and built in 1891-1892 by the architect Carl Meyer from Bromberg for his own use; he lived in the city from 1885 to 1913. At the time of its erection, the tenement was located at Danzigerstra√üe 138. Carl Meyer built several other edifices in downtown Bydgoszcz, among others: * House at Cieszkowski Street6; * Bydgoszcz Water supply station, along with architect Marshall. After Meyer's departure, during the interwar period, the building housed the Scientific Society of Physicians () from 1913 to 1923.

The Egyptian Interior Ministry confirmed the arrest and said the journalists were accused of reporting false news which was \\"damaging to national security\\". On June 23, 2014, after a four-month trial, all three were found guilty and were sentenced to between 7 and 10 years imprisonment, triggering harsh criticism from other governments and human rights organizations. A day later, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared that he would not interfere with judicial rulings. In February 2015, Greste was released from prison and deported back to Australia via Cyprus, while the other two journalists were released on bail, pending a new trial. After the retrial, the reporters were again found guilty and sentenced between 3 and 3.5 years imprisonment. A month later, they were released from prison following a presidential pardon issued by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/al-jazeera- journalists-pardoned-egypt-150923112113189.html  2013 arrest  Peter Greste in 2012 Australian journalist Peter Greste and his colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were arrested on 29 December 2013 at the Cairo Marriott Hotel after the police conducted a raid at their room, which was used as their makeshift news studio. The Egyptian Interior Ministry confirmed the arrest and said the journalists were accused of reporting false news which was \\"damaging to national security\\". Following their arrest, Greste and his colleagues were imprisoned in Egypt in solitary confinement for a month before any formal charges were made. On 29 January 2014, it emerged that the Egyptian authorities were to charge 20 journalists belonging to Al Jazeera, including Greste, of falsifying news and having a negative impact on overseas perceptions of the country. On the same day, all three were charged with: * Being members of a terrorist organisation, as the Egyptian government has designated the Muslim Brotherhood on December 25, 2013 * Aiding and funding the group * Broadcasting false news and reports of civil strife in Egypt * Operating without licenses The three men were being held in the same cell in early February 2014. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the authorities in Egypt to \\"promptly release\\" the Al Jazeera staff.  2014 trial and sentencing  On 21 February 2014, Greste was denied bail and had his court case adjourned until 5 March 2014. On 31 March 2014, he and co- defendants Mohammed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed made a request to a judge during a hearing to be released. During the hearing Greste told the judge: \\"The idea that I could have an association with the Muslim Brotherhood is frankly preposterous.\\" On paper, Fahmy has been described as the \\"ring-leader\\" of the \\"terrorist cell\\". Hundreds of so-called fabricated videos considered as evidence confiscated from the Al Jazeera English hard-disk were listed against him personally. Most of these allegedly fabricated videos were filmed in the past three years before Fahmy worked for Al Jazeera when he was still reporting for CNN in Cairo. The investigation states that he prepared a \\"media center\\" in the hotel where he held meetings with Muslim Brotherhood leaders and recruited students to gather news. But Fahmy testified in court that he was personally a liberal who marched as a private citizen in protests to support President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi against the Muslim Brotherhood. Prominent Egyptian figures like Amr Moussa, the former head of the Arab League, and telecommunication mogul and billionaire Naguib Sawiris attested to Fahmy's integrity in court and confirmed he has no affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood. Egyptian scientist Farouk El-Baz who worked on the United States space program also supported Fahmy in a letter submitted to the judge. Mr. Sawiris even took his fury further and released a video calling on Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to release Fahmy. Mohamed Fahmy's international lawyer Amal Clooney, hired in his own capacity and not through Al Jazeera Media Network, called the judicial process a \\"show-trial\\" in her Huffington Post Article \\"The Anatomy of an Unfair Trial\\". She released several statements calling on the Egyptians to release her client and urged the Qatari government and Al Jazeera to take positive steps to support his freedom and refrain from actions that hinder his cause. On 23 June 2014, all three were found guilty of the charges against them. Greste and Fahmy were sentenced to seven years imprisonment. Mohamed received a sentence of seven years imprisonment plus an additional three years for bullet possession which he picked up during a demonstration. International reaction was swift and negative. US Secretary of State John Kerry was highly critical of the sentences of Greste and his co- workers, terming them \\"chilling and draconian\\" and noted he had spoken to Egyptian governmental officials including President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. Al- Sisi however was unmoved. A day after the trial, and amidst the widespread international condemnation, the Egyptian president declared that he would not interfere with judicial rulings. Greste and his colleagues were seen internationally as political prisoners due to the nature of the trial, the lack of applicable evidence presented and the sentences. Eleven defendants tried in absentia, including three foreign journalists, received 10-year sentences. =International reactions to the 2014 verdict= Non- governmental organisations *Human Rights Watch called the trial a ‚Äúmiscarriage of justice based on zero evidence‚Äù. *PEN American Center criticized the ruling and stated: ‚ÄúThe conviction, drawing on a trial devoid of any credible evidence against the accused, demonstrates a blatant disregard for the universally guaranteed right to free expression.‚Äù By country *: Australian Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop said that she was \\"bitterly disappointed\\" by the outcome. *: British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was \\"completely appalled\\" and the UK Foreign Office has summoned the Egyptian ambassador in London over the guilty verdicts. Two of the journalists convicted in absentia are also British. *: Secretary of State John Kerry was highly critical of the sentences of Greste and his co-workers, terming them \\"chilling and draconian\\" and noted he had spoken to Egyptian governmental officials including President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi.  2015 re-trial and sentencing  The trio stood trial on January 1, 2015, before the Cairo Court Of Cassation. The court ordered a retrial for Fahmy and his two colleagues, while keeping them in custody as their request to release on bail was denied. On 29 August 2015 - after a 9-month-long trial, Fahmy was sentenced to three years in prison, Mohamed was sentenced to 3-and-a-half years in prison and fined E¬£5,000 ($640), and Greste was sentenced in absentia to three years in prison at a sentencing hearing in Cairo. Following the verdict, Judge Hassan Farid said the accused broadcast \\"false news ... with the aim of harming the country\\". From his home country of Australia, Greste said he would be unable to travel to Egypt or any country with an extradition treaty with Egypt if an international arrest warrant for him was issued. Furthermore, Greste said in a tweet that he was \\"shocked\\" and \\"outraged\\" about the verdict. =International reactions to the 2015 verdict= Non-governmental organisations *Amnesty International called the verdict \\"farcical\\" and urged the Egyptian judiciary to overturn it. By country *: Australian Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop said that she was \\"dismayed by the decision\\" and adding that she \\"will continue to pursue all diplomatic avenues\\" to overturn the sentence. :* Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten condemned the verdict and added that he stands in solidarity with imprisoned journalists in Egypt and rest of the world. *: The Canadian government condemned the verdict as \\"disappointing\\". Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper tweeted that Canada continues to call on Egypt for the immediate and full release of Mr. Fahmy, and full co- operation to facilitate his return home. Leader of the Opposition, Thomas Mulcair condemned the verdict and has called for Prime Minister Harper to seek a guarantee from Egyptian President al-Sisi that Mohamed Fahmy will be pardoned & returned to Canada = Release = On February 1, 2015, Greste was deported to Australia via Cyprus. The presidential decree that allows the deportation of foreigners stipulates that they face prison or trial in their home country, but Australia is unlikely to uphold Greste's conviction.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/world/africa/egypt-releases-and- deportsal-jazeera-journalist-from-australia.html?_r=0 Otherwise, no explanation was given for his release.Greste released and deported Two days later, Fahmy renounced his Egyptian citizenship so he could be deported to Canada. His request was still pending at the time of the sentencing in August. On February 12, Fahmy and Mohamed were released on bail of E¬£250,000 ($33,000) with strict conditions. After the judge handed down sentences in August, they were taken back into custody. Fahmy's lawyer, Amal Clooney, said she would meet with Egyptian government officials to ask for her client to be deported to Canada. On September 23, 2015, Fahmy and Mohamed were released from prison after Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi issued a pardon on 100 activists including the Al Jazeera journalists, which was announced on his Facebook page. This marks the occasion of Eid al-Adha and the President's visit to the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly which will take place later this week. The Al Jazeera Media Network has welcomed their release but continues to demand all charges and sentences against its journalists are dropped. After release Fahmy traveled back to Canada where he took a role as a journalist in residence at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Honours  On February 19, 2015, the three detained reporters won a special Royal Television Society award for their sacrifices to journalism. Greste accepted the award in London for the three.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2015/02/al-jazeera-awarded-british- television-prize-150219045105924.html  Lawsuit against Al Jazeera  On May 5, 2015, Mohamed Fahmy filed a lawsuit against Al Jazeera for C$100 million (US$75.3 million) in punitive and remedial damages for alleged negligence and breach of contract. He accused the network of \\"negligence\\" by misinforming him about its legal status and their safety in Egypt.

His murder by J√∂rg Jenatsch marked a key Protestant (and anti- Habsburg) uprising in Graub√ºnden during the Thirty Years War. Life Pompeius studied in Basel and converted to Catholicism after graduation. As a member of the important Planta family, he soon found himself in high office: in 1614 he was bailiff of the Bishopric of Chur in F√ºrstenau, as well as Hereditary Marshal. He married Catharina von Salis, the daughter of the Governor-General of the Valtellina. Together with his older brother Rudolf, he led the movement for the Three Leagues to support the Austro-Spanish party. In 1618, his opponents of the Franco-Venetian Party outlawed the Planta brothers and sentenced them to death. On 25 February 1621, Pompeius was murdered in the presence of his daughter Lucretia at Rietberg Castle in Domleschg by a group led by his opponent J√∂rg Jenatsch. Planta had allegedly hidden with his dog above the fireplace in the tower, where the whining of the dog gave his position away. According to tradition, his heart was removed from his body. Pompeius Planta is probably the most famous of all the Planta clan, because he and his daughter Lucretia Catharina were immortalised in Conrad Ferdinand Meyer's popular 1876 novel J√ºrg Jenatsch.

It presently is used by the plantation as a polling station and meeting place. The school was named for Louis J. Brann, who was Governor of Maine at the time of its construction in 1934. It is the best-preserved of the community's former district school buildings; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Brann School is set on the east side of United States Route 1, just south of its junction with Laplante Road. It is a small wood-frame structure with Craftsman styling. It is finished in wood shingles and has a hip roof. A shed-roof addition extends from the center of the northern facade. The main facade faces west, and is three bays wide, a pair of sash windows flanking the center entrance. The entrance is sheltered by a gable-roofed portico, supported by both large brackets and a pair of square posts. The porch roof, like that of the building, has exposed rafter ends in the Craftsman style. The interior of the main block is a single room, with small closets on either side of the entrance, and doorways leading the northern addition, which originally housed pit toilets. The interior is finished in tongue-and-groove woodwork with a chair rail. Cyr Plantation was incorporated in 1870. The Governor Brann School, built in 1934, was the third built by the community for its third district. Due to declining population and school enrollment, the community closed three of its six schools in 1943, and the rest were closed in 1950, when its schools were consolidated with those of neighboring Van Buren. The design of this school was based on one of a series of plans developed by the Portland architectural firm Miller & Mayo pursuant to a state contract for designing model schools under a 1909 state law intended to improve the state's rural schools. This school building is one of a number of rural schools in the state built according to the same design.

The center was founded in April 1990 as the Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering with a grant from the Engineering Research Centers (ERC) program of the National Science Foundation (NSF). The CBE integrates faculty from multiple university departments to lead multidisciplinary research teams‚Äîincluding graduate and undergraduate students‚Äîto advance fundamental biofilm knowledge, develop beneficial uses for microbial biofilms, and find solutions to industrially relevant biofilm problems. The center tackles biofilm issues including chronic wounds, bioremediation, and microbial corrosion through cross-disciplinary research and education among engineers, microbiologists and industry. History The center originated as the Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (IPA) in 1983. In 1990, the center became a national ERC as the Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering based on a $7.2 million grant from the NSF. In 1993 the center assumed its current name-Center for Biofilm Engineering. The original grants expired in 2001 and the center became self-sufficient. The center is celebrating its 30th anniversary as an NSF ERC throughout 2020. =Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (1979‚Äì1990)= In 1979 W.G. (Bill) Characklis came to Montana State University from Rice University as a professor in civil (environmental) and chemical engineering. He assembled a multidisciplinary team of engineers, microbiologists and chemists to study the processes and effects of microbial growth at interfaces He established a cross-disciplinary environmental biotechnology institute to address the needs of industry in the areas of biofouling, microbial corrosion and biofilm technology. The Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (IPA) was chartered by the Montana Board of Regents in 1983 within the Montana State University College of Engineering. Bill Characklis was its first director. The IPA provided the foundation for eventual Engineering Research Center status in several ways. The IPA conducted fundamental research, development, and testing for industry and government agencies and it pursued biofilm projects that crossed traditional scientific discipline boundaries.Brochure: \\"Montana State University introduces The Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis.\\" 1983 The IPA established an Industrial Associates membership program and by 1989 the program had 12 participating members, each contributing $10,000 annually to the center. Membership benefits provided them the opportunity to assist in critiquing and defining the IPA research programs. Members included oil/gas/power companies, a chemical manufacturer, a pulp and paper company and partnership with the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.Report: \\"Strategic Plan of the Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis.\\" February 1989, p 50. =Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering (1990‚Äì1993)= confocal microscope systems In 1989, the IPA applied to the NSF for Engineering Research Center status, which was granted in April 1990. The Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering was established as one of three national Engineering Research Centers out of 48 applicants. As an ERC, the new organization was charged with building a cross-disciplinary research and education program at Montana State University, as well as increasing U.S. industrial competitiveness in biofilm related technologies. The center's charter mandated that research, education, and technology transfer programs would be fully integrated within the center's program planning. The Industrial Associates program continued to be used as a mechanism for the center to get information from industry about significant biofilm-related problems and collaborate on center research initiatives designed to address biofilm issues. The center's education program recruited students to participate on interdisciplinary research teams and to interact with industry representatives. The provision of $7.2 million in grants from the NSF during the first five years enabled the expansion of center research into new areas, notably bioremediation and biohydrometallurgy. The center's industrial focus expanded from biofilm control and mitigation to include positive use of biofilm processes to break up soil and water contaminants as well as extracting minerals from low-grade ores. Center projects were designed to span scales of inquiry from fundamental bench-scale to applied field-scale experiments. These projects enabled the continued development of microsensors to measure gradients of gases and pH within biofilm communities, microscopy to elucidate physiological activity of community organisms and modeling to predict biofilm behavior. =Center for Biofilm Engineering (1993‚Äìpresent)= In 1992, two years after its establishment, the center's first director, Bill Characklis, died. Montana State University signaled its commitment to the center by hiring J.W. (Bill) Costerton, a professor of microbiology from the University of Calgary, as Executive Director and James Bryers, a professor of biochemical engineering from Duke University, as Director of Research for the center. In 1993 the center's name was changed to Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE).Center for Biofilm Engineering News, 1993 April;1(1):1-3. Under Costerton's direction the center continued to fulfill its charter and began expanding its scope of inquiry. Costerton encouraged exploration of the bioelectric effect, the phenomenon of cell-cell signaling and its relation to biofilm structure and subsurface biobarrier technologies to protect water and soils from mining contamination. Industrial interest and membership grew in response to more diversified research topics. By 1996 Industrial Associate membership had grown to 19 diversified members including members representing water treatment, mining, government labs, specialty chemicals, consumer products, and oil/energy companies.Center for Biofilm Engineering Year Seven Report and Renewal Proposal, February 1997; Table 9.3. In June 1996 the National Science Foundation renewed its commitment to the Center for Biofilm Engineering with a new five year grant of $7.6 million. In 1996 the national profile of the CBE and biofilm research was on the rise. Numerous scientific and mass media publications began to address biofilm technology in earnest. An article in the September 1996 issue of Science, entitled \\"Biofilms Invade Microbiology\\" featured the work and history of the Center for Biofilm Engineering. Other magazines and newspapers featuring biofilms and CBE research included New Scientist (cover article, August 31, 1996), Science News (April 26, 1997), the Chicago Sun-Times (May 17, 1998), Science (March 19, 1999), Businessweek (September 12, 1999), Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service (January 7, 2000), Nature (November 16, 2000) and The Boston Globe (May 28, 2002). In 2001 Costerton and CBE Deputy Director Philip S. Stewart authored a biofilm article \\"Battling Biofilms\\" published in Scientific American (July 1, 2001) =Self-sufficiency (2001‚Äì)= The NSF ERC program was designed to create institutional centers that would be self-sufficient within ten years. The Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University started planning for self-sufficiency in 1998 through the establishment of a Self- sufficiency Task Force at the university. The center achieved self-sufficiency in 2001 and continues to be funded in part through federal and private grants with continued emphasis on providing value to the Industrial Associates, and support from Montana State University and the State of Montana.Center for Biofilm Engineering Final Report. February 2001. p15. In 2005 Philip S. Stewart, a professor of chemical and biological engineering, was selected to be the third CBE Director. Stewart, who had participated as a CBE faculty member since 1991, was a leading expert on antimicrobials and biofilm control. Under Stewart's tenure, CBE grew in affiliated faculty numbers, industrial membership, the number of testing and industry-sponsored projects, and the participation of undergraduate and graduate students. Matthew Fields became the fourth director of the CBE in 2015. In FY2019, research grants awarded were $2.54 million. The center is one of 24 self-sustaining Engineering Research Centers in the National Science Foundation program. Programs =Research program= Anaerobic experiment station The center's biofilm research program was established in the 1980s with a focus on environmental bioengineering, interdisciplinary investigation, and industrial participation. Faculty expertise from civil/environmental engineering, mathematics, microbiology, chemical and biological engineering, chemistry and biochemistry, mechanical and industrial engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, and statistics contributes to hypothesis development and experimental design. The center conducts research that includes multiple scales of observation, from molecular to industrial field-scale, with projects that cover both fundamental and applied topics. CBE research teams have been part of numerous groundbreaking advances in biofilm science and technology including: quorum sensing, permeability (earth sciences), biomineralization, antimicrobial tolerance, viscoelasticity, detachment, standardized biofilm methods, chronic wounds, algae fuel, microbial corrosion, sulfate-reducing bacteria, and biofilm structure and function. CBE research has been published in high-profile peer-reviewed journals including: Nature, The Lancet, Science, JAMA, PNAS, EMBO Journal, ISME Journal, Nature Reviews Microbiology and Physical Review Letters. By 2018, CBE authors had published 1,242 peer- reviewed papers. More than 20 of the center's biofilm-related images have appeared on the covers of peer-reviewed journals. Applied research topics addressed by the center in 2019 included: * Biofilm control strategies (antimicrobial efficacy, biocides, bioactive compounds, disinfectant efficacy) * Energy solutions (biofuels, coalbed methane production, microbial fuel cells) * Environmental technologies (bioremediation, wetlands, biomineralization, mining, carbon sequestration) * Health/medical biofilms (chronic wounds, catheter infections, oral health) * Industrial systems and processes (biofouling, microbial corrosion, product contamination) * Standardized methods (product claims, regulatory issues, ASTM methods development) * Water systems (drinking water quality, premise plumbing, water treatment, distribution systems) Other research topics in 2019 included: * Microbial communities in hot (Yellowstone National Park) and cold (Antarctica) environments * Ecology/physiology * Mathematical modeling of microbial processes and activities * Metabolic systems analysis * Magnetic resonance imaging studies of the effect of biofilm on flow * Microfluidics * Microrheology The center's standing in the international research community and its encouragement of collaboration regularly attracts visiting students and faculty from numerous institutions in the U.S. and foreign countries. From 1990 to 2019, 315 visiting researchers from more than 30 countries and 38 U.S. states spent from several weeks to a year or more studying biofilms in CBE laboratories. In 2019, 12 visiting scientists and engineers conducted research at CBE. =Industry programs= The center's Industrial Associates program provides access to center information, expertise, training and other benefits for a yearly subscription fee. The program was started in 1983 with the creation of the Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis. CBE's Standardized Biofilm Methods research group (SBM) focuses on issues of interest to companies developing new products addressing biofilm formation. Researchers develop, refine, and publish quantitative methods for growing, treating, sampling, and analyzing biofilm bacteria. SBM laboratory members work with international standard-setting organizations to secure approval of biofilm methods by the standard-setting community. Under a contract with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the SBM conducts laboratory research to support the development and standardization of test methods for measuring the performance of antimicrobial products‚Äîincluding those for biofilm bacteria‚Äîand provide statistical services related to EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs Antimicrobial Testing Program. The CBE developed the anti-microbial testing standards adopted in 2018 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The standards are the first to apply specifically to bacterial biofilms. The standards are an outgrowth of research by CBE faculty member Darla Goeres, an associate research professor of chemical and biological engineering. The standards provide a certification framework for companies to verify that their products are effective against biofilm bacteria and to label them accordingly, with a statement similar to the ‚ÄúKills 99.9% of bacteria‚Äù found on bottles of bleach and other cleaners. According to CBE biostatistician Al Parker, antimicrobial manufacturers are eager to attain the certification because of growing awareness about bacterial biofilms. Public health entities such as hospitals ‚Äî which routinely sterilize medical equipment such as surgical devices ‚Äî are particularly interested, he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a paradigm shift,‚Äù said Parker, whose statistical analysis played a central role in shaping the testing framework. thumb In 2013 CBE Director Phil Stewart and CBE Industrial Coordinator Paul Sturman worked to partner with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to co-sponsor a one-day workshop on biofilms. The resulting workshop, \\"Biofilms, Medical Devices and Anti-Biofilm Technology: Challenges and Opportunities,\\" was held on the FDA White Oak campus on February 20, 2014. A follow-up CBE-hosted meeting on February 11, 2015 in College Park, Maryland, titled \\"Anti-Biofilm Technologies: Pathways to Productivity\\" was held to continue fostering scientific dialog between U.S. government agencies, industry and academia. Member companies have represented several industrial categories including energy/petroleum, chemicals/specialty chemicals, household/consumer products, medical/healthcare, testing laboratories, government laboratories, water, pulp and paper, and mining. Members range from large Fortune 500 international corporations to small start-up companies. = Education program= The Microscopy Facility at the Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University. Graduate and undergraduate students participate in collaborative, interdisciplinary research at the center. Students work under the guidance of multidisciplinary faculty to solve problems associated with biofilms in medical, industrial, and environmental contexts. Faculty and students from the following MSU departments and programs participated in the center's research from 2011 to 2019. * Chemical and Biological Engineering * Chemistry & Biochemistry * Civil & Environmental Engineering * Ecology * Land Resources & Environmental Sciences * Material Sciences * Mathematical Sciences * Mechanical & Industrial Engineering * Microbiology & Immunology * Modern Languages & Literature Undergraduate studies The Center for Biofilm Engineering's Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) was founded by Director J.W. (Bill) Costerton and Ryan Jordan in the late 1990s. PhD candidate (and subsequent Senior Research Engineer at the CBE) Jordan directed the CBE's first URE students as part of a backcountry water quality program in Yellowstone National Park and the Bridger-Teton Wilderness where URE students under Jordan's direction became the first researchers to identify the role of biofilm in the failure of portable water treatment filters used in disaster relief, military, and outdoor recreation applications. Undergraduate students are hired as undergraduate research assistants and work in CBE laboratories as members of research teams on interdisciplinary biofilm projects. CBE undergraduates are encouraged to acquire competence in laboratory skills, experimental design and group communication. By 2019, 894 undergraduates from 11 disciplines had worked on laboratory biofilm projects under the direction of CBE-affiliated faculty members. Thirty-two of 49 undergraduates (63%) in the 2018-19 academic year were female. Graduate studies Graduate students pursue their degree in a discipline offered through one of the science, agriculture, or engineering departments at Montana State University while they conduct their research in CBE laboratories. Student graduate committees are typically interdisciplinary. The student and graduate committee members select coursework appropriate for the student's interests and degree program. Engineering students are encouraged to take microbiology courses; science students are encouraged to take relevant engineering coursework. Graduate students acquire experience by designing and performing research that crosses traditional academic discipline boundaries and has direct impact on current environmental, industrial, and medical issues. Students work on projects that range from fundamental to applied topics. In addition, the CBE's Industrial Associates program brings students into working relationships with potential employers. Graduate students are encouraged to develop their communication and leadership skills by presenting at research conferences, mentoring undergraduate students, organizing the CBE's seminar series, and assisting with outreach efforts. By the end of 2018, 266 graduate students had received advanced degrees, including 105 with doctorate degrees and 161 with master's degrees. During the 2018-19 academic year 39% graduate students were female.

Built in 1916 for Otis Ward Hinckley, a Chicago businessman with roots in Blue Hill, it is one of only two documented examples of the Prairie School of architecture in the state of Maine. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The Willits House in Highland Park, Illinois, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and built in 1901. The Hinckley House is based on this work. The Hinckley House is set on the coast of Blue Hill Harbor, an inlet of the Mount Desert Narrows, the body of water separating Blue Hill from Mount Desert Island. It is a two-story building with a hip roof that has extended eaves, and a long single-story projecting section on one side. It has groups of diamond-paned windows and a stuccoed exterior. The house was built in 1916 for Otis Ward Hinckley, a Chicago businessman who was part owner of the Hinckley & Schmitt bottling company, and whose ancestors included Blue Hill native Rev. Jonathan Fisher. Hinckley was said to be aware of Frank Lloyd Wright's design work, and sought his services to design the house, but balked at Wright's price. Instead he hired his nephew Wallace Hinckley, who created this design based on Wright's Willits House in Highland Park, Illinois. The house remains in private ownership.

The company makes high-efficiency loudspeakers, power amplifiers, pre- amplifiers, integrated amplifiers, and audio processing software. Daniel Hertz provides consulting services to major companies like LG Electronics of Korea and semiconductor firm Intersil (Milpitas, CA, USA). Daniel Hertz was founded in 2007 by audio industry legend Mark Levinson, a multi-instrumentalist, recording and mastering engineer, equipment designer and serial entrepreneur. Levinson previously founded Mark Levinson Audio Systems, Cello Ltd. and Red Rose Music. The company name combines the given name of Levinson's father with his mother's family name. His father Daniel Levinson was a professor of psychology at Yale University, his mother Maria is a grandniece of German physicist Heinrich Hertz, for whom the scientific unit for cycles-per-second is named. It can be said that Hertz demonstrations were the beginning of audio. Loudspeakers from Daniel Hertz are noted for high sensitivity (the flagship bi-amplified M1 model is rated at 100 dB/1W/1M), natural sound and elegant design, with the ability to reproduce the recording as fully and faithfully as possible. Daniel Hertz amplifiers are similarly designed for natural sound and dynamics, with special attention paid to the milliwatt region, the power range where most of the music occurs in typical playback situations with high-sensitivity loudspeakers. Daniel Hertz \\"Master Class\\" audio processing software (for use with Apple computers) provides more analog sound and feeling from digital sources, and allows the user to match the recordings to the system by a six-band equalizer (the digital version on the legendary Cello Audio Palette). Daniel Hertz position is that the recording is the most important part of the system and for the best result it should be fine tuned to play on the given playback system. Daniel Hertz launched production in 2010 with expensive flagship products including the M1 loudspeaker, M5 monoblock power amplifier, and M6 pre-amplifier with inboard digital-to-analog converter. The M2 speaker and M3 18‚Äù subwoofer are lifestyle products also for home theater applications. Recent additions to the line include the M11 four channel integrated amplifier and M4 loudspeaker for bi- amping application, the M7W wireless speaker, and more compact and affordable products like the M12 two channel amplifier and M15 coaxial speaker (August 2019).

It has been a hotel since 1799 and is therefore considered to be one of the oldest hotels in France.  Background and history  Hotel d'Europe in the 19th century Originally, the H√¥tel d‚ÄôEurope was a large private mansion built in the 16th century (1580). It belonged first to several noble families from the Comtat Venaissin. In 1740, the house was bought by Fran√ßois de Boutin de Valouse who carried out significant construction work and transformed the building. It then took on the look of a large h√¥tel particulier of Classical style. The architecture has barely been changed since then. In 1775, the building became the H√¥tel de Graveson when it was bought by Jean-Baptiste de Graveson. He was a direct descendant of Antoine d'Amat de Graveson, who, in 1652, married Marguerite de Crillon, granddaughter of Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon, for whom the Place Crillon in Avignon (where the hotel is located) was named. Facing the H√¥tel de Graveson, on the other side of Place Crillon, was the H√¥tel du Palais Royal which was owned by Claude Pierron and his wife Catherine. This is the hotel in which Napoleon‚Äôs Marechal Guillaume Brune would be assassinated in 1815. On September 25th 1799, when her husband died, Catherine Pierron bought the H√¥tel de Graveson and the same year converted it into a hotel, the H√¥tel d‚ÄôEurope. The H√¥tel d‚ÄôEurope rapidly established an excellent reputation, possibly thanks to Catherine Pierron‚Äôs natural sense of service, or to its beautiful and well-shaded courtyard or, perhaps, due to it being conveniently close to the River Rh√¥ne. In 1830, Catherine Pierron‚Äôs son, Narcisse, was married at the age of 47. His mother, who was then 74, bequeathed the hotel to him. He proved to be a dynamic and successful manager. 1854 was the year when the railway lines between Marseilles and Avignon and Paris and Avignon were opened. The train station was built on the other side of town, so the H√¥tel d‚ÄôEurope became farther from the center of town. Narcisse Pierron, who was then 71, decided to create his own omnibus line, which enabled his guests to come and go between the train station and the hotel. This was one of the first omnibus lines in Avignon. Marie-Rose, Narcisse‚Äôs daughter, took over after his death in 1855. She went on to manage the hotel, with her husband Emile Perre, until her own death in 1874. In 1884, the H√¥tel d‚ÄôEurope and Marie-Rose Perre‚Äôs possessions were sold at auction to one of her grandsons: Marie Joseph Narcisse Pierre. In 1904, the telephone was installed at the hotel. The H√¥tel d‚ÄôEurope was one of the first three hotels in Avignon to be connected by telephone. During World War II, the H√¥tel d‚ÄôEurope was requisitioned by the German army from November 19th, 1942 to August 23rd,1944. Famous guests from the past The courtyard of the H√¥tel d'Europe The first important guest to stay at the H√¥tel d‚ÄôEurope was General Bonaparte, on the way back to Paris from his campaign in Egypt in 1799. The next great man, in about 1820 was the Duke of Gloucester and Edingurgh and, then, from November 1822 to February 1823, Marguerite Power, the Countess of Blessington. In September 25 1839, Victor Hugo stayed at the H√¥tel d‚ÄôEurope with his mistress Juliette Drouet. The famous couple arrived from Lyon by boat and left two days later for Arles. And they stayed here again, a few days later, on their way home. In 1843, Cardinal Pecci, the future pope Leon XIII, stayed here, and, in 1850, the first Archbishop of Westminster, Nicholas Wiseman. In 1858, the economist John Stuart Mill and his wife Harriet Taylor Mill took up residence in the H√¥tel d‚ÄôEurope where she was to die on November 4th in that year. From November 1893 to February 1894, the composer Jules Massenet rented seven rooms in order to work on the musical score for La Navarraise. During his stay he met the Proven√ßal poet Felix Gras. In the 20th century, the H√¥tel d‚ÄôEurope welcomed the Count of Paris, Prince Rainier de Monaco, King Leopold III of Belgium, the King of Nepal Birenda Bir Bikram Dev Shah, the Aga Khan, Prince Ali Khan, Prince Umberto I of Italy and Archduke Otto von Habsburg. Other famous guests included Jean-Louis Vaudoyer, Vincent Auriol, the writers Blasco Ibanez, Jean Cocteau, Arthur Conan Doyle, Ernest Hemingway, Eug√®ne Ionesco, Somerset Maugham, Jules Romains, the painters Bernard Buffet, Salvador Dali, Kees van Dongen, Pablo Picasso, the actors and directors Bourvil, Charlie Chaplin, Gary Cooper, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Fernandel, Victor Francen, Louis de Fun√®s, Walt Disney, Ren√© Clair, Elvire Popesco, Orson Welles, the singers Georges Brassens, Edith Piaf and Tino Rossi, and many others, such as Christian Dior and Eleanor Roosevelt.

He has been living in exile in Canada since May 2017. Early life and education Al Jabri's father died when he was a boy in Ha'il. To support his family, he attended a police academy then worked as a police officer in Taif. Al Jabri obtained a bachelor's degree in Security Sciences from King Fahd Security College in Riyadh. Then he obtained another bachelor's degree in Arabic language and literature from Imam Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University, and a diploma in computer programming from the Institute of Public Administration in Riyadh. He also holds a master's degree in computer science from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in the late 1980s. Next he received a doctorate degree in artificial intelligence from the University of Edinburgh in 1997. Career Following the completion of his doctoral studies Al Jabri went, at the behest of then-minister of interior Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, to work within the ministry of interior where he taught at the King Fahd Security College. Over the following two decades Al Jabri became an ally and key adviser to Muhammad bin Nayef. He was a mainstay link between Saudi Arabia and western intelligence agencies, including the Five Eyes alliance, and was credited with helping Muhammad bin Nayef transform and modernise the Saudi security services and their counter-terrorism methods. As of 2003 Al Jabri was the chief of staff and following the Riyadh compound bombings their focus shifted to Al-Qaeda. Changes to counter-terrorism methods were introduced including rehabilitation programs and closer information sharing with western intelligence agencies. It is claimed the reforms were instrumental in the foiling of the 2010 transatlantic aircraft bomb plot. In July 2015, and with the agreement of then-minister of interior and Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, Al Jabri attended meetings with then-CIA Director John Brennan at CIA headquarters and British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond in London. The following month he visited the White House to discuss the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. Despite briefing the royal court upon his return it is claimed that Mohammed bin Salman felt Al Jabri was \\"plotting\\" with bin Nayef against him. He was dismissed from his governmental positions on 10 September 2015. Exile After his dismissal from government, Al Jabri continued advising Mohammed bin Nayef in a personal capacity until he departed Saudi Arabia on 17 May 2017. He remained abroad following the ousting of Muhammad bin Nayef as Crown Prince the following month and later took refuge in Canada. Thomas Juneau, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa, stated that Al Jabri and other Saudis who had fled the kingdom were justifiably concerned about their safety. Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst and director of the Brookings Intelligence Project, explained why Al Jabri kept a low profile after arriving in Canada: \\"I think he's scared. Wouldn't you be?\\" In September 2017, Al Jabri's son-in-law was allegedly rendered from Dubai to Saudi Arabia. His wife was in Turkey at the time and he tried to persuade her to attend the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul from where, Khalid al- Jabri suspects, she would have been abducted. On 16 March 2020 two of his children, Sarah and Omar, who were already barred from leaving the Kingdom, were detained by Saudi security officers. Their elder brother Khalid Al Jabri believes that they were to be used as bargaining chips to force their father to return to Saudi Arabia. Neither Sarah nor Omar have been heard from since they were taken and their current whereabouts are unknown. The family sought the assistance of the US authorities in their quest for information about the pair and Tim Rieser, a senior aide to Senator Patrick Leahy, confirmed that Leahy's office is pushing for both information about their location and their release. Rieser stated, \\"It seems that they‚Äôre being used as hostages to try and coerce their father to return to Saudi Arabia\\". In May 2020, Al Jabri's brother, Abdulrahman, was also detained. In June 2020, Lord Hylton, queried what steps the British government were taking over the arrests of Al Jabri's children and brother, he was duly advised that they are \\"monitoring this case closely\\" and are \\"concerned\\" about numerous detainees held by the Saudi government. On 7 July 2020, Senators Patrick Leahy, Tim Kaine, Chris Van Hollen and Marco Rubio wrote to President Donald Trump urging him to press for the release of Al Jabri's children. Calling him a \\"highly valued partner\\" they said: \\"the US has a moral obligation to do what it can to assist in securing his children's freedom\\". In response, the Department of State noted that it had \\"repeatedly\\" requested that Saudi officials \\"clarify the status\\" of Al Jabri's children, and undertook to: ‚Äúcontinue to engage Saudi counterparts to resolve this situation in a manner that honours Dr Aljabri‚Äôs service to our country\\". According to the lawsuit filed on 6 August 2020 against Saudi Arabia‚Äôs crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman by ex-Saudi intelligence official Saad Al Jabri, the ruler, during his tenure as the defense minister, encouraged Russia to intervene in Syria war, in support of Bassar Al Assad. =Allegations of corruption= In September 2017, Saudi authorities sought Al Jabri's arrest. According to Canadian newspaper, The Globe and Mail, an Interpol Red Notice was requested, whereas The New York Times, which claimed to have viewed relevant Interpol documentation, a less formal 'diffusion' was filed. According to Al Jabri's son, Khalid, the request was viewed as \\"politically motivated\\". Al-Jabri successfully petitioned to have his name removed from the Interpol system in July 2018, with the Commission noting ‚Äúthe lack of due process and human rights guarantees‚Äù in previous corruption cases. Despite having no extradition treaty with Canada, Saudi authorities have twice requested that Canada extradite Al Jabri; in 2018 and again in 2019. The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi officials claimed that Al Jabri is wanted over missing funds which were allegedly \\"misused\\" during his time in the interior ministry. In response to the claims his son, Khalid, stated that the family welcome impartial \\"due process that doesn't include attempts to induce harm or extortion through child hostage-taking.\\" Following the publication of the claims in The Wall Street Journal, Al Jabri was targeted by \\"pro- government\\" Twitter users, in response his son Khalid told Reuters that the campaign was a ‚Äúdeflection from the actual story: hostage taking of my brother and sister, unlawful persecution and false allegations‚Äù. =Assassination attempt= A few days after the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, Mohammad bin Salman attempted to send Tiger Squad to Canada to assassinate Al Jabri, according to a lawsuit filed under the Torture Victim Protection Act in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in August 2020. However, border agents at Toronto Pearson International Airport stopped the group and refused them entry into Canada. Described as an \\"active threat\\" by Canadian media, further claims of more recent attempts to kill Al Jabri have materialised, leading to him being guarded by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as well as private security. In response to the claims Bill Blair, Canada's Minister of Public Safety, stated: ‚Äúwe are aware of incidents which foreign actors have attempted to monitor, intimidate or threaten Canadians and those living in Canada [...] we will never tolerate foreign actors threatening Canada‚Äôs national security or the safety of our citizens and residents\\". Personal life Al Jabri is married to Nadyah and they have six sons and two daughters. In June 2020 the family reported that two of his children had been disappeared.

Origin  In 1856 Charles Hill started a private School of Art in Pulteney Street, where, in that same year, the South Australian Society of Arts was formed. In 1861 the South Australian School of Design was founded under the management of the Society of Arts and connected with the South Australian Institute, with Charles Hill in charge. In 1862 enrolments were low and decreasing, rising slightly to 21 students in 1863. From the beginning, students were encouraged to show their work at Society exhibitions, and special prizes were offered for members of the School. This led to much mediocre work being shown, but acted as an impetus to native talent. By 1868 there were three classes: girls, boys, and young men, with an average attendance of 25. The school moved into a larger hall at the Institute previously reserved as exhibition space, and the small schoolroom handed over to F. G. Waterhouse, curator of the Museum. A large consignment of busts and statues had been donated by the Royal Society to add to the plaster models already in use for drawing \\"in the round\\". Public Library, Art Gallery and Museum Charles Hill retired in 1881 and the Board of Governors decided to re-form the School into a School of Design and a School of Painting, and after recruitment for a replacement in England fell through, it was decided to appoint only one master in the first instance, and Eugene von Guerard of Melbourne recommended Louis Tannert, who started in October 1881, as head of the School of Design, later head of the School of Painting. H. P. Gill was appointed in London in 1882 as head of the School of Design. In 1887 G. A. Reynolds was brought in as first assistant; in 1891 he transferred to the Education Department. Tannert retired in 1892 and the two schools were reunited as the School of Design and Painting with Gill in charge. The syllabus was broadened with additional subjects, including china painting, under Rosa C. Fiveash. A Port Adelaide branch of the School of Design had been formed sometime before October 1893 and Gawler Sample work from students was sent to the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington for assessment, and students who had reached their standards of proficiency were awarded either the Art Class Teacher's Certificate, or Art Class Master's Certificate. Early in 1894 the School's title was changed to School of Design, Painting and Technical Art, and the school's ceramic kiln went into operation. The school occupied two floors and incorporated four large classrooms. Education Department In mid-1909 responsibility for the management of the School was handed over to the Education Department, and renamed Adelaide School of Art, but with no immediate change of function, courses or staff. Trainee teachers constituted a substantial proportion of its students. From 1910 to 1916 the school was housed in the Jubilee Exhibition Building, not a popular choice, as the building was not heated in winter. When during the 'flu epidemic of 1919 that building was turned into a nursing hospital and quarantine station, the school moved to the old Destitute Asylum on Kintore Avenue. Gill resigned in July 1915 after suffering ill-health for a year or so. He left Australia to return to England but died en route in May 1916. J. Christie Wright was appointed his replacement, commencing in February 1916, and set about reorganising it as the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts. He enlisted with the First AIF on 13 April 1916, with the assurance of being re-hired on his safe return, and his responsibilities were shared by C. J. Pavia, who handled administrative duties and Geometrical Drawing and Fred C. Britton in charge of all other subjects. Wright was killed in France in 1917. Britton left in 1918 to work as a war artist and Pavia acted as principal for around three years. L. H. Howie returned from his wartime duties in 1920 and was appointed to the position, retiring in 1941. John Goodchild took over, and was appointed to the post in 1944, but left the following year to act as War Artist for the RAAF. F. Millward Grey was his temporary replacement, made permanent in 1946, serving until 1956. Ken LamacraftKenneth Ronald Ross Lamacraft (1912‚Äì1996), whose parents were prominent Scout leaders, was educated at Unley High School and the School of Arts and Crafts, then taught at Thebarton and Goodwood Boys' Technical Schools. was the next principal, then Douglas Roberts 1957‚Äì1958 (in which year the school's title changed yet again, to South Australian School of Art), Paul Beadle followed 1958‚Äì1960, then Allan Sierp 1961‚Äì1964 then Douglas Roberts again, from 1964.

Her 1943 photos of Jewish and non-Jewish children and adults, taken in Amsterdam, were rediscovered in 2008 by Dutch photo historian Simon Kool. About 3000 photos were taken of 440 persons, and about 300 of the subjects have been identified in November 2016. About 50% of the photos' Jewish subjects perished in the Nazi concentration camps, while the others survived World War II.

They opened a photography studio in the \\"Rivierenbuurt\\", an area of south Amsterdam where many German refugees settled. They founded photography magazine Kleinbeeldfoto, released several international photo stories and in 1939 organized an exhibit with pictures taken by subscribers to the magazine. Prince Bernhard was among the subscribers, presenting pictures of baby Princess Beatrix, later Queen of the Netherlands. Their main photography assignments came from the Amsterdam Port Authority and Schiphol Airport. In May 1940, upon the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands, they attempted to carry out a suicide pact; Helmuth died but Annemie survived. In 1943, she continued her portrait work in her studio. After the war she produced publicity photographs for the Amsterdam harbor and other clients. Later research by Dutch photo historian Simon Kool revealed that Annemie was a member of the Dutch resistance group 'De ondergedoken Camera'. In her later years, however, she rarely spoke about her work during the war period.

Synopsis This film is about the journey of Kheya, a theatre artist and her multi-dimensional experience as a girl, as a woman and even as an artist. It is more so when especially a woman is of maverick capability and of excellence beyond her time. While the film depicts the scenario of Kolkata's socio-cultural circuit spanning from 1950 to 1970s, it aspires to bring about the struggles and conflicts that a female artist has to go through even after two decades of globalization. The film, through an investigation of sudden demise of an extremely reputed actress‚Äô death delves into an ongoing search behind the causes of ceaseless conflicts a female artist has to confront and is made to remain submissive in the paradigm of male domination. The film intends to get into precise details of the artist's life so as to expose the obstructions, understand the strength of creative aspirations, and to ablaze with the delightful journey of the artistic soul that unfortunately got cut short. However, this film is envisaged to be in coherence with the belief in the unending journey of the artist who still remains alive with the lively river and the living art.

The point of the attack is to target the operating system that is below that of the virtual machines so that the attacker's program can run and the applications on the VMs above it will be completely oblivious to its presence.  Overview  Hyperjacking Hyperjacking involves installing a malicious, fake hypervisor that can manage the entire server system. Regular security measures are ineffective because the operating system will not be aware that the machine has been compromised. In hyperjacking, the hypervisor specifically operates in stealth mode and runs beneath the machine, it makes more difficult to detect and more likely gain access to computer servers where it can affect the operation of the entire institution or company. If the hacker gains access to the hypervisor, everything that is connected to that server can be manipulated. The hypervisor represents a single point of failure when it comes to the security and protection of sensitive information. For a hyperjacking attack to succeed, an attacker would have to take control of the hypervisor by the following methods: * Injecting a rogue hypervisor beneath the original hypervisor * Directly obtaining control of the original hypervisor * Running a rogue hypervisor on top of an existing hypervisor  Mitigation techniques  Some basic design features in a virtual environment can help mitigate the risks of hyperjacking: * Security management of the hypervisor must be kept separate from regular traffic. This is a more network related measure than hypervisor itself related. * Guest operating systems should never have access to the hypervisor. Management tools should not be installed or used from guest OS. * Regularly patching the hypervisor.  Known attacks  As of early 2015, there had not been any report of an actual demonstration of a successful hyperjacking besides \\"proof of concept\\" testing. The VENOM vulnerability () was revealed in May 2015 and had the potential to affect many datacenters. Hyperjackings are rare due to the difficulty of directly accessing hypervisors; however, hyperjacking is considered a real-world threat.

Goldin has completed secondary school in Vologda with a silver medal award. In the same year he has arrived on geophysical faculty of the Leningrad Mining Institute which has ended in 1958 with the high distinction. In the next three years he was employed in field geological parties in Kolpashevo, Surgut and Berezovo (all in Siberia), participated in the opening of an oil deposit near to Surgut. In 1961, S. Goldin has arrived in postgraduate study of Institute of geology and geophysics SB of AS USSR. Since 1964, he was the research assistant of the Institute. In 1966, he has defended the PhD thesis of physical and mathematical sciences on the theme of ¬´The Noise stability of algorithms of phase correlation of seismic waves against disturbances¬ª. In 1965, S. Goldin has lived to Tyumen and had headed to laboratory of mathematical processing of Western-Siberian scientifically - research geology- prospecting oil institute.

Being founded in 1938 it is one of the oldest magazines in the country. History and profile Billed Bladet was first published on 5 April 1938. The magazine was modelled on the American magazines Life and Look. Billed Bladet is part of Aller Media. The former owner of the magazine was Den Berlingske Gruppe. Aller Media acquired the magazine in 1987. It is published by Aller Press AS weekly and has its headquarters in Copenhagen. During its early period Billed Bladet had a much more comprehensive coverage and included more photographs. Immediately after World War II the magazine published the photographs of the Nazi concentration camps in Germany. Later it began to provide news on celebrities and royal families as well as on television programs, including Vild med dans (Denmark's Dancing with the Stars) and X-factor (Denmark's Got Talent). The weekly publishes a list of Dress of the Week. Its target audience is women over forty. Billed Bladet has high ethical standards in regard to the news it publishes.

These chains are held together by disulfide bonds. The arrangement or processes that put together different parts of this antibody molecule play important role in antibody diversity and production of different subclasses or classes of antibodies. The organization and processes take place during the development and differentiation of B cells. That is, the controlled gene expression during transcription and translation coupled with the rearrangements of immunoglobulin gene segments result in the generation of antibody repertoire during development and maturation of B cells.  B-Cell Development  During the development of B cells, the immunoglobulin gene undergoes sequences of rearrangements that lead to formation of the antibody repertoire. For example, in the lymphoid cell, a partial rearrangement of the heavy-chain gene occurs which is followed by complete rearrangement of heavy- chain gene. Here at this stage, Pre-B cell, mŒº heavy chain and surrogate light chain are formed. The final rearrangement of the light chain gene generates immature B cell and mIgM. The process explained here occurs only in the absence of the antigen. The mature B cell formed as RNA processing changes leaves the bone marrow and is stimulated by the antigen then differentiated into IgM -secreted plasma cells. Also at first, the mature B cell expresses membrane-bound IgD and IgM. These two classes could switch to secretory IgD and IgM during the processing of mRNAs. Finally, further class switching follows as the cell keep dividing and differentiating. For instance, IgM switches to IgG which switches to IgA that eventually switches to IgE  The multigene organization of immunoglobulin genes  From studies and predictions such as Dreyer and Bennett's, it shows that the light chains and heavy chains are encoded by separate multigene families on different chromosomes. They are referred to as gene segments and are separated by non-coding regions. The rearrangement and organization of these gene segments during the maturation of B cells produce functional proteins. The entire process of rearrangement and organization of these gene segments is the vital source where our body immune system gets its capabilities to recognize and respond to variety of antigens. = Light chain multigene family = The light chain gene has three gene segments. These include: the light chain variable region (V), joining region (J), and constant region (C) gene segments. The variable region of light is therefore encoded by the rearrangement of VJ segments. The light chain can be either kappa,Œ∫ or lambda,Œª. This process takes place at the level of mRNAs processing. Random rearrangements and recombinations of the gene segments at DNA level to form one kappa or lambda light chain occurs in an orderly fashion. As a result, \\"a functional variable region gene of a light chain contains two coding segments that are separated by a non-coding DNA sequence in unrearranged germ-line DNA\\" (Barbara et al., 2007). = Heavy-chain multigene family = Heavy chain contains similar gene segments such as VH, JH and CH, but also has another gene segment called D (diversity). Unlike the light chain multigene family, VDJ gene segments code for the variable region of the heavy chain. The rearrangement and reorganization of gene segments in this multigene family is more complex . The rearranging and joining of segments produced different end products because these are carried out by different RNA processes. The same reason is why the IgM and IgG are generates at the time.  Variable-Region Rearrangements  The variable region rearrangements happen in an orderly sequence in the bone marrow. Usually, the assortment of these gene segments occurs at B cell maturation.  Light chain DNA  The kappa and lambda light chains undergo rearrangements of the V and J gene segments. In this process, a functional Vlambda can combine with four functional JŒª ‚ÄìCŒª combinations. On the other hands, Vk gene segments can join with either one of the Jk functional gene segments. The overall rearrangements result in a gene segment order from 5 prime to 3 prime end. These are a short leader (L) exon, a noncoding sequence (intron), a joined VJ segment, a second intron, and the constant region. There is a promoter upstream from each leader gene segment. The leader exon is important in the transcription of light chain by the RNA polymerase. To remain with coding sequence only, the introns are removed during RNA- processing and repairing. In summary,  Heavy chain DNA  The rearrangements of heavy-chains are different from the light chains because DNA undergoes rearrangements of V-D-J gene segments in the heavy chains. These reorganizations of gene segments produce gene sequence from 5 prime to 3 prime ends such as a short leader exon, an intron, a joined VDJ segment, a second intron and several gene segments. The final product of the rearrangement is transcribed when RNA polymerase  Mechanism of variable region rearrangements  It is understood that rearrangement occurs between specific sites on the DNA called recombination signal sequences (RSSs). The signal sequences are composed of a conserved palindromic heptamer and a conserved AT- rich nonamer. These signal sequences are separated by non- conserved spacers of 12 or 23 base pairs called one-turn and two-turn respectively. They are within the lambda chain, k-chain and The processes of rearrangement in these regions are catalyzed by two recombination-activating genes: RAG-1 and RAG-2 and other enzymes and proteins. The segments joined due to signals generated RSSs that flank each V, D, and J segments. Only genes flank by 12 -bp that join to the genes flank by 23-bp spacer during the rearrangements and combinations to maintain VL-JL and VH-DH-JH joining.  Generation of antibody diversity  Antibody diversity is produced by genetic rearrangement after shuffling and rejoining one of each of the various gene segments for the heavy and light chains. Due to mixing and random recombination of the gene segments errors can occur at the sites where gene segments join with each other. These errors are one of the sources of the antibody diversity that is commonly observed in both the light and heavy chains. Moreover, when B cells continue to proliferate, mutations accumulate at the variable regions through a process called somatic hypermutation. The high concentrations of these mutations at the variable region also produce high antibody diversity.  Class-switching  When the B cells get activated, class switching can occur. The class switching involves switch regions that made up of multiple copies of short repeatts(GAGCT and TGGGG). These switches occur at the level of rearrangements of the DNA because there is a looping event that chops off the constant regions for IgM and IgD and form the IgG mRNAs. Any continuous looping occurrence will produce IgE or IgA mRNAs. In addition, cytokines are factors that have great effects on class switching of different classes of antibodies. Their interaction with B cells provides the appropriates signals needed for B cells differentiation and eventual class switching occurrence. For example, interleukin-4 induces the rearrangements of heavy chain immunoglobulin genes. That is IL- 4 induces the switching of CŒº to CŒ≥ to CŒ∫  References  Barbara, AO., Richard, AG., and Thomas, JK(2007) Kuby Immunology.

It first is confirmed to have appeared in a manuscript in 1410. For a long time it was attributed to Johannes Hus, but was more likely written by the Archbishop of Prague, Jan of Jen≈°tejn. Several hymns in different languages were derived from it, among others Martin Luther's \\"\\".  History  The earliest extant version of the hymn is contained in a 1410 manuscript from the Cistercian abbey of Hohenfurth (Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod Monastery). In that version, it has ten stanzas of four lines each, and a refrain of praise. The first eight stanzas form an acrostic on the name JOHANNES (John). Possibly the eight acrostic stanzas were a first version which was expanded by two more stanzas and the refrain. The hymn is in content comparable to the 13th century '. It is focused on the eucharist and the presence of Christ in bread and wine. According to modern research, the text was written by Jan of Jen≈°tejn, archbishop of Prague, in the late 14th century. A Czech language version of the hymn exists: this version probably originated in the 15th century. The melody of the hymn also appears in Hohenfurth 1410. The melody may go back to the 13th century. The hymn was sung and distributed by the Hussite Bohemian Brethren. During the Reformation, it was considered as a work of the early reformer and martyr Johannes Hus and was printed in collections of his works.

Early life Mills was born in Hampstead Garden Suburb, the son of British Army Colonel Kenneth Mills, who according to The Independent was a senior spy. At the end of the Second World War, Kenneth Mills was running MI5's operations from Gibraltar. Later, he was transferred to Jamaica and‚Äîaccording to a family legend‚Äîpersonally foiled an attempted revolution in Cuba. Mills' brother is lawyer David Mills, who was married to Dame Tessa Jowell, a former Labour Cabinet minister. Educated privately at Glenalmond College in Scotland, Mills then read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Merton College, Oxford. Searching for extra income as a student, he started selling household cleaning goods door-to-door, and in 1958 hired a plane to fly fellow students to Canada for summer jobs, making a profit by selling off the seats. After two years of National Service, he joined Unilever's graduate scheme, but quit after six months to start his own business. Charged by Trading Standards for selling brass trinkets as gold- plated jewellery, he pleaded guilty and was fined ¬£750.

Hindus are exist in comparatively smaller numbers. So the culture of the locality is based upon Muslim traditions. Duff Muttu, Kolkali and Aravanamuttu are common folk arts of this locality. There are many libraries attached to mosques giving a rich source of Islamic studies. Some of the books are written in Arabi-Malayalam which is a version of the Malayalam language written in Arabic script. People gather in mosques for the evening prayer and continue to sit there after the prayers discussing social and cultural issues. Business and family issues are also sorted out during these evening meetings. The Hindu minority of this area keeps their rich traditions by celebrating various festivals in their temples. Hindu rituals are done here with a regular devotion like other parts of Kerala. Transportation Pottippara village connects to other parts of India through Kottakkal town.

So little credible information exists about Jun that even its most basic characteristics are in dispute: some claim its true definition to be an exclusively anaerobic lactobacillus ferment, and others that it is similar to kombucha in including yeasts. The fermentation process requires a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) similar to that used to make kombucha. It is suggested that, in the absence of a definitive jun SCOBY, a kombucha SCOBY can be gradually adapted, but there is some debate about this. Among the characteristics of Jun known to include yeast: Like kombucha, it can achieve an alcohol content of 2‚Äì7%. Jun has faster brewing times of ~3‚Äì7 days rather than kombucha's ~5‚Äì8, and more effervescence. Its flavor reflects its ingredients which in the case of raw honey produces a less pungent or sour taste than kombucha. A large number of its consumers cite that Jun is lighter and more palatable than kombucha. Though like many cultures Jun can subsist on many diets such as yerba mate, peony, and guayusa, how authentic the result relative to the name becomes is unclear. Jun's cultures are purportedly probiotic in similar fashion to those comprising kombucha and water kefir. Jun, like kombucha, is a probiotic because of the lactobacillus and other beneficial bacteria present in the SCOBY used to brew these drinks, and thus imparted into the liquid. One Jun producer in Washington State (Huney Jun) has tested its products probiotic bacteria content on several occasions, finding two dominant strains in their Jun: Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus paracasei. Total bacteria count reported was 1.3 Trillion CFU/12oz, far more than ever reported from a test sample of kombucha. The most plausible reason for the greater probiotic content in Jun is the prebiotic environment that raw honey creates during the fermentation process. Jun's origin is unclear. It is thought to have originated in northern China and Tibet; many brewers and distributors claim stock originating from imported heirloom Chinese or Tibetan jun cultures and/or openly confess stock to have originated from contraband. According to food writer Sandor Katz, \\"The lack of credible information on the history of Jun leads me to the conclusion that it is a relatively recent divergence from the kombucha family tree. Some websites claim that it comes from Tibet, where it has been made for 1000 years; unfortunately, books on Tibetan food, and even a specialized book on Himalayan ferments, contain no mention of it... The culture is somewhat obscure and hard to find, but its epicenter seems to be the Pacific Northwest, where the Eugene, Oregon-based Herbal Junction Elixirs produces it commercially as well as Leavenworth, Washington producer Huney Jun.\\"Katz, Sandor Ellix. 2012. The Art of Fermentation: an in depth exploration of essential concepts and processes from around the world. Chelsea Green Publishers. Despite Katz's profession of a paucity of evidence for Jun's history, the oldest Tibetan tradition, the Bon, still today cultivate it. Katz's conjecture is also contradicted by Chris Straight's observation that a refined ingredient like cane sugar, unavailable in the distant past of Jun's ostensible origin, couldn't plausibly be the original ferment's recipe, whereas raw honey is‚Äîas it has ever been‚Äîready to use straight from the hive. Straight does note that today's commercially produced raw honey, if unstrained, has the potential to introduce contaminants such as bee parts. Perhaps due to honey's strong antiseptic properties, Straight notes that in his years of experience he has never yet yielded a compromised batch. The obscurity of Jun is partly due to the ethos surrounding its origin as a beverage to aid enlightenment: commercial transactions of Jun culture are viewed by its creators to violate its intent, and many brewing practices common amongst other fermentations may be viewed by many of Jun's most venerable brewers as confounding conditions considered prerequisite to obtaining Jun's greatest potential. Jun's origins' obscurity may partly be a function of its embracing local ecologies, similarly to Japanese koji culture (Aspergillus oryzae) which starts simply from rice thrown onto healthy soil, making Jun more accurately considered a genre of ferments rather than being capable of codifying a definition as any specific sampling from amongst myriad suitable sources.

During the occupation, the city of nearly was incorporated into Belgium under a single occupation authority.  Military operations  = Invasion = On the night of May 9‚Äì10, 1940, German armored vehicles crossed the Ardennes to the southeast. German bombers focused their attacks on strategic points, such as the railway line in the Lille suburb of Lambersart. The German army advanced rapidly, occupying Luxembourg and Belgium before eventually reaching Lille on May 27. After three panzer divisions attacked from west of the De√ªle river, French and British soldiers withdrew from the city, leaving only a few pioneer regiment units, eighty administrative clerks, and a thousand Senegalese soldiers entrenched in the Citadel of Lille. Though otherwise ill-equipped, the Senegalese regiment's armored vehicles allowed them to resist the siege for four days. To prevent strategic resources from falling into German hands, the British destroyed the Boitelle telephone center and burned a stockpile of military equipment that could not be escorted to the zone libre in time. On the morning of May 28, German patrols defeated pockets of resistance around the Rue de Solf√©rino, the Rue Nationale, and the Haute-De√ªle. Field headquarters were set up in the , also known as the Grand'Place. On May 31, the last remaining resistance on the Boulevard de Dunkerque in Lambersart and in the Citadel laid down their arms. The Battle of Lille officially ended on June 1, when French soldiers were marched through the city streets and the Grand'Place. The final death toll was 174, including 15 civilians, 128 French soldiers, 1 British soldier, and 30 German soldiers. Two bridges and two hundred and twenty buildings were destroyed, including the Place de Tourcoing and the buildings surrounding the Porte de B√©thune. = Bombings = The Lille city center was largely left undamaged by aerial raids during the German occupation. In contrast, outlying neighborhoods endured numerous attacks. Most affected were the Lille-Fives metalworks factories (targeted eight times between 1941 and 1944), the SNCF workshops in Hellemmes, the Lille-D√©livrance classification yard, the spinning mills in the Moulins neighborhood of Lille (targeted five times between 1941 and 1944), as well as the Kuhlmann chemical complexes in Loos and Marquette.  German administrative structure The German High Command in Paris had no authority over the Nord and Pas-de-Calais departments, which were instead incorporated into Belgium under the purview of the Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France, based in Brussels. Germany's intent was to weaken France by depriving it of two departments that contained numerous sources of wealth (e.g., spinning mills, steel mills, mines, and paper mills). The Military Administration's field headquarters, OFK 670, in Lille was based at the Lille Chamber of Commerce and led by General Heinrich Niehoff. General Niehoff held full authority over Nord and Pas-de- Calais. On April 17, 1941, an order of the OFK 670 stated that \\"the execution of the following laws, orders, decrees, and decisions emanating from the French government has been forbidden with retroactive effect within the administrative area of the OFK 670.\\" Fifty-six decrees were nullified following this declaration. Within the Lille administrative area, OFK 569 handled matters such as security services, postal services, civil unrest, passive defense, prisoners, ration cards, and counter-espionage.  Resistance  In Lille, acts of resistance consisted mainly of disobedience, theft, and the distribution of clandestine newspapers, such as L'Homme libre by Jean- Baptiste Lebas. The plains of the Nord d√©partement made it difficult to establish any maquis, as in the more mountainous regions. Moreover, numerous German contingents were posted to Lille. Consequently, few attempts were made to directly sabotage German installations. Out of those that were sabotaged, most were factories and railways. German soldiers and collaborators in the area were also occasionally found dead. Three major networks operating in Lille and the greater administrative area in France were particularly active: * \\"Sylvestre or Farmer\\": a French affiliate network created and led by Britain's Special Operations Executive agent Michael Trotobas. Destroyed 22 transformers and 12 circuit breakers in Lille-Fives, for example on June 26, 1943. Trotobas was killed by German military police on November 27, 1943. * \\"OCM\\" (Organisation civile et militaire): a movement created in Paris in November 1940. Very active in the distribution of clandestine newspapers and the collection of intelligence, particularly military-related intelligence. * \\"FTP\\" (Francs-Tireurs et Partisans): a network created in 1942 and run by the PCF, based in Paris and led by Jacques Duclos. Examples of acts of sabotage: * November 4, 1940: cables sabotaged at La Madeleine (a fine was imposed on the city government) * The night of May 26‚Äì27, 1941: officer murdered in Lille * January 9, 1943: Army depot in Lille attacked * November 5, 1943: train derailed between Lille and Tourcoing  Life under the occupation  = Relations with the German occupiers = In June 1940 and August‚ÄìSeptember 1944, the city's residents had very tense relations with their German occupiers. The oldest among them still bore the scars of the previous German occupation during the First World War,On the issue of the German occupation of Lille during the First World War, see while the youngest were unnerved by the Nazi regime. The German authorities stepped up their efforts to maintain cordial relations with the residents of Lille, in order to facilitate plans to incorporate Nord and Pas-de-Calais into one great Flemish State. To that end, they opened canteens, lent aid to the elderly, and even offered sweets to children. = Rationing =  Distributing provisions  In April 1940, Lille and five other cities in the region obtained substantial supplies of foodstuffs and clothing. Around of meat were stored in the refrigerated warehouses of Lille. In May 1940, many shops began to be looted by hungry refugees. The Prefect, Fernand Carles, addressed the issue by re-opening food shops and pharmacies. The next step was to requisition and redistribute existing stocks as fairly as possible. In June 1940, Lille became the first city in France to issue ration cards (for bread, milk, coal, etc.). Each resident was sorted into a category based on their age and sex, at which point they received a ration card (carte individuelle d'alimentation) with monthly supply vouchers. A local Reprovisioning Committee (Comit√© de Ravitaillement) was formed on June 5, and due to its considerable efforts, Lille residents received of bread daily, each time in exchange for one bread voucher. Under the occupation, supply problems were managed by the offices of the Prefecture, which had to work with the German Supply office and comply with the orders of the OFK 670. Between September and December 1940, an agency was in charge of amassing supplies of goods and regulating their commercialization, until the establishment of the General Reprovisioning Directorate (Direction du Ravitaillement G√©n√©ral) for the Nord d√©partement on January 1, 1941. However, the OFK 670 maintained absolute de facto control over the population's supplies.  Difficulties  The occupation authority encouraged relations with Belgium, even in the matter of supplies. Lille residents engaged in trade with their Belgian neighbors, sending food, chemical products, pharmaceuticals, coal, and more. Fraudulent activity was common, which harmed the interests of the General Directorate. The black market covered up to 60% of the city's needs, but also lead to food inflation. Such illicit trafficking of goods was severely punished by the authorities. There were special rules and restrictions in place: * More than 1,000 establishments in Lille selling alcoholic beverages were subject to certain rules (e.g., the sale of alcohol was strictly forbidden three days out of the week, and every such establishment had to close at a certain hour). * Article 1 of the Order of May 2, 1941 set forth regulations on restaurants. A la carte service was forbidden, meat portions were limited, and fresh bread was not allowed to be served, among other restrictions. * Business cafeterias that received either \\"normal\\" or \\"privileged\\" levels of food supplies (e.g., cafeterias in metalworks plants working on the Atlantic Wall) were under the control of the OFK 670 in 1941. Weekly markets in Lille (such as those selling fruits, vegetables, and meats) saw a major drop in customers during the war, a situation that only worsened under the occupation, as all products required a voucher. Fish sellers in the Wazemmes neighborhood and on the Rue Solf√©rino had the most success. Lines grew long in front of grocery stores and food shops. Many bakeries were closed down or looted. The largest bread factory and flour mill in France during the interwar period was the Ind√©pendante, which supplied many cities in the region. Consequently, it drew the Germans' interest the moment they arrived in Lille, resulting in German military personnel being posted there. Sugar was more readily available in Lille than in some other regions of the country, but supplies of meat remained scarce. Hunting permits were issued by a department of the OFK 670 in Lille, led by Chief Inspector Estorff, a friend of Marshall G√∂ring. Wine was rationed, leading to significant levels of wine trafficking that even the Germans themselves contributed to. Coal, leather, oil, and metals were also frequently in short supply. = Recreation and culture =  Recreational life continues  Cultural consumption in Lille continued apace, likely due to a general desire to be distracted from current events. Performances were sometimes interrupted by air raid sirens or blackouts. In movie theaters, Nazi propaganda and German news reports frequently preceded film screenings. The Th√©√¢tre S√©bastopol was often full, though the Germans paid little attention to it, caring only that theatergoers complied with the rules. Although the French were allowed to attend German performances, such as at the Op√©ra starting in 1941, they rarely did so. On May 10, 1941, the \\"Deutsche Theater\\" was unveiled, with the goal of turning the Op√©ra de Lille into a veritable German cultural space. It would be the site of many performances, including operas, plays, ballets, and concerts. Exhibitions in Lille were still common, and their topics were often in alignment with Nazi propaganda (e.g., \\"Bolshevism against Europe\\" in June 1942). The most active sports associations in Lille were association football, cycling, rowing (Lille's oldest sports club), and track and field. Flandre-Lille, a football team well known for its high level of play, finished second in the 1944 French Championship. In November 1944, the Lille Olympiqe Sporting Club was formed from the merger of two other association football clubs. Three Paris‚ÄìRoubaix cycling events took place during the war. There were numerous community gardens in Lille during the occupation.  Restrictions on cultural activities  The Germans imposed a number of restrictions on recreational life and cultural activities in Lille. Jewish pieces were not allowed to be played at concerts, and English- language films were banned in 1940. Dancing in public places was outlawed on August 20, 1940; however, dancing was allowed in certain schools, which had to comply with strict rules imposed by the Germans. Sign-up fees were often high, so residents from poorer backgrounds would make do by attending secret dances, at the risk of being fined. On September 8, 1939, the Biblioth√®que Municipale was closed to the public, its collections periodically transferred to other regions. Published works were not allowed to \\"harm German prestige and interests,\\" according to one rule on book publishing. The physical quality of books worsened during the war, owing to a shortage of paper. = Medical and social assistance = The national government was slow to act, so private organizations‚Äîincluding the ACO (Catholic Action for Workers), the LOC (League of Christian Workers), and the Social Secretariat of Lille‚Äîhandled the distribution of emergency relief to the families of the men away at war. Those families who were most in need were given money. The first soup kitchens in Lille were set up in November 1940. Low-cost restaurants were set up in 1941, along with school cafeterias. Heated shelters, open every afternoon except Sundays, were also established in Lille. They had readings rooms, nurses, sewing machines, and more. Finally, the organization National Relief (Secours National) focused its relief efforts on aid to bombing victims, and also engaged in rescue operations.  Relief organizations  On June 4, 1940, the SSBM (Society for Relief to Wounded Soldiers), UFF (Union of French Women), and ADF (Association of French Ladies) merged to form the French Red Cross. The Committee of the French Red Cross in Lille engaged in a variety of activities, such as opening two clinics and offering training for nurses. Numerous volunteers worked for the Red Cross, and most of the Committee's resources were devoted to aiding the suffering (particularly prisoners in Loos, as well as the wounded, the sick, undernourished children, etc.). In April 1942, the Youth Red Cross was formed. In the first year of the war, the \\"Dames,\\" female volunteers trained in healthcare, managed the train station cafeteria reserved for soldiers on leave, while also helping with various other day-to-day tasks (notable examples include Marie-Rose Dalmar and Elisabeth Biarez). They were very active during the occupation and cared for numerous patients. First-aid workers were also very active, particularly following the 1942 bombings of Fives and Helemmes. During this period, under the stewardship of Maurice Defives, Lille was the best-organized city when it came to first aid, with 260 first-aid responders in 1943. The job was not without its dangers, however, as demonstrated when four aid workers were gunned down by the SS in 1944. The existence of German organizations such as the NSV (Socialist National Assistance, or \\"New Society of Vandals\\" according to the locals), established in 1940, as well as a group of German nurses known as Schwestern (\\"sisters\\"), attests to the Nazi Party's desire to show goodwill to the French, with the goal of reconciling their two peoples. However, these organizations ceased operations in early 1941.  Hospitals  There were numerous hospitals in Lille, including the Scrive Military Hospital, which mostly cared for prisoners from Loos and victims of torture at the hands of the secret police in La Madeleine. It was completely occupied by the Germans in 1941, and in 1942 entry to the premises was forbidden. There was also Saint-Sauveur Hospital, which was originally reserved for civilians until a large influx of soldiers arrived in May 1940. The Germans abandoned Saint- Sauveur on August 30, 1944, as well as Calmette Hospital, which specialized in pulmonary conditions (particularly tuberculosis), surgery, and care for victims of gas attacks. In general, there was a shortage of healthcare workers and medicine, and a surplus of victims and patients.  Passive defense  Passive defense comprised the range of measures designed to protect the civilian population from aerial bombings. The prefect of the Nord d√©partement was responsible for instituting these measures and ensuring they ran smoothly. They consisted of keeping the public informed, maintaining lookouts, concealing light sources, sounding alarms, and organizing shelters and relief efforts. The population was kept informed using posters, the press, books, and comics. School curricula also included a 12-hour unit on passive defense in CEP classes. The surrounding airspace was monitored by lookouts on the roofs of the hospital center(Cit√© Hospitali√®re), which was under construction at the time. Potential sightings were passed on to the Prefecture, which decided whether or not to sound the alarms. With the start of the German occupation in May 1940, Allied bombers became the focus of airspace monitoring. French authorities, and later the German authorities, greatly emphasized the need to conceal light sources. Allied bombings frequently took place at night so that the planes could avoid being spotted. A German circular issued by General Niehoff on June 25, 1940 called on the city's residents to equip their outward-facing windows and other openings with curtains and shutters. The circular also called on residents to decrease the brightness of their lights, for example by using lampshades. It concluded by warning citizens that \\"any person in breach of these rules or other ad hoc prescriptions will be fined RM or imprisoned for a period of up to one year.\\" The city's residents were encouraged to seek refuge in shelters during bombing attacks. The types of shelters varied; trenches, bunkers, former casemates, and cellars were used. Many cellars in Lille were modified to withstand building collapses or prevent entryways from collapsing. Support structures were added, and neighboring cellars were connected to each other. These modifications were also made to the city's former fortifications, including Portes de B√©thune, Douai, and Arras.  Repression  The OFK 670 regularly issued orders in reaction to strikes or acts of sabotage, or to command the population to comply with a new measure. The German military authority relied on a few different policing forces to maintain order. First there were the military services, the Feldgendarmerie (military police) and the GFP (Geheimefeldpolizei, or Secret Field Police), which initially handled matters internal to the German army before shifting focus to the resistance. There was also the Sipo-SD (commonly known as the Gestapo), the political police for the Nazi party, based in the La Madeleine suburb of Lille. The Gestapo handled all matters of a \\"political\\" nature (e.g., searching for Gaullists, communists, downed pilots, or agents sent by London). The Jewish population in Lille and the surrounding region also endured repression starting in 1942. = Sanctions against the civilian population = Numerous measures were instituted in order to ban and suppress strikes. On June 3, 1941, General Niehoff outlawed strikes and attempts to encourage strikes, under penalty of \\"the German authorities' most severe sanctions.\\" On August 23, 1944, an order stated that striking workers were subject to deportation to mines in the Ruhr region and could see their pay suspended or lose their right to unemployment benefits. Two days later, a notice was posted ordering all restaurants and performances to be shut down and all civilians to stay in their homes until striking workers agreed to return to work. Those who did not comply with these orders would be summarily shot. Starting in 1942, General Niehoff regularly issued orders requiring employees to work on Sundays. On occasion, civilians suffered reprisals for acts committed by the Resistance, in instances where the Germans could not find the culprits. Radio receivers were confiscated, hostages were taken, and people were deported, arbitrarily arrested, or at worst, executed. For example, following the sabotage of a railway line on April 1, 1944, eighty-six civilians in the village of Ascq were executed.√âtienne Dejongles, art. cit. = Sanctions against political prisoners and resistance fighters = Over the course of the occupation, the Germans arrested people who would later be considered as \\"political prisoners.\\" The Order of September 19, 1941 stated that \\"all political prisoners may be treated as hostages held responsible for lethal attacks by unidentified perpetrators on German soldiers, policemen, and their equivalents. For every German killed, a minimum of five hostages will be executed [‚Ä¶].\\" As a result, many prisoners were executed at the Citadel of Lille, a site that would also see the executions of traitors and collaborators after the Liberation. In total, twenty-five were executed by firing squad under the occupation. Notices were posted informing the public about executions of political prisoners, saboteurs, and hostages in response to attacks or acts of sabotage against the German occupiers. The OFK 670 issued numerous circulars limiting the freedoms of Jewish people. Beginning in July 1941, certain professions were forbidden to Jews, who also saw their radios confiscated and their possessions \\"aryanized.\\" In the region as a whole, Jews were subject to curfew between 8 pm and 7 am, and a circular issued on November 14, 1941 banned Jews from entering most restaurants, pubs, bars, and caf√©s. Jewish deportations began in 1942. The city's residents were not always indifferent to their plight. Examples include Pastor Nick, Father Stahl, and the German military chaplain Friedrich Gunther, who was gunned down on August 26, 1944 on the steps of the OFK 670 (by one of his former superiors). = The liberation of Lille = From August 19 to 25, elements of the F.F.I. in Paris, aided by General Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division, liberated the capital. On September 1, the British front lines were approaching the city of Arras. Signs of retreat could be observed as early as August 20. German soldiers were attempting to return to Germany, and equipment stored in the Lille barracks, along with heavy tanks, began to be evacuated on September 1 via the Rue Esquermoise in the city center. The Gestapo and the GFP military police were evacuating their offices on the Rue Tenremonde and the Avenue Saint-Maur in La Madeleine. On August 31, the Germans blew up a munitions and fuel reserve depot. Despite this emerging unrest, as of September 1 the OFK 670 was still in operation, as were the tramways and the electricity and water supply services. On the night of September 2, police cadets who were also members of the Resistance liberated the Citadel, seizing 100 crates of grenades, 1,800 rifles, and 4 heavy machine guns. By the end of morning that same day, the order was given to withdraw from Lille, and the last of the military staff were in the process of leaving the city. The French Forces of the Interior (FFI) received instructions to occupy city hall, the telephone center, and the Lille Chamber of Commerce, former headquarters of the OFK 670. That afternoon, four heavy tanks, isolated and without escort, had been left to guard the rear in the city center and were progressing down the city's main arteries (Rue Nationale, Rue Faidherbe, Rue Artois, and Rue des Postes). A unit of a dozen tanks, escorted by camouflaged cyclists, was evacuated via the Boulevard Victor Hugo while sustaining fire from members of the FFI, who were firing from behind windows in the surrounding homes.Maurice Roland, art. cit. On September 2, at 6 pm, Lille was largely liberated from the Germans and would be definitively so by the end of morning on September 4 when British tanks and armoured cars rolled through. All told, approximately 50 people were killed and 600 wounded during the liberation.  Collaboration and purges  Collaborationist movements sprang up in the Nord d√©partement as early as 1940. The Vlaamsch Verbond van Frankrijk (VVF, Flemish Federation of France), established in 1940, developed a cultural and educational program designed to highlight the close cultural relationship between the Flemish and the Germans. The goal was to justify the incorporation of Lille into Belgium, with a view to rebuilding \\"Germanic Europe.\\" Other collaborationist movements were sub- sections of national political parties. The Francist Party, founded by Marcel Bucard in 1933, was approved by the OFK 670 on October 27, 1941. Its operations focused on distributing pamphlets. The party also attempted grandiose and destructive measures against symbols of the Republic, but gradually lost steam over the course of the occupation. The Parti Populaire Fran√ßais (PPF), founded by Jacques Doriot in 1936, was approved by the OFK 670 in December 1941. As of 1942, its operations could mainly be characterized as anticommunist and \\"mar√©chaliste\\" (in reference to the cult of personality surrounding Marshall P√©tain). The PPF regularly lacked money and activists, and was criticized for recruiting members with lengthy criminal records. The Milice fran√ßaise, established by the Vichy government in 1943, was approved by Brussels on March 19, 1944. It quickly came into conflict with the other collaborationist movements (the Francist Party, the PPF, and the VVF). There were around thirty militiamen in Lille, who carried out arrests and identity checks and participated actively in the black market. Thus, while some collaborationist movements did develop in the region, they attracted very few members, and their activities remained limited. This was possibly due to the population's fears of annexation to Germany, as well as to the traditional patriotism that characterized the Nord d√©partement. Legal and extralegal crackdowns on collaborationists were relatively restrained. They were carried out by sub-sections of the Court of Justice operating under the authority of the Douai Court of Appeals, as well as by military tribunals. In all, 3,999 people were punished, 307 of whom were sentenced to death. The proportion of people condemned to death as compared to the total number of people given sentences was the lowest in France. Military collaboration was punished more so than political collaboration. In addition, the majority of those executed were blue-collar laborers (60%), while only 10.5% were soldiers or police officers. Other punishments included imprisonment, confiscation of property, and fines. Once again, most of those affected were laborers rather than white- collar workers, who were more easily able to obtain acquittals. The reason so many victims of the purges came from poor backgrounds stems from the fact that a disproportionate number of collaborators were themselves of humble origin. Indeed, unemployment, poverty, and undernourishment tended to encourage collaboration. Youths also made up a large portion of those targeted by the purges, given that they accounted for around 37% of those implicated in acts of military collaboration. One hundred and fifty-six people in the d√©partement endured extralegal crackdowns. These kinds of reprisals were already occurring as early as 1941, before the Liberation, mostly in urban areas such as Lille. Indeed, collaboration in the Nord d√©partement mainly took place in urban areas. Reprisals against collaborators mostly amounted to combat actions rather than acts of personal vengeance.

It is an Anglican Parish Church in the Diocese of Leicester and is designated by Historic England as a Grade II* listed building. In addition, the North Chapel of the Church has been converted into a coffee bar. The Parish Church of St Mary's in Hinckley. Brief History St Mary's parish church in Hinckley was dedicated in the Middle Ages to the Assumption of Saint Mary the Virgin. This church building has stood on the site for almost nine hundred years, although there may well have been a church already on the site, as the remnants of an Anglo Saxon sun-dial is visible on the diagonal buttress on the south-east corner of the chancel.Davis. B (1996) An illustrated guide to St Mary's Parish Church, pp5 The church was built by William FitzOsbern, who came over with William the Conqueror. 1066 ‚Äì 1926 A parish church has stood in this site for over 900 years. F.C Bedford, who wrote a guide to St Mary's in 1936, says, \`It is generally agreed among historians that a Saxon church existed at one time in Hinckley'. The name Hinckley is Anglo-Saxon: 'Hinck' is someone's name, and 'ley' is a meadow.Davis, B (1996), An illustrated guide to St Mary's Parish Church So if there was an Anglo-Saxon settlement here, it is fairly safe to assume that there would have been a church building. The church's income was granted by its founder, William FitzOsbern, to the Abbey of Lyre in Normandy, and the connection with this Norman abbey continued intermittently until 1415 when the revenue was finally transferred to the Priory of Mount Grace in Yorkshire. (This piece of history explains the name given to Mount Grace High School, Leicester Road, Hinckley, which is built on land once owned by the church). When Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in 1542 he gave the former estates of Mount Grace Priory in Hinckley, together with the patronage (the right to appoint the vicar) of St. Mary's to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey. The Dean and Chapter kept the patronage until 1874 when it was transferred to the Bishop of Peterborough. When Leicester became a separate diocese in 1926 it was taken over by the Bishop of Leicester, who remains the patron to this day. A Benedictine priory was founded in Hinckley in the eleventh century. The old priory building, which was on the south side of the church (where the present St Mary's Church Community Hall is) survived until 1827 when it was demolished, to make way for cottages (Hunter's Row). These were demolished in 1912. Present building The layout of St Mary's Church Hinckley, 2006 The present church was rebuilt in the thirteenth century. A beam found during the Victorian rebuilding was inscribed with the date 1246. The oldest parts of the church you see today date from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries ‚Äì roughly 1240 to 1400. These are the tower, nave and chancel. A large scale restoration took place between 1875 and 1878, at a cost of ¬£10,000 (in today's money about ¬£10,000,000, if you take into account an average working man's wage). The architect was Ewan Christian. The Vicar was Rev W.H. Disney, who spent ten years at Hinckley (1874 -1884). He wrote about his time in Hinckley in his autobiography, 'Incidents during Thirty Years Clerical Work in Ireland and England (published 1898).http://www.worldcat.org/title/incidents-during- thirty-years-clerical-work-in-ireland-and- england/oclc/11121598?referer=di&ht;=edition He begins his account of his ministry in Hinckley: \`My health is now broken. The nervous system gave way under the strain often years' unceasing work in a manufacturing town in Leicestershire'. There is a plaque in memory of Rev. W.H. Disney on the south wall of the Chancel in the church. The old north and south aisles and transepts were demolished in 1875, along with the great west singing gallery or singing loft, erected 1723. This gallery projected two bays towards the east. There were also galleries in the north and south aisles, which were also demolished. The poor used to be herded into the north gallery, which was filled with benches seating 360. New and larger aisles and transepts were built. When completed there was seating for 1,200 people, all on oak pews. Each transept had its own door so that the children could enter and leave without disturbing the rest of the congregation! The chancel was restored and re-roofed in 1880. Sadly a lot of the stone used by the Victorians in the 1875/78 restoration was of poor quality, and has had to be replaced over the years. Restoration 1993 ‚Äì 2006 Extensive restoration work was carded out to the spire and tower in 1993 & 1994\\\\. The top twelve feet of the spire was completely rebuilt, with much new stone. The south west pinnacle was rebuilt, and some of the decorative work on the tower renewed. The north stone spitter (or spout to throw water away from the tower) was completely renewed, and the underside carved with a likeness of the Vicar. Several other areas of stonework were restored including much of the parapet on the two gables of the Lady Chapel and elsewhere. Further restoration was carded out in 1998-9. Among other work, the south east buttress to the vestry was underpinned and rebuilt, and the upper half of the east wall of the Lady Chapel (1999) had to be completely rebuilt. Early in 2006 a lot of crumbling stonework was replaced ‚Äì in the eastern section of the north aisle. In particular fine new stone was added to the buttress at the north west corner of the north aisle, and the north west corner of the north transept. Also the whole of the interior was redecorated areas were re-plastered, and repairs carried out to several window sills. The total cost was about ¬£35,000. Exterior St Mary's Church Hinckley from south east The outstanding feature of the church is undoubtedly the tower (25.3 metres) and spire (a further 30 .5 metres) which can be seen for miles around. This massive tower, whose walls are 1.7m thick, was built in the early fourteenth century. The large western window was added in the fifteenth century. The stone surrounding the west door was restored in 1895. The tower has battlements with angle pinnacles. It is supported by eight buttresses set in pairs at the angles, each having four stages. At the south- east comer of the tower is a stone winding staircase which gives access to the battlements and a splendid view of the town, and far off Coventry. The spire was erected in 1788, replacing an earlier one which had been badly damaged two years previously by storms and lightning. The copper weathercock is 63.5 cm high, 95.25 cm long and weighs 5 kg, and was made for the new spire in 1788, and is inscribed with the name of the vicar, John Cole Galloway. (Re-gilded 1994) The walls of the nave are thirteenth century but the battlements with crocketted pinnacles at the comers are Victorian. Interior The interior of St Mary's Church Hinckley showing Nave and Rood Loft The church is entered via the North door, or through what was the North Chapel but is now the coffee bar. The total length of the church, including the chancel and tower is 38.4m. But the most remarkable feature is the width of the building compared with its length: it is almost a square. The total length of the nave is only 19.1m while the width of the nave and aisles is 21.7m, and including the transepts, 31.7m. The chancel is also small for such a large building being only ll.9m long and 5.5m wide. The tower is 5.6m by 5.6m. The height of the nave to the centre of the roof is 11m. Font Part of the restoration of 1875‚Äì78 : it was originally placed near the north door, and was removed to its present position in 1888. It has a circular bowl, on four small attached piers, with four marble shafts standing on a high base. Round the bowl is carved the text; \`\`Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not.\\" (Words of Jesus, see Mark, Chapter 10, verse 14) Tower arch Perhaps the finest architectural feature of the church is this arch (early fourteenth century). It is four-centred, the upper curves of which are very flat, without capitals, and with ribs at each angle running from floor to the point of the arch. Rood screen In medieval times, there would have been a beautifully carved rood screen, but this was destroyed during the reformation. However, the original thirteenth century winding stone stair still remains and in accessed on the right of the chancel arch. The steps have never been restored and are very worn. The current rood screen was erected in 1905 as a memorial to Queen Victoria, at a cost of ¬£250.Davis, B (1996) An illustrated guide to St Mary's Parish Church' pp23 In 1931 the crucifix and figures of St Mary (on the left) and St John were added. The choir stalls all belong to the Victorian restoration. Music at St Mary's Roger FiField (centre) and Rowan Almet (left) during the installation of the current organ at St Mary's Hinckley There is a long history of music at St Mary's Church. The church currently boasts an organ, two worship bands and numerous choirs including a traditional robed choir and Gospel Choirs.http://www.stmaryshinckley.co.uk The first organ was installed in the east gallery in 1808, built by George Pike England, the son of the famous organ builder George England. It had three keyboards, 21 stops and 1,370 pipes but no pedal board. It cost ¬£525.Davis, B (1996) An illustrated guide to St Mary's Parish Church, pp25 During the Victorian restoration, the organ was rebuilt on the south side of the chancel. In 1908 a new organ was built by Norman and Beard in the north transept of the chancel. It had 37 speaking stops and over 2,000 pipes. It was electrified in 1966. By the 1990s it was in much need of restoration and it was eventually dismantled and replaced with an organ from a redundant church in Leicester ‚Äì St Paul's, Kirby Road. This organ contained some original pipework by Brindley & Foster of Sheffield. The installation of the organ, completed in 2005, was done by Roger Fifield of Leamington Spa. It has 43 speaking stops and about 2,500 pipes. Stained glass windows There are a number of stained glass windows remaining in the church. Stained Glass Windows depicting the childhood of Christ and Education At the west end of the south aisle are two windows. The one on the left in memory of Herbert and Edith Clark. Herbert became chairman of Sketchley Dye Works and lived in Forest View (now in the grounds of John Cleveland College) Burlison and Grylls created this window with a very English looking Mary and a shepherd resembling George V in 1919 In the side chapel is probably the favourite window in St Mary's, depicting the Nativity. It was created by Burlison and Grylls in 1919 and shows a very English looking Mary, with golden hair, and shepherds with well trimmed bears, one even resembling George V. Other windows include The Annunciation by Mayer & Co about 1890, also in the Side Chapel, and in the north aisle, near the entrance, is the Resurrection Window, in memory of Elizabeth and Margaret Yeomans (1925) which was made by Christopher Webb. Clock and Bells and Chimes The church contains one of the finest peals of bells in the county.http://www.stmaryshinckley.co.uk/clock Five of these were first cast at the start of the seventeenth century. In 1925 all eight were recast; the heaviest weighs 1.12 tonnes. The bells are still rungs every Sunday for the main morning worship and practice sessions are held on Monday evening. The current clock was installed by Gillett & Johnston of Croydon in 1876. It strikes the Westminster Quarters on four bells. In the clock room there is also a Carillon ‚Äì it operates like a large musical box. The mahogany barrel is 1.22m long and 0.91m in diameter.Davis, B (1996) An illustrated guide to St Mary's Parish Church' pp50 The clock and carillon underwent a major restoration in 2016. The tunes change every day. Three original tunes remain ‚Äì Hymn by Handel, The National Anthem and Highland Laddie. Other tunes include Aurelia by SS Wesley, St Francis Xavier by Handel.

It is a subspecies of Iris spuria, a rhizomatous perennial plant, from the Caucasus region, it is a tall iris with sky blue or white flowers. It was originally described by Fomin, as a separate species before Brian Mathew in 1981, added it to Iris spuria as one of its many subspecies. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It has a thick, creeping, horizontal, branched rhizome. The creeping habit creates large clumps of plants. It has linear, flat, lanceolate, lacuminate (ending in a point), leaves. These can grow up to between long and 10‚Äì18 mm wide. The leaves are generally either equal to the flowering stem or longer than it.British Iris Society (1997) James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) It has a sightly compressed, stem (or peduncle), that grows up to between long. It has small, green, leathery ovate or lanceolate, spathes (leaves of the flower bud). They have a white membranous edging. The stems hold between 3‚Äì5 terminal (top of stem) flowers, on unequal pedicels, in summer, between June and July, or between May and June (in the US and Britain). The lightly fragranced flowers, can be up to in diameter, and come in shades of sky blue, light blue, or white. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'.} The long and narrow falls have a reflexed, elliptical, almost round blade, with a yellow central stripe or blaze, which leads along the long thin claw (section closest to the stem). They also have dark veining. They are long. The erect, upright standards, are slightly ruffled, oblanceolate and single coloured. Over the falls, are the style branches, which are slightly shorter than the claw of falls. They have a 2 lobed end (or notched end), and a defined crest or ridge leading to the stem. They have a cylindrical perianth tube (which about two- fifths the length of ovary), light purple anthers and a cylindrical ovary with 6 ribs. After the iris has flowered, it produces an ovaloid (or ellipsoid), cylindrical, seed capsule between late August and early September. It is 2‚Äì3 times longer than wide, it has a beak-like appendage. Inside the capsule, are brown, semi-circular seeds, with wrinkled skins. =Biochemistry= In 1999, a chemical compound study was carried out on the rhizomes of Iris spuria subsp. carthalinae. It found several new compounds. Iristectorigenin B 7-gentiobioside (also found in Juniperus macropoda) was found in the iris.John Buckingham and V. Ranjit N. Munasinghe As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.} It has a chromosome count: 2n=44.  Taxonomy Plant with stem, flower and leaves It is written as ÂüÉÂèäÁßçÊ§çÈ∏¢Â∞æ in Chinese script and known as Ai Ji Zhong Zhi Yuan Wei in Pinyin Chinese, also known commonly as Egypt Planted Iris. The Latin specific epithet carthaliniae refers to a Carthalin (a former Russian province in the Caucasus).Eobald Toze This epithet has also been used for Paeonia carthalinica Ketsk. (which is now classified as a synonym of Paeonia tenuifolia L.) It is also known as Iris Kartalinia in Russia, or Iris Kartli (in Georgia). Kartli refers to an historical region in central-to-eastern Georgia. It has also been known as blue iris. This name is normally a common name for Iris spuria. It was originally published and described by Aleksandr Vasiljevich Fomin as Iris carthaliniae in 'Vƒïstnik Tiflisskago Botaniceskago Sada. Moniteur du Jardin Botanique de Tiflis' (Vƒïstn. Tiflissk. Bot. Sada) Vol.14 page44 in 1909. The description was based on specimens collected in Georgia near the town of Mtskheta, within the Caucasus Mountains near the city of Tbilisi. Later, in 1981 Brian Mathew re- classified the species as a subspecies of Iris spuria, and published it as Iris spuria L. subsp. carthaliniae (Fomin) B.Mathew, in (his book The Iris on page 117 in 1981. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 9 January 2003 and then updated on 1 March 2007. Iris spuria subsp. carthaliniae is a tentatively accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate regions of central Asia. =Range= It has been found in the Caucasus region, within (the former USSR state of) Georgia (or Gruzia), Azerbaijan, and Armenia. It is found along the middle and upper Kura River and of its tributaries. In 2003, it is noted that it has been found in Anatolia and the east Mediterranean area. =Habitat= It grows in wet or moist sites, in marshy or wet meadows, woodland, and beside the coastal parts of roads. It is found on lowland or the middle mountain belt altitudes. Conservation It is listed as one of the endangered plants in the Republic of Georgia. Cultivation Iris spuria subsp. carthaliniae is hardy to between USDA Zone 5 to Zone 9, including New England. It is hardy to Europe Zone H2. It is also hardy in Leningrad, Russia, surviving the winter unprotected. It can grow in ordinary, deep heavy loam in gardens, provided that it has plenty of moisture during the growing season. It prefers positions in full sun. It can be grown in flower beds and borders (with peonies and other herbaceous plants), or along pond edges. Like many other spuria irises, it can be grown in the same place for many decades without distubrance. It is only found in specialised iris plant nurseries. A specimen exists in the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, France. It was collected on 15 May 1930 in the Shirvan steppe of Azerbaijan. Type in Berlin. In 2003, specimens are listed as being found in some botanic gardens and parks in Portugal. =Hybrids and cultivars= Like Iris notha another Spuria species growing in the Caucasus, both are used by iris breeders. A known cultivar is 'Georgian Delicacy'. References Sources *Czerepanov, S. K. 1995. Vascular plants of Russia and adjacent states (the former USSR). [as I. carthalinae Fomin].

They are believed to be the first permanent Japanese settlement in North America and the only settlement by samurai outside of Japan.https://www.sierracollege.edu/ejournals/jsnhb/v5n1/ito.html The group purchased land from Charles Graner family in the Gold Hill region after coming to San Francisco in 1869. Though the group was able to successfully show their produce during the 1869 California State Agricultural Fair in Sacramento and the 1870 Horticultural Fair in San Francisco, the farm as a Japanese colony only existed between 1869 and 1871. Okei Ito, the first known Japanese woman to be buried on American soil, has her grave on the land. The Veerkamp family purchased the farm following the withdrawal of financial support from financier Matsudaira Katamori (1835‚Äì93). In 1969, the same year as the Japanese American centennial, Ronald Reagan, then governor of California, proclaimed the colony to be California Historical Landmark No. 815. The family preserved the heritage of the farm and Okei's grave for 137 years until the American River Conservancy purchased the land in November 2010, with the National Park Service placing the site on the National Register of Historic Places at a level of \\"national significance\\". American River Conservancy offers private and public tours of the property, including Okei Ito's gravesite. History From the early 17th century, Japan was under Shogunate rule and considered an isolated country. The only trade partners were primarily the Dutch. After 260 years, Commodore Matthew Perry forced trade ports to open for the United States (1853‚Äì54). By 1860, the previous cultural isolation and government was starting to disintegrate, separating the country into two groups: those who opposed the isolation and sought change and those who supported the isolation and shogunate rule. Matsudaira Katamori, related by marriage to the ruling Tokugawa family, was a daimy≈ç of the Aizu Wakamatsu Province (today's Fukushima Prefecture) and disagreed with the Tokugawa policy of isolation. Matsudaira subscribed to the political notion of \\"Eastern ethics and Western Science\\". Eventually tensions boiled over and the Boshin Civil War began. Being a daimy≈ç under the Tokugawa clan, 24-year-old Matsudaira was pushed by the Tokugawa shogunate to lead a campaign against the Satsuma (today's Kagoshima).The Satsuma, along with the forces of Choshu and Tosa, made up the Imperial Army who wanted to overthrow the current Shogunate and daimyo rule as they felt it was too weak to deal with foreign forces like the United States, who wanted to force trade. At the Battle of Aizu (1868), Matsudaira's force of samurai was defeated by the larger number sent by the Emperor. John Henry Schnell was an early member of the Prussian embassy. After coming to Japan, he was employed by Lord Matsudaira as an arms dealer for cannons and Gatling guns. During this time, Japan did not have any diplomatic treaties with Germany. Because of this, Schnell dealt with the Japanese by masquerading as a Dutch trader. John Schnell trained Matsudaira's samurai in the use of the firearms and samurai status as genre along with a Japanese name. This allowed him to marry a Japanese samurai class woman (Jou) which strengthened his ties to Japanese society. Due to Matsudaira's loss at Aizu, the daimy≈ç was condemned to death. His surrender placed Schnell and his family's life in danger. Because of this, Schnell asked for funding from Matsudaira and commissioned the SS China to transport his family and 22 other samurai families to the United States. They took with them 50,000 three-year- old kuwa (mulberry trees) used for the cultivation of silk worms and six million tea seeds. Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm The Japanese immigrants arrived in San Francisco on May 20, 1869. They brought with them mulberry trees, silkworm cocoons, tea plant and bamboo shoots, cooking utensils, and swords.\\"Historic Japanese Photograph Collection Presented to California State,\\" Pacific Citizen, June 16-29, 2017, p. 8. They caught the attention of the press, including the San Francisco Alta Daily News, who praised the Japanese work ethic. The colony hoped to establish an agricultural settlement and purchased approximately 200 acres of land, a farmhouse, and farm outbuildings from Charles Graner, the settler for the Gold Hill Ranch (1856) in June 1869. They displayed their silk cocoons, tea and oil plants at the 1869 California State Agricultural Fair in Sacramento and the 1870 Horticultural Fair in San Francisco. However, the drought of 1871 along with other misfortunes such as inadequate funding and a labor dispute led to the bankruptcy of the colony. The final nail in the coffin was the withdrawal of funding by Matsudaira Katamori who was, surprisingly, pardoned by the new Meiji government during the beginning of the Meiji restoration and became a Shinto priest. Schnell and his family told the other colonists that he and his family would return to Japan to request more funding from Matsudaira. Unfortunately, the fates of him and his family are unknown as they did not return to California, leading the colonists to believe they were abandoned in the new world. Future of the colonists Many of the colonists dispersed following the perceived abandonment of John Henry Schnell and the purchase of the land by the Francis Veerkamp family in 1873. A handful stayed and many sold their possessions in order to survive. Some returned to Japan, while others settled elsewhere looking for work. The fates of only three of the colonists are known for certain. Matsunosuke Sakurai stayed to work for the new landowners until his death in 1901. Masumizu Kuninosuke married an African/American Indian woman named Carrie Wilson in Coloma in 1877 and eventually moved to Sacramento where he lived until his death in 1915. There is still extensive family of Kuninosuke in the Sacramento area today. Finally, Okei Ito, who came to the Wakamatsu colony as a nursemaid for the Schnell family at age 17, also stayed in Gold Hill under the employment of the Veercamp family. Unfortunately, Okei's journey in the new world was short lived as she died two years later of illness at the age of 19. She is believed to be the first Japanese woman buried on American soil. Her grave can be found on a hill overlooking the Gold Trail School with a tombstone stating \\"In Memory of Okei, Died 1871. Aged 19 years. A Japanese Girl\\" in English on the front and in Japanese on the back. The tombstone seen on the site now is a replica of the original which has been taken down for preservation. There is also a replica of her gravestone in Aizu Wakamatsu, erected in 1958. American River Conservancy Though the Veerkamp family changed the purpose of the farm and for 125 years grazed cattle and operated a dairy farm, they worked to preserve remnants of the Japanese Colony. In the 1920s, there was an increase of interest in the former Japanese farm. Henry Taketa interviewed a 75-year-old Henry Veerkamp who was friends with Okei in his younger years. The attention led to an influx of Japanese Americans (now facing strict anti-alien laws) in 1924 coming to tend to Okei's gravesite and emphasized the colony as the beginning of Japanese immigration. The 1969 governor of California, future president Ronald Reagan, declared the Wakamatsu Tea and Silk farm to be California Historical Landmark No. 815. The year 1969 was designated by the Japanese American community to be the Japanese American Centennial. This designation drew the attendance of Matsudaira Ichiro (Matsudaira Katamori's grandson) and Japanese Consul General Shima Seiichi to the event supporting both the proclamation of Wakamatsu as a historical site, as well as the date of the centennial. A plaque was placed at the site then by the Parks and Recreation State Department in cooperation with JACL, El Dorado Historical Society and Friends of the Centennial Observance.Plaque at Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm Colony, June 7, 1969 The Veerkamp family donated the original silk and gold-thread banner with the Tokugawa/Matsudaira lotus blossom crest along with a ceremonial dagger believed to have belonged to Jou Schnell (John Henry Schnell's wife) to the Marshall Gold State Historic Park in 2001. In 2007, a member of the family also found photographs taken of the colonists by the studio of Robert Miller in Placerville (1870) in an envelope. Later that year, the family appealed to the American River Conservancy (ARC) to ask for help in restoration of the Graner-Wakamatsu-Veerkamp farmhouse, providing public access and interpretation of the cultural history of the farm. The ARC purchased the site on November 1, 2010 for the appraised market value. Thanks to the efforts of Congressional District Representative Tom McClintock and U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, there were bills introduced to the House and Senate to help the management of the ranch, which was registered at the level of \\"national significance\\" to the National Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service, . Due to the efforts of ARC and its project partners, the Wakamatsu site is now open to the public throughout the year for private and public tours of the historical sites on the property, festivals, and other scheduled events. The property is not a public park and is not open to the public except during scheduled events. Two small farms lease portions of the land and homes from the ARC and practice sustainable agriculture there, in keeping with the historical use of the land as a farm by both the Japanese colonists and the Veerkamp family.

Limniris and in the series Iris ser. Spuriae. It is a subspecies of Iris spuria, a rhizomatous perennial plant, from the Caucasus region, with blue-violet flowers. It is commonly known as Dimitry iris in Russia. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description The iris is very similar in form to Iris notha, another spuria Iris from the Caucasus region.British Iris Society (1997) Both dislike wet soils. It has a rhizome which has not been generally described. It has stiff, dark green leaves that can grow up to between long. They are narrower than Iris spuria subsp. carthaliniae, (10‚Äì18 mm wide). It has a stiff stem, that can grow up to between long. It has dark green, compact, slightly inflated, spathes (leaves of the flower bud). The stems hold between 2‚Äì5 terminal (top of stem) flowers, in late spring. The flowers come in shades of blue, from dark blue, to blue-violet. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'.} The narrow falls have blade that is the shorter than the claw (section of petal closest to the stem). The petals are veined with darker colours or white. The capsules and seeds produced by the plant after flowering, have not been generally described. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=38. It was counted as 2n=38, by O.I. Zakharyeva and L.M. Makushenko in 1969. Taxonomy It is commonly known as Dimitry iris in Russia. It is known as Iris Demetriou in Czechoslovakia. It is unknown what the Latin specific epithet demetrii refers to, but an insect (beetle) Chioneosoma demetrii, also shares the same epithet.Ivan L√∂bl and Daniel L√∂bl (editors) It was originally published and described by Agazi Asaturovich Achverdov and Nina Vasilevna Mirzoeva as Iris demetrii in Transactions of Bot. Inst. Acad. Sci. Armenia SSR (Trudy Bot. Inst. Akad. Nauk Armyansk) Vol. 7 page 27, in 1950. It was named in 1950 (identical to Iris prilipkoana but not officially described). Iris prilipkoana was later classified as a synonym of Iris spuria subsp. demetrii. Later, in 1981 Brian Mathew re-classified the species as a subspecies of Iris spuria, and published it as Iris spuria subsp. demetrii (Fomin ) B.Mathew, in (his book The Iris on page 117 in 1981. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 9 January 2003 and then updated on 1 March 2007. Iris spuria subsp. demetrii is a tentatively accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate regions of Asia. =Range= It is found in the Transcaucasia regions, of Armenia, and Azerbaijan. In Armenia, it is found in Zangezur. =Habitat= Similar to Iris notha it grows on dry slopes, on the foothills and mountains of Azerbaijan, and Armenia. It has been found at altitudes of 2000 m above sea level. Conservation Due to the wide distribution of the species within Armenia, has helped protect the plants survive various threats, including being picked for flower bouquets. It was listed in the 1st edition of the Red Data Book of Armenia, under Iris prilipkoana (a synonym of Iris spuria subsp. demetrii) as 'Near Threatened' (NT). It was also listed in the Azerbaijan Red Data Book. It is not included in the Annexes of CITES and the Bern Convention. Cultivation It prefers to grow in rich, well-drained soil. Including clay soils. It dislikes wet soils. It also prefers positions in full sun or part shade. It can be susceptible to mustard-seed fungus. =Hybrids and cultivars= Due to its habit of liking dry soils, it is of interest to iris plant breeders. References Sources * Czerepanov, S. K. 1995.

Life The second son of James Morrison (1790‚Äì1857) the textile businessman, he inherited from his father a large fortune. He went to the University of Edinburgh, and spent a student year at Trinity College, Cambridge, travelled, and later unsuccessfully stood for parliament. Morrison was High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1857. He died at Fonthill Gifford, Wiltshire, on 22 December 1897, at the age of 76. Works The \\"Fonthill Casket\\", an iron cassone, damascened with gold and silver: the first of Morrison's commissions from the Spanish metalworker Pl√°cido Zuloaga Morrison's houses at Fonthill and on Carlton House Terrace, London, contained Persian carpets, Chinese porcelain, Greek gems and gold work, and miniatures. He employed craftsmen on cameo-cutting, inlaying of metals and enamelled glass. In 1868 he was contacted by Spanish metalworker Pl√°cido Zuloaga, administrator of a factory that had lost royal commission. Over the next twenty years Morrison commissioned a variety of damascened art works from Zuloaga, who led a team of artisans in making elaborate art works almost exclusively for Morrison. These included a cassone which became known as the Fonthill Casket. Between 1860 and 1878 Morrison formed a collection of engravings, of which a part was described in a printed Annotated Catalogue and Index to Portraits by M. Holloway (1868). His paintings included Clouet and Goya. The main interest of his later life was in autographs and letters, catalogued as: * Catalogue of the Collection of Autograph Letters and Historical Documents formed between 1865 and 1882, compiled and annotated under the direction of A. W. Thibaudeau, printed for private circulation, 1883‚Äì92, 6 vols. * Second series, 1882‚Äì93, 1893‚Äì6, A to D, 3 vols. This is without facsimiles but with a more of the text of the documents. * The Hamilton and Nelson Papers, 1756‚Äì1815, 1893‚Äì4, 2 vols. * The Blessington Papers, 1896. * The Bulstrode Papers, vol. i., 1667-76 [London, 1897]. The correspondence between Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton was for the first time fully printed in his catalogue. The papers of Sir Richard Bulstrode, who died in 1711 at the age of 101, contain his newsletters which overlap with Pepys's Diary. Many of the Spanish metalworks from Morrison's collection are now owned by the British-Iranian scholar, collector and philanthropist Nasser D. Khalili, forming the Khalili Collection of Spanish Damascene Metalwork. Family Morrrison married, in 1860, Mabel, daughter of the Rev. R. S. C. Chermside, rector of Wilton, Wiltshire. His wife survived him with two sons, Hugh and James Archibald who were both Members of Parliament, and two daughters.

The phenomenon revealed differences in human colour perception, which have been the subject of ongoing scientific investigations into neuroscience and vision science, with a number of papers published in peer-reviewed science journals. The photo originated from a washed-out colour photograph of a dress posted on the social networking service Facebook. Within the first week after the surfacing of the image, more than 10 million tweets mentioned the dress, using hashtags such as #thedress, #whiteandgold, and #blackandblue. Although the colour of the dress was eventually confirmed as black and blue, the image prompted many discussions, with users debating their opinions on the colour and how they perceived the dress in the photograph as a certain colour. Members of the scientific community began to investigate the photo for fresh insights into human colour vision. The dress itself, which was identified as a product of the retailer Roman Originals, experienced a major surge in sales as a result of the incident. The retailer also produced a one-off version of the dress in white and gold as a charity campaign. Origin About a week before the wedding of couple Grace and Keir Johnston of Colonsay, Scotland, the bride's mother, Cecilia Bleasdale, took a photograph of a dress at Cheshire Oaks mall north of Chester, England, that she planned to wear to the wedding and sent it to her daughter. After disagreements over the perceived colour of the dress in the photograph, the bride posted the image on Facebook, and her friends also disagreed over the colour; some saw it as white with gold lace, while others saw it as blue with black lace. For a week, the debate became well known in Colonsay, a small island community. On the day of the wedding, Caitlin McNeill, a friend of the bride and groom and a member of the Scottish folk music group Canach, performed with her band at the wedding on Colonsay. Even after seeing that the dress was \\"obviously blue and black\\" in real life, the musicians remained preoccupied by the photograph; they said they almost failed to make it on stage because they were caught up discussing the dress. A few days later, on 26 February, McNeill reposted the image to her blog on Tumblr and posed the same question to her followers, which led to further public discussion surrounding the image. Response =Initial viral spread= Cates Holderness, who ran the Tumblr page for Buzzfeed at the site's New York offices, noted a message from McNeill asking for the site's help in resolving the colour dispute of the dress. At the time she dismissed it, but then checked the page near the end of her workday and saw that it had received around 5,000 notes in that time, which she said \\"is insanely viral [for Tumblr]\\". Tom Christ, Tumblr's director of data, said at its peak the page was getting 14,000 views a second (or 840,000 views per minute), well over the normal rates for content on the site. By later that night, the number of total notes had increased tenfold. Holderness showed the picture to other members of the site's social media team, who immediately began arguing about the dress's colours amongst themselves. After creating a simple poll for users of the site, she left work and took the subway back to her Brooklyn home. When she got off the train and checked her phone, it was overwhelmed by the messages on various sites. \\"I couldn't open Twitter because it kept crashing. I thought somebody had died, maybe. I didn't know what was going on.\\" Later in the evening the page set a new record at BuzzFeed for concurrent visitors, which would reach 673,000 at its peak. The viral image became a worldwide Internet meme across social media. On Twitter, users created the hashtags \\"#whiteandgold,\\" \\"#blueandblack,\\" and \\"#dressgate\\" to discuss their opinions on what the colour of the dress was, and theories surrounding their arguments. The number of tweets about the dress increased throughout the night; at 6:36 pm EST, when the first increase in the number of tweets about the dress occurred, there were five thousand tweets per minute using the hashtag \\"#TheDress,\\" increasing to 11,000 tweets per minute with the hashtag by 8:31 pm. EST. The photo also attracted discussion relating to the triviality of the matter as a whole; The Washington Post described the dispute as \\"[the] drama that divided a planet\\". Some articles humorously suggested that the dress could prompt an \\"existential crisis\\" over the nature of sight and reality, or that the debate could harm interpersonal relationships. Others examined why people were making such a big argument over a seemingly trivial matter. =Overnight popularity= That evening, Wellesley College neuroscientist Bevil Conway gave some comments on the phenomenon to Wired reporter Adam Rogers. Before they hung up, Rogers warned him, \\"your tomorrow will not be the same\\". Conway thought the reporter was exaggerating, saying, \\"I didn't appreciate the full extent of what was about to happen. Not even close.\\" Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway woke up the next morning, his inbox had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations. \\"I did 10 interviews and had to have a colleague take my class that day,\\" said Conway. Celebrities with larger Twitter followings began to weigh in overnight. Taylor Swift's tweet‚Äîwhich described how while she saw it as blue and black, the whole thing left her \\"confused and scared\\"‚Äîwas retweeted 111,134 times and liked 154,188 times. Jaden Smith, Frankie Muniz, Demi Lovato, Mindy Kaling, and Justin Bieber agreed that the dress was blue and black, while Anna Kendrick, B. J. Novak, Katy Perry, Julianne Moore, and Sarah Hyland saw it as white and gold. Kim Kardashian tweeted that she saw it as white and gold, while her husband Kanye West saw it as blue and black. Lucy Hale, Phoebe Tonkin, and Katie Nolan saw different colour schemes at different times. Lady Gaga described the dress as \\"periwinkle and sand,\\" while David Duchovny called it teal. Other celebrities, including Ellen DeGeneres and Ariana Grande, mentioned the dress on social media without mentioning specific colours. Politicians, government agencies and social media platforms of well-known brands also weighed in tongue-in-cheek on the issue. Ultimately, the dress was the subject of 4.4 million tweets within 24 hours. In the UK, where the phenomenon had begun, Ian Johnson, creative manager for dress manufacturer Roman Originals, learned of the controversy from his Facebook news feed that morning. \\"I was pretty gobsmacked. I just laughed and told the wife that I'd better get to work,\\" he said. Businesses that had nothing to do with the dress, or even the clothing industry, devoted social media attention to the phenomenon. Adobe retweeted another Twitter user who had used some of the company's apps to isolate the dress's colours. \\"We jumped in the conversation and thought, Let's see what happens,\\" recalled Karen Do, the company's senior manager for social media. Jenna Bromberg, senior digital brand manager for Pizza Hut, saw the dress as white and gold and quickly sent out a tweet with a picture of pizza noting that it, too, was the same colours. Do called it \\"literally a tweet heard around the world\\". Ben Fischer of the New York Business Journal reported that interest in the first BuzzFeed article about the dress exhibited vertical growth instead of the typical bell curve of a viral phenomenon, leading BuzzFeed to assign two editorial teams to generate additional articles about the dress to drive ad revenue, and by 1 March, the original BuzzFeed article had received over 37 million views. The dress was cited by CNN commentator Mel Robbins as a viral phenomenon having the requisite qualities of positivity bias incorporating \\"awe, laughter and amusement,\\" and was compared to and contrasted with the llama chase earlier that day, as well as to tributes paid to actor Leonard Nimoy after his death the following day. =Real colours of dress confirmed= The dress itself was confirmed as a royal blue \\"Lace Bodycon Dress\\" from the retailer Roman Originals, which was actually black-and-blue in colour; although available in three other colours (red, pink, and ivory, each with black lace), a white and gold version was not available at the time. The day after McNeil's post, Roman Originals' website experienced a major surge in traffic; a representative of the retailer stated that \\"we sold out of the dress in the first 30 minutes of our business day and after restocking it, it's become phenomenal\\". On 28 February, Roman announced that they would make a single white and gold dress for a Comic Relief charity auction. On 3 March, Ellen DeGeneres had Grace, Keir, Ceitlin, and Cecelia as guests on her show. After revealing that she sees the dress as white and gold, DeGeneres presented each of them with gifts of underwear patterned after the dress but combining both colour schemes, and show sponsors also gave the Johnstons a gift of $10,000 and a honeymoon trip to Grenada, as they had left their honeymoon early to participate in the show. By 1 March, over two-thirds of BuzzFeed users polled responded that the dress was white and gold. Some people have suggested that the dress changes colours on its own. Media outlets noted that the photo was overexposed and had poor white balance, causing its colours to be washed out, giving rise to the perception by some that the dress is white and gold rather than its actual colours. Scientific explanations thumbrightTwo ways in which the photograph of The dress may be perceived: There is currently no consensus on why the dress elicits such discordant colour perceptions among viewers, though these have been confirmed and characterized in controlled experiments (described below). No synthetic stimuli have been constructed that are able to replicate the effect as clearly as the original image. Neuroscientists Bevil Conway and Jay Neitz believe that the differences in opinions are a result of how the human brain perceives colour, and chromatic adaptation. Conway believes that it has a connection to how the brain processes the various hues of a daylight sky: \\"Your visual system is looking at this thing, and you're trying to discount the chromatic bias of the daylight axis... people either discount the blue side, in which case they end up seeing white and gold, or discount the gold side, in which case they end up with blue and black.\\" Neitz said: > Our visual system is supposed to throw away information about the illuminant > and extract information about the actual reflectance... but I've studied > individual differences in colour vision for 30 years, and this is one of the > biggest individual differences I've ever seen. Similar theories have been expounded by the University of Liverpool's Paul Knox, who stated that what the brain interprets as colour may be affected by the device the photograph is viewed on, or the viewer's own expectations. Anya Hurlbert and collaborators also considered the problem from the perspective of colour perception. They attributed the differences in perception to individual perception of colour constancy. duck-rabbit, described in Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (1953) Neuroscientist and psychologist Pascal Wallisch states that while inherently ambiguous stimuli have been known to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was brought to the attention of science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous, as the stimulus is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit‚Äìduck illusion. The Journal of Vision, a scientific journal about vision research, announced in March 2015 that a special issue about the dress would be published with the title A Dress Rehearsal for Vision Science. The first large-scale scientific study on the dress was published in Current Biology three months after the image went viral. The study, which involved 1,400 respondents, found that 57% saw the dress as blue and black; 30% saw it as white and gold; 11% saw it as blue and brown; and 10% could switch between any of the colour combinations. A small number saw it as blue and gold. Women and older people disproportionately saw the dress as white and gold. The researchers further found that if the dress was shown in artificial yellow-coloured lighting almost all respondents saw the dress as black and blue, while they saw it as white and gold if the simulated lighting had a blue bias. Another study in the Journal of Vision, by Pascal Wallisch, found that people who were early risers were more likely to think the dress was lit by natural light, perceiving it as white and gold, and that \\"night owls\\" saw the dress as blue and black. A study carried out by Schlaffke et al. reported that individuals who saw the dress as white and gold showed increased activity in the frontal and parietal regions of the brain. These areas are thought to be critical in higher cognition activities. Legacy The dress was included on multiple year-end lists of notable internet memes in 2015. As the original authors of the photograph that sparked the viral phenomenon, Bleasdale and her partner Paul Jinks later expressed frustration and regret over being \\"completely left out from the story\\", including their lack of control over the story, the omission of their role in the discovery, and the commercial use of the photograph. In South Africa, the Salvation Army attempted to re-direct some of the mass awareness generated by the dress towards the issue of domestic violence.

It is a subspecies of Iris spuria and is a rhizomatous perennial plant, from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey in Asia with flowers in various shades of blue, but there are rare white forms. They have a yellow centre and darker veining. It has the common name of 'Muslim iris'. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It has a thin or stout, creeping rhizome. It has linear, lanceolate, sword-like, leaves. That are blue-green, grey-green or dark green. The leaves are normally wider than Iris notha,British Iris Society (1997) at wide, and they can grow up to long. They are shorter than the flowering stem. It has an erect, strong, straight stem that can grow up to between tall.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) It has thick, linear, lanceolate, spathes (leaves of the flower bud). That are 13 mm wide and have a white membranous edge. The stems hold several, terminal (top of stem) flowers, in late spring, or summer, between May and July. It has flowers that are up to in diameter, they come in various shades of blue including deep blue, deep violet, lavender, purple, and very rarely, white. They are very similar in colour to Iris spuria subsp. demetrii, and similar in form to Iris sibirica, but slightly larger with wider petals. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'. The falls have an elliptical blade, and then a narrow claw (section closest to the stem), which is equal or slight longer than the blade. The blade has a yellow or white central stripe or signal area, around it are darker veins heading to the edges. They are long. The upright, lanceolate, standards are a single colour, they gradually narrow to the claw (near the stem). It has a perianth tube that is shorter than the ovary. It has also style branches that are as long as the claw of the falls. After the iris has flowered, it produces an oblong cylindrical capsule, with 6 angles, that has a long spout like appendage. It fruits between August and September. Inside the capsule are, flat, semi- circular or reniform (kidney shaped), off-white to pale brown. =Biochemistry= In 1988, a study was carried out on the rhizomes of Iris spuria subsp. musulmanica, and found a chemical compound ( 12a-hydroxyrotenoid ). In 2005, the seeds of the iris were studied in Turkey. Along with a morphological and anatomical investigation. The oil content and methyl esters of fatty acids of the seed were also examined. They contained linoleic acid (40%) and oleic acid (30%). As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.} It has a chromosome count: 2n=44.  Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet musulmanica is derived from Musulman (the Persian word for Muslim). It has the common name of 'Muslim iris'. It was original published as Iris musulmanica by Aleksandr Vasiljevich Fomin in Vƒïstnik Tiflisskago Botaniceskago Sada. Moniteur du Jardin Botanique de Tiflis (Vƒïstn. Tiflissk. Bot. Sada) xiv. 46 in 1909. It was later re-classified as a subspecies of Iris spuria, as Iris spuria subsp. musulmanica by Armen Takhtajan in Flora Erevana: opredelitel dik orastushdikh rastenii Araratskoi Kotloving (Fl. Erevana) edit.2 on page 330 in 1972. It was later publisher and illustrated in 'Flora Iranica' (Edited by Rechinger), within Iridaceae (chapter), plate12 in 1975. It was then published by Brian Mathew, in his book 'The Iris' on page 20 in 1981. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 9 January 2003, and then updated on 3 December 2004. Iris spuria subsp. musulmanica is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native temperate regions of Asia. =Range= It is found within Iran, and Turkey, or Asia Minor. It is found in the Caucasus regions, of Armenia, Transcaucasia, and Azerbaijan. =Habitat= It grows in damp meadows, marshes, in saline soils, and in the grassy plains by rivers. It is found in a wide zone between the lowlands and the uplands. It can create huge colonies of plants. Conservation In Armenia, it is rare and grows in the salt marshes of the Ararat Valley (between Mount Ararat and Mount Aragats) with other endemic species including, Linum seljukorum, Inula aucheriana, Sonchus araraticus, Orchis laxiflora and Merendera sobolifera. It is listed in the Azerbaijan Red Data Book. Cultivation It is hardy, and can survive most winters without shelter. Although is less robust than Iris orientalis and Iris xanthospuria. It is hardy to Europe Zone H2. It can be grown in most nutrient rich garden soils. Soils that Iris siberica grow in are suitable for Iris spuria subsp. musulmanica. It prefers positions in full sun or partial shade. It can be grown in either a rockery or sunny flower border. In Turkey, Iris spuria subsp. musulmanica, with Narcissus poeticus and Tulipa sylvestris are used as ornamental plants in parks and gardens in the region.Bilge ≈ûene (Editor) The iris is susceptible to slug damage. It is only normally found with specialised Iris growers or nurseries. =Propagation= It can also be propagated by division or by seed growing.

In response, a group of die- hard persons from the militia and Gilgit scouts were trained. They formed new directorate of ISI. Their main task was to counter the influence of Faqir of Ipi and to delay any Afghan incursion until the main force of the Pakistan Army arrives. Until November 1954 unit was mostly aimed to counter insurgency in Waziristan but after that, its role was slowly expanded new unit was raised in East Pakistan in order to assist insurgents in India's North-East. Its role was expanded in the late 1980s to assist the Khalistan Movement, headed by Jagjit Singh Chauhan. In the 1960s they were known to West but only their name but in 1980 the unit received training from CIA to assisted Afghan Mujahideen after the Soviet invasion. The unit also took part in many battles against Soviets. Little is known about unit as it is one of the most classified elements of the Pakistan Defense establishment, working with a limited number of senior officers.  Training  CAD operatives are trained in home developed tactics. They are also trained in to a high level of proficiency in the use and tactical employment of an unusually wide degree of modern weaponry, IEDs and IWs IITM, explosive devices and firearms (foreign and domestic), hand-to-hand combat, high performance/tactical driving (on and off- road), apprehension avoidance (including picking handcuffs and escaping from confinement), improvised explosive devices, cyber warfare, covert channels, parachuting, SCUBA diving, proficiency in foreign languages, surreptitious entry operations (picking or otherwise bypassing locks), vehicle hot-wiring, survival, evasion, resistance and escape (SERE), extreme survival and wilderness training, combat EMS medical training, tactical communications, and tracking.

They continued further to say that they were worried that the recordings would have a hollow sound to them but they did not. They finish by saying \\"another top-notch release from the Irish worshipers and a successful first foray into live recordings.\\" Stephanie Ford, a reviewer for the Houghton Star had positive words for the album. She was impressed that the album was recorded around an actual campfire in Ireland saying \\"Rend Collective pushed artistic boundaries through their acoustic live recording.\\" She reports that some of the songs have a very upbeat Irish foot stomping feel, while others still retain the Irish feel but slow down to a meditative tempo. She mentioned that the lyrics add a layer of depth to the David Crowder like energy creating what she calls \\"a heart-felt cry to God\\" Jonathan Andre of Indie Vision Music also had positive things to say, placing the album in his top three favorites of the year.

Those last years (2018-2019), the situation got better slowly and the conditions became more acceptable, this led a short while later the augmentation of 19,2 % of the inscriptions and the kindergarten and primary sectors got influenced the most, this is explained by the willingness of parents to adapt their kids to the French system from their youngest age. The primary and high school sectors even today: Results: Despite the critical conditions that the students went through, the results proved the efficiency of the system and surpasses the average grades of the AEFE as well as some cases in France.

In 2012, he won The Bobs-Best of Online Activism award from Deutsche Welle, who stated that \\"Asif's blog was one of the most read web pages in Bangladesh and is known for its strong criticism of Islamic fundamentalism in Bangladesh's \\"anti-people politics\\". On 15 January 2013, he survived an assassination attempt by Islamic extremists. A few months later, he was imprisoned twice by the Bangladesh Government for posting \\"offensive comments about Islam and Mohammad\\". Due to sustained international pressure, Mohiuddin was released, after which he fled from his country to Germany in 2014. In 2015, he received the Anna Politkovskaya Award for Journalism.  Biography  = Youth and education = Mohiuddin was born and raised a Muslim family in Dhaka as the son of a middle-ranking civil servant. Studying religion at the mosque after school, he said \\"I learned many ridiculous things ‚Äì that I would get virgins in heaven, or that I would suffer the ultimate punishment in hell for eternity.\\" To the grief of his parents, he increasingly questioned the religious doctrines he had been taught. Because of the critical questions and his irreverent answers towards the teachers, he was often hashly beaten up by them. At the age of 13, he declared himself an atheist. Mohiuddin began to read about science, and from age 16 (2000) started to challenge allegedly unscientific claims made by Islamists by writing opinion pieces in Dhaka newspapers. This started when he read an article in a science magazine in Bengali that attempted to reconcile the miracles described in the Quran with modern science and in some way explain in a rational scientific manner. Mohiuddin wrote a contribution in response, claiming that it was scientifically impossible that the prophet Muhammad flew to heaven on a horse. This and other critical to ironic contributions in Bengali newspapers from Dhaka gave rise to his reputation as a freethinker and a critic of religion. It also brought him into contact with other similarly-minded online activists. The school beatings persisted until he went to college. There, he began to engage himself in politics, against police violence, for women's rights and for more democracy. In 2006 he started blogging. In 2008 he obtained a degree in computer science. Mohiuddin organised the first meeting of Bangladeshi freethinkers, atheists, agnostics and other nonbelievers in Dhaka in 2010, which was attended by 34 people.Asif Mohiuddin speaking in Utrecht, Netherlands, 30 July 2016 = Attack and imprisonment = Mohiuddin wrote articles criticising male chauvinism, domestic violence and the death penalty for apostasy in Islam, leading to fundamentalists calling for his death. In 2013 Mohiuddin was attacked and stabbed outside his house by four youths, inspired by Al-Qaeda leader Anwar Al-Awlaki. A month later, Bangladeshi bloggers and online activists started the 2013 Shahbag protests, leading to Islamist groups, including Hefazat-e-Islam, assembling over a million people in counter-demonstrations that called for blasphemy laws in the country, and attacks on secularists in Bangladesh. Rewards were offered for anyone who would behead secularist bloggers. The secular Bangladeshi government imprisoned bloggers, including Mohiuddin, and blocked many websites. Asif Mohiuddin speaking at the American Atheist Convention 2015. In March 2013 Mohiuddin's blog on the public blogging site somewhereinblog.net, The current blog page reads: \\"blog has been withdrawn or cancelled for violating terms and conditions\\" (transl.) was shut down by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, a move protested by the 2013 Bengali blog blackout. In April, Mohiuddin was arrested for \\"blasphemous\\" posts, along with three other bloggers. The crackdown on independent blogs, and the closure of the newspaper Amar Desh, was strongly criticised by Human Rights Watch and IHEU. Shortly after the bloggers were arrested, Mukto-Mona, an independent site of freethinkers and atheists of mainly Bengali and South Asian descent, issued a statement titled, 'Bangladesh government squishing freedom of speech by arresting and harassing young bloggers inside the country'. Amnesty International also issued a statement titled, 'Bangladesh: writers at risk of torture‚Äô. The Center for Inquiry (CFI), requested the US Secretary of State John Kerry \\"pressure the government of Bangladesh to reverse its policy of arresting atheist bloggers who were critical to religion.\\" They sent a letter to Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Suzan Johnson Cook \\"to do all they can to raise public awareness of this situation.\\" Other influential organisations such as the Free Society Institute of South Africa, Reporters Without Borders, Committee to Protect Journalists, Global Voice Advocacy, and several other bodies also called for the immediate release of the Bangladeshi bloggers and appealed to several foreign authorities to press Bangladesh on the issue. Worldwide protest and demonstrations were held on 25 April and 2 May 2013, to put pressure on the Bangladeshi government to free the arrested bloggers. Several humanist groups (including CFU, CFI-Canada, the British Humanist Association, American Atheists, Secular Coalition for America, and Freethinkers of University of Missouri's campus) took part in cities the US, Canada, the UK, and Bangladesh. Many writers, activists, and prominent intellectuals around the world including Salman Rushdie, Taslima Nasrin, Hemant Mehta, Maryam Namazie, PZ Myers, Avijit Roy, Anu Muhammad, Ajoy Roy, Qayyum Chowdhury, Ramendu Majumdar, Muhammad Zafar Iqbal publicly expressed their solidarity with the arrested bloggers. Three of the arrested bloggers eventually were released on bail, however the court denied bail for Asif Mohiuddin and he was sent to prison on 2 June 2013. He was released after three months but still faces charges. Now he lives in Berlin, Germany. = Flight to Germany and continued activism = Since April 2014, Asif Mohiuddin lives in Germany, initially with a scholarship from the Hamburg-based Stiftung f√ºr politisch Verfolgte (Foundation for the Politically Repressed) and later also with the support of Amnesty International. In an interview with Deutsche Welle in April 2014 he stated that he does not feel completely safe in Germany either. Just a few days before, someone posted on Facebook a call to travel to Germany and kill him. The post received 1200 likes and was shared many times. Even with some Muslims living in Germany or migrants from Muslim-majority countries to Germany, his views have been met with a strong rejection. After his one-year scholarship, Mohiuddin decided to stay in Germany, instead of returning to Bangladesh as planned. By that time, he had become the Islamists' \\"Enemy no. #1\\". Mohiuddin did not change his Internet activities. Because of the closure of his old blog, he resumed spreading his views on Facebook and other online channels. He is engaged as a speaker at various congresses and events, including the American Atheists National Convention in Memphis, Tennessee on 29 June 2015. = Anti-state case = On May 5, 2020, under the Digital Security Act, RAB-3 Warrant Officer Mohammad Abu Bakar Siddique accused a Facebook page called \\"I am Bangladeshi\\" of spreading anti-state propagation, rumour about epidemic corona, spreading rumors with cartoons of various leaders of the ruling party and creating confusion among the people. A case was filed against 11 convicts, of which six people were accused of running the page and also five others were made convict, including Asif Mohiuddin, who were accused of having private conversations with them on WhatsApp and Messenger.  Impact  The assassination attempt against Mohiuddin in January 2013, that was widely covered at home and abroad, was in a sense the public launch of a series of murders of bloggers, secularists and critics of Islamism in Bangladesh, which continues to this day, claiming 48 casualties (July 2016) so far. Mohiuddin also attributes the fact that he has survived to why he has attracted a great deal of international attention. In particular, the English-language service of Deutsche Welle reported many times about him.Deutsche Welle coverage of Asif Mohiuddin  See also  * Avijit Roy and Bonya Ahmed * Kaberi Gain * Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh  References  Category:Living people Category:1984 births Category:Bangladeshi atheists Category:Bangladeshi bloggers Category:Bangladeshi emigrants to Germany Category:Bangladeshi secularists Category:Bangladeshi humanists Category:Bangladeshi former Muslims Category:Former Muslim critics of Islam Category:Attacks on secularists in Bangladesh Category:Opposition to Islam in Germany ","title":"Asif Mohiuddin"},{"id":"45525176","text":"This is a list of Polish television related events from 2014.

Ground-breaking in Western fiction for being written from the native rather than the colonial point of view, it is also an influential work of Sri Lankan literature. It was republished by Eland in 2008.  Background  Leonard Woolf worked for the British Ceylon Civil Service in Sri Lanka for seven years after graduating from Cambridge University in 1904. In Cambridge Woolf had met and befriended members of the Bloomsbury Group. He became Assistant Government Agent in Hambantota District, dealing with a variety of administrative and judicial issues. The district he was in charge of had a population of 100,000 people. Books he took with him to Sri Lanka included the complete works of Voltaire. Woolf also kept a comprehensive diary while there, and later said that his experiences in the country led to him adopting liberal political views and becoming an opponent of imperialism. He wrote The Village in the Jungle, his first novel, after he returned from Sri Lanka to England in 1911 while he was courting his future wife Virginia Stephen. He dedicated the novel to her.  Plot  The novel describes the lives of a poor family in a small village called Beddagama (literally, \\"The village in the jungle\\") as they struggle to survive the challenges presented by poverty, disease, superstition, the unsympathetic colonial system, and the jungle itself. The head of the family is a farmer named Silindu, who has two daughters named Punchi Menika and Hinnihami. After being manipulated by the village authorities and a debt collector, Silindu is put on trial for murder.  Reception and influence  Written two decades before George Orwell's much better known anti-imperialist novel Burmese Days, The Village in the Jungle has been described by Nick Rankin as \\"the first novel in English literature to be written from the indigenous point of view rather than the coloniser's.\\" Victoria Glendinning described it as \\"a foundational novel in the Sri Lankan literary canon\\", but the novel remains little known in the wider world. In 1980 a Sinhalese language film entitled Beddegama was released based on the novel.

It was sponsored by the French Army and all the cyclists were professional soldiers. After competing with success in the French amateur structure, the team was registered as a Continental-level team from the beginning of the 2015 road cycling season until its disbandment at the end of the 2017 season.http://www.cqranking.com/men/asp/gen/team.asp?year=2017&teamcode;=ADT  History  = Amateur racing = The team was founded in 2010 by David Lima Da-Costa following a long history of the French Army supporting soldiers in their cycling careers, with the team's first season of racing being the 2012 cycling season. It was founded with the intention of aiding in the Army's recruitment efforts. The team offered unusual benefits to its riders, such as a potential career in the Army, accommodation and training facilities rarely provided by a domestic team. The team received approximately 40 applications from riders wishing to join it for its first season, which included top-level amateurs and some professional riders. The hiring process was made more complicated by the requirement to enlist the riders as soldiers. Arm√©e de terre riders at the 2013 Tour Alsace The team had a budget that would have supported a Continental team, but the management initially chose to set the team up to compete in the French domestic championship, the Division Nationale. In the team's first season, it finished fourth in the second division of the Division Nationale and was promoted to the first division for the 2012 season. After 22 victories in 2012, the team finished a close second in the 2013 Coupe de France Division Nationale 1, finishing behind Vend√©e U despite leading for three quarters of the season. The team went on to dominate the 2014 domestic racing season in France, winning 61 races as they won the amateur Coupe de France. = Continental team = Having received continued support from the military leadership for another four years, the team began exploring promotion to become a UCI Continental team, with support from civilian sponsors. The success of this application was announced in December 2014, with the team finding out through a leak to the press. This promotion was complicated by the rules about French cyclists. Riders on UCI Continental teams are not considered professionals by the UCI, but the rules of French cycling mandate professional contracts for them. Since the riders on Arm√©e de terre are soldiers rather than professional cyclists, a special exception had to be made to allow the team to compete. The team retained several of its riders from the 2014 season into the international ranks, including French under-23 champion Yann Guyot. The riders continued to live in the team's base, two to each room; if a race did not provide accommodation to the riders, they stayed in the nearest military barracks. Each rider did military training in the two months of the off-season, learning a military specialism as well as training as a cyclist. The team's jersey in this as in previous years is a camouflage design promoting the team's military foundation. The team's bicycles, provided by Mario Cipollini's company, are also decorated with a camouflage pattern. The team made its debut at this level in the 2.1-ranked √âtoile de Bess√®ges. They then rode the 2015 Tour du Haut Var, where Quentin Pacher finished fifteenth overall and won the white jersey for the best young rider. The following weekend, the team achieved top 10 results in two French races: eighth place in the Classic Sud-Ard√®che for Romain Combaud and seventh in the La Dr√¥me Classic for Yann Guyot, who was the leading group behind the race winner, Samuel Dumoulin (). The team's first victory came at the Tour du Loir-et-Cher, where Guyot won stage 3 in a two-man sprint.  Team roster  = Riders' military ranks = As the members of the Arm√©e de terre team were all soldiers as well as cyclists, they all had military ranks. Most of them were graded as soldat de deuxi√®me classe, the lowest rank in the French Army. Barbas, Le Roux and Levasseur were soldats de premi√®re classe, the next highest rank; Combaud and Guyot were caporaux, while Sinner held the equivalent rank of brigadier; Canal was a caporal-chef. The highest-ranked rider was Julien Gonnet, who was a sergent-chef.

A British force comprising the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Bellona and 36-gun frigate HMS Brilliant was sailing from Lisbon to Britain with a cargo of specie when on 13 August they encountered a French force comprising the 74-gun Courageux and the 32-gun frigates Malicieuse and Hermine. The British ships immediately chased the French squadron, maintaining contact through the night, and on the following morning two separate engagements occurred as Brilliant fought the French frigates and Bellona battled Courageux. In a short but hard-fought engagement both ships of the line were damaged. The battle was decided when Bellonas captain, Robert Faulknor succeeded in manoeuvering his ship into a raking position, inflicting severe damage and appalling casualties on Courageux, forcing the French ship to surrender. Although outnumbered, Brilliant successfully held off the French frigates, preventing them from intervening in the battle between the ships of the line, Malicieuse and Hermine both successfully withdrew following the surrender of Courageux. Courageux was subsequently repaired and recommissioned in the Royal Navy, serving for 35 years in two later conflicts. Background Following their defeat Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759, the French Navy was no longer able to compete with the Royal Navy for control of European waters in the Seven Years' War.Clowes, p.232 In April 1761 the Royal Navy capitalised on its regional dominance to invade Belle √éle, an island off Brittany, which was captured in June.Clowes, p.236 With the main French Atlantic fleet confined to harbour, smaller squadrons were sent to conduct raiding operations. One squadron comprised the 74-gun ship of the line Courageux under Captain Dugu√© L'Ambert and the 32-gun frigates Malicieuse under Captain Longueville and Hermine under Captain Montigney, which was sent to the West Indies. After a very successful raiding cruise, the squadron returned to European Waters in early August. In the late evening of 13 August 1761 L'Ambert's squadron was sailing towards the Spanish coast, off Cape Finisterre, when sails were sighted close inshore to the north east. This was a British squadron of the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Bellona under Captain Robert Faulknor and 36-gun frigate HMS Brilliant under Captain John Loggie sailing from Lisbon to Britain with a cargo of more than ¬£100,000 in specie. The French initially identified both British ships as ships of the line and turned away in the face of perceived British superiority, attempting to escape in the darkness, but the bright moonlight enabled the British to remain in pursuit.Clowes, p.306 Battle At 05:00 on the morning of 14 August, L'Ambert changed his opinion of the strength of the British squadron, assuming that Bellona was a 50-gun fourth rate ship. Confident of victory, he turned his squadron back towards Faulknor's ships, ordering Malicieuse and Hermine to attack Brilliant while he led Courageux against Bellona. The ships of the line approached one another head on, L'Ambert pulling Courageux alongside Bellona at 06:25 and opening fire with his broadside at close range. Faulknor delayed his response until the second broadside, his crew firing two broadsides of their own in quick succession while he backed his sails, throwing Bellona into reverse and swinging alongside Courageux.Shelton, p.148 The French ship's gunnery was however more effective in the initial stages of the action, and Faulknor's mizenmast was brought crashing down nine minutes after the first gunfire. When a crewman expressed dismay at this damage, Faulknor was reported to have responded \\"Confound you! you rascal, what has a two-decked ship to do with a mizen-mast in the time of action. See and knock away his mizenmast.\\" A view from the deck of Bellona during the engagement with Courageux, by Frederick Whymper. Faulknor was now concerned that, with his ability to manoeuvere his ship compromised, L'Ambert might take the opportunity to escape, and he planned to initiate a boarding action to seize Courageux, but the French ship sheered away, her own mizenmast coming down at 06:45. Despite the severe damage to his sails and rigging, Faulknor then attempted to wear around, successfully bringing Bellona across the French ship's starboard stern quarter and firing a series of raking broadsides. These causes enormous damage to the hull of Courageux, killing and wounding hundreds of sailors and convincing the mortally wounded L'Ambert to strike his colours and surrender at 07:04. Some of the lower deck guns on the French ship had continued firing after the surrender, and Faulknor ordered two further broadsides to be fired into the shattered hull of Courageux to ensure its compliance. While Bellona and Courageux fought their duel, Brilliant successfully fought off the two French frigates from 06:00 to 07:30, attacked first by Malicieuse and then by Hermine in turn, deliberately preventing them from intervening in the battle between the larger ships. When it became clear that L'Ambert had surrendered, the French frigates made sail and retreated, Brilliant remaining with Bellona and their prize. British losses in the battle numbered six killed and 28 wounded on Bellona and five killed and 16 wounded on Brilliant, while losses on Courageux alone were listed in Faulknor's after action report as the very high figures of 240 killed and 110 wounded. Historian William Laird Clowes considers that this discrepancy was probably the result of differences in British and French tactical doctrine, the French trained to fire at the masts and rigging of an enemy ship in order to disable them, while British doctrine trained crews to fire into the hull of enemy ships to kill the crew.Clowes, p.307 Aftermath The captured Courageux was taken to Lisbon under a prize crew, to be greeted by cheering crowds. A later historian wrote \\"I can only compare the conduct of the Bellona to that of a dextrous gladiator, who not only plants his own blows with certainty, but also guards against those of his antagonist.\\" Writing in 1825, historian Edward Pelham Brenton listed the battle as one of only four decisive encounters between single ships of the line of comparable size in the history of warfare under sail (the others being the Battle of Ushant in 1782 when HMS Foudroyant captured P√©gase, the Battle of the Raz de Sein in April 1798, when HMS Mars captured Hercule and the Battle of Pirano in February 1812 when HMS Victorious captured Rivoli).Brenton, p. 388 Following repairs, Courageux joined the Royal Navy as HMS Courageux, serving for 35 years and seeing action in the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary Wars before being wrecked in a storm at Monte Hacho on 18 December 1796 with the loss of more than 470 lives.Grocott, p.41 References Bibliography  * Category:Naval battles involving France Category:Naval battles involving Great Britain Category:Conflicts in 1761 Category:Naval battles of the Seven Years' War Category:Battles in Galicia (Spain) ","title":"Battle of Cape Finisterre (1761)"},{"id":"45525645","text":"Team Illuminate is an American UCI Continental cycling team established in 2014.

It is a voluntary examination of operational resilience and cyber security practices offered at no cost by DHS to the operators of critical infrastructure and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. The CRR has a service-oriented approach, meaning that one of the foundational principles of the CRR is that an organization deploys its assets (people, information, technology, and facilities) to support specific operational missions (or services). The CRR is offered in a facilitated workshop format and as a self-assessment package. The workshop version of the CRR is led by a DHS facilitator at a critical infrastructure facility. The workshop typically takes 6‚Äì8 hours to complete and draws on a cross section of personnel from the critical infrastructure organization. All information collected in a facilitated CRR is protected from disclosure by the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. This information cannot be disclosed through a Freedom of Information Act request, used in civil litigation, or be used for regulatory purposes. The CRR Self-Assessment Package allows an organization to conduct an assessment without the need for direct DHS assistance. It is available for download from the DHS Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community Voluntary Program website. The package includes an automated data answer capture and report generation tool, a facilitation guide, comprehensive explanation of each question, and a crosswalk of CRR practices to the criteria of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. The questions asked in the CRR and the resulting report are the same in both versions of the assessment. DHS partnered with the CERT Division of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University to design and deploy the CRR. The goals and practices found in the assessment are derived from the CERT Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM) Version 1.0.Caralli, R., Allen, J.,& White, D. (2010) The CRR was introduced in 2009 and received a significant revision in 2014.Mehravari, N.(2014) Architecture The CRR comprises 42 goals and 141 specific practices extracted from the CERT-RMM and organized in 10 domains): # Asset Management # Controls Management # Configuration and Change Management # Vulnerability Management # Incident Management # Service Continuity Management # Risk Management # External Dependency Management # Training and Awareness # Situational Awareness Each domain is composed of a purpose statement, a set of specific goals and associated practice questions unique to the domain, and a standard set of Maturity Indicator Level (MIL) questions. The MIL questions examine the institutionalization of practices within an organization. The performance of an organization is scored against a MIL scale.Butkovic, M.,& Caralli, R. (2013) This scale depicts capability divided into five levels: MIL1-Incomplete, MIL2-Performed, MIL3-Managed, MIL4-Measured, and MIL5-Defined. Institutionalization means that cybersecurity practices become a deeper, more lasting part of the organization because they are managed and supported in meaningful ways. When cybersecurity practices become more institutionalized‚Äîor ‚Äúembedded‚Äù‚Äîmanagers can have more confidence in the practices‚Äô predictability and reliability. The practices also become more likely to be sustained during times of disruption or stress to the organization. Maturity can also lead to a tighter alignment between cybersecurity activities and the organization‚Äôs business drivers. For example, in more mature organizations, managers will provide oversight to the particular domain and evaluate the effectiveness of the security activities the domain comprises. The number of goals and practice questions varies by domain, but the set of MIL questions and the concepts they encompass are the same for all domains. All CRR questions have three possible responses: ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIncomplete. The CRR measures performance of an organization at the practice, goal, domain, and MIL levels. Scores are calculated for each of individual model elements and in aggregated totals. The scoring rubric establishes the following: # Practices can be observed in one of three states: performed, incomplete, and not performed. # A domain goal is achieved only if all of the practices related to the goal are achieved. # A domain is fully achieved only if all the goals in the domain are achieved. If the above conditions are met, the organization is said to be achieving the domain in a performed state: the practices that define the domain are observable, but no determination can be made about the degree to which these practices are # repeatable under varying conditions # consistently applied # able to produce predictable and acceptable outcomes # retained during times of stress These conditions are tested for by applying a common set of 13 MIL questions to the domain, but only after MIL1 is achieved. Consistent with the architecture of the MIL scale, MILs are cumulative; to achieve a MIL in a specific domain, an organization must perform all of the practices in that level and in the preceding MILs. For example, an organization must perform all of the domain practices in MIL1 and MIL2 to achieve MIL2 in the domain. Logo of the US Department of Homeland Security Cyber Resilience Review DHS Cyber Resilience Review Method Description and Self-Assessment User Guide Results CRR participants receive a comprehensive report containing results for each question in all domains. The report also provides graphical summaries of the organization‚Äôs performance at the goal and domain levels, depicted in a heat- map matrix. This detailed representation allows organizations to target improvement at a fine-grained level. Organizations participating in facilitated CRRs receives an additional set of graphs depicting the performance of their organization compared to all other prior participants. The CRR report includes a potential path toward improving the performance of each practice. These options for consideration are primarily sourced from the CERT-RMM and NIST special publications. Organizations can also use CRR results to measure their perform in relation to the criteria of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

It is located at the former site of the Hollywood Park Racetrack from LAX, immediately southeast of The Forum. Opened in September 2020, the stadium serves as the home for the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). It also serves as the home of the LA Bowl. It is scheduled to host WrestleMania 37 on March 28, 2021. It is also scheduled to host Super Bowl LVI in February 2022 and the College Football Playoff National Championship in January 2023. During the 2028 Summer Olympics, the stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies, soccer, and archery. SoFi Stadium is the fourth stadium, and second to be in current use, since the 1970 AFL‚ÄìNFL merger to be shared by two NFL teams (MetLife Stadium, in East Rutherford, New Jersey, is home to the New York Giants and New York Jets, its predecessor, Giants Stadium as well as Shea Stadium in 1975). It is the fourth facility in the Los Angeles area to host multiple teams from the same league as Staples Center is home to both of the city's National Basketball Association (NBA) teams, the Los Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers from 1999 to present, Dignity Health Sports Park for a time hosted both the LA Galaxy and now-defunct Chivas USA of Major League Soccer from 2005 to 2014 and Dodger Stadium hosted the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels from 1962 to 1965. The facility is a component of Hollywood Park, a master planned neighborhood in development on the site of the former racetrack. Hollywood Park Casino re-opened in a new building on the property in October 2016, becoming the development's first establishment to open.  Design  SoFi Stadium was designed by HKS; it features a fixed, translucent ETFE roof‚Äîdesigned to cover both the stadium proper and the adjacent pedestrian plaza. The roof also projects images that are seen from airplanes flying into LAX. The stadium bowl has open sides. The stadium seats 70,240 spectators for most events, with the ability to expand it with 30,000 additional seats for larger events. Another component of the stadium's design is \\"the Oculus\\"‚Äîan ovular, double-sided 4K HDR video board that is suspended from the roof over the field. The structure weighs , and displays 80 million pixels. The Oculus also houses the stadium's 260-speaker audio system as well as 56 5G wireless antennas. Chief technology officer Skarpi Hedinsson stated that SoFi Stadium would be the first stadium to have an end-to-end 4K video workflow. He emphasized the challenges that the Oculus would present in producing in-game content, stating that a team had been using virtual reality to help \\"understand how best to present content and how do we make sure that all the seating sections are in play as we put our images and our replay frames on the board.\\" History =Location discussions and beating the competition= The stadium site was previously home to Hollywood Park, later sold and referred to as Betfair Hollywood Park, which was a thoroughbred race course from 1938 until it was shut down for racing and training in December 2013. The casino remained open, containing a poker card room. Most of the complex was demolished in 2014 to make way for new construction with the rest demolished in late 2016 after the new Hollywood Park Casino was opened. The current stadium was not the first stadium proposed for the site. The site was almost home to an NFL stadium two decades earlier. In May 1995 after the departure of the Rams for St. Louis, the National Football League team owners approved, by a 27‚Äì1 vote with two abstentions, a resolution supporting a plan to build a $200 million, privately funded stadium on property owned by Hollywood Park for the Los Angeles Raiders. Al Davis, who was then the Raiders owner, balked and refused the deal over a stipulation that he would have had to accept a second team at the stadium. On January 31, 2014, the Los Angeles Times reported that Stan Kroenke, owner of the St. Louis Rams, purchased a parcel of land just north of the Hollywood Park site in an area that had been studied by the National Football League in the past and at one point attempted to purchase. This set off immediate speculation as to what Kroenke's intentions were for the site: it was originally planned to be a Walmart Supercenter; however, in 2014, most of the speculation centered on the site as a possible stadium site or training facility for the Rams. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell represented that Kroenke informed the league of the purchase. As an NFL owner, any purchase of land in which a potential stadium could be built must be disclosed to the league. Speculation about the Rams' returning to their home of nearly fifty years had already been discussed when Kroenke was one of the finalists in bidding for ownership in the Los Angeles Dodgers, but speculation increased when the news broke that the Rams owner had a possible stadium site in hand. 2015 aerial view of former racetrack and complex site, with the Downtown Los Angeles skyline in background Nearly a year went by without a word from Kroenke about his intentions for the land, as he failed to ever address the St. Louis media, or the Hollywood Park Land Company, about what the site may be used for. There was, however, speculation about the future of the Rams franchise until it was reported that the National Football League would not be allowing any franchise relocation for the 2015 season. On January 5, 2015, Stockbridge Capital Group, the owners of the Hollywood Park Land Company, announced that it had partnered with Kroenke Sports & Entertainment to add the northern parcel to the rest of the development project and build a multi-purpose 70,240-seat stadium designed for the NFL. On February 24, 2015, the Inglewood City Council approved the stadium plan and the initiative with construction on the stadium planned to begin in December 2015. The project would include the stadium and a performance arts venue attached to the stadium with up to 6,000 seats, while reconfiguring the previously approved Hollywood Park entertainment venue that includes plans for up to of retail, of office space, 2,500 new residential and condo units, a luxury hotel with over 300 rooms and of public parks, playgrounds, open space, a lake and pedestrian, bicycle and mass-transit access for future services. On February 24, 2015, the Inglewood City Council approved plans with a 5‚Äì0 unanimous vote to combine the plot of land with the larger Hollywood Park development and rezone the area to include sports and entertainment capabilities. This essentially cleared the way for developers to begin construction on the venue as planned in December 2015. It was also reported, in early February 2015, that \\"earth was being moved\\" and the site was being graded to be prepared for the construction that would begin later in the year. The project was competing directly with a rival proposal. On February 19, 2015, the Oakland Raiders and the San Diego Chargers announced plans for a privately financed $1.85 billion stadium that the two teams would have built in Carson if they were to move to the Los Angeles market. The project was, like the Inglewood project, also approved to move forward and cleared for development. The two projects spent the remainder of 2015 jockeying for the right to get approved by the NFL. = Construction = 2016 aerial view of the stadium construction site, adjacent to The Forum. The new Hollywood Park Casino is in the foreground. The NFL approved the Inglewood proposal and the Rams' relocation back to Los Angeles, 30‚Äì2, on January 12, 2016 over the rival proposal. On July 14, 2016, it was announced that Turner Construction and AECOM Hunt would oversee construction of the stadium and that the HKS, Inc. architect firm would design the stadium. On October 19, 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) determined that a tall LB 44 rotary drill rig would not pose a hazard to air navigation, so it approved the first of several pieces of heavy equipment to be used during construction. The stadium design had been under review by the FAA for more than a year because of concerns about how the structure would interact with radar at nearby Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). On December 16, 2016, it was reported in Sports Business Journal that the FAA had declined to issue permits for cranes needed to build the structure. \\"We‚Äôre not going to evaluate any crane applications until our concerns with the overall project are resolved,\\" said FAA spokesman Ian Gregor. The FAA had previously recommended building the stadium at another site due to the risks posed to LAX‚Äîechoing concerns raised by former United States Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge. The Rams held the groundbreaking construction ceremony at the stadium site on November 17, 2016. The ceremony featured NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Rams' owner Stan Kroenke. On December 23, 2016, the FAA approved the large construction cranes to build the stadium. September 2017 aerial view of the construction site On May 18, 2017, developers announced that record rainfall in the area had postponed the stadium's completion and opening from 2019 until the 2020 NFL season. On August 8, 2017, the LA Stadium Premiere Center opened in Playa Vista, featuring interactive multimedia displays and models showcasing the design and features of the new stadium (with a particular focus on prospective buyers of premium suites and seats at the facility). SoFi Stadium under construction in November 2018 In March 2018, the NFL announced that it would relocate its NFL Media unit (which manages the NFL's in-house media units, including NFL Network, digital properties, and NFL Films among other units) from Culver City to a new facility neighboring the stadium on the Hollywood Park site, which will include a studio capable of hosting audiences, as well as an outdoor studio. The new facility is expected to be completed in 2021. On June 26, 2018, the new stadium was ceremonially topped out. As of August 2019, one year before the planned opening, Rams chief operating officer Kevin Demoff stated that the stadium was 75% complete. In January 2020, Demoff stated that construction was now 85% complete, with roof construction, seat installation, and construction of the Oculus in progress. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders issued by the California state government in March 2020, construction (exempted as a critical infrastructure project) continued with social distancing and heightened health and safety standards. Demoff acknowledged that there was a possibility that its completion could be delayed, explaining that it was \\"not the time you want to be finishing a stadium, in this environment as you prepare\\", but that \\"our stadium, and I believe the Raiders' stadium as well, will both be amazing when they are finished and when they will begin play, which will certainly happen in the near future, whether that's in July, August, September, in 2021\\". As of May 11, five construction workers had tested positive, including an ironworker who had worked in an assembly area away from the structure, and a backfill operator who had worked in an \\"isolated area outside the building\\" and had not entered it. On June 5, 2020, construction on the facility was temporarily halted after an ironworker fell to his death through a hole in the roof created by the removal of a panel for maintenance. On June 9, 2020, construction on the facility resumed everywhere but the roof. =Cancelled opening events, first NFL games= All of the originally-announced summer concerts at the venue were cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic, including a two-night stop on Taylor Swift's Lover Fest tour on July 25 and 26, 2020 (originally announced as the stadium's grand opening), and tours by Guns N' Roses (2020 Tour), Kenny Chesney (Chillaxification Tour), Tim McGraw (Here on Earth Tour) and M√∂tley Cr√ºe and Def Leppard (The Stadium Tour). The entirety of the NFL preseason was also cancelled; the Rams held their first practice at the stadium on August 22, 2020. On August 25, 2020, the Chargers and Rams announced that all games at the stadium would be held behind closed doors \\"until further notice\\". An official ribbon-cutting ceremony was hosted on September 8, 2020, ahead of its first NFL event on September 13 ‚Äî featuring the Rams hosting the Dallas Cowboys in the first Sunday-night game of the season. Naming On September 15, 2019, it was announced that personal finance company SoFi had acquired the naming rights to the new stadium under a 20-year deal valued at over $30 million per-year, under which the stadium will be known as SoFi Stadium. The company became an official partner of both the Rams and the Chargers, as well as a partner of the performance venue and surrounding entertainment district. The covered open space formerly known as Champions Plaza between the playing field and the performance venue within the stadium was officially named American Airlines Plaza. The airline was named the first founding partner on August 6, 2019. Funding The stadium was built privately, but the developer is seeking significant tax breaks from Inglewood. The cost of the stadium project was originally estimated to be approximately $2.66 billion upon the commencement of construction. However, internal league documents produced by the NFL in March 2018 indicated a need to raise the debt ceiling for the stadium and facility to a total of $4.963 billion, making it the most expensive sports venue ever built. Team owners voted and approved this new debt ceiling at a meeting that same month. In May 2020, another $500 million in loans was approved by the NFL and the owners. Teams The St. Louis Rams were first to commit to moving to the stadium, as NFL approval for their relocation to Los Angeles was obtained on January 12, 2016. The approval, as part of a concession made by Kroenke to get the stadium project and Rams relocation approved, also gave the San Diego Chargers the first option to relocate to Los Angeles and share the stadium with the Rams, conditioned on a negotiated lease agreement between the two teams. The option would have expired on January 15, 2017, at which time the Oakland Raiders would have acquired the same option. On January 29, 2016, the Rams and Chargers came to an agreement in principle to share the stadium. Both teams would contribute a $200 million stadium loan from the NFL and personal seat license fees to the construction costs and would pay $1 per year in rent to the facility's controlling entity, StadCo LA, LLC. The same day, Chargers chairman and CEO Dean Spanos announced the team would remain in San Diego for the 2016 NFL season, while continuing to work with local government on a new stadium. Measure C (the Chargers stadium proposal) did not receive the requisite number of votes required for passage. On January 12, 2017, the Chargers exercised their option and announced plans to relocate to Los Angeles for the 2017 season, making the Chargers the second tenant at the stadium and returning them to the market where they played their inaugural season in 1960. The Rams and Chargers' move into the stadium marked the return of major professional sports to Inglewood for the first time since the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings left The Forum for Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles in May 1999. Major events =NFL= Super Bowl LVI SoFi Stadium will host Super Bowl LVI in February 2022, marking the first Super Bowl to be played in the Los Angeles area since Super Bowl XXVII in 1993. The stadium was originally awarded Super Bowl LV (2021) at an NFL owners' meeting in May 2016; in May 2017, due to the opening of the stadium being delayed to 2020, the NFL chose to re-award Super Bowl LV to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa (which was the remaining city in a pool of four used to determine the hosts of Super Bowl LIII through LV), and award LVI to Los Angeles instead. Due to the possibilities of issues that need to be addressed in an inaugural season, the NFL does not allow stadiums to host the Super Bowl during their first season of operation. =College football= College Football Playoff National Championship On November 1, 2017, it was announced that the stadium will host the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship.

The Los Angeles City Council approved the bid after private businesses showed support and offered to pay hosting costs. The SoFi Stadium was not selected as a bidding venue in the winning Canada‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìUnited States bid because the organizing committee left unbuilt venues out of its final evaluations. The United Bid committee stated they would re-evaluate the stadium selection process and re- visit SoFi Stadium as their main option stadium in the Los Angeles Metro area in June 2020. The American bid to host the World Cup was awarded by FIFA on June 13, 2018. =2028 Summer Olympics= SoFi Stadium (which, per prior precedent, will be renamed for the duration of the Games due to sponsorship rules) will host all of the opening and closing ceremonies during the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympics (with organizers having proposed a split format for the Olympics that would also incorporate the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum). The stadium will also host archery and football (soccer) matches. = WrestleMania = Professional wrestling promotion WWE originally announced that SoFi Stadium would host WrestleMania 37 on March 28, 2021.

The Los Angeles Times had previously reported in April 2019 that SoFi Stadium was a \\"front-runner\\" to host a future edition of the event. However, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and California state laws on public gatherings, WWE announced that WrestleMania 37 would be moved to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. WWE has not yet announced any plans to bring the event back to SoFi Stadium in the future.

The theatre auditorium will have a capacity of 6,000 seats and open in 2021. =NFL Media Campus= The campus will become the new home of NFL Media, which is currently based in Culver City. Next to the stadium there is a space to house office operations for hundreds of employees that work for NFL RedZone, NFL.com and the NFL app. It will also be the new site for the NFL Network headquarters. In addition to office and studio space, the facility will feature NFL Media's first outdoor studio and space to host studio audiences.

The album is dueted by vocalists Mohsen Keramati and Noushin Tafi, and is composed by Peyman Khazeni. The album was unveiled on January 27, 2015.  Controversy  In February 2015, the album became controversial after Iranian hardliners falsely claimed that it contains solo female vocals (which is forbidden in Iran). The album got Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ali Jannati under pressure from conservatives. Several senior clerics publicly criticized the album, including Hossein Noori Hamedani, Mohammad Alavi Gorgani, Lotfollah Safi Golpaygani and Naser Makarem Shirazi. ‚ÄúI emphatically deny all reports claiming that the Culture Ministry has authorized an album that contains solo performances by a female singer. The complaints from the respected clerics are based on false reports that they have received about the album. Of course, I respect them and understand their concerns, which come from religious motivations‚Äù, The minister said. Due to the criticisms on the album, two female singers scheduled to perform in Fajr International Music Festival, did not participate in their group's event. The ministry stressed that their absence was ‚Äúwith the agreement of the group‚Äù.  Remove from Market and Cover change  On February 26, 2015 the publisher decided to remove the album from the market in order to change the cover, after being warned by Ministry of Culture. The album's original cover, which portrays only female singer Noushin Tafi, may cause the \\"misunderstanding\\" that it's a solo album by her.

History  The edifice has been designed and built by Alfred Schleusener as a house for his own use, which address was then Danzigerstra√üe 137. This type of realization (an architect building his own house) is pretty common in Gda≈Ñska Street , since other builders did the same at this time: * Carl Meyer, at N¬∞60; * Carl Rose, at N¬∞51; * Fritz Weidner, at N¬∞34; * J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki, at N¬∞63. The building has a distinctive urban character and was erected in 1910-1911. It had a residential wing distinct from the business and trade premises. In the same area of Bydgoszcz, Alfred Schleusener has also realized : * Tenement Carl Meinhardt at Gda≈Ñska street 27, in 1909; * Robert Grundtmann Tenement at S≈Çowackiego street 1, in 1906. Architecture The building has been realized in the style of early, classic modernism.

He was a two-time All-American honorable mention, once as a \\"blocking back\\" and once as a guard, who played in Texas' first two bowl games and then played a season for the New York Yankees of the AAFC. Early life Magliolo was born in Galveston in 1922, the son of Italian immigrants. There he played football and tennis at Ball High School. College football Magliolo started school at Texas in 1939 and from 1940 to 1942 he came out for spring football practice, but it wasn't until the fall of 1942, when World War II created a shortage of players, that he tried out for the varsity. That season, despite being an unheralded high school player whose parents didn't want him to play, Magliolo became Coach Dana X. Bible's choice for starting quarterback, or \\"blocking back\\", at the beginning of the season. At the time, Texas was utilizing the single-wing formation in which the quarterback didn't pass or control the ball as much as the quarterback does in modern football, and was often called the \\"blocking back.\\" The work of taking snaps and throwing the ball was primarily handled by the fullback, who in 1942 was Roy McKay. Later in the season, when the Longhorns began playing against pass-oriented offenses in the Southwest Conference, William Harold \\"Spot\\" Collins became the starter because he was seen as the better pass defender and players went both ways at the time. Still, with platoon football, Magliolo saw considerable playing time right through to the 1943 Cotton Bowl. Texas went 9-2 and won the Southwest Conference championship to finish ranked #11 in the country. They played in, and won, the school's first ever bowl game with a 14-7 win over Georgia Tech in the 1943 Cotton Bowl. In 1943, Magliolo was named one of three team captains for the Longhorns, and the starting quarterback. That season, the Longhorns went 7-1-1, posted the school's first ever repeat conference championship, finished ranked #14 and tied Randolph Field in the 1944 Cotton Bowl. That season, he was an all-conference selection as a back and an All-American honorable mention. After leaving school to serve in the Navy for two years, where he was an executive officer on a PT boat in the Philippines during World War II, Magliolo returned to Texas in 1946. He was considered the team's best blocking and defensive back, but four games into the season, he broke his arm in the Oklahoma game and missed the end of the season. Despite the short season for him, he made Wirt Gammon's All- American Blockers team that year. In 1947, the Longhorns switched to the T-formation which did not need a blocking back, and Magliolo was moved to left guard. Despite the change in position, he was 3rd Team All-Southwest Conference and an honorable mention All-American as the Longhorns went 10-1. They finished ranked #5 and beat Alabama in the 1948 Sugar Bowl. During his time on the team, the Longhorns went 34-6-1. In 1988, he was inducted into the University of Texas Hall of Honor. Pro football Magliolo was first drafted by the Chicago Cardinals in the 17th round of the 1944 NFL Draft, but he never signed with them and instead went off to war. He was then drafted by the New York Yankees of the All-America Football Conference in the 15th round of the 1948 AAFC Draft and played one season for them that year. He played defensive back, recording one interception in 13 games. Magliolo spent much of the 1948 season on the sideline due to injuries, and, in July 1949, he informed the team that he was retiring from professional football to pursue a business career near Galveston, Texas. Later life Magliolo earned a chemical engineering degree from Texas in 1948 and a master's degree in 1949. In 1950, he went to work for Monsanto where he spent 27 years as a chemical engineer. In 1980, he purchased the Bay Area Racquet Club near the Johnson Space Center in Clear Lake, Texas and became an advocate for local tennis.

Smith, was a self-taught painter of the American South who lived and worked in Mississippi most of her life. She created bold, colorful, and expressive paintings, usually using house paint on wood or tin. Her work consists of highly stylized figures in strong colors, often with animating dots and dashes, alongside sometimes cryptically abstracted texts laid upon monochrome contrasting background colors. Her work is shown throughout the world and collected by museums, most famously by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as numerous other museums including the High Museum of Art in Atlanta; the de Young Museum of Art in San Francisco; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; the Milwaukee Art Museum; the Birmingham Museum of Art; and the Smithsonian American Art Museum; as well as the collections of Tufts University, Willamette University, and the University of Mississippi. She has received solo shows at galleries in the United States and Europe, and has been included in numerous group shows. She is considered a Southern self-taught artist, a group that includes Thornton Dial and Nellie Mae Rowe. Her work was heavily promoted by the curator and collector William Arnett. Life Smith was the daughter of sharecroppers. Smith was the third of thirteen children and at an early age had a serious hearing impairment. She completed a fifth-grade education, despite the isolation and loneliness her handicap caused her. Throughout her childhood, Smith \\"found an outlet in drawing.\\" Smith married twice, once in a short marriage to Gus Williams in 1922 and then to John Smith sometime in the 1930s. Her second marriage was also short, ending when Smith saw that her tenant- farmer husband's year-end settlement was grossly short. Her complaints about the mistake, a more than $1,000 difference, led to John Smith \\"sending her away.\\" Smith then moved to Hazelhurst, Mississippi, to live on her own. In 1941, she gave birth to her son, Sheridan L. Major, though she did not marry his father. Smith worked as a gardener and did other domestic work until she retired in the 1970s. In 1985, Smith suffered a stroke that left her speech and writing impaired. She was slowed down to producing only two pieces of work a day after her stroke. As her work output slowed, Smith made less money, and she stopped painting in 1991. She died in 1995. Work Smith began painting in the late 1970s. She transformed her home and garden, an area of approximately one acre, into an immersive outdoor environment‚Äîa \\"highly public form of spiritual autobiography.\\" Her highly expressive and personal work embodied the ideas that had been in her head for years. Once Smith's connected with art collectors, she struggled to keep up with the demand. Smith's work was often created on readily available materials, such as plywood, corrugated tin and other recycled parts. In her earlier work, she often used only one or two colors of paint. Her stylized imagery \\"recalls West African ceremonial masks\\" and many are allegorical. Her art has been likened to artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat. Her work was also very personal in nature. One of her favorite themes was to paint portraits of family, friends and neighbors. Many of her works feature figures with their arms upraised, an image associated with ecstasy or spiritual enlightenment. Smith's later work consisted of geometric compositions with more colors and interesting juxtapositions of positive and negative space. Her work sometimes incorporated text along with her imagery. These textual parts of her work were cryptic and created a \\"personal painting vocabulary\\" which \\"documented and celebrated her world, both religious and secular.\\" Quotes and criticism \\"In the South there were many women who labored as farm hands. Meeting Ms. Smith, witnessing her handiwork and sensitivity and her praising the Lord in her everyday actions, touched me. I could feel all that power she put into her work. She had a hard life... She painted so boldly and on any material she had. She surrounded herself and her yard with her work. She couldn't hear very well, but she could say whatever she needed to say with a paintbrush and she had a smile that would melt your heart.\\" - artist and musician Lonnie Holley \\"... As with all advanced improvisation, Smith's was never an unmodulated, let-it-all-hang-out, instinctual process, but rather a mixing of careful planning with retrospective and prospective painterly performance‚Äìan act of looking back (in time or space) and looking forward at the painting. One untitled work contains sequential applications of black paint, then orange, then more black, and then red paint. Their effect restrains the orange, the piece's most aggressive color. A resulting tension between the black and the hot colors is tightened by the use of black both to underpaint and to partially efface the orange figures. Notice as well that all five faces‚Äô features are created with different combinations of colors. Written inscriptions, vigorous brushwork, and virtuoso color were not her only expressive tools; she also could dress her message. An interesting relationship existed between Smith's wardrobe and her art. In her closet, Smith kept an extensive dress collection defined, as was her yard, by juxtapositions of the spiritual and the mundane. These dresses reflected her every mood and thought. They hung in her closet, compartmentalized, sacred and profane; quiet, solemn spirituals sung by Marian Anderson; boisterous celebrations of life by Louis Armstrong, Little Richard, B.B. King. When she felt pious or humble, when she would draw a picture of a simple little house with a tiny lone occupant and accompany it with a statement of ultimate humility‚Äî\\"My name is someone. The Lord for me he no‚Äù‚Äîor when she would paint Christ surrounded by spots of blood, she would dress in white‚Äìthe traditional domestic servant's outfit (it was called a ‚Äúuniform‚Äù) or a nurse's attire‚Äîto serve God or to try to heal us all. When she painted a portrait of a friend with orange and green house paint, or other lively multicolor tributes to her dogs and cats, or when she felt like chastising us for our shortcomings (‚ÄúOn face is all righ to face wont do‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Lord know ho is good and ho is baid and ho tells lies‚Äù), she came out in explosions of color, flashing, zigzagging, speaking her piece, standing her ground. She stood her ground until 1995, when she died at the age of ninety-one. A poor, black, uneducated, hearing-impaired daughter of a sharecropper had become a major artist exhibited and collected throughout the United States...\\" - William Arnett, founder of the Souls Grown Deep foundation.

The mobile-health patient engagement app was designed to help patients and healthcare providers share information, schedule online doctor visits, talk to a doctor online and manage patient data from a smartphone or tablet. History Pager was founded by a group of entrepreneurs who had previously worked in the world of technology startups. Formerly known as techCare, Inc., the company changed its name to Pager in 2014. Pager is headquartered in New York City. To help patients navigate the non-emergency healthcare experience using a mobile device, Pager co-founders Gaspard de Dreuzy, Philip Eytan, and Oscar Salazar (former Uber CTO), designed and developed the Pager app. The company officially launched Pager on May 1, 2014. Pager‚Äôs online medical care management services are currently available in Florida, New York, Texas and New Jersey. In 2015, Pager‚Äôs virtual doctor services and medical information management app switched from being primarily out-of-pocket for customers, to a supported network model that worked with insurance plans. Since then, the company has worked with different insurers to complete the reimbursement process for its services, including online doctor visits and virtual nurse chats. Pager expanded its offerings in 2016 to include virtual nurse chat services between patients and nursing staff to help determine the recommended course of care. That same year, the company left its San Francisco offices to grow the Pager user base in the New York City market. In January 2017, Gaspard de Dreuzy stepped down from his role as CEO. Pager‚Äôs executive board chairman, Walter Jin, moved into the position. Next, de Dreuzy shifted into the role of President, while co-founder Philip Eytan took on the role of Chief Strategy Officer. It was announced in February 2017 that Pager would incorporate development company PokitDok‚Äôs healthcare price comparison tool into the healthcare navigation platform. The addition of this tool enabled the Pager app to accept insurance for a more diverse group of patients across different locations. Pager entered into a new engagement with Horizon Healthcare Services in September 2017. The company began delivering the Pager app to Horizon customers in January 2018. Pager has been featured in several publications, including the Wall Street Journal, Inc Magazine and the Huffington Post. It has also been featured in news segments on WNBC, Wall Street Journal Live, and WABC. Products and Services The Pager app gives users access to a variety of urgent care services. Patients can find a local doctor in their area, schedule in-home visits by board-certified physicians, and schedule virtual telemedicine sessions with the app. Physicians use Pager to share electronic health records across their network, manage appointments and monitor patient care.  Company News  In 2017, Pager Chairman and CEO Walter Jin was named one of 50+ innovation leaders by MedCity News and AARP. The list was tallied from more than 5000 MedCityNews readers to showcase individuals who are modernizing patient care in order to meet the needs of a mobile world.

Vaiana Astronomical Observatory is an astronomical observatory located in Palermo, Sicily, Italy, housed inside the Palazzo dei Normanni. It is one of the research facilities of the National Institute of Astrophysics. The observatory carries out research projects in the field of astronomy and astrophysics including the study of solar and stellar coronas, stellar evolution (including the birth of stars) and of the supernova remnants. History The 5-foot diameter Palermo circle manufactured by Jesse Ramsden to measure apparent positions of astronomical objects. It was founded in 1790 by Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, at the suggestion of some intellectuals of the time, including the then Sicilian viceroy Francesco d'Aquino, Prince of Caramanico to endow the Sicilian city with an element of prestige as an astronomical observatory. It was hard to find an expert astronomer who would agree to work in such a peripheral location at the time. In the end the choice fell on Giuseppe Piazzi, a middle-aged mathematician, who before had not particularly distinguished himself in astronomy. The new director immediately dealt with the purchase of the most modern astronomical instruments of the time to make the observatory compete at European level: among other things, a surveying instrument of five-foot diameter to work in conjunction with telescopes to document the position of stars was purchased, made by English manufacturer Jesse Ramsden, and the first dome was built. It was Piazzi's determination that allowed the precious English instrument to arrive in Sicily: the astronomer had to go personally to prod the builder and, later, also cope with all the bureaucratic difficulties that arose: the British government was reluctant to allow the export of a uniquely capable instrument (a status which remained for many years, a fundamental aspect of the observatory's early value). Thanks to the new equipment, and in particular to the Palermo Circle, as it became known in English-speaking world (or the Circle of Ramsden in Italian), this was Ramsden's most celebrated achievement.Ceres: Keeping Well- Guarded Secrets for 215 Years http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news- detail.html?id=4824 In 1801 Piazzi discovered and identified the first asteroid Ceres. He named this object which became classified in the 21st century a dwarf planet, Cerere Ferdinandea, in honour of the myth of Ceres set in Sicily and of King Ferdinand; thanks to this discovery, he was awarded a gold medal which he refused instead donating its worth to the purchase of other instruments, including a Troughton equatorial telescope that he placed in the second dome of the observatory. In 1817 Piazzi moved to Naples to complete the setting up of the Capodimonte Astronomical Observatory, leaving direction of the Palermo observatory to his assistant Niccol√≤ Cacciatore. Cacciatore was succeeded, in 1841, by his son Gaetano; however, in 1848, he was removed for political reasons, having taken part in the revolutionary anti-Bourbon movements. The management of the Palermo observatory was then entrusted to Domenico Ragona, who succeeded in obtaining from the Two Sicilies government the necessary funds to purchase new instruments, including a 25 cm aperture Merz equatorial telescope, delivered in 1859. With the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860, the situation was reversed: Gaetano Cacciatore's directorship was reinstated and Ragona removed, without being able to install the Merz telescope. Pietro Tacchini, appointed Deputy Astronomer in 1863, installed and commissioned the equatorial telescope in 1865, using it for solar physics research which would make the Palermo Observatory famous in the second half of the nineteenth century and lead to the foundation of the Society of Italian Spectroscopists (1871), whose Memoirs (Memorie) - the first review of astrophysics - would be published periodically in Palermo from 1872 by Tacchini. The departure of Tacchini for Rome in 1879 began a difficult phase; Annibale Ricc√≤, the Deputy (i.e. \\"Adjunct\\") Astronomer, managed to keep the quality of research high until he took over the direction of the Catania observatory in 1890; then, the political and military events ‚Äì and the consequent financial difficulties of the Government ‚Äì severely compromised the observatory, which in 1923 was downgraded to the university's Cabinet of Astronomy. From 1931 to 1936 its director was Corradino Mineo, an academician of the Lincei, who had a second term from 1938 to 1948, after the directorship of Francesco Zagar. They were years characterized by great difficulties of the institution, which had already seen, in the reform of 1923, declassification to a simple astronomical cabinet, and it was hit by a serious decline, with a reduction of personnel and scarcity of funds for the conduct of observations and for technological adaptation. The problems became acute during and after the Second World War, when the observatory was close to closure, deprived of some premises, after having also been deprived, in 1939, of the only modern observation instrument it was equipped with, a model of zenith telescope developed by Julius Wanschaff in Berlin. The three domes originally placed on the roof of the building were replaced in the fifties with others in iron, which were later removed because they were too heavy and dangerous for the structure; later, lighter copper domes of the previous design were installed. It is named after Giuseppe Salvatore Vaiana, who directed it from 1976 to 1991.

Museum The Museum of the Specola, located at the top of the leaning tower of the Norman palace, is mainly composed of 18th- and 19th-century instruments, among which are achromatic telescopes, a sextant, some barometers and thermometers, as well as two main items earlier mentioned: the Palermo Circle (circle by Ramsden) and Edward Troughton's equatorial telescope. It hosts other contemporary instruments and a series of oil paintings that portray personalities from the scientific world.

His younger sister was the actress Elsa Lanchester.Henryk Jurkowski, Thi√©ri Foulc, Encyclop√©die mondiale des arts de la marionnett, Entretemps, 2009, p.422. Two of the earliest puppets he created were named \\"Baldo and Belsa\\", the pet names of himself and his sister Elsa. The family were considered Bohemian, and refused to legalise their union in any conventional way to satisfy the era's conservative society. Puppetry career Lanchester and his wife Muriel became interested in the puppetry revival of the early 20th century pioneered by H.W. Whanslaw, whose book Everybody's Theatre was published in 1923. He joined Whanslaw, to found the British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild. They founded the Whanslaw-Lanchester Marionettes a year later, based at the London Marionette Theatre in Stamford Brook. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum, \\"together they evolved aspects of marionettes such as the vertical control and new types of joints and methods of balancing. The London Marionette Theatre was the first to broadcast puppets on television, making nine broadcasts from the Baird Studios in 1933\\". Waldo Lanchester branched off from Whanslaw to perform at the Malvern Festival of 1935 in a tent pitched in the garden of Foley House, Home of his future wife Muriel who was a potter and exhibited there, They were married and opened the Lanchester Marionette Theatre at Foley House, in Malvern, in 1936. In 1937 he wrote Hand Puppets and String Puppets in which he argued for the teaching of puppetry to children as it \\"develops the power of initiative, teaches skillful use of tools, paint brush, and needle, makes practical use of historical research for costume design and architecture. Stage fright is banished, the children being only too eager to take part behind the scenes.\\"Lanchester, Waldo, Hand Puppets and String Puppets, Dryad Press, Introduction.

In tandem with his puppet theatre, he ran a toy shop in Henley Street, Stratford-upon-Avon. Shakes versus Shav Bernard Shaw had shown an interest in marionettes throughout his life. Lanchester showed Shaw two puppets portraying Shakespeare and Shaw, asking Shaw to write a short drama for them. Having seen the performances of the Lanchester marionettes over the years, Shaw agreed to write Shakes versus Shav for the company in 1949. Lanchester carved the six marionettes (heads were carved by Jack Whitehead) and Muriel costumed them, having sought advice from Scotland on the correct tartans for the puppets representing Rob Roy and Macbeth.

She managed the important inn at Ljungby in Sunnerbo. She was also a successful farmer, who acquired many of the farms around the area of the inn. In 1828, when it was decided that a city should be founded in Sunnerbo, Ljungby (at that time only a couple of farms around the inn), was chosen to be founded upon the land donated by her in her will. In 1981 a memorial stone was erected near her inn.One of Ljungby's major arterial roads is named after M√§rta Ljungberg. G√§stgivareg√•rden in Ljungby that was built after M√§rta Ljungberg's inn burned down in 1754. Before the inn M√§rta Ljungberg grew up on Ljungby G√•rd (English: Ljungby Farm) together with her parents and six siblings. She was daughter to fr√§lseinspektor and innkeeper Lars Svensson Frimolin and his wife Margareta Larsdotter. Inn After her parents' death the ownership of inn was taken over by her brother Abraham Ljungberg (later Ljungfelt) with the everyday operation handed over to M√§rta herself. Instead her brother made a career as a county official (Swe: landskamrerare) for the county. During the next four years the thingstead in Hamneda and the marketplace in Berga was moved to Ljungby. In 1681 she married with the district bailiff Lars T√•ckenbo. Four years later, 1685, Lars was transferred to Stockholm around the same time as the birth of their first child, the son Samuel. Eight years later Lars was transferred to Halmstad. They had a second son, but he only lived for eight days. It took several years, into the 1700s, before Lars was transferred to Ljungby under G√∂ta Court of Appeal. Meanwhile, her son Samuel studied in Lund and became captain lieutenant. However, he was hit by the Asian plague and died in 1710 at age 25. Four years later her husband, Lars, died at Angelstad rectory. After her brother's death in 1724, she was required to pay a retroactively annual lease of the inn to her nephews. After her refusal to pay the inn was ceded to them in 1729, when M√§rta was 73 years of age. Testament In the autumn of 1741 M√§rtha Ljungberg damaged her hip when she fell off a wagon. She later died on October 4, 1741, 85 years old. After three months lying in state she was buried by dean Olof Osander. During her life she managed to acquire an estate of twelve farms; including Eskilsg√•rden, S√∂derg√•rden, and Klockareg√•rden that today is located in and around Ljungby's Old Marketplace. Before her death, she decided that the proceeds of her estate should go to scholarships for students of Sm√•lands Nation in Lund and the poor in Ljungby, K√•nna och Angelstad's parishes. Her nephews were disinherited. In 1754 the inn burned to the ground, but is later rebuilt between 1818 and 1820 in its current form.  Legacy  During the 1828 discussions about the founding of a new town in Sunnerbo, Ljungby was elected thanks to her donation. The town of Ljungby would then later be founded on the land donated by M√§rta Ljungberg. In 1981 a memorial stone was erected in her memory at the old market place where her inn was located. The street M√§rta Ljungbergsv√§gen (Eng: M√§rta Ljungberg's Street) was named after her. It is one of the most trafficked streets in Ljungby and part of the old trade route that brought most of her customers.

The victim crawled to a road where she was found, and recovered after six days in the hospital. The perpetrators were found not guilty by mental disease or defect and committed to mental health institutions for sentences of 25 and 40 years. Background Artistic depiction of the fictional Slender Man Slender Man is a fictional entity created on the Something Awful online forums for a 2009 Photoshop paranormal image contest. The Slender Man mythos was later expanded by a number of other people who created fan fiction and additional artistic depictions of the entity. Slender Man is a tall, thin character, with a featureless white face and head. He is depicted as wearing a black suit, and is sometimes shown with tentacles growing out of his back. According to the Slender Man mythos, the entity can cause amnesia, bouts of coughing and paranoid behavior in individuals. He is often depicted hiding in forests or stalking children. The victim, Payton Leutner, and the perpetrators, Anissa Weier and Morgan Geyser, were all 12 years old at the time of the stabbing, and were classmates enrolled in the same school. The school's principal later confirmed that neither Weier nor Geyser had any prior disciplinary issues. They had been at a sleepover together the night before the stabbing. The attackers had discovered Slender Man on the Creepypasta Wiki. They later said they had believed Slender Man to be real, and had wanted to demonstrate their loyalty to him so they could become his \\"proxies\\", live in his mansion, prove his existence, and prevent him from harming their families. They believed that the only way to do this would be to kill someone, after which they would become servants of the Slender Man and live in his mansion, which they thought was located in Chequamegon‚ÄìNicolet National Forest. Geyser explained during police interviews that she had seen and heard hallucinations of ghosts since the age of three, and was certain that \\"Slender\\" had demanded she kill her best friend to save the lives of her own family. Attack Weier and Geyser initially planned to attack Leutner on May 30, 2014. They planned to tape the victim's mouth shut, stab her in the neck, and flee. They did not carry out that attack; Weier and Geyser were believed to be \\"too tired\\" or \\"too groggy.\\" Geyser was reported to have said \\"let her have another morning\\". A second plan called for attacking Leutner in a bathroom at a local park, choosing the location for the fact that the bathroom had drains for Leutner's blood. The actual attack took place in a nearby forest (David's Park) during a game of hide-and-seek on May 31, 2014. Leutner was pinned down and stabbed 19 times in the arms, legs, and torso with a kitchen knife with a five-inch-long (13 cm) blade. Two wounds were to major organs, one missed a major artery of her heart by less than a millimeter, and another went through her diaphragm, cutting into her liver and stomach. Weier told the victim to lay down because the blood will come out slower. Weier and Geyser then told Leutner they would get help for her, but instead simply left. Leutner dragged herself to a nearby road where she was found by a cyclist. Weier and Geyser were apprehended near Interstate 94 at Steinhafel's furniture store. The knife used in the stabbing was in a bag they carried. While Geyser felt no empathy, Weier was described as feeling guilty for stabbing the victim, but felt that the attack was needed to appease Slender Man. Leutner left the hospital seven days after the attack. She returned to school in September 2014. Sentencing In 2017, Weier pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide. A jury then found her \\"not guilty by mental disease or defect.\\" Geyser accepted a plea offer under which she would not go to trial and would be evaluated by psychiatrists to determine how long she should be placed in a mental hospital. She later pleaded guilty but was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia, from which her father also suffers. Weier was sentenced to 25 years to life, an indeterminate sentence involving at least three years locked confinement and involuntary treatment in a state psychiatric institute, followed by communal supervision until age 37. Geyser was sentenced to the maximum, 40 years to life, an indeterminate sentence involving at least three years locked confinement, in addition to involuntary treatment in a state psychiatric institute until complete resolution of symptoms or until age 53, whichever may happen first; followed by continued communal supervision, periodic reevaluations and/or reinstitution and further treatment, as needed, as required by the sentence imposed. In 2018, a Wisconsin judge sentenced Geyser to 40 years under mental health facility's supervision. While Geyser will periodically have the opportunity to petition for her release from a mental health facility in the future, she will remain under institutional care for the duration of the sentence. During her trial, Geyser had been committed to the Winnebago Mental Health Institute and was the youngest patient there. In 2020, an appeals court rejected Geyser's petition to be retried as a juvenile. Her attorney, Matthew Pinix, argued that she should have been charged with attempted second-degree intentional homicide rather than first-degree, and argued that Geyser gave statements to investigators before being read her Miranda rights. He has petitioned the state Supreme Court to review the ruling. Reactions In the aftermath of the stabbing, the Creepypasta Wiki was blocked throughout the Waukesha School District. On the Tuesday following the stabbing, Slender Man creator Eric Knudsen said: \\"I am deeply saddened by the tragedy in Wisconsin and my heart goes out to the families of those affected by this terrible act.\\" Sloshedtrain, the administrator of the Creepypasta Wiki, said that the stabbing was an isolated incident that did not accurately represent the creepypasta community. He also stated that the Creepypasta Wiki was a literary website and that they did not condone murder or satanic rituals. Members of the creepypasta community held a 24-hour live stream on YouTube June 13‚Äì14, 2014, to raise money for the stabbing victim. Joe Jozwowski, an administrator on a creepypasta website, said the purpose of the stream was to show that members of the community cared for the victim and did not condone real-world violence because they enjoyed fiction that contains violence. On August 12, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker issued a proclamation declaring Wednesday, August 13, 2014, \\"Purple Hearts for Healing Day\\" and encouraged the people of Wisconsin to wear purple on that day to honor the victim of the stabbing. He also praised the \\"strength and determination\\" exhibited by the victim during her recovery. The city of Madison, Wisconsin, held a one-day bratwurst festival to honor the victim on August 29, several days before the victim returned to school. Hot dogs and bratwurst were sold to raise money towards the victim's medical costs. The event was run by over 250 volunteers, and raised over $70,000 for Payton Leutner. =Debate on the impact of the Internet on children= The stabbing resulted in extensive debate about the role of the Internet in society and its impact on children. Russell Jack, Waukesha Police Chief, said that the stabbing \\"should be a wake-up call for all parents,\\" adding that the Internet \\"is full of information and wonderful sites that teach and entertain,\\" but that it \\"can also be full of dark and wicked things.\\" John Egelhof, a retired agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, argued that the Internet had become a \\"blackhole\\" with the ability to expose children to a more sinister world. He suggested that the best way to avoid future incidents was for parents to keep track of their children's web habits and to educate them on the differences between right and wrong. Shira Chess, an assistant professor of mass media arts at the University of Georgia, stated that creepypasta was no more dangerous than stories about vampires or zombies. She argued that creepypasta websites were beneficial, and that they gave people the opportunity to become better writers. =Media= A documentary film on the incident called Beware the Slenderman was released by HBO Films in March 2016, and was broadcast on HBO on January 23, 2017. A season 16 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, titled \\"Glasgowman's Wrath,\\" is loosely based on the event. The Criminal Minds episode \\"The Tall Man\\" (Episode 14.05, airdate October 31, 2018) was also inspired by this story. On October 14, 2018, a movie inspired by the Slender Man stabbing called Terror in the Woods aired on Lifetime. The film stars Ella West Jerrier, Sophia Grace McCarthy, Skylar Morgan Jones, Angela Kinsey, Drew Powell, and Carrie Hood. Christina Ricci serves as the executive producer of the film. On March 31, 2019, another movie inspired by the Slender Man stabbing titled Mercy Black, starring Daniela Pineda, was released to Netflix with no prior announcement. Directed by Owen Egerton and produced primarily by Blumhouse Productions, it tells the story of two girls with pre-schizophrenia who attempt to murder their friend, believing that a spirit named Mercy Black will offer them a gift in return. Later, the protagonist is released from psychiatric care, and has to deal with the realistic and paranormal consequences of her actions. On October 24, 2019, more than five years after the stabbing, Leutner, then 17, spoke to ABC's 20/20 about her experience for the first time. She spoke of her scars, saying, \\"I don't think much of them. They will probably go away and fade eventually.\\" She told the interviewers that she met her attackers in fourth grade. When asked what she would say if she ever saw Geyser again, Leutner added that she would \\"thank\\" her because the attack inspired her to pursue a career in medicine.

Products  Avalon International Breads produces a wide variety of baked goods, including breads, rolls, pizzas, cookies, and pastries, as well as sandwiches and coffee. In 2014, it became the first establishment in Metro Detroit to serve toast bar-style artisan toast. The bakery also sells a wide variety of foods and beverages made by other Michigan-based companies, including products from Ann Arbor's Garden Works, Lansing's Apple Schram, and Trenton's Chartreuse Organic Herbal Tea.  History  Avalon International Breads was established in 1997 in Detroit's Midtown/Cass Corridor neighborhood, the creation of life partners Ann Perrault and Jackie Victor. Before opening the bakery, Perrault and Victor worked at Stonehouse Breads in Leland, Michigan, where they both baked and developed their future business plan. Although neither were originally from Detroit, both founders have long been residents of the city; Perrault, who is originally from Downriver, has lived in Detroit since 1980, while Victor, who hails from Metro Detroit's northern suburbs, has been a city resident since 1990. Upon opening Avalon International Breads in June 1997, Perrault and Victor had $150,000 for covering their startup costs, which they had gained through donations, two loans from Ann Arbor‚Äôs Zen Temple, and from selling $20,000 in bread coupons. The bakery's founders based their business model on the Buddhist concept of \\"right livelihood\\", which they learned from the Zen priest and corporate management consultant Geri Larkin. They also received assistance from the Ann Arbor-based bakery Zingerman's, including a substantial discount on the purchase of its old steam-powered oven as well as its original business plan. In 2008, Avalon International Breads was serving about 500 customers daily, which by 2015 had expanded to over 1,000 customers each day. As of 2015, the bakery also serves over 40 wholesale clients; they include grocery stores, such as Holiday Market, Plum Market, and Whole Foods Market, and restaurants throughout Southeast Michigan, including Small Plates in Detroit, the Jolly Pumpkin in Ann Arbor, Frittata in Clawson, and Bastone in Royal Oak. In January 2013, Avalon International Breads was purchasing over of milled organic bread flour from farmers in Kansas every week, making it the largest purchaser of organic flour in Michigan.  Operations  = Business model = Avalon International Breads adheres to a triple bottom line philosophy, which it interprets as consisting of \\"Earth\\", \\"Community\\", and \\"Employees\\". Firstly, it uses organic and local ingredients wherever possible while also practicing other environmentally friendly policies \\"at every opportunity\\", as in the case of recycling. Secondly, the bakery supports \\"organizations and projects that create a healthier, more vibrant Detroit\\", from giving its leftovers to food banks to its founders' campaign to shut down the city's municipal trash incinerator. Finally, the bakery pays its employees living wages while also providing them with benefits, including health care, 50% for massage therapy, and \\"liberal\\" vacation time. The bakery also practices open-book management, which allows its employees to access its financial information. = Employees = In 2008, Avalon International Breads employed 35 people; by 2012, it employed 55, including six at its Eat Well, Do Good Cafe at Henry Ford Hospital. The bakery expected to add approximately 100 additional employees in 2013 to help it accommodate growth resulting from the opening of Avalon City Ovens, its new production facility, and a prospective move to a larger Midtown/Cass Corridor location on W. Canfield. However, by February 2015, a move to W. Canfield had not occurred, and the bakery counted a total of 56 employees. Partially due to recruiting at Detroit schools and informing neighborhood residents of available employment opportunities, 90% of the bakery's employees are residents of the city; however, Avalon City Ovens manager Kyresha LeFever notes that hiring has not always been easy, and the bakery has had \\"a hard time finding inner-city people that just have...a baking background or a pastry background\\". LeFever also adds that the bakery is a very LGBT friendly employer, and that \\"it's a breath of fresh air to work for someone that plays such a major role in the LGBT community\\". = Locations = The original Avalon International Breads location at 422 W. Willis in January 2015 The original Avalon International Breads bakery is located at 422 W. Willis in the Midtown/Cass Corridor neighborhood of Detroit. Here, the bakery uses a traditional, Old World baking technique that involves hand- stirring its bread starter in a , Italian-style dough mixer and baking it in a , steam-injected oven. The bakery has two additional locations in Detroit: the Eat Well, Do Good Cafe at Henry Ford Hospital at 2799 W. Grand Boulevard in New Center, and Avalon City Ovens, a production facility in a former industrial warehouse at 4731 Bellevue on the city's East Side, near the Packard Automotive Plant. Established in 2013, Avalon City Ovens features a large Italian artisan deck oven and accounts for the majority of the bakery's output, primarily serving its retail and wholesale customers. = Finances and growth = In 2006, Avalon International Breads recorded a net income of $60,000, which tripled to $180,000 in 2007. In 2009, it generated $1.8 million in revenue, and by 2011 its revenue had increased to $2.2 million. This growth was largely driven by the expansion of the bakery's line of sweets, which grew in value from $400,000 to $975,000 over the previous 18 months, and total sales at the Eat Well, Do Good Cafe, which beat expectations and totaled over $725,000 by 2012. Since 2012, the bakery has been exploring the possibility of moving from its original location on W. Willis to a newer and larger building on nearby W. Canfield, next to the Traffic Jam & Snug restaurant; however, as of February 2015 the bakery is still located in its original building on Willis.

The commentator for the event was Joey Styles. The name of the event referred to both the gangsta rap song Gangsta's Paradise by Coolio, which had been released the prior month, and The Gangstas, a tag team who were scheduled to compete in the main event. The song Gangsta's Paradise was used in the TV commercial spot for the video on ECW Hardcore TV. Gangstas Paradise saw the ECW debut of \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin, Psicosis and Rey Misterio, Jr., all of whom would go on to greater prominence in the late 1990s in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The event was released on VHS later the same year and on DVD in 2002. The bout between Psicosis and Rey Misterio, Jr. was also featured on the 2000 compilation DVD Path of Destruction, while the tag team bout between The Pitbulls and Raven and Stevie Richards was featured on both the 2001 DVD release ECW: Hardcore History and the 2004 DVD release The Rise and Fall of ECW. Although not airing on pay-per-view, in July 2019 the event was added to the WWE Network, in the ECW pay-per-view section. Background Gangstas Paradise featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Gangstas Paradise took place shortly after three of ECW's most prominent performers - Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko and Eddie Guerrero - had resigned from ECW to join World Championship Wrestling, leading to concerns that the promotion was \\"on the ropes\\". ECW booker Paul Heyman attempted to compensate for the loss of Benoit, Guerrero and Malenko by signing Psicosis and Rey Misterio, Jr., two prominent luchadores recommended to him by Konnan. Heyman also hired \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin, who had been released from World Championship Wrestling while rehabilitating an injury. The event saw the continuation of a number of feuds, including The Gangstas versus The Public Enemy; Raven's Nest versus Tommy Dreamer, The Pitbulls and Francine; Mikey Whipwreck versus The Sandman; and 2 Cold Scorpio versus Taz. Event =Preliminary matches= Jason scored an upset victory over Taz at Gangstas Paradise. The opening match pitted Bull Pain against The Broad Street Bully. Following a brawl that saw the men fight at ringside and use weapons, Bull Pain won by pinning The Broad Street Bully after an elevated DDT. The second match was a tag team bout between The Dudley Brothers and Chad Austin and Don E. Allen. The Dudley Brothers won a brief squash match when Dudley Dudley pinned Allen following a splash. The third match saw Hack Myers face J.T. Smith. The bout ended when Smith (whose gimmick saw him continually botch moves) fell through a table at ringside while attempting a moonsault and was subsequently counted out. The fourth match was a six-man tag team match, with The Eliminators and their manager, Jason, facing The Steiner Brothers and Taz. Jason won the match for his team by scoring an upset pinfall on Taz following interference from 2 Cold Scorpio, who kicked Taz in his injured neck. =Main event matches= \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin made his ECW debut at Gangstas Paradise. The fifth bout of the evening was a tag team dog collar match for the ECW World Tag Team Championship between defending champions Raven and Stevie Richards and challengers The Pitbulls, with the stipulation that The Pitbulls would be forced to disband if they lost. The match began with Raven coming to the ring alone, after which his valet, Beulah McGillicutty, claimed that Stevie Richards was unable to compete due to a broken arm sustained the prior night and requested that the match be changed to two out of three falls. Pitbull #1 returned backstage and emerged dragging Richards with him, revealing that his arm was not broken. Meanwhile, Raven scored a pinfall on Pitbull #2 after piledriving him through a table. Several minutes later, Pitbull #2 evened the count by pinning Richards after The Pitbulls superbombed him through a table. The Dudley Brothers then interfered in the match, helping Raven and Richards superbomb both of The Pitbulls. The Pitbulls no-sold the superbombs, immediately rallying and superbombing the Dudley Brothers, removing them from play. Shortly afterwards, Raven drugged Pitbull #2 by holding an ether-soaked rag over his face, then drove him through a table at ringside with a diving elbow drop, causing him to be helped backstage and leaving Pitbull #1 two-on-one. New Jack, one-half of The Gangstas. Tommy Dreamer, Raven's nemesis, then ran to the ring and took Pitbull #2's place, quickly DDT'ing Raven and pinning him, apparently winning the titles. As Dreamer and Pitbull #1 celebrated, troubleshooting referee Bill Alfonso, who in the weeks prior to the event had repeatedly aided Raven by stridently enforcing minor rule infractions by Dreamer - came to the ring - accompanied by Big Dick Dudley - and overturned the decision, striking Dreamer's victory over Raven from the record and awarding the match to Raven and Richards. This led ECW commissioner Tod Gordon to enter the ring and argue with Alfonso, who attacked Gordon, resulting in Dreamer coming to his defense. Big Dick Dudley then gave Dreamer a chokeslam, a move that had previously been banned by Alfonso. After Alfonso announced that he was lifting the ban on the chokeslam for one night only, 911 - a wrestler whose signature maneuver was the chokeslam - entered the ring and chokeslammed Alfonso. Pitbull #2 then returned to the ring, with The Pitbulls executing a superbomb on both Raven and Richards simultaneously with the assistance of Dreamer and 911 then pinning both men to win the third fall and the match, becoming the new ECW World Tag Team Champions. The sixth match was a singles bout between two luchadores, Psicosis and Rey Misterio, Jr., both of whom were making their ECW debuts. In a fast-paced match, Mysterio pinned Psicosis following a huracanrana. Writing in 2019, Mitch Passero of WWE stated that the match \\"had the ECW faithful on their feet and helped both young Superstars quickly make a name for themselves.\\" Before the main event, a vignette aired in which the debuting \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin mockingly impersonated Hulk Hogan. The main event was the titular \\"Gangstas Paradise\\" match, a six-man tag team match held inside a weapon-filled cage. The original line up for the match was The Gangstas (Mustafa Saed and New Jack) and ECW World Heavyweight Champion The Sandman against Mikey Whipwreck and The Public Enemy. After Saed missed the event, he was replaced with ECW World Television Champion 2 Cold Scorpio. The match ended when Whipwreck pinned The Sandman after executing a splash from the top of the cage. Following the match, The Sandman attacked Whipwreck, resulting in the six men brawling as the event came to a close. Aftermath The feud between Whipwreck and The Sandman continued, with Whipwreck defeating The Sandman for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship on October 28, 1995. The events of Gangstas Paradise led to a number of matches taking place at November to Remember on November 18, 1995. These included a Mexican Deathmatch between Misterio and Psicosis, a singles match between Gordon and Alfonso, and a tag team match pitting Raven and Cactus Jack against Dreamer and Terry Funk. \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin briefly competed for ECW, including unsuccessfully challenging Whipwreck for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at November to Remember, before signing with the World Wrestling Federation later that year. Reception The reaction to the event was highly positive, with the ECW World Tag Team Championship title match singled out for praise. Pat McNeill of the Pro Wrestling Torch described the match as \\"state of the art hardcore wrestling, pacing and booking\\", while Derek Burgan, also of the Pro Wrestling Torch, described it as \\"an absolutely insane brawl with a 10 star finish\\".

She was one of the greatest and most powerful of the private creditors of Charles XII of Sweden during the Great Northern War, and her claim on the Swedish state dragged on for years after the end of the war. In Sweden, she became known simply as \\"The Polish Countess\\". Life Anna Woynarowska was the daughter of the Cossack colonel Ivan Mirovich (d. 1706) and a member of the Polish von Mirowicz family of the Ukraine. She married Andrei Stanislaus Woynarowski (1680-1740), a nephew of Ivan Mazepa and a colonel of the Ukrainian Cossacks, with whom she had the daughter Carolina Eleonora and the son Stanislaus. The Cossacks of Mazepa was allied to Charles XII of Sweden against Russia, and Mazepa had, further more, given Charles XII a considerable loan, likely from the Cossack war fund. When Ivan Mazepa died in 1709, the debt note of a half a million riksdaler which Charles XII owed to Mazepa was inherited by his nephew, Andrei Stanislaus Woynarowski. When Andrei Stanislaus Woynarowski was taken prisoner by the Russians in 1716 and sent to Siberia, where he eventually died in captivity, he authorized Anna Woynarowska (then residing in Breslau with their children) to act as his proxy and demand payment of the debt from the Swedish king. Charles XII acknowledged the debt note as legitimate but did not pay it, and after his death in 1718, Anna Woynarowska traveled to the Swedish capital of Stockholm to demand payment from the Riksdag of the Estates. Woynarowska was but one of a very large crowd of the creditors of Charles XII demanding payment for financing the Great Northern War - it is mentioned that numerous of them arrived as late as 1731 and that their demands put a great pressure on state finances for years after the end of the war. The debt to Anna Woynarowska was however one of the largest and she became one of the most well known of these creditors. A debt of half a million was impossible for the Swedish crown to pay in the financial state after the war, and Anna Woynarowska was provided with a state allowance until the debt could be paid in full. In Sweden, Anna Woynarowska became known as \\"The Polish Countess\\" and the proceedings and negotiations between her and the Swedish state around the debt dragged on for years because of the poor state finances. Additionally, her state allowance was irregularly paid because of the near empty state treasury. In 1725, Anna Woynarowska was given a payment of four barrows of gold as well as the Tynnels√∂ Castle. She sold Tynnels√∂ in 1742 and left Sweden. References * Lundh-Eriksson, Nanna: Den gl√∂mda drottningen. Karl XII:s syster. Ulrika Eleonora D.Y. och hennes tid. Aff√§rstryckeriet, Norrt√§lje.

Formed in 1908, it was not part of any division, instead being assigned to Coastal Defence duties in Scottish Command. It was dissolved in early 1915 as its constituent battalions were posted to other formations. History The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. Three more infantry brigades also existed outside the divisional structure: the Black Watch Brigade, the Lothian Brigade and the South Wales Brigade. The brigade headquarters was at Dundee and, as the name would suggest, it was organized with four battalions of the Black Watch (Royal Highlanders): * 4th (City of Dundee) Battalion at Dundee * 5th (Angus and Dundee) Battalion at Arbroath * 6th (Perthshire) Battalion at Perth * 7th (Fife) Battalion at St Andrews 5th (Renfrewshire) Battalion, Princess Louise's (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) at Greenock was attached. The brigade was assigned to Scottish Coast Defences in Scottish Command. =World War I= In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course. Accordingly, the 2/1st Black Watch Brigade was formed as a duplicate formation in January 1915. On mobilization, the brigade took up its wartime stations in accordance with pre-war plans: 1/4th Black Watch at Buddon near Carnoustie, 1/5th at Broughty Ferry on Tay Defences, 1/6th at Queensferry on Forth Defences, 1/7th at Kinghorn also on Forth Defences; 1/5th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was also on Scottish Coast Defences. The brigade did not remain in existence for very much longer as the battalions were posted away. In October, the 1/5th Black Watch left for the Western Front, joining the 24th Brigade, 8th Division on 13 November. It was followed to France in February 1915 by the 1/4th Black Watch which joined the 21st (Bareilly) Brigade, 7th (Meerut) Division on 4 March 1915. On 16 April 1915, the 1/6th and 1/7th Black Watch departed for the 51st (Highland) Division, joining the 153rd (2nd Highland) Brigade at Bedford. Finally, the 1/5th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders joined the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division at Dunfermline on 24 April 1915. With that, the brigade passed out of existence.

Leslie Labowitz-Starus' work is in the permanent collection of the Hammer Museum and has been included in exhibitions at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the Getty Museum. Background and education Born in August 28, 1946 in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Labowitz- Starus is the daughter of an Auschwitz survivor. She earned her MFA from Otis in 1972, then moved to D√ºsseldorf, Germany, as a Fulbright Scholar. In D√ºsseldorf, Labowitz-Starus attended the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf where she briefly interacted with Joseph Beuys (he was dismissed from his position the semester she arrived).Sharon Irish, Suzanne Lacy: Spaces between (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2010), 203. Performance Art, 1977-1980 When she returned to Los Angeles in 1977, Labowitz-Starus worked at the Woman's Building, a cultural center just east of Chinatown in downtown Los Angeles devoted to feminist art and cultural change. From 1977 to 1980, Labowitz- Starus and Suzanne Lacy collaborated on a series of large-scale performances that often took place in public settings. Their first collaboration was In Mourning and in Rage. Together they founded ARIADNE: A Social Art Network, a support system for women artists. In 1977, Labowitz-Starus and Lacy created Three Weeks in May, an extended performance work designed to increase visibility and start conversations about sexual violence against women. Created in response to the Hillside Strangler murders in Los Angeles, the 21-day project involved more than 30 events, including demonstrations, news media interviews, and self-defense classes. One documented performance event which was a part of this project was \\"In Mourning and In Rage\\". The artists updated a map with reports from the Los Angeles Police Department, printing the word \\"rape\\" on spots on a map of the greater Los Angeles area wherever a rape was reported. This performance art activist piece took place on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall and garnered major media attention. In November 1978, Labowitz-Starus and Lacy organized a Take Back the Night march in San Francisco that attracted 3,000 participants. Marchers walked arched alongside a two-sided float with a Madonna on one side (which Labowitz-Starus created) and a skinned lamb on the other side (created by Lacy). In 1979 Labowitz performed \\"Record Companies Drag Their Feet\\", a feminist analysis of music album covers. Sproutime and Sprout Installations, 1979-1992 Starting in 1979 Labowitz-Starus increasingly began to think of growing sprouts by the terms of performance art. In the early 1980s, Labowitz-Starus created two ephemeral installations in New York City with the walls covered in sprouts. The artist began to grow and sell sprouts at local farmers markets. Labowitz- Starus decided to educate herself about business, learned bookkeeping, hired employees and by 1987, her company Sproutime grew 3,000 pounds of 50 varieties of lettuce and 25 spicy salad. After several years of working from her back yard in Venice, she bought a farm in a residential/agricultural area of Canoga Park. Between 1988 and 1992, Sproutime grew at a rate of 20 percent a year. Labowitz-Starus regularly employs artists, and considers Sproutime to be a work of interactive art whose participants include her co-workers and her customers.

Statements of Balances Mechanics are not based on assumptions and preconditions of a model but are of trivial arithmetic nature, usually shaped as equation and universal without restrictions. Balances Mechanics were developed by Wolfgang St√ºtzel and published in his books Paradoxa der Geld- und Konkurrenzwirtschaft (Paradoxes of Competition-Based Monetary Economies) and Volkswirtschaftliche Saldenmechanik (Balances Mechanics of Economics).Both texts have not been translated into English yet (03/2015). A summary in English is available in Charlotte Bruun's 1995 Dissertation: \\"Logical Structures and Algorithmic Behavior in A Credit Economy\\" (online ), Chapter 3: \\"The Logical Structure of a Monetary Economy\\", pp. 78-98 (online ) With the balances it becomes obvious: a national economy cannot save.Wolfgang Waldner, 13. Dezember 2013: flassbeck-economics: Die monet√§re Konjunkturtheorie von Keynes: \\"Es existiert ein Widerspruch zwischen dem, was gesamtwirtschaftlich sinnvoll, und dem, was f√ºr die Einzelnen vorteilhaft ist. Eine √ñkonomie kann kein Geld sparen, jede Einschr√§nkung der Ausgaben f√ºhrt zum Verlust von Einnahmen.\\" ()  Overview  Balances Mechanics deals with interrelations, the validity of which ‚Äì contrary to most economics postulates ‚Äì does not depend on assumptions about human behaviour.Adolf Wagner: Strukturwandel, Arbeitslosigkeit und Veprteilung. Marburg 2003, p. 491. Balances Mechanics allows to put these frequently necessary assumptions of economic theories and postulates onto a logic fundament of overall economics thinking (Size Mechanics). Previously false conclusions in pricing theory, theory of money, and trade cycle theory, resulting from single economy thinking (partial sentence) are overcome by a correct micro foundation and introduction of the real existing credit economy to the modeling (global sentence, size mechanics/relational sentence).Adalbert Winkler: Finanzsystementwicklung, Konsumentenkredite und Wirtschaftswachstum.

For example, from the view of the single economy experience it seems to be absolutely logical that rising expenses of a national economy go along with a rising need for medium of exchange in terms of quantity theory. From the view of Balances Mechanics one recognizes, with regard to the counter entry, that growing expenses in overall economy mean growing revenues as well and that, for instance, at payment lock step there is no correlation at all between overall sales volume and need for medium of exchange.Wolfgang St√ºtzel: Volkswirtschaftliche Saldenmechanik. T√ºbingen 2011. p. 232-233. Beside the mechanics of the real identities, in particular of buy surplus and sales surplus, it is just the insight from Balances Mechanics thinking that shows many issues, which commonly and with levity are viewed as connected, are not connected mechanically at all. St√ºtzel uses the term \\"problem plaitings\\" () when e.g. the equilibrium of the plans for changes of money assets are identified as invalid with the lock step of those changes and the steady state of the overall expenses or the capital stock. Similar applies to Balances Mechanics of ‚Äì strictly viewed as separated ‚Äì operations of money assets and operations of medium of exchange, which can only enable a self- consistent clarification of the interrelations between money system and real economy by using a clear distinction.Johannes Schmidt: Die Bedeutung der Saldenmechanik f√ºr die makro√∂konomische Theoriebildung. (PDF; 150 kB) p. 6 and following pages Balances Mechanics thus uses the interrelations of real identities and reveals serious fallacies of model making from wrongly assumed identities (ex ante equilibrium conditions/ex post identity equations).Michael Frenkel, Klaus Dieter John: Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnung.

Basic concepts  Book entry for credit creation = Credit creation and credit mechanics = Balances Mechanics considers the mechanics of private credit creation and recognizes the Credit Mechanics, which comes from Otto Pfleiderer and Wilhelm Lautenbach. (Wolfgang St√ºtzel often spoke of the \\"Lautenbachsche Kreditmechanik\\"). From the mechanics of giving a credit it becomes obvious: Once a debtor uses its credit entry,Deutsche Bundesbank, 2012: Geld- und Geldpolitik. p. 72: \\"Gesch√§ftsbanken schaffen Geld durch Kreditvergabe.\\" which corresponds to a liability, as payment for a purchase at the market, by Balances Mechanics this creates a surplus of the debtors expenses over its revenues. With that the remainder of the economy has a surplus of revenues over expenses. This business relationship (temporarily) created new fiat money (if the seller does not use the received money to pay back own active debts)Wilhelm Lautenbach: Zins, Kredit und Produktion. (Hrsg. Wolfgang St√ºtzel) T√ºbingen 1952. (PDF ) p. 48: \\"Leistet ein Kreditor an einen Debitor, so schrumpft die Kreditsumme, leistet ein Debitor oder einer, der durch die Zahlung Debitor wird, an einen, der nicht Debitor ist, so erh√∂ht sich die Kreditsumme. Sie bleibt aber gleich, wenn ein Debitor an einen anderen Debitor oder ein Kreditor an einen anderen Kreditor leistet.\\" () and in tendency leads to national economy value added.Deutsche Bundesbank, 2012: Geld- und Geldpolitik. p. 78: \\"Kreditvergabe und die damit verbundene Geldsch√∂pfung f√ºhren deshalb in der Tendenz zu Investitionen und vorgezogenem Konsum und auf diese Weise zu erh√∂hter Produktion und volkswirtschaftlicher Wertsch√∂pfung.\\" () This relativises common statements by classic theories which claim that so called capital collector locations would loan deposits from savers to debtors. Because the surplus of expenses of a debtor enables additional property to the economy (lowering liabilities, increasing monetary property) it is valid to say I => S, in no case the opposite.Wilhelm Lautenbach: Zins, Kredit und Produktion. (PDF ) p. 34: \\"Um den Gegensatz zur traditionellen Theorie besonders hervortreten zu lassen, kann man den Tatbestand pointiert so ausdr√ºcken: es wird nicht die Investition durch die Ersparnisse, sondern umgekehrt die Ersparnis durch die Investition bestimmt: Die Ersparnis ist ein reiner Verteilungsbegriff. Das Sparen entscheidet nicht √ºber die Gesamtgr√∂√üe der Investitionen sondern nur √ºber den Anteil der Wirtschaftssubjekte an dem Verm√∂genszuwachs den die Volkswirtschaft durch die Investition erf√§hrt.\\" () = Economic entities, groups and the overall economy = St√ºtzel distinguishes the totality of all economic entities (overall economy) and groups of economic entities. A group is defined as the totality of all economic entities minus at least one economic entity. * Group of economic entities < Sum of all economic entities (overall economy) Thereby a group also can be a single economic entity. Each group has a complementary group, so that the sum of group plus complementary group gives the overall economy. * Group + Complementary Group = Overall Economy Examples for groups are all private households of a national economy or all companies of a national economy. The group of private economic entities (private sector) is the sum of all companies and all private households. A national economy is a group as well. It is the sum of all economic entities of a nation (following the inland concept, these are all economic entities inside a state territorium; following the inhabitant concept, these are all economic entities of same nationality). The complementary group to the sector of private households are all not- households (state, companies, foreign countries). The complementary group of a national economy are all other national economies, the foreign country sector. So groups can be defined as needed and for a certain purpose. = Sentence categories = Three sentences about the relationship of groups and overall economy can be set: # Partial sentences: These are sentences, which are valid for groups and individual economic entities. # Global sentences: These are sentences, which are valid for the totality of all economic entities. # Size Mechanics: Tells under what conditions (the behaviour of the complementary group) statements for groups and single entities are valid (partial sentences). When a partial sentence is applied to the totality of economic entities then that is a fallacy of composition. Example: # Partial sentence: A company rises its sales volume when it lowers its prices. # Global sentence: If all companies lower their prices, sales do not change but the price level lowers. # Size mechanics: A company can only rise its sales volume if the complementary group (all other companies) keeps its prices. This example is an application of the paradox of competition (Konkurrenzparadoxon). = Single economy and overall economy buildup of money assets = For a single economic entity and groups of economic entities the partial sentence is valid, that the entities can rise their net-money assets by surplus of revenues (partial sentence): * Revenues ‚Äì Expenses = ŒîNet money assets Furthermore, it is valid that the expense of an economic entity A is the revenue of an economic entity B: * Expense A = Revenue B A purchase of a good by a customer leads to a revenue to the seller, the wage payment of an employer leads to the revenue of a worker and so on. Because every expense faces a revenue (and every revenue faces an expense) the sum of all expenses must be the sum of all revenues: * Sum revenues = Sum expenses From that the global sentence derives that the aggregate expense-revenue-balance of a closed aggregate economy equals zero (current account/performance record). This is valid for the global economy and closed national economies. Open national economies are groups because they can have a current account balance value. For them the partial sentence is valid that their net money assets can differ from zero. In addition, it is valid that every debt claim of an economic entity corresponds to a liability of an other economic entity, so that the sum of all claims necessarily corresponds to the sum of all liabilities: * Sum claims = Sum liabilities From that comes the global sentence that the aggregate net financial assets of a closed economy (all claims minus all liabilities) necessarily is Zero. The same is valid for changes of claims and liabilities: * Sum Œîclaims = Sum Œîliabilities Here the Global Sentence is: The totality of economic entities cannot rise or lower their overall net money assets. Change of net money assets, because expenses surpluses = revenues surpluses of the complementary group After all the Size Mechanics shows the conditions which make the partial sentence valid that individuals and groups can change their net money assets by expense- revenue-balances: * A group can only rise its net money assets (by surplus of revenue) if its complementary group (the remaining of all economy subjects, literally spoken the rest of the world) lowers its net money assets with the same amount (by an expenses surplus).  Balance of a single economic entity  Every economic entity (individuals, private households, companies, states, national economies etc.) has a balance sheet which consists of assets (activa) and liabilities (passiva). On the assets side there is the tangible assets (examples: machines, buildings, etc.) and the accounts receivable (examples: money, shares, bonds, etc.). On the liabilities side there are the liabilities and the net worth (also called equity). So it is valid for each economic entity: * net worth = tangible assets + claims ‚Äì liabilities Claims minus liabilities equals net money assets: * net money assets = claims ‚Äì liabilities The claims can be divided into medium of exchange and other claims: * claims = medium of exchange + other claims Generally all \\"other claims\\" can be converted into a medium of exchange by monetization. Debt claims against business banks are monetized claims because they commonly are accepted as fiat money as medium of exchange.  Application fields  = Analysis of money assets streams = The most essential application field of Balances Mechanics in economics is the analysis of changes in net financial assets. Net financial assets is the margin between claims and liabilities and changes with the expense-revenue-balances. In contrast to that, the money creation of the bank system generates medium of exchange against debt (in which an accurate demarcation of medium of exchange as part of the monetary assets is not possible). Revenue surpluses of a group are only possible if the complementary group enables an expense surplus. Economic relationships always are two-sided, because every expense comes up to a revenue and every debt to a claim. If an economic entity gains more than it spends, the complementary group must spend more than it gains: * Revenue surplus of one group = Expense surplus of the complementary group If individual economic entities cut their expenses, so that their expenses are lower than their revenues the global sentence is as follows: * A decline of expenses always leads to a decline of revenues and never to a revenue surplus.Wolfgang St√ºtzel: Volkswirtschaftliche Saldenmechanik T√ºbingen 2011 p. 76 At each economy subject (in the meaning of every individual) revenues and expenses can differ, for all economy subjects (in the meaning of all together) revenues and expenses compulsorily must be equal.Johannes Schmidt: Die Bedeutung der Saldenmechanik f√ºr die makro√∂konomische Theoriebildung. (PDF; 150 kB) p. 3 For example, it counts: Surplus of the private households (financial saving) = expenses surplus of the companies + expenses surplus of the state (state deficit) + expenses surplus of foreign countries (trade balance). The overall national accounts includes the revenues and expenses surplus (funding balances) of the individual sectors of the national economy (including the foreign sector) and thus it appears: the sum of funding balances of all individual sectors (difference between revenues and expenses) results to Zero.Ewald Nowotny: Gr√ºnde und Grenzen der √∂ffentlichen Verschuldung. In: √ñkonomie in Theorie und Praxis. Berlin und Heidelberg 2002. p. 261. = Action Concurrency and credit demand = Action Concurrency refers to the revenues and expenses balances of a group of agents in any period and describes their similarity in actions at the same time. St√ºtzel defines Action Concurrency as follows: \\"Action Concurrency occurs, when - by accidence - the same that applies to the overall economy, applies to individual agents, too\\" Wolfgang St√ºtzel: Volkswirtschaftliche Saldenmechanik. T√ºbingen 2011. p. 29 For example, if revenues would be fully spent (without delay) in favor of other agents and all other agents act the same way (strict revenue-expense concurrency), then the demand for credit of each of the agents would be zero. According to the Size Mechanics theorem, credit demand occurs only if the complementary group generates savings through spending less than is earned: \\"Credit demand is a function of the deviation from expenses concurrency, not a function of the level of expenses.\\" Wolfgang St√ºtzel: Volkswirtschaftliche Saldenmechanik. T√ºbingen 2011. p. 73 sowie Fu√ünote auf p. 74, wo St√ºtzel E. Lundberg und B. Senneby zitiert: Das Dilemma der neuen Geldpolitik. (Vierteljahresbericht der Skinddaviska Banken III/1956, Stockholm) = Balances Mechanics and Trade cycle theory = Balances Mechanics itself is no trade cycle theory, but it allows the accurate micro founding of the behaviour assumptions needed. At buyers markets the plans for consumption and investment determine the overall expenses, and with that the overall revenues and the economic cycle. Balances Mechanics allows, with the modeling of the real existing credit economy instead of an imaginary barter economy, to picture the influences of the financial system on the expenses plans. Balance Mechanics relationships The starting point is the balance of the individual economies' and the state's plans for building monetary assets. If the balance of the plans for building money assets (plans for sales surplus) has a surplus over the plans for money assets reduction (plans for buy surplus) this generates a negative momentum. As a consequence, economic actors overall -as expected- make less expenses in the following periods when they reduce money assets unplanned and make more expenses in the opposite case when their money assets increase by planning. This momentum is reinforced by the multiplier which results from the average willingness of the economic actors to accept unplanned changes of their money assets. Wolfgang St√ºtzel describes a theoretical edge case where the state at all costs wants to enforce a buildup of own money assets, but where no private actor wants to accept a reduction of its money assets: \\"Economy would instantly stand still.\\" He goes on: \\"In this case the Keynes-multiplier would be negative and of infinite number. Because the sum of plans to heighten money assets would at any revenue level exceed the concurrent plans for reducing money assets.\\"Wolfgang St√ºtzel: Volkswirtschaftliche Saldenmechanik. T√ºbingen 2011. p. 86. Balances Mechanics allows from the ex-post-analysis of the funding balances of the macroeconomic accounting (national accounts) as well as from the Balances Mechanics of national debt and in connection with only a few behavioral assumptions, to give very specific policy recommendations in order to limit national debt. In 2002 Ewald Nowotny for instance explained: \\"Significant for economy politics thereby is the compulsory Balances Mechanics relationship, that a policy aiming at reducing budget deficits (funding consolidation) can only be successful when it succeeds in reducing the financial surplus of the private households (e.g. by higher private consumption) and/or in rising the debt willingness of companies (for instance, by investments) and/or in improving the trade balance (for example, by additional export).\\"Ewald Nowotny: Gr√ºnde und Grenzen der √∂ffentlichen Verschuldung.

The film depicts the German invasion of Denmark which commenced on 9 April 1940 and follows a Danish bicycle infantry company sent as a vanguard to slow down the German advance until reinforcements can arrive. The film's budget was 22 million Danish krone (just over $3 million) and was supported by the Danish Film Institute, TV 2, and the Haderslev Municipality. The film was released in Danish cinemas on 12 March 2015. Plot During the night of 9 April 1940, the Danish army is alerted that the German army has crossed the border, and Denmark is now at war with Europe's strongest army. In South Jutland, a Danish bicycle infantry company and motorcycle platoon is ordered to hold off the German advance until reinforcements can arrive but are quickly overwhelmed by superior German forces. During the morning Second Lieutenant Sand (Pilou Asb√¶k) and his platoon of soldiers battle the Germans and then retreat to Haderslev.

The outline story was based on eyewitness accounts, conversations, and interviews with the few surviving veterans of 9 April 1940, who fought the invading German Army. The Mellem Slesvigs Gr√¶nser museum in Bylderup-Bov was approached by Nordisk Film in the autumn of 2013 with regards to assisting with uniforms and weapons. In March 2014, the film company collected 120 Danish steel helmets, 100 gas-mask canisters, 50 pairs of wool pants, 24 dummy-rifles, 32 cartridge belts, and a khaki officer coat. Moreover, the museum loaned two old Nimbus motorcycles with side-cars. All equipment was initially transported to Budapest, Hungary, where part of the movie was shot. The film was also shot in Haderslev, where the streets around M√∏llepladsen, S√∏nderbro, and Convent Cemetery were sealed off from 17 to 19 June 2014. Other shooting took place at Jacob Michelsen's Farm in Aabenraa and in S√∏g√•rdlejren. Reception The film received mixed, but generally favorable reviews from Danish critics, with Berlingske and Ekko giving it 5 out of 6 stars, while others gave it between 2-5 out of 6 stars.

It was built in 1886 by George Collier, a physics and chemistry professor at the University of Oregon, and his two sons to his own design. It was originally built as his residence but was sold to the University in 1893, when it joined Deady and Villard halls as the third building on the fledgling campus. It lies on the corner of University Street and 13th Avenue. Over the years the Italianate building has served as a dormitory, the university president's residence, the school's library, the faculty club, offices, a meeting space, and a restaurant and pub. As of autumn 2015, the building is used as classroom, office, and performance space by the musicology and ethnomusicology department in the School of Music and Dance. In October of 2018, it was announced that the University would be looking to build a new 60,000-square-foot classroom and faculty office building, and was exploring various sites on campus. One was the site of the Collier House, located on the corner of University Street and 13th Avenue. On October 19th, the Campus Planning Committee voted unanimously to recommend the current Collier House site as the location of the new classroom building. McArthur Court and the parking lot across the street from Prince Lucien Campbell (PLC) Hall were the other two options. Due to the Collier House being a Eugene historic landmark structure, the University had to approve a new location to move the building to, rather than simply tear it down. On November 27th, the Campus Planning Committee voted 9-1 to approve the Gerlinger Hall lawn as the new location for the Collier House. The exact location will be on the Eastern edge of the large lawn, near the intersection of University Street and 15th Avenue. The house will be moved sometime between 2019 and 2021, as construction of the new classroom building is slated to be complete in 2021.

Life She was born to general baron Hans Georg M√∂rner and Beata Schulman.

In 1692, she married riksr√•d count Claes Ekeblad the Elder. Hedvig M√∂rner was known for being able to influence state affairs and make successful recommendations for public offices through her political connections, and a large correspondence is preserved bearing witness of how much, often and how successfully she performed services for supplicants. In contrast to what was otherwise common, she did not work merely through her spouse, but entertained a large net of powerful contacts among the government and had a personal power base which she could use. In her private life, she and her sister were known to have a great interest in gambling. In 1734, she was involved in a conflict in the Riksdag. The opposition party of Arvid Horn worked to secure the position of field marshal for their sympathizer G√∂ran Silfverhielm. They asked M√∂rner, being the mother- in-law of Silfverhielm and the personal friend of the queen, to convince the queen to persuade the king to recommend the suggestion to the parliament. This resulted in a conflict between the king and Arvid Horn which developed in a serious crisis. This incident is regarded typical for her political activity. References * Norrhem, Svante (2007).

She had been working for several years at a spinning frame, in a cotton mill along with other children. She worked from 5.30 am till 8 pm, six days a week and nine hours on a Saturday. She absconded at least 10 times and was punished by her overseers. She is of interest because of the insight it gives into factory conditions, and the relationship with her mother. The ensuing Royal Commission, acted on her evidence and the Factory Acts were changed to regulate the use of children in factories. Family circumstances Ellen Hooton was born to Mary Hooton in 1822 or 1823. Thirty-two old Mary was unmarried. In 1829 she was a Dandy loom weaver. Ellen's father was also a weaver. Under terms of an order placed on him, Mary received 1s.6d. a week for child support until Ellen was four years old. She then received 1s. a week until Ellen was seven and a half, at which time payments stopped. The 1820s decade was difficult for weavers, Mary did not work from home but in a Dandy loom shop where several of these looms were housed - this would mean she did not own her own loom, and was paid for piece- work. The piece work rates were reduced by 33% in 1828 and by 29% in 1829 effectively Mary's income was almost halved. Ellen's father was by then out of work and so couldn't assist. By Ellen's account she entered the factory when she wasn't quite eight - though her mother claimed she was 'close upon nine years old'. The Factory Act of 1819 had prevented the employment of children under nine. For the first six months in the factory, Ellen received no wages and so was technically being trained not employed. Mary's earnings in 1828 would be around 5s. a week with an extra 1s. coming from the father. This dropped to 3s. a week. The average spinner in Wigan paid 1s. 6d. for rent and taxes and 1s. 2d. for fuel, soap, and candles: this left 4d. to spend on food. This however did not entitle her to any support from the parish. As a spinner tenting half a side, Ellen would earn 10¬Ωd. which would rise to 1s. 9d. for a full side: some girls managed 2 sides earning 3s. 6d. Historical context Wigan is a town in south-western Lancashire. It was no longer the \\"pretty market town built of stone and brick\\" as described by Celia Fiennes in 1698. It was a centre for coal production, and had a large number of handloom weavers who were struggling to exist. Prices fell as power looms were introduced into the mills. Wigan's status as a centre for coal production, engineering and textiles in the 18th century had led to the Douglas Navigation in the 1740s, and later the diversion of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to transport cloth and food grown on the West Lancashire Plain to the Port of Liverpool. With the expansion of industry coal became a valuable commodity. As a mill town, Wigan was an important centre of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution but it was the mill owners that profited. > The Handweavers' Plight \\"The cotton weavers who reside principally in the > neighbourhood of Bolton, Chorley, Wigan, Blackburn, Haslingden, Padiham, > Burnley, Colne and Todmorden are by far the most wretched body in this part > of the country. The number of cotton weavers in the places above mentioned > must exceed 60,000 and probably is near 100,000 and the utmost sum they can > earn per week, on a fair average working diligently from six (am) till eight > (pm), allowing out of that time an hour and a half for meals, is only 4 s., > even if the loom be their own, but if they have to hire the loom, they pay > 10d. a week for it, and they must also buy shuttles etc, and keep the loom > in repair. Great numbers cannot earn two shillings and six pence, three > shillings or three shillings and sixpence per week.\\" Extract from the > Liverpool Commercial Chronicle, April 24th 1826 To put these prices into perspective, in 1826 a pound of bread cost 2d. and a pound of butter 1s. Traditionally, Wigan had been a linen weaving area, relying on the hand loom: by 1826 the fibre was cotton and wages were falling. To the east, in Blackburn there was loom smashing and riots as the men tried to reverse the tide. By 1818 there were eight cotton mills in the Wallgate part of Wigan. In 1818 William Woods introduced the first power looms to the Wigan cotton mills. These mills swiftly became infamous for their dangerous and unbearable conditions, low pay and use of child labour. Wigan was always an important centre for coal production. By 1854 there were 54 collieries in and around the town, about a sixth of all collieries in Lancashire. Work in the mine was seen by the working class community as being a far lower status job for a child than one in a textile mill. Throstle spinning An early throstle frame in a US museum The throstle frame was an early method of spinning yarn, and was a direct descendant of the spinning wheel. The rovings were attenuated by rollers as in the later ring frame. The thread was collected on free spinning spindles which had a flyer above which acted as the twisting mechanism. The flyer always maintains a uniform velocity, though the bobbin retarded by friction, is pulled around the spindle by the tension of the yarn allowing the variation needed to account for the increasing diameter. It was very suited to producing high quality yarn of the coarser counts. Life and work Ellen Hooton was born in late 1822 or early 1823 in Wigan. In 1830 she started working in a throstle mill, owned by William Eccles. She didn't like it, was un-co-operative and repeatedly absconded and when the opportunity arose would steal money or other small items. Her mother had lied about her age to get her the job, Ellen would lie when questioned or surly, refuse to answer. Her mother took all her wages. She was not proud that she was earning a significant amount of money, or proud that of the financial interdependence in her family. Her relationship with her mother broke down, and her mother was prone to ask the overseer to help discipline her. Religion and the church were important at the time, and Ellen had never been into a chapel or church. She couldn't recite correctly the prayer that all children were expected to say as part of their bed-time ritual, it was over this that Ellen mother asked the overseer to intervene. Ellen found the work difficult and that she was unable to keep up. Ellen was expected to work from 5.30 am till 8.00 pm in the mill. Her job entailed looking after half a frame of throstles, this would probably be 32 ends. As she started, an experienced tenter (spinning operative) would have worked the other half, and been on hand to help her. In time she would have taken over the entire frame, with a consequent wage rise. Later this may have increased to two frames- or more as she trained up another youngster. There are three parts to the job: piecing any broken rovings, rovings can break at any time. The two loose ends are twisted back together in a way that keeps lumps out of the yarn, it is best done by small young fingers rather than large old arthritic ones. The cops have to be creeled, and the new rovings threaded through the rollers and the flyer and secured to the bobbin. Taller workers find this task easy. Full bobbins have to be doffed and replaced with empty ones. The operative has a degree of control over the timing of these two latter tasks- and throughout the shift would try and balance the timing so roving bobbins did not all run out together, producing a smoother and less stressful work flow. Ellen complained to her mother that she couldn't do this and couldn't 'keep all her ends up'. Ellen responded to the pressures by absconding, Mary responding by thinking Ellen was a bad child. Mary always returned Ellen to the mill where she would be punished. Mary sought the overseer to help her to discipline her child. She hoped he would act as a father figure. Mary felt she was out of control. While giving evidence to the examiner for the Central Board of His Majesty's Commissioners for inquiring into the Employment of Children in Factories, the overseer said: > Her mother has told me to take her to myself, and have her earnings, and > keep her on bread and water, and put a lock of straw in one corner of the > room for her to lie on. Her mother, on cross examination said: > I told him to take her, and he might have her earnings, and let her lie in > one corner of his room all night, to frighten her.

Elsewhere, overseers would beat children using rods and leather straps. kick them and slap them around the head with their fists. On other occasions, probably five times or more Ellen was weighted down with mill weights attached to her back by straps of the style used in the mines and had an oversized cap placed on her head and made to parade through the factory carrying a stick. This was designed to humiliate her, and send a message to other children. During the punishment the other workers were allowed to poke, punch and hit her. Subsequent life Ellen Hooton is not discussed in any literature subsequent to her appearance as witness at 10. Civil registration of births, marriages, and deaths in England and Wales was introduced on 1 July 1837. and a census taken every ten years since 1801. From these primary sources we can surmise that Ellen Hooton continued to work as a throstle spinner. She married Thomas Pye, a joiner in October 1841, giving her year of birth as 1821. They had a daughter Alice in 1845, but Ellen had died, (or left her family) by 1850. In 1851, her husband remarried. Alice herself married twice and died at the age of 30 in Chorley.

In 1590, she was married to the mayor of Horsens, burgher merchant Hans Olufsen Riber (d. 1615). The couple had seven children, two of whom died as infants. Her daughter Anne Svane (ca. 1596) was married to mayor of Horsens Ernst von Baden. One son Oluf Svane (ca. 1601) became mayor of Horsens.

Career Born on 24 January 1915 the son of Ermenegildo and Giovanna Lonfernini, Graziani developed an early interest in aviation, gaining his pilots license before the age of 20 at Rimini Airport with a Caproni Ca.100 thanks to the influence of Rodolfo Graziani. He joined the Regia Aeronautica and served initially flying Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bomber aircraft at the start of World War II. Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 flown by Graziani During 1940, he transferred to the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 and developed particular skill attacking shipping with torpedoes, initially in the Red Sea theatre and later over the Mediterranean Sea. He was injured in action attacking Port Sudan in December 1940 but successfully piloted his aircraft home, for which he was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor. On 13 October 1941, Graziani was involved in the attack on the battleships and , along with a fleet of four cruisers and twelve destroyers. He was also responsible for a night raid on shipping in the harbour at Philippeville which destroyed one ship and damaged another on 20 November 1942. Following the Armistice of Cassibile, Graziani flew Martin Baltimores for the Italian Co-belligerent Air Force, flying a total of 78 bombing missions.

History Mike was born in Britain, and early developed an interest in herpetology. While working as a volunteer at the British Museum, he was advised to go to Australia and Papua New Guinea if he wanted to do any ground-breaking research on amphibians. Around 1958‚Äì1959 he hitch-hiked to Australia. He joined the University of Adelaide staff as a laboratory technician in 1961, studying and researching part-time, and by 1971 had been promoted to Laboratory Manager, Department of Human Physiology and Pharmacology. In 1974 he qualified MSc, and in 1975 won a position as Lecturer, Department of Zoology. He was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1979 and was appointed Associate Professor of Zoology in 1984. In 2002 he was awarded D.Sc. and appointed Visiting Research Fellow. His research into amphibians both in Australia and overseas has been continuous and extensive, with support from organisations as diverse as the South Australian Museum (in 1965, his first overseas travel grant), the Mark Mitchell Foundation, Rotary International, Australian Geographic magazine, Hamilton Laboratories, Australian National University, Mount Isa Mines and the World Wildlife Fund. Apart from descriptive, habitat, behaviour, identification and taxonomic work, which includes identification of new species, his research has investigated novel chemicals which have found or may find, pharmaceutical and industrial uses such as fluid balance medications, sunscreens and adhesives. He has investigated frog populations as an indicator of the environmental health of aquatic systems and frog mutations as an indicator of pollution. He is one of many who have worked on Australia's Cane toad (previously Bufo marinus, now Rhinella marina) pest problem. He has been prominent in research into the world-wide phenomenon of the disappearance of frogs, even entire species, notably in Australia the two species of gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus vitellinus and Rheobatrachus silus), which were declared extinct shortly after their discovery). He has been in the forefront of research into Australia's fossil frog record. He has been very public in the promotion of frogs as pets, as sources of potentially useful substances, and as an indicator of environmental quality, arguing that a species useful to humans will necessarily be protected. He has been involved in a variety of nature documentaries, notably Nature of Australia (1988), ABC Natural History Unit in association with the BBC and WNET, broadcast within their Nature series, and David Attenborough's Life on Earth series (1979). He was a longtime member of the board of the South Australian Museum and its chairman 1982‚Äì1992.

Oil and tempera on oak panel, Frick Collection, New York Portrait of Thomas Cromwell is a small oil painting by the German and Swiss artist Hans Holbein the Younger, usually dated to between 1532 and 1534, when Cromwell, an English lawyer and statesman who served as chief minister to King Henry VIII of England from 1532 to 1540, was around 48 years old. It is one of two portraits Holbein painted of him; the other is a tondo from a series of medallions of Tudor courtiers.Strong, 276 The original panel is lost, and today known from three copies: in the Frick Collection in New York (where it is hung opposite Holbein's Portrait of Thomas More); in the National Portrait Gallery in London and the Chichester Constable collection in Yorkshire. The Frick panel is considered superior in quality.Strong, 277 Subject Portrait of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, c. 1585-1596 Thomas Cromwell was a lawyer and statesman who began as a blacksmith's son in Putney, and rose to power as an associate of Cardinal Wolsey. After Wolsey's fall and a period of initial distrust, he became a confidant of Henry VIII, assuming the roles of vicegerent, Lord Chancellor, lord high chamberlain, amongst others. A shrewd politician, he was aware of the effect of propaganda and commissioned Holbein to produce images positioning him as a reformist and royalist, including anti-clerical woodcuts and the title page for Myles Coverdale's English translation of the bible. In this he was both progressive and attuned to Henry VIII's grandiose programme of artistic patronage. The king's efforts to glorify his own status as Supreme Head of the Church culminated in the building of Nonsuch Palace, started in 1538.Strong, 5 Portrait of Sir Thomas More, 1527. Cromwell was instrumental in establishing the English Reformation, and played a key role in More's downfall Cromwell engineered the king's divorce from Catherine of Aragon. He was an early ally of Anne Boleyn but played a key role in her downfall. He was a significant force in the Tudor court until, hoping to strengthen the political alliance with the Protestant cause in Germany, he erred in advising Henry to marry Anne of Cleves.Cust, 5 The move was unpopular and afforded his many enemies the chance to bring charges of treason, forcing his eventual arrest and beheading. This left Holbein in an uncertain position; his guile had allowed him survive the downfalls of More and Anne, but Cromwell's sudden fall badly damaged his reputation.Wilson, 265Schofield, 260‚Äì64 Although he managed to retain his position as King's painter, his standing never recovered. Description The portrait dates from Holbein's second visit to England, when Cromwell was acting on behalf of Henry VIII and commissioned a series of propagandistic images of favoured courtiers at a time when Cromwell's reputation was at its highest. He had emerged as the \\"Protestant counterweight to Thomas More in the Privy council\\",Erickson; Hulse, 167 sealed Boleyn's position in bitter circumstance, and became one of the most influential and powerful men in England. At the same time he was cultured and instrumental in promoting Holbein's career.Erickson; Hulse, 167 Perhaps because of this, and given the portrait's genesis is steeped in the high and bloody politics of the time, with an unsteady king, we know nothing of Holbein's thoughts on the depiction. Cromwell is given due respect, but is presented as sour and somewhat stiff. The eyes are narrowly set, he tightly grips the seal. His reputation was poor until revision in the 1960s; today he is seen as a reformer and a highly capable, supreme political operator. Reflecting earlier opinion, it was noted that \\"of all the portraits that Holbein did at the English court, the portrait of Cromwell has always seemed the least flattering to its subject, the most viciously mocking.\\" Mindful of the protracted, fatal relationship between Cromwell and More, and their placing at the Frick, Henry Clay romantically asked that we \\"imagine Thomas More, the beautiful saint, and Cromwell, the monster, united in art and history, now facing each other, [through] Holbein and time and chance.\\"Erickson; Hulse, 169 This portrait miniature of Cromwell is derived from the 1532 portrait but shows him more tired and older. A similar miniature, without the Garter collar, survives and is attributed to Holbein by the National Portrait Gallery, but most scholars do not consider it an original Holbein Compared to Holbein's other portraits of Tudor politicians, Cromwell seems reduced; he is placed low in the frame, deep in the pictorial space, placing a distance and diminishing him from the viewer. The table reaches into the immediate foreground as if reaching into the viewer's personal space. Holbein presents Cromwell as somewhat sour, cold and grim, yet the portrait has been described as \\"a softened version of the subject\\". Historian R. B. Merriman described Cromwell as \\"a short, stoutly built man, with a large face, smooth shaven, with close-cropped hair, and a heavy double chin, with a small and cruel mouth, an extraordinary long upper lip, and a pair of gray eyes set closely together, and moving restlessly under his light eyebrows.\\"Goldwin, 541The same source compares Cromwell to Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, mentions criminal \\"intentions\\" and supposed \\"contempt for ordinary morality\\". See: Goldwin, 542 The inscription on the border reads \\"To our trusty and right well, beloved Councillor, Thomas Cromwell, Master of our Jewel House\\".

The version held by the Frick Collection in New York, is in oil on oak panel and measures .http://collections.frick.org/view/objects/asitem/items$0040:101 Attribution and dating The painting usually dated as c. 1532‚Äì4, when Cromwell was Master of the Jewel House The original portrait probably showed a painted scroll above his head, the text of the Frick version was removed during an early 20th restoration/improvement. The wording seems likely designed to position Cromwell beside the king. It read \\"To our trusty and right well beloved Councillor, Thomas Cromwell, Master of our Jewel House\\". the wording exists in a 1915 photograph of the Frick painting, but was removed. That panel underwent extensive technical analysis in 1952, and was cleaned in 1966; work that \\"did not substantiate an attribution to Holbein\\", but rather indicated the hand of a less skilled, workshop member. Provenance In an undated inventory from Cromwell's London home, an unknown writer mentions \\"2 tables of my master his (vis)namy painted\\". Little is known of the original after that. Only hours after Cromwell was taken to Traitors' Gate on 1 June 1540, soldiers arrived at his house to remove his belongings to the treasury, a fate that had befallen More some five years earlier. Holbein's portrait was most likely destroyed or sold soon after Cromwell's fall; there is no record of it in any later royal inventory. The first mention of copies is in the records of the Countess of Caledon from 1866 when she lent it to National Portrait Exhibition. That version is now in the Frick collection. Art scholar Roy Strong believed that the three extant portraits are copies. They are all in poor condition but the Frick version is the best preserved. Historian John Rowlands deduced from the pentimenti (alteration) revealed by X-ray photographs that the Frick version shows the hand of Holbein and is the original. The art historian Stephanie Buck agrees with the attribution, although it is highly contentious. Strong counters that as a traitor, Cromwell's personal effects were destroyed soon after his execution.  Notes  Sources * Beckingsale, B.W. Thomas Cromwell: Tudor Minister.

The album was initially released by the band in Australia in 2006 and, after additional re-mixing by D√≥nal Lunny at Longbeard Studios in Dublin, was re-released in the autumn of 2007 under license to Compass Records.Sleeve notes from Mozaik ‚Äì Changing Trains, Compass Records 744682, 2007. Recording The album opens with \\"O'Donoghue's\\", written and sung by Andy Irvine reminiscing about his early days in Dublin, when he first started frequenting this pub in August 1962. In eleven verses, he vividly recalls these happy times, naming many of the people who were part of his transition from actor to musician, leading to his touring days with Sweeney's Men and up to his departure \\"for the Pirin Mountains\\" in the late summer of 1968. On this first track, Liam O'Flynn joins Mozaik on whistle. Then comes the band's arrangement of \\"Sail Away Ladies/Walking in the Parlor\\", two old-timey tunes, the first recorded by Uncle Bunt Stephens, a Tennessee fiddler, in 1925 and the second by Dr D. Dix Hollis in Alabama, the same year. \\"The Wind Blows over the Danube\\" is a slow and mournful song, written and sung by Irvine, about a love affair in Hungary. \\"Reuben's Transatlantic Express\\", sung by Molsky, is Mozaik's arrangement of \\"Reuben's Train\\", with the inclusion of short segments of Romanian traditional tunes played between verses. The whole piece is performed at an accelerating pace and ends with a Romanian tune repeated in increasingly higher keys, thus further accentuating the aural effect of a runaway train gaining speed. \\"The Humours of Parov\\" was composed by Lunny in honour of bandmate Nikola Parov, to celebrate the distinction between the Bulgarian 'daychovo' (or 'daichevo') rhythm in time [2‚Äì2‚Äì2‚Äì3] and the Irish slip jig, which is in a different form of time [3‚Äì3‚Äì3]. Lunny also included a hybrid of these two rhythms he called 'slippy-daichevo' [3‚Äì2‚Äì2‚Äì2], which turns the daichevo rhythm around by playing the long beat first, to prepare for the slip jig that follows. O'Flynn also contributed uilleann pipes on this track. \\"The Ballad of Reynardine/Johnny C√∫ig\\" is a two-part piece arranged by Irvine. First, \\"The Ballad of Reynardine\\" is the old Irish ballad from County Tyrone which Irvine has set to the vigorous pace of the 'paidushka' rhythm (); second, \\"Johnny C√∫ig\\" is Irvine's re-interpretation of \\"Johnny Cope\\" (the hornpipe he recorded with Planxty on Cold Blow and the Rainy Night) from which he selected some of the parts and reset them to also, 'c√∫ig' meaning 'five' in Irish. For \\"Mary Rogers/Si√∫n N√≠ Dhuibhir\\", with O'Flynn again on uilleann pipes, Lunny wrote the first part in memory of his mother, as this was her maiden name; he also sings \\"Si√∫n N√≠ Dhuibhir\\", an Irish name which translates as 'Joan O'Dwyer'. \\"Train on the Island/Big Hoedown\\", begins with Molsky singing a beautifully plaintive song of separation (\\"Me and my gal, we fell out, it might be for the best\\") originating from Virginia, followed by a lively hoedown, an old-fashioned country dance from West Virginia. \\"The Pigfarm Suite\\" comprises two pieces: first, a slow tune in time that the Bulgarian tradition calls an \\"old-man's dance\\"; second, a new version of Irvine's \\"Paidushko horo\\" in (see the album Rainy Sundays... Windy Dreams from 1980), performed this time with an authentic Bulgarian traditional feel and arrangement. Finally, \\"Nights in Carrowclare\\" is another of the many songs Irvine learnt from Eddie Butcher. This one is a heartbreaking song of emigration to America, in which the lad leaves his girl behind. It was written in about 1870 by James McCurry, a blind fiddler from Myroe and it is listed under entry H169 in Sam Henry's collection, where it was recorded under the title of \\"The Maid of Carrowclare\\". Irvine's decorative accompaniment on mandolin provides beautiful harmonies to this song.

An unknown assailant fired seven or eight shots from a Makarov pistol; four of them hit Boris Nemtsov in the head, heart, liver and stomach, killing him almost instantly. He died hours after appealing to the public to support a march against Russia's war in Ukraine. Nemtsov's Ukrainian partner Anna Duritskaya survived the attack as its sole eyewitness. The assassination was met with worldwide condemnation and concern for the situation of the Russian opposition. Russian authorities also condemned the murder and vowed to conduct a thorough investigation. On 8 March 2015, Russian authorities charged Anzor Gubashev and Zaur Dadaev, both originating from the Northern Caucasus, with involvement in the crime. According to Russian authorities, Dadaev confessed to involvement in the murder. However, he later retracted his statement, as extracted by torture. Three more suspects were arrested around the same time and, according to Russian media, another suspect blew himself up in Grozny when Russian police forces surrounded his apartment block. Events Nemtsov was shot dead while crossing the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge Nemtsov was shot and killed crossing the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge near the Kremlin walking home after a meal out, in the company of Anna Duritskaya (), a 23-year-old Ukrainian model who had been his girlfriend for two and a half years. She witnessed Nemtsov's killing, but was not physically harmed herself. TV Tsentr's video of the bridge at the time of the murder shows that it occurred as a municipal utility vehicle was passing by Nemtsov and a person is seen escaping from the scene in a white or grey automobile. According to the Russian newspaper Kommersant, at the time of the murder all the security cameras in the area were switched off for maintenance. The only video of the incident was obtained from the video feed camera of TV Tsentr studio, from a long distance. At the time of the killing, the camera was blocked by a stopped municipal vehicle. The killing happened the day before Nemtsov was due to lead the opposition march Vesna (), a street demonstration organised to protest against economic conditions in Russia and against the war in Ukraine. Putin took \\"personal control\\" of the investigation into Nemtsov‚Äôs assassination. The killer was apparently waiting for Nemtsov on a side stairway leading to the bridge. At least six shots were fired, four of which hit Nemtsov; one wound was fatal. According to Kommersant sources, the killer used either a standard Makarov pistol or an IZh gas pistol modified for use with lethal ammunition. According to a witness, \\"a young man named Viktor M., who followed Nemtsov\\", the killer was a man of height, short haircut, medium build, dressed in jeans and a brown sweater. Investigation Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Investigative Committee, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Federal Security Service to create a single team to investigate the assassination of Nemtsov. The investigation team is headed by Igor Krasnov, who had previously investigated an attempt on the life of Anatoly Chubais and the murders of Stanislav Markelov and Anastasia Baburova. The team is supervised by the head of the Investigative Committee in Moscow, general Alexander Drymanov. Drymanov has also supervised the investigation against Nadezhda Savchenko, the second trial against Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, as well as the charges of genocide during the Russo-Georgian War against Georgian military. During the night following the assassination, Nemtsov's apartment on Malaya Ordynka street was searched and all documents and materials related to his business and political activities were confiscated. Opposition media raised concerns this was done to retrieve a draft of report on Russian involvement in the war in Donbass announced by Nemtsov shortly before his death. Partial information on the report's contents were later revealed by Nemtsov's friends. On 28 February, a white Lada Priora car possibly belonging to the assassin(s) was found abandoned. Russian state media reported that the car had a number-plate originating in the Republic of Ingushetia, although initial witnesses had stated that the white car involved in the shooting did not have any license plates. An underwater search in the Moscow River to retrieve the weapon presumably discarded by the killer after the assassination gave no result. A cash reward of 3 million rubles (~43,000 euros) is being offered for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer. Durytska, having testified before the investigative team, returned to Ukraine on 2 March. Because of reported threats to her life, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine Viktor Shokin provided Durytska with state protection. By 3 March, the official investigation concluded that Nemtsov had been tracked from 11:00 am when he met Durytska in Sheremetyevo Airport. Nemtsov had been followed by three alternating cars en route from the airport to the city. On 23:22 the group of killers was ordered to move to the assigned spot, when Nemtsov and Durytska left the GUM caf√©. On 23:29 the car with the assailant turned around under Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge and approached the stairs leading to the bridge. On 23:30 the assailant walked upstairs onto the bridge and moved towards Nemtsov and Durytska. Having walked past them, he turned around and fired at Nemtsov's back. After the assailant got into the car, it moved from the bridge to Bolotnaya Street, then to Bolshoy Kamenny Bridge, Mokhovaya Street and Tverskaya Street towards Okhotny Ryad and then turned to Bolshaya Dmitrovka before disappearing in local traffic. The car in which the assailant had escaped was later found and identified as grey ZAZ Chance. On 10 March Moskovskij Komsomolets published alleged CCTV photos of the suspects' vehicle, suggesting that they were following Nemtsov since September 2014, long before the Charlie Hebdo shooting.  Suspects  On 7 March 2015, the head of the Federal Security Service Alexander Bortnikov announced the arrest of two suspects, Anzor Gubashev and Zaur Dadaev (ru), both originating from the Northern Caucasus. According to Russian media, Zaur Dadaev had served in the Sever battalion of the Kadyrovtsy, while Anzor Gubashev had worked as a security guard for a Moscow hypermarket; according to other sources he is an employee of a private security firm. Both are from Ingushetia but for many years had been living outside the North Caucasus republic; they are related. They were formally charged on 8 March. Dadaev confessed to the crime; Gubashev denies any involvement.Shaun Walker (8 March 2015) Boris Nemtsov murder: Chechen chief Kadyrov confirms link to prime suspect The Guardian Three other persons were also detained as suspects, but not charged. All of them claimed they were innocent. According to Russian media another man blew himself up with a hand grenade in Grozny when police came to arrest him.Reuters (8 March 2015) Ramzan Kadyrov: Nemtsov suspect was a 'deep believer' angered by Charlie Hebdo. The Telegraph Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov (left) in June 2016 Zaur Dadaev, a former second-in-command to the leader of battalion Sever, Alibek Delimkhanov (the brother of Adam Delimkhanov and cousin of Ramzan Kadyrov), confessed that he had decided to kill Nemtsov because of his criticism of Islam and President of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov, according to Russian media. Dadaev apparently stated in his confession that his immediate manager during preparation of the murder was someone named Ruslik, who provided him with 5 million rubles, a ZAZ Chance car, and a gun. Investigators suspect that Ruslik is Ruslan Mukhudinov. Ruslan Mukhudinov's whereabouts are unknown, though he has been put on an international wanted list. Ruslan Geremeev is wanted to testify and as a suspect in connection with the case. Ruslan Geremeev was the head of a battalion Sever unit Zaur Dadaev served in, a subordinate of Alimbek Delimkhanov and a nephew of Suleiman Geremeev, a member of Federation Council of Russia. After the murder, Ruslan Geremeev was under protection in the Chechen republic and later probably left Russia for United Arab Emirates. In the end of April 2015 Ruslan Gereemev was reportedly officially assigned a status of a suspect. Commenting on the events, President of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov said that he knew Dadaev as one of the bravest warriors who had fought in the Russian-Chechen Kadyrovtsy regiment since its creation. Dadaev had been awarded the Order of Courage, the Medal for Courage and further awards by the Chechen Republic. According to Kadyrov, Dadaev was deeply religious and greatly offended by Charlie Hebdos publishing of the Muhammad cartoons and Nemtsov's support for the French cartoonists. However, the Kadyrovtsy were a secular unit fighting against radical Islamists and according to Dadaev's mother, her son had never mentioned Charlie Hebdo. Dadaev's mother also stated that her son was not a \\"strong believer\\" in Islam, and had in fact fought against Islamists (\\"Wahhabis\\") previously. Russia's opposition figures have called the theory that the murder was motivated by offense against Islam and the official line of inquiry by the Kremlin \\"more than absurd\\". Russian media reported that Dadaev retracted his confession, explaining that he only confessed to avoid \\"what happened to Shavanov\\" ‚Äì another suspect, who, according to the official version, blew himself up with a grenade during arrest attempt. A member of the Kremlin's advisory council on human rights, after visiting the suspects, said that Dadaev as well as the two other suspects, Anzor and Shagid Gubashev, most likely had been tortured while in detention. Just before his murder, Nemtsov had stated, \\"The contract between Kadyrov and Putin‚Äîmoney in exchange for loyalty‚Äîis coming to an end. Where will Mr Kadyrov's 20,000 men go? What will they demand? How will they act? When will they come to Moscow?\\" In late June 2017, five Chechen men were found guilty by a jury in a court at Moscow for agreeing to kill Nemtsov in exchange for 15 million rubles (US$253,000); neither the identity nor whereabouts of the person who hired them is known. In July 2017 Zaur Dadaev was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by a Russian court, while the other perpetrators were handed between 11 and 19 years each.  Criticism of the official investigation  At the end of October 2017 journalist David Satter published an article in National Review about an unofficial public investigation of the assassination.Who Killed Boris Nemtsov? 31 October 2017, www.nationalreview.com, accessed 4 September 2020 The investigation was led by Igor Murzin, a St. Petersburg lawyer who specializes in auto accidents and the interpretation of videotape.Russia Questions for Rex Tillerson 11 January 2017 www.hudson.org, accessed 4 September 2020 Murzin's investigation makes claims of official trial as being a cover-up, with real murderers never being under investigation. In June 2019, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) has called on the Russian authorities to re-open and continue the investigation, listing a number of what was called \\"serious concerns over its independence and effectiveness\\", and approved a report on the matter by Emanuelis Zingeris. PACE criticized the official version of the murder as \\"based on a severely flawed investigation and trial\\" and \\"inconsistent with the available evidence on numerous fundamental points\\". According to its unanimously approved resolution, alternative versions that Russian authorities have refused to explore are far more consistent with the available evidence. The Assembly invited states that have adopted Magnitsky laws to consider sanctions against those responsible for what it called \\"an investigation failure\\".

She said she would stop only when the person or people who ordered Nemtsov's murder are arrested and sentenced, * Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev suggested that the killing was a provocation: \\"It‚Äôs an attempt to push the situation into complications, maybe even to destabilising the situation in the country.\\" * Irina Khakamada, a prominent opposition figure who co-founded a liberal party with Nemtsov, stated: \\"It's a provocation that is clearly not in Putin's interests, it's aimed at rocking the situation.\\" * Kremlin-appointed investigators have speculated that the assassination could have been \\"a provocation aimed at destabilising the country\\" or that it was motivated by \\"Islamic extremism\\". Catherine A. Fitzpatrick has dismissed such speculations by referring to them as \\"conspiracy theories\\", and The Guardian noted that the only explanation that is not being considered by the authorities is the \\"blindingly obvious one\\" that Nemtsov was killed for his criticism of Putin. A Kremlin spokesman said \\"It is too early to make any sort of conclusions but we can say with 146% certainty that it is a provocation.\\" A spontaneous memorial took place at the scene of the murder. People carried flowers along with posters emblazoned Je suis Boris, as an echo of the Je suis Charlie response to the Charlie Hebdo shooting two months earlier in Paris. On 1 March, a silent one-person rotating commemoration was held in Murmansk; a court later convicted Irina Paykacheva of involvement in the unsanctioned event and fined her 20,000 roubles. In August 2017, an activist guarding a Nemtsov memorial, Ivan Skripnichenko, was killed by a Putin supporter. Mourners have held an around-the-clock vigil for late Nemtsov, which into its fourth year, as of 2018. =Outside Russia= In Armenia, a parliamentary opposition party, the Armenian National Congress, released a statement condemning the murder. The independent opposition MP Nikol Pashinyan offered condolences to Nemtsov's family and stated that his murder is a \\"major challenge\\" for Russia to overcome. The speaker of the Polish Senate, Bogdan Borusewicz, said that Nemtsov \\"fell victim\\" to \\"a chauvinistic campaign against people who do not agree with imperialistic policies and aggression against a neighbouring country.\\" =Media reactions= Leonid Bershidsky of the Bloomberg View stated that \\"In recent months, Putin's propaganda machine has been vigorously inciting Russians against the 'fifth column' ‚Äì those who protested against the annexation of Crimea and the Kremlin-instigated war in eastern Ukraine. Nemtsov was on every list of traitors published on the Internet and aired on state TV.\\" In The Daily Telegraph, Ben Judah wrote that the Kremlin \\"either ordered or allowed [Nemtsov's murder] to happen\\", saying that \\"Nothing Boris Nemtsov did was not bugged, tailed, filmed or monitored by the secret police. It is quite simply impossible that this man could have been shot dead without the Kremlin knowing there was a plot afoot to kill him.\\" Some saw parallels with the murder of Sergey Kirov in 1934. Brian Whitmore, writing for Radio Free Europe, stated that the murder indicated the development of a \\"hybrid Great Terror campaign\\" against Putin's opposition. The BBC referred to an interview Nemtsov gave on 10 February 17 days before his death, in which Russia's Sobesednik newspaper reported that Nemtsov said that his mother was afraid Russian President Vladimir Putin would kill him. He added that his 86-year-old mother is also afraid for the lives of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Alexey Navalny. When asked if he himself feared for his life, Nemtsov answered, \\"Yes, not as strongly as my mother, but still...\\" After the BBC referred to that interview, on 27 February 2015, the Sobesednik posted an extended version of the original interview, in which Nemtsov reportedly added, \\"I am just joking. If I were afraid of Putin, I wouldn't be in this line of work.\\" Memorial march Boris Nemtsov was an organizer of the anti-crisis and anti-war march Vesna (\\"Spring\\") planned on 1 March 2015. After the murder, the organizers transformed the planned march into a memorial for Nemtsov. The participants marched from Kitay-gorod to Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge where Nemtsov was murdered. According to the organizers more than 50,000 people took part in the march, while Moscow police counted 21,000 participants. Around 50 people were arrested for disobedience to police including Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada deputy Oleksiy Honcharenko. According to Honcharenko, he was beaten and deprived of medical and legal help while in detention. Honcharenko was released from prison the next day, but he promised to sue Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. On 1 March, simultaneously with Moscow marches Nemtsov memorial marches were held in Saint Petersburg (finished with a meeting on the Field of Mars), Yekaterinburg, Murmansk London and Paris. 10,000 to 22,000 people marched in Moscow in memory of Boris Nemtsov on February 29, 2020. 2,000 people marched in St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, and Vladivostok.Thousands march in memory of slain Russian opposition leader AP, 20 Feb 2020 Funeral Nemtsov was buried on 3 March 2015 at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. Latvian MEP Sandra Kalniete and Speaker of the Polish Senate Bogdan Borusewicz were not allowed to attend the funeral due to travel bans imposed by Russia. The travel bans bar certain EU and Western politicians from visiting Russia for their alleged \\"anti- Russian activities\\". Russia's sanctions were imposed in response to Western- led sanctions against officials close to the Kremlin for their alleged conduct during the Ukrainian Crisis. Kalniete stated that \\"Since I have always taken a clear and explicit language on Russia's role in Ukraine, I had suspicions that it could happen.\\" The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, called the ban a \\"high affront\\". A Russian court decided not to grant the request of Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition leader jailed for 15 days for distributing fliers, for a temporary release to attend the funeral. Boris Nemtsov Plaza Boris Nemtsov Plaza in front of the Russian embassy in Prague, Czech Republic On 6 December 2017, Nemtsov's daughter Zhanna Nemtsova traveled from Germany, accompanied by other family members and Russian dissidents, to urge members of the Council of the District of Columbia--Washington, D.C.'s legislature--to rename a portion of the street in front of the Russian Embassy \\"Boris Nemtsov Plaza\\" in honor of her father and as a signal to Russian authorities of US disapproval of their policies and of their alleged role in Nemtsov's assassination. Legislation to formally make the change was co- sponsored by Council chairman Phil Mendelson, who expected the bill to be approved by Council early in 2018. On 9 January 2018, the Council unanimously approved the \\"Boris Nemtsov Plaza Designation Act of 2017\\" which authorized the renaming, effective 5 May 2018. In February 2020, the square outside the Russian embassy in Prague, Czech Republic was renamed to Boris Nemtsov Plaza.

The band emerged as other popular British acts like The Hollies and The Dakotas were also coming to prominence in Manchester. They were the first band to record \\"I'm Alive, which inspired The Hollies to also record the song. The band released two singles, but never were able to achieve success outside of the local scene or in the United States. Still, the band members went on to perform in more prominent musical acts. History In 1963, the band's original line-up of Bob Smith on lead vocals, Frank Renshaw on lead guitar, Keith Meredith on rhythm guitar, Ken Mills on bass guitar, and Graham Smith on drums. The band formed out of the remains of their past bands, Lee Shondell and the Premiers of Beat and Gaye and the Guys. Renshaw was appointed as the band's leader, as he had the lengthiest musical career, thus far. Mike Cohen, the manager of The Hollies, was impressed by the band's first rehearsal in a pub called \\"The Thatchers Arms\\", so he agreed to manage them as well. Their name was based on the clothing store, \\"The Toggery\\". The store became a place for groups to acquire clothes, like several other bands, including the Beatles. The band began playing around Manchester, gaining a local following by playing R&B; standards. Renshaw sang the majority of the vocals as Smith could not sing to the style of music, limiting his role to tambourine player. Smith became dissatisfied with losing his spot as lead vocalist and left. In 1964, the band replaced him with Paul Young, who was only 16 years old at the time. Still, with the lack of rehearsals, Young was also limited to tambourine playing, and would not sing on the band's first recording. In September 1964, the band performed on the television show, Ready, Steady, Win, which included judges like Brian Epstein. First prize was a recording contract with Decca Records. The band was able to reach the finals and played the song \\"Dance With You\\", but lost to The Bo Street Runners. Initially, the band won the contest, but through intervention by Decca Records, the judges were persuaded to vote them runner-up because the band had signed a contract with the Parlophone label earlier. On 18 September 1964, the band released their first single, \\"I'm Gonna Jump\\" b/w \\"Bye Bye Bird\\", which was recorded at Abbey Road Studios. The A-side was based on a man who desired to jump into a river after his girlfriend left him. \\"I'm Gonna Jump\\" received positive reviews from critics, but BBC Radio banned its radio play because of the controversy surrounding the theme. As a result, the debut single flopped in England and on its US release on the Tower label. Despite the disappointing sales, the band continued to appear on television and received steady gigs throughout England. They opened for acts like Freddie and the Dreamers and The Hollies. In January 1965, the group returned to Abbey Road Studios for their second single. They recorded \\"I'd Much Rather Be with the Boys\\" as their A-side. The Rolling Stones recorded a demo of the song, but did not release it until it was placed on their compilation album, Metamorphosis. This, along with their B-side \\"It's So Easy\\", was put out on 26 February 1965 as their second single and it fared better in sales, but, again, failed to chart. In mid-1965, the band recorded new material for the last time. They received a song from Gene Pitney, called \\"I'm Alive\\" as it was rejected by others it was offered to. The Hollies heard demos by the band and decided to produce a version of their own. Their version was released two weeks before The Toggery Five's planned distribution. The Hollies achieved a number one hit, preventing the Toggery Five from reaching national success. They were then offered a Hollies' composition, \\"Going Away\\", which they recorded but never released. Renshaw left the band to play behind Wayne Fontana, and they regrouped with several new line-ups to perform until their disbandment in 1966. Among the new personnel were Mick Abrahams and Clive Bunker, founding members of the band, Jethro Tull. Paul Young became lead singer with Mike and the Mechanics and died of a heart attack in 2000.

She was the daughter of secretary and land minister Christian von Rantzau (1649-1704) and Margrethe von Rantzau (1642-1708). She was married in 1711 to Hans Schack, count of the County of Schackenborg. Hans Schack was a widower and had a son and heir, Otto Didrik Schack (1710-1741). Hans Schack died in 1719, and his widow was assumed his position as county administrator of Schackenborg. She also became manager of her husband's estate as guardian of her stepson. Over the years, her activities as landowner became more extensive. At Giesegaard she built a new main building, and at Gram she rebuilt a manor house, Schloss Gram. She increased the manor and estate at Juellund in 1752 and in 1730 she acquired the Nyb√∏lg√•rd estate in North Schleswig. The year before she had bought Thotts Palace at Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen and in 1754 she took over Amalienborg. Her relationship with her stepson, Otto Didrik Schack, was never the best and worsened over the years. In 1741, her step-son died. His heir was his eldest son, Hans Schack (1735-1796). Shortly before her death in 1760, she set up a will in which she completely bypassed Hans Schack in favor of his younger brother Frederik Christian Schack (1736-1790). In 1758, a commission had to be set up to settle the resulting disputes.

It was dissolved in early 1915 as its constituent battalions were posted to other formations. History The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. Three more infantry brigades also existed outside the divisional structure: the Black Watch Brigade, the Lothian Brigade and the South Wales Brigade. The brigade headquarters was at Cardiff and, as the name would suggest, it was organized with four battalions recruited in South Wales: * Brenockshire Battalion, South Wales Borderers at Brecon * 4th Battalion, Welsh Regiment at Carmarthen * 5th Battalion, Welsh Regiment at Pontypridd * 6th (Glamorgan) Battalion, Welsh Regiment at Swansea It was an Army Troops formation but it was attached to the Welsh Division in peacetime. =World War I= The brigade was mobilized on 4 August 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War.

After a visit to Venice he went to Rome, where he attended several schools and associated with other Spanish artists who were studying there. One of them, Jos√© Villegas Cordero, had difficulty pronouncing Etxenagusia's Basque name, calling him \\"Echena...and I don't know what\\". The shortened name stuck and Etxenagusia began using it as his signature. He was strongly influenced by the works of Giambattista Tiepolo and began producing historical scenes of soldiers and courtiers. Later, he came under the influence of the Nazarene movement. He returned home in 1882 and shortly found work, designing heraldry and costumes for the Holy Week procession in addition to creating a mural of Christ at Calvary for the Church of Santa Maria. One of his most ambitious works depicted Christ at Golgotha (now lost). It was awarded a medal at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts in 1884, reproduced by Goupil & cie and widely distributed. Later, he provided murals for the Biscay Foral Delegation Palace and the Chavarri Palace and made a successful tour of England. By the early 1890s, he was back in Rome, where he opened an art gallery and became a teacher at the Academia Chigi. He remained there for the rest of his life, with occasional stays in Florence and Venice. He died of malarial fever in Rome. After his death, a major retrospective of his works was held in Donostia.

They number around 400,000 in the wider definition. Between June 1949 and September 1950, the overwhelming majority of Yemen and Aden's Jewish population was transported to Israel in Operation Magic Carpet. History =First wave of modern emigration: 1881 to 1914= Due to the changes in the Ottoman Empire, citizens could move more freely, and in 1869, travel was improved with the opening of the Suez Canal, which reduced the travel time from Yemen to Ottoman Syria. Certain Yemenite Jews interpreted these changes and the new developments in the \\"Holy Land\\" as heavenly signs that the time of redemption was near. By settling in Ottoman Syria, they would play a part in what they believed could precipitate the anticipated messianic era. Emigration from Yemen to the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem (Ottoman Syria) began in early 1881 and continued almost without interruption until 1914. It was during this time that about 10% of the Yemenite Jews left. From 1881 to 1882, a few hundred Jews left Sanaa and several nearby settlements. This wave was followed by other Jews from central Yemen who continued to move into Ottoman Syrian provinces until 1914. The majority of these groups moved into Jerusalem and Jaffa. In 1884, some families settled into a new-built neighborhood called Yemenite Village Kfar Hashiloach () in the Jerusalem district of Silwan, and built the Old Yemenite Synagogue. Before World War I, there was another wave that began in 1906 and continued until 1914. Hundreds of Yemenite Jews made their way to Ottoman Syria and chose to settle in the agricultural settlements. It was after these movements that the World Zionist Organization sent Shmuel Yavne'eli to Yemen to encourage Jews to emigrate to the Land of Israel. Yavne'eli reached Yemen at the beginning of 1911 and returned to Ottoman Syria in April 1912. Due to Yavne'eli's efforts, about 1,000 Jews left central and southern Yemen, with several hundred more arriving before 1914.The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times, by Reeva Spector Simon, Michael Menachem Laskier, Sara Reguer editors, Columbia University Press, 2003, page 406 =1920 to 1940s= Yemenite Jews en route from Aden to Israel. In 1922, the government of Yemen, under Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din (Imam Yahya), re-introduced an ancient Islamic law entitled the \\"orphans decree\\". The law dictated that, if Jewish boys or girls under the age of twelve were orphaned, they were to be forcibly converted to Islam, their connections to their families and communities were to be severed, and they had to be handed over to Muslim foster families. The rule was based on the law that the prophet Mohammed is \\"the father of the orphans\\", and on the fact that the Jews in Yemen were considered \\"under protection\\", and the ruler was obligated to care for them.Our man in Sanaa: Ex-Yemen president was once trainee rabbi Haaretz A prominent example is Abdul Rahman al-Iryani, the former president of the Yemen Arab Republic, who was alleged to be of Jewish descent by Dorit Mizrahi, a writer in the Israeli ultra-Orthodox weekly Mishpaha. She claimed to be his niece due to his being her mother's brother. According to her recollection of events, he was born Zekharia Hadad in 1910 to a Yemenite Jewish family in Ibb. He lost his parents in a major disease epidemic at the age of eight, and, together with his 5-year-old sister, he was forcibly converted to Islam, and they were put under the care of separate foster families. He was raised in the powerful al-Iryani family, and adopted an Islamic name. al-Iryani would later serve as minister of religious endowments under northern Yemen's first national government, and he became the only civilian to have led northern Yemen.Abdul-Rahman al-Iryani, Ex-Yemen President, 89 ‚Äì The New York Times, March 17, 1998. However, YemenOnline, an online newspaper, claimed to have conducted several interviews with several members of the al-Iryani family and residents of Iryan, and alleges that this claim of Jewish descent is merely a \\"fantasy\\" started in 1967 by Haolam Hazeh, an Israeli tabloid. It states that Zekharia Haddad is, in fact, Abdul Raheem al-Haddad, Al-Iryani's foster brother and bodyguard who died in 1980. Abdul Raheem is survived by tens of sons and grandsons. =1947-1950= Yemenite Haganah member on guard duty at moshav Elyashiv In 1947, after the partition vote of the British Mandate of Palestine, Arab Muslim rioters, assisted by the local police force, engaged in a pogrom in Aden that killed 82 Jews and destroyed hundreds of Jewish homes. Aden's Jewish community was economically paralyzed, as most of the Jewish stores and businesses were destroyed. Early in 1948, the unfounded rumour of the ritual murder of two girls led to looting.Howard Sachar, A History of Israel, (NY: Alfred A. Knopf, 1979), (pp. 397‚Äì98.) This increasingly perilous situation led to the emigration of virtually the entire Yemenite and Adenese Jewish communities. During this period, over 50,000 Jews emigrated to Israel. Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen) began in June 1949, and ended in September 1950.Tudor Parfitt The Road to Redemption: The Jews of the Yemen, 1900‚Äì1950, (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1996), pages 229‚Äì245 Part of the operation took place during the hostilities of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War (May 15, 1948 ‚Äì March 10, 1949). The operation was planned by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. The plan was for the Jews from all over Yemen to make their way to the Aden area. Specifically, the Jews were to arrive in Hashed Camp and live there until they could be airlifted to Israel. Hashed was an old British military camp in the desert, about a mile away from the city of Sheikh Othman.Tudor Parfitt The Road to Redemption: The Jews of the Yemen, 1900‚Äì1950, (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1996), pages 203‚Äì227 The operation took longer than was originally planned. Over the course of the operation, hundreds of migrants died in Hashed Camp, as well as on the plane rides to Israel. By September 1950, almost 50,000 Jews had been successfully airlifted to the newly formed state of Israel. According to an official statement by Alaska Airlines: :When Alaska Airlines sent them on \\"Operation Magic Carpet\\" 50 years ago, Warren and Marian Metzger didn't realize that they were embarking on the adventure of a lifetime. Warren Metzger, a DC-4 captain, and Marian Metzger, a flight attendant, were part of what turned out to be one of the greatest feats in Alaska Airlines' 67-year history: airlifting thousands of Yemenite Jews to the newly created nation of Israel. The logistics of it all made the task daunting. Fuel was hard to come by. Flight and maintenance crews had to be positioned through the Middle East. And the desert sand wreaked havoc on engines. :It took a whole lot of resourcefulness throughout the better part of 1949 to do it. But in the end, despite being shot at and even bombed upon, the mission was accomplished ‚Äì and without a single loss of life. \\"One of the things that really got to me was when we were unloading a plane at Tel Aviv\\", said Marian, who assisted Israeli nurses on a number of flights. \\"A little old lady came up to me and took the hem of my jacket and kissed it. She was giving me a blessing for getting them home. We were the wings of eagles.\\" :For both Marian and Warren, the assignment came on the heels of flying the airline's other great adventure of the late 1940s: the Berlin Airlift. \\"I had no idea what I was getting into, absolutely none\\", remembered Warren, who retired in 1979 as Alaska's chief pilot and vice president of flight operations. \\"It was pretty much seat-of- the-pants flying in those days. Navigation was by dead reckoning and eyesight. Planes were getting shot at. The airport in Tel Aviv was getting bombed all the time. We had to put extra fuel tanks in the planes so we had the range to avoid landing in Arab territory.\\"Operation Magic Carpet, Golden Anniversary: Alaska Airlines helped roll out a Magic Carpet to Israel, Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air web-site, Many Yemenite Jews became irreligious through the re-education program of the Jewish Agency. =Later emigration= A smaller, continuous migration was allowed to continue into 1962, when a civil war put an abrupt halt to any further Jewish exodus. In February 2009, 10 Yemeni Jews immigrated to Israel, and in July 2009, three families, or 16 people in total, followed suit. In January 2013, it was reported that a group of 60 Yemenite Jews had immigrated to Israel in a secret operation, arriving in Israel via a flight from Qatar. This was reported to be part of a larger operation which was being carried out in order to bring the approximately 400 Jews left in Yemen to Israel in the coming months. In March 2016, it was reported that the Jewish Agency brought 19 of the last remaining Yemenite Jews to Israel in a covert operation. 14 came from the town of Raydah, while one family of five hailed from the capital, Sanaa. The group from Raydah included the community's rabbi, who brought a Torah scroll believed to be between 500 and 600 years old. It was reported that in 2018 there were around 50 Jews remaining in Yemen.Jewish Virtual Library - Jews of Yemen Notable people *Yisrael Yeshayahu *Boaz Mauda *Shahar Tzuberi *Amnon Yitzhak *Gali Atari *Bracha Qafih *Shoshana Damari *Ofra Haza *Eyal Golan *Harel Skaat *Dana International *Achinoam Nini *Yigal Amir *A-WA *Pe'er Tasi *Ravid Kahalani *Zohar Argov  See also  *Aliyah *Arabic language in Israel *History of the Jews in Yemen *Austerity in Israel *Ma'abarot *Yemenite Children Affair *Ringworm affair  References  Category:Israeli Jews by national origin Category:Yemeni emigrants to Israel Israel ","title":"Yemenite Jews in Israel"},{"id":"45527641","text":"Deliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant since 2014 in Iraq, Syria, and to a lesser extent in Libya. The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the fall of Mosul in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL had plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings. Valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to foreigners to finance the running of the Islamic State. By March 2019, ISIL lost most of its territory in the Middle East. Motivation ISIL justifies the destruction of cultural heritage sites with its following of Salafism, which, according to its followers, places \\"great importance on establishing tawhid (monotheism)\\", and \\"eliminating shirk (polytheism).\\" While it is often assumed that the group's actions are mindless acts of vandalism, there is an ideological underpinning to their destruction of Islamic, non-Islamic, historical and cultural heritage sites. ISIL views its actions in sites like Palmyra and Nimrud as being in accordance with Sunni Islamic tradition. Beyond the ideological aspects of the destruction, there are other, more practical, reasons behind ISIL's destruction of historic sites. Grabbing the world's attention is easily done through the destruction of such sites, given the extensive media coverage and international condemnation that comes afterwards. Destroying historic ruins also allows ISIL to wipe the slate clean and to start afresh, leaving no traces of any previous culture or civilization, while also providing an ideal platform for the group to establish its own identity and leave its mark on history. Despite the images showing extreme destruction, ISIL has also been making use of the looted antiquities to finance their activities. Despite the UN's ban on the trade of artifacts looted from Syria since 2011, the group has been smuggling these artifacts out of the Middle East and on to the underground antique markets of Europe and North America. Destroyed heritage Prophet Jonah (Nabi Yunus) Mosque in Mosul, pictured in 1999. It was destroyed by ISIL in 2014. =Mosques and shrines= In 2014, media reported destruction of multiple, Sunni and Shiite, mosques and shrines throughout areas captured by ISIL. Among them were the Al-Qubba Husseiniya Mosque in Mosul, Sheikh Jawad Al-Sadiq Mosque, Mosque of ArnƒÅ‚Äô≈´t, Mosque of Qado, Mosque of Askar e- Mullah and Saad Bin Aqeel Shrine in Tal Afar, Sufi Ahmed al-Rifai Shrine and tomb and Sheikh Ibrahim shrine in Mahlabiya District and the so-called Tomb of the Girl (Qabr al-Bint) in Mosul. The Tomb of the Girl, reputed to honour a girl who died of a broken heart, was actually believed to be the tomb of medieval scholar Ali ibn al-Athir. In June 2014, ISIL bulldozed the two buildings in the complex of the shrine of Fathi al- Ka'en. On 24 September 2014, the Arba'een Wali Mosque and Shrine in Tikrit, containing forty tombs from the Umar era, was blown up. On 26 February 2015 ISIL blew up the 12th century Green Mosque in central Mosul. In Mosul, ISIL also targeted several tombs with shrines built over them. In July 2014, ISIL destroyed one of the tombs of prophet Daniel (located in Mosul) by planted explosives. On 24 July 2014, the tomb and mosque of the prophet Jonah was destroyed with explosives. On 27 July, ISIL destroyed the tomb of Prophet Jirjis (George). On 25 July 2014, the 13th-century shrine of Imam Awn al-Din in Mosul, one of the few structures to have survived the 13th-century Mongol invasion, was destroyed by ISIL. The destruction was mostly carried out with explosive devices, but in some cases bulldozers were used. In March 2015, ISIL reportedly bulldozed to the ground the Hamu Al-Qadu Mosque in Mosul, dating back to 1880. The Hamu-Al-Qadu mosque contained an earlier tomb of Ala-al-din Ibn Abdul Qadir Gilani. In the same year ISIL ordered the removal of all decorative elements and frescoes from mosques in Mosul, even those containing Quranic verses that mention Allah. They were regarded by ISIL as \\"an erroneous form of creativity, contradicting the basics of sharia.\\" At least one imam in Mosul opposing that order was shot to death. Battle of Mosul. In 2016, ISIL destroyed the Minaret of Anah located in Al Anbar Province, which dates back to the Abbasid era.

This was the mosque where ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared the establishment of the Islamic State caliphate three years prior. =Churches and monasteries= Dair Mar Elia monastery, which was destroyed sometime between late August and September 2014 In June 2014, it was reported that ISIL elements had been instructed to destroy all churches in Mosul. Since then, most churches within the city have been destroyed. * The Virgin Mary Church was destroyed with several improvised explosive devices in July 2014. * Dair Mar Elia, the oldest monastery in Iraq, was demolished sometime between late August and September 2014. The destruction went unreported until January 2016. * The Al-Tahera Church, built in the early 20th century, was possibly blown up in early February 2015. However, there is no evidence that the church was actually destroyed. * St Markourkas Church, a 10th-century Chaldean Catholic church, was destroyed on 9 March 2015, according to the Iraqi government official Dureid Hikmat Tobia. A nearby cemetery was also bulldozed. * Another church, which was reportedly \\"thousands of years\\" old, was blown up in July 2015. According to Kurdish sources, four children were inadvertently killed when the church was destroyed. * The Sa'a Qadima Church, which was built in 1872, was blown up in April 2016. The Sa'a Qadima Church in Mosul, blown up in April 2016 ISIL also blew up or demolished a number of other churches elsewhere in Iraq or in Syria. The Armenian Genocide Memorial Church in Deir ez-Zor, Syria was blown up by ISIL militants on 21 September 2014. On 24 September 2014 ISIL militants destroyed with improvised explosive devices the 7th-century Green Church (also known as St Ahoadamah Church) belonging to the Assyrian Church of the East in Tikrit. The Mar Behnam Monastery in Khidr Ilyas near Bakhdida, Iraq was destroyed by ISIL in March 2015. , ISIL destroyed the Assyrian Christian Virgin Mary Church on Easter Sunday in the Syrian town of Tel Nasri. \\"As the 'joint forces' of Kurdish People's Protection Units and local Assyrian fighters attempted to enter the town\\", ISIL set off the explosives destroying what remained of the church. ISIL had controlled the church since 7 March 2015. On 21 August 2015, the historic Monastery of St. Elian near Al-Qaryatayn in the Homs Governorate was destroyed by ISIL. =Ancient and medieval sites= The Tal Afar Citadel, which was partially destroyed in December 2014 In May 2014, ISIL members smashed a 3,000-year-old neo-Assyrian statue from Tel Ajaja. Later reports indicated that over 40% of the artifacts at Tel Ajaja (Saddikanni) were looted by ISIS.AFP, At ancient Syria site, IS discovers then destroys treasures, Aug. 7 2016, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCzc0uJElGs Parts of the Tal Afar Citadel were blown up by ISIL in December 2014, causing extensive damage. In January 2015, ISIL reportedly destroyed large parts of the Nineveh Wall in al-Tahrir neighborhood of Mosul. Further parts of the walls, including the Mashka and Adad Gate, were blown up in April 2016. In the Syrian city of Raqqa, ISIL publicly ordered the bulldozing of a colossal ancient Assyrian gateway lion sculpture from the 8th century BC. Another lion statue was also destroyed. Both statues originated from the Arslan Tash archaeological site. The destruction was published in the ISIL magazine, Dabiq. Among the lost statues are those of Mulla Uthman al-Mawsili, of a woman carrying an urn, and of Abu Tammam. On 26 February 2015, ISIL released a video showing the destruction of various ancient artifacts in the Mosul Museum. The affected artifacts originate from the Assyrian era and from the ancient city of Hatra. The video in particular shows the defacement of a granite lamassu statue from the right side of the Nergal Gate by a jackhammer. The statue remained buried until 1941 when heavy rains eroded the soil around the gate and exposed two statues on both sides. Several other defaced items in the museum were claimed to be copies, but this was later rebutted by Iraq's Minister of Culture, Adel Sharshab who said: \\"Mosul Museum had many ancient artifacts, big and small. None of them were transported to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad. Thus, all artifacts destroyed in Mosul are original except for four pieces that were made of gypsum\\". Palace of Ashurnasirpal II in Nimrud, pictured in 2007. ISIL bulldozed and destroyed the city in March 2015 On 5 March 2015, ISIL reportedly started the demolition of Nimrud, an Assyrian city from the 13th century BC. The local palace was bulldozed, while lamassu statues at the gates of the palace of Ashurnasirpal II were smashed. A video showing the destruction of Nimrud was released in April 2015. By the time the city was retaken by government forces, 90% of the excavated zone of Nimrud, including Ashurbanipal II's palace, the ziggurat, and its Lamassu statues had been completely destroyed. What remains of it has been reclaimed by nature, and the site has remained untouched by humans since 2017. On 7 March 2015, Kurdish sources reported that ISIL had begun the bulldozing of Hatra, which has been under threat of demolition after ISIL had occupied the adjacent area. The next day ISIL sacked Dur-Sharrukin, according to a Kurdish official from Mosul, Saeed Mamuzini. The Iraqi Tourism and Antiquities Ministry launched the related investigation on the same day. On 8 April 2015, the Iraqi Ministry of Tourism reported that ISIL destroyed the remnants of the 12th-century Bash Tapia Castle in Mosul. As of early July 2015, 20% of Iraq's 10,000 archaeological sites has been under ISIL control. In 2015 the face of the Winged Bull of Nineveh was damaged. Palmyra Temple of Bel in Palmyra, which was blown up by ISIL in August 2015 Following the capture of Palmyra in Syria, ISIL was reported as not intending to demolish the city's World Heritage Site (while still intending to destroy any statues deemed 'polytheistic'). On 27 May 2015, ISIL released an 87-second video showing parts of the apparently undamaged ancient colonnades, the Temple of Bel and the Roman theatre. On 27 June 2015, however, ISIL demolished the ancient Lion of Al-lƒÅt statue in Palmyra. (It has since been restored, and is in storage in a Damascus museum until it can be determined that the statue can be safely returned to Palmyra.) Several other statues from Palmyra reportedly confiscated from a smuggler were also destroyed by ISIL. On 23 August 2015, it was reported that ISIL had blown up the 1st-century Temple of Baalshamin.Palmyra's Baalshamin temple 'blown up by IS' , BBCIsis 'blows up temple dating back to 17AD' in Syrian city of Palmyra , TheGuardian.com; accessed 25 August 2015. On 30 August 2015, ISIL demolished the Temple of Bel with explosives. Satellite imagery of the site taken shortly after showed almost nothing remained. According to the report issued on September 3, 2015 by ASOR Syrian Heritage initiative, ISIL also destroyed seven ancient tower tombs in Palmyra since the end of June over two phases. The last phase of destruction occurred between August 27 and September 2, 2015, including the destruction of the 2nd-century AD Tower of Elahbel, called \\"the most prominent example of Palmyra's distinct funerary monuments\\". Earlier, the ancient tombs of Iamliku and Atenaten were also destroyed. The Monumental Arch was also blown up in October. When Palmyra was recaptured by Syrian government forces in March 2016, retreating ISIL fighters blew up parts of the 13th-century Palmyra Castle, causing extensive damage. ISIL has also looted and demolished the Parthian/Roman city of Dura-Europos in east of Syria. Nicknamed \\"the Pompeii of the desert\\", the city was of particular archaeological significance. It was reported on 1 January 2019 that Syrian authorities recovered two Roman-era funerary busts smuggled from Palmyra from an abandoned ISIL site in the Al-Sukhnah countryside. Hatra Hatra () was an ancient city in the Ninawa Governorate and al-Jazira region of Iraq. A large fortified city and capital of the first Arab Kingdom, Hatra withstood invasions by the Romans in A.D. 116 and 198 thanks to its high, thick walls reinforced by towers. However about 240 ce, the city fell to ShƒÅp≈´r I (reigned c. 240‚Äì272), the ruler of the Persian SƒÅsƒÅnian dynasty, and was destroyed. The remains of the city, especially the temples where Hellenistic and Roman architecture blend with Eastern decorative features, attest to the greatness of its civilization. The city lies 290 km (180 mi) northwest of Baghdad and 110 km (68 mi) southwest of Mosul. On 7 March 2015, various sources including Iraqi officials reported that the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) had begun demolishing the ruins of Hatra. Video released by ISIL the next month showed destruction of the monuments. The ancient city was recaptured by the Popular Mobilization Forces on 26 April 2017. Though most of Hatra's temples were relatively unharmed, their interior scriptures and art had been smashed and looted by ISIS forces. =Libraries= ISIL has burned or stolen collections of books and papers from various locations, including the Central Library of Mosul (which they rigged with explosives and burned down), the library at the University of Mosul, a Sunni Muslim library, a 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers, and the Mosul Museum Library. Some destroyed or stolen works date back to 5000 BC and include \\"Iraq newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire, and book collections contributed by about 100 of Mosul‚Äôs establishment families.\\" The stated goal is to destroy all non-Islamic books. Response On 22 September 2014, the United States Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the Department of State had partnered with the American Schools of Orient Research Cultural Heritage Initiatives to \\"comprehensively document the condition of, and threats to, cultural heritage sites in Iraq and Syria to assess their future restoration, preservation, and protection needs\\". In 2014, the UNESCO's Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict condemned at the Ninth Meeting \\"repeated and deliberate attacks against cultural property... in particular in the Syrian Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq\\". UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova called the destructions in Mosul a violation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2199, and the destruction of Nimrud a war crime. Former Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki reported that the local parliamentary tourism and antiquities committee had \\"filed complaints with the UN to condemn all ISIL crimes and abuses, including those that affect ancient places of worship\\". On 28 May 2015, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously passed a resolution, initiated by Germany and Iraq and sponsored by 91 UN member states, stating that ISIL's destruction of cultural heritage may amount to a war crime and urging international measures to halt such acts, which it described as a \\"tactic of war\\".Resolution 69/281, un.org; accessed 15 August 2015. After the Palmyra temple's destruction in August 2015, the Institute for Digital Archaeology (IDA) announced plans to establish a digital record of historical sites and artifacts threatened by ISIL advance. To accomplish this goal, the IDA, in collaboration with UNESCO, will deploy 5,000 3D cameras to partners in the Middle East. The cameras will be used to capture 3D scans of local ruins and relics. The general director of the Czech National Museum, Michal Luke≈°, signed an agreement in June 2017 committing the institution to help Syria save, preserve and conserve much of its cultural and historical heritage damaged by war, including the ancient site of Palmyra; he met with Maamoun Abdulkarim and discussed plans for the works that are said to last until 2019. In June 2017, The World Monuments Fund (WMF) announced launching a ¬£500,000 scheme to train Syrian refugees near the Syrian-Jordanian border in traditional stone masonry. The aim is teaching them to develop skills necessary to be able to help in restoring cultural heritage sites that have been damaged or destroyed during the Syrian Civil War once peace is restored to Syria. Minor restorations have already begun: Palmyrene funerary busts of a deceased man and a woman, damaged and defaced by ISIL, were taken from Palmyra, then to Beirut to be sent off to Rome. Italian experts restored the portraits using 3D technology to print resin prosthetics, which were coated with a thick layer of stone dust to blend in with the original stone; the prosthetics were attached to the damaged faces of the busts using strong magnets. The restored pieces are now back in Syria.

In September 2019, Haworth resigned as Labour Party President in response to criticism over his handling of allegations of bullying, harassment, and sexual assault against a male Labour Party staffer. His resignation followed an allegation by a female Labour Party volunteer that she had been violently sexually assaulted by the male staffer. In December 2019, an independent review into the allegations of sexual assault, undertaken by Maria Dew QC on behalf of the Labour Party, found no sexual assaults nor instances of sexual harassment could be established. The Dew investigation cast major doubt over the allegations made by the principal complainant, who was also found to have been in a personal relationship with the respondent. Ms Dew concluded that the New Zealand Labour Party Code of Conduct and Harassment policies did not govern their personal relationship.

The film follows Marie Allen, an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather, who sees a large doll in the window of the shop. At night, she sneaks out to visit the shop with the doll, but finds it gone. She sneaks into the shop and ends up hiding in the box, to prevent from being discovered by the store clerk. She is taken to the home of the rich little girl, Daisy. After taking the doll's clothes, Marie hides in the box as Daisy approaches. When Daisy opens the box, Marie acts like a doll. When Daisy takes a break for food, Marie secretly takes the food and drink much to Daisy's bewilderment. Marie's grandfather arrives at the home and explains the situation and Marie receives the doll from the family. Little is known about the production or cast of the film, but Marie Eline played the role of Marie. The film was released on October 14, 1910 and was met with some praise in trade publications. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 15, 1910. It states: \\"Little Marie Allen, a penniless orphan, lives with her granddad. Out for a walk she admires a huge doll in a shop window. That night, after her granddad has fallen asleep, she slips out to have another look at the doll. Arriving at the toy shop, she sees that the doll is gone. Unseen by anyone, she enters the store. She finds the wonderful doll and lifts it out of its box to admire it. Hearing a clerk approaching, she becomes frightened and gets into the doll box. The doll rolls under the counter. The clerk sends the errand boy off with the box, thinking it contains the doll, which has been ordered for Daisy Smythe, a rich little girl. Arriving at Daisy's house, Marie steps out of the box as soon as the room is empty. She removes the doll clothes from the box and admires them greatly. She decides to try them on, and soon a little cap, shoes and garments are on her figure. Then she hears Daisy coming and retreats to the box. Daisy enters and takes the supposed doll from the box, falls in love with it instantly and enthusiastically works its arms and limbs. Marie lives up to her role well, imitating with stiff, jerky movements of the limbs that belong to real dolls. Then Daisy eats, and Marie grows hungry as she watches. When Daisy sets down her bowl of milk, Marie reaches over and drinks it down. Daisy is amazed when she misses the milk. Marie helps herself to all the food and Daisy's wonderment is amusing to see. Finally Daisy falls asleep in her chair and Marie falls asleep on the floor. Here she is found by her granddad, who managed to trace her from the toy shop, and Daisy and her mother laugh so heartily over Marie's adventure that they reward her cleverness with - the doll itself!\\"  Cast  *Marie Eline as Marie Allen The roles of Daisy Smythe and the grandfather were likely played by members of the Thanhouser Company, but the roles were uncredited and apparently not given in trade publications.  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The role of Marie was played by Marie Eline, but the other cast credits are unknown. Many 1910 Thanhouser productions have fragmentary cast credits. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.  Release and reception  The single reel comedy, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on October 14, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with known theaters in North Carolina, Washington, Montana, Arizona, Kansas, and Minnesota. The film was also shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The review received barely a sentence from Walton of The Moving Picture News who stated it was: \\"Good from A to Z.\\" The Moving Picture World offers little more, highlighting that the film would please children and offered a brief summary devoid of criticism or praise. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave a much more substantial treatment of the subject and stated, \\"This film, intended for juvenile patrons, has yet a charm for older spectators as well, because it tells a pretty story in a pretty way. ... The narrative is frankly impossible in plot, but that makes it no less entertaining to the youthful. A little make-believe is relished by the best of men. The acting of the wee heroine is really wonderful; it is spontaneous, lively, resourceful, graceful, and charming. The part of the rich girl, however, although it is capitally played, should have been entrusted to a smaller, if not to a younger, woman. The size of the actress makes the film look bizarre. The scenery is not all that might be desired, still it is passable.\\" The effect and usage of a living doll would be attempted again with The Spoiled Darling's Doll, apparently with better success than Delightful Dolly.

Video Data Bank, n.d. Web. 26 April 2015. \\"You are the product of t.v.\\" it declares, \\"you are delivered to the advertiser who is the customer. He consumes you\\". The text asserts that the corporations behind television broadcasting are manipulative forces working to maintain the status quo, from which they gain power and profit from. The text goes on to delve into how the public viewer is shaped and formed by corporations and television. It describes the manipulative control and the motivations of the advertisers and corporations that become ingrained in television. The analysis of political and ideological functioning of television directly confronts the viewer of this piece. The film \\"goes further than simply critiquing broadcast television, extending its scope to target the role of television networks and beyond to the large corporations that control them and the political state they represent\\". By using the medium that Schoolman and Serra are inherently critiquing, by \\"using television, in effect, against itself‚Äî(they) employ a characteristic strategy of early, counter-corporate video collectives‚Äîa strategy that remains integral to video artists committed to a critical dismantling of the media's political and ideological stranglehold\\". The video tears apart the masquerade of commercial television, revealing television as \\"little more than an insidious sponsor for the corporate engines of the world\\". The use of minimalistic technology and its stark appearance of this short video works to \\"strip away any pretense of 'entertainment' or even news or documentary, opting for a direct appeal to the mind and emotions of the viewer... The work is effective not simply because of the message conveyed via the text, which through coherent persuasive argument outlines the relationship between television entertainment, news and information, the maintaining of the status-quo and corporate and political control, but also of the direct televisual power of its form\\".

Satterwhite created 230 3D modeled versions of his body, animated figures, and his mother's drawings. Animating all of these elements, he performs in a digital \\"utopian and non-political space\\", combining his public reactions to art history, political histories, and pop culture with his mother's private drawings and inventions. Background and concept Satterwhite's mother was schizophrenic and stayed home, unemployed, up until his teenage years. As a productive form of therapy, she drew pencil-on-paper drawings and diagrams that explained and envisioned potential product ideas after being inspired by late-night television infomercials. To her, the drawings would allow for a future promise of financial security if they were able to be projected out into the public before becoming products. Satterwhite uses these drawings, along with the scrawled-out text accompanying them that describe the products' purposes, and turns them into three-dimensional objects for his video series. Using Autodesk Maya, a 3D-rendering program, the images are digitally traced by hand using a stylus to be then placed into a larger virtual landscape. Satterwhite pairs these drawings with other photographs, family videos, and his own pieces of dance and performance. The culmination of these elements is intended as an exploration of memory, personal history, surrealism, narrative, psychology, and reality. =Digital avatar= Satterwhite's digital avatar performs dance movements in the films' digitally created utopian realm, combining live action with digital creation. He combines elements of choreographer William Forsythe's dance techniques with elements of martial arts and, most importantly, voguing.

His mother's images are connected with his own body, art historical references, digitally rendered bodies, and fantastical structures. The special awareness of the physical realm existing between bodies and objects are reimagined and transformed, along with the world of images, and the shifting relationships between them.

Training and dance career Lopukhov was born into a family of dancers, which included his brother, Andrei, and his two sisters, Evgenia and the renowned Lydia Lopokova. Lydia was a dancer for Sergei Diaghilev and married John Maynard Keynes. Lopukhov graduated from the Saint Petersburg Theatre School in 1905 and began his career at the Mariinsky Theatre. He also toured with the Bolshoi in their 1910‚Äì11 season. Choreography Following the Revolution of 1917, a period of experimentation in ballet ensued as a distaste for works which evoked the imperial court developed in post-revolutionary Russia. To re-appeal to the public, choreographers in Soviet Russia explored new performance spaces and formed smaller chamber ballet companies where there would be more scope for creativity. Among those experimental choreographers was Fyodor Lopukhov. Lopukhov considered the relationship between music and dance, suggesting that choreographers should be able to analyze the score of their ballet as to better portray the nuances of the score in terms of instrumentation, rhythm, color, and dynamics. His goal was to create ballets from a musical as opposed to a dramatic perspective ‚Äì he published his ideas in his book Paths of a Balletmaster in 1925. Lopukhov was appointed the artistic director of the Leningrad State Theatre of Opera and Ballet (Kirov) in 1922 and quickly began to override the work done by Marius Petipa by creating plotless ballets ‚Äì the first, and best known, being The Magnificence of the Universe (1923), a \\"dance symphony\\" done to Beethoven's fourth symphony. Unlike the Petipa classics, The Magnificence did not tell any story, but symbolically suggested the origin of universal light and other profound spiritual concepts. The choreography was characterized by a mixture of academic ballet technique and acrobatic lifts that would later become synonymous with The Soviet style of ballet ‚Äì his cast included George Balanchine who would later introduce similar processes and concepts to the American dance scene. The Magnificence, after a positive rehearsal review by contemporaries, was received negatively on its debut and Lopukhov did not attempt any further dance symphonies. Lopukhov also created the Soviet political ballet focusing on the concept of a cleansing whirlwind titled Red Whirlwind (1924). This ballet, the first to tackle the subject of the 1917 Revolution, begins with an act or ‚Äúprocess‚Äù with strong, aggressive dancers opposing the passive and elusive group. The second ‚Äúprocess‚Äù depicts dissatisfied citizens with robbers and drunks who are defeated by the working class. Some other ballets choreographed by Lopukhov in an effort to find a new means of expression include Night on Bald Mountain, with music by Mussorgsky (1924), Pulcinella (1926) and The Fox (1927), both with music by Stravinsky. His attempts to evolve the principles of classical dance were displayed in the acrobatic movements and character dances closely resembling the original ethnic dances they sprung forth from. This was apparent in his ballet The Ice Maiden, with music by Grieg (1927), which was one of his longest running ballets, being staged until 1936. He also choreographed The Bolt in 1931 and choreographed and co-wrote the libretto for The Limpid Stream in 1935, both with music by Shostakovich. Following a negative editorial of The Limpid Stream in the Pravda in early February 1936, which resulted in Lopukhov's co- librettist Adrian Piotrovsky being sent to a gulag, Lopukhov was stripped of his directorship and his choreographic career was effectively ended. Lopukhov assembled courses for choreographers from 1937-1941 at the Leningrad Choreographic School. He was artistic director of the choreographic section in the stage directing department at the Leningrad Conservatory starting in 1962. Lopukhov‚Äôs other choreographed ballets include The Firebird (1921), Raymonda (1922), The Sleeping Beauty (1923), Don Quixote (1923), Khovanshchina (1926), The Red Poppy (1929), Copp√©lia (1934), The Snow Maiden (1947), and Pictures at an Exhibition (1963).

Roger Morris), and Margaret, who died intestate. Margaret's portion was, by terms of her father's will, equally divided among her brother and sisters, and in 1751, after a survey of the whole tract, it was geographically divided into nine Lots; three on the river; three in the interior; three on the eastern (Connecticut) border. Each of the three heirs inherited a lot in each division.Pelletreau, William, S, History of Putnam County, New York - With Biographical Sketches of its Prominent Men, W.W. Preston & Company, Philadelphia, 1886 During the American Revolution the Philipse Patent lands were confiscated by the Provisional New York government's Commissioners of Forfeiture.Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture Sold afterwards, they became today's Putnam County. Philipse Patent The Hudson Highlands are among the scenic highlilghts of the Philipse Patent In 1697 Philipse purchased a tract of land from Dutch traders Lambert Dortlandt and Jan Sybrandt, who had bought it a few years before from several Wiccopee chiefs.Putnam County Historical Society Adolphus Philipse profile This became known as the Highland Patent, and extended approximately 13 miles along the east shore of the Hudson River, from Annsville Creek to the Fish Kill, and eastward some 20 or so miles to the border of the Colony of Connecticut, including Pollopel Island in the Hudson.Smith, Philip Henry, General History of Putnam County: From 1609 to 1876, inclusive, published by the author, Pawling, NY, 1877, p. 44 Shortly after purchasing it, Philipse, whose residence was the Philipse Manor Hall near Tarrytown, and who maintained only a bachelor shooting lodge on Lake Mahopac in the Highland Patent, opened the tract to tenant settlers. Thus began a policy that lasted throughout his lifetime and his heirs' so long as they owned the land, to rent rather than sell, a practice which led to stunted growth for two and a half centuries to come. After Philipse's death in 1750 (Smith, 1749), the Highland Patent was inherited by his nephew, Frederick Philipse II, his only heir-at-law, who became the second Lord of the Manor at Philipsborough in Westchester County.  Family  Philipsburg Manor Adolphus Philipse was the second son of Frederick Philipse, the first lord of Philipsburg Manor, and Margaret Hardenbroeck. He was a younger brother of Philip Philipse.Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site website: Philip Philipse, oldest son of Frederick Philipse I, and his wife, Mary, both died in Barbados in 1689 (on September 14 and October 18, respectively).

She has also published a number of books. Early life and education Braudy grew up in Philadelphia and relocated to Manhattan, New York, and attended University of Pennsylvania and Yale University graduate schools where she studied ethics and aesthetics.Jean-Paul Sartre Essays in Aesthetics Open Road Media, January 12, 2012 Between college and graduate school Braudy worked for the New York ACLU. Braudy's father worked for the Philadelphia Housing Authority and actively supported local artists such as Dox Thrash. Bernard Orr was Vice President of the American Jewish Committee. His Master's thesis at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania became the book Technological Unemployment, an early look at how advances in technology were replacing human labor. He was the principal of a vocational night school whose students were largely African-American. He also wanted to be a writer and Braudy believes this may be the reason she became a writer. Braudy's mother Blanche Orr taught history at Germantown High School, whose students were also largely African-American, and went back to school to become a reading supervisor because her students needed better reading skills. Braudy now lives with film editor Joe Weintraub. Career Besides her six acclaimed books, Braudy has written for The New York Times, Newsweek, The Atlantic Monthly, The Huffington Post, Harper's Magazine, Glamour, Vanity Fair, Ms., New York Magazine, The New Journal, Jezebel and The Week. She was the first woman writer hired by Newsweek where talented women had been previously relegated to jobs as fact-checkers, researchers and secretaries. She was one of the first editors of the student/faculty magazine The New Journal at Yale and is currently a member of the magazine's advisory board. Her cover story on Joseph Heller elicited a letter to the editor from him, \\"I found the article by Susan Braudy one of the most interesting and thorough I've ever read about anyone especially me.\\" Braudy believes Heller's praise was her ticket to writing for mainstream outlets such as The New York Times magazine and New York Magazine. Braudy has taught writing at Brooklyn College. She also judged the Lukas Prize in 2006, the award from the Columbia University Journalism School and the Nieman Foundation at Harvard given annually to recognize excellence in book-length investigative journalism. Braudy was an editor and writer at Ms. magazine where she edited the October 1975 men's issue whose cover featured Robert Redford's back. The issue included a \\"tour de force\\" piece by Harold Brodkey and is the magazine's highest-selling. In 1977, Braudy became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. In 1981, Braudy was appointed Vice President of East Coast Production at Warner Brothers where she championed Oliver Stone's movie Platoon. She also worked as Vice President of Michael Douglas's Stonebridge Production Company for three years from 1986-1989TCM Archive Materials, \\"Susan Braudy\\", No date, Accessed 10 March 2015 where she tried to convince Douglas to make the film The Hurricane, the story of Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, and a docudrama about Martin Luther King Jr. She was hired by Francis Ford Coppola, Jerry Bruckheimer, Martin Scorsese, and Oliver Stone to write screenplays.\\"Susan Braudy\\" \\"Who's Who In America\\", No date, Accessed 10 March 2015 Her in-depth piece on paperback auctions, published in The New York Times magazine,Susan Braudy, \\"Paperback Auction: What Price a 'Hot' Book?; Star Properties\\" The New York Times, 21 May 1978 was used by the Federal Trade Commission to institute and win an anti-trust suit against the high-bidder in a multimillion-dollar paperback rights auction.Robert J.

She counts as her mentors Margaret Mead, whose class she audited at Columbia and who demonstrated by example what a bright woman on her own could be; Gloria Steinem, who encouraged her to express her female voice; Daniel Yergin, who taught her the value of infinite research; Michael Douglas, who taught her that glamour isn't glamorous; Michael Wolff, who taught her the music of the New York hustle; Marshall Brickman, who taught her about heartbreak on the fast track; and Woody Allen, who taught her his artistic credo, \\"Turn pain into cash.\\" Braudy's January 2013 letter to the editors of The New York Times Book Review critiquing their policy of not allowing colleagues to review each other's books was influential. It convinced the institution to change its policy. The letter argued that like-minded people tend to know each other. Braudy states that eliminating them as reviewers had historically skewed reviews against authors. Braudy's most recently published works include two articles for the website Jezebel, \\"Up Against the Centerfold\\" (March 2016, receiving over 150,000 reads) and \\"'Sisters in Misery': What It Was Like to Interview Joan Didion at Home in 1977\\" (March 2017) and one article for The Week in April 2016, \\"A Feminist Among the Centerfolds\\".  Accusations against Michael Douglas  On January 18, 2018, Braudy accused former colleague Michael Douglas of sexual harassment in an article for The Hollywood Reporter. She contended that during her time at Stonebridge Productions, she was \\"subjected to sexual harassment by Douglas that included near-constant profane and sexually charged dialogue, demeaning comments about her appearance, graphic discussions regarding his mistresses,\\" and finally masturbating in front of her. Douglas had published a preemptive denial of the claims in The Hollywood Star ten days earlier, saying he \\"felt the need to get ahead\\" and explain his concerns about the validity of the story. He stated: \\"I don't have skeletons in my closet, or anyone else who's coming out or saying this. I'm bewildered why, after 32 years, this is coming out, now.\\" In popular culture Braudy had been commissioned by Playboy magazine in 1969 to write an \\"objective\\" piece on the feminism movement. Her final article was viewed as controversial by male Playboy editors. The debate continued up to Hugh Hefner; who wrote in a memo (covertly distributed by female Playboy employees) that he felt the article needed to focus more on the \\"highly irrational, emotional, kookie trend\\" of feminism because \\"these chicks [are] the natural enemy of Playboy.\\" He argued that radical feminists were rejecting the Playboy way of life.Watts Braudy was reportedly brought to tears by the harsh reaction from the Playboy team to her piece and eventually withdrew her work. She later wrote an article published in Defiance and Glamour magazine in which she analyzed the contents of Hefner's memo and criticized his approach to women. Braudy's later reflection on the Playboy incident for Jezebel, \\"Up Against the Centerfold: What It Was Like to Report on Feminism for Playboy in 1969,\\" was referenced by Pulitzer Prize-winning The New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum on her Twitter as an \\"amaaaaaazing,\\" \\"must-read\\" piece.\\"The true must-read about Hef is this amaaaaaazing piece by @SbraudyOrr...\\", Twitter.com, September 28th, 2017 After writing an article for The New York TimesSusan Braudy, \\"He's Woody Allen's Not-So-Silent Partner\\", The New York Times, August 21st, 1977 about Woody Allen and his writing partner Marshall Brickman she was used as the muse for Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep's characters in Manhattan.Sheila Weller, Girls Like Us, April 8th 2008 Her jokes about the surreal twist were quoted on the New York Post gossip column \\"Page Six,\\" as well as in People Magazine.

New York: Sony Music Entertainment RGM-0083. The time of this transition was already a busy one: \\"During that same time I was working non-stop at different nightclubs around Manhattan... sometimes four or five performances a night at the Copacabana, The Blue Angel, Basin Street East. I was doing all this singing at night and then signed to record in the daytime. So a lot of the work I did at Mercury was done under a lot of duress.\\" Because Mathis was used to the mentors he'd always had while recording at Columbia, his new position of power was a bit of a shock. \\"Now, all of a sudden, I was in charge of my own decisions in the studio, and I didn't have someone to guide me on what I was doing, right or wrong.\\"(2014) The Complete Global Albums Collection by Johnny Mathis [CD booklet]. New York: Sony Music Entertainment 88843091432. Although Don Costa was at the helm of his first Mercury LP, Sounds of Christmas, Mathis took on the role of producer for the next several albums. \\"But I wasn't a producer, and I didn't really realize until then how important producers were and how much they assisted me in my work.\\" After his Mercury contract expired and he returned to Columbia (bringing the Global material with him), Mathis had a much clearer sense of what he had been missing during his time away. \\"I needed someone to listen and suggest alternatives as far as my note selections were concerned... a producer who listens to you and says, 'I like what you're doing, but I hate that last note you made.

It was purchased in 1697 by Adolphus Philipse, a wealthy landowner of Dutch descent in the Province of New York, and in time became today's Putnam County. Philipse bought the roughly tract from two Dutch traders who had purchased it from \\"Wiccopee chiefs\\" of the Wappinger native American people. Originally known as the Highland Patent, it spanned from the Hudson to the then Connecticut Colony along today's northern Westchester County border. In 1731 it was incorporated into Dutchess County, and divided in 1754 among three heirs, but remained in the Loyalists Philipse family until seized in 1779 during the Revolution. The Commissioners of Forfeiture of the Revolutionary colony of New York auctioned it in parcels, without compensation to its prior owners. In spite of a provision requiring it in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, restitution never was made. In 1812, the southern part of Dutchess County, including all of what had been the Phillipse Patent, was spun off into a new county, Putnam County. History Adolphus Philipse (1665-1749), son of Frederick, first Lord of the Manor of Philipsborough =Purchase= The first step to establishing rights to real estate at the time was usually to apply to the colonial government for a license to purchase a tract of land from local Native American inhabitants. Natives typically had notions of communal sharing of land resources and did not understand that by such sales the buyers intended to acquire the right to exclude the native sellers from all access to the land. On December 2, 1680, Dutch traders Lambert Dorlandt and Jan Sybrant (Seberinge) applied to the New York Colonial government for such a license and on July 15, 1691 \\"purchased\\" a large tract of land that embraced much of what is today Western Putnam county from local Native Americans, including Wiccopee chiefs. Dortlandt and Sybrant did not then themselves obtain the land patent from the governor but in 1697 sold their rights to the land to Adolphus Philipse, a wealthy merchant.William Pelletreau, \\"History of Putnam County,\\" (Interlaken, New York: Heart of the Lakes Publishing, 1975), pp. 10-12 Adolphus was the second son of Frederick Philipse, the first Lord of the Manor of Philipsborough, a Dutch immigrant to North America of Bohemian heritage who had risen to become one of the greatest landholders in New Netherland.Historical and Genealogical Record Dutchess and Putnam Counties New York, Press of the A. V. Haight Co., Poughkeepsie, New York, 1912; pp. 62-79 \\"Adolph Philipse having thus acquired the title from the original owners, proceeded at once to take the necessary steps for obtaining a patent for his lands, and presented a petition to Benjamin Fletcher, who was then governor of the Province of New York, which was granted June 17, 1697. While the Indian deed to Dorlandt and Sebring and the subsequent transfers only conveyed the land extending back from the Hudson River to a marked tree on the line of the Rombout Patent, or \\"Land of Cortlandt and Company,\\" the patent of Governor Fletcher conveyed all the land between the river and the boundary line between New York and Connecticut. To confirm his title to this additional tract Adolph Philipse obtained a new Indian deed in 1702.\\" and extended approximately 13 miles along the east shore of the Hudson River, from Annsville Creek to the Fish Kill, and eastward some 20 or so miles to the border of the Colony of Connecticut, including Pollopel Island in the Hudson.Philipse Family Adolphus Philipse, (The Patent) Smith, Philip Henry, General History of Putnam County: From 1609 to 1876, inclusive, published by the author, Pawling, NY, 1877, p. 44 Shortly after purchasing it, Philipse, whose residence was the Philipse Manor Hall near Tarrytown, and who maintained only a bachelor shooting lodge on Lake Mahopac in the Highland Patent, opened the tract to tenant settlers. Thus began a policy that lasted throughout his lifetime and his heirs' so long as they owned the land, to rent rather than sell, a practice which led to stunted growth for two and a half centuries to come. Map of Philipsburg Manor with current borders overlaid on the property A surveying error during the establishment of the border between the provinces of New York and the Connecticut Colony resulted in a portion of a disputed tract known as The Oblong spanning the entire eastern border of the Patent. The proper boundaries were not resolved until a land swap between the then U.S. states late in the 18th century. =Inheritance= Upon Frederick's death in 1702, Adolphus inherited a partial share of the Manor's lands, which then amounted to over 80 square miles and encompassed the bulk of today's lower Westchester County. The title and balance of the lands passed to his nephew, Frederick Philipse II, whose father Philip, elder brother of Adolphus, had predeceased Frederick I. =Division= Adolphus Philipse died in 1750 (Smith, 1749), with his share of the Manor and the Highland Patent he had acquired on his own passing to Frederick II, his only heir-at-law. Upon Frederick II's death in 1751, the Manor went to his son Frederick Philipse III, while the Patent was divided among four of Frederick II's offspring: son Philip, and daughters, Susannah (wife of Beverley Robinson), Mary (wife of Col. Roger Morris), and Margaret, who died intestate. By terms of her father's will Margaret's portion was then equally divided among her brother and sisters. Based upon a 1751 survey, the tract was geographically divided on the 7th of Feb 1754 into nine Lots as seen in the preserved undated pen and ink map: three on the river, three in the interior, and three on the eastern border abutting the Oblong. Each of the three heirs inherited a lot in each division.Pelletreau, William, S, History of Putnam County, New York - With Biographical Sketches of its Prominent Men, W.W.

As such, he was attained by the Provincial Congress of New York in 1779 and his Manor and other lands in today's Westchester County were seized.Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture ‚ÄúAn Act for the forfeiture and sale of the estates of those who have adhered to the enemies of this state‚Äù was passed by the Provincial Congress on October 22, 1779. The law seized the land of fifty-nine loyalists, and, if they were found guilty of loyalism, banished them from the State of New York upon penalty of ‚Äúdeath without benefit of Clergy.‚Äù(5) Among those attainted was Frederick Philipse, owner of the Manor of Philipsburg, the largest tract of land in Westchester County.(6) Also on October 22, 1779, writes historian Vivienne L. Ratner, ‚Äúthe Governor was authorized to appoint Commissioners of Forfeitures to dispose of the confiscated estates,‚Äù with tenant farmers, ‚Äúwho had leased‚Ä¶and improved the land,‚Äù given first priority to purchase their tracts.\\" Several months later their sale was ordered.Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture ‚ÄúA law passed on March 10, 1780, called for the immediate sale of portions of the forfeited lands to pay for apparel and provisions needed by the troops.(8) On March 18, 1780, the United States Congress passed an Act which mandated the issuance of new currency, backed by the credit of the states to which the bills were allotted. Each state was to pay off one-sixth of the bills annually. On June 15, 1780, the New York legislature reserved the larger of the forfeited estates, including that of Frederick Philipse, as collateral for the redemption of the bills issued by New York in pursuance of the act of Congress of March 18, 1780. The Commissioners of Forfeitures, however, were not permitted to sell any of the mortgaged lands until further instructions from the Provincial Congress.\\" John Jacob Astor purchased the rights to Mary Philipse's share of the Patent in 1809 Philipse family holdings belonging to other members, principally the Highland Patent, were also seized by the Commissioners of Forfeitures. Sale was withheld during the war, as its outcome was uncertain, confiscated lands had been pledged as collateral against monies borrowed by the provisional government to finance the conflict,Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"Sales of the estates set aside on June 15, 1780, and of other forfeited lands were authorized by the state legislature on October 7, 1780. The Governor was to appoint commissioners to sell forfeited lands for gold, silver, or Congressional bills of credit, in order to pay off one-sixth the bills issued in pursuance of the act of Congress of March 18, 1780. These early transactions were not conducted by the Commissioners of Forfeitures, but rather by ‚Äúcommissioners of specie‚Äù who bridged the gap between the Commissioners of Sequestration and the Commissioners of Forfeitures. The majority of the forfeited estates, however, were not disposed of until after the conclusion of the war.\\" and tenants lobbied for the right of preemptive purchase of leased land.Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"On March 31, 1781, the right of tenants to preemption of purchase of their farms was again affirmed and the procedure for such sales further described. An act of the Provincial Congress on April 14, 1782, mandated that none of the seized lands in the Southern District was to be sold 'until the further order of the legislature.'\\" The sale proceeded after the Revolution ended. In spite of assurances of restitution in the 1783 Treaty of Paris signed with the British, Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \\"'Article V of the peace treaty signed by Britain and the United States in Paris on September 3, 1783, insists on 'the restitution of all estates, rights, and properties, which have been confiscated belonging to real British subjects‚Äù and to noncombatant loyalists.

A combination of advantageous economic and geographic circumstances ensured that few Westchester County farmers had financial problems; many were well-to-do and some agricultural families were quite wealthy.(15) When tenant farmers could not afford or did not wish to purchase their lands, the tracts were sold to wealthy landowners, Revolutionary leaders, and businessmen from New York City.(16) Most of the buyers of confiscated estates were men. The only women to buy tracts of forfeited estates in the Southern District were either widows or administratrices of estates, or were pooling their resources with male family members to purchase a tract of land.\\" In all, the lands were divided up into almost 200 different parcels, with the bulk of the holdings going to Dutch New York businessman Henry Beekman. In 1787, a British court decided that the inheritance rights of heirs to property that was confiscated by the Americans during the American Revolution was recoverable. Under this decision, John Jacob Astor I purchased the reversionary rights to the Philipse lands in 1809 from the heirs of Roger Morris (husband of Mary Philipse) for ¬£20,000. After Mary Philipse Morris died in 1825, Astor attempted to collect rents on the lands, but the new ‚Äúowners,‚Äù who had purchased from the lands from the NY Commission of Forfeiture, refused to pay, and Astor tried to evict them. A compromise was reached in 1828 when NY State compensated Astor for the reversionary rights in the amount of $500,000.Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site website: French's Gazetteer of the State of New York (1860): \\"In 1809, John Jacob Astor bought the interest of the heirs of Morris for this property for f20,000\\" and brought suit against the State. \\"The State to protect those who held title from the Commissioners of Forfeiture, passed a law, April 16, 1827, directing 5 suits to be prosecuted to judgment in the Circuit Court of New York for review and final decision. If against the defendants, the State agreed to pay $450,000 in 5 per cent stock, redeemable at pleasure; and if the decision included improvements that had been made by occupants, $250,000 more. Three suits were tried, each resulting in favor of Astor; upon which the comptroller was, by act of April 5, 1832, directed to issue stock for the full amount, with costs. The amount issued was $561,500. Few suits have been tried in the State involving larger interests to greater numbers, or which were argued with more ability, than this.\\" =Incorporation= The Highland Patent had been incorporated into Dutchess County in 1737,Seven Hills Lake history: \\"In 1737, the Colonial Assembly designated the Philipse Patent as the South Precinct of Dutchess County, and the Philipses began leasing farms to immigrants from Massachusetts, Connecticut, Long Island and lower Westchester.\\" where it was known as the \\"South Precinct.\\" In 1806 a very small portion north of the Hudson Highlands by the mouth of Fishkill Creek was split off from Philipstown (which had been established in 1788 out of the westernmost three and part of a fourth parcel of the Philipse Patent) and given to the Town of Fishkill.Putnam County Online: Boundary Changes In 1812 the balance of the Philipse Patent was separated from Dutchess County and became today's Putnam County.

He served as Associate Editor of the Society from 1905 to 1922, Vice President from 1922 to 1954, and President from 1954 to 1957, before retiring at the age of 77.Bryan, C.D.B. (1988). The National Geographic Society: 100 Years of Adventure and Discovery. Pgs. 298‚Äì301, 304‚Äì305. . Early life John Oliver La Gorce was born on September 22, 1880 (some sources say 1879) in Scranton, Pennsylvania. As a youngster, he became very interested in the Morse code which his mother had taught him, and he went to the US Capitol to practice telegraphy. However, his biggest interest was in exploring and geography, and he was hired in 1905 by Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor, the third president of the Society and who would become his close friend. He soon became popular in the Society, and in 1914 a special photo of him in his office was published in the Magazine.National Geographic, March, 1960, page 443. Career La Gorce remained in the Society for 54 years, from 1905 until his death in 1959. He was an avid photographer and went to locations all around the world, taking many amazing pictures including sailboats in Lisbon harbor, tuna and seabirds feeding on sardines, El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, and many more. He also write many articles for the Magazine. His biggest interest was perhaps in fishes, and in 1919 he participated in a hunt that brought in a 22-foot manta ray, the world's biggest to date. He also helped produce the world's first underwater photographs in 1926, and edited all versions of the National Geographic's The Book of Fishes.National Geographic, March, 1960, page 441. La Gorce was married to actress Betty Brice (they divorced in 1913), and had one child who he named after his friend, Gilbert Grosvenor La Gorce. His son died early in 1959, leaving La Gorce devastated. Nevertheless, he continued to work in the Society right up until his death in 1959. For less than three years, from May 1954 to January 1957, he had served as President of the Society, retiring mostly due to health problems. However, he was criticized for choosing not to change anything about the magazine (his successor, Melville Bell Grosvenor, son of Gilbert, changed the name of the Magazine to National Geographic in March 1960, which La Gorce chose never to do). La Gorce was so influential in his work for the Magazine and world travels that many landmarks are named after him. These include the La Gorce Mountains in Antarctica and the La Gorce Arch in Utah. In addition to National Geographic, he served as a US Delegate in the 1925 Pan American Scientific Congress. He was given the Henry Grier Bryant Medal in 1948 by the Geographic Society of Philadelphia for \\"outstanding service to geography.\\" Finally, in 1955, he was chosen by Columbia University as a leading journalist to receive the Maria Moors Cabot Award for promoting understanding among nations of the Americas.National Geographic, March, 1960, page 440.

Gameplay The Blockheads is a 2.5D survival game. Players control an avatar dubbed a \\"Blockhead\\", which can explore their surroundings, navigate the sky in a search for floating islands, navigate the entire world map, harvest materials to create buildings, structures, or create farms and make crafting benches that enable the Blockhead to avail of advanced options in the game. Aggressive and non-aggressive creatures also exist on land, underground, and in bodies of water, including sharks, dodos, scorpions, dropbears, and fellow Blockheads. The game features a PvP (player versus player) option that enables players to attack one another in Multiplayer mode. Multiplayer can be accessed over WiFi internet, with worlds hosted over LAN, Game Center, or Cloud Servers. Cloud servers are indirectly created servers hosted by Linode. Since v1.7, servers will have to be paid for with In App Purchases. The game can also be hosted via an app for Mac users, although availability of the world solely depends on the online status of the host. The player can 'warp' a Blockhead through a portal, randomly generating a finite world of multiple sizes ranging from 1/16-16x that loops back to the portal. There is a choice between male or female, with various unique features such as different hairstyles,facial hair and shirt color. There are no differences aside from the randomly generated name and appearance(which can both be changed). The Blockhead has six statistics which can be accessed from the ingame mini-menu: Health, happiness, hunger, energy, and environment. The hunger and energy bar will constantly decrease, and the Blockhead must eat food to prevent the hunger bar from entirely depleting, which depletes the health bar. The energy bar, when depleted, will result in the Blockhead walking slowly and 'collapsing from exhaustion' (sleeping on the spot). This can be gradually filled by sleeping in a bed, on the ground, or can be filled instantly by consuming caffeinated items like coffee. The player must craft items to progress in the game. Crafting takes a certain amount of time, but this waiting process can be bypassed by using time crystals, which can be gained by watching short video ads, mining them in caves, or through in-app purchases. Players can also purchase double-time, a feature speeding up crafting times by twice the speed (hence the name, double-time). The player can choose to join online servers, and play with other players. They can be hosted in several ways. On an iOS device, the player can set up a Local Area Network LAN world. Game center can be used to play before iOS 10 since the application was disabled after that version. It has been confirmed that Game Center worlds will no longer be used as an option in v1.7. Due to a new update to the game, players can now create single player worlds or servers with custom options, such as custom health values, how the world is generated, custom sun colors, and even customizing the items blockheads spawn with. In the most recent updates, it has included a new gamemode called \\"expert mode.\\" The Blockheads contains in-app purchases including the aforementioned double- time and time crystals, which can be used to craft items and do actions faster in the game. HD graphics used to be paid and added in hand drawn icons and an interface. However, prior to the 1.7 update, it is now free but it can be turned off in settings. Reception Rickey Ainsworth of Toucharcade gives the game a rating of 5 stars, saying that it is another one of many two dimensional versions of Minecraft, although it features many twists and turns that make the game exciting. Metacritic, based on 5 reviews and 7 ratings, gives the game a 4/5 score.  Other  The Blockheads has an official website and a forum run on Discourse and previously vBulletin. Its community is large and widely approved by the community on both platforms. It has received over 10 million official downloads. It has been noted that the game has largely been overrun by script kiddies. A small portion of the playerbase has been overtaken by roleplay, online dating, and sexual content.

The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Cretan. She served in the Mediterranean. She was sold in 1814. Between 1815 and 1831 she made five voyages as a whaler. French brig Nettuno was launched in April 1807 with Eug√®ne de Beauharnais in attendance. She was at Venice in November, and Lesina and Ancona in May 1808. Capture Unite took shelter from a gale between 28 and 31 July under Lusin on the Dalmatian coast. Late in the afternoon of the 31st, near Premuda, she sighted three enemy naval brigs. Captain Campbell set out in chase and around 3am found himself with in two miles of two of the brigs. Suddenly he sighted he saw the third; Unite steered to pass by the third and while within pistol-shot, gave the brig a broadside, which caused the brig to surrender without a shot being fired, her crew having taken refuge below decks. Unite sent boats that secured the brig and then set out after her two companions. There was little wind so the brigs made use of their sweeps and it was only around 7a.m. that Unite was able to catch up with the larger, and more laggardly of the brigs. This vessel, seeing no chance to escape, fired a broadside, struck her colours, and ran onto the shore, where Unite took possession. The third brig escaped. The two captured brigs turned out to be Nettuno and Teuli√©, both of sixteen \\"Thirty-Two-Pounders, Brass Carronades\\", and 115 men each. The brigs had been sent to find and take Unite, the French having heard that she had so many men sick that she would be easy prey. Although Unite had no casualties, the two French brigs were less fortunate. Nettuno had seven men killed, two drowned, and 13 wounded; Teuli√® had five men killed and 16 wounded. HMS Cretan The Royal Navy commissioned Nettuno in the Mediterranean as Cretan, under Commander Charles F. Payne. He would remain her commander throughout her service. Between 13 July and 1 December 1809 Cretan was at Sheerness, undergoing repairs. Cretan participated in the unsuccessful Walcheren Campaign, a British expedition to the Netherlands in 1809 intended to open another front in the Austrian Empire's struggle with France during the War of the Fifth Coalition. Around 40,000 soldiers, 15,000 horses together with field artillery and two siege trains crossed the North Sea and landed at Walcheren on 30 July. This was the largest British expedition of that year, larger than the army serving in the Peninsular War in Portugal. The campaign involved little fighting, but heavy losses from the sickness popularly dubbed \\"Walcheren Fever\\". Over 4,000 British troops died (only 106 in combat) and the rest withdrew on 9 December 1809. During the withdrawal operations, Commodore G.W.C.R. Owen, who was in actual command, shifted his pennant to Cretan the better to oversee the operations. After the Walcharen Campaign Cretan served in the North Sea and Baltic. On 28 October 1810 Cretan captured the Danish privateer Neptune. Neptune was armed with five guns, had a crew of 24 men, and had left Schelling the day before; she had taken no prizes before Cretan captured her. Neptune arrived at Dover on 7 November.Lloyd's List, no. 4509, - accessed 27 February 2015. Cretan and shared in the proceeds of the capture, on 25 December 1811, of the Vrow Alida.

By agreement, Musquito shared the prize money with Desiree, Banterer and Cretan. On 17 September , , Desiree, , , and Cretan shared in the capture of the Dankbarheide. When the gun-brig Hearty detained the Prussian vessel Friede on 29 September, Indefatigable, Desiree, Primrose, Cretan, Drake, were either in company or sharing by agreement. Cretan captured two fishing boats, the Harmonie and the Stadt Embden on 16 January 1813.

For Cretans first whaling voyage, Captain Joseph Moore left London on 18 April 1815 for New South Wales. She reached Port Jackson on 7 September, having sailed around the bottom of Tasmania. She left Sydney on 12 October to commence whaling around New Zealand. In December 1816 she was off the west coast of South America. She returned to Britain on 5 May 1817 with a full cargo of whale oil. Cretan, Samuel Shrewsbury, master, left Britain on 7 September 1817 on her second whaling voyage, bound for the Galapagos. She was reported there in November 1819. She returned to Britain on 21 July 1820. H. R. Gulliver (or Galloway) sailed Cretan on her third whaling voyage, leaving Britain on 13 January 1821. She was at Tahiti on 24 February 1822;, and Valparaiso on 14 October. She returned to Britain on 20 May 1823 with 500 casks of oil. Captain Gulliver was still master of Cretan on her fourth whaling voyage, sailing her on 3 September 1823 from Britain, bound for the \\"Japans\\".The voyage occurred during Japan's Edo period, when Japan still followed a policy of strict isolationism, forbidding the entry to her ports of almost all foreign vessels. Cretan reached the Cape of Good Hope around 14 November. She was reported to be off the coast of Japan in June-July 1824 with 500 barrels. She returned to Britain on 18 December 1826 with 420 casks of oil. Cretan left Britain on 16 March 1827 on her fifth (and last recorded) whaling voyage with H. R. Gulliver, master, and destination the Sandwich Islands and Timor. Cretan was at Tahiti from 25 August to 21 September 1827. On 18 April 1828 she was at Oahu. Her master arrived at Singapore on 26 August 1828, accusing his chief mate and crew of having mutinied and dispossessed him of his vessel. (During her voyage Stephen Reynolds (or Samuel Reynolds) replaced Gulliver as master.) Cretan was at Honolulu from 29 October to 4 December 1829 with 1110 barrels. She returned to Britain on 29 July 1831 with 400 casks of oil.

It was designed by Frank Gibson Costello and built by Brisbane City Council. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 May 2005.  History  The Brisbane City Council built the concrete shelter at the southern end of Albert Park as an air raid shelter in 1942. On 7 December 1941, the United States of America entered World War Two following the bombing of the American fleet at Pearl Harbour in Hawaii by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. England and its Commonwealth had been at war with Germany since September 1939, but now the war was truly global. The Japanese first bombed Darwin on 19 February 1942 and 14,000 Australians were taken prisoner following the fall of Singapore. Plans to defend Australia from an anticipated Japanese invasion and to use Queensland as a support base for the conduct of the Pacific war were implemented quickly. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland and urgently required a wide range of new buildings and facilities. The population of Brisbane swelled dramatically. As it was the major city in Queensland, and the most northerly major population centre in Australia, military planning headquarters were set up in Brisbane, as were a number of important maintenance, communication, and supply facilities. General Douglas MacArthur, Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces, Southwest Pacific, was based in the AMP building at the corner of Queen Street and Edward Street in Brisbane, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander in Chief of the Australian Forces, used the recently constructed University of Queensland buildings at St Lucia. Brisbane was obviously a strategic target for bombing, and rapid action had to be taken to protect the population in the event of air raids. The demand on materials, services and labour was enormous and military projects took precedence in their allocation. Heavy Anti-Aircraft batteries were built at Victoria Park, Hendra, Pinkenba, Fort Lytton, Hemmant and Balmoral, and coastal artillery batteries were established on Bribie and Moreton Islands. Before the war, Queensland had a small population and no heavy manufacturing industries. To help overcome these problems, some buildings were prefabricated and standard designs for many structures were used. Designs took into account the scarcity of skilled labour and of some materials. The Brisbane City Council took responsibility for Air Raid Precautions activities, including establishing an Air Raid Warden system, firefighting systems and constructing air raid shelters. Aboveground salt water pipes were laid along city streets to aid in firefighting. On Christmas Eve, 1941, each Australian State's Emergency Committee issued instructions for government, private employers and private households to immediately start building shelters. Slit trenches were built in parks and schoolyards, windows were taped, and brownouts were applied to buildings. In the Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1, gazetted 23 December 1941, Premier William Forgan Smith, with powers conferred by Regulation 35a, National Security (General) Regulations, ordered the Brisbane City Council to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Work had already started on 15 December, and later another 75 shelters were ordered. However, only 235 air raid shelters were constructed, the building programme being 90% complete by June 1942. In addition, around three kilometres of covered trenches were constructed in public parks, in 13 projects, including of concrete-pipe covered trench in the City Botanic Gardens, and of the same in Victoria Park. It was believed that one person could be accommodated by each foot of trench. In addition to the public shelters, the Brisbane City Council also constructed shelters for leased wharves and council properties, including at the Stanley Wharf, Circular Quay Wharves 2,3 and 4, Norman Wharf, and Musgrave Wharf. Shelters were built under the Story Bridge, for Kangaroo Point shipbuilding workers, and five shelters were constructed on behalf of the Bureau of Industry at the Howard Smith Wharves. The Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1 was applied statewide, and outside Brisbane another 24 Local Authorities in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public, to be built according to the Air Raid Shelter Code laid down in the Second Schedule of Order No.1. Initially, 20 of the Local Authorities were expected to construct a minimum total of 133 surface shelters, which were supposed to be able to withstand the blast of a 500-pound bomb bursting away. Four other Local Authorities would only build trenches. However, after plans were amended, 23 Local Authorities outside Brisbane, excluding Thursday Island, ended up possessing a total of 129 public shelters: 123 surface and six underground. This effort had cost . Where Local Authorities were unwilling or unable to build the required number of code- compliant shelters, in some cases because they had already begun erecting other shelters, the Department of Public Works became responsible for the shelters' construction. However, this led to problems when the Department tried to recoup half of the cost from the Local Authorities in question. Townsville, Toowoomba, Gladstone, and Ayr denied any liability for costs, and a Bill had to be passed in December 1942 to force their compliance. The Ayr Shire Council had claimed that the shelters would be death traps during an air raid. Of the 235 surface shelters built in Brisbane for the public, 21 survive and are still owned by the Brisbane City Council. One of the shelters, on Queens Wharf Road, is a site-specific \\"special\\" variation of the standard pillbox design. It is listed in the Queensland Heritage Register as part of the entry for the porphyry retaining wall on William Street. The other 20 public shelters owned by the Brisbane City Council can be divided into three types of pillbox intended for conversion after the war: \\"park\\", \\"bus\\", and \\"bus (stone)\\". They were designed to serve as structures such as bus waiting shelters or shade structures for parks, with some or all of the perimeter blast walls to be removed, leaving the concrete slab roof, floor slab and piers. The reusable pillboxes were designed to hold 70 people, as were the non-reusable standard pillboxes. Frank Gibson Costello, Brisbane City Council City Architect between 1941 and 1952, was responsible for the design of the surface air raid shelters, and his variants of the standard pillbox were designed to provide a post-war utility for at least part of the Council's shelter building programme. In an address delivered to the Constitutional Club in Brisbane on February 1942, Costello noted that \\"if the emergency for their use does not arise ...(unused shelters)... remain in brick and concrete, in many cases having no further value and being a possible source of nuisance\\". He added that \\"I can assure you that wherever it is possible, without sacrificing the primary requirements of shelter from air attack, I have endeavoured in our Council buildings to so plan the shelters that they will fit into schemes of improvement which we hope will proceed immediately after the war\\". Costello's work was characterised by the use of an architectural language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, floating flat roofs, masses set against voids and monumentality. Though modest in scale and form, the design of the shelters is characteristic of work in this idiom. The reusable shelters were often sited under fig trees, to aid in camouflage. The first of Costello's reusable designs is the pillbox with double- cantilevered roof slab, or \\"park\\" type shelter. In an original list of all the shelters constructed by the Brisbane City Council, these were simply labelled as \\"cantilever\\". They had four central piers supporting the roof slab, which allowed for the removal of the four blast walls after the war. There was an entrance at each end of the front wall, where an internal wall extended into the shelter. If the walls were made of brick, the shelter's dimension was by by high, and if concrete was used the dimensions were by by high. The difference was due to the fact that the brick walls finished in line with the top of the roof slab, covering the fascia, whereas the concrete walls finished at the soffit of the roof slab, flush with the fascia. The minimum wall thickness for brick was set at 13.5\\", and 12\\" for concrete. The roof slab was intended to have at least four inches of concrete. Of the 37 reusable shelters listed as being of the park type only 17 survive: one at Hefferan Park in Annerley; two at Albert Park (on the north and side souths); two at Wickham Park; one in Buranda Playground in Woolloongabba; two in Raymond Park (on the east and west sides) in Kangaroo Point; and one each at Kelvin Grove, Morningside, Nundah, Stones Corner, and Windsor. Four other shelters stand on East Street and Wickham Street in Fortitude Valley. Most are used as simple park shelters, as intended, but the shelter at Nundah has been modified as a toilet block, and the shelter at Kelvin Grove is used as a bus shelter (as distinct from those shelters in the next category, which were specifically designed as \\"bus\\" type shelters). About half of the surviving park shelters had concrete blast walls, while half used brick. The second design was the pillbox with single-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"bus\\" type shelter, as it was called in the original Brisbane City Council list. These were designed so that the three brick blast walls could be removed after the war, leaving a concrete back wall and five brick piers at the front. Again, entrances were at each end of the front wall. Of the 19 \\"bus\\" types listed only two survive, at Newmarket and Newstead. The third design was also a \\"bus\\" type shelter, but it was built with a stone rear wall, instead of concrete, and six stone piers were later added, instead of five brick piers. The three brick blast walls could be removed as normal. Two of these \\"colonnade\\" types were built ‚Äî referred to in the Brisbane City Council list as \\"bus (stone)\\" ‚Äî and only one survives, at King Edward Park. Most of the Brisbane structures built for the war were removed at the end of World War Two. The saltwater mains, slit trenches, and sirens disappeared, as did the many standard pillboxes that had stood in the middle of the streets of the Central Business District. 156 standard pillboxes were built, but none of the surviving public shelters in Brisbane City Council ownership are of that design. Of the 21 special shelters, only the one on Queens Wharf Road survives. However, of Costello's 58 reusable public surface shelters, 20 have survived; the removal of their blast walls, as planned, had given them a renewed purpose. The worker's shelters at the Story Bridge Hotel and Howard Smith Wharves also still exist. The blast walls of the air raid shelter at Albert Park (South) were removed according to plan after World War Two, although evidence of the location of the walls is still visible. Seating has been introduced and a mosaic decoration has been applied to the south face of the north pier.  Description  Albert Park (South) Air Raid Shelter, 2015 The Albert Park (South) air raid shelter is a rectangular concrete structure comprising a heavy floor slab and a flat roof supported by concrete piers. The shelter stands on the footpath to the south corner of Albert Park within the boundary of Albert Park (now part of the Roma Street Parklands). It is flanked by decorative flowerbeds and accommodates a freestanding wooden seat with concrete legs in the northern bay. The shelter is unpainted, but a rainbow serpent mosaic design decorates the south face of the northern pier, and a rubbish-bin stand has been bolted to the northern part of the floor slab. There is evidence on the floor slab of the two entrances to Wickham Terrace.  Heritage listing  Albert Park (South) Air Raid Shelter was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 May 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Albert Park (South) air raid shelter is important as a part of the Air Raid Precaution activities that were implemented for the defence of Brisbane during World War Two. Designed to afford protection to the civilian population of Brisbane in the event of air raid attacks or other emergencies, the air raid shelter located on the footpath to the south corner of Albert Park is important in demonstrating the impact of World War Two on the civilian population of Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although many air raid shelters were constructed during World War Two in Queensland, comparatively few survive. Also, there are not many types of structures built by the Brisbane City Council during World War Two, for wartime purposes, which survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The shelter's solid construction, rectangular shape, and its siting near a population concentration, demonstrate the principal characteristics of a World War Two Brisbane public air raid shelter. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Albert Park (South) air raid shelter, now used as a shade shelter, demonstrates the secondary uses that were part of the original design intention. The shelter is a durable example of innovative design and use of concrete technology during World War Two. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The air raid shelter is important as an example of the wartime work of the City Architect's Office and particularly the work of City Architect F.G. Costello.

A former amateur champion, he made his professional debut in January 2008 and wrestled for Isegahama stable, one of the more successful stables in sumo today. He reached the top makuuchi division for the first time in May 2013. His highest rank was maegashira 6. He retired in 2019 to become an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Tateyama. Early life and sumo background Miura Yoshiyuki started practicing sumo in his third year of primary school. This was the same primary school as the well-known sumo wrestler Mainoumi had attended several years before. Miura has stated his reason for wanting to practice sumo was that he wanted to be strong so he could protect a girl he liked at the time.Delicious Way Introducing sumo wrestler Homarefuji Yoshiyuki In his third year of middle school (where Mainoumi also attended) he came in second overall in a national junior high school sumo competition. At this time, he was introduced to former yokozuna Asahifuji, who was scouting for prospective wrestlers for his Isegahama stable, through an intermediary. Miura decided at this point that if he were to become a professional sumo wrestler he would join this stable. Miura would continue to practice sumo through high school and as a student at Kinki University, participating in several national competitions. Career Miura, upon joining Isegahama stable, quickly assumed the ring name of Homarefuji. He stepped into the professional sumo ring in March 2008. He would make quick work of the lower three divisions. He achieved an impressive 5‚Äì2 record in his jonokuchi debut in March. Then the very next tournament in May he had a perfect 7‚Äì0 record and defeated Fukao (future Akiseyama) in a playoff for the championship of the jonidan division. He followed this with another 7‚Äì0 record and a playoff win against Surugatsukasa to take the sandanme division championship in July of that year. His speedy rise slowed considerably upon reaching the hotly contested makushita division in September 2008. He began to struggle in this division, and he would fight largely in the middle ranks of makushita for three years. He also had to miss two tournaments due to a left shoulder injury, both of which resulted in him being relegated back to sandanme. On both occasions though, strong records allowed him promotion back to makushita after only one tournament. After his second promotion back to makushita in November 2011 his fortunes began to change. Over the next six tournaments he would only have one losing tournament, and in January 2012 he was promoted to the salaried ranks of the second j≈´ry≈ç division. Over the next several months, he had three tournaments in j≈´ry≈ç and two demotions back to upper makushita. In the July 2012 tournament in this period, Homarefuji participated in the ring entering ceremony wearing a kesh≈ç-mawashi with a panda design on it. It had been provided by a support group in Wakayama prefecture to commemorate the birth of a baby panda in Ueno Zoo in Tokyo just two days before the beginning of the tournament. Sadly, the baby panda died only four days into the tournament. Homarefuji later lamented that his lackluster 5‚Äì10 performance that tournament did not give the baby panda the proper memorial, and he deserved the demotion.Sumo Magazine August 2012 edition, p.54 He found his stride from the November 2012 tournament after his third j≈´ry≈ç promotion. He recorded three consecutive 10-5 tournaments in this division, and was added to the ranks of the top makuuchi division for the first time in May 2013. He was the first wrestler from Aomori prefecture (a place known for producing many strong wrestlers) to enter makuuchi since Takarafuji (also from the Isegahama stable) in July 2011. Homarefuji only lasted one tournament however, as a 5‚Äì10 record in lower makuuchi saw him again in the ranks of j≈´ry≈ç. For the next sixteen months, he became a j≈´ry≈ç regular, recording around the same number of winning and losing tournaments. In the last three tournaments of this period in September 2014, he managed a string of winning tournaments which culminated in an 11‚Äì4 record, his strongest showing ever since becoming a sekitori. In the following November he was re-promoted to makuuchi. He had two consecutive winning 8‚Äì7 tournaments and reached maegashira 7 for the March tournament in Osaka. Since then his progress has stalled and he was demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç for the March 2016 tournament. He reappeared in makuuchi in September 2016, but had to withdraw from the tournament on Day 4 after getting injured on the opening day. He lost sekitori status when he was demoted from the j≈´ry≈ç division after the July 2018 tournament, and after missing several tournaments through injury he had fallen to sandanme 77 by May 2019. He competed in just one match in the May 2019 tournament, which he won, resulting in a drop to jonidan. Retirement from sumo After a 6-1 record in jonidan in July he won four of his seven bouts in September 2019 before announcing his retirement. He is staying in sumo as a toshiyori or elder of the Japan Sumo Association and a coach at Isegahama stable. He is now known as Tateyama Oyakata, the elder share previously held by the former head of the Kataonami stable, ex-sekiwake Tamanofuji. Fighting style Homarefuji was an oshi-sumo specialist who preferred pushing and slapping techniques to fighting on the mawashi or belt. His most common winning kimarite or technique is oshi-dashi, or push-out. According to his Japan Sumo Association profile, as of January 2015 he had won 44 of his last 75 bouts and 61 per cent had been won by oshidashi. Personal life Homarefuji announced his engagement in February 2017, and his wedding reception was held in June at the Tokyo Royal Park hotel with 500 guest attending.

Research  Andrzej Wieckowski‚Äôs research was focused on the development and use of spectroscopic methods to characterize the surface structure of electrocatalysts, including fuel cell catalysts, and on the understanding surface oxidation and reduction processes at a molecular level. In collaboration with Eric Oldfield, Wieckowski pioneered the development of electrochemical NMR spectroscopy (EC-NMR), combining metal/surface NMR and electrochemistry to study electrochemical interfaces.Y.

Her novel, Mislaid, was longlisted for the National Book Award. The Wallcreeper, Zink's debut novel, released in the US by the independent Dorothy, a Publishing Project, was named one of 100 notable books of 2014 by The New York Times. Biography Zink was raised in rural Virginia, a setting she draws on in her novel Mislaid (Ecco, 2015). She attended Stuart Hall School and the College of William and Mary, where she earned a B.A. in Philosophy. In 1993, while living in West Philadelphia, Zink founded a zine called Animal Review, which ran until 1997 and \\"featured submissions and interviews with punk musicians about their pets, from King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp writing about his rabbit Beaton Bunnerius Bun, to Jon Langford, of British punk band The Mekons, discussing his loach fish.\\" Zink has worked as a secretary at Colgate-Palmolive, and as a technical writer in Tel Aviv. Zink moved to Germany in May 2000, eventually earning a PhD in Media Studies from the University of T√ºbingen. She worked as a contributor for the daily newspaper in T√ºbingen, Schw√§bisches Tagblatt, and later as a translator for Zeitenspiegel agency. Writing career After fifteen years spent writing fiction exclusively for a single pen pal, the Israeli postmodernist Avner Shats, Zink caught the attention of Jonathan Franzen with a \\"brazen\\" letter promoting the work of the German ornithologist Martin Schneider-Jacoby. The two writers began a correspondence, and Franzen was surprised to learn that Zink had no published literary work. Zink began to create work for Franzen: > I was so tired of Franzen saying that I should take myself seriously as a > writer and I wanted to make very clear that there's a very clear distinction > between taking your career seriously and taking your writing seriously. So I > wrote the first part of a new novel, called The Wallcreeper, in just four > days to show him that I knew what I was doing as a writer. In early 2012, Zink sent Franzen her collected manuscripts. Franzen tried unsuccessfully to interest publishers in her 1998 novel Sailing Towards the Sunset by Avner Shats (sic). It was Franzen's agent who finally negotiated a six-figure publishing deal for Zink's Mislaid. Meanwhile, The Wallcreeper, \\"about a bird-loving American couple that moves to Europe and becomes, basically, eco-terrorists\\" (Keith Gessen), was published independently in the United States in 2014. New York Times reviewer Robin Romm wrote \\"Zink's work may be, at times, cerebral and a little distancing, but its vitality and purpose are invigorating.\\" and that, \\"The passages about European environmental groups, government programs and methods of protest are less universal and more like amusement for insiders -- more like the impromptu they started as, in other words.\\" Overall she compliments the book on its humor, liveliness, and critique of humanity's \\"mindless consumption\\". Kirkus Reviews called it \\"a brief yet masterful novel of epic breadth.\\" In Joe Dunthornes' review of \\"Nicotine\\", he says, \\"There is a recklessness and a freshness to this complex tale that is at its best when its elements of horror and humor collide.\\" Zink's second novel, Mislaid (Ecco/HarperCollins, 2015), her first under a major publisher, follows the story of a white lesbian, Peggy, later 'Meg', born in rural Virginia in the 1960s. Peggy leaves her marriage to her gay professor, and with the help of a stolen birth certificate, creates a new African-American identity for herself and her daughter, Mireille/Karen. Accounting for this unusual 'passing', Peggy/Meg explains: \\"Virginia was settled before slavery began, and it was diverse. There were tawny black people with hazel eyes. Black people with auburn hair, skin like butter and eyes of deep blue green. Blond, blue-eyed black people resembling a recent chairman of the N.A.A.C.P. The only way to tell white from colored for purposes of segregation was the one-drop rule: If one of your ancestors was black ‚Äî ever in the history of the world, all the way back to Noah's son Ham ‚Äî so were you.\\" Though Dwight Garner called the book \\"a minor and misshapen novel from a potentially major voice,\\" he later named it among his top ten books for the year. Walter Kirn, in the New York Times Book Review, found it a \\"provocative masquerade with heart,\\" identifying an \\"elegance and confidence that are exceptionally rare now.\\" Times Magazine writer Daniel J. Sharfstein has observed that while Zink's plot may be \\"over-the-top,\\" the real-life case of former NAACP chapter president Rachel Dolezal bears a remarkable parallel. In a New York Times book review of Nell Zink's \\"Nicotine\\", Dwight Garner praises the book, saying, \\"I could listen to Ms Zink's dialogue all day; she may be, at heart, a playwright.\\" In Joe Dunthorne's review of Nicotine, he says \\"There is a recklessness and a freshness to this complex tale that is at its best when its elements of horror and humor collide.\\" He only criticizes the overcomplexity of the plot. In a book review about Mislaid by Walter Kirn, he admits that toward the end of the novel, \\"Piquancy and intimacy are lost, sacrificed to momentum and high mayhem. The damage isn't fatal, though; the novel's charm and intelligence ran deep.\\" Overall, he compliments the book's pace and \\"sharp observations\\" made by her narration. Personal life Zink lives in Bad Belzig, Germany. Zink worked in construction, waited tables, and was a secretary before working as a translator. \\"There's never a market for true art,\\" Zink told an interviewer, \\"so my main concern was always to have a job that didn't require me to write or think.\\" Zink has been married twice. On May 8, 1990, she married Benjamin Alexander Burck in a \\"very simple civil ceremony\\" at the Henrico County Courthouse in Richmond, Virginia. She later married the Israeli composer and poet Zohar Eitan.

The \\"A\\" in the train's name comes from \\"Arirang\\" (a Korean folk song), and the words \\"amazement\\" and \\"adventure\\". The song has many variations, and the Jeongseon Arirang is a regional one. The song is listed as an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO and sometimes regarded as an unofficial anthem of Korea. The train has four themed cars with large windows and glass walls; one is a sky room, one a tea room, and two of the cars are decorated in regional colors of red, yellow, blue and purple representing Jeongseon's geographical features such as the Dong River and the mountain ridges. The train's exterior includes a purple color for the pulsatilla, Jeongseon's official flower, and is decorated with curves that symbolize the Arirang melody. Activities on the train include storytelling, music, magic shows and quiz games.

It was released as the group's second single, and was the first and most successful tune for the Barbarians to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and Cashbox. Following the group's unsuccessful debut, \\"Hey Little Bird\\", The Barbarians had their breakthrough with an appearance, alongside other musical artists such as The Rolling Stones and The Supremes, on The T.A.M.I. Show. In order to take advantage of their exposure, the band recorded \\"Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl\\" with the B-side, \\"Take It or Leave It\\". Guitarist Geoffry Morris, who had recently joined the band, was responsible for the arrangements. The song reflected the social commentary of the period, specifically around what distinguishes a male from a female. The lyrics express both sides' opposing views on issues like hair length or how a person dresses. The band members themselves grew their hair long and wore unusual clothing. Jerry Causi, as lead vocalist, initiates call and response with Bruce Benson and Jeff Morris on backing vocals. There is also mockery toward bands from England with lyrics like \\"Your're either a girl, or you come from Liverpool\\", and more specifically \\"You can dance like a female monkey, but sink like a stone...yeah a rolling stone\\", a direct reference to The Rolling Stones. The song ends with a brief R&B-influenced; guitar solo before fading out. \\"Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl\\", with its B-side \\"Take It or Leave It\\", was released in September 1965 on the Laurie label. It peaked at number 55 nationally, and stayed on the charts for six weeks. The song was also featured on the group's debut album of the same name, as the opening track. Despite the publicity following their modest hit, the album failed to chart.

It is approximately long and flows through Franklin Township, Dallas Township, Kingston Township, West Wyoming, Wyoming, and Forty Fort. The watershed of the creek has an area of and occupies portions of nine municipalities in northeastern Luzerne County. The watershed is divided into the upper Abraham Creek watershed and the lower Abraham Creek watershed, which are joined by a canyon known as The Hollow. The upper part of the watershed is mostly rural, but the lower part is heavily urbanized. The creek's channel has been heavily modified in many places. Its drainage basin is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Abrahams Creek is a perennial stream with relatively poor water quality. However, it is not considered to be impaired. Its pH ranges from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline and has a daily sediment load of nearly 14 million pounds (31 million kilograms) per day. The main rock formations in the watershed include the Catskill Formation, the Llewellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Pocono Formation. The main soils include the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil, the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil, the Udorthents- Urban Land-Volusia soil, and the Volusia-Mardin-Lordstown soil. Abrahams Creek is named after a historic Mohican chief of a village in the area. The creek's watershed was historically heavily logged and farmed and a sediment retention structure was built in the watershed in the 1970s. Numerous bridges have been built over the creek since 1925. The Abrahams Creek Watershed Association operates in the watershed. A 500-million-gallon reservoir known as Frances Slocum Lake was built on the creek in 1965. Course Abrahams Creek begins in Franklin Township. It flows south-southwest for a short distance before turning south for several tenths of a mile, passing through the border between Dallas Township, Franklin Township, and Kingston Township, and entering Kingston Township. The creek then continues south for more than a mile before turning southeast and eventually entering Frances Slocum Lake. On the southeastern end of the lake, the creek turns east-northeast for more than a mile, entering a deep valley. It then turns south-southeast for a few miles, entering West Wyoming flowing through a water gap. The creek then turns southeast for some distance before turning southwest and entering Wyoming. It then turns west-southwest for a few miles before turning south and then west. The creek then turns south again, crossing US Route 11. It then turns southwest for more than a mile, entering Forty Fort and reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Abrahams Creek joins the Susquehanna River upstream of its mouth. =Tributaries= Hicks Creek was historically a tributary of Abrahams Creek. However, it was diverted to the northeast by strip mining in the 1940s and 1950s. It currently flows into the Susquehanna River. At present, Abrahams Creek has no officially named tributaries. However, it has six unnamed tributaries, two of which enter it from the left and four of which enter it from the right. Hydrology and climate Abrahams Creek likely has relatively poor water quality, especially in its lower reaches. However, it is not considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired. The creek is a perennial stream. It has experienced erosion in some places. The creek's discharge was in its upper reaches was measured to be on May 12, 1970, and on September 17, 1970. Further downstream, at West Wyoming, the discharge was measured twice in the 1960s. The values were . The daily load of sediment in Abrahams Creek is , which equates to a unit area loading of per acre per day. A total of comes from \\"transitional\\" land, comes from cropland, and comes from stream banks. A total of comes from hay and pastures and come from forested land.

The 20-year average annual runoff rate is per year. In the early 1970s, the water temperature of the creek near Dallas in several measurements ranged from . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Abrahams Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The highest point in the watershed is on Bunker Hill, at slightly over above sea level. The lowest point in the watershed is at the creek's mouth. There are plains to the north of Abrahams Creek. Wetlands known as the Abrahams Creek Wetlands are in the vicinity of the creek. They consist of several ponds along the side of the creek in Franklin Township, Kingston Township, and Dallas Township. The wetlands are listed on the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory. The creek is in entirely in the ridge and valley physiographic province, specifically, the Anthracite Valley Section. The Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge crosses the watershed and divides it into two drainage basins: the upper Abrahams Creek watershed, which consists of rolling hills, and the lower Abrahams Creek watershed, which is on a natural debris fan and the old floodplain of the Susquehanna River. Between the two is \\"The Hollow\\", a narrow canyon flowing through the ridge. The course of Abrahams Creek has been altered by flood control projects. There is a sediment retention structure on the creek at the lower end of \\"The Hollow\\". Large portions of the creek, especially in its lower reaches, have undergone full stream channelization, with the stream channel being hardened by concrete or rock. In West Wyoming, a nearly mile-long stretch is lined with concrete. In the early 20th century, part of the creek above The Hollow had grouted stone walls, which were completed in the 1930s. In the Abrahams Creek watershed, 94 percent of the rock is interbedded sedimentary rock. The remaining 6 percent is sandstone. The main rock formations in the watershed of Abrahams Creek include the Catskill Formation, the Llwellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Pocono Formation. These formations mainly consist of coal, limestone, sandstone, shale, and siltstone. The Catskill Formation mainly occurs in the watershed's upper reaches. The Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pocono Formation, and the Pottsville Group occur under the Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge. The Llwellyn Formation also occurs there, in addition to underlying the floodplain in the watershed. A considerable area in the watershed has been strip mined. The main soils in the watershed of Abrahams Creek include the Chenango-Pope-Holly soil, the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil, the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil, and the Volusia-Mardin-Lordstown soil. The watershed's soils are in mostly the hydrologic soil groups B and C. However, the hydrological soil group D is also present. Watershed The watershed of Abrahams Creek has an area of . The creek's mouth is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Pittston. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Kingston. There are approximately of open stream channels in the watershed. The creek's watershed is situated in the northeastern part of Luzerne County and occupies portions of nine municipalities: Exeter, Forty Fort, Swoersville, West Wyoming, Wyoming, Dallas Township, Exeter Township, Franklin Township, and Kingston Township. The watershed is described as being hourglass-shaped in the Abrahams Creek Watershed Assessment and Project Prioritization. A total of 80 percent of the Abrahams Creek watershed is rural and 20 percent is urbanized. The lower reaches of the watershed contain most of the urbanization. Its upper reaches contain second-growth forest, small patches of residential land, linear hedgerows, and agricultural land such as hay pastures, pastures, and farmland. The Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge is too steep to be developed, but many other areas of the watershed could easily be urbanized. The mining- affected land in the watershed is in West Wyoming. A total of 51 percent of the watershed of Abrahams Creek consists of forested land. A total of 26 percent of the watershed consists of agricultural land and 18 percent is developed. The remaining 2 percent consists of \\"disturbed\\" land. Abrahams Creek is the main source of flooding in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can occur when the creek floods over Eighth Street. There is a flood protection project for the creek in West Wyoming. This protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods. The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street. Abrahams Creek flows through Frances Slocum State Park and passes through Frances Slocum Lake, a flood-control lake with a volume of half a billion gallons. Most of the upper reaches of the watershed drain into the lake. The creek is also dammed in this location. The lake was created in 1965 by the construction of an earthen dam across the creek. A pond known as Burketts Pond is on a tributary of the creek. It is partially filled and has a decaying stone dam. If the dam collapsed, damage could potentially reach up to downstream. There are numerous other dammed ponds in the watershed's upper reaches. Historically, wetlands formed the sources of many headwater streams in the area, but many have been drained or flooded by imoundments. The watershed of Abrahams Creek is continuing to become more developed, but at a slower rate than it has in the past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. This has been the case as early 1893. The upper reaches of the watershed have a dendritic drainage system. Abrahams Creek is one of 19 streams in Luzerne County to be designated for stormwater management. History, name, and etymology Abrahams Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1200061. The creek is also known as Abraham Creek, Abraham's Creek, Abram Creek, or Abrams Creek. The name \\"Abraham's Creek\\" was once the official name of the creek. It was also referred to by this name in an 1860 map. Historically, the Mohicans had a settlement on the banks of Abrahams Creek. The creek is named after Abraham, a chief of that village. Extensive logging and intense agriculture were historically done in the watershed of Abrahams Creek. The area was already beginning to experience road encroachment as early as 1893. Several bridges have been built over Abrahams Creek. A concrete slab bridge carrying State Route 1021/East Eighth Street was built in 1925. It is long and is situated in West Wyoming. A concrete stringer bridge carrying State Route 1010 was constructed over the creek in 1929. This bridge is long and is also situated in West Wyoming. A concrete tee beam carrying US Route 11 was built in 1939. It is long and is situated in Forty Fort. Another bridge carrying US Route 11 was built in Wyoming in 1953. It is a 14-span steel culvert bridge with a length of . A 2-span concrete tee beam bridge was constructed over the creek in 1962 in Wyoming. It is long and carries State Route 1021. A steel culvert bridge carrying State Route 1044 was built in 1965. It is long and situated in Kingston Township. A prestressed box beam bridge carrying State Route 1036/Carverton Road was constructed over the creek in 1976. This bridge is long and is situated in Kingston Township. Four bridges over the creek are classified as being structurally deficient, as of 2007. The entire watershed of Abrahams Creek, including all of the streams and wetlands, has been significantly modified by both historical and modern land uses in the area. The natural surface water hydrology of the watershed was substantially modified by projects of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection from the 1950s until the 1990s. The sediment retention structure in The Hollow was constructed in the 1970s. Abrahams Creek has a watershed association known as the Abrahams Creek Watershed Association. It was awarded the Watershed Stewardship Award by the Luzerne Conservation District in 2009. The organization also received a $5000 grand from American Water for improving water quality, adding riparian buffers, and other projects. Damaging flooding in 2006 caused the Abrahams Creek Watershed Assessment and Project Prioritization to be created. The creek was used as a reference watershed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection when developing a total maximum daily load for the nearby Solomon Creek. Biology Nearly all of the watershed of Abrahams Creek is biologically degraded, with the only exceptions being several headwater streams. However, the upper part of the watershed is less severely degraded than the lower reaches. The drainage basin of Abrahams Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in a section of a tributary of the creek in West Wyoming. This stretch is long. There is an herbaceous wetland along Abrahams Creek just upstream of where it enters Frances Slocum Lake. Further to the north, there is a flooded forested wetland. The creek has a substantial riparian buffer upstream of Frances Slocum Lake. The plant species Carex disperma inhabits the area. Bird species such as Virginia rail and Sora inhabit the area as well.

Hillman was awarded the World Medal for Sound Design at the New York Festival for the film The 13th Day in 2010 and in November 2010 was awarded the Royal Television Society award for Best Production Craft Skills for Sound Design and Mixing on the film Handle With Care. Early life and Education Hillman began his career as an electronics engineer with American machine tool manufacturer Cincinnati Milacron. After completing his apprenticeship he graduated from the University of Aston in Industrial Electronics and Instrumentation in 1981, after previously studying Electrical and Mechanical Engineering at Matthew Boulton College and North Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University). He completed his PhD by Practice within the University of York‚Äôs Department of Theatre, Film and Television (TFTV), researching Emotion in Sound Design under the supervision of Dr. Sandra Paulettohttps://www.york.ac.uk/tfti/study/postgraduate/profiles/neil-hillman- profile/http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/24020/. Career After completing his foundation degree and apprenticeship in Electrical Engineering, Hillman joined the Midlands-based Central Independent Television in 1982 as a sound technician, working on all aspects of broadcast audio. He left Central TV in 1989 to work as a freelance location Sound Recordist, Dubbing Mixer and Broadcast Sound Supervisor. During this time he contributed regularly to long- running BBC TV series', including The Antiques Roadshow (where he introduced stereo location recording to the programme), travelled extensively overseas to record sound for programmes such as Tomorrow's World and Top Gear, and recorded and mixed choral music on location for Songs of Praise. In 1999 Hillman was invited to join Optical Image, a growing UK video post-production company, in a new position as Head of Sound. Hillman set up the post- production sound department for a joint animation venture with Mike Young Productions, Butt Ugly Martians; a 26-part production where Hillman worked alongside Producer Bill Schultz, better known at this time for his role as a Producer on US animation hits The Simpsons and King of the Hill. Hillman was the Sound Designer and re-recording mixer for the entire Butt Ugly Martians series, collaborating with multiple-Emmy winning Sound Editor, Rick Hinson MPSE on episodes 1 and 2. Between 2000 and 2001, he both location recorded and then audio post-produced a four-part series for Discovery, called Beyond The Horizon, which documented a year in the lives of a group of RAF pilots as they attempted to qualify for the elite Red Arrows display team. The year spent working alongside such excellence, Hillman later said, would irrevocably focus his determination and commitment to achieve similar levels of quality and professionalism in his own work. Hillman left Optical Image in 2002 to form his own audio post-production studios, The Audio Suite. Between 2002 and 2012, The Audio Suite worked as preferred audio suppliers to All3Media, the UK's largest television Production Group, and they were also suppliers to the terrestrial channels of BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel Five and the digital channels BBC Three, BBC Four, ITV4, National Geographic and Discovery. During this time Hillman and The Audio Suite worked on some of the most popular shows on UK television, including Channel Five's The Gadget Show, as well as contributing ADR (also known as dubbing) to prestigious TV dramas such as Spooks, Hustle and Survivors for the BBC. Also during this period, Hillman passed the 500 IMDb (Internet Movie Database) credit mark and worked as the Sound Designer and Re-recording mixer on feature films including The 13th Day (for which he was awarded a World Medal for Sound Design at the 2010 New York Film Festival), The Mandrake Root, The Craftsman (a finalist in the 2013 New York Film Festival best soundtrack category), Handle With Care (the film earned two Royal Television Society awards: Best Production Skills for Hillman's soundtrack and Best Short Film), Money Kills, and contributed ADR services to film productions such as Director Steven Spielberg's Lincoln, (re- recording the dialogue of the character Tad Lincoln, played by Gulliver McGrath) for DreamWorks, New York I Love You, (re-recording Oscar-winning actress Julie Christie with Director Shekhar Kapur, who took the Directorial reins following the untimely death of the original Director Anthony Minghella) and Grace of Monaco. In 2012, Hillman transitioned The Audio Suite from a large commercial work-for-hire post-production facility, with a large city- centre studio complex, to a smaller, bespoke Sound Design practice with in- house studios, where he currently works as a Broadcast Sound and Post- Production Consultant. Current work After transitioning The Audio Suite into a smaller and more agile Sound Design practice, two of Hillman's initial projects were the sound design and mixing of Film Director Pip Piper's musical documentary Last Shop Standing, featuring British musicians Paul Weller, Johnny Marr, Norman Cook, Clint Boon, Richard Hawley and Billy Bragg, which went on to earn a maximum 5-star review in Q magazine; and the sound design, sound editing and mixing of Director Lisle Turner's feature film Here And Now, with final mixing taking place at the legendary AIR studios (Associated Independent Recording), London. He has recently contributed to a number of television shows and features, including Star Wars Rebels for Disney in the US, and Doctor Who, The Only Way Is Essex, Death Comes to Pemberley, Doc Martin and Peaky Blinders in the UK. His feature film work continues to include production sound mixing (as a location Sound Recordist) as well as audio post-production, as a Supervising Sound Editor / Sound Designer. In 2015 Hillman was the Production Sound Mixer for the film Scott and Sid which went on to win several awards including Best British Film at the National Film Awards in 2019https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/uk- news/scott-and-sid- national-award-debut-movie-about-two-friends-bradford- chasing-their- dreams-1757578 retrieved 09-05-20). In 2017 he was the Dialogue Editor and Supervising Sound Editor / Sound Designer for the British independent film Finding Fatimahhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt6413712/reference which was edited and pre-mixed at The Audio Suite and mixed for theatrical release at Pinewood Studios. In 2018 he completed the sound design and mixing work on the second of Director Pip Piper‚Äôs trilogy on record stores, vinyl records and independent music venues, The Vinyl Revivalhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt10157926/reference which featured Pink Floyd‚Äôs Nick Mason, Portishead guitarist Adrian Utley and emerging band, The Orielles. The final film of the series, Long and Winding Road premiered at Bush Hall, London on January 21st 2020https://www.independentvenueweek.com/2020/01/long-and-winding-road-film- premier/ and featured Radiohead musician Philip Selway talking with small venue owners and artists including Nick Mason, Adrian Utley, IDLES, Nadine Shah, Gaz Coombes, Novelist, Richard Hawley, Talk Show, Squid, Pip Blom and venues such as the 100 Club, The Boileroom, the John Peel Centre, the Trades Club, Bush Hall, the Brudenell Social Club, The Cookie, the Moles Club, The New Adelphi Club, The Leadmill, and 229 The Venue. Through the Audio Suite's Sound Design practice, he is also regularly engaged by marketing agencies and commercial production companies to help with the promotion of national and international brands. As well as his operational work of sound designing, editing and mixing, Hillman consults to Production Companies and Broadcasters on strategic planning for projects with complex workflow and delivery requirements, with clients such as the Olympic Broadcasting Services and UEFA. He worked as an Audio Mixer and as Commentary Control Liaison at the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics, the Foreign Commentary Broadcast Liaison (CCR) for the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final, Sound Supervisor for Boxing at the 2014 XX Glasgow Commonwealth Games, Commentary Control Liaison at the Rio 2016 Olympics and as part of the team installing and operating the Commentary Switching Centre within the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. Under the Dr. Neil Hillman banner, his Consultancy practice aids a diverse range of clients including film and television Producers with viability and budgeting analysis for below-the-line shooting and post-production costs, as well as equipment manufacturers and systems suppliers at the product design, development and application stages of new industry products. This advisory service extends to areas wider than film and television; consulting to a range of industry sectors on user interfaces (UI), the end-user experience and on creating more efficient workflow by embracing new ways of thinking about existing systems and production arrangements. Writing and publications In 1997 Hillman started writing articles regularly for the industry-leading audio magazine Studio Sound, as well as other industry titles including Audio Media, TVB Europe, Line Up and Stage and Screen, and occasionally for mainstream publications such as BBC Top Gear magazine.Top Gear magazine (UK), 1 July 1997, Vol. 46, p. 61, Neil Hillman, \\"Sidelight\\" In 2001, Hillman was asked to become a member of a small team of writers for a new professional audio magazine called Resolution, assembled by ex-Studio Sound Editor Zenon Schoepe. Hillman went on to contribute regularly to 'Resolution' magazine for over ten years, commencing with its first issue, writing on modern sound production and reviewing equipment. His first book, Journeyman, was published in October 2013 and is a retrospective view of the most significant decade of digital development (2000 - 2010) in the professional audio-for-picture sector. He has been featured in several newspapers regarding his outspoken views on the demise of regional production in the English Midlands, and sound quality for broadcast television; including The Birmingham Posthttps://www.business- live.co.uk/enterprise/bbc-midlands-fair-share- campaign-8726130https://www.business-live.co.uk/enterprise/now-never-bbc- birmingham-11285381 and The Daily Telegraphhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/12/23/bbc-criticised-mumbling- adaptation-christmas-carol/.

The book 'Sound for Moving Pictures: the Four Sound Areas' is scheduled for publication in January 2021. Research and teaching In 2010, Hillman commenced a part-time PhD by Practice within the University of York‚Äôs Department of Theatre, Film and Television (TFTV), researching Emotion in Sound Design under the supervision of Dr. Sandra Pauletto. His research involved the Emotion of Sound Design and how sound designers may determine and predict how an audience will react to certain audio stimuli when these are used to support and enhance moving pictures. He is a member of the TFTV Sound Design research group. His PhD research resulted in three academic papers: 'The Craftsman: the use of sound design to elicit emotions' was presented at the University of Ulster's Cinesonika 3 conference in February 2013, and in July 2013 Hillman presented 'Organic and free-range sound design' at the University of York's International Sound Symposium.

It was written by Matthew Negrete and directed by Jennifer Lynch. It marked Tyler James Williams' final appearance as supporting character Noah and Daniel Bonjour's final appearance as Aiden Monroe. Plot Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam), torn over by his loss of faith, tears up a Bible. As Rick (Andrew Lincoln) makes his rounds, he passes Jessie's (Alexandra Breckenridge) house and notices her working on one of her sculptures, which has been vandalized. Rick offers to find the culprit, but she brushes him off. Rick is later approached by Jessie's husband Pete (Corey Brill), who tries to cultivate a friendship with him. Elsewhere, Noah asks to meet with Reg (Steve Coulter) to become his student so he'll know what to do to keep the walls up. Parts are needed from a nearby warehouse to repair the solar power system. Eugene (Josh McDermitt) is reluctant to go, but is the only one that can identify the required parts; he is joined by Glenn (Steven Yeun), Noah (Tyler James Williams), Tara (Alanna Masterson), Aiden (Daniel Bonjour), and Nicholas (Michael Traynor). Although the group is initially cautious, Aiden's poor shooting skills (as he shot a grenade) leads to him being impaled and Tara suffering a severe head injury. As the group readies Tara, they are shocked to learn Aiden is still alive but has been impaled to a wall. After Eugene promises to protect Tara, the others try to free Aiden. Realizing it is impossible, they leave Aiden to be attacked. Nicholas, panicking at the onslaught of walkers, tries to flee through revolving doors in the front of the warehouse. Glenn and Noah try to follow to stop him but all three end up surrounded by walkers and stuck in the door. Eugene is able to overcome his cowardice to evacuate Tara to their van which he uses to lure the walkers away from outside the building. However, Nicholas fails to listen to Glenn's advice and causes the door to open far enough for the walkers to grab and drag Noah out, where he is consumed; a horrified Glenn watches but can do nothing. Nicholas catches up to Eugene in the van and threatens to leave him behind. Glenn, having made it out of the door, knocks Nicholas out. Though they have collected the parts, the ride back to Alexandria is somber and they hold Nicholas under gunpoint. Meanwhile, Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) helps a crew to extend Alexandria's walls. When the crew is ambushed by walkers, trapping their lookout Francine (Dahlia Legault), the foreman Tobin (Jason Douglas) sees no way to save her and orders them to abandon her. Abraham instead races in to help rescue her, later assisted by other members of the crew. With the walkers dispatched, Abraham takes leadership of the group. Tobin later resigns his position to Deanna (Tovah Feldshuh), Reg, and Maggie (Lauren Cohan) admitting that Abraham is a better leader. Deanna agrees, but expresses her concern to Maggie that Rick's group is quickly filling in positions of leadership in the community. Father Gabriel later speaks to Deanna, expressing his doubts on the sincerity of Rick's group and not to trust them, unaware that Maggie has overheard them. Carol (Melissa McBride) is visited several times by Jessie's son, Sam (Major Dodson), who keeps asking for cookies. To get rid of him, Carol tells him she will only make them if he steals two bars of chocolate from the town's food storage. Sam returns with the chocolate. While waiting for the cookies to bake, he admits to breaking Jessie's statue, then asks for one of her guns. When Carol asks him why, he runs off. She goes to the Anderson home to try and talk to Sam or Jessie, but is coldly turned away by Pete, arousing her suspicion. When Rick returns home, Carol tells him that Pete is abusing Jessie and maybe Sam, and the only way to stop it is to kill Pete.

It was written by Angela Kang and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis. While grieving for Aiden, Deanna begins to reconsider her choice to bring in Rick's group after Nicholas lies about the circumstances of Noah's death, as tensions begin to rise between Rick and Pete over the latter's abuse towards Jessie, and Rick's brutality begins to boil into insanity. The group also grieves over Noah's death, with Glenn becoming traumatized while Sasha is overwhelmed with grief and begins hunting walkers, forcing Michonne and Rosita to chase her. Aaron and Daryl continue to look for survivors while Carl and Enid bond. Plot Deanna Monroe (Tovah Feldshuh) and her family mourns Aiden's (Daniel Bonjour) death when Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) leaves a tuna pasta bake and a note of condolences on Deanna's doorstep. Deanna picks up the note leaving the pasta behind and afterwards proceeds to burn the card. She then watches a video of Nicholas (Michael Traynor) describing the incident, in which he lies and places blames on Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) for Aiden and Noah's (Tyler James Williams) deaths, while Glenn relates the true series of events to Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln). Deanna prohibits them from carrying firearms and from leaving the Safe-Zone while she investigates. The next morning, Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos) tells Michonne (Danai Gurira) that Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) has gone missing from her post in the tower. Worried, they venture outside the walls to look for her. They find several dead walkers and realize Sasha is actively hunting them. They track her down and help her eliminate a large pack of walkers, which leads to an outburst from Sasha. Glenn confronts Nicholas and tells him men like him should have died to the walkers, but he was lucky that the Alexandria's walls came up in time. Glenn tells Nicholas never to set foot outside of the walls again. Fearing that Glenn will reveal his cowardice, Nicholas later retrieves a pistol, the same one that Rick had stashed away but lost. Meanwhile, Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs) follows Enid (Katelyn Nacon) outside the walls. She reveals she knows Carl has been following her, but allows him to come with her. They bond over their shared experiences as survivors from the outside, but are forced to hide inside a hollow tree from a walker horde. Enid says the world belongs to the walkers, and humans just live in it. They look into each other's eyes, and Carl touches Enid's hand for a second before pulling back. Elsewhere outside the walls, Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Aaron (Ross Marquand) notice more walkers are coming into the area. They investigate a light in the distance and come across freshly-severed limbs and a woman who had been tied to a tree and eaten alive by walkers, her body reanimating as they find her, killing the resultant walker. There is a \\"W\\" carved into her forehead. Rick approaches Deanna about Pete Anderson's (Corey Brill) abusive behavior, and is shocked when Deanna reveals she already knows about it. Since Pete is a surgeon, his skills are invaluable to Alexandria and Deanna is not willing to have Pete separated from Jessie (Alexandra Breckenridge) or executed. If it comes down to it, she says that she will have Pete exiled. Rick believes exiling Pete will only put Alexandria in danger, but Deanna refuses to listen. Rick talks to Jessie again and reveals that he knows Pete is abusing her. Jessie assures Rick she can fix her relationship with Pete, but Rick is not convinced. He promises to protect Jessie, and she agrees to let him protect her just as Pete returns home. Jessie stands up for herself and orders Pete to leave, but Pete grows angry and the two men begin to fight. Their fight makes its way to the street as the entire town watches. Jessie and Carl attempt to stop the fight, but fail. Rick finally subdues Pete in a headlock. Deanna orders Rick to stand down, but Rick doesn't acknowledge, instead warning Pete that if he harms either Jessie or Sam again, he will kill him. Deanna once again orders Rick to withdraw, but Rick points his revolver at the crowd and goes on a rant, telling Deanna how Alexandria is too complacent and will eventually destroy itself under her leadership, and that the way to survive is to have people like Pete executed. Michonne eventually silences him mid-rant by knocking him unconscious.

It was written by showrunner Scott M. Gimple and Seth Hoffman, and directed by Greg Nicotero. Several recurring storylines culminate in the episode: the residents of the Alexandria Safe-Zone deciding on what to do with Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) following his outburst in the previous episode; Glenn Rhee's (Steven Yeun) conflict with Nicholas (Michael Traynor); and Sasha Williams (Sonequa Martin-Green) and Father Gabriel Stokes (Seth Gilliam) confronting their demons. Meanwhile, Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Aaron (Ross Marquand) encounter trouble from a potential threat during a run, and Morgan Jones (Lennie James) nears the end of his search for Rick. Similar to the pilot episode and the season two premiere, the episode aired in a 90-minute time slot, as opposed to its regular 60-minute time slot. Television commentators lauded the character progression, its storytelling, Nicotero's direction, Gimple's and Hoffman's script and the ensemble's performances. Many highlighted Andrew Lincoln and Lennie James's performances, as well as the character progression of Carol Peletier. Upon airing, it attracted 15.8 million viewers with an 18-49 rating of 8.2, making it the most watched season finale in the show and drama in basic cable history. This episode marks the last appearances of the recurring cast Corey Bill (Pete Anderson) and Steve Coulter (Reg Monroe), as their characters die at the end of the episode. Plot One morning, Morgan Jones (Lennie James) brews coffee in his camp when a man (Benedict Samuel) with a \\"W\\" written in his forehead approaches and holds him at gunpoint. He explains that he and his group, the Wolves, are hunting down other survivors and eliminating them. Morgan offers his supplies in exchange for being let go, but the Wolf refuses. Morgan evades another Wolf's attempt to ambush him and knocks both of them out with his walking stick. In Alexandria, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) regains consciousness after being knocked out by Michonne (Danai Gurira) and is informed that Pete (Corey Brill) has been separated from Jessie (Alexandra Breckenridge), and Deanna Monroe (Tovah Feldshuh) is holding a forum to decide whether Rick should be exiled. Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) tries to talk Deanna out of it, but is unsuccessful. Rick later admits to Michonne that he and Carol (Melissa McBride) stole guns from the armory and tries to return the gun, but Michonne says she would not have stopped him, and that she knocked out Rick to protect him, not Alexandria. In the meantime, Carol visits Pete and asks him to check on Tara Chambler (Alanna Masterson), who is still wounded. When he refuses, Carol pulls a knife and threatens him, saying that she can get away with claiming self-defense. Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz) visits Tara and talks with Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt), and they apologize for things that happened on the road. Eventually, Tara wakes up while Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos) is watching her. Outside the walls, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) buries a group of walkers she had killed. However, still emotionally unstable, she goes into the grave and lies among the pile of corpses. Meanwhile, Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Aaron (Ross Marquand) see a survivor wearing a red poncho (Jason Alexander Davis) in the forest, but lose track of him, and decide to scavenge supplies from a food truck. However, they set off a trap that unleashes a horde of walkers and are forced to take shelter inside a car. Morgan arrives and Daryl and Aaron are able to escape. Aaron invites Morgan to Alexandria, but Morgan declines, asking instead for directions and shows them the map he picked up in the church. That night, the two Wolves Morgan previously encountered bring the survivor with the red poncho to the location, only to find their trap triggered, and they slit his throat. While resetting the trap, the Wolves find Aaron's dropped pack, containing evidence of Alexandria's existence. Elsewhere, Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) sees Nicholas (Michael Traynor) climbing over the wall and follows him into the woods. While tracking him, Glenn is shot and wounded by Nicholas. Glenn escapes and tackles Nicholas when his attention is focused on a lone walker. A struggle ensues and Nicholas runs off, leaving Glenn to defend himself against the walkers they attracted. As Nicholas moves through the night, Glenn catches up and holds him at gunpoint. Nicholas begs for his life, and Glenn reluctantly spares him. Later, Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) goes outside the walls, unarmed. He finds a walker eating a man and approaches, offering himself to the walker, but he ends up killing both the walker and the dying man. Upon returning to Alexandria, Gabriel leaves the front gate ajar. Sasha goes to the church and asks Gabriel for help, but he says he cannot help her. Sasha admits she wants to die, and Gabriel, in a fit of anger, blames Bob Stookey and Tyreese Williams's deaths on her sins. A struggle ensues and Sasha holds Gabriel at gunpoint. Gabriel tells her to shoot him but Maggie arrives and stops her. Maggie hears Gabriel's confession over letting his congregation die and helps him to his feet. On his way to the meeting, Rick notices the front gate open. He closes it and follows a trail of blood to find walkers amongst the houses. At the meeting, Michonne, Carol, Abraham, and Maggie speak in Rick's defense, while Deanna reveals Gabriel's claims. Rick arrives with a walker corpse, saying the walls alone are not enough to keep the residents safe. An inebriated Pete shows up wielding Michonne's katana, angrily proclaiming that Rick does not belong in Alexandria while attempting to assassinate him. Reg tries to stop Pete, but Pete shoves Reg away and accidentally slices open his throat with the katana, for which Abraham pins him down afterward. At Deanna's request, Rick executes Pete. He looks up to find that Daryl and Aaron have returned with Morgan, who all witnessed the execution. In a post-credits scene, Michonne contemplates mounting her katana back on the wall but decides to carry it. At the Wolves' trap, the red poncho survivor, now a walker, stumbles past the car in which Daryl and Aaron had taken shelter, upon which has been written \\"WOLVES NOT FAR\\". Production \\"Conquer\\" was co-written by executive producer and series showrunner Scott M. Gimple and co-executive producer Seth Hoffman. It was directed by executive producer and special make-up effects supervisor Greg Nicotero. The episode featured Lennie James as Morgan Jones prominently, his fifth guest appearance on the television series. It marks his third appearance in the fifth season, after two brief, post-credit cameo appearances in \\"No Sanctuary\\" and \\"Coda\\", which showed Morgan on the trail after leaving his base in the third season episode \\"Clear\\". A cover version of Brian Wilson's 1988 song \\"Love and Mercy\\" plays during one scene. It was recorded by Gazelle Twin specifically for the episode. Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode was watched by 15.8 million American viewers with an 18-49 rating of 8.2, an increase in viewership from the previous episode which had 13.757 million viewers with an 18-49 rating of 7.0. This made the episode the highest rated season finale in the show's history, beating last season's finale, which had a 7.6 18-49 rating. Including DVR viewership, the episode was watched by 21.43 million viewers with an 18-49 rating of 11.1. =Critical reception= The episode prominently featured Lennie James (pictured) as Morgan Jones in his fifth guest appearance on the television series as well as his integration into the main storyline. \\"Conquer\\" received critical acclaim. Critics praised the reintroduction of Lennie James as Morgan Jones into the main story. Other critics complimented the performances of James, as well as Andrew Lincoln and Tovah Feldshuh as well as the script. The scenes involving Seth Gilliam, Sonequa Martin-Green and Steven Yeun were noted as highlights. Greg Nicotero's direction was praised with many being complimentary of the shot of Sasha lying on a herd of walkers in a graveyard, as well as the scene involving Daryl and Aaron hiding in a car surrounded by hundreds of zombies. Den of Geek!s Ron Hogan said \\"Nicotero has been killing it, literally and figuratively, this season, and this brilliantly conceived movie-length episode is a testament to his abilities behind the camera.\\" He also felt the performances of the actors were a strong point in the episode, saying \\"everyone raises their game\\" as well as noting the series has \\"never been better\\" in its fifth season run. Some continued to assess the fifth season as the strongest. Varietys Laura Prudom called it \\"arguably [...] The Walking Deads best [season] yet, propelled by compulsive story threads and fascinating character dynamics\\" as she commented on the episode as a whole saying: \\"The weight of so many competing story arcs certainly brought a breathless quality to the finale ‚Äî similar to Game of Thrones and that blockbuster show‚Äôs sprawling ensemble, each character probably got a cumulative five minutes of screen time while showrunner Scott Gimple worked to tie up multiple loose ends.\\" She also declared that Morgan's presence dominated the episode. The Guardians Bryan Moylan declared it \\"a season finale that had everything.\\" He said: \\"In bravura style, this shocking season finale showed Rick confronting the people of Alexandria, and perfectly set up a very creepy season six.\\" He praised the ending with \\"the action [...] cutting between four life-or-death confrontations. Rick was fighting off the three zombies that had been let into Alexandria; Sasha was fending off Gabriel; Glenn was beating the snot out of Nicholas; and Carol, Michonne, and the rest of the group were defending Rick from Deanna.\\" He assessed \\"And that is what makes this show so great. It resolved all the storylines it had been juggling all season, but not without some moral and emotional ambiguity. And it took the time to direct us towards what we can expect when the show returns. There is resolution, but there is still impending doom. There is never any rest on The Walking Dead, and I can‚Äôt wait for its return. Erik Kain for Forbes praised the episode, inferring it to be unpredictable and \\"one of the most tense and anxious episodes of The Walking Dead\\". Both TheWrap and Us Weekly felt the season finale delivered an explosive and action packed climax.

HMS Unite captured her some two months later off Zara. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Roman. She served in the Mediterranean. She was sold in 1814. Capture Unite took shelter from a gale between 28 and 31 July 1808 under Lusin on the Dalmatian coast. Late in the afternoon of the 31st, near Premuda, she sighted three enemy naval brigs. Captain Campbell set out in chase and around 3am found himself with in two miles of two of the brigs. Suddenly he sighted he saw the third; Unite steered to pass by the third and while within pistol-shot, gave the brig a broadside, which caused the brig to surrender without a shot being fired, her crew having taken refuge below decks. Unite sent boats that secured the brig and then set out after her two companions. There was little wind so the brigs made use of their sweeps and it was only around 7a.m. that Unite was able to catch up with the larger, and more laggardly of the brigs. This vessel, seeing no chance to escape, fired a broadside, struck her colours, and ran onto the shore, where Unite took possession. The third brig escaped. The two captured brigs turned out to be Nettuno and Teuli√©, both of sixteen \\"Thirty-Two-Pounders, Brass Carronades\\", and 115 men each.

Representing two extremes of position on the topic and separated by a generation, the documentary featured conservative former Liberal party senator Nick Minchin and climate activist, founder of the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and author, Anna Rose as competing protagonists. They shared a \\"journey of mutual discovery\\" to see if they could change each other's mind about climate change, its causes and impacts. The one-hour long documentary was followed by a live studio audience discussion on the ABC TV program, Q&A.; The production was directed by Max Bourke, produced by Kate Hodges and Simon Nasht and partnered with ABC TV, Screen Australia and Screen NSW. The film attracted criticism from environmentalists and scientists who stated that climate change is not scientifically controversial, and that the format of the show was read \\"directly from the denialist strategic playbook.\\" Graham Redfearn said of the program: \\"If I were a climate sceptic activist or a fossil fuel lobbyist designing a format for a TV show, this show is what I‚Äôd probably come up with.\\" Simon Nasht defended the choice of format by saying \\"We set out to see who Nick relies on and who Anna relies on.

His body was discovered in the Tama River on Friday, February 20, 2015. On February 25, 2015, the police arrested three boys in relation with Uemura's murder. Two of the suspects told the police that the alleged ringleader was inspired by Jihadi John's killings. It is unclear whether any of the three arrested suspects was the ringleader. The same two suspects also provided details of the circumstances of Uemura's murder. Prior to his death, Uemura had apparently been refusing to commit crimes for a group of older boys with whom he spent time, and wanted to cut ties with them. At the time of his death, his mother was working as a nurse to support her children. Victim Uemura was well known among his friends as a cheerful boy. When he stopped going to school, his teacher called his parents to see if anything was wrong. After his parents divorced, his mother raised him and his four siblings.  Crime  Ryota Uemura was found dead on the banks of the Tama River on February 20, 2015. His neck had been repeatedly hacked at, apparently using a blood-soaked knife that was discovered nearby, after he was repeatedly forced by a gang of three local teens to swim on the freezing day. The same morning, the partly burned remnants of Uemura‚Äôs clothing were found in a nearby park toilet, in what appeared to be an effort to destroy evidence. The boy‚Äôs cellphone was missing. During the police investigation, the boy deemed the ring leader admitted to killing Uemura with a box cutter and another boy said he stabbed him at the leader‚Äôs direction, according to the police. A total of 43 knife wounds were inflicted on Uemura‚Äôs body, including 31 to the neck during the assault, which lasted more than an hour. Populist weekly Shukan Shincho reported the wounds appeared to indicate that whoever killed Ryota may have been trying to decapitate him. ‚ÄúSome investigators suspect (the criminals) watched Internet videos showing the execution of hostages by Islamic State (IS) fighters and sought to mimic them,‚Äù the magazine said, quoting an unnamed source close to police.  Prosecution  On 27 February 2015, an 18-year-old boy was arrested by Kanagawa Police on suspicion of murder. The teenager's name has not been released because he was legally a minor. Police have also obtained arrest warrants for two other teenagers. Local media reports suggest Ryota knew the suspects and had been attacked by them in the past. On March 19, 2015, the prosecutors sent the three to the Yokohama Family Court. In closed-door juvenile trial sessions at the court, the 18-year-old boy who is considered the ring leader admitted to killing Uemura, while the two others maintained their innocence, according to the sources. On 13 May 2015, the Court decided to send the three teenagers back to the prosecutors, with sources at the Yokohama District Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office stating that the trio may be tried as adults depending on the prosecutors' next move. On February 10, 2016, the Yokohama District Court on Wednesday handed down a sentence of nine to 13 years in prison to 19-year- old, Funahashi Ryuichi, for playing a key role in the murder of 13 year old, Ryota Uemura, on a riverbank in Kawasaki, southwest of Tokyo, last year. In giving the so-called indeterminate sentence as stipulated under Juvenile Law, Presiding Judge Hiroko Kondo highlighted the cruelty of the way Ryota Uemura was assaulted and killed by Funahashi, who had previously been a part of the same peer group. ‚ÄúThe victim‚Äôs neck was slashed more than once and he was forced to swim in the river in the middle of winter. This was just so appalling and the cruelty (of the case) stands out,‚Äù the judge said. She also determined that Funhashi ‚Äúbore the heaviest responsibility‚Äù for playing a leading role. Funahashi had pleaded guilty to the charges in his trial, determined by a panel of professional and citizen judges. Prosecutors had demanded a sentence of 10 to 15 years in prison saying he played the leading role in the murder, while his defense counsel pleaded for five to 10 years, citing the possibility of reformation. The defense counsel also insisted that Funahashi did not have ‚Äúa strong intention to kill,‚Äù but the judge rejected the argument, saying, ‚Äúhe continued to attack the victim with the accomplices until the victim died.‚Äù The judge, however, said the defendant‚Äôs ‚Äúimmaturity‚Äù of allowing violence can largely be attributed to the environment he was brought up in and that warrants lessening his responsibility. On March 14, 2016, The Yokohama District Court on Monday sentenced the second boy, 18-year- old at the time, to between four and six and a half years in prison for his part. Reaction Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe expressed his condolences to the victim's family and vowed that Japan should not have another similar tragedy. It was the third shocking incident in 2015, after a 19-year-old college student killed 77-year-old Tomoko Mori. On March 5, 2015, after Uemura's mother released statements about her son's death, the three boys previously arrested were charged with murder.

The film addresses questions about life and existence. It was released to theaters May 11, 1990, and aired on PBS on August 6, 1991. Plot The film opens in a fine restaurant with Toback meeting with a Hollywood producer, pitching him the idea for a movie. He says there will be no script, no actors, and no story. It will be a movie ‚Äúabout the people who are in it‚Ä¶about creation and disintegration, God, life, love, sex, crime, madness, death, everything.‚Äù The restaurant scene \\"nods at My Dinner With Andre, the classic model of a raconteur's film.‚Äù Toback tells the producer that the idea was inspired by his epiphany that the origin of the cosmos was an ‚Äúorgasmic explosion of God.‚Äù The producer expresses skepticism and reluctance to finance the project. The film begins to introduce the interview subjects, about 20 individuals who are only identified by their professions‚Äîthe Astronomer, the Medical Student, the Filmmaker, the Gangster, the Girl, the Humorist, the Writer, the Restauranteuse, the Survivor, and so on. Their introductions are interspersed by the ongoing pitch between the director and the executive. The Astronomer discusses the creation of the universe with a singularity, the Big Bang, and the development of the stars and galaxies. Toback then asks each of the individuals how they believe the universe was created. Some have no idea. The Humorist believes there must have always been something, rejecting the ideas of nothingness and infinity. The Gangster says \\"I have no idea. You‚Äôd have to ask my brother the priest.\\" The Girl says it began with \\"a piece of dust and then there was a squirrel. Then there was a dog. Then there was a cat....\\" Toback continues with questions about love and sex. \\"The responses run the gamut from earnest to flippant, some are quite profound.\\" Some answer more confidently than others. When Toback asks each of them if they believe in God, many say yes, others aren‚Äôt so sure. The Writer provides the most unusual answer, saying, \\"I've seen him too many times to believe in him. The last time was in Baltimore, in a hotel. He was in the lobby, arguing about the size of his room.\\" \\"Toback, too, reveals himself in the process of asking his questions, poking fun, in his encounter with the Model (Sheila Kennedy), at his image as a lothario by lounging provocatively close to his attractive subject.\\" As the film continues, some of the interview subjects are identified. The Restauranteuse is Elaine Kaufman, the owner of Elaine's in New York City, the long-time famous dining spot for celebrities. The Filmmaker identifies himself as Don Simpson, producer of Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, and Top Gun. Toback begins to ask more poignant questions as the film moves along, which prompts some of the subjects to become more pensive. They begin to reveal more of themselves as the questions continue, especially in response to questions about death, madness, and whether they would kill someone. Some of the individuals stand out for their painfully honest and sometimes troubling answers. Among them is the Gangster. He tells of his violent history, how he \\"gave a lot of guys beatings,\\" how he was shot on the steps of a church by rival gang members as a kid, the love and insane jealousy he experienced for a woman and for whom he left his wife and children. He discusses his time in prison and his distant relationship with family members. There is a bright spot for the gangster. He is grateful for the year he spent with father as he was dying of a prolonged illness. Toback asks if he would kill a complete stranger for a million dollars. The Gangster pauses for several seconds before answering that he would not. When the director presses and asks why not, the Gangster searches for an answer and replies, \\"I don't need the money.\\" In an interesting glimpse into the future of art imitating life, we learn that the gangster is Gennaro Anthony Sirico, Jr. and goes by Tony Sirico. Ten years after the film, he would become famous for portraying Paulie Gualtieri in the HBO series The Sopranos. The most poignant moments of the film are with the Survivor, a Jewish Hungarian woman who survived the death camps of World War II. She describes how as a young girl she and her mother were sent via train in a cattle car, packed with others, to Auschwitz where her sense of identity was erased. While at the camp, she and her mother were brought into a room with three other women. Dr. Josef Mengele entered the room. The Survivor describes him as evil incarnate, the Angel of Death. He separated the Survivor from her mother. When the Survivor asked a fellow woman prisoner where her mother is days later, the woman pointed to the black smoke of a chimney and said, \\"there she goes.\\" The Survivor says, however, that her being a \\"mother and functioning to the best of her abilities means that Hitler didn't succeed.\\" Toback asks each of the subjects how the world will end and if they are concerned about it. The Gangster says, \\"it's the last thing on my mind\\" and that it doesn't frighten him at all. He's more afraid of being alone. The Astronomer tells us the end of life on Earth will be the result of our sun running out of fuel. The writer says the world will end at the turn of the 21st century with his death. The film ends where it began, in the restaurant with the director and producer continuing their discussion about financing it. The producer appears perplexed by the premise of such a movie and asks who will pay money to see it. Cinematography and sets The cinematography changes with the interview subjects. For some individuals, such as the Philosopher, a formal office was used with a steady shot. For the Model, a plush sofa in a living room was used with sweeping crane movements of the camera. For the Gangster, a brightly lit room was used with the camera close in, showing only parts of his face. Wide shots were used for others or dim lighting for some, showing only one side of the subject's face. Music The music changes to match the mood of the director's questions. With more exciting topics such as sex being discussed, a violin caprice by Niccol√≤ Paganini is played. During the more somber moments, a slow piano prelude by Johann Sebastian Bach is performed. Reception Despite its thought provoking questions, the film had mixed reviews. ‚ÄúWhat kind of people want to reveal their most profound thoughts and fears on screen?, asked Caryn James of the New York Times. ‚ÄúAs it turns out, people who ultimately say very little, who are at best amusing, occasionally affecting and more often simply bland.‚Äù Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, ‚ÄúThe startling thing about James Toback‚Äôs documentary The Big Bang is how much fun it is.‚Äù He added, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a refreshing change of pace, both from Toback‚Äôs other movies and from the lockstep commercialism of today‚Äôs Hollywood. It deserves to be seen, and savored.‚Äù Roger Ebert gave it three of four stars. He wrote ‚ÄúThe Big Bang may be a sketch when a mural is called for, but it is a challenging sketch, the kind of movie that you want to see with a friend, and then sit down afterward for a good, long talk.‚Äù Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an 80% based on 5 reviews.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/big_bang IMDB reviewers give it a rating of 6 out of 10.

A German count, he was appointed by the Emperor Henry V after the death of the Marchioness Matilda of Tuscany (1115) in order to break the practice of hereditary succession in the Tuscan marquisate. He was a much weaker ruler than his predecessor, unable to dominate the many disparate forces opposed to direct imperial (or German) rule. This weakness is often associated with the rise of autonomous city government in Florence. In a document of 11 September 1116, Rabodo is called \\"marquis of Tuscany owing to imperial largesse\\", but in one dated to 1119 he is said to rule \\"by God's grace\\", using the same formula used by Matilda. He moved the Tuscan capital from Florence, where it had been since 1057, to the fortified town of San Miniato al Tedesco, thereafter the seat of the imperial vicars into the 13th century. He brought with him a German entourage, referenced with contempt in many contemporary documents merely as the Teutonici (Germans). In 1116 Rabodo pledged the castle of Bientina to Archbishop Pietro Moriconi of Pisa and the Pisan judge (iudex) and operator (operarius) Ildebrando. This pledge was witnessed by four consuls of the commune of the city of Pisa. Rabodo disputed the jurisdictional claims of the commune of Florence and established an alliance with the city's rivals, the Alberti counts. He took the castle of Monte Cascioli, which was coveted by the Alberti, from the Florentines in 1119. The Florentines assaulted the castle twice, and Rabodo was killed defending it. The castle was burnt to the ground. His successor, Conrad of Scheyern, another German, was in office by 1120.

The Black Eyed Peas performed a medley of their greatest hits: \\"I Gotta Feeling\\", \\"Boom Boom Pow\\", \\"Pump It\\", \\"The Time (Dirty Bit)\\", \\"Let's Get It Started\\", and \\"Where Is the Love?\\" Slash made a guest appearance, performing \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\" with Fergie, while Usher made an appearance to perform his song \\"OMG\\" with will.i.am.Stengle, Jamie (February 4, 2011). Background A country music halftime show was originally in the planning stages before the Black Eyed Peas agreed to perform. After months of speculation, the selection of The Black Eyed Peas was announced on November 25, 2010. The choice of The Black Eyed Peas was intended to bring youth back into the halftime show, after the NFL had booked legacy artists in the years following the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show and its controversy. Development The show also displayed a long list of other performers, including Prairie View A&M; University's \\"Marching Storm\\" Band. The performance experienced some audio issues. =Fashion= Members of the Black Eyed Peas each wore outfits that were unique from one another's. However, they coordinated there look, with each having a futuristic black-colored outfit. Fergie wore an LED-embedded costume designed by Anouk Wipprecht and B. Akerlund. Her shoes, on which Wipprecht collaborated with Dutch shoemaker Rene van den Berg, were integrated with Luminex, a light-emitting synthetic fiber. The outfit had a leather skirt and a belt studded with many Swarovski crystals. A football-inspired chest-piece design with flashing LEDs was engineered by Tom Talmon for the outfit. Taboo's outfit featured a digital chest plate that switched images to match what song was being performed, for instance, displaying a red heart shape during the performance of \\"Where Is The Love?\\". will.i.am's outfit was accessorized with a transparent skullcap. Slash wore a top hat, a signature look of his. The top hat he wore was sequined. The show's sizable group of dancers wore LED costumes which could be illuminated various colors. Some in the media likened the visual effect of the illuminated dancers to the visuals of the Tron franchise. Synopsis Halftime show The show began with the four members of the Black Eyed Peas (will.i.am, Fergie, apl.de.ap, and Taboo) descending via cables onto the stage. The Black Eyed Peas started their performance with \\"I Gotta Feeling\\". The Black Eyed Peas then began their second song, \\"Boom Boom Pow\\". Dancers on the field, in costumes which glowed, arranged themselves into shape formations such as arrows and a giant eye. During the performance of \\"Boom Boom Pow\\", the dancers costumes were illuminated in green. \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" transitioned into \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\", with the two songs briefly overlapping. Slash then rose onto the stage, with Will.i.am. introducing him, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Slash.\\" Fergie then joined Slash, singing the lyrics to \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\". For the performance of \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\", the dancers' costumes were illuminated in red. This was followed by renditions of \\"Pump It\\" and \\"Let's Get It Started\\". Usher then descended onto the stage in a manner similar to how The Black Eyed Peas had originally entered. He performed \\"OMG\\" with will.i.am. Stage arranged to spell the word \\"love\\" The stage, which consisted of several moving platforms and was illuminated by many lights, was then rearranged to spell the word \\"love\\". Fergie declared, ‚ÄúSuper Bowl XLV, show us some love,\\" before The Black Eyed Peas launch into the song \\"Where Is the Love?\\". The performance then ended with the song \\"The Time (Dirty Bit)\\". Critical reception The performance received a negative critical reception. Vince Cestone of Bleacher Report called the performance \\"uninspiring,\\" and wrote that \\"The Black Eyed Peas were pathetic‚Äîor mediocre at best.\\" However, he praised the visual effects of the performance as \\"impressive\\". JP Starkey of SB Nation Dallas wrote, \\"It wasn't entertaining, it wasn't fun, the songs were brutally bad and didn't translate to a live setting whatsoever.\\" Paul Cashmere of Undercover.fm called the performance \\"hideous\\". Nekesa Mumbi Moody of the Associated Press declared, \\"The Black Eyed Peas brought the youth, but little else,\\" but praised Usher's part of the performance as a \\"brief exhilarating moment\\". Ben Werner of the Orange County Register called the performance a \\"glittering bore\\". A national viewer poll conducted by ESPN found that 35% (a plurality) of respondents graded the performance an \\"F\\". When reviewing the Super Bowl XVII halftime show in 2013, the Associated Press' Mesfin Fekadu retrospectively called the Black Eyed Peas' performance \\"disastrous\\".

The single-span Burr Arch covered bridge structure was built by Henry Wolf in either 1854 or 1859 and destroyed in the Great Flood of 1913. History =Construction= The bridge was originally built by Henry Wolf on the Plank Road, that had been constructed between Rockville and Bellmore around 1850. The Plank Road was a toll road that would stretch from Indianapolis, in the east, to the Wabash River, in the west. However, the planking didn't hold up and they soon started to rot. The boards were removed and the road was graveled. In 1867 or 1877 the Parke County Commissioners bought the companies stock and opened the road as a free road. =Repairs and Destruction= The bridge would suffer from damaging flood a couple of times in its life before finally succumbing to the Great Flood of 1913, which would go on to claim several bridges in Parke County. The first record is that J.J. Daniels had to make repairs in 1863 to the bridge. Again, in 1875, flood waters damaged the east abutment this time which would require $900 in repairs. After being damaged in the 1913 flood it was replaced with the Howard Covered Bridge.

Initiative 59 was a 1998 Washington, D.C. voter-approved ballot initiative that sought to legalize medical cannabis. The short title of the initiative was \\"Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1998\\". Though the initiative passed with 69% of the vote in November 1998, its implementation was delayed by Congress's passage of the Barr Amendment, which prohibited DC from using its funds in support of the program. This Amendment delayed the start of the medical marijuana program until it was effectively overturned in 2009, with the first DC customer legally purchasing medical cannabis at a dispensary in the District in 2013. Barr Amendment Georgia Congressman Bob Barr advocated complete federal prohibition of medical marijuana. In 1998, he successfully blocked implementation of Initiative 59 ‚Äì the \\"Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Treatment Initiative of 1998\\" ‚Äì which would have legalized medical marijuana in Washington, D.C. The \\"Barr Amendment\\" to the 1999 Omnibus spending bill not only blocked implementation of Initiative 59, but also prohibited the vote tally from even being released. Nearly a year passed before a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union eventually revealed the initiative had received 69 percent of the vote. In response to the judge's ruling, Barr simply attached another \\"Barr Amendment\\" to the 2000 Omnibus spending bill that overturned Initiative 59 outright. The Barr Amendment also prohibited future laws that would \\"decrease the penalties for marijuana or other Schedule I drugs\\" in Washington, D.C. This preemptively blocked future attempts by Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) to reform marijuana laws in DC via the initiative process. In March 2002, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan struck down this portion of the Barr Amendment as being an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. Barr's response to the ruling was defiant: The federal government later prevailed on appeal, reinstating the Barr Amendment just in time to thwart MPP's initiative 63 ‚Äì \\"The Medical Marijuana Initiative of 2002\\" ‚Äì which had already qualified for the November 2002 ballot. In 2009, both the United States Senate and House of Representatives voted to lift the ban against a medical marijuana initiative, effectively overturning the Barr Amendment.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) agreed to transfer large quantities of irrigation water to the San Diego County Water Authority while providing a pathway for the state of California to restore the Salton Sea. According to the IID, \\"The Quantification Settlement Agreement and Related Agreements are a set of inter-related contracts that settle certain disputes among the United States, the State of California, IID, Metropolitan Water District, Coachella Valley Water District and the San Diego County Water Authority.\\" The implementation of the agreement has been controversial, as critics have argued that the agreement was passed without proper environmental review. The impact on the surrounding environment has been cited by opponents, who argue that the policies of the agreement are severely damaging the Salton Sea and Colorado River. In addition, a protracted drought affecting the state of California has complicated the debate about effective water control policies. Prior to the agreement, there was comparatively little environmental impact on the ecologically fragile Salton Sea. If upheld by the courts, the conditions will remain in force for up to 75 years. Background Dry Bed of Colorado River Below Imperial Intake, circa 1905 Starting in 1901, farmers in the Imperial Valley were using the Colorado River for irrigation water, with drainage water going to a very small Salton Sea. The surrounding ecosystem changed somewhat rapidly, and \\"by 1929, the combination of evaporation and agricultural drainage water increased the Sea's salinity, eliminating most of the fresh water fish species.\\" In addition to fish, migratory birds have long inhabited the region, and there is concern that pollutants are damaging the population. Most notably, \\"salt, selenium and pesticides are carried into the sea with agricultural return flows, which originates largely from Imperial Valley farms.\\" With the post-World War II population growth in Southern California, there has been an increasing demand for water sources to supply both urban and existing agricultural areas. The Colorado River currently supplies approximately a quarter of the water for these areas. Along with increased water demand, a protracted drought throughout the state has complicated the debate about effective water control and usage policies. In 2003, California suffered from an extended drought, and there was considerable discussion and debate about how much water each water district was entitled to receive from the Colorado River and its tributaries. As a result, several organizations negotiated an agreement for water rights for their associated districts: the San Diego County Water Authority, the Coachella Valley Water District, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The agreement was a compromise that divided available water resources between the environmentally fragile Imperial Valley and the more heavily populated areas of Southern California. Among California agricultural regions, the Imperial Valley uses a substantial portion of the Colorado River water that is allotted to the state each year. Approximately 3.1 million of the 4.4 million acre feet of water the state receives annually from the Colorado River is used by the Imperial Irrigation District. According to the Imperial Irrigation District, \\"As a result of the QSA, California can creatively stretch its limited Colorado River resource by allowing urban areas to fund water conservation efforts in the Imperial Valley in exchange for use of the conserved water.\\" Much attention has been paid to the impact of the Quantification Settlement Agreement on the Salton Sea, and Wired Magazine notes that \\"Considered to be among the world's most vital avian habitats and-until recently-one of its most productive fisheries, the Salton Sea is in a state of wild flux.\\" At one time a thriving ecosystem formed following an irrigation accident in 1905, the Salton Sea has increasingly faced higher levels of salinity in addition to shrinking water volume. The Quantification Settlement Agreement intended to provide a pathway for restoring this ecosystem. In addition to the purported environmental benefits, the Quantification Settlement Agreement is of particular importance to the Imperial Valley region due to the economic conditions of the area. In a recent article for the New Yorker, Dana Goodyear noted that \\"The deal gives Imperial billions of dollars to spend on improving efficiency on its farms and its irrigation infrastructure, which in some parts is primitive.\\" Some potential improvements to this system include the installation of improved pumping systems and more durable canal infrastructure. Implementation The All-American Canal lining project was completed in April 2010 as part of the QSA conservation efforts. Although the agreement went into effect in 2003, it was almost immediately challenged by groups of local farmers and environmentalists. Despite these challenges, the water transfers outlined in the agreement started on time and canal lining conservation projects have been completed. The Coachella Canal lining project was completed in 2006, and the All-American Canal lining project finished in 2010, conserving 93,700 acre-feet of water per year. While those conservation numbers are important to the agreement, the total amount of water transferred to the water authorities is set to increase significantly in 2018. The Imperial Irrigation District faced significant criticism in 2012 when it was reported that it was not conserving as much water as stipulated under the Quantification Settlement Agreement. The Imperial Irrigation District is required to deliver its water quota through conservation, rather than delivery from existing sources. Some have noted that this would be difficult for a rural region that depends heavily on water for irrigation purposes. One of the most comprehensive summaries of the implementation process has been written by the Colorado Foundation for Water Education. They note that \\"The first benchmark, set for December 31, 2002, required the California water agencies to enter into a Quantification Settlement Agreement.\\" The same group notes that the Secretary of the Interior determined in July 2003 that the Imperial Irrigation District, which also has authority over the water supply for the Salton Sea, was wasting 300,000 acre-feet of water per year and threatened to remove that allotment without compensation under the QSA. The agreement has been associated with a large degree of litigation, with numerous parties and organizations filing motions in California state courts. As of December 8, 2011, the California Court of Appeal for the Third District has ruled in favor of the major state and federal water authorities, and determined that the Quantification Settlement Agreement does not violate the California Constitution. Opponents also argued that the Agreement violated the state's Clean Air Act, but this claim was rejected as well. In July 2013, the Sacramento Superior Court entered a final judgment upholding the agreement and dismissing all current challenges, but the San Diego County Water Authority still anticipates another round of appeals. Supporters Most of the support for the Quantification Settlement Agreement has been associated with government agencies, on both the state and federal level. Numerous government agencies produced press releases that touted the benefits of the agreement. Many of these releases noted that this was the largest water transfer agreement in American history. Although residents of the Imperial Valley have been the main opponents of this measure, some observers have embraced the agreement, arguing that it is the most realistic and pragmatic solution to the water crisis in the area. Brad Jennings, a tentative supporter of the agreement, notes that \\"There are things most agree on: The Salton Sea must be saved. No matter how you feel about water transfers you know that a dead Sea would be an environmental disaster for us. And our water rights and water allotment must be protected. That means we may have to give some up, which is what the QSA was designed to do.\\" He also argued that the measure would likely prevent federal intervention, a concern of many residents of the Imperial Valley. In addition, the Colorado Foundation for Water Education, an educational and professional development organization, has written positively about the agreement. In an article, Jim Lochhead notes that \\"By forcing California to live within its means, the QSA provides reassurance that our ability to develop water in the Colorado River Basin is for the time being, secure.\\" The CFWE is based in Denver and has a different perspective of the QSA due to the importance of the Colorado River outside of California. There has been significant discussion about the human impact on water supplies in California, with criticism of the unrestrained population growth particularly in Southern California. The State of California has connected the Quantification Settlement Agreement to the Salton Sea crisis, and has attempted to highlight the planned environmental restoration benefits of the compact. According to the California Department of Water Resources, the major elements of the Salton Sea Restoration Plan include: water management infrastructure, habitat restoration, water quality management, and air quality management. Opponents Drowned trees in the dry bed of the Salton Sea Opposition to the agreement has been centered with two main groups: Protect Our Water and Environmental Rights (POWER), an environmental organization, and local farmers from the Imperial Valley. POWER has argued for traditional methods of water conservation, such as reuse and recycling in urban areas in place of a transfer of water from the Salton Sea. The salinity of the lake has increased substantially, and conservationists argue that this has damaged the surrounding ecosystem. Restoration efforts have been championed by local politicians, as the Salton Sea is prominent for being the largest man-made lake in California. Along with environmentalists and farmers, local journalists have noted the negative effects that the QSA may have on the communities in the Salton Sea vicinity. In an article in the Desert Sun, Colt Stewart notes that \\"We are told the price to manage the death or shrinking of the sea is too high. Estimates range from $3 billion to $9 billion.\\" Stewart compared this to the much larger $60 billion high speed rail project the state has approved, and is critical of the government's priorities. He also argues that \\"we can't solve this problem with tired old thinking based on the concept of a virtually free and seemingly limitless supply of clean, fresh surface and ground water\\", tying the QSA to the larger water shortage crisis the state faces. Other opposition arguments include poor conduct of the parties involved in litigation and the seeming lack of commitment to restoring the Salton Sea. Elizabeth Varen, in an article for the Imperial Valley Press, noted that Judge Ronald B. Robie refused to recuse himself as the environmental group POWER fought the QSA in court. Other media outlets have voiced their opposition as well. Wired Magazine asserts that \\"the deal allots virtually no water to the Salton Sea\\" and also notes that efforts to deliver mitigation water have been impeded. Future While the current round of legal questions have been settled in the courts, controversy about the effects of the agreement has increased in 2015. The Coachella Valley Water District and the Imperial Irrigation District have disputed a petition filed by the latter organization that calls for the state and other authorities to restore the ecological stability of the Salton Sea. As of April 2015, a state task force has agreed to examine the petition and potentially respond to the ecological concerns cited. An envoy from the Imperial Irrigation District is discussing the petition with the state government, as there have been concerns that the state's promises to assist the IID in providing mitigation water to the Salton Sea region have been vague and unfulfilled. The QSA required the state to identify a Salton Sea restoration plan and include funding, though nothing has yet been approved. Imperial Irrigation District officials have asserted that they would never have agreed to the QSA without assistance from other government agencies. In an article dating from January 2015, the local Desert Sun newspaper noted that the decrease in water provided to the Imperial Valley from the Colorado River \\"will leave growing stretches of lakebed exposed to the desert winds, sending more dust wafting through an area that already has high rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses.\\" 2015 California water crisis The Quantification Settlement Agreement and the Salton Sea restoration have increasingly been discussed within the larger framework of the California water crisis in 2015. The use of water for agricultural purposes has been discussed and debated, as approximately 80% of all California water use can be attributed to agricultural needs, most notably in the Central Valley and the rural areas of Imperial County. However, there are indications that Californians are aware of this crisis, and Los Angeles Times reporter Jay Famligietti noted that \\"A recent Field Poll showed that 94% of Californians surveyed believe that the drought is serious, and that one-third support mandatory rationing.\\" Reflecting these concerns, California Governor Jerry Brown announced new restrictions on water use in the state in 2015. These restrictions, delivered in an executive order, \\"directed the State Water Resources Control Board to impose a 25% reduction on the state's 400 local water supply agencies, which serve 90% of all California residents, over the coming year.\\" It remains to be seen how this will affect the Quantification Settlement Agreement, as well as the environmental future of the Salton Sea.

Boeing is the primary contractor for the IDAs and the adapters were assembled at their Houston Product Support Center. Parts from subcontractors came from 25 American states and the primary structure is from Russian company RSC Energia. Deployment of IDA modules When each IDA arrives, Dextre removes it from Dragon's trunk and moves it to about from the front of the PMA. It then moves the IDA carefully into position until it is seated on the PMA and holds it there. Astronauts during an Extravehicular activity then complete the electrical connections and permanently connect it to the PMA. IDA-1 was planned to be attached to Node-2's forward PMA. IDA-2 was originally planned to be attached to Node-2's zenith PMA. But following the loss of IDA-1, IDA-2 was instead attached to Node-2's forward PMA (PMA-2). IDA-3, a replacement for IDA-1, is installed at Node-2's zenith PMA (PMA-3). =IDA-1= IDA-1 with thermal insulation In February 2015, IDA-1 had been transported to the Kennedy Space Center while IDA-2 was still at Boeing's Houston facility.

The drama aired from 12 July 2014 to 20 September 2014 with a total of 10 episodes.  Plot  Naoya Inaba, who spends the majority of his adolescence abroad, returns to his hometown for his third year of high school. He enrolls in Saku High, which he admires thanks to one of its graduates, Yoshio Kurosawa, a yankee (20th century Japanese delinquent) who saved him from bullies and who encouraged him to never give up in pursuit of his dreams. However, to his dismay, he finds out that Saku High is inhabited by low-lives who resign to being underdogs in the town, and the school itself is about to be closed due to a lack of popularity. Naoya determines to resurrect the spirit of old Saku High by creating a water polo club to compete with Suiran High, a private rival high school whose successful water polo team brings the town out of obscurity. Needing seven members to start the club, Naoya builds friendship with the playful trio Tomoki Kimura, Kohei Shimura, and Shinsuke Kato, the pessimistic but good water polo player Ryuji Mifune, as well as the wild Ryo Chiaki and his friend Koki Miyaguchi. He is assisted by the school math teacher Chiharu Aoyama for advisory purposes. Naoya also gets emotional support from his childhood friend, Nagisa Iwasaki despite her being associated with Suiran High's water polo team, who grows to accept the current Naoya after her initial disappointment of seeing him changing into a yankee. Slowly, Naoya learns about the team's problems and bring them from their sulking with a determination to beat Suiran High, whose water polo team is aced by Torao Kitajima, a frenemy of Ryuji who strives to beat the latter to win the heart of Rei Fujisaki, despite the fact that Rei is unconditionally in love with him. Later, Naoya also reunites with Kurosawa, but his expectation is temporarily stripped when he learns that Kurosawa has given up his pride on Saku High. During the Inter-High tournament against Suiran High, Naoya overcomes an injury brought upon by a member of Suiran High and manages to score his team's victory. After the match, Naoya confesses his feelings to Nagisa, who accepts. The epilogue, narrated in a letter from Nagisa to Suiran High's water polo teams' adviser, Mayu Shoji, tells of the events happening after the Inter-High tournament: Saku High is successfully prevented from being closed and its water polo team continues to thrive; Ryuji competes for the national championship team thanks to his performance in the Inter-High tournament; while Kurosawa has regained his faith in Saku High and is training to be its teacher. The series ends with Naoya saving a boy from bullies and advising him never to give up, just as Kurosawa has done to him years before.  Cast  * Yuto Nakajima as : The series' main protagonist, Naoya is a 20th century-era delinquent (known as yankee in Japan) who enrolls in Saku High School due to his admiration of a yankee graduate, Kurosawa, who once saved him from bullies and encouraged him to never give up in his dreams, only to find out that the school now exhibits low-lives who resign to them being the underdogs to Suiran High School, a prestigious private rival school. Determined to keep Saku High from being closed, Naoya decides to create a water polo team to compete against Suiran's own. * Kento Yamazaki as : A pessimistic student of Saku High who is secretly a water polo prodigy. Due to losing out to Torao on a personal water polo match while in middle school, Ryuji declined Suiran High's invitation to join their water polo club and distanced himself from the sports altogether. He is encouraged by his friends to play the sports again and later joins Saku High's water polo team to compete and win against Torao. Ryuji is in love with Nagisa and plans to confess to her if Saku High wins the Inter-High tournament against Suiran High; however, when Naoya's own confession to Nagisa is accepted, he backs out for their sake. * Yuya Takaki as : The ace of Suiran High's male water polo team whom Naoya and Ryuji both make rivals with. He especially wants to win against Ryuji to finally get Rei's heart, as he believes that Rei is still attracted to Ryuji since their middle school times, despite the fact that Rei never actually loves Ryuji. Though he at first acts like a typical bully to Saku High, Torao shows a softer side as the series goes on as he calms down Nagisa in her rage against Goda for framing Naoya up for expulsion, and objects to using foul means to win against Saku High. * Yudai Chiba as : A student of Saku High and, together with Kohei and Shinsuke, a huge fan of idol Kanna Hashimoto. At first, he resigns for having to enroll in the underdog school of the town and is the most resistant to the idea that Saku High can beat Suiran High. However, when Naoto fights his way to obtain Kanna's autograph and bracelet for the trio, Tomoki relents and agrees to join Saku High's water polo team. Tomoki has a crush on Nagisa, but chooses to give up his feelings upon finding out that Nagisa is more attracted to Ryuji. * Taishi Nakagawa as : A member of Saku High's water polo team and best friend of Tomoki and Shinsuke. He is also a big fan of Kanna Hashimoto. When he joins up the Saku High's water polo team, he is the only one out of the seven who cannot swim and thus has to endure a separate training in the water before the team can properly play. Nevertheless, Kohei's determination to swim despite his inability is what seals Ryuji's decision to return back to the water polo world and join Saku High's water polo team. * Ryo Yoshizawa as : A member of Saku High's water polo team and part of the trio consisting of himself, Kohei, and Tomoki, who adores idol Kanna Hashimoto, though he is comparatively more calmed down and reserved than the two. He has an older brother who owns a restaurant that the water polo team and Nagisa frequent during their spare time. * Shotaro Mamiya as : A wild student of Saku High and best friend of Koki. He has a crush on his teacher Chiharu, but is genuinely more attracted to Ryoko, a Suiran High student he saves from being harmed by a Naoya impostor. During middle school, Chiaki was more introverted and was often bullied by Goda, but later stood up when Goda bullied Koki and promised to him that he will get stronger. He and Koki are Naoya's first recruits in Saku High's water polo team, with Chiaki determining to win against Goda. * Yuma Yamoto as : A member of Saku High's water polo team and Chiaki's best friend. Koki admired Chiaki ever since the latter stood up for him when he was bullied by Goda and is surprised when he learned that the two attended the same school. Despite thinking that Chiaki has forgotten their first meeting, it is later shown to be not the case. In the epilogue, it is shown that Koki is dating Riko, which Nagisa describes as an \\"unexpected pairing\\". * Sakurako Ohara as : Naoya's childhood friend who enrolls in Suiran High and serves as an aide to their water polo teams. She once played water polo, but quitted after realizing that she would never get a big break. She yearns for Naoya's return from overseas and is disappointed when she learns that he has become a yankee, but as the two live together, the two slowly rekindle their relationship. Though she believes herself to be in love with Ryuji, she realizes that Naoya has always been her foremost love. * Aya Oomasa as : Saku High's math teacher who later becomes the adviser of the school's water polo team. At first, she doubts the team's ability to run against Suiran High, but is convinced by the principal to believe in them. When she was in middle school, she was one of the witnesses of Kurosawa saving Naoya from bullies, which motivated her to apply for a teaching position at Saku High. * Yua Shinkawa as : A member of Suiran High's female water polo team and Torao's girlfriend. She is friends with both Torao and Ryuji since middle school, but is disappointed when Ryuji decided to quit the water polo scene after losing out to Torao. She brights up again when Ryuji makes a comeback, though despite Torao's misgivings, Rei has never been in love with Ryuji. *Nobuyuki Suzuki as : A member of Suiran High's male water polo team. He frequently bullies Saku High and does not like the fact that they have formed a water polo team since Naoya's arrival, which ignites his hatred for Naoya. Due to this, he frames up Naoya on a vandalizing incident that almost expels him from Saku High, and, under Shoji's tip, injures Naoya's left shoulder just before the Inter-High tournament to make him more exposed against Suiran High. * Hinako Sano as : An aide of Suiran High's water polo teams, together with her upperclassman Nagisa. She is in love with Naoya, but regretfully gives up her feelings for Nagisa's sake. The epilogue reveals that Riko is dating Koki. * Miwako Kakei as : A member of Suiran High's female water polo team. At first, Ryoko joins with her fellow Suiran High students in bullying Saku High, but mellows out after finding out that Goda is bribing a gangster into framing up Naoya for a vandalism. She gives the evidence that saves Naoya, and later becomes close to Chiaki, whom she successfully confesses to before the Inter-High tournament. * Kana Kurashina as : The iron-hearted adviser of Suiran High's water polo teams. Her coldness came about due to losing a match against a rival team when she was still a student due to a dislocated shoulder, which disqualified her. Since then, she has made her goal to make Suiran High win against anyone, even if through underhanded means. * Leo Morimoto as : The kindly principal of Saku High. He has faith in his school despite their impending closure, especially once Naoya enrolls, and gives his advice to the school's teachers and students not to waver in their faith for them. * Yukiya Kitamura as : The grumpy vice- principal of Saku High. Despite being a teacher of Saku High, he constantly criticizes Saku High students for their supposed bad habits and actually sides with Suiran High in several matters, such as when Naoya is framed up for vandalism. After the act is proven wrong, however, Kuwahara grows to attach himself with the team and even gives the greatest contribution for their apparatus late into the series. * You Yokoyama as : The legendary graduate of Saku High who became Naoya's idol when he saved him from bullies and encouraged him never to give up in his dreams. He gave his coat to Naoya and told him to return it once he became strong. However, when Naoya meets with Kurosawa again, the latter has backed out on his words and says that Saku High is \\"worthless\\". It turns out that his opinion changed because he was humiliated due to being Saku High's student. Kurosawa is convinced, though, to take back his words by Naoya, and, at the final episode, thanks Naoya by giving him his coat again. * Sarutoki Minagawa as : Nagisa's father. * Shoko Iketsu as : Nagisa's mother. * Takashi Ukaji as : A retired legendary water polo player who owns an inn near a beach. Principal Arakawa arranges for him to meet with Saku High's water polo team and teach them through secret means, such as forcing Naoya to cut up wood in order to build up his muscles. * Kanna Hashimoto as herself : A member of the idol group Rev. from DVL Tomoki, Kohei, and Shinsuke adore. She became the sponsor for the national championship, hence why the trio are so determined to win against Suiran High so Kanna can cheer for them. Unbeknownst to Naoya, Kanna meets with him while she is preparing for a concert and is told by Naoya about Saku High's water polo team, whom he places his faith with Kanna says about this meeting to her fans before her concert in front of the bewildered Tomoki, Kohei, and Shinsuke, who immediately race to join Naoya in the summer camp that they abandoned.

His grandmother also gave private piano and voice lessons. He received his first guitar lesson at age eight, learned trumpet in middle school, and picked up the bass to participate in rock bands in high school. After high school, he began studying the guitar intensely, leading to a gig in the rhythm and blues group Lovera. He took private lessons with guitarists such as Joe Pass, and Ted Greene. He then landed a touring gig with the Deniece Williams Band, which opened shows for many other notable acts of the Motown era, such as KC and the Sunshine Band and Earth, Wind & Fire. Under the name \\"Johnny Malibu\\", Heussenstamm recorded and performed with the Surf Punks. In the late 1970s, he continued to expand his musical horizons by briefly studying Indian music with Ali Akbar Khan.

It is a small tree with an oval, spreading form and dense foliage which sometimes reaches to the ground. It is widely cultivated in Australia and the United States because of its ornamental shape and decorative flowers, buds and fruit. There has been some confusion about its classification because of its ability to hybridise.flower budsflowerfruit Description Eucalyptus lehmannii is a sometimes multi-trunked mallee with smooth bark which is whitish grey to grey- brown and orange-brown and which sheds in strips. The stems of young plants are initially triangular in cross-section with leaves that are alternate, oblong to elliptical or lance-shaped, 5-8 cm long and 1-3 cm wide, glossy green on the upper surface and dull blue-green below. Older stems are smooth and round with alternate leaves. The adult leaves have a petiole 0.1-1.5 cm long and a blade elliptical to oval-shaped, about 4.5-9.5 cm long and 0.7-2.8 cm wide and both surfaces glossy light to mid-green. The oil glands in the leaves common to all eucalypts, are obscure or scattered. The inflorescences appear in the axils of the leaves, have a flattened stalk 4-11 cm which curves downwards as the flowers open. There may be 11-19 or more buds in each inflorescence, with their bases joined. By the time the bud opens, it is about 3.3-6.5 cm long, including the cap (strictly the operculum) and 0.5-1.0 cm wide at the base of the cap. The stamens are erect and greenish-yellow. Taxonomy and naming The species was originally in 1844 named by Schauer in Plantae Preissianae as Symphyomyrtus lehmannii. In 1867, George Bentham in Flora Australiensis placed it in the genus Eucalyptus as Eucalyptus lehmannii after Johann Georg Christian Lehmann who was Professor of Botany and Director of the Botanic Gardens in Hamburg and editor of Plantae Preissianae. There is some confusion between the species E. lehmannii and E. conferruminata - some authors place this tree in E. conferruminata. Others discriminate between these two species on characters such as operculum length - E. conferruminata is said to have a relatively short operculum. Eucalyptus lehmannii belongs in Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus, section Bisectae, subsection Hadrotes because of its coarsely bisected cotyledons, erect stamens and larger, thick- rimmed fruits. The subsection Hadrotes contains ten species of which eight do not have oil glands in the branchlet pith. Together these eight species form series Lehmannianae, a group that has fruit with exserted valves that have fused tips even after the seeds are lost, a feature also shared with the distantly related Eucalyptus cornuta. Of the eight species in series Lehmannianae, four species (Eucalyptus lehmannii, E. conferruminata, E. mcquoidii and E. arborella) have the buds in each axillary cluster, fused basally. Distribution and habitat Bushy yate is found in southern coastal and subcoastal areas from east of Albany towards Israelite Bay, including the Stirling Range. It occurs in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Warren biogeographic regions of Western Australia growing in sandy soils over granite or quartzite, often with gravel on rocky hills and coastal dunes. Ecology Eucalyptus lehmannii, as well as some others of the genus including Eucalyptus cladocalyx, Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus grandis have been described as invasive in southern Africa. Use Bushy yate is a useful ornamental in Australia as a small screen, an individual specimen or as a grove. It has also been grown in other countries, including Europe and South Africa. In the United States it is described as \\"a useful screen or attractive courtyard tree for areas as far north as San Francisco Bay\\".

Khedery, who spoke fluent Arabic, traveled with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and knew all the other Iraqi politicians. At Bremer's request, he had worked with Samir Sumaidaie when he was interior minister, before Bayan Jabr took over and allowed the Badr militia to set up secret prisons in the Jadriya compound.

She believed he had been taken to the Jadriya prison. Khedery moved heaven and earth to try to find him. In the summer of 2007, she called him at his desk outside Crocker's office. Her pitiful voice rent him. He was deeply pained that he had not been able to find her son. He hated to admit it, but he knew that the young man was very likely dead.
