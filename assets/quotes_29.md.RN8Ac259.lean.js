A field army (or numbered army or simply army) is a military formation in many armed forces, composed of two or more corps and may be subordinate to an army group. Likewise, air armies are equivalent formation within some air forces. A field army is composed of 100,000 to 300,000 troops. Specific field armies are usually named or numbered to distinguish them from \\"army\\" in the sense of an entire national land military force. In English, the typical orthographic style for writing out the names field armies is word numbers, such as \\"First Army\\"; whereas corps are usually distinguished by Roman numerals (e.g. I Corps) and subordinate formations with ordinal numbers (e.g. 1st Division). A field army may be given a geographical name in addition to or as an alternative to a numerical name, such as the British Army of the Rhine, Army of the Niemen or Aegean Army (also known as the Fourth Army). The Roman army was among the first to feature a formal field army, in the sense of a very large, combined arms formation, namely the sacer comitatus, which may be translated literally as \\"sacred escort\\". The term is derived from the fact that they were commanded by Roman emperors (who were regarded as sacred), when they acted as field commanders. While the Roman comitatensis (plural: comitatenses) is sometimes translated as \\"field army\\", it may also be translated as the more generic \\"field force\\" or \\"mobile force\\" (as opposed to limitanei or garrison units). In some armed forces, an \\"army\\" is or has been equivalent to a corps-level unit. Prior to 1945, this was the case with a gun (Ëªç; \\"army\\") within the Imperial Japanese Army, for which the formation equivalent in size to a field army was an \\"area army\\" (ÊñπÈù¢Ëªç; h≈çmen-gun). In the Soviet Red Army and the Soviet Air Forces, an army was subordinate in wartime to a front (an equivalent of army group). It contained at least three to five divisions along with artillery, air defense, reconnaissance and other supporting units. It could be classified as either a combined arms army (CAA) or tank army (TA); and while both were combined arms formations, the former contained a larger number of motorized rifle divisions while the later contained a larger number of tank divisions.US Army, FM 100-2-3 The Soviet Army: Troops, Organization and Equipment, Paragraph 1-3. In peacetime, a Soviet army was usually subordinate to a military district. Modern field armies are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility. For instance, within NATO a field army is composed of a headquarters, and usually controls at least two corps, beneath which are a variable number of divisions. A battle is influenced at the field army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point. NATO armies are commanded by a general or lieutenant general.

History The party was founded on 11 January 1989 in the Cankar Hall in Ljubljana, and Dimitrij Rupel was elected as its president. It was one of the first political party established in opposition to the Communist regime. It was founded mostly by intellectuals around the alternative journal Nova revija and it was initially called Slovenian Democratic Union of Reason. In December 1989, it joined the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia, together with the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia, the Slovene Christian Democrats, the Slovenian People's Party and the Greens of Slovenia. In April 1990, the coalition won the first free elections in Slovenia after World War II, gaining around 55% of the popular vote. The Slovenian Democratic Union received around 9,5% of the vote, becoming the third largest party in the coalition and the fifth in the Slovenian National Assembly. Despite the relatively modest result, members of the party covered several key positions in the new cabinet led by the Christian Democrat Lojze Peterle, such as the Ministry of Interior, Defence, Justice, Information. Besides, the party member France Buƒçar was elected president of the Slovenian parliament. After the independence of Slovenia, the party split into two. Its left liberal wing, led by the president Dimitrij Rupel, founded the Democratic Party, while the conservative wing, led by the minister of justice Rajko Pirnat established the centre-right National Democratic Party. In the election of 1992, both parties suffered a defeat. The Democratic Party gained 5,01% of the popular vote, and in 1994, most of its members joined the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia. The National Democratic Party obtained 2,18% of the vote and no seats in Parliament. In 1993, the National Democrats joined the Slovene Christian Democrats, and in 1995 they switched to the Slovenian Social Democratic Party. Despite its relatively small popular support, the Slovenian Democratic Union was one of the most influential parties in Slovenia between 1988 and 1991.

Hagen stands to the right of Siegfried with a bow. From the Hundeshagenscher Kodex. Gram\\" (1901) by Johannes Gehrts. Siegfried's Departure from Kriemhild, by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, c. 1843 Sigurd (Old Norse: ) or Siegfried (Middle High German: S√Ævrit) is a legendary hero of Germanic mythology, who killed a dragon and was later murdered. It is possible he was inspired by one or more figures from the Frankish Merovingian dynasty, with Sigebert I being the most popular contender. Older scholarship sometimes connected him with Arminius, victor of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. He may also have a purely mythological origin. Sigurd's story is first attested on a series of carvings, including runestones from Sweden and stone crosses from the British Isles, dating from the eleventh century. In both the Norse and continental Germanic tradition, Sigurd is portrayed as dying as the result of a quarrel between his wife (Gudrun/Kriemhild) and another woman, Brunhild, whom he has tricked into marrying the Burgundian king Gunnar/Gunther. His slaying of a dragon and possession of the hoard of the Nibelungen is also common to both traditions. In other respects, however, the two traditions appear to diverge. The most important works to feature Sigurd are the Nibelungenlied, the V√∂lsunga saga, and the Poetic Edda. He also appears in numerous other works from both Germany and Scandinavia, including a series of medieval and early modern Scandinavian ballads. Richard Wagner used the legends about Sigurd/Siegfried in his operas and . Wagner relied heavily on the Norse tradition in creating his version of Siegfried. His depiction of the hero has influenced many subsequent depictions. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Siegfried became heavily associated with German nationalism. The Thidrekssaga finishes its tale of Sigurd by saying  Etymology  The names Sigurd and Siegfried do not share the same etymology. Both have the same first element, Proto-Germanic *sigi-, meaning victory. The second elements of the two names are different, however: in Siegfried, it is Proto-Germanic *-fri√∞, meaning peace; in Sigurd, it is Proto-Germanic *-ward, meaning protection. Although they do not share the same second element, it is clear that surviving Scandinavian written sources held Siegfried to be the continental version of the name they called Sigurd. The normal form of Siegfried in Middle High German is S√Ævrit or S√Æfrit, with the *sigi- element contracted. This form of the name had been common even outside of heroic poetry since the ninth century, though the form Sigevrit is also attested, along with the Middle Dutch Zegevrijt. In Early Modern German, the name develops to Seyfrid or Seufrid (spelled Sewfrid). The modern form Siegfried is not attested frequently until the seventeenth century, after which it becomes more common. In modern scholarship, the form Sigfrid is sometimes used. The Old Norse name Sigur√∞r is contracted from an original *Sigv«´r√∞r, which in turn derives from an older *Sigi-war√∞uR. The Danish form Sivard also derives from this form originally. Hermann Reichert notes that the form of the root -v«´r√∞r instead of -var√∞r is only found in the name Sigurd, with other personal names instead using the form -var√∞r; he suggests that the form -v«´r√∞r may have had religious significance, whereas -var√∞r was purely non-religious in meaning. There are competing theories as to which name is original. Names equivalent to Siegfried are first attested in Anglo-Saxon Kent in the seventh century and become frequent in Anglo-Saxon England in the ninth century. Jan-Dirk M√ºller argues that this late date of attestation means that it is possible that Sigurd more accurately represents the original name. Wolfgang Haubrichs suggests that the form Siegfried arose in the bilingual Frankish kingdom as a result of romance-language influence on an original name *Sigi-ward. According to the normal phonetic principles, the Germanic name would have become Romance-language *Sigevert, a form which could also represent a Romance-language form of Germanic Sigefred. He further notes that *Sigevert would be a plausible Romance-language form of the name Sigebert (see Origins) from which both names could have arisen. As a second possibility, Haubrichs considers the option that metathesis of the r in *Sigi- ward could have taken place in Anglo-Saxon England, where variation between -frith and -ferth is well documented. Hermann Reichert, on the other hand, notes that Scandinavian figures who are attested in pre-twelfth-century German, English, and Irish sources as having names equivalent to Siegfried are systematically changed to forms equivalent to Sigurd in later Scandinavian sources. Forms equivalent to Sigurd, on the other hand, do not appear in pre- eleventh-century non-Scandinavian sources, and older Scandinavian sources sometimes call persons Sigfro√∞r Sigfre√∞r or Sigfr«´√∞r who are later called Sigur√∞r. He argues from this evidence that a form equivalent to Siegfried is the older form of Sigurd's name in Scandinavia as well.  Origins  Unlike many figures of Germanic heroic tradition, Sigurd cannot be easily identified with a historical figure. The most popular theory is that Sigurd has his origins in one or several figures of the Merovingian dynasty of the Franks: the Merovingians had several kings whose name began with the element *sigi-. In particular, the murder of Sigebert I, who was married to Brunhilda of Austrasia, is often cited as a likely inspiration for the figure, a theory that was first proposed in 1613. Sigibert was murdered by his brother Chilperic I at the instigation of Chilperic's wife queen Fredegunda. If this theory is correct, then in the legend, Fredegunda and Brunhilda appear to have switched roles, while Chilperic has been replaced with Gunther. These parallels are, however, not exact and not accepted by all scholars. Jens Haustein argues that, while the story of Sigurd appears to have Merovingian resonances, no connection to any concrete historical figure or event is convincing. Another theory argues that Sigurd and his slaying of the dragon represented a mythological version of Arminius's defeat of Publius Quinctilius Varus at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. A connection between Siegfried and Arminius was first proposed by Franz-Joseph Mone in 1830, who believed Sigurd to be an amalgamation of several historical figures. In 1837, Adolf Griesebrecht proposed that Sigurd is a mythologized version of Arminius, while the Romans represent the dragon. The most recent scholar to take this position is Otto H√∂fler, beginning in 1959, who also suggested that Gnita- Heath, the name of the place where Sigurd kills the dragon in the Scandinavian tradition, represents the battlefield for the Teutoburg Forest, while Arminius's Germanic name may have been *Segi-fri√æuz. Modern scholarship generally dismisses a connection between Sigurd and Arminius as tenuous speculation. The idea that Sigurd derives from Arminius nevertheless continues to be promoted outside of the academic sphere, including in popular magazines such as Der Spiegel. It has also been suggested that Sigurd may be a purely mythological figure without a historical origin. Nineteenth-century scholars frequently derived the Sigurd story from myths about Germanic deities including Odin, Baldr, and Freyr; such derivations are no longer generally accepted. Catalin Taranu argues that Sigurd's slaying of the dragon ultimately has Indo-European origins, and that this story later became attached to the story of the murder of the Merovingian Sigebert I.  Continental Germanic traditions and attestations  Relief \\"Siegfried in Xanten\\" on the Nordwall in Xanten. Continental Germanic traditions about Siegfried enter writing with the Nibelungelied around 1200. The German tradition strongly associates Siegfried with a kingdom called \\"Niederland\\" (Middle High German Niderlant), which, despite its name, is not the same as the modern Netherlands, but describes Siegfried's kingdom around the city of Xanten. The late medieval Heldenbuch- Prosa identifies \\"Niederland\\" with the area around Worms but describes it as a separate kingdom from king Gibich's land (i.e. the Burgundian kingdom). = Nibelungenlied = The death of Siegfried. Nibelungenlied manuscript-k. \\"Siegfriedsbrunnen\\" in Odenheim: one of several purported localizations of the place of Siegfried's murder in the Odenwald. The Nibelungenlied gives two contradictory descriptions of Siegfried's youth. On the level of the main story, Siegfried is given a courtly upbringing in Xanten by his father king Siegmund and mother Sieglind. When he is seen coming to Worms, capital of the Burgundian kingdom to woo the princess Kriemhild, however, the Burgundian vassal Hagen von Tronje narrates a different story of Siegfried's youth: according to Hagen, Siegfried was a wandering warrior (Middle High German recke) who won the hoard of the Nibelungen as well as the sword Balmung and a cloak of invisibility (Tarnkappe) that increases the wearer's strength twelve times. He also tells an unrelated tale about how Siegfried killed a dragon, bathed in its blood, and thereby received skin as hard as horn that makes him invulnerable. Of the features of young Siegfried's adventures, only those that are directly relevant to the rest of the story are mentioned. In order to win the hand of Kriemhild, Siegfried becomes a friend of the Burgundian kings Gunther, Gernot, and Giselher. When Gunther decides to woo the warlike queen of Iceland, Br√ºnhild, he offers to let Siegfried marry Kriemhild in exchange for Siegfried's help in his wooing of Br√ºnhild. As part of Siegfried's help, they lie to Br√ºnhild and claim that Siegfried is Gunther's vassal. Any wooer of Br√ºnhild's must accomplish various physical tasks, and she will kill any man who fails. Siegfried, using his cloak of invisibility, aids Gunther in each task. Upon their return to Worms, Siegfried marries Kriemhild following Gunther's marriage to Br√ºnhild. On Gunther's wedding night, however, Br√ºnhild prevents him from sleeping with her, tying him up with her belt and hanging him from a hook. The next night, Siegfried uses his cloak of invisibility to overpower Br√ºnhild, allowing Gunther to sleep with her. Although he does not sleep with Br√ºnhild, Siegfried takes her belt and ring, later giving them to Kriemhild. Siegfried and Kriemhild have a son, whom they name Gunther. Later, Br√ºnhild and Kriemhild begin to fight over which of them should have precedence, with Br√ºnhild believing that Kriemhild is only the wife of a vassal. Finally, in front of the door of the cathedral in Worms, the two queens argue who should enter first. Br√ºnhild openly accuses Kriemhild of being married to a vassal, and Kriemhild claims that Siegfried took Br√ºnhild's virginity, producing the belt and ring as proof. Although Siegfried denies this publicly, Hagen and Br√ºnhild decide to murder Siegfried, and Gunther acquiesces. Hagen tricks Kriemhild into telling him where Siegfried's skin is vulnerable, and Gunther invites Siegfried to take part in a hunt in the Waskenwald (the Vosges). When Siegfried is slaking his thirst at a spring, Hagen stabs him on the vulnerable part of his back with a spear. Siegfried is mortally wounded but still attacks Hagen, before cursing the Burgundians and dying. Hagen arranges to have Siegfried's corpse thrown outside the door to Kriemhild's bedroom. Kriemhild mourns Siegfried greatly and he is buried in Worms. The redaction of the text known as the Nibelungenlied C makes several small changes to localizations in the text: Siegfried is not killed in the Vosges, but in the Odenwald, with the narrator claiming that one can still visit the spring where he was killed near the village of Odenheim (today part of √ñstringen). The redactor states the Siegfried was buried at the abbey of Lorsch rather than Worms. It is also mentioned that he was buried in a marble sarcophagus‚Äîthis may be connected to actual marble sarcophagi that were displayed in the abbey, having been dug up following a fire in 1090. = Rosengarten zu Worms = Dietrich and Siegfried from a 15th-century manuscript of the Rosengarten zu Worms In the Rosengarten zu Worms (c. 1250), Siegfried is betrothed to Kriemhild and is one of the twelve heroes who defends her rose garden in Worms. Kriemhild decides that she would like to test Siegfried's mettle against the hero Dietrich von Bern, and so she invites him and twelve of his warriors to fight her twelve champions. When the fight is finally meant to begin, Dietrich initially refuses to fight Siegfried on the grounds that the dragon's blood has made Siegfried's skin invulnerable. Dietrich is convinced to fight Siegfried by the false news that his mentor Hildebrand is dead and becomes so enraged that he begins to breathe fire, melting Siegfried's protective layer of horn on his skin. He is thus able to penetrate Siegfried's skin with his sword, and Siegfried becomes so afraid that he flees to Kriemhild's lap. Only the reappearance of Hildebrand prevents Dietrich from killing Siegfried. Siegfried's role as Kriemhild's fianc√© does not accord with the Nibelungenlied, where the two are never formally betrothed. The detail that Kriemhild's father is named Gibich rather than Dancrat, the latter being his name in the Nibelungenlied, shows that the Rosengarten does include some old traditions absent in that poem, although it is still highly dependent on the Nibelungenlied. Some of the details agree with the Thidrekssaga. Rosengarten A mentions that Siegfried was raised by a smith named Eckerich. = √ûi√∞rekssaga = Although the √ûi√∞rekssaga (c. 1250) is written in Old Norse, the majority of the material is translated from German (particularly Low German) oral tales, as well as possibly some from German written sources such as the Nibelungenlied. Therefore, it is included here. The Thidrekssaga refers to Siegfried both as Sigurd (Sigur√∞r) and an Old Norse approximation of the name Siegfried, Sigfr≈ì√∞. He is the son of king Sigmund of Tarlungaland (probably a corruption of Karlungaland, i.e. the land of the Carolingians) and queen Sisibe of Spain. When Sigmund returns from a campaign one day, he discovers his wife is pregnant, and believing her to be unfaithful to him, he exiles her to the \\"Swabian Forest\\" (the Black Forest?), where she gives birth to Sigurd. She dies after some time, and Sigurd is suckled by a hind before being found by the smith Mimir. Mimir tries to raise the boy, but Sigurd is so unruly that Mimir sends him to his brother Regin, who has transformed into a dragon, in the hopes that he will kill the boy. Sigurd, however, slays the dragon and tastes its flesh, whereby he learns the language of the birds and of Mimir's treachery. He smears himself with dragon's blood, making his skin invulnerable, and returns to Mimir. Mimir gives him weapons to placate him, but Sigurd kills him anyway. He then encounters Brynhild (Br√ºnhild), who gives him the horse Grane, and goes to King Isung of Bertangenland. One day Thidrek (Dietrich von Bern) comes to Bertangenland; he fights against Sigurd for three days. Thidrek is unable to wound Sigurd because of his invulnerable skin, but on the third day, Thidrek receives the sword Mimung, which can cut through Sigurd's skin, and defeats him. Thidrek and Sigurd then ride to King Gunnar (Gunther), where Sigurd marries Gunnar's sister Grimhild (Kriemhild). Sigurd recommends to Gunnar that he marry Brynhild, and the two ride to woo for her. Brynhild now claims that Sigurd had earlier said he would marry her (unmentioned before in the text), but eventually she agrees to marry Gunnar. She will not, however, allow Gunnar to consummate the marriage, and so with Gunnar's agreement, Sigurd takes Gunnar's shape and deflowers Brynhild, taking away her strength. The heroes then return with Brynhild to Gunnar's court. Sometime later, Grimhild and Brynhild fight over who has a higher rank. Brynhild claims that Sigurd is not of noble birth, after which Grimhild announces that Sigurd and not Gunnar deflowered Brynhild. Brynhild convinces Gunnar and H√∂gni (Hagen) to murder Sigurd, which H√∂gni does while Sigurd is drinking from a spring on a hunt. The brothers then place his corpse in Grimhild's bed, and she mourns. The author of the saga has made a number of changes to create a more or less coherent story out of the many oral and possibly written sources that he used to create the saga. The author mentions alternative Scandinavian versions of many of these same tales, and appears to have changed some details to match the stories known by his Scandinavian audience. This is true in particular for the story of Sigurd's youth, which combines elements from the Norse and continental traditions attested later in Das Lied vom H√ºrnen Seyfrid, but also contains an otherwise unattested story of Siegfried's parents. The Thidrekssaga makes no mention of how Sigurd won the hoard of the Nibelungen. = Biterolf und Dietleib = The second half of the heroic poem Biterolf und Dietleib (between 1250 and 1300) features a war between the Burgundian heroes of the Nibelungenlied and the heroes of the cycle around Dietrich von Bern, something likely inspired by the Rosengarten zu Worms. In this context, it also features a fight between Siegfried and Dietrich in which Dietrich defeats Siegfried after initially appearing cowardly. The text also features a fight between Siegfried and the hero Heime, in which Siegfried knocks Heime's famous sword Nagelring out of his hand, after which both armies fight for control over the sword. The text also relates that Dietrich once brought Siegfried to Etzel's court as a hostage, something which is also alluded to in the Nibelungenlied. = Heldenbuch-Prosa = The so-called \\"Heldenbuch-Prosa\\", first found in the 1480 Heldenbuch of Diebolt von Hanowe and afterwards contained in printings until 1590, is considered one of the most important attestations of a continued oral tradition outside of the Nibelungenlied, with many details agreeing with the Thidrekssaga. The Heldenbuch-Prosa has very little to say about Siegfried: it notes that he was the son of King Siegmund, came from \\"Niederland\\", and was married to Kriemhild. Unattested in any other source, however, is that Kriemhild orchestrated the disaster at Etzel's court in order to avenge Siegfried being killed by Dietrich von Bern. According to the Heldenbuch- Prosa, Dietrich killed Siegfried fighting in the rose garden at Worms (see the Rosengarten zu Worms section above). This may have been another version of Siegfried's death that was in oral circulation. = Das Lied vom H√ºrnen Seyfrid = Siegfried fights the dragon to rescue Kriemhild. Early modern woodcut of H√ºrnen Seyfrid. Das Lied vom H√ºrnen Seyfrid (the song of horn- skinned Siegfried) is a late medieval/early modern heroic ballad that gives an account of Siegfried's adventures in his youth. It agrees in many details with the Thidrekssaga and other Old Norse accounts over the Nibelungenlied, suggesting that these details existed in an oral tradition about Siegfried in Germany. According to the H√ºrnen Seyfrid, Siegfried had to leave his father Siegmund's court for his uncouth behavior and was raised by a smith in the forest. He was so unruly, however, that the smith arranged for him to be killed by a dragon. Siegfried was able to kill the dragon, however, and eventually kills many more by trapping them under logs and setting them on fire. The dragon's skin, described as hard as horn, melts, and Siegfried sticks his finger into it, discovering that his finger is now hard as horn as well. He smears himself with the melted dragon skin everywhere except for one spot. Later, he stumbles upon the trail of another dragon that has kidnapped princess Kriemhild of Worms. With the help of the dwarf Eugel, Siegfried fights the giant Kuperan, who has the key to the mountain Kriemhild has been taken to. He rescues the princess and slays the dragon, finding the treasure of the Nibelungen inside the mountain. Eugel prophesies, however, the Siegfried only has eight years to live. Realizing he will not be able to use the treasure, Siegfried dumps the treasure into the Rhine on his way to Worms. He marries Kriemhild and rules there together with her brothers Gunther, Hagen, and Giselher, but they resent him and have him killed after eight years. = Other traditions and attestations = Fresco of the heroes Dietrich von Bern, Siegfried, and Dietleib. Runkelstein Castle, near Bozen, South Tyrol, c. 1400. The Icelandic Abbot Nicholaus of Thvera records that while travelling through Westphalia, he was shown the place where Sigurd slew the dragon (called Gnita-Heath in the Norse tradition) between two villages south of Paderborn. In a song of the mid-thirteenth-century wandering lyric poet Der Marner, \\"the death of Siegfried\\" (Sigfrides [...] t√¥t) is mentioned as a popular story that the German courtly public enjoys hearing, along with \\"the hoard of the Nibelungs\\" (der Nibelunge hort). The chronicles of the city of Worms record that when Emperor Frederick III visited the city in 1488, he learned that the townspeople said that the \\"giant Siegfried\\" (gigas [...] Sifridus des H√∂rnen) was buried in the cemetery of St. Meinhard and St. Cecilia. Frederick ordered the graveyard dug up‚Äîaccording to one Latin source, he found nothing, but a German chronicle reports that he found a skull and some bones that were larger than normal.  Scandinavian traditions and attestations  In contrast to the surviving continental traditions, Scandinavian stories about Sigurd have a strong connection to Germanic mythology. While older scholarship took this to represent the original form of the Sigurd story, newer scholarship is more inclined to see it as a development of the tradition that is unique to Scandinavia. While some elements of the Scandinavian tradition may indeed be older than the surviving continental witnesses, a good deal seems to have been transformed by the context of the Christianization of Iceland and Scandinavia: the frequent appearance of the heathen gods gives the heroic stories the character of an epoch that is irrevocably over. Although the earliest attestations for the Scandinavian tradition are pictorial depictions, because these images can only be understood with a knowledge of the stories they depict, they are listed last here. = The Prose Edda = Sigurd as imagined by Jenny Nystr√∂m (1854‚Äì1946). The so-called Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson is the earliest non- pictorial attestation of the Scandinavian version of Sigurd's life, dating to around 1220. Snorri retells the story of Sigurd in several chapters of the section of the poem called Sk√°ldskaparsm√°l. His presentation of the story is very similar to that found in the V√∂lsunga saga (see below), but is considerably shorter. This version does not mention Sigurd's vengeance for the death of his father. The text identifies Sigurd as being raised in a place called \\"Thjod.\\" Sigurd is raised at the court of king Hj√°lprek, receives the sword Gram from the smith Regin, and slays the dragon Fafnir on Gnita-Heath by lying in a pit and stabbing it in the heart from underneath. Sigurd tastes the dragon's blood and understands the birds when they say that Regin will kill him in order to acquire the dragon's gold. He then kills Regin and takes the hoard of the Nibelungen for himself. He rides away with the hoard and then awakens the valkyrie Brynhild by cutting the armor from her, before coming to king Gjuki's kingdom. There he marries Gjuki's daughter, Gudrun, and helps her brother, Gunnar, to acquire Brynhild's hand from her brother Atli. Sigurd deceives Brynhild by taking Gunnar's shape when Gunnar cannot fulfill the condition that he ride through a wall of flames to wed her; Sigurd rides through the flames and weds Brynhild, but does not sleep with her, placing his sword between them in the marriage bed. Sigurd and Gunnar then return to their own shapes. Sigurd and Gudrun have two children, Svanhild and young Sigmund. Later, Brynhild and Gudrun quarrel and Gudrun reveals that Sigurd was the one who rode through the fire, and shows a ring that Sigurd took from Brynhild as proof. Brynhild then arranges to have Sigurd killed by Gunnar's brother Guthorm. Guthorm stabs Sigurd in his sleep, but Sigurd is able to slice Guthorm in half by throwing his sword before dying. Guthorm has also killed Sigurd's three-year-old son Sigmund. Brynhild then kills herself and is burned on the same pyre as Sigurd. = The Poetic Edda = The Poetic Edda appears to have been compiled around 1270 in Iceland, and assembles mythological and heroic songs of various ages. The story of Sigurd forms the core of the heroic poems collected here. However, the details of Sigurd's life and death in the various poems contradict each other, so that \\"the story of Sigurd does not emerge clearly from the Eddic verse.\\" Generally, none of the poems is thought to be have been composed before 900 and some appear to have been written in the thirteenth century. It is also possible that apparently old poems have been written in an archaicizing style and that apparently recent poems are reworkings of older material, so that reliable dating is impossible. The Poetic Edda identifies Sigurd as a king of the Franks.  Fr√° dau√∞a Sinfj√∂tla  Fr√° dau√∞a Sinfj√∂tla is a short prose text between the songs. Sigurd is born at the end of the poem; he is the posthumous son of Sigmund, who dies fighting the sons of Hunding, and Hjordis. Hjordis is married to the son of Hj√°lprek and allowed to raise Sigurd in Hj√°lprek's home.  Gr√≠pissp√°  In Gr√≠pissp√°, Sigurd goes to Gr√≠pir, his uncle on his mother's side, in order to hear a prophecy about his life. Gr√≠pir tells Sigurd that he will kill Hunding's sons, the dragon Fafnir, and the smith Regin, acquiring the hoard of the Nibelungen. Then he will wake a valkyrie and learn runes from her. Gr√≠pir does not want to tell Sigurd any more, but Sigurd forces him to continue. He says that Sigurd will go to the home of Heimer and betroth himself to Brynhild, but then at the court of King Gjuki he will receive a potion that will make him forget his promise and marry Gudrun. He will then acquire Brynhild as a wife for Gunnar and sleep with Brynhild without having sex with her. Brynhild will recognize the deception, however, and claim that Sigurd did sleep with her, and this will cause Gunnar to have him killed. The poem is likely fairly young and seems to have been written to connect the previous poems about Helgi Hundingsbane with those about Sigurd.  Poems of Sigurd's Youth  The following three poems form a single unit in the manuscript of the Poetic Edda, but are split into three by modern scholars. They likely contain old material, but the poems themselves appear to be relatively recent versions. The poems also mix two conceptions of Sigurd: on the one hand, he is presented as an intelligent royal prince, on the other, he is raised by the smith Regin and is presented as stupid. It is most likely that Sigurd's youth with the smith, his stupidity, and his success through supernatural aid rather than his own cunning is the more original of these conceptions. = Reginsm√°l = In Reginsm√°l, the smith Regin, who is staying at the court of Hj√°lprek, tells Sigurd of a hoard that the gods had had to assemble in order to compensate the family of √ìtr, whom they had killed. Fafnir, √ìtr's brother, guards the treasure now and has turned into a dragon. Regin wants Sigurd to kill the dragon. He makes the sword Gram for Sigurd, but Sigurd chooses to kill Lyngvi and the other sons of Hunding before he kills the dragon. On his way he is accompanied by Odin. After killing the brothers in battle and carving a blood eagle on Lyngvi, Regin praises Sigurd's ferocity in battle. = F√°fnism√°l = In F√°fnism√°l, Sigurd accompanies Regin to Gnita-Heath, where he digs a pit. He stabs Fafnir through the heart from underneath when the dragon passes over the pit. Fafnir, before he dies, tells Sigurd some wisdom and warns him of the curse that lays on the hoard. Once the dragon is dead, Regin tears out the Fafnir's heart and tells Sigurd to cook it. Sigurd checks whether the heart is done with his finger and burns it. When he puts his finger into his mouth, he can understand the language of the birds, who warn him of Regin's plan to kill him. He kills the smith and is told by the birds to go to a palace surrounded by flames where the valkyrie Sigdrifa is asleep. Sigurd heads there, loading the hoard on his horse. = Sigrdr√≠fum√°l = In Sigrdr√≠fum√°l, Sigurd rides to Hindarfjal, where he finds a wall made of shields. Inside he finds a sleeping woman who is wearing armor that seems to have grown into her skin. Sigurd cuts open the armor and Sigdrifa, the valkyrie, wakes up. She teaches him the runes, some magic spells, and gives him advice.  Brot af Sigur√∞arkvi√∞u  Sigurd's horse Grani mourns over his body Only the ending of Brot af Sigur√∞arkvi√∞u is preserved. The poem begins with H√∂gni and Gunnar discussing whether Sigurd needs to be murdered. H√∂gni suggests that Brynhild may be lying that Sigurd slept with Brynhild. Then Guthorm, Gunnar and H√∂gni's younger brother, murders Sigurd in the forest, after which Brynhild admits that Sigurd never slept with her. The poem shows the influence of continental Germanic traditions, as it portrays Sigurd's death in the forest rather than in his bed.  Fr√° dau√∞a Sigur√∞ar  Fr√° dau√∞a Sigur√∞ar is a short prose text between the songs. The text mentions that, although the previous song said that Sigurd was killed in the forest, other songs say he was murdered in bed. German songs say that he was killed in the forest, but the next song in the codex, Gu√∞r√∫narqvi√∞a in fursta, says that he was killed while going to a thing.  Sigur√∞arkvi√∞a hin skamma  In Sigur√∞arkvi√∞a hin skamma, Sigurd comes to the court of Gjuki and he, Gunnar, and H√∂gni swear friendship to each other. Sigurd marries Gudrun, then acquires Brynhild for Gunnar and does not sleep with her. Brynhild desires Sigurd, however, and when she cannot have him decides to have him killed. Guthorm then slays Sigurd in his bed, but Sigurd kills him before dying. Brynhild then kills herself and asks to be burned on the same pyre as Sigurd. The poem is generally assumed not to be very old. = V√∂lsunga saga = Sigurd sucks his thumb after killing Fafnir ‚Äì Hylestad stave church. The V√∂lsunga saga is the most detailed account of Sigurd's life in either the German or Scandinavian traditions besides the Poetic Edda. It follows the plot given in the Poetic Edda fairly closely, although there is no indication that the author knew the other text. The author appears to have been working in Norway and to have known the Thidrekssaga, and therefore the V√∂lsunga Saga is dated to sometime in the second half of the thirteenth century. The saga changes the geographic location of Sigurd's life from Germany to Scandinavia. The saga is connected to a second saga, Ragnars saga Lo√∞br√≥kar, which follows it in the manuscript, by having Ragnar Lodbrok marry Aslaug, daughter of Sigurd and Brynhild. According to the V√∂lsunga saga, Sigurd is the posthumous son of King Sigmund and Hjordis. He died fighting Lyngvi, a rival for Hjordis's hand. Hjordis was left alone on the battlefield where Sigmund died, and was found there by King Alf, who married her and took the Sigmund's shattered sword. She gave birth to Sigurd soon afterwards, and was raised by the smith Regin at the court of King Hjalprek. One day Regin tells Sigurd the story of a hoard guarded by the dragon Fafnir, which had been paid by Odin, Loki, and Hoenir for the death of √ìtr. Sigurd asks Regin to make him a sword to kill the dragon, but each sword that Regin makes breaks when Sigurd proofs them against the anvil. Finally, Sigurd has Regin make a new sword out of Sigmund's shattered sword, and with this sword he is able to cut through the smith's anvil. Regin asks Sigurd to retrieve Regin's part of Fafnir's treasure, but Sigurd decides to avenge his father first. With an army he attacks and kills Lyngvi, receiving the help of Odin. Then Sigurd heads to Gnita-Heath to kill the dragon, hiding in a pit that Fafnir will travel over. Sigurd stabs Fafnir through the heart from underneath, killing him. Regin then appears, drinks some of the dragon's blood, and tells Sigurd to cook its heart. Sigurd tests with his finger whether the heart is done and burns himself; he sticks his finger in his mouth and can understand the language of the birds. The birds tell him that Regin plans to kill Sigurd and that he would be wiser to kill Regin first and then take the hoard and go to Brynhild. Sigurd does all of this, coming to where Brynhild lies asleep in a ring of shields and wearing armor that seems to have grown to her skin. Sigurd cuts the armor off her, waking Brynhild. Brynhild and Sigurd promise to marry each other, repeating their promise also at the court of Brynhild's brother-in-law Heimir. Sigurd and Gunnar at the Fire by J. C. Dollman (1909). Sigurd than comes to the court of King Gjuki; queen Grimhild gives him a potion so that he forgets his promise to Brynhild and agrees to marry her daughter Gudrun. Sigurd and Gjuki's sons Gunnar and H√∂gni swear an oath of loyalty to each other and become blood brothers. Meanwhile, Grimhild convinces Gunnar to marry Brynhild, which Brynhild's family agrees to. However, Brynhild will only marry Gunnar if he can cross the wall of fire that surrounds her castle. Gunnar is unable to do this, and Sigurd and Gunnar use a spell taught to them by Grimhild to change shapes. Sigurd then crosses the wall of flames, and Brynhild is astonished that anyone but Sigurd was able to perform this task. Sigurd then lies with Brynhild for three nights with a sword placed between them. Brynhild and Gunnar and Sigurd and Gudrun then marry on the same day. One day, Gudrun and Brynhild fight while bathing in the river over which of them has married the noblest man, and Gudrun tells Brynhild how she was tricked and shows her a ring that Sigurd had taken from her on her first night of marriage as proof. Brynhild is furious and wants revenge. When Sigurd goes to talk to her, the two confess their love for each other and Sigurd proposes divorcing Gudrun to be with Brynhild. Brynhild refuses, and later demands that Gunnar kill Sigurd. Gunnar tells his younger brother Guthorm to kill Sigurd, because he has never sworn loyalty to Sigurd. Guthorm, having eaten wolf's flesh, forces his way into Sigurd's bedchamber and stabs him in the back with his sword. Sigurd manages to kill Guthorm, assures Gudrun that he has always been loyal to Gunnar, and dies. Brynhild commits suicide soon afterwards, and she and Sigurd are both burned on the same pyre. = Ballads = The Scandinavian Sigurd tradition lived on in a number of ballads, attested from across the Nordic area. They often have very little in common with the original traditions, only using names found there.  In Denmark and Sweden  Several Danish ballads (Danish folkevise) feature Sigurd (known as Sivard); some also exist in Swedish variants. These ballads appear to have had both Scandinavian and German sources. In the ballad Sivard Snarensvend (DgF 2, SMB 204, TSB E 49), Sigurd kills his stepfather and rides, with great difficulty, the unbroken horse Gram to his uncle in Bern. In one variant, the ballad ends when Sigurd falls from the horse and dies after jumping over the city walls. In the ballad Sivard og Brynild (DgF 3, TSB E 101), Sigurd wins Brynhild on the \\"glass mountain\\" and then gives her to his friend Hagen. Brynhild then fights with Sigurd's wife Signild, and Signild shows Brynhild a ring that Brynhild had given Sigurd as a love gift. Brynhild then tells Hagen to kill Sigurd, and Hagen does this by first borrowing Sigurd's sword then killing him with it. He then shows Brynhild Sigurd's head and kills her too when she offers him her love. In the ballad Kong Diderik og hans K√¶mper (DgF 7, SMB 198, TSB E 10), Sigurd fights against Diderik's warrior Humlung. Sigurd defeats Humlung, but discovering that Humlung is his relative allows himself to be tied to an oak tree so that Humlung can claim to have defeated him. When Vidrek (Witege) doesn't believe Humlung and goes to check, Sigurd rips the oak tree from the ground and walks home with it on his back. In the ballad Kong Diderik og L√∏ven (DgF 9, TSB E 158), Sigurd (here as Syfred) is said to have been killed by a dragon; Svend Grundtvig suggests that this character corresponds to Ortnit, rather than Sigurd.  In Norway  The Norwegian ballad of \\"Sigurd Svein\\" (NMB 177, TSB E 50) tells of Sigurd's selection of the horse Grani and his ride to Greip (Gr√≠pir). Although the ballad has many archaic features, it is first recorded in the middle of the nineteenth century.  On the Faroe Islands  Sigurd (Sj√∫r√∞ur) jumps over the wall of flame on Grani. Faroese postage stamp from 1998. On the Faroe Islands, ballads about Sigurd are known as Sj√∫r√∞ar kv√¶√∞i (CCF 1; Sj√∫r√∞ur is the Faroese form of Sigurd); these ballads contain material from the Thidrekssaga and the V√∂lsunga saga. The original form of the ballads likely dates to the fourteenth century, though it is clear that many variants have been influenced by the Danish ballads. The Faroese ballads include Regin smi√∞ur (Regin the Smith, TSB E 51), Brynhildar t√°ttur (the song of Brynhild, TSB E 100), and H√∏gna t√°ttur (the song of H√∂gni, TSB E 55 and E 38). It is possible that Regin smi√∞ur is based on a lost Eddic poem. The Faroese ballads include Sigurd's slaying of the dragon and acquiring of the hoard, his wooing of Gudrun and Brynhild, and his death. They were not recorded until the end of the eighteenth century. = Pictorial Depictions = There are a number of proposed or confirmed depictions of Sigurd's youthful adventures in Scandinavia and on the British Isles in areas under Norse influence or control. Many of the oldest depictions are very unclear however, and their depiction of the Sigurd legend is often disputed. Attempts to identify depictions of the Sigurd story in Sang√ºesa (the \\"Spanish Sigurd\\"), in Naples (the \\"Norman Sigurd\\"), and in northern Germany have all been refuted. There are also no confirmed depictions from Denmark. Sigurd's killing of Fafnir can be iconographically identified by his killing of the dragon from below, in contrast to other depictions of warriors fighting dragons and other monsters. Surviving depictions of Sigurd are frequently found in churches or on crosses; this is likely because Sigurd's defeat of the dragon was seen as prefiguring Christ's defeat of Satan. It is also possible that he was identified with the Archangel Michael, who also defeated a dragon and played an important role in the Christianization of Scandinavia.  In Sweden  Sigurd with his sword, Andvari with the ring and Sigrdr√≠fa with a drinking horn on the Dr√§vle runestone from Uppland The Swedish material consists mostly of runestones which can be tentatively dated to the eleventh century. The earliest of these are from S√∂dermanland, the Ramsund carving and the G√∂k runestone, which appears to be a copy of the former. The stones depict Sigurd killing Fafnir, Regin's headless body surrounded by his smithing tools, Sigurd cooking Fafnir's heart, and the birds advising Sigurd above Grani. Two more depictions come from Uppland, the Dr√§vle runestone and a copy of it, the Storja Ramsj√∂ runestone. Both show Sigurd killing Fafnir. Three further depictions come from G√§strikland, the √Örsund runestone, the Ockelbo runestone, which has been lost, and the √ñster-F√§rnebo runestone. Sigurd is depicted stabbing Fafnir so that his sword takes the appearance of a u-rune. Other scenes on the runestones cannot be identified with the Sigurd legend securely, and the text on the stones is unrelated.  In the British Isles  The Kirk Andreas cross from the Isle of Man Four fragmentary crosses from the Isle of Man, from Kirk Andreas, Malew, Jurby, and Maughold depict Sigurd stabbing Fafnir from underneath. The crosses also depict the cooking of Fafnir's heart, Sigurd receiving advice from the birds, and potentially his horse Grani. These crosses possibly date to around 1000. There are also a number of depictions from England, likely dating from the period of Norse rule between 1016 and 1042. In Lancashire, the Heysham hogback may depict Sigurd stabbing Fafnir through the belly as well as his horse Grani. It is one of the few monuments on the British Isles that does not appear to have been influenced by Christianity. The nearby Halton cross appears to depict Regin forging Sigurd's sword and Sigurd roasting Fafnir's heart, sucking his thumb. The iconography of these depictions resembles that found on the Isle of Man. In Yorkshire, there are at least three further depictions: a cross fragment at Ripon Cathedral, a cross built into a church at Kirby Hill, and a lost fragment from Kirby Hill that is preserved only as a drawing. The first two attestations depict Sigurd with his finger in his mouth while cooking Fafnir's heart, while the third may depict Fafnir with a sword in his heart. There is also a badly worn gravestone from York Minster that appears to show Regin after having been beheaded and Sigurd with his thumb in his mouth, along with possibly Grani, the fire, and the slain Fafnir.  In Norway  Numerous Norwegian churches from the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries depict scenes from the Sigurd story on their front portals. The most famous of these is the Hylestad Stave Church, likely from around 1200. It shows numerous scenes from Sigurd's legend: Regin is shown in his smithy, Sigurd fights against and kills the dragon, cooks its heart and sucks his burnt thumb, receives the advice of the birds, kills Regin. The most complete sequence is found in the Vegusdal stave church. In some of the depictions, Sigurd appears beside Old Testament heroes such as Samson (stave churches at Lund and Nes). There are also two older stone carvings from Norwegian churches depicting Sigurd killing Fafnir.  Theories about the development of the Sigurd figure  The Ramsund carving in Sweden It is difficult to trace the development of the traditions surrounding Sigurd. If the theory that he has his origins in Sigebert I is correct, then the earliest part of the tradition would be his murder as the result of a feud between two women, in real life between his wife Brunhild of Austrasia and Fredegund, in the saga then between his wife Kriemhild/Gudrun and Br√ºnhild/Brynhild. The earliest attested tradition about Sigurd is his slaying of a dragon, however, which supports the notion that he may have a purely mythological origin, or that he represents the combination of a mythological figure with a historical one. = Relationship to Sigmund and the V√∂lsungs = It is unclear whether Sigurd's descent from the god Odin via V√∂lsung, described only in the V√∂lsunga saga, represents an old common tradition, or whether it is a development unique to the Scandinavian material. Anglo-Saxon, Frankish, and other West Germanic royal genealogies often begin with Wodan or some other mythical ancestor such as Gaut, meaning that it is certainly possible that Sigurd's divine descent is an old tradition. Wolfgang Haubrichs notes that the genealogy of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Deira has a similar prevalence of names beginning with the element Sigi- and that the first ancestor listed is Wodan. Sigurd's relationship to Sigmund, attested as Sigurd's father in both the continental and Scandinavian traditions, has been interpreted in various ways. Notably, references to Sigurd in Scandinavia can only be dated to the eleventh-century, while references to Sigmund in Scandinavia and England, including in Beowulf, can be dated earlier. It is possible that Sigmund's parentage is a later development, as the Scandinavian tradition and the German tradition represented by H√ºrnen Seyfrid locate Sigurd's childhood in the forest and show him to be unaware of his parentage. Catalin Taranu argues that Sigurd only became Sigmund's son to provide the orphan Sigurd with a suitable heroic past. This may have occurred via the story that Sigurd has to avenge his father's death at the hands of the sons of Hunding. The Old English tradition of Sigemund (Sigmund) complicates things even more: in Beowulf Sigmund is said to have slain a dragon and won a hoard. This may be a minor variant of the Sigurd story, or it is possible that the original dragon slayer was Sigmund, and the story was transferred from father to son. Alternatively, it is possible that Sigurd and Sigmund were originally the same figure, and were only later split into father and son. John McKinnell argues that Sigurd only became the dragon-slayer in the mid-eleventh century. Hermann Reichert, on the other hand, argues that the two dragon-slayings are originally unrelated: Sigurd kills one when he is young, which represents a sort of heroic initiation, whereas Sigmund kills a dragon when he is old, which cannot be interpreted in this way. In his view, this makes an original connection between or identity of the two slayings unlikely. = Sigurd's youth = The slaying of the dragon is attested on the eleventh-century Ramsund carving in Sweden, and the G√∂k Runestone, which appears to be a copy of the carving. Both stones depict elements of the story identifiable from the later Norse myths. In both the German and the Scandinavian versions, Sigurd's slaying of the dragon embues him with superhuman abilities. In the Norse sources, Sigurd comes to understand the language of the birds after tasting the dragon's blood and then eating its heart. In the German versions, Siegfried bathes in the dragon's blood, developing a skin that is as hard as horn (Middle High German h√ºrnen). In the continental sources, Sigurd's winning of the hoard of the Nibelungen and slaying of the dragon are two separate events; the Thidrekssaga does not even mention Sigurd's acquiring the hoard. In the Norse tradition, the two events are combined and Sigurd's awakening of Brunhild and avenging of his father are also mentioned, though not in all sources. It is likely that the Norse tradition has substantially reworked the events of Sigurd's youth. Sigurd's liberation of a virgin woman, Brynhild/Br√ºnhild, is only told in Scandinavian sources, but may be an original part of the oral tradition along with the slaying of the dragon, since the Nibelungenlied seems to indicate that Siegfried and Br√ºnhild already know each other. This is not entirely clear, however. It is possible that Siegfried's rescue of Kriemhild (rather than Br√ºnhild) in the late-medieval Lied vom H√ºrnen Seyfrid reflects the tradition that Sigurd liberated a virgin. The origin of the hoard as a cursed ransom paid by the gods is generally taken to be a late and uniquely Scandinavian development. Also attested on the Ramsund Carving, and thus at an early date, is that Sigurd was raised by a smith. While absent in the Nibelungenlied, the Rosengarten and late-medieval Lied vom H√ºrnen Seyfrid show that this tradition was present in Germany as well. = The death of Sigurd and connection to the Burgundians = On the basis of the poem Atlakvi√∞a it is generally believed that Sigurd was not originally connected to the story of the destruction of the Burgundians by Attila (Old Norse Atli, Middle High German Etzel). The earliest text to make this connection is the Nibelungenlied (c. 1200); the combination appears to be older, but it is difficult to say by how much. In the German tradition, this connection led to the change of the role of Sigurd's widow from avenger of her brothers to avenger of her husband on her brothers, again, sometime before the composition of the Nibelungenlied.  Modern reception  Siegfried reforging the sword of the Empire (Reichsschwert), Bismarck-Nationaldenkmal, Berlin, completed 1901. Rhine maidens tease Siegfried. Illustration by Arthur Rackham from Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods, English translation of Wagner's libretto for G√∂tterd√§mmerung (1911). Siegfried remained a popular figure in Germany via Das Lied vom H√ºrnen Seyfrid and its prose version, the Historia vom geh√∂rnten Siegfried, the latter of which was still printed in the nineteenth century. The prose version was popular enough that in 1660 a sequel was written about Siegfried's son with \\"Florigunda\\" (Kriemhild), L√∂whardus. The Nibelungenlied, on the other hand, was forgotten until it was rediscovered in 1755. The majority of the Scandinavian material about Sigurd remained better known through the early modern period to the nineteenth century due to the so-called \\"Scandinavian Renaissance\\", which resulted in knowledge of Eddic poems influencing the popular ballads about Sigurd in Scandinavian folklore. Originally, modern reception of Siegfried in Germany was dominated by a sentimental view of the figure, shown in the many paintings and images produced in this time depicting Siegfried taking leave from Kriemhild, the first encounter of Siegfried and Kriemhild, their wedding, etc. A nationalist tone and attempt to make Siegfried into a national icon and symbol was nevertheless already present in attempts to connect Siegfried to the historical Arminius, who was already established as a national hero in Germany since the sixteenth century. The Norse tradition about Sigurd, which was considered to be more \\"original\\" and Germanic, in many ways replaced direct engagement with the German Nibelungenlied, and was highly influential in the conception of the Siegfried figure in Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (1874). Wagner's portrayal of Siegfried was to influence the modern public's view of the figure immensely. With the founding of the German Empire (1871), the German view of Siegfried became more nationalistic: Siegfried was seen as an identifying epic figure for the new German Empire and his reforging of his father's sword in the Nordic tradition was equated with Otto von Bismarck \\"reuniting\\" the German nation. Numerous paintings, monuments, and fountains of Siegfried date from this time period. Following the defeat of imperial Germany in the First World War, Siegfried's murder by Hagen was extensively used in right-wing propaganda that claimed that leftist German politicians had stabbed the undefeated German army in the back by agreeing to an armistice. This comparison was explicitly made by Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf and by Paul von Hindenburg in his political testament. Nazi propaganda came to use Siegfried \\"to symbolize the qualities of healthy and virile German men.\\" Siegfried's murder by Hagen was further used to illustrate Nazi racial theories about the inherent evilness of certain \\"non-German\\" races, to which Hagen, typically depicted as dark, was seen as belonging. Outside of Germany and Scandinavia, most of the reception of Sigurd has been mediated through, or at least influenced by, his depiction in Wagner's Ring. = Notable adaptations of the legend = * The best-known adaptation of the Sigurd legend is Richard Wagner's cycle of music dramas Der Ring des Nibelungen (written between 1848 and 1874). The Sigurd legend is the basis of Siegfried and contributes to the stories of Die Walk√ºre and G√∂tterd√§mmerung. * William Morris's epic poem Sigurd the Volsung (1876) is a major retelling of the story in English verse. * In 1884 the French composer Ernest Reyer wrote the lesser-known opera Sigurd, which condenses the story into a single evening's drama. * James Baldwin retold the story in a work intended for older children, The Story of Siegfried (1905). * Arthur Peterson published his own poetic adaptation of the Sigurd/Nibelung legend, Andvari's Ring, in 1916. The work consists of two long poems, Sigurd (first published independently in 1910) and Attila.Public domain work available online: https://archive.org/details/andvarisring00pete * Fritz Lang and his then-wife Thea von Harbou adapted the story of Sigurd (called Siegfried) for the first part of their 1924 pair of silent films Die Nibelungen. The two films are primarily based on Nibelungenleid, but also include Norse stories about Siegfried's youth. * J. R. R. Tolkien wrote his version of the Volsunga saga in The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr√∫n about 1930, published posthumously by his son Christopher Tolkien in 2009. The book comprises two narrative poems: \\"The new lay of the Volsungs\\" and \\"The new lay of Gudrun\\". They are in Modern English, but the meter is that of ancient Scandinavian alliterative poetry.

The time line of carbon capture and storage announcements and developments follows: 2009Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute= 10 July 2009 major economies forum meeting on climate change: Australian Prime minister Mr Rudd, who shared the stage with US President Barack Obama, said the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (CCS) would now be an international initiative led by Australia - which will act as a clearing house for research of new technologies, legislation to pave their path and as a vehicle to streamline funding. \\"The practical challenge we face...is what do we do about the problem, the challenge, of coal. There are practically no large carbon capture and storage projects under construction now,\\" Mr Rudd said. \\"Australia in the last 12 months has decided to work with other major economies, and all the major energy companies, on the establishment of a Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. That is what we are here launching today.\\" He said carbon capture and storage, which captures and seeks to inject it in safe stores deep underground, is an important potential future weapon in the battle against global warming. Electricity sourced from fossil fuels accounts for more than 40 per cent of the world's energy-related emissions. A further 25 per cent comes from large- scale industrial processes such as iron and steel production, cement making, natural gas processing and petroleum refining. With world energy demand projected to grow by more than 40 per cent over the next two decades, reducing emissions is a significant challenge the nation of Australia has a particular interest in helping to solve. Australia's is the world's biggest coal exporter, and the Australian economy is heavily dependent upon coal‚Äîits biggest export. Renewable energy technology continues to develop, but fossil fuels, in particular coal and gas, will continue to provide the bulk of the world's energy for the foreseeable future. However, there is a way to harness fossil fuels while significantly reducing CO2 emissions. The answer lies in the capture and storage of carbon dioxide and other climate influencing greenhouse gases. =GreenGen Project led by China Huaneng Group (CHNG) will begin construction in early 2009= GreenGen Project aims to research, develop and demonstrate a coal-based power generation system with hydrogen production through coal gasification, power generation from a combined cycle gas turbine and fuel cells, and efficient treatment of pollutants and CO2. Thus, the efficiency of the coal-based power generation will be greatly improved, and the pollutants and CO2 emissions will be near zero.Development Plan of The GreenGen Co. 2008 Reality campaign launched = 3 December 2008: This Is Reality.org, a coalition of US environmental organisations, launches a campaign to highlight that no fossil fuel power station in the USA captures other than token amounts of the greenhouse gas that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and all other significant scientific organisations acknowledge are causing climate change, global warming, Arctic shrinkage and sea level rise.Retrieved 11 January 2009 =CCS inclusion in CDM postponed= Plans to allow organizations to earn credits for CCS under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) have been dropped at the climate change talks in Poznan Ôºç the 14th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The proposal, led by Australia, was supported by a majority of representatives and the IEA but Brazil and a few other countries blocked the move. The decision will then be postponed until next year. =Carbon assessment software developed= Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) designed a new software that will help developers of clean coal technology to accurately measure how much they can store underground. =BP and CAS established the Clean Energy Commercialization Center= BP and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have agreed to establish the Clean Energy Commercialization Center (CECC), a joint venture in Shanghai investing some $73 million to commercialize Chinese clean energy technologies. Subject to final government approvals, the CECC venture is expected to be established by early 2009. The CECC will serve as an international platform for further collaboration among research institutes, enterprises and other institutions to improve indigenous Chinese innovation capabilities and market applications in areas such as clean coal conversion, zero emission technologies, and carbon capture and storage. =UK Energy Bill received Royal Assent= On 26 November 2008, The UK Energy Bill received Royal Assent and was passed into law. The bill mentions to create a regulatory framework to enable private sector investment in Carbon capture and storage projects. As it has the potential to reduce the carbon emissions from fossil fuel power stations by up to 90%. =The Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute planned= The Australian government in September committed A$100 million annually to help establish an international institute to accelerate development of clean-coal technologies, including the long-term aim of storing carbon dioxide permanently underground. Following a two-day preparatory meeting in London, the institute now has eight foundation industry members: Shell International Petroleum; Rio Tinto Ltd.; Mitsubishi Corp.; Anglo American; Xstrata Coal; Services Petroliers Schlumberger; Alstom; and The Climate Group. =Clean-coal debut in Germany= The world's first coal-fired power plant designed to capture and store carbon dioxide that it produces began operations in Spremberg, Germany. Built alongside the 1,600MW Schwarze Pumpe power plant in north Germany, the demonstration experiment will capture up to 100,000 tonnes of CO2 a year, compress it and bury it 3,000m below the surface of the depleted Altmark gas field, about 200 km from the site. \\"It's a very important and tangible step forward,\\" said Stuart Haszeldine, a geologist and CCS expert at the University of Edinburgh. \\"It is the first full-chain demonstration of oxyfuel as a carbon capture technology. It connects all that for the first time in a working system.\\" =Irish Energy Group launches carbon capture scheme= Providence Resources, an Irish oil and gas group, is launching a project that could lead to the first carbon capture & storage (CCS) scheme in the British Isles. Providence Resources is working with Star Energy Group, a UK gas storage company owned by Petronas of Malaysia, on the Ulysses Project. The scheme will evaluate the Kish Bank Basin in the Irish Sea to decide whether its underground saline reservoirs can be used for carbon sequestration and natural gas storage. =New organic liquids to Capture CO2= Carbon dioxide-binding organic liquids (BOLs) can hold more than twice as much as current capture agents. The liquids could be used in coal power plants to capture the greenhouse gas from combustion exhaust. =The CSIRO and its Chinese partners launched a PCC pilot plant in Beijing= The CSIRO (Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) and its Chinese partners Huaneng Group and the Thermal Power Research Institute (TPRI) have officially launched a post-combustion capture (PCC) pilot plant in Beijing that strips carbon dioxide from power station flue gases in an effort to stem climate change. The project represents another first for the CSIRO PCC program - the first capture of carbon dioxide in China using a PCC pilot plant. It begins the process of applying the technology to Chinese conditions and evaluating its effectiveness. =The US government called for proposals to elicit commercial involvement in FutureGen project= In June 2008, the US government announced a call for proposals to elicit commercial involvement in the restructuring of FutureGen. =The U.S. Department of Energy announced to restructure FutureGen= The United States Department of Energy announced a restructuring of the FutureGen project, which was claimed necessary due to rising costs. =Carbon Capture Journal published the first issue of its print magazine= Carbon Capture Journal is the world's first and only news service, leading to a print magazine, specifically about developments with carbon capture and geological storage technology. The print magazine is published six times a year (bimonthly). It informs people of developments around the world in both power station carbon capture and geological storage, with news about the major projects and developments with government policy. It is produced by the team behind Digital Energy Journal, one of the world's leading magazines and news services for information technology in the oil and gas industry. Digital Energy Journal Ltd, based in central London, was founded in December 2005 by the successful team behind Digital Ship magazine. =Researches and debates on Carbon Capture Ready (CCR) become active= Researches and debates on capture ready become active in 2008, evidences of which consist of IChemEng (Institute of Chemical Engineering) Capture Ready Report, IEA Carbon Capture Ready Report, and CAPPCCO project. The Chinese Advanced Power Plant Carbon Capture Options (CAPPCCO) project is based on a five-year program at Imperial College London, its objective is to research how to make new power plants in China ‚Äòcapture ready‚Äô. 2007Australia and China signed a partnership agreement= On September 6, 2007, Australia and China signed a partnership agreement that will pave the way for the installation of low-emission coal energy technology in Beijing in 2008. Signed by CSIRO Chief Executive, Dr Geoff Garrett, and Mr Li Xiaopeng, the President of China's state-owned energy enterprise, the China Huaneng Group, the agreement will see a post combustion capture pilot plant installed at the Huaneng Beijing Co-generation Power Plant. =The North American Carbon Capture & Storage Association (NACCSA)= Founded in September 2007, the non-profit association supports the development of a commercial CCS industry in the United States and Canada. It is the first of its kind organization in North America to advocate for policies that support the development of a commercial CCS industry. Founding member companies include: BlueSource, Halliburton, International Paper, Keener Oil & Gas Company, Kinder Morgan, MissionPoint Capital Partners, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Peabody Energy, PetroSource Energy Company, Ramgen Power Systems, Schlumberger, and Shell. =BP and Chinese Academy of Sciences signed the MoU to establish the Clean Energy Commercialization Centre= BP and Chinese Academy of Sciences held a ceremony in Shanghai to celebrate the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, announcing their intent to establish the Clean Energy Commercialization Centre. CECC aims to accelerate the development in China of clean coal conversion technologies and the creation of associated value chain investment opportunities through the commercialization of key technologies and coordinated management of large scale demonstration projects which primarily use coal as feedstock for fuel production, chemicals manufacturing and power generation. =Website of Carbon Capture Journal launched= Carbon Capture Journal focuses on industrial carbon capture from power stations and industrial plants and carbon dioxide underground storage, including new technology, policy and projects. Since launching the website in May 2007, it has been actively sought out by the carbon capture world's most influential figures, from power companies, oil and gas companies, government, financiers /banks, researchers, consultants, academics, NGOs, lawyers, engineering companies and technology suppliers. 2006Coach Project - cooperation action within CCS China-EU= The launch meeting for the new European Coach project was held in Beijing on November 21 and 22, 2006. An integral part of the European Commission's FP6, this project falls within the scope of the partnership agreement signed at the start of 2006 between the European Union and China focusing on ways of tackling climate change. The aim of Coach is to provide the technical recommendations required to design a coal-fired power station incorporating CO2 capture and storage technologies, to be constructed in China by 2010. The power station is expected to be industrially operational by 2015. Mature hydrocarbon fields located in Beijing have been identified as potential storage sites. =UK Government faces tough choices on future power= Public consultation on Britain's future energy needs ends with divided camps leaving the government with tough choices on power supplies. Bound by pledges to slash greenhouse gas emissions, the UK government must decide the shape of the country's electricity supply network for coming decades as demand booms and North Sea oil and gas run out. On one side of the debate is the so-called \\"big power\\" lobby promoting coal and nuclear generation. On the other, the green alternative advocating a wider mix of power sources including those coming from individuals' own efforts. 2005Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCSA) established= Established in October 2005, CCSA encourages the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in UK, and plays an important role in delivering CCS technologies and projects worldwide. 11 founding companies consist of BP, Mitsui Babcock, Schlumberger, Scottish & Southern Energy, Shell, etc. =NZEC agreement (Near Zero Emissions Coal Project)= The EU-China NZEC agreement was signed at the EU-China Summit under the UK's presidency of the EU in September 2005 as part of the EU-China Partnership on Climate Change. The agreement has the objective of demonstrating advanced, near zero emissions coal technology through CCS in China and the EU by 2020. The Sino-UK bilateral NZEC initiative was developed in support of this wider agreement. The joint Sino-UK Near Zero Emissions Coal initiative is sponsored by UK's Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), together with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR), and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of the People's Republic of China. =The Scottish Centre for Carbon Storage established= The Scottish Centre for Carbon Storage was set up in September 2005. This collaboration between the University of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University as well as the British Geological Survey, builds on and extends established expertise. The Centre comprises experimental and analytical facilities, expertise in field studies and modelling, and key academic and research personnel to stimulate the development of innovative solutions to carbon capture and geological storage. =The new Norwegian government aims to make Norway the forerunner in CCS= The new Norwegian government that came into power in the autumn of 2005 aims to make Norway the forerunner in CO2 capture and storage. It has also made a commitment to ensure that gas-fired power plants will be equipped with capture technology, and has allocated a total of ‚Ç¨19 million to related R&D; to be distributed through a new organization called Gassnova. The country has also intensified its international collaboration in the field, e.g., with the UK. =The UK Carbon Capture and Storage Consortium (UKCCSC) started= UKCCSC is a consortium of engineering, technological, natural, environmental, social and economic scientists, as a way to expand UK research capacity in carbon capture and storage. Its CCS objectives consist of: ‚Ä¢ Assess impact of future energy supply/demand scenarios on overall costs/emissions of non-CCS and CCS fossil generation ‚Ä¢ Explore role of CCS in the update of the UK's energy infrastructure ‚Ä¢ Investigate potential impacts of CO2 leakage during capture and storage, and compare these to environmental impacts of non-intervention =EU Emission Trading Scheme commenced operation= The European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) commenced operation in January 2005 as the largest multi-country, multi-sector Greenhouse Gas emission trading scheme worldwide. =CCS technology was integrated into Chinese national development plan= In 2005, the CCS technology was integrated into Chinese National Medium- and Long-term Science and Technology Development Plan towards 2020(2006‚Äì2020) 2004CO2 Capture Project Phase IIÔºàCCP2ÔºâÔºö2004Ôºç2008= The targets of Phase II consist of: *Achieve significant progress for each technology: ** Scaling-up successfully operation by at least one order of magnitude. ** Addressing and solving critical issues identified in Phase I * Confirm or improve economical evaluations of Phase I. * At least one technology ready for field demonstration 2003The U.S. Department of Energy named the seven regional partnerships on CCS= The U.S. Department of Energy on August 18, 2003 named the seven partnerships of state agencies, universities, and private companies that will form the core of a nationwide network to help determine the best approaches for capturing and permanently storing gases that can contribute to global climate change. The Regional Sequestration Partnership Program supports region-specific studies to determine the most suitable CCS technologies, regulations, and infrastructure. The seven partnerships consist of Big Sky Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership, Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium (Illinois Basin), Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership, Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership, Southwest Regional Partnership for Carbon Sequestration, Plains CO2 Reduction Partnership, and West Coast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership. =Tsinghua-BP Clean Energy Research and Education Centre was launched= Under the \\"Clean Energy: Facing the Future\\" Programme, the Tsinghua-BP Clean Energy Research and Education Centre was launched in July 2003. It aims to combine the strengths to create a \\"world- leading institute for energy strategy study for China\\". It has attracted a broad range of important players in various aspects of energy, industry and environment to serve on the Advisory Board of the Centre. =The inaugural meeting of the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF) was held.= The inaugural meeting of CSLF was held in Tysons Corner, Virginia, USA in June 2003. Thirteen countries and the European Commission signed the CSLF charter as part of this ministerial summit. The Charter committed each country to participate in the CSLF process, and specifically to provide both policy and technical expertise through a formal working group structure. CSLF is an international climate change initiative focusing on the development of carbon capture and storage technologies as a means to accomplishing long-term stabilization of GHG levels in the atmosphere. It is designed to improve CCS technologies through coordinated research and development with international partners and private industry. =The US federal government announced FutureGen Project= On February 27, 2003, the US federal government announced FutureGen, a $1 billion initiative to create a coal-based power plant focused on demonstrating a revolutionary clean coal technology that would produce hydrogen and electricity and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The FutureGen project was initiated in response to the National Energy Policy of May 2001, which emphasized the need for diverse and secure energy sources that could largely be provided by America's most abundant domestic energy resource, coal. =U.S. Department of Energy budget for carbon capture and storage research= One sign of the increased seriousness with which policymakers view the potential for CCS is the budget devoted by the U.S. Department of Energy to research on CCS, which has increased from about $1 million in 1998 to a 2003 budget request of $54 million, just five years later. (1998- $1mln, 1999- $6mln, 2000- $9mln, 2001- $18mln, 2002- $32mln, 2003- $54mln) 2002IPCC decided to hold a workshop to do a literature on CCS= In April 2002, at its 19th Session in Geneva, the IPCC decided to hold a workshop, which took place in November 2002 in Regina, Canada. The results of this workshop were a first assessment of literature on capture and storage, and a proposal for a Special Report. At its 20th Session in 2003 in Paris, France, the IPCC endorsed this proposal and agreed on the outline and timetable for the special report. 2001‚ÄòClean Energy: Facing the Future‚Äô Programme= In November 2001, BP established the \\"Clean Energy: Facing the Future\\" Programme in China with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Tsinghua University to create a partnership within China to address the issues and opportunities of clean energy. BP is providing $10 million over a ten-year period to fund research in new clean energy technologies. This programme aims to develop and prove new clean options for China and the rest of the world. The programme includes several projects at CAS's Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics and Shenyang Institute of Metals Research. =The RECOPOL project started on November 1, 2001.= RECOPOL stands for: 'Reduction of CO2 emission by means of storage in coal seams in the Silesian Coal Basin of Poland'. It is an EU co-funded combined research and demonstration project to investigate the possibility of permanent subsurface storage of CO2 in coal. At a selected location in Poland a pilot installation is developed for methane gas production from coal beds while simultaneously storing CO2 underground. The produced methane could become an alternative fuel that can be locally produced in Silesia. This installation is the very first of its kind in Europe, and at the moment the only one operational worldwide. =The UNFCCC invited IPCC to prepare a special report on CCS technologies= The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at its seventh Conference of Parties (COP7) in 2001 invited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to prepare a special report on carbon capture and storage technologies. 2000The Carbon Sequestration Initiative launched= As a major component of the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies Program at MIT, the Carbon Sequestration Initiative (CSI) was launched in July 2000. CSI is an industrial consortium formed to investigate CCS technologies, it aims to: *Provide an objective source of assessment and information about carbon sequestration. *Establish a members' information network to provide timely updates on relevant activities and new findings. *Explore the societal and technical aspects of carbon sequestration. *Educate a wider audience on the possibilities of carbon sequestration. *Link industry to expanding government activities on these topics. *Stimulate and seed new research ideas. *Create an annual forum for strategic thinking and identification of new business opportunities. =CCP Phase I: April 2000-December 2003= The CO2 Capture Project (CCP) is a partnership of eight of the world's leading energy companies and three government organizations undertaking research and developing technologies to help make CCS a practical reality for reducing global CO2 emissions and tackling climate change.

In late 2000, injection was initiated at an initial injection rate of 2.69 million m3/d (or 5000 t/d) into 19 patterns. Before 20001998=EnCana announced plans to implement Weyburn EOR project In 1998, a Canadian oil and gas corporation (the PanCanadian Petroleum Limited, now EnCana Corporation) announced plans to implement a large scale EOR project in an oilfield near Weyburn, Saskatchewan, Canada, using captured from Dakota Gasification Company. The Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project provided a chance to demonstrate and study a large-scale geological storage project and to provide the data to evaluate the safety, technical and economic feasibility of such storage. =1997=DGC agreed to send all of the waste gas (96% ) to the Weyburn oil field The Weyburn oil field is situated in Canada, near the USA border. The carbon dioxide for the Weyburn EOR project is produced in the Great Plains Synfuels Plant in Beulah, North Dakota, USA, which is operated by the Dakota Gasification Company. In 1997, DGC agreed to send all of the waste gas (96% ) from its Great Plains Synfuels Plant through a pipeline to the Weyburn oil field. =1996=Sleipner ‚Äî a carbon dioxide capture-and-storage project The Sleipner gas field is in the North Sea, about 250 km west of Stavanger, Norway. It is operated by Norway's largest oil company Statoil. The Sleipner field produces natural gas and light oil from the Heimdal sandstones, which are about 2,500 m below sea level. The natural gas produced at Sleipner contains unusually high levels (about 9%) of carbon dioxide, but the customers require less than 2.5%. To encourage companies to cut their carbon emissions, the Norwegian government imposes a carbon tax equivalent to about $50 per ton of CO2 released into the atmosphere. To avoid paying the tax, and as a test of alternative technology, all of the CO2 extracted since 1996, when gas production started at Sleipner, has been pumped back deep underground. The Sleipner project is the first commercial example of CO2 storage in a deep saline aquifer, so there is a lot of interest from around the world in its success. In particular, scientists want to know how the CO2 moves inside the aquifer and if there is a risk that it could escape back to the surface. =1991=The Norwegian government instituted a tax on emissions In 1991, the Norwegian government instituted a tax on emissions, which motivated Statoil to capture the emitted from its Sleipner oil and gas field in the North Sea and inject it into an underground aquifer. =1989=The Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies Program at MIT initiated Initiated in 1989, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies Program at MIT conducts research into technologies to capture, utilize, and store from large stationary sources. It is globally recognized as a leader in the field of carbon capture and storage research. =Early 1970s=The use of for commercial EOR began in US in the early 1970s. The use of for commercial enhanced oil recovery started in USA in the early 1970s. There are currently about 120 registered CO2 floods worldwide, almost 85% of which are in the United States and Canada.ÂÖ®ÁêÉÁ¢≥ÊçïÈõÜ‰∏éÂ∞ÅÂ≠ò‰ø°ÊÅØ‰∏≠ÂøÉ http://www.captureready.com References Category:Carbon capture and sequestration Category:Environmental timelines ","title":"Timeline of carbon capture and storage"},{"id":"20936373","text":"The Horse Memorial is a provincial heritage site in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, in memory of the horses that served and died during the Second Boer War, where Britain brought a large number of horses to South Africa. Designed by Joseph Whitehead, the life-sized bronze memorial features a kneeling soldier presenting a bucket of water to a service horse. History A horse bound for the front is offloaded at Port Elizabeth during the Second Boer War During the Second Boer War, Britain brought a large number of horses to South Africa; it is estimated that the total cost of all the horses acquired for the war was around . More than 300,000 horses died in British service in South Africa. One of the principal reasons for Port Elizabeth taking such an interest in the movement, which started in 1901, was the fact that most of the horses brought to this country were landed there. The horses were shipped from all over the world, including 50,000 from the United States and 35,000 from Australia. A ladies committee was formed with Mrs Harriet Meyer as president and ¬£800 was collected for Messrs Whitehead and Sons, of Kennington and Westminster, to erect the statue. The statue was originally located close to the junction of Park Drive and Rink Street, next to St George's Park, but was moved to its present position in Cape Road in the 1950s. The Mayor said in his unveiling speech: Design The horse stands , and the figure of the soldier is life size. In addition to the memorial proper, there is a drinking trough for horses and cattle, and the wants of the thirsty wayfarer are also provided for. The design as a whole is an object lesson in kindness, and may appeal to the cruel or careless driver, and teach him that there are some who do not think it beneath them to attend to the wants of animals placed under their charge. The memorial was described in the Government Gazette asThe inscription on the base reads:  Vandalism  On 6 April 2015, the memorial was vandalised by a group of men suspected to be associated with the Economic Freedom Fighters. The monument was one of a number of colonial era statues and memorials vandalised after the spread of the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, in March 2015, which aimed to move a statue of Cecil John Rhodes from the University of Cape Town.

It is situated at the meeting point of five roads, and commemorates those who died defending the city during the Siege of Kimberley in the Anglo-Boer War. In 1986, it was described in the Government Gazette as Rhodes sent Baker to Greece to study ancient memorials - the Nereid Monument at Xanthus greatly influenced his design. The monument is built of sandstone quarried in the Matopo Hills in Zimbabwe and is the tomb of 27 soldiers. It features an inscription that Rhodes specifically commissioned Rudyard Kipling to write. The Long Cecil gun that was designed and manufactured by George Labram in the workshops of De Beers during the siege is mounted on its stylobate (facing the Free State). It is surrounded by shells from the Boer Long Tom. The memorial was dedicated on 28 November 1904. It was vandalised in 2010 when brass fittings were broken off parts of the gun.

Above the frieze are two more storeys of diminishing size, dominated by mandala motifs on the four sides and corners. Above the main entrance is a decorative feature made up of three arched panels which form a short parapet to the flat roof of the hall. On the left hand side of the porch, to the south of the main hall, is a statue of a vole, and to the right of the porch is a statue of a peacock. At the northern end of the main hall (mandabulum) are three image cells of Narainsamy, Ganesta and Surbahmanya. In the west wall is an opening leading into a large cell (Nataraja).

In March 1980, the band's only studio album, Instant Classic, was released, reaching No. 16 on the UK Indie Chart, and two singles followed, both indie hits, but not selling as well as their earlier single, before the band split up in March 1982. Cherry Red subsidiary Anagram Records issued a compilation of the band's output, Instant Punk Classics, in 1994. The band reformed for a performance at the first Wasted/Holidays in the Sun festival in 1996, and reformed more permanently in 2005 with the original line-up. The song \\"I'm In Love with Margaret Thatcher\\" was featured in the 2011 film The Iron Lady starring Meryl Streep. The single was re-released on vinyl and download to celebrate its appearance in the film. In 2013, after Baroness Thatcher's death, \\"I'm in Love with Margaret Thatcher\\" received additional publicity when there was an online campaign to boost the record's re-entry into the charts as a download, to counter the promotion of the song \\"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\\" by anti-Thatcher activists. The campaign was initiated by Notsensibles' singer Mike Hargreaves and promoter Suzie Delooze by way of a Facebook page, and was endorsed by Thatcher supporters. Although the Notsensibles' song was reportedly considered \\"more favourable to Baroness Thatcher\\", band member Steven Hartley commented that it had been written as a satirical swipe at her. Hargreaves said: \\"I find it hilarious that Tories have adopted it. The song is a sort-of tribute and sort-of not.\\" The song charted at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart on 12 April 2013. At the time of the renewed success of the single in 2013, it was reported that Hartley had trained as a doctor and now worked in accident and emergency; Rawlinson was a tree surgeon working for the local council; Hargreaves worked as a nurse; Brown worked in IT; and Hemingway was a businessman.

Although he criticizes this view in earlier works, the term in this form is introduced in his 2005 book \\"Our Inner Ape\\", denoting a concept that he rejects, namely that human morality is \\"a cultural overlay, a thin veneer hiding an otherwise selfish and brutish nature\\". The idea of the veneer theory goes back to Thomas Henry Huxley and has more recently been advocated by biologists like George C. Williams. Proponents of the theory As evidenced by de Waals' characterisation of this theory as \\"Hobbesian\\", one of the earliest and most influential thinkers criticized by him for having popularized this view is Thomas Hobbes: A few centuries later, Thomas Henry Huxley developed the idea that moral tendencies are not part of the human nature, and so our ancestors became moral by choice, not by evolution. Thus it represents a discrepancy in Huxley's Darwinian conviction. Social behavior is explained by this theory as a veneer of morality. This dualistic point of view separates humans from animals by rejecting every connection between human morality and animal social tendencies. George C. Williams, as another advocate of the veneer theory, sees morality as \\"an accidental capability produced, in its boundless stupidity, by a biological process that is normally opposed to the expression of such a capability\\". Psychologist Abraham Maslow argued that humans no longer have instincts because we have the ability to override them in certain situations. He felt that what is called instinct is often imprecisely defined, and really amounts to strong drives. For Maslow, an instinct is something which cannot be overridden, and therefore while the term may have applied to humans in the past, it no longer does. Richard Dawkins seems to condone the veneer theory when he writes: Some argue that veneer theory presents a false dichotomy; the adaptations of a cultural overlay of pseudo morals, and de Waal's biologically-based morals might coexist, and are both evolutionarily advantageous. Critics of the theory De Waal criticizes the veneer theory and sees our morality as a direct outgrowth of the social instincts human beings share with other animals. He argues that the advocates of the veneer theory don't have any indications or empirical evidence which support the theory, and that it is highly unlikely that humans can deny their genes and improve morality merely by choice. As an example he compares Huxley's theory with a school of piranhas deciding to become vegetarian. De Waal bases his argument against the veneer theory on observations of behavior of humanity's relatives in his long work as primatologist. \\"Building blocks of morality\\" can be already observed in other primates, and by the principle of parsimony, it is quite possible that some sort of morality is evolutionarily ancient and shared with our ancestors. De Waal assumes that the evolutionary origins lie in emotions we share with other animals, e.g. empathy. Human morality is according to him a product of social evolution, and instead of Huxley's theory, this point of view a continuity between human morality and animal social tendencies‚Äîis unitary and thus more compatible with the evolutionary theory. Other critics of the veneer theory are Edward Westermarck and E. O. Wilson and Rutger Bregman. Psychologist Christopher Ryan and psychiatrist Cacilda Jeth√° also express similar concerns in their book Sex at Dawn, where they criticize what they call the \\"neo- Hobbesian\\" narrative of human nature: They also cite Stephen Jay Gould as a critic of this view: See also * Animal faith * Evolution of morality * Social evolution * Theory of mind References Category:Primatology Category:Sociological theories ","title":"Veneer theory"},{"id":"20936731","text":"Route 515, or Highway 515, may refer to: Afghanistan *Route 515 (Afghanistan) in Farah Province Canada *31px Alberta Highway 515 *31px New Brunswick Route 515 *31px Ontario Highway 515 (former) India *20px National Highway 515 (India) United Kingdom *20px A515 road United States * 25px Interstate 515 (concurrent with U.S. routes 93 and 95) * 25px Lake County, California County Route 515 * 25px Brevard, Florida County Route 515 * 25px Georgia State Route 515 * 25px Maryland Route 515 * 25px County Route 515 (New Jersey) * 25px North Carolina Highway 515 (former) * 25px Ohio State Route 515 * 25px Pennsylvania Route 515 (former) * 25px Virginia State Route 515 (former) * 25px Washington State Route 515 ;Territories: * 25px Puerto Rico Highway 515 ","title":"List of highways numbered 515"},{"id":"20936734","text":"300px HP TouchSmart is a series of tablet PC laptops and touchscreen all-in- one desktop computers designed by HP.

It is an adaptation of Pavel Bazhov's story of the same name, in turn based on Ural region Russian folklore. It also incorporates plot elements from the stories \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\" and \\"The Master Craftsman\\". The Stone Flower was theatrically released by Mosfilm on 28 April 1946. It was the Soviet Union's first color film shot on Agfacolor negative film seized in Germany, and was entered into the 1946 Cannes Film Festival. It was a success at the box-office in the year 1946 in USSR, it was seen by 23,17 million viewers. Plot The story is told from the point of view the old storyteller Slyshko. The skilled gemcutter Prokopych is getting old, and the landlord's bailiff forces him to take an apprentice. Prokopych tries to teach several boys, but none of them understands \\"the soul of stone\\". Eventually he picks a young boy Danilo, who appears to be very scatterbrain and careless in everything else, but shows extreme talent in shaping gemstones and creating patterns. He quickly surpasses his old teacher, who takes a liking to him. Prokopych decides to keep him away from the craft for the time being because gemcutting can seriously damage health. Years pass. One day the landlord summons Prokopych. He announces that he has been to France and visited a marquess, who showed him the beautifully crafted casket; the landlord started bragging that he had \\"a better one at home\\", and they made a bet that the landlord's casket would prove more beautiful. He now needs to present the casket, so he orders Prokopych to make one that should be so beautiful that \\"you will not be able to take your eyes of it\\". Prokopych works day and night, but fails to think of an original design. Danilo makes the malachite casket for him. The landlord's wife is very satisfied with his work and orders a stone cup \\"that would look exactly like a flower\\". Danilo starts working on the cup. He wants to create something outstanding to reveal \\"the full power of stone\\". Prokopych scolds him for trying too hard for no good reason, but secretly admires Danilo's determination. He believes that it is a sign of the expert craftsman. Danilo works on his flower cup for several months, paying little attention to his fianc√©e Katinka. After he finishes the cup, every villager admires his work, but Danilo is unhappy. He feels that there is no true \\"living\\" beauty in his malachite cup, yet he wants to collect \\"all the beauty of the real flower\\" and convey it though stone. An old craftsman warns him against walking this path, otherwise he might end up as one of the Mistress of the Copper Mountain's craftsmen. Those craftsmen understood the beauty of stone after they saw the legendary Stone Flower. However, those who saw the Flower never wanted to go back from the Mistress' domain. Katinka asks her beloved to forget about the Stone Flower, but he is tempted. Danilo finally decides to marry Katinka. Nevertheless, at the wedding he goes back to his room, destroys his flower cup and goes to the mine. He begs the Mistress of the Copper Mountain to show him the Stone Flower. She warns him that he would never want to go back to people after seeing it, and reminds him of Katinka. He replies that he does not feel alive anyway. In the domain of the Mistress, he finally sees the Flower. He stays there, working on the new cup. Danilo is saddened by the fact that his work, albeit marvellous, will never be seen by people. He admits that he thinks about Katinka day and night, but the Mistress of the Copper Mountain claims that she is jealous and refuses to let him go. She asks him to marry her, but Danilo refuses. Katinka never marries another, believing that Danilo is still alive. She moves in with Prokopych and takes care of the old man. He teaches her some gemcutting. Although he believes that this is not \\"a woman's craft\\", Katinka's work is good. She earns enough money to make ends meet. While searching for some good stones in the forest, Katinka meets the Mistress of the Copper Mountain and demands that she let her beloved go. Inside the mine, Katinka rejoins with Danilo. The Mistress praises Danilo for his honor and fidelity, and says that the couple passed her test. She presents a casket filled with jewellery for Katinka, and rewards Danilo by letting him remember all that he learned at her domain. Danilo and Katinka leave together. Differences from the book The film did add or change some events in the canon. Most importantly, the romantic subplot between Danilo and the Mistress of the Copper Mountain was added. In \\"The Stone Flower\\", the Mistress neither display jealousy of the protagonist nor proposed to marry him. That happened with Stepan in \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\". In that story, she asked the protagonist (named Stepan) to marry her, but he refused. Cast * Vladimir Druzhnikov as Danilo * Yekaterina Derevshchikova as Katinka, a village girl and Danilo's romantic interest * Tamara Makarova as The Mistress of the Copper Mountain * Mikhail Troyanovsky as Prokopych * Aleksandr Kleberer as The Old Storyteller Slyshko * Vitaly Kravchenko as Young Danilo * Nikolai Orlov as The Old Craftsman * Anna Petukhova as The Landlord's wife * Nikolay Temyakov as The Landlord * Mikhail Yanshin as Severyan the Bailiff * Lidia Deikun as The Old Woman Vikhorika * Serafim Zaytsev as Yefimka Reception and legacy The film popularized a Russian catchphrase \\"How did that Stone Flower come out?\\" (, lit. \\"Naught came of your Stone Flower?\\"), derived from this dialogue from the original fairy tale: > \\"Well, Danilo the Craftsman, so naught came of your thornapple?\\" > \\"No, naught came of it,\\" he said. Bazhov liked the film, mostly the actors' performances. However he said that there was \\"little Ural\\" in it, for example there was a scene where people sing \\"Kalinka\\" as if \\"there are no good Ural songs\\".

The experiment studies the hadronic final states produced in interactions of various beam particles (pions, protons and beryllium, argon, and xenon nuclei) with a variety of fixed nuclear targets at the SPS energies. About 135 physicists from 14 countries and 35 institutions work in NA61/SHINE, led by Marek Gazdzicki. NA61/SHINE is the second largest fixed target experiment at CERN.  Physics program  The NA61/SHINE physics program has been designed to measure hadron production in three different types of collisions: *In nucleus‚Äìnucleus (heavy ion) collisions, in particular the measurement of fluctuations and long range correlations, with the aim to identify the properties of the onset of deconfinement and find evidence for the critical point of strongly interacting matter. *In proton‚Äìproton and proton‚Äìnucleus interactions needed as reference data for better understanding of nucleus‚Äìnucleus reactions; in particular with regards to correlations, fluctuations and high transverse momenta. *In hadron‚Äìnucleus interactions needed for neutrino (T2K) and cosmic-ray experiments (Pierre Auger Observatory and KASCADE).  Detector  The NA61/SHINE experiment uses a large acceptance hadron spectrometer located on the H2 beam line in the North Area of CERN. It consist of components used by the heavy ion NA49 experiment as well as those designed and constructed for NA61/SHINE. The main tracking devices are four large volume time projection chambers (TPCs), which are capable of detecting up to 70% of all charged particles created in the studied reactions. Two of them are located in the magnetic field of two super-conducting dipole magnets with maximum bending powers of 9 Tesla meters. Two others are positioned downstream of the magnets symmetrically with respect to the beam line. Additionally, four small volume TPCs placed directly along the beamline region are used in case of hadron and light ion beams. The setup is supplemented by time of flight detector walls, which extend particle identification to low momenta ( < p ). Furthermore, the Projectile Spectator Detector (a calorimeter) is positioned downstream of the time of flight detectors to measure energy of projectile fragments.

Extended program: after Long Shutdown 2  In 2018 the NA61/SHINE collaboration published an addendum presenting an intent to upgrade the experimental facility and perform a new set of measurements after Long Shutdown 2. As in the original program, the new one proposes studies of hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions for heavy ions, neutrino and cosmic-ray physics. The heavy ions program will focus on study of charm hadron production (mostly D mesons) in lead-lead interactions. In 2020 the SPS and PS Experiments Committee (SPSC) recommended approval of beam time in 2021. The Research Board endorsed these recommendations.

Today his instruments are highly regarded, though quite rare. They are played by musicians such as Joseph Szigeti. Biography Pietro Guarneri was the eldest son of the master luthier Andrea Guarneri and Anna Maria di Orcelli, born in Cremona, Italy on the 18th of February 1655. Although the exact date he began working in his father's workshop is unknown, experts have found traces of his workmanship beginning about 1670 in instruments labeled as Andrea Guarneri. His work appears in many instruments between 1670 and 1678, and some seem to be wholly his own work though, unlike his younger brother Giuseppe filius Andrea Guarneri, he never used his own label while working with their father. His early work shows not only promising ability and craftsmanship, but also a pronounced tendency to express his own personality and follow his own ideas. He quickly developed his own style, noticeable in its distinctive f-holes, precise corners and purfling, and a fuller arching than his father used. Evidence from his father's will indicates that father and son did not work together in the family workshop harmoniously, and Pietro left Cremona altogether in 1679, eventually establishing himself in Mantua. In 1677 Pietro married Caterina Sassagni, and they had a son in the following year. In 1694, he appears in the census in Mantua as having remarried to Lucia Guidi, and having five children, none of whom followed their father into violin making. Even while he was in Cremona violin making was not his only interest. He also developed himself as a violin and viol player. By 1685, he was accomplished enough to perform for the Duke of Mantua as a violin soloist, and play a viol in the Mantuan Court Orchestra. His musicianship is unique among the great Italian violin makers of the classical period. He is the only one who left any record of musical ability, and certainly the only one who pursued both violin making and performing professionally. He also appears to be the earliest known violin maker in the city of Mantua, though doubtless there were many viol and lute makers. The city was already famous for its music, being home to the composer Monteverdi and Duke Vincenzo I of Gonzaga, a composer and patron of the arts. His performing resulted in his making few instruments. Today not more than fifty of his violins are thought to exist, and there are no known violas or violoncelli.* =Footnotes= *Although William Henry Hill states that there are no Pietro Guarneri violoncelli in his 1931 book The Violin Makers of the Guarneri Family: Their Life and Work, in 1951 Emil Herrmann, a respected authority on stringed instruments, certified a 'cello that was labeled and had been previously attributed to Andrea Guarneri as made by his son Pietro Cozio.com Identification and pricing of old string instruments. Instruments Pietro inherited from his father basics of the Amati form and concept of the violin, but his style quickly developed as distinctly his own. His workmanship was much finer and more controlled than his father's, and his instruments demonstrate a harmony of elements rarely equaled by his father, which indicates a superior eye for form. The earliest instrument that exhibits Pietro's personal label is dated 1685, and was made in Mantua. This instrument's curves are slightly stiffened and elongated in a Stradivarian style. In general Pietro's instruments were the standard 14 inches long, and tended to be of a narrow pattern with rather elongated bouts. The corners and edgework were light, delicate and deeply fluted. His f-holes were based on an Amati template, but the top and bottom holes were larger than any Amati's, and the nicks more deeply cut. Even before he left his father's workshop, Pietro experimented with ornamentation on his instruments, possibly to increase their value. He sometimes added fleur-de-lis at the corners and at times added a second line of purfling. However his attempts at embellishment always fell short those he was probably copying: Nicol√≤ Amati and Antonio Stradivari. From 1700 onward, he abandoned the Amati-like delicacy of his earlier work and adopted a larger, more masculine style. His model remained basically the same, though with increased width, enlarged edges, corners and f-holes. His massive scrolls are especially distinctive in this period, with the intermediate turn of the volute being left so high that the eyes appear dwarfed. Throughout his career Pietro Guarneri was fastidious in his choice of wood. He accepted no compromises, and his maple is often of foreign growth and exceptional appearance. His varnish, likewise, was first quality, ranging in colour from golden-brown to orange to a brilliant red.

Dedicated to Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, it was traditionally considered to commemorate the spot where the legendary figures Romulus and Tatius concluded the peace treaty between the tribes known as the Latins ‚Äî on the Palatine Hill ‚Äî and the Sabines ‚Äî on the Quirinal and Esquiline.Grant, Michael (1970), The Roman Forum, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson; Photos by Werner Forman, pg 214. This famous merger of the hill- villages was said to be the foundation of the Roman state.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, II, 50, 54. Description The original Vulcanal was an open-air altar on the slopes of the Capitoline Hill in Rome in the area that would later become the Comitium and Roman Forum. It was located in the open here, between the hill-villages, in the days before Rome existed, because the fire god was considered to be too destructive to be located anywhere near an occupied house. (He was mainly worshiped in order to avert fires.) It contained a lotus tree and cypress tree long honored as being older than the city of Rome itself. According to literary sources, the site originally featured a sculpture of a four-horse chariot (quadriga) celebrating Romulus' victory over the Caeninenses (citizens of Caenina) ‚Äî and said to have been dedicated by Romulus himself. This was later supplemented with a statue of that king, inscribed with Greek letters and celebrating his deeds.Grant, Op. cit. Other monuments erected here from the earliest times included a statue of Horatius Cocles and another standing on a column and representing an actor who had been struck by lightning during the games in the Circus Maximus. Behind the excavated foundation of the altar of Vulcan are traces of a flight of steps, cut into the tufa of the Capitoline Hill, which lead up to the vestibule of the Temple of Concord, just to the northwest.H√ºlsen, Christian (1906), The Roman Forum: Its History and Its Monuments; Ermanno Loescher & Co. History In addition to its function as a place of worship, the Vulcanal became the Assembly place during the Roman monarchy in the days before the Comitium and Old Rostra (Rostra Vetera) existed. According to longstanding Roman tradition, the Vulcanal served as the speaker's platform at this time,H√ºlsen, Op. cit. a function much later assumed by the immediately adjacent Rostra. The archaic site had long been reverently preserved when, in 9 AD, the Emperor Augustus refurbished it with a new marble altar (discovered in 1548 and now in the Naples Museum). The Emperor Domitian (r. 81-96 AD) did likewise, presenting a new marble-faced altar and sacrificing a red calf and boar. Later in the Imperial period, the Vulcanal area suffered by being very much narrowed and partly done away with altogether by building operations associated with the enlargement of the Temple of Concord, the construction of the adjacent Arch of Severus, and other public works.H√ºlsen, Op. cit. Location The precise location of the Vulcanal within what is now the west end of the Roman Forum is not completely settled.Bartels, Aaron David (2009), Paving the Past: Late Republican Recollections in the Forum Romanum, The University of Texas at Austin [Master of Arts Thesis], pg 90, etc. Two sites have been seriously proposed. Giacomo Boni, who excavated extensively in this area in 1899‚Äì1905, established a site about 40 meters to the southwest of the Lapis Niger as the Vulcanal. This is just behind the Umbilicus UrbiH√ºlsen, Op. cit. and the (future) New Rostra (Rostra Augusti).Richardson, Jr., L. (1992), A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, pg 432. Boni uncovered a small shrine here that had been cut directly out of the natural tufa and had tufa blocks defining a precinct area (identified from literary sources as the Area VolcaniH√ºlsen, Op. cit.). This excavated site is about 13 by 9 feet, but the original Vulcanal is thought to have been somewhat larger. Boni's identification of this spot as the Vulcanal stood virtually unchallenged for over 80 years. In 1983, however, Filippo Coarelli associated the Vulcanal with the site (also uncovered by Boni decades before) that by Imperial times had become known as the Lapis Niger.Coarelli, Op. cit. This archaic (8th century BC) sacred site may have been more or less contemporary with the Vulcanal. An altar (known as \\"Altar G-H\\" to archeologists) had also been found here and Coarelli suggested that the Vulcanal may not only have been associated with it, but may have been identical with this shrine. (According to him, the altar identified by Boni as the Vulcanal was actually the Ara Saturni, or Altar of Saturn). Coarelli's hypothesis has received a mixed reception. While a number of authorities believe he is correct,Wiseman praised Coarelli‚Äôs ‚Äúaccomplishment‚Äù in establishing the new location. Wiseman, Timothy Peter (1985), Review of Foro Romano: Periodo Arcaico; The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora, by Filippo Coarelli; James C. Anderson. The Journal of Roman Studies 75., pg 230.Versnel believed that ‚ÄúCoarelli convincingly demonstrates‚Äù the new location. Versnel, H.S. (1994), Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion, Volume II: Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual; Leiden: E.J. Brill, pg 172. other experts continue to insist that Boni's site is the correct one. For example, Richardson's authoritative A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, published almost 10 years after Coarelli's work, has this to say: > The Vulcanal was distinctly higher than the forum...and Comitium...[T]he > kings and magistrates transacted public business there...public assemblies > were regularly held there.... [It] was also big enough to include a bronze > aedicula.... All this taken together indicates that originally the Vulcanal > covered the lower slope of the Capitoline along the stair that extended the > line of the Sacra Via up the hill, an area later covered by the Temple of > Concordia.Richardson, Op. cit.

This murder by Tostig led to a great northern revolt against Edward the Confessor, a revolt that turned both King Edward and Harold Godwinson against Tostig and led to the appointment of the Mercian, Morcar, as Earl of northern England.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, pp. 157‚Äî62; Kapelle, Norman Conquest of the North, p. 95. Eadulf is primarily remembered for his involvement in the death of William Walcher, Earl of Northumbria and Bishop of Durham. The sources says that the attack occurred as revenge for the murder of Walcher's English right-hand man, Ligulf.See Kapelle, Norman Conquest of the North, pp. 139, 270‚Äî1, n. 73. Ligulf had been connected into the Bamburgh kindred marrying, according to the Historia Regum, Ealdgyth daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bamburgh.Stevenson, Symeon of Durham's History, p. 150. The Worcester Chronicle and the Historia Regum allege that the murder of Ligulf was planned by Walcher's chaplain Leobwin after Ligulf had argued with him during one of the earl's councils.Kapelle, Norman Conquest of the North, pp. 270‚Äî1, n. 73; see also Stevenson, Symeon of Durham's History, p. 150. It was Walcher's kinsman Gilbert, however, who is alleged to have entered Ligulf's hall, and attacked and killed him.Kapelle, Norman Conquest of the North, p. 139; Stevenson, Symeon of Durham's History, p. 150. Kapelle thought that, perhaps due to his failure to protect Northumberland against the Scots in 1079, Walcher's relations with Ligulf broke down, leading to the loss of Ligulf's support and then to hostility.Kapelle, Norman Conquest of the North, p. 139. On 14 May 1080 a party of Northumbrian natives attacked that bishop-earl and his household at Gateshead, across the river from the future site of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, having arrived to hold discussions.Kapelle, Norman Conquest of the North, p. 140. The discussions were fruitless and Walcher, who was protected with 100 knights, retired to the church there. The Northumbrians set the church on fire, after Leobwin refused to surrender himself.Stevenson, Symeon of Durham's History, p. 152. Walcher was forced out and stabbed with swords.Kapelle, Norman Conquest of the North, p. 140; Stevenson, Symeon of Durham's History, p. 152. Leobwin was burned to death. De primo Saxonum adventu says that the leader was Eadulf, son of Gospatric; the Historia Regum also names, Eadulf cognomento Rus as the killer, but claims he was a grandson of Gospatric through another Uhtred.Stevenson, Symeon of Durham's History, p. 143. The Libellus de exordio says that killer was a man named Waltheof, though this Waltheof may have been Eadulf's brother.Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. 214-‚Äî5, n. 99. According to the Historia Regum Eadulf was killed soon after the death of Walcher, slain by a woman. His body was buried in the church at Jedburgh (now Scottish Borders), until Prior Turgot of Durham Cathedral had it removed a few years later. Eadulf may have had a brother named DolfinSharpe, Norman Rule, n. 80, p. 35. in addition to a brother named Waltheof.According to De Primo Saxonum Adventu Waltheof was the name of a brother of his; see Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, p. 214, n. 99.

Romero films Dawn of the Dead, Knightriders, and Day of the Dead. Recruited by his good friend and Carnegie-Mellon University classmate Tom Savini, Stavrakis assisted with stunts and special makeup effects on several seminal 1980s horror productions, including the original Friday the 13th, in which he portrayed \\"The Prowler\\" (as the unidentified killer was initially referred to in Victor Miller's screenplay). Romero frequently joked that Stavrakis should be included in the Guinness Book of World Records for having appeared as the most zombies in his Dead series (5 in Dawn and 6 in Day).Romero, audio commentary track, Dawn of the Dead CAV laserdisc (Elite Entertainment, 1996). Post-college gigs in New York City included numerous off-Broadway plays and commercial jobs, including the first human incarnation of the Captain Morgan character for a rum advertisement and Battlestar Galactica's Lucifer character for an automobile commercial. Offered the opportunity to portray villain Jason Voorhees in Friday the 13th Part 2, Stavrakis turned down the role as his friend Savini had declined to create the film's makeup effects. He instead took an opportunity to create special makeup effects for He Knows You're Alone, an early thriller by Armand Mastroianni (and incidentally Tom Hanks's first feature film), with whom Stavrakis would work again on the 2006 cinematic adaptation of The Celestine Prophecy. Despite this early emphasis on makeup, Stavrakis eventually gravitated almost exclusively toward stunt work, serving as stunt coordinator on Day of the Dead and the Romero-scripted Creepshow 2 (1987), while his acting work during this period included a brief stint on As the World Turns as Stavros, a Greek interpreter. A tournament fencer and seasoned equestrian, Stavrakis is a founding member of the Hanlon-Lees Action Theater, an American entertainment company which pioneered the art of theatrical jousting. He also performed for several years with the Big Apple Circus during the mid-1990s as a variety of characters (including \\"Captain Coney,\\" a Coney Island-inspired superhero), and remains a member of BAC's Clown Care unit, providing entertainment and encouragement to children in hospital. His more recent film work includes appearances in Martin Campbell's The Mask of Zorro, Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (in a \\"Tortuga Island\\" sequence which was edited from the first film but utilized in the sequel) and Michael Mann's 2006 Miami Vice redux, as well as wrangling duties on pictures such as Jackass Number Two and the Seth Green road-trip comedy Sex Drive. In 2010, Stavrakis returned to his roots, appearing as a featured zombie in the pilot episode of the AMC Network series The Walking Dead. As the \\"living dead\\" subgenre has increased in popularity over the years, Taso now makes occasional appearances at horror-themed conventions around the world. In 2018, his brother Christian sculpted and installed a bronze bust of George Romero in the Monroeville Mall, the first public monument to Romero's work and career.

Career He began his engineering career in Glasgow, before moving to London in 1871, where he trained under James Abernethy. There, he gained experience on a number of projects, including the Alexandra dock works at Newport. In 1885, he took the post of assistant to the chief engineer of the South Devon and Cornwall Railway, where he worked on the construction of Plymouth railway station and the widening of the Newton ‚ÄìTorquay railway line. He joined the staff of the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1887 but set up his own practice shortly after, working under contract to the GWR on a number of projects, as well as a number of harbour works in Plymouth and Torquay. In 1892, he was appointed Chief Engineer to the Great Western Railway, just after the line had completed its conversion from broad gauge to standard gauge. He was tasked with replacing a number of Isembard Kingdom Brunel's large timber viaducts in Cornwall with new bridges of steel and stone. Inglis served in the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, an unpaid volunteer unit of the Volunteer Force which provided technical advice to the British Army. He was appointed a Major in that corps on 24 June 1893, by which time he was also a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). He was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel of the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps on 1 April 1908 on the date that it transferred from the disbanded Volunteer Force to the newly raised Territorial Force. One of Inglis's most visible works today is the Chalfont Viaduct on the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway, which now straddles the M25 motorway Among his major works were the construction of Fishguard Harbour (establishing a steamboat link with the Midland Great Western Railway and Great Southern and Western Railway at ); the construction of the Badminton railway line in South Wales; and the construction of the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway (now known as the Chiltern Main Line) between and . Honours and death Inglis was elected president of the ICE for the November 1908 to November 1910 session.. During his time as president he saw the start of construction of their new headquarters at One Great George Street. Inglis ceremoniously laid the foundation stone for the building in 1910 after placing beneath it copies of the institution's Royal Charter and the Telford, Watt and Stephenson medals awarded by the institution.. He was knighted by King George V at St James's Palace on 23 February 1911 by which point he was the General Manager of the Great Western Railway. Inglis died on 19 December that year and is buried at Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Cemetery, Hanwell in London.

O'Sullivan (January 31, 1928 ‚Äì March 28, 1971) was an Irish- American loanshark and longtime enforcer for Donald Killeen, the head of the Irish mob in South Boston, Massachusetts. O'Sullivan also acted as a mentor to a young James J. Bulger, who grew up to become the leader of Boston's Winter Hill Gang. Biography O'Sullivan was born in South Boston. He moved to the Savin Hill section of Dorchester with his wife, Mary, with whom he had six children. He worked for the state Massachusetts Department of Public Works until he was injured on the job in 1970 working on an MBTA tunnel at South Bay, Boston in South Cove. He had also previously worked as a bartender in South Boston. His wife Mary worked at Girl's Town (Girls Town of Somerville) on Morrissey Boulevard. She later told reporters, \\"Bill was a kind father. He wasn't strict with the children. He like young people, however, he was against... long hair... he didn't think it looked right.\\" They lived in a home at 300 Savin Hill Avenue. After her husband was murdered Mary professed not to have any knowledge on why her husband was shot to death, practically on the front steps of their home. She stated to the press that she was convinced that her husband's murder was not \\"one of those gangland slayings\\". She would later say that William was a \\"quiet man\\", a \\"fine husband\\" and a \\"wonderful father, and that he (wasn't) the type of person that you would associate with gangsters.\\"O'Donnell, Richard, \\"Dorchester Killing Mystifies Widow\\", The Boston Globe, March 29, 1971 Contrary to statements made by his wife, FBI documents report that O'Sullivan had a reputation as a \\"tough guy\\" and a prosperous loanshark because he was a close associate of Stephen Flemmi and Frank Salemme. After Salemme and Flemmi fled Boston as fugitives from murder convictions, rival mobster Donald Killeen wanted O'Sullivan to align himself with Ilario Zannino and himself. However, Killeen had begun having problems with the Mullen Gang, a group of burglars and stick up men led by Paul McGonagle and Patrick Nee. The Mullen-Killeen war In February 1971, Buddy Roache, a close associate of McGonagle told Whitey Bulger and O'Sullivan that he was going to murder Donald Killeen, and if they interfered, he would kill them. A violent argument followed, Roache drew his weapon and O'Sullivan shot him. Roache was hospitalized but survived the near fatal gunshot wound. Following the shooting, both Bulger, O'Sullivan, and neighborhood boss Donald Killeen expected retribution for the attack on a ranking member of the rival Mullen Gang. This fear proved well-founded and the rivalry between the Mullens and Killeens exploded into a gangland war. According to longtime Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks, Bulger's murder of Paul McGonagle's brother led directly to the Mullen Gang's assassination of his mentor. According to Weeks, > One day while the gang war was still going on, Jimmy was driving down > Seventh Street in South Boston when he saw Paulie driving toward him. Jimmy > pulled up beside him, window to window, nose to nose, and called his name. > As Paulie looked over, Jimmy shot him right between the eyes. Only at that > moment, just as he pulled the trigger, Jimmy realized it wasn't Paulie. It > was Donald, the most likable of the McGonagle brothers, the only one who > wasn't involved in anything. Jimmy drove straight to Billy O'Sullivan's > house on Savin Hill Avenue and told Billy O, who was at the stove cooking, > 'I shot the wrong one. I shot Donald.' Billy looked up from the stove and > said, 'Don't worry about it. He wasn't healthy anyway. He smoked. He would > have gotten lung cancer. How do you want your pork chops?'.Kevin Weeks, > Brutal: My Life in Whitey Bulger's Irish Mob, HarperCollins, 2006, pg. 171 Murder victim According to the memoirs of Mullen leader Patrick Nee, Paul McGonagle was thoroughly livid over the murder of his brother and, believing that O'Sullivan was responsible, received permission to kill him. On March 28, 1971, after having dinner with his wife at Jimmy's Harborside Restaurant, O'Sullivan dropped his wife off at their home and told her that he had an errand to do and that he would be back in an hour. Shortly after midnight, Mary noticed that his car was parked in the driveway in front of their house at the bottom of their driveway, it was surrounded by a group of neighbors. She went out to see what her neighbors were looking at and she saw her husband's bullet riddled body. She at first did not recognize his body but made positive identification from the suit that he wore. O'Sullivan had been shot by several gunmen numerous times as he sat behind the wheel of his car and was hanging half out of the car with the driver's door open. According to Weeks, > Billy O'Sullivan's death might not have happened if he had listened to > Jimmy. Billy O had been with Jimmy against the Mullens and had shot Buddy > Roache during the gang war. Buddy, whose brother Mickey later became > Boston's police commissioner, ended up crippled and in a wheelchair. In > March 1971, not long after he shot the wrong McGonagle, Jimmy went to New > York to pick up guns. Before he left, he told Billy to be careful while he > was gone and not to drink. But that night, Billy hung around with Kevin > O'Neil down at the Transit Cafe and ended up drunk. Kevin offered him a ride > home, but Billy refused the offer. Heading home, He was chased by a couple > of men with the Mullens gang who caught up with him when he tripped over a > manhole cover about 200 yards from his house and fell down. While he was > lying there, the pursuers shot him to death. If Kevin O'Neil had ended up > driving Billy O'Sullivan home that night, he probably would have been > killed, too.Weeks, Brutal, pg. 173 Aftermath In June 1972, Donald Killeen was murdered by Jimmy Mantville, another enforcer for the Mullen Gang. In the aftermath, the leadership of the Killeen crew devolved on Bulger. However, Bulger and the other Killeen loyalists fled Boston after the murder of their boss. Instead of murdering them as some Mullen gangsters wished, Mullen leader Patrick Nee arranged for the dispute to be mediated by Winter Hill Gang boss Howie Winter and Joseph Russo of the Patriarca crime family. After a sit-down in Boston's South End, the Mullen and Killeen gangs joined forces with Howie Winter as overall boss.

In Brazil it was released with the title Wrong Turn 2. In Mexico it was released with the title Wrong Turn 3.  Plot  The film begins with a couple (Sarah and James) held captive and tortured in a dark dungeon. After Sarah frees herself from her binding, James tells her to run and gets killed. Sarah runs away from a disfigured man in a black trench coat with a double blade sickle (Deacon). When Sarah reaches the edge of a cliff, with nowhere to run, she jumps off and dies as she hits the ground. The following scene shows another couple‚ÄîSheryl (Brianna Brown) and Mike (Josh Randall)‚Äîgoing on a hiking trip for the week. The park ranger advises them to take Willow Creek or Donner trail, but when they're hesitating which way to go, they meet a seemingly friendly woman (Ida) who recommends them Timber Falls trail, and they decide to take that path. The two face a trio of unfriendly hunters while making love, who try to sell them their self- made alcohol and warn them to be careful about what they do in the woods. Disturbed by the hunters' attitude, Mike is about to pull out his gun, but Sheryl stops him from shooting them and the two leave. Sheryl convinces Mike to throw away his bullets. After meeting another park ranger (Clyde) and hiking down the trail, the couple sets up the camp. They have sex and go to sleep, unaware of a shadowy figure outside the tent that spies on them during the night. In the morning, Sheryl goes to a lake to bathe. She then gets kidnapped by an unknown person. Mike wakes up and finds that Sheryl is missing. He tries to find her and sees two of the hunters he and Sheryl encountered the previous day. He sees one of them holding one of Sheryl's towels. Believing that they kidnapped her, he hits one of them on the head with a log, causing the other to run away. After taking the hunter's shotgun, Mike demands that the hunter tell him where Sheryl is. He tells Mike he hasn't seen her since the day before. He tries to attack Mike with a knife, but Mike knocks him out by hitting him with the stock of the shotgun. Mike leaves the hunter there and continues his search for Sheryl. He then gets his foot caught in a bear trap. Ida appears as he slowly faints. As he wakes up, he finds himself in Ida's cabin. She tends his wound and assures Mike that she will contact the sheriff via the radio upstairs. Mike becomes suspicious because Ida calls him by his real name Michael. He claims that no one calls him Michael except for his dead grandmother and accuses Ida of stealing his wallet and I.D. She denies this, but he begins demanding that she let him use the radio. Ida and Mike engage in a fight, ending with the wounded Mike knocking out Ida. Mike rushes upstairs to use the radio, only to find it out of order. While hobbling around, he accidentally discovers a secret basement and goes down. Mike spots a shelf full of prematurely born fetuses in glass jars. He finds Sheryl tied up and gagged in a room and frees her, but at that very moment, they confront Deacon - Ida's brother. Mike tells Sheryl to run away as Deacon attacks him. Sheryl runs away with Deacon hot on her heels and bumps into Clyde on the way. She frantically asks him for help, but as she realizes that he's in cahoots with Deacon, Clyde knocks her unconscious and recaptures her. Sheryl wakes up to find herself strapped to a chair. The family turns out to be a group of insane religious fanatics. After Ida describes having seen the couple having sex in their tent a few days previously, she and Clyde tell the couple that the punishment for their sins is to have a child for Ida and Clyde, due to Ida not being able to have a baby. Mike and Sheryl are forced to marry, and over the course of 3 days, Ida and Clyde force them to attempt to have a child and brutally torture them if they don't. Both Mike and Sheryl refuse to comply with their demand, for they know that if they have a baby, Ida and Clyde will kill them anyway. During the couple's confinement, Deacon tries to rape Sheryl several times but fails due to Ida and Clyde's dissuasion. After a few days pass, Ida grows impatient and threatens Mike to torture Sheryl in front of him if he doesn't obey them. Out of a sudden, Sheryl begins laughing hysterically. She tells Ida that she has already been two months pregnant with Mike before they went on the hiking trip and that the child was conceived in sin, leaving both Ida and Clyde in shock. Their evil plan now turns fruitless. Ida drops the scalpel she is going to mutilate Sheryl with, and Clyde consoles her. Meanwhile, two of the hunters Mike and Sheryl met days before hear about the missing couple and presume that something strange is going on at Ida and Clyde's home (they saw Mike and Sheryl's car still in the parking lot, but when one of them talked to Clyde about it, he asserted that they already left). The two go there on the third night that Mike and Sheryl have been captured to investigate. They make a noise while breaking the glass on the front door. Ida and Clyde hear the glass tinkle and go to check it out, leaving Mike and Sheryl alone in the room. Mike tries to grab the scalpel and successfully cuts the rope holding his hands. One hunter finds a secret door to the cabin's basement but is killed by Clyde, only after Mike manages to yell for help. The other goes down to the basement and gets shot dead by Ida. Ida and Clyde bury the dead hunters' bodies. Ida suggests aborting Sheryl's baby when Clyde suggests killing Mike and Sheryl and finding another couple. When Clyde gets back to the basement, Mike quickly stabs his neck and shoots Clyde in the head with his shotgun. Ida then gets to the basement and is shocked to find Clyde's corpse lying in a pool of blood. Mike attacks her, but she fights back and stabs his legs repeatedly. Sheryl knocks her unconscious with a shovel. The couple exits the basement and prepares to leave the cabin. Mike tells Sheryl to run for help. She finds Clyde's walkie-talkie and tries to call the Rangers Post, but she faces Deacon again in the cabin and accidentally breaks the walkie-talkie during the chase. After a long struggle, she sets him on fire by throwing moonshine on him along with a lit match, burning him alive. She picks up his sickle and finds Mike in the cabin. Ida emerges from the basement and stabs Mike with a knife, Sheryl quickly decapitates her with Deacon's sickle. She patches up Mike's wound and calls the Rangers Post with her cell phone, finally ending their sufferings. One year has passed since Mike and Sheryl survived their ordeal. The couple put their baby to bed and leave the room. As the movie ends, the camera fades over to the window where Deacon's double blade sickle suddenly appears.

Morales was the founder of the Mexican American Opportunity Foundation (MAOF), the largest Hispanic nonprofit in the nation.Becerra, Hector, \\"Activist founded U.S.'s largest Latino human services group\\", Los Angeles Times Sep 29, 2008. He spent his life fighting segregation and prejudice in the United States. His abilities to work with corporate and political leaders opened the doors and jobs for thousands of Latinos in the U.S. His personal relationship with President Lyndon Johnson allowed MOAF to win significant civil rights victories for Latinos.Morales, Dionicio, Dionicio Morales: A Life in Two Cultures, Pi√±ata Books, Dec 1997 His civil rights activism earned him recognition as ‚Äúan urban Cesar Chavez‚Äù and social entrepreneur. He worked tirelessly inspiring several new generation of Mexican American business and political leaders as he pursued his vision of a U.S.A. where all Latinos have equal opportunities in education and the workplace.  Biography  Morales was the first of his parents‚Äô 11 children who came of age during the Great Depression era in the then rural community of Moorpark, California. His parents were Mexican immigrants who had settled in Southern California to work in the agricultural fields. Competition for work during the Great Depression worsened anti-Mexican sentiments and Los Angeles County set up a fund to finance their expulsion. Those who remained suffered numerous hardships including deplorable living conditions, lack of adequate health care, which contributed to widespread tuberculosis. Morales nearly died of the disease just as seven of his siblings did. In school, Mexican and Mexican American children were separated from Anglo students and prohibited from speaking in Spanish with the threat of corporal punishment. These injustices led him to dedicate his life‚Äôs work to bettering the plight of Mexican Americans. Morales studied at Santa Barbara State Teacher‚Äôs College and became a compliance officer with the Bracero program, which brought Mexican workers to the U.S. to labor in the fields and factories depleted of workers by the war effort. It was here he first met Cesar Chavez. He went on to work as a probation officer for Mexican American youth and later a labor organizer in East Los Angeles. His years in East L.A. helped lay the groundwork for the formation of what would become the Mexican American Opportunity Foundation in 1963. In 1978, Morales became the first Mexican American, through MOAF, to be the recipient of a million-dollar government contract. Morales was awarded an Ohtli Award in 1997 from the Mexican government for his work in activism and MAOF. In 1998, Morales wrote his autobiography, Dionicio Morales: A Life in Two Cultures, where he described his family's migration from Mexico and their fight against poverty and discrimination in the United States. Morales died in Beverly Hospital in Montebello, California.  Mexican American Opportunity Foundation  MAOF has become the largest social services provider in the United States, serving more than 100,000 Californians and providing childcare for an estimated 8,000 children each day. The first job training contract came when Morales decided to call the president for help with funding. He was able to get through to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, who helped him meet the Secretary of Labor who granted MOAF a $37,000 training contract. Mr. Morales developed relationships with corporate giants, including Kraft Foods, Rockwell International, McDonnell Douglas, and Lockheed Martin that would lead to many jobs for Mexican Americans. MAOF still works in job training but 80 percent of its $57 million budget goes to child care programs that enable parents to work. Morales had retired from working with the foundation eight years before his death.

It is on the northern edge of the town of Grantham and on the Grantham to Lincoln A607 road, between the East Coast Main Line and the River Witham. The village is part of the civil parish of Belton and Manthorpe. History Before the 19th century, Manthorpe parish was agricultural and known as Little Gonerby-cum-Manthorpe. The Grantham to Lincoln road followed what is now Low Road, across the river behind Swallow‚Äôs Mill, through Belton Park and along the old route to the Roman town of Ancaster on the Ermine Street Roman Road. In 1810 the Brownlow family, owners of Belton Park and House just north of Manthorpe, built a new road from Grantham to Belton. In the 1840s and 1850s new houses, a church and school were built, and established properties renovated. The Church of England parish church of St John the Evangelist was designed by architect George Gordon Place of Nottingham and built in 1847‚Äì48. It was built as an estate church by the Brownlow family to provide for Belton Estate workers. In 1885 Kelly's Directory described Manthorpe as \\"a small and pleasant village\\". It was an ecclesiastical district, established in 1849 from the civil parish of Grantham. The village formed a township with Little Gonerby, was within the Grantham parliamentary borough, the rural deanery of North Grantham, and the archdeaconry and Diocese of Lincoln. Manthorpe‚Äôs church of St John the Evangelist was consecrated by the Bishop of Lincoln in 1848. The church is in early Decorated style, consisting of a chancel, nave, south porch, and vestry, and a tower with 2 bells, and with a spire high. The church, graveyard and parsonage sites were provided by Earl Brownlow, who also paid for the construction of the parsonage. The earl‚Äôs brother, Richard Cust, St John‚Äôs rector in 1885, erected the church at his own expense. Bequests from both brothers provided the living, which was a vicarage united with that of Londonthorpe. The parish register dates from 1849, with earlier records for Manthorpe included in Grantham registers.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull 1885, p. 571 Kelly‚Äôs describes the area as being skirted on the north by a formation of blue lias, and on the south by oolite, with land being of sand with a gravel subsoil. Chief crops grown were wheat, barley, oats and turnips, in a township area of that included Little Gonerby. In 1881 the ecclesiastical district contained a population of 243, and the Manthorpe-cum-Little Gonerby township, 3,567. An infant school for 50 children, with an average attendance of 30, was erected in 1865 through the financial support of Earl Brownlow. Township occupations included four farmers, two cowkeepers, a grazier, a wheelwright, three shopkeepers, and a miller at Manthorpe Mill, a watermill. In the early 20th century, houses began to be connected to electricity, with others supplied by a village pump or their own well. Eventually the Brownlow estate connected water and electricity to all households. By the late 1940s there were approximately a dozen houses west of Manthorpe Road, with the village still separated from Grantham. During the 1950s and 1960s houses were built west of Manthorpe Road and on the side of the River Witham. In the 1960s Grantham became conjoined to the village after Manthorpe housing estate was built on the north side of the town. When the 6th Lord Brownlow died in 1978 further land became available, and most cottages in Manthorpe village were sold. Community The nearest schools are situated on the Manthorpe estate in Grantham. These are The Priory Ruskin Academy, (formerly the Central Technology & Sports College), a mixed-sex secondary school on Rushcliffe Road, and Cliffedale Primary School on Northcliffe Road. The ecclesiastical parish is the benefice of Grantham Manthorpe, of the Deanery of Grantham. The 2013 incumbent is the Revd Canon Chris Andrews. The nearest shop is a convenience store on the corner of Sandcliffe Road and Rushcliffe Road, on the Manthorpe estate. Closest supermarkets are in Grantham.

By 1685, Giuseppe's workmanship had surpassed their father's, and when Andrea died in 1698 Giuseppe took over the shop. = Competition with Stradivari = A promising young violin maker named Antonio Stradivari was emerging, who in 1680 moved his workshop to the Piazza San Domenico, just a few metres away from the Casa Guarneri. Because of this increasing local competition, by 1683, Pietro had moved to Mantua, leaving Giuseppe to work in their father's shop. = Marriage and family = In 1690, Giuseppe married young Barbara Franchi, a parishioner of Sant‚Äô Agata, who then joined the Guarneri family in the house on Piazza San Domenico. In the meantime the health of Andrea seems to have further declined, thereby increasing his son's responsibility in the running of the family workshop. Giuseppe's elder son Pietro (Pietro II, 1695; 1762), left Cremona and established his own workshop in Venice about 1718, becoming known as Pietro di Venezia (\\"Peter of Venice\\"). Giuseppe's younger son, Bartolomeo Giuseppe ( 1698; 1744), became the most celebrated member of the dynasty. Because he used the letters I.H.S. on his labels, he became known as ‚Äòdel Ges√π‚Äô. He was one of the greatest makers ever; many feel his instruments are better than Stradivari's. Del Ges√π violins are renowned for their rich, powerful tone, and have been favoured by virtuosos from Paganini to Pinchas Zukerman. = War of the Spanish Succession = Cremona was by this time experiencing one of its most troubled periods. Involved in the War of Spanish Succession, the city was besieged by Austrian troops and was finally captured in the Battle of Cremona in 1702, when Prince Eugenio of Savoy, the commander of the Habsburg troops, stormed the city. Through all of this, Giuseppe continued his work. = Illness = Giuseppe's health had declined so much that in the parish of year 1730 he is absent because he was hospitalized. He was back at home by the time of the 1731, but was now incapable of working. His son, Bartolomeo, who did not make violins for years, came back to Guarneri Workshop to help his father. Giuseppe continued to assist Bartolomeo, particularly in the carving of the heads between year 1731 and 1739. = Death = In the Easter of year 1740, Giuseppe ‚Äòfilius Andreae‚Äô was no longer present in the family house. It is likely that he died in early 1740 in one of the city's seven hospitals. It is nevertheless strange that he was not buried in the family tomb in San Domenico ‚Äì perhaps he died out of town or of a contagious disease.  Instruments making  Amati style = Continued working in the Amatis√© style of his father, Andrea, but latterly was influenced by his close neighbour Antonio Stradivari. = Guarnerius style = Around 1705, Giuseppe introduced a new violin model with a wider upper bout and a narrower middle bout that is distinctively squarish in shape. He also changed the soundholes from the short and sinuous Amati style to a longer and more rigid design. Giuseppe's designs was influenced by Gasparo da Salo of Brescian School, and incorporated some of the stylistic refinements of his older brother (Peter of Mantua); the outline tended to be more narrow waisted, the f-holes were lower and more elegant, and he used a richer, more Brescian varnish. This pursuit of excellence continued into the next generation. and perfected by Giuseppe's son, Bartolomeo Giuseppe. Giuseppe was once thought to be the teacher of Carlo Bergonzi, however it is now known that Bergonzi was a pupil of Vincenzo Rugeri.

Biography Reed was born in Highland Falls, New York to a Russian-Jewish family. Orphaned at an early age and reunited with his family two years later in New York City, Reed started working Vaudeville Houses as a chewing gum peddler. In 1919, a performer carried him onto the stage and this began a career that would last until 1998. Reed was a performer and a singer on WOR Radio in New York City in the 1930s. He appeared in numerous Broadway and Off-Broadway Productions from 1940‚Äì72, including several Gilbert and Sullivan works and long runs with Up in Central Park, Guys & Dolls, The Music Man, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, Here's Love and Promises, Promises. In 1956, his comedic talents came forward as a foil for Sid Caesar in Caesar's Hour. In 1958, he would appear on Sergeant Bilko with future Car 54, Where Are You? star Joe E. Ross. In 1961, Reed was cast in the Nat Hiken situation comedy Car 54, Where Are You? as the beleaguered Captain Paul Block of the 53rd Precinct in the Bronx. Reed, a master of timing, was the perfect foil for the antics of the wacky police officers of the 53rd. His trademark on the show was the slow burn in which his reaction would go from restrained anger until he reached his boiling point and would explode. The show ended its run on September 8, 1963 after 60 episodes. During the 1964‚Äì1965 season, Reed portrayed business executive Damon Burkhardt in The Cara Williams Show. He continued to work on Broadway and in sitcoms through the 1960s, appearing in various episodes of Bewitched, The Donna Reed Show, Beverly Hillbillies and I Dream of Jeannie. In 1965, he appeared with former Car 54, Where Are You? co-stars Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in an episode of The Munsters. In later years, Reed was a staple in television commercials until the 1990s. A book about his life and career titled You Grew Up, written by Paul Reed Jr. was released in 2010 and is available through Bear Manor Media. He died on April 2, 2007 (age 97) in Greenwich, Connecticut, USA.

Prior to that, he was elected as the fifth Kaptein of the then-autonomous Baster community at Rehoboth, succeeding Dr. Ben Africa in 1979 after winning a court challenge to the disputed election of 1976. Both before and after independence, Diergaardt founded several local political parties, among them the Federal Convention of Namibia. He represented this party as a member of the Constituent Assembly of Namibia, convened to draft the constitution for the new nation of Namibia. Diergaardt is known for his criticism of black-majority rule in the early years of independent Namibia. Believing that minority group rights were not sufficiently protected, he led a legal suit to establish autonomy for Rehoboth Gebied, the historic district of Baster settlement, which had a kind of autonomy under German colonial and South African rule. The nation's Supreme Court ruled that Rehoboth had no special status in the newly independent Namibia. Before his death, Diergaardt filed an official complaint in 1998 with the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which ruled in 2000. It declined to rule on one issue, but concluded that Namibia was exercising linguistic discrimination against the Afrikaans-speaking Basters. Early life and political activities Diergaardt was born into a Baster family in Rehoboth, then part of South-West Africa, on 16 September 1927.Chronology for Basters in Namibia, UNCHR, 2004 He became a professional car mechanic but also worked as a farmer, businessman, and politician throughout his life. In 1947 Diergaardt started his political career by joining the Rehoboth Burgervereniging (). He later founded the Rehoboth Tax Payers Association (1959), the Rehoboth Volksparty (, 1968), and the Rehoboth Liberation Party (1975). This was during the period following World War I when South African administered the territory, although the United Nations General Assembly had retracted its mandate in 1966. After that, SWAPO initiated an independence movement in 1966, conducting a guerrilla war against South Africa. Diergaardt was elected as a member of the Rehoboth Advisory Council in 1959. After SWAPO began organizing an independence movement, Diergaardt served as Chairman of the National Convention in 1969. He participated in talks at the Turnhalle Conference (1975‚Äì1977) in opposition to Kaptein Ben Africa, who officially led the Baster delegation at the conference. Ascension to Kaptein In 1976 South Africa granted the Basters a form of autonomy for the area around Rehoboth under the Self-Government Act, No. 56, in an effort to hold their loyalty. As part of its implementation of a Baster Homeland, South Africa supported an election for the Kaptein (Tribal chief) of Rehoboth. Incumbent Dr. Ben Africa won narrowly, and Diergaardt came second. Diergaardt challenged the election results in court; when he won in 1979, he was confirmed as the fifth Baster Kaptein in history. He served as leader of the Baster Homeland (or bantustan) from 1979 until independence in 1990. Believing that alliances with native tribes was important, Diergaardt promoted new housing for the Nama people and was the first local authority in Namibia to desegregate the school system. He also tried to build alliances at the national level to enable the Basters to have a voice in their future, but the major effort there was on ridding the country of South Africa control.JOSEPH LELYVELD, Special to the New York Times, \\"MIXED-RACE NAMIBIAN GROUP SEEKS POLITICAL ALLIES\\", New York Times, 30 July 1981, accessed 9 April 2016 Diergaardt represented the Rehoboth Free Democratic Party (RFP) and had a seat in the Transitional Government of National Unity (TGNU). This was directly linked to the South African apartheid state, which allowed it to operate some governmental powers from June 1985 to February 1989. Diergaardt was the second chairman of the TGNU.\\"Hans Diergaardt\\", Namibia, World Statesmen Prior to Namibian gaining independence, Diergaardt was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Namibia, which wrote the country's constitution. After independence, in 1990 Diergaardt threatened armed secession from Namibia if the government tried to redistribute the land of Rehoboth (as had been discussed prior to independence.) He believed that minority group rights were not sufficiently protected under the Namibian Constitution.\\" 'Rehoboth Journal;' Fearful Namibian Tribe Raises Flag of Freedom\\", The New York Times, April 4, 1990 He mounted a court challenge seeking to establish autonomy for the Basters based on their prior history in the country; the Supreme Court ruled they had no special status. Before his death, Diergaardt filed an official complaint on behalf of the Basters with the United Nations Human Rights Committee. In Diergaardt v. Namibia (2000), the committee found evidence of linguistic discrimination against the Basters by the Namibian government, which refused to use the Afrikaans language in dealing with this community.

It is located within the City of Clarence which is a constituent local government area within Greater Hobart. Along with Clarence High School, and Rose Bay High School, Geilston Bay High School is one of three high schools within Clarence. The school emblem is the Eucalyptus risdonii, a local eucalyptus variety with bluish-silver leaves that is found only within the City of Clarence. History Construction of the school began in 1971 on the site of the old Lindisfarne Golf Course. The first phase of construction was completed on 1 July 1971. Geilston Bay High School was opened on 9 February 1972 as the then Municipality of Clarence was enjoying a boom in residential expansion. The opening of the Hobart Bridge (1943), and later the Tasman Bridge (1964) saw a dramatic expansion of residential areas within Clarence. However, prior to the Tasman Bridge disaster in 1975, there were few facilities located on the eastern shore of the Derwent River. The severing of the bridge made local authorities realise the need for localised services in areas of commerce, health care and education. Geiston Bay High School is the most recently opened high school within the City of Clarence, after Warrane High (1957), Clarence High (1959), and Rose Bay High (1961). In 2007 Geilston Bay High School celebrated its 35th anniversary. Geilston Bay High School closed on 2013, with the last day being 19 December. Low enrolment numbers was cited as the reason.

It was remade for the Xbox 360 in 2012, with ports of the new version to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013, which was also ported back to Microsoft Windows. The player controls a spelunker who explores a series of caves while collecting treasure, saving damsels, fighting enemies, and dodging traps. The caves are procedurally generated, making each run through of the game unique. Spelunky is one of the first games that borrowed concepts from roguelikes and combined them with real-time side-scrolling platformer elements. Due to its popularity, it was the influence for many later \\"rogue-lite\\" games. The first public release was on December 21, 2008. The source code of the Windows version was released on December 25, 2009. An enhanced version for Xbox Live Arcade was released on July 4, 2012. The enhanced version was later released for Windows PCs and PlayStation 3 in August 2013, and for PlayStation 4 on October 7, 2014. A Chrome OS version of the original game was made as well, titled Spelunky HTML5.Spelunky HTML5 - Chrome Web Store A sequel, Spelunky 2, was released for PlayStation 4 on September 15, 2020. Gameplay The player controls an unnamed adventurer, known as the spelunker. The aim of the game is to explore tunnels, gathering as much treasure as possible while avoiding traps and enemies. The spelunker can whip or jump on enemies to defeat them, pick up items that can be thrown to either attack enemies or set off traps, and use a limited supply of bombs and ropes to navigate the caves. Levels are randomly generated and grouped into four increasingly difficult \\"areas\\", each with a distinctive set of items, enemies, terrain types and special features. Later areas contain more valuable treasures, secret locations, and items. If the player loses all their hearts or runs into an instant-kill trap, they will have to start from the beginning. Enemies include animals like bats, snakes and spiders of varying sizes, other characters, and monsters like yeti, man- eating plants and ghosts. The player can collect many items, mainly gold and jewels which add to the player's score, but also useful objects including bombs, guns, climbing gear and archaeological artifacts. Some of the latter have supernatural abilities, including kapalas, hedjets, crystal skulls and golden ankhs, though many of these special items can only be gained through secret methods, like combining other items together. Some items may be purchased or stolen from shops scattered about the caves, though the shopkeepers become powerful enemies if you steal from them. The player can also encounter damsels in distress trapped in the caves, who can be picked up and carried to an exit. Successfully doing so returns health to the player. It's possible to unlock the damsel as a playable character; gameplay is identical, except that the player encounters spelunkers to rescue. Another unlockable character is the \\"Tunnel Man\\", who possesses a mattock instead of a whip. The Xbox Live Arcade, as well as the PlayStation Network versions of the game feature local multiplayer (co-op and deathmatch) for up to four players. There are 9 different characters to play as. The original Spelunky also includes a level editor, in which players can create their own non-random levels to share with others. Development remake from 2012 (right). Spelunky was created by Derek Yu and released as freeware for Microsoft Windows on December 21, 2008. The source code of the 2008 Windows version was published under a software license permitting noncommercial distribution and modification on December 25, 2009.Spelunkyworld.com Based on this source code the game community created a community patch which added support for Mac OS X. Since the game source code became available community members have created many modified versions, or mods, of the original game.Spelunky SD Mod Adds Co- Op To Free Original Version by Graham Smith on Rock, Paper, Shotgun (July 7th, 2014) Most of these are available via the forums on the website for Derek Yu's video game company, Mossmouth, where a list is maintained of finished mods. An enhanced remake version for Xbox Live Arcade was released on July 4, 2012. The enhanced edition was also released on PC on August 8, 2013 and for PlayStation 3 on August 27 and 28, 2013. =Influences= Spelunky draws from La-Mulana, Rick Dangerous, and Spelunker for its visual styling, character design, gameplay elements and general mechanics. Essentially a dungeon crawl, it also adds elements from the roguelike genre, including randomly generated levels, a lack of save points, frequent and easy death, and discovery mechanics. It draws equally from the 2D platformer genre, including real-time interactions with enemies. According to Yu, the Super Mario series of video games was one of the game's biggest inspirations, especially in \\"feel and physics.\\" Reception IGN gave the XBLA version a score of 9.0 and an Editor's Choice award, calling it \\"a superb 2D platformer that's as easy to hate as it is to love.\\" GamesRadar gave the game 5/5, praising its gameplay and constant sense of discovery. GameTrailers gave the game a score of 8.3, praising its design but criticising some control quirks and throwaway multiplayer. 1UP.com gave the game an A ranking, saying \\"it offers the same immediate, pick-up-and-play fun of Geometry Wars, but demands much more than the simple reflexive reactions of your lizard brain.\\" PC Gamer UK chose the remake of Spelunky as its 2013 game of the year. Eurogamer ranked Spelunky third on its Games of the Generation list. In 2015, Rock, Paper, Shotgun ranked the original Spelunky 1st on its The 50 Best Free Games On PC list. A difficult challenge run of Spelunky HD, known as an \\"eggplant run\\", was reported on by various video game news websites. In 2019, Spelunky was ranked 36th on The Guardian newspaper's The 50 Best Video Games of the 21st Century list. The spelunker, the main character of Spelunky, is one of several indie game characters who can be unlocked and played in Super Meat Boy. Referred to as \\"Spelunky\\" in Super Meat Boy, the character has the special power of explosive jumps (referencing the bombs he carries in the original game), and he is exclusive to the Xbox Live Arcade version. He also makes an appearance in Runner2 as a DLC character. Spelunky was a commercial success, selling over one million units by 2016. The Steam launch was noted to be particularly successful by Derek Yu, with 61,408 units sold within the first week, and 577,185 units throughout the game's lifetime.

The station is currently silent to relocate its transmitter site. History At 990 kHz, WJCF (then WERK) first signed on in 1965 from a six-tower array south of Muncie. The original WERK \\"990 WERK\\" featured a Top 40 format, built by the Poorman family, who operated an ad agency. WERK was the first commercial station in east-central Indiana with a Top 40 format, and for many years competed with WHUT (1470 AM) in Anderson, WGOM (860 AM) in Marion, and with WHON (930 AM) in Richmond. The station was then sold in 1981 to the Galesburg Printing and Publishing Company after Robert Poorman's death. The station was sold in 1991 from James Beatty to American Hometown Radio Corporation alongside WOKZ (104.9 FM). By that time, the station was airing a contemporary Christian music format. American Hometown sold the pair in 1997 to Dream Weaver Broadcasting. In 1999, Dream Weaver donated the license to Electronic Applications Radio Service, a nonprofit organization, but did not include the transmitter facility. As a result, EARS reactivated the station by means of an STA (special temporary authority) granted by the FCC, returning to the air as WLHN with 67 watts. The call sign was changed to WRFM in March 2003. Greenfield-based Indiana Community Radio Corporation (ICRC), which operated WJCF-FM 88.1 in Morristown, acquired the station from Electronic Applications Radio Service. After the acquisition by ICRC, the station broadcast a news and information format as \\"True Talk For Indiana\\" then flipped to oldies in 2009 utilizing Scott Shannon's True Oldies Channel, which was a commercial 24/7 satellite music service offered by Citadel Media. WRFM also previously broadcast via FM translator W230AR 93.9; that translator was moved to Columbus, Ohio, in 2017. Today, the station broadcasts a simulcast of WNAP-FM.

Rhythmicity in arterial smooth muscle. J Physiol (Lond ). 2005; 566: 645-656, Aalkaer C, Nilsson H. Vasomotion: cellular background for the oscillator and for the synchronization of smooth muscle cells. Br J Pharmacol. 2005; 144: 605-616. While vasomotion was first observed by Thomas Wharton Jones in 1852, the complete mechanisms responsible for its generation and its physiological importance remain to be elucidated, however several hypotheses have been put forth.Aalkaer C, Nilsson H. Vasomotion: cellular background for the oscillator and for the synchronization of smooth muscle cells. Br J Pharmacol. 2005; 144: 605-616. Mechanism Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration exhibits periodic oscillations in vascular smooth muscle cells. This is thought to result from Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, due to inositol triphosphate and ryanodine-sensitive channel activation. This activation has been shown to result in either Ca2+ \\"sparks\\", highly localized calcium increases, or \\"waves\\", global Ca2+ increase that propagates the length of the cell.Jaggar JH, Porter VA, Lederer WJ, Nelson MT. Calcium sparks in smooth muscle. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C235-256. To allow vasomotion to occur, synchronization must occur between the individual oscillations, resulting in global calcium synchronization and vessel tone oscillation.Nilsson H, Aalkjaer C. Vasomotion: mechanisms and physiological importance. Molecular Interventions. 2003; 3: 79-89. Gap junctions are thought to play a large role in this synchronization, as application of gap junction blockers has been shown to abolish vasomotion, indicating a critical role.Haddock RE, Hirst GDS, Hill CE. Voltage independence of vasomotion in isolated irideal arterioles of the rat. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 219-229. Due to regional variations in gap junction distribution and coupling (homocellular vs. heterocellular) several hypotheses have been suggested to account for vasomotion occurrence. The \\"classic\\" mechanism of vasomotion generation is thought to be the voltage-dependent coupled model. In this model, high gap junction coupling is present between the vascular smooth muscle cells, the endothelial cells and the endothelial to vascular smooth muscle cells. An initial depolarizing current leads to the opening of the voltage-dependent calcium channels, ultimately resulting in synchronization of individual calcium levels. When patch clamp recordings are conducted, depolarization occurs in the endothlial layer at the same time as the underlying vascular smooth muscle. The cause of the initial depolarizing current, however, remains to be determined. Mathematical modeling has pointed to the existence of 2-4 independent non-linear oscillating systems interacting to produce vasomotion.Parthimos D, Haddock RE, Hill CE, Griffith TM. Dynamics of A Three- Variable Nonlinear Model of Vasomotion: Comparison of Theory and Experiment. Biophys J. 2007; 93: 1534-1556. It is possible that in order for vasomotion to be generated, these systems must pass a depolarizing threshold. Physiological role Several possible hypotheses have been advanced to explain vasomotion. Increased flow is one possibility; mathematical modeling has shown a vessel with an oscillating diameter to conduct more flow than a vessel with a static diameter.Meyer C, de Vries G, Davidge ST, Mayes DC. Reassessing the Mathematical Modeling of the Contribution of Vasomotion to Vascular Resistance. J Appl Physiol. 2002; 92: 888-889. Vasomotion could also be a mechanism of increasing the reactivity of a blood vessel by avoiding the \\"latch state\\", a low ATP cycling state of prolonged force generation common in vascular smooth muscle. Finally, vasomotion has been shown to be altered in a variety of pathological situations, with vessels from both hypertensive and diabetic patients displaying altered flow patterns as compared to normotensive vessels.Gratton RJ, Gandley RE, McCarthy JF, Michaluk WK, Slinker BK, McLaughlin MK.

She was considered one of the most beautiful Chinese women ever. Life Legends record that during the last years of the Xia dynasty, two dragons entered the palace of the king. When they left, the Xia king ordered that the dragon‚Äôs saliva left inside the palace be kept in a wooden box. During the time of King Li of Zhou, he tried to open the box despite a taboo against such an act, since it had not been opened for more than a thousand years. The saliva accidentally spilled and transformed into a black lizard. The lizard crawled in front of a seven-year-old slave girl. Eight years later she became pregnant while still a virgin, and gave birth to a girl. The mother abandoned the baby, who was later adopted by a couple who escaped to the state of Bao and raised her to adulthood. She was later presented by the ruler of Bao to King You. In 779 BC, Bao Si entered the palace and came into King You‚Äôs favour. She bore him a son named Bofu.Revised Chinese Dictionary, Ministry of Education, Taiwan King You deposed Queen Shen (Áî≥Âêé) and Crown Prince Yijiu. He made Bao Si the new queen and Bofu the new crown prince. Bao Si was of a melancholy disposition so King You offered a thousand ounces of gold to anyone who could make her laugh. Someone at the court suggested lighting the warning beacons usually used to summon armies from the surrounding vassal states in times of danger. The nobles duly arrived at the court only to find themselves laughed at by Bao Si. Chapter 1 Even after King You had impressed Bao Si, he continued to abuse his use of warning beacons and so lost the trust of the nobles. States of the Western Zhou Dynasty Queen Shen‚Äôs father was upset by the deposition of his daughter and grandson Yijiu and mounted an attack on King You‚Äôs palace in conjunction with Quanrong nomads. King You called for the nobles with the beacons but none came as they no longer trusted him. In the end, King You and Bofu were killed and Bao Si was captured at Xi (Êà≤/Êàè).

Her date of death is unknown. The story of Bao Si and King You of Zhou is amongst the most well-known and iconic of love stories from Ancient China, and serves not only as a demonstration of extreme love but also as a cautionary tale of how one beauty can topple a nation. Through the few references available, it can be presumed that Bao Si was born in 792 BC (three years younger than King You) and died in 771 BC (assuming that her death happened by suicide shortly after the Quanrong attack).

There is no carburetted version of the engine, which would have been designated O-580 and therefore the base model is the IO-580. This engine family competes with the Continental IO-550 series which are also six-cylinder engines with similar power output and weight. Design and development The IO-580 had originally been developed at the behest of Cessna, who were looking for a modern engine to power their Cessna 206 Stationair. Development was slow, and the aircraft was delayed to wait for the engine. When production began, Cessna found problems with the cylinders, and instead of further delaying the introduction, they moved the 206 to the older and less powerful 260 hp Lycoming IO-540. Lycoming eventually addressed all of the problems, and the engine found some use in various aerobatic aircraft, but no serious production was undertaken. The IO-580 family of engines covers a range from . The engine has a fuel injection system which meters fuel in proportion to the induction airflow through air-bled nozzles at the individual cylinder intake ports. The engine has a displacement of and produces a maximum of in its B1A version. The cylinders have air-cooled heads cast from aluminum-alloy with a fully machined combustion chamber.

Delaney- O'Dubhshlaine (c. 1937 in South Boston ‚Äì August 4, 1964 in Port of Boston) was an Irish-American gangster and member of the McLaughlin Gang who was a friend and associate of Harold Hannon, a contract killer who had murdered boxer Tommy Sullivan in 1957. Biography Delaney was born to second-generation Irish-Americans from Leinster, Ireland. He was known as a friend and criminal associate. He detested the old-fashioned and feminine- sounding name \\"Wilfred\\" among his friend and preferred to be called \\"Willy.\\" By the age of twenty-seven Wilfred had an arrest record for rape and armed robbery. While his friend Harold Hannon was the initial target of the murder, Delaney was unfortunate to be in the company of his friend. Casualties of the McLean-McLaughlin war that claimed dozens in the 1960s, Delaney and Hannon were strangled to death and their corpses were tossed into the Boston Harbor, where they were discovered by longshoremen the following day. Gang leader Buddy McLean used a female friend as a ruse to set up Wilfred. She enticed both Delaney and Hannon to come back to her South Boston apartment for sex. When Wilfred and Harold saw McLean with a few of his men in the girl's apartment they tried to escape but were quickly apprehended by the mobsters. The medical examiner later discovered during the autopsies of both men that the killers had used a butane blow torch and badly burned Hannon's genitals, allegedly to get information from him. After getting the information he wanted he strangled them both and dumped them in Boston Harbor. Delaney did not meet the same slow, agonizing, drawn-out death as Harold Hannon. Wilfred was made to swallow large amounts of sedatives and was strangled after he drifted into unconsciousness.WIlfred J. Delaney. Encyclopedia of Boston Mobsters. Accessed September 1, 2012. The method used to murder Delaney mimics the murder methods of Mullen Gang mob associate Buddy Leonard, ordered by James J. Bulger and bartender Kenneth Conrad, murdered by Louis Litif.

He was the son of Sir Roger Townshend (died 1590) and Jane Stanhope. He was also a soldier and Member of Parliament. He was killed in a duel with Sir Matthew Browne in August 1603. Family John Townshend was the eldest son of Sir Roger Townshend (died 1590) and his second wife, Jane Stanhope (c.1547‚Äì1618), the daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope (d.1552) of Shelford, Nottinghamshire, by his wife, Anne Rawson, daughter of Nicholas Rawson of Aveley, Essex.; . After the death of Sir Roger Townshend (died 1590), his widow, Jane, married, as his second wife, Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley. She died at her house in the Barbican on 3 January 1618, leaving a will dated 20 July 1617 which was proved by her grandson, Sir Roger Townshend, 1st Baronet, on 10 March 1618.. Career Townshend inherited considerable estates in Norfolk from his father, coming to be recognised as one of the leading members of the county gentry. Educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, he was a member of the Parliaments of 1593, 1597‚Äì1598 and 1601, representing Castle Rising, Norfolk and Orford respectively. He served in the English Army in the Netherlands under Sir Francis Vere in 1592, and in 1596 took part in the Earl of Essex's expedition against Cadiz, being knighted as a result. Tempers rose high in Norfolk at the time of Essex's Rebellion, and Townshend adhered strongly to the faction led by Sir Edward Coke and opposed to Essex. His feud with Sir Christopher Heydon, one of Essex's supporters, ended in 1600 with Heydon challenging Townshend to a duel, but before they could fight both men were summoned before the Privy Council, and were only released when Coke offered to go bail for Townshend's good behaviour. Townshend was said to have been a 'very distinguished member' of King James's first Parliament.. However while the Parliament was in session, Townshend fought a duel on horseback on Hounslow Heath on 1 August 1603 with a kinsman, Sir Matthew Browne of West Betchworth in Dorking, Surrey. Browne was killed on the spot, while Townshend was mortally wounded and died the following day.; ; . Townshend was succeeded by his eldest son, Roger, who was then underage. His wardship was purchased by his grandmother, Jane, then the wife of Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley.. Roger Townshend was created a baronet in 1617, and was the ancestor of the Marquesses Townshend. Marriage and issue Townshend married Anne Bacon (1573‚Äì1622), eldest of the three daughters of Sir Nathaniel Bacon (c.1546‚Äì1622) by his first wife, Anne Gresham (d.1594), the illegitimate daughter of Sir Thomas Gresham.. Sir Nathaniel Bacon was a half brother of Sir Francis Bacon. Through this marriage the Townshends inherited the former Bacon estate of Stiffkey. There were three children of the marriage: *Sir Roger Townshend, 1st Baronet. *Stanhope Townshend (1597?‚Äì1620?), *Anne Townshend, who married John Spelman.

The other subunit is E2. This protein is a type 1 transmembrane protein with a highly glycosylated N-terminal ectodomain and a C-terminal hydrophobic anchor. After being synthesized the E1 glycoproteins associates with the E2 glycoprotein as a noncovalent heterodimer.Lavie, M.; Goffard, A.; Dubuisson, J. In Chapter 4 HCV Glycoproteins: Assembly of a Functional E1-E2 heterodimer; Norfolk: UK, 2006; . Structure  The E1 glycoprotein residues 192-383 in the genotype 1a H77 strain. After translation the E1 C-terminal transmembrane domains (TMDs) forms a hairpin of antiparallel a-helices. E1 is then cleaved by signal peptide peptidase at the endoplasmic reticulum and E1 is then made into a single long straight a-helix. What is known of the structure is from a crystal structure made in 2014. This crystal structure shows that it has two a-helixes and 3 B-sheets for both monomers; two disulfide bridges stabilize these two monomers. This means that E1 is more compact then its E2 counterpart. It has been shown that E1 can fold with a small amount of E2 protein present. In addition to this it was shown that E1 oxidation preceded E2 maturation. This means that E1 has a chaperone-like role for E2. Despite these finds there are many things still unknown about the structure of E1. The E1 protein is anchored to the membrane. Most of the time E1 remains in its unfolded conformation.  Function  The E1 protein helps the virus attach to the membrane of the targeted cell. In other envelope virus the E1 protein has a similar role in helping the virus get into the cell. As a heterodimer with E2 it has been discovered that it is essential for HCV entry.Lavie, M.; Goffard, A.; Dubuisson, J. In Chapter 4 HCV Glycoproteins: Assembly of a Functional E1-E2 heterodimer; Norfolk: UK, 2006; . When the heterodimer is formed the hepatitis C virus is then able to bind to the receptor of the cell. As a heterodimer the E1 protein alone with the E2 protein worked together to enter the cell. Also cleavage at the core-E1 junction is a prerequisite for SPP-catalyzed cleavage. This helps the virus relocate to the surface of lipid droplets. Once the virus gets to the surface of the lipid droplets it recruits the virus no-structural proteins and replication complex. The SP-catalyzed cleavage at the core-E1 junction is required for the formation of infectious particles and for the release of any HCV particles. Also E1 has no function with budding at the ER membrane. It also had no effect on the intracellular formation of capsid-containing particles. Instead when E1 was not allowed to form this tended to facilitate the budding process. Possible Vaccine It has been shown that by blocking E1 we can prevent the formation of the envelope protein. There have been a number of studies trying to find the structure of E1. The hope for these vaccines is that they will be able to block the entry of Hepatitis C if they can block the formation of E1. If the virus cannot make the envelope protein then it will be unable to get into the host cells. The types of vaccines that would be used are synthetic peptide vaccines.

(revd Matthew HCG). \\"Watson, John Selby (bap. 1804, d. 1884)\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press; 2004) was a British classical translator and murderer. He was sentenced to death in 1872 for killing his wife, but a public outcry led to his sentence being reduced to life imprisonment. The case is notable for Watson's use of a plea of insanity as his defence, bringing \\"the insanity defense into perhaps its greatest prominence since M'Naghten.\\"Wiener MJ. (1999) Judges v. Jurors: Courtroom Tensions in Murder Trials and the Law of Criminal Responsibility in Nineteenth-Century England. Law and History Review 17(3): 467 Career Watson was born at Crayford.Wilson, Colin; Pitan, Patricia. (1962). Encyclopedia of Murder. G.P. Putnam's Sons. p. 546 He was educated by an uncle and graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in 1838.Wilson and Pitman, p. 546. He was ordained Deacon by the Bishop of Ely in 1839 and married Anne Armstrong in January 1845 at St. Marks, Dublin.Wilson and Pitman, p.546. Due to his poverty Watson had been engaged to Anne for quite a number of years before they could marry. He moved to London in 1844 where he became the headmaster of Stockwell Grammar School.Stockwell Park Because of falling pupil numbers he was laid off in 1870. But during his long career as headmaster, Watson had made a reputation for himself as a scholar and translator, publishing translations of the classics for Bohn's Classical Library that subsequently became volumes in the popular Everyman's Library series. He also wrote biographies, religious books, and a volume Reasoning Power in Animals. Still with all his learning and activities he made a very small income. When the Board of the Stockwell School fired him, they refused to give him any pension. Crime A few weeks after finishing his four-volume History of the Papacy to the Reformation, on 8 October 1871 Watson was found unconscious by his servant, Ellen Pyne, having taken prussic acid. Two notes were found: one addressed to Pyne contained her wages. The other was to his doctor. It said \\"I have killed my wife in a fit of rage to which she provoked me\\". His wife's body was found in a bedroom, having been battered to death with the butt of his pistol two days earlier. Trial Watson recovered and stood trial at the Old Bailey in January 1872. Despite a history of arguing with his wife, Watson did not argue provocation. Instead, he pleaded insanity, as his counsel put it: \\"an antecedent improbability in the deed which would lead everyone in the first instance to seek an explanation in insanity.\\" The judge, Mr Justice Byles, opposed this excuse strongly in his summing-up. After deliberating for an hour and a half, the jury found him guilty of murder but with a recommendation that mercy be shown because of his age and previous character. Byles however sentenced him to death. After the trial many affidavits from doctors were presented testifying to Watson's insanity at the time of the murder. Byles then changed his mind and told the Home Secretary that the medical evidence presented at the trial suggested that \\"this is not a case in which the sentence should be carried out.\\" After more investigation the Home Office decided that some \\"imprecise mental unsoundness\\" had been present and commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Due to no obvious signs of madness, however, he was not sent to Broadmoor Hospital, instead he served his time in Parkhurst prison where he died twelve years later, aged 80, on 6 July 1884. His death was due to falling out of his hammock at the prison.Simpson, Cannibalism and the Common Law, p.96. In the words of Martin J. Wiener, \\"the incongruity of the offense and the lack of any lesser defense pushed the system to a controversial finding of \\"temporary\\" insanity to prevent the unedifying spectacle of the hanging of a clergyman of the Church of England. In a sense, in Watson's case, provocation (by his wife, under the stress of his forced retirement) had been reconceived as temporary insanity.\\" The crime became the basis for the 1984 speculative historical book Watson's Apology by Beryl Bainbridge. =Original works= *The Life of George Fox, the Founder of the QuakersList of works *Biographies of John Wilkes and William Cobbett *The Reasoning Power in Animals, 1867 =Translations= *Conspiracy of Catiline and the Jugurthine War by Sallust *On the Nature of Things by Lucretius Carus *Historia Philippicae et Totius Mundi Origines et Terrae Situs by Justin, 1853 *Cicero on Oratory and Orators by Marcus Tullius Cicero, 1855 *Institutes of Oratory by Quintilian, 1856 ReferencesExternal links  * Simpson, A.

It has around 13,000 inhabitants and covers about 60% of the area of the island. History The municipality was formed on 1 January 2009 by the merger of the former municipalities Rantum and Sylt-Ost with the town of Westerland. The debate on this move had started in 2003 when a similar merger happened on Fehmarn. However, local rivalries and desire for independence prevented progress for a time. It took the foundation of a citizens' movement B√ºrger f√ºr Sylt als Einheit to advance the plan. In separate referendums in 2008, Westerland (by a large majority) and Sylt-Ost (narrowly) agreed to the merger in May 2008. Rantum followed, but List, Kampen, Wenningstedt-Braderup and H√∂rnum remained aloof. In September 2008 the merger contract was signed. Although Westerland used to have the status of Stadt (town), the new municipality so far refrained from applying for this status. One reason is that the Ortsteile do not want to advertise their tourism services as simple suburbs (Stadtteile).

It appears to be a dimeric form without trans-membrane helices. Structure NS5A is derived from a large polyprotein that is translated from the HCV genome, and undergoes post-translation processing by nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) viral protease. Despite no inherent enzymatic activity being attributed to NS5A, its function is mediated through interaction with other nonstructural (NS) viral and cellular proteins. NS5A has two phosphorylated forms: p56 and p58, which differ in the electrophoretic mobility. p56 is basally phosphorylated by host cellular protein kinase at the center and near the C terminus, whereas p58 is a form of hyperphorylated NS5A at the center of the serine-rich region. It has been predicted that the N-terminal 30 aa of NS5A form an amphipathic Œ±-helix with a highly preserved feature, which is essential to modulate the association between NS5A and ER membrane. The IFN- sensitivity determining region (ISDR) at the C-terminal of NS5A has been reported to perform strong trans-activating activities, suggesting that NS5A likely functions as a transcriptional activator. NS5A has three structurally different domains: Domain I was demonstrated to be an alternative dimeric structure by crystallography, while domain II and III remained unfolded. Furthermore, the conformational flexibility of NS5A plays an important role in multiple HCV infection stages. It is also possible that NS5A is a critical component during HCV replication and subcellular localization, which may shed light on the poorly understood HCV life cycle. Additionally, NS5A has been shown to modulate the polymerase activity of NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Intriguingly, NS5A may be a RNA binding protein because it is able to bind to the 3‚ÄôUTR of the plus and minus HCV RNA strands. Moreover, NS5A is a key mediator in regulating host cell function and activity upon HCV infection. Therefore, NS5A has been extensively studied in HCV research also due to its capability to regulate the interferon (IFN) response of the host cells. Because NS5A exerts functionally essential effects in regulation of viral replication, assembly and egress, it has been considered a potential drug target for antiviral therapeutic intervention. Indeed, small molecule drugs efficiently targeting NS5A displayed a much higher potency in controlling HCV infection than other drugs. Therefore, NS5A related researches would have important implications in single molecule drug design and pegIFN- free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination therapies. As a drug target Many antiviral drugs target NS5A, e.g. to treat hepatitis C, sometimes described as NS5A inhibitors: Intragenic complementation Multiple copies of a polypeptide encoded by a gene often can form an aggregate referred to as a multimer. When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different mutant alleles of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone. When a mixed multimer displays increased functionality relative to the unmixed multimers, the phenomenon is referred to as intragenic complementation. NS5A protein is a multimer, a dimer in this case, and intragenic complementation of replication-defective NS5A alleles has been demonstrated by Fridell et al.Fridell RA, Valera L, Qiu D, Kirk MJ, Wang C, Gao M. Intragenic complementation of hepatitis C virus NS5A RNA replication- defective alleles. J Virol. 2013;87(4):2320-2329. doi:10.1128/JVI.02861-12 On the bases of pairwise complementation tests between different NS5A mutant alleles, they identified three complementation groups that were considered to define three distinct and genetically separable functions of NS5A in RNA replication.

Back in the National 2 the club enjoyed a successful season winning the Coupe Falcou for a second time and reaching the league final against Aspet XIII in a repeat of the previous Federal Division final, this time though they lost out 9-16 but were promoted to the 2nd tier for the first time. After a couple of seasons in the Elite Two Championship Gifi reached the league final in 2007 and against all odds won 16-14 against Racing Club Albi XIII. The club decided not to take up the offer if promotion to the top flight and this led to the team slowly breaking up. By 2012 the club were back in the 4th tier after suffering successive relegations. In 2014 a decision was made to leave their base in Bias and move to nearby Pujol.

It is notable for changing its name from a \\"school\\" to \\"A place of learning\\" in January 2009, with staff at Watercliffe Meadow claiming that this was because, \\"the word school may have negative connotations for pupils and parents.\\" The change was attacked for being too politically correct. Name change The criticised \\"change\\" of name from \\"school\\" to \\"A place for learning\\" was reported with varying degrees of inaccuracy as being an early decision when the new school was formed as a merge between three former primary schools: Shirecliffe, Busk Meadow and Watermead infant and junior schools, at a cost of ¬£4.7 million. Linda Kingdon, the head teacher said: \\"This is Watercliffe Meadow, a place for learning. One reason was many of the parents of the children here had very negative connotations of school. Instead, we want this to be a place for family learning, where anyone can come. We were able to start from scratch and create a new type of learning experience. There are no whistles or bells or locked doors. We wanted to deinstitutionalise the place and bring the school closer to real life.\\" The name on the sign was criticised, with people arguing that the change is too politically correct. Whilst this was exaggerated by dint of the fact that the tabloid media reported, inaccurately, that the word school had been banned (and in fact it merely didn't appear on the sign and continues to be used daily by staff, parents and pupils) the slogan itself opened the school up to ridicule. There was also press emphasis on the name \\"change\\", when in fact the subtitle to the School (Watercliffe Meadow) has been fixed since before the material completion or opening of the premises. Further to this misrepresentation, Sheffield Star contacted Marie Clair from Plain English Campaign who said: \\"It's laughable. Do they think by changing the name they will change the environment? We all know what the building is. There is this whole political correctness agenda. Using unfamiliar words instead of a simple one, like 'school', will get in the way of children's ability to learn.\\" Richard Caborn, the Member of Parliament for Sheffield Central commented that: \\"I'm always open to new ideas, but the reality is education is about preparing young people to live in the real world. I just don't think the case has been made to drop the word school to a place of learning. I don't know why they have done it.\\" Andrew Sangar, Sheffield city council's cabinet member for children's services and lifelong learning said that, \\"It's a school, we consider it a school and that's how we refer to it. How a school chooses to manage and refer to itself is a matter for the board of governors and the community it serves and we're relaxed about that.\\" References Category:Primary schools in Sheffield Category:Community schools in Sheffield ","title":"Watercliffe Meadow Community Primary School"},{"id":"20937609","text":"Swan galaxias is a name for two species of fish in Australia: *Galaxias fontanus, found in Tasmania *Galaxiella munda, found in southwest Australia ","title":"Swan galaxias"},{"id":"20937617","text":"HCV genome Nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) is a viral protein found in the hepatitis C virus. It is also produced by influenza viruses, and is alternatively known as the nuclear export protein (NEP).  Role in Hepatitis C virus  NS2 is one of seven nonstructural proteins in HCV, with each being encoded near the carboxy-terminal end of the positive-strand RNA virus. Once translated it is 217 amino acids in length and has a molecular weight of approximately 23 kDa. NS2 possesses a hydrophobic amino-terminal subdomain as well as a carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain, with the amino-terminal subdomain containing up to three putative transmembrane segments. NS2 proteins are post-translationally processed by the HPV-encoded cysteine protease NS2-3, which is formed by residues 94-217 of NS2 itself as well as residues 1-181 of nonstructural protein 3 (NS3). The NS2-3 autoprotease acts by making a single cleavage between the junction of NS2 and NS3. While the NS2 protein itself is unnecessary for replication of the HCV virus (as demonstrated by HPV replicons that were able to self-replicate after removal of the entire C to NS2 coding region), this cleavage of the NS2/NS3 junction is critical. Despite being dispensable in the replication of HCV, NS2 does play an important role in the production of new HCV particles. Multiple studies have shown that the full NS2 RNA sequence (and thus protein) is necessary for viral assembly. While it is somewhat uncertain as to why this is, one group demonstrated that viral particle production in HPV chimeras was most efficient when the chimeric fusions were conducted directly downstream of the first transmembrane domain of NS2. This discovery implies that the first transmembrane segment of NS2‚Äôs hydrophobic amino-terminal subdomain physically interacts with upstream structural components of the HPV sequence. Its structure is indeed highly conserved between HCV genotypes, with a flexible helix in residues 3-11 and an alpha helix in residues 12-21. A subsequent implication is that the carboxy- terminal domain ‚Äì which is also home to the proteasome region of NS2 ‚Äì are not important in particle production. This theory is corroborated by evidence that mutations in the NS2 protease region do not effect virus production. Additional research shows that SN2 is involved in HPV particle production. It has been determined that the substitution of one highly conserved NS2 residue, Ser-168, with either Alanine or Glycine results in impaired virus production but not impaired RNA replication. Impairment or elimination of particle production was determined via the number of infectious HPV particles released by transfected cells post-genome mutation. This result further demonstrates that NS2 is critical for viral assembly but not viral RNA replication (which is, however, influenced by cleavage of the NS2/NS3 junction as discussed previously). Furthermore, that same study theorized that the mutation of Ser-168 affects viral assembly in terms of release: assembled NS2 mutants were unable to exit the cell (and were thus not infectious), suggesting that NS2‚Äôs importance lies in the very late stages of assembly.  Role in the inhibition of apoptosis  NS2 is an inhibitor of liver cell apoptosis. The viral protein interacts with CIDE-B, a liver-specific pro-apoptotic protein whose carboxy- terminal killing domain induces cell death activity. The binding specificity is strong enough to counteract CIDE-B‚Äôs induced release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, as demonstrated by single deletion mutations that result in a loss of interference. This activity has been interpreted as an important strategy for the survival of HCV in host cells.

Later, Wijewardene bought a larger area of land elsewhere in Colombo, and built 'Lake House' building, which then became home to the offices of the Dinamina, along with several other newspapers that Wijewardene began, including the Sri Lankan English daily, the Daily News. Despite the plethora of other newspapers based in the building, it became known as the 'Dinamina Kantoruva' in Sinhala, meaning 'Dinamina Centre'. The price of a copy was three cents in Ceylonese rupees at the time it first began circulation. The newspaper is written as a broadsheet, with photographs printed both in color and black and white.

Early life Sayyid Zulfikar Ali Khan Bahadur was born at Rampur on 11 March 1933, the second son of Nawab Sir Sayyid Raza Ali Khan Bahadur. He was commissioned into the Indian Army. He retired from the army as a Major, then worked as a tea planter in Assam for several years.

In a major turn of events, the Congress lost control of India for the first time in independent India in the Indian general election, (23/3/1977 ‚Äì 22/8/1979). The election came after the end of The Emergency that Prime Minister Gandhi had imposed in 1975; it effectively ended democracy, suppressed the opposition, and took control of the media with authoritarian measures. The opposition called for a restoration of democracy and Indians saw the election results as a repudiation of the Emergency.M.R.

Civil liberties were suspended during the national emergency from 25 June 1975 to 21 March 1977 and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi assumed vast powers. Gandhi had become extremely unpopular for her decision and paid for it during the elections. Gandhi, on 23 January, called fresh elections for March and released all political prisoners. Four Opposition parties, the Organisation Congress, the Jan Sangh, the Bharatiya Lok Dal and the Socialist Party, decided to fight the elections as a single party, called the Janata Party. The Janata Party reminded voters of excesses and human rights violations during the Emergency, like compulsory sterilisation and imprisonment of political leaders. The Janata campaign said the elections would decide whether India would have \\"democracy or dictatorship.\\" The Congress tried to woo voters by speaking about the need for a strong government but the tide was against it. The Indian National Congress lost all its seats in Uttar Pradesh and the Nawab too had to leave his seat.

The result was a loss for the Indian National Congress and Rajiv Gandhi, because all the opposition parties formed together a minority government under V. P. Singh and the National Front. The National Front was able to secure the first minority government, since 1947 Independence, with the help of the Left Parties and Bharatiya Janata Party. Even though Rajiv Gandhi had won the last election by a landslide, this election saw him trying to fight off scandals that had marred his administration.

He was born and died in Basel. Family His father Hans Jakob, a wine grower, had migrated from Russikon in the Zurich region and worked in the Basel hospital, eventually becoming hospital supervisor. His mother's maiden name was Magdalena Betzler. In 1611 Johann Rudolf married Anna Maria Falkner.  Career  Wettstein himself attended the ‚ÄúSchule auf Burg,‚Äù the present-day secondary school located at the M√ºnsterplatz in Basel. Afterwards he concluded a chancellery apprenticeship in Yverdon and Geneva. The Historical Lexicon of Switzerland records that Wettstein's marriage was not a happy one. Apparently for that reason he moved to Venice in 1616. In 1620, after his return to Basel, Wettstein was elected to city council. His career in the public service progressed with increasingly responsible positions. In 1635 he became senior guild master, and was elected mayor of Basel in 1645.  Swiss independence  Wettstein participated in the negotiations for the Peace of Westphalia in 1646/47 as a delegate for the Old Swiss Confederacy, without having been invited, and initially also without accreditation by the Confederacy. After long, hard, and skilful mediation he achieved official recognition of Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1648.  Later life, death and posthumous recognition  During the 1653 Peasants‚Äô War in the Basel region Wettstein was responsible for the public execution of seven peasant leaders. Wettstein died in Basel in 1666. He is generally acknowledged as one of the most competent politicians of his era, but also as a prominent exponent of the absolutist tendencies within the Swiss Confederacy. Associated with Switzerland's independence, Wettstein's name first became prominent around 1750, and reached its zenith during World War II, when the country's sovereignty was challenged once more. A bridge built across the Rhine in Basel in 1881 bears his name. In addition, a local square, street and boulevard have been named after Wettstein.

He was responsible for a number of important buildings which still stand today in Namibia, particularly in Windhoek, including the national assembly building, the Tintenpalast. Life Christ Church, Windhoek Tintenpalast, Windhoek Gottlieb Redecker was the eldest son of a family of seven children born to Johann Wilhelm Redecker and his wife Maria Kardin Amalie n√©e Gronermeyer. The father (1836‚Äì1911) came in 1867 from Bielefeld in Westphalia to Otjimbingwe in the former South West Africa. Gottlieb was one of the first students of the famous Augustineum, which was later attended by the sons of the famous Herero chief Samuel Maharero. After his mother had died when he was 11, he was sent back to Germany accompanied by missionaries. After completing his secondary education, he studied engineering. On 25 January 1898, he married Joan Marie Elise Kornfeld, by whom he had a daughter, Anne Marie Ilse Klara Redecker. After a second stay in Germany, he returned to Otjimbingwe, at that time the de facto capital of German South West Africa, and was appointed director of engineering in 1901 by the Imperial Government, at which point he began his career as first architect of the country. Due to his long residence abroad he had lost the German citizenship he inherited from his father and was classified as a Damara by German administrators. He spoke both Damara and Herero fluently and knew the country and the people. Through his language skills and former school friends, he had access to the leading local personalities. As a distinguished architect Gottlieb Redecker was responsible for a large number of buildings in the country, especially the famous Christ Church and the Tintenpalast (\\"Ink Palace\\"). His third and best design for Christ Church, in a neo-Romanesque style, was finally approved by the government. He not only made the drawings, but also oversaw the management of the construction under adverse circumstances. The building was completed on 15 October 1910 after about three years of construction, and dedicated wity great festivity. After the First World War - which ended in South West Africa with the Khorab Peace - Gottlieb was released from internment in Kimberley, South Africa, and returned to Germany from South West Africa in 1921. He retired in 1931. He was killed on 21 January 1945 during an air raid, in which his house was bombed, on G√ºtersloh, where he was buried.

The commissioners took over from fourteen existing turnpike trusts, and were empowered to levy tolls to meet the costs of road maintenance. Creation The Metropolitan Trust was created by private act of Parliament (4 Geo IV c.142) following pressure from business interests in north London, who found that the numerous toll-gates throughout the area were interfering with the passage of goods and conduct of trade. The fourteen trusts consolidated were: *Kensington *Brentford *Isleworth *Uxbridge *Marylebone *Harrow *Kilburn *Highgate and Hampstead *City Road *Stamford Hill and Green Lanes *Old Street *Hackney *Lea Bridge *Camden Town The total length of roads was 129¬º miles, and Sir James McAdam was appointed \\"General Surveyor of the Metropolis Roads North of the Thames\\". Commissioners The commissioners initially consisted of the members of parliament for the City of London, City of Westminster, and County of Middlesex along with forty peers and gentlemen named in the 1826 Act. Any vacancies occurring after this were to be filled by co-option. Metropolitan Turnpikes Act 1829 In 1829 a further, public, act was passed which placed the commissioners on a statutory basis, and gave them increased powers. They were empowered to construct three new roads:Metropolitan Turnpikes Act 1829 (c.59) #From Stamford Hill to Camden Town (the present Seven Sisters Road/Camden Road) #A short realignment of the main Hertford Road at Enfield Highway (the former route becoming \\"Old Road\\") #A road from the Lea Bridge Road in Walthamstow to the main London - Epping Turnpike Road: the modern Woodford New Road. A number of roads in central London were declared highways and transferred from the care of the commissioners to the local parish authorities. The roads remaining under the trust were organised into sixteen districts, with different tolls applied, and the funds gathered being applied to the maintenance of the roads in the district: *First District: Roads in Westminster, Kensington, Chelsea, Fulham, Ealing and Hanwell, including The Great Western or Old Brentford Road from Knightsbridge to Brentford. *Second District: The remainder of the Great West road from Brentford to Bedfont along with other main roads in Isleworth, Hounslow, Teddington and Twickenham. *Third District: Comprised the Uxbridge Road west from Tyburn to the seventh mile stone, and Church Lane, Kensington. *Fourth District: Included the remainder of the Uxbridge Road, and the present Hanger Lane / Gunnersbury Avenue. *Fifth District: A projected road from the Uxbridge Road at Shepherd's Bush to Turnham Green on the Great Western Road. *Sixth District: The road from Paddington to Harrow-on-the-Hill. *Seventh District: The modern Maida Vale and Kilburn High Roads. *Eighth District: The Edgware Road (running from Kilburn in the Seventh District to Edgware). *Ninth District: The modern Euston Road with other main roads in St Pancras, Islington and Kentish Town. *Tenth District: The City Road *Eleventh District: The road from Shoreditch to Lower Edmonton *Twelfth District: The continuation of the road in the Eleventh District from Lower Edmonton to the Hertfordshire/Middlesex boundary at Cheshunt. *Thirteenth District: The Green Lanes Road from Newington Green to Enfield. *Fourteenth District: The Seven Sisters Road *Fifteenth District: main roads in Hackney and Shoreditch *Sixteenth District: Lea Bridge Road and the new road to Woodford. Competition from the railways In 1838 the trust gathered tolls to the value of ¬£83,497. By 1840 the amount had declined to ¬£67,475 as a direct result of the opening of railways in the capital. The commissioners were forced to look for economies, and in 1841 they announced that they would cease to light the roads, and offered the light fittings to the parish vestries along the roads free of charge. In some parts of the metropolis the vestries refused, or were unable, to take over the lighting. In spite of the declining finances, the commissioners were given more responsibilities: the New North Road from Highbury to Shoreditch was placed under their care in 1849, and in 1850 the roads of the Marylebone and Finchley Turnpike Trust.New North Road Act 1849 (c.lxvi)Marylebone and Finchley Turnpikes Extension Act 1850 (c.xxxii) Ending of the turnpikes in the Metropolis By the 1850s the unpopular tolls were under attack. A parliamentary Toll Reform Committee was formed, and in 1857 it issued a report. In it, it was pointed out the commission itself was unrepresentative, it contained four MPs from the City of London, which was untolled, and two from Westminster, which had only one gate. However the constituencies of Finsbury, Marylebone and Tower Hamlets, which were heavily-tolled, had no representation. The campaign eventually led to the enactment of the Metropolis Roads Amendment Act 1863 (c.78). From 1 July 1864 the tollgates were to be removed from most of the roads, with administration passing to the incorporated vestries and district boards established by the Metropolis Management Act 1855. The commissioners retained control of arterial roads outside the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works:Metropolis Roads Amemdment Act 1863 (c.78) *The \\"Great Western Road\\" from the Hammersmith boundary to Isleworth. *The \\"Uxbridge Road\\" from Hammersmith boundary to Uxbridge. *The \\"Harrow Road\\" from the Hampstead boundary to Harrow. *The \\"Kilburn Road\\" from the Hampstead boundary to Sparrows Herne in Hertfordshire *The \\"Green Lanes Road\\" outside the Metropolis *The \\"Seven Sisters Road\\" from the Islington boundary *The \\"Stamford Hill Road\\" from the Hackney boundary to Enfield *The \\"Lea Bridge Road\\" from the Hackney boundary to Snaresbrook. Abolition The commissioners went out of existence on 1 July 1872, when section 13 of the Annual Turnpike Acts Continuance Act 1871 (C.115) came into effect. The roads under the care of the trust passed to the various parish vestries on that date.

Yonow & Hayward (1991) treated the two names as synonyms and, acting as first revisers, gave precedence to kubaryana over nigerrima. Pola et al. (2008) agreed with the synonymy, but initially rejected Yonow & Hayward's nomenclatural act, arguing that nigerrima had page precedence over kubaryana. However, the ICZN Code does not contain such a thing as \\"page precedence\\", and Yonow & Hayward's (1991) action was valid ‚Äì and this position has been repeated by Yonow (2011).

Distribution This species occurs in the tropical Western Indo-Pacific.Seaslugforum.net Description This animal can reach a total length of more than 120 mm. It is a large dark-bodied nudibranch which may have green stripes running down the length of the body or have green raised spots. The margin of the foot and head is a vivid red- orange. The rhinophores and gills may be red or green. Nembrotha kubaryana is easily confused with a similar species, Nembrotha cristata although the latter has no red orange border on its foot.

The South end of the ground feature high fencing to block stray balls going into Park. There is a small car park. In 2018 thanks to the hard work of chairman William Huntley amongst others, floodlights were installed at Wern Mynach, which brought night games to Barmouth for the first time in the club's history.

Founded by brothers Lasantha Wickrematunge and Lal Wickrematunge, the newspaper is known for its outspoken and controversial news coverage. Iruresa was founded under the Irudina name. The Irudina name was registered by President's Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty. On the night of 16 October 2005 armed men entered the printing press of Leader Publications, threatened the manager with \\"dire consequences\\" if the newspapers continued to be printed and then set fire to bundles of newspapers. The attack came after The Sunday Leader had published an article which alleged that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa had misappropriated tsunami relief funds. The printing press of Leader Publications in Ratmalana was burnt down on 21 November 2007 by a group of armed masked men who entered the building, poured petrol on the printing machines and set fire to them. The attack came after The Morning Leader had been critical of the Asian Tribune's relationship with a government backed paramilitary group. Irudina journalist Dileesha Abeysundera was the target of a kidnapping attempt on 28 September 2009 when a group of unidentified men tried to force their way into her home in Borella. After Lasantha Wickrematunge's assassination in 2009 Ladduwahetty demanded Rs. 3 million from Lal Wickrematunge for use of the Irudina name. Lal Wickrematunge renamed the newspaper Iruresa. In September 2012 Asanga Seneviratne, an ally of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, bought a 72% stake in the Iruresa and its sister newspaper The Sunday Leader. Seneviratne is managing director of Asia Fort Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd and vice president of Sri Lanka Cricket. He is also president of Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union and controversially appointed President Rajapaksa's son Yoshitha Rajapaksa as captain of the Sri Lanka national rugby union team. The Sunday Leader had published a number of reports exposing Seneviratne's property developments and investment deals. After buying the Iruresa, Seneviratne bought the Irudina name from Ladduwahetty for Rs. 2 million. The Iruresa is to be renamed Irudina.

It is an important station in the Namibian rail network, and it is run by TransNamib. History The first railway line to reach Windhoek was the one from Swakopmund, built between 1897-1902 during Imperial Germany's colonial rule of German South West Africa. In 1914 this line was extended to Walvis Bay. The southern line from L√ºderitz (built 1906) was connected via Keetmanshoop to Windhoek in 1912. In 1930 the eastern line to Gobabis was built. Building The station was built in a Cape Dutch-style and is located on Bahnhof St. An additional northern wing was constructed by South African Railways in 1929 to match the existing style of the building. The station also houses the small Trans-Namib Transport Museum which outlines Namibian transport history, particularly that of the railway. Opened on July 1st 1993, the exhibition consists of a wide range of railway equipment, maps and related items which date back to German colonial times. Another part of the exhibition is dedicated to Namibian Airways history and Namibian Maritime history. You can also see the crockery and cutlery used in the dining cars of South African Railways in Namibia along with telecommunication and electrical equipment. http://www.namibweb.com/railmuseum.htm Across from the entrance stands the German locomotive Poor Ole Joe, one half of a South West African Zwillinge No 154A, the sole surviving specimen of this type of steam locomotive.

Death with Interruptions was published in 2005 in its original Portuguese, and the novel was translated into English by Margaret Jull Costa in 2008. The novel focuses on death, as both a phenomenon and as an anthropomorphized character. A key of the book is how society relates to death in both of these forms, and likewise, how death relates to the people she is meant to kill. Plot summary The book, set in an unnamed, landlocked country at a point in the unspecified past, opens with the end of death. Mysteriously, at the stroke of midnight on January 1, no one in the country experiences death any more. Initially, the people of this country celebrate their apparent victory over mankind's longtime foe. Though the traditional sources for guidance on things like life and death endeavor to discover why people have stopped dying, religious authorities, philosophers, and scholars alike can find no answers. The Catholic Church feels threatened by this new turn of events, as the end of death would call into question one of the fundamental foundations of their dogma: the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. On the other hand, common citizens generally enjoy their newfound immortality. However, this joy is short-lived ‚Äî it soon becomes apparent that the end of death presents unique demographic and financial challenges. The complete cessation of dying leads to a growing fear among healthcare workers that the system will collapse under its own weight: generations of incapacitated, but still living, people will populate care homes and hospitals for, presumably, all eternity. Funeral directors, on the other hand, fear the opposite problem: they will have no business, and will be forced to move to preparing animals for the afterlife. A means of finally killing people, and relieving families of the burden of their catatonic kin, is devised and implemented by an underground group known only as the maphia (the 'ph' is chosen to avoid any confusion with the more sinister Mafia). The incapacitated are brought over the borders of the unnamed country, where they instantly die, as death has not ceased working elsewhere on the globe. The industry develops so quickly that the government itself becomes beholden to the maphioso, even bringing it to the brink of war with its neighbors. Death reemerges not long thereafter, this time as a woman named death (the lowercase name is used to signify the difference between the death that ends life, and the Death who will end all of the Universe). She announces, through a missive sent to the media, that her experiment has ended, and people will begin dying again. However, in an effort to kill more kindly, death will now send a letter to those about to perish, giving them a week to prepare for their demise. The violet-envelope-encased letters create a frenzy in the country, as people are not just returned to dying, but also must face the specter of receiving one of these letters and having their fate sealed with it. From here, the story largely focuses on death's relationship with an otherwise unremarkable cellist who, amazingly, will not die. Every time death sends him his letter, it gets returned. Death discovers that, without reason, this man has mistakenly not been killed. Although originally intending merely to analyze this man and discover why he is unique, death eventually becomes infatuated with him, so much so that she takes on human form to meet him. Upon visiting the cellist, she plans to personally give him the letter; instead, she falls in love with him, and, by doing so, she becomes even more human-like. The book ends, as it began, by stating that no one died the next day. Style As with many of his other works, Saramago largely eschews traditional forms of grammar and punctuation. Many of his sentences are written in a style almost akin to stream of consciousness. Saramago avoids using quotations to signify speech, instead relying on inline text, and the usage of capitalization to signify the start of a new speaker's words. Often, instead of using periods, Saramago uses commas to break up sentences. He avoids the capitalization of proper nouns (i.e., names of people or places) and especially of his protagonist \\"death\\" who emphatically insists that her name be written lowercase.

Hays was a progressive democrat and long-time member of the Indiana House of Representatives serving from 1970 until his retirement in 1996. Early life and education Jeff Hays was born the youngest of four in Archer City, Texas to Joseph Colin and Vera Pruitt Hays. The family moved to Evansville, Indiana during World War II. Hays graduated from Evansville Reitz Memorial High School, class of 1947, a standout player on the school's basketball, football, and baseball teams. In the fall of that year, he entered Evansville College (now University of Evansville) on a football scholarship as a quarterback, later receiving his undergraduate degree with a major in Marketing and a minor in Journalism. Upon canceling college deferments, he was drafted into the U.S. Army in August, 1951. After completing military service, he re-entered the University of Evansville at night completing degree work and graduating in 1955. Military service Hays was a veteran of the Korean War, where he was awarded the bronze star for valor. After serving on the front lines, Hays was assigned to the Division Headquarters in the office of Public Information as an Army correspondent, gathering news stories from soldiers for publication in the Division Newspaper, Stars and Stripes, American Newspapers and in the Soldier's Home Town Newspaper. Later he went to Tokyo, Japan to edit the Division Newspaper at an Australian newspaper print shop. Indiana State Representative Hays served in the House of Representatives of the Indiana General Assembly from 1970 to 1996, representing Evansville's Central City and Southeastern Vanderburgh County. He was a member of the powerful tax writing Ways and Means Committee, and his involvement shaped state tax and fiscal legislation. He also was Chairman of the House Commerce Committee and became an expert on utility issues. During Hays' tenure and in large part through his support, Indiana State University at Evansville gained independence from Indiana State University and is now the University of Southern Indiana. Hays was also a major opponent of tax abatements for corporations, stating that they shift the tax burden from corporations to citizens. Hays believed that communities are often forced to offer such abatements to lure corporate investment or to appease corporations when they threaten plant closures or layoffs. His contention was that these tax breaks usually netted little long-term return for the communities that offered them. Hays supported Senator Edward Kennedy for President in 1980 and introduced him at a major speech in Evansville. Hays was a delegate at the 1992 Democratic convention in New York City when future president Bill Clinton was nominated for President. He was a Democratic Nominee for Mayor of Evansville in 1975, losing to Russell G. Lloyd, Sr. Upon his retirement, Hays commented, \\"Most of the issues I've seen before. It's time to turn it over to new people. I'm glad I was able to recognize that.\\" Non-political career Hays spent ten years as Editor of The Message Newspaper of the Catholic Diocese of Evansville. He also served as Director of Purchasing at the University of Southern Indiana from 1977 to 1992. In 1999, he began work as a lobbyist for five years in the Indiana State Legislature with the Hays Murray Group. An avid writer, he contributed frequently to the local paper, the Evansville Courier & Press, and to The Evansville Boneyard, an online political commentary website. In 2007, Hays wrote a book, My 10 Years in the Boneyard, a compilation of his articles published on the website. Death and legacy Hays was preceded in death by his wife, Mary Lou Hays, two sisters, and one brother. Surviving him are his five children: Lisa Hays Murray, Laurie Hays Becher, Lynn (Hays) Cosier, Christine (Hays) Henson, and John Jefferson Hays, II along with 12 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren. With his five children present, the former legislator was memorialized in a joint resolution of the Indiana General Assembly on March 3, 2009. The resolution recognizes his contributions to the State House of Representatives and to the State of Indiana. He is remembered as a political liberal and champion of civil and human rights. Once asked if he wanted to be remembered as a statesman, Hays declined, saying, \\"I would like to be remembered as a politician. A statesman is thought of as being above the people, while a politician is of the people\\".

It is the court of last resort and the highest appellate court in the country. It is located in the city centre of Namibia's capital city, Windhoek. A Supreme Court decision is supreme in that it can only be reversed by an Act of Parliament that contradicts it, or by another ruling of the Supreme Court itself. History Namibia's Supreme Court was founded on 21 March 1990, the day of Namibian Independence. Although it has the Supreme Court of South-West Africa as its predecessor, the latter was not a supreme court in the sense that appeals against its rulings would be allowed; the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa would hear those, and they would be prosecuted by the Supreme Court of South-West Africa. Court building At its inception in 1990, the Supreme Court did not have its own building. The Supreme Court building, situated in Michael Scott Street on Eliakim Namundjebo Plaza in central Windhoek, was built between 1994 and 1996 as an \\"imposing and functional building\\" to represent \\"the integrity and soul of the [...] Constitution\\". It was designed in a north African style in order to avoid resemblance of European colonial buildings, and it is Windhoek's only building erected post-independence in an African style of architecture. The building was constructed to contain two court rooms, four offices for justices, and a law library on the first floor. Erection and design of the building involved extensive geotechnical investigations because it is situated on top of a geological fault. Mandate and power The mandate and powers of the Supreme Court are regulated by Articles 78, 79 and 138 of the Namibian Constitution. It hears appeals against High Court decisions and matters referred from the Attorney-General, particularly those that concern constitutional matters. It can also hear matters referred to it by parliamentary authorisation. The Supreme Court regulates its own procedures and makes Rules of Court. A Supreme Court decision can only be reversed by an Act of Parliament that contradicts it, or by another ruling of the Supreme Court itself. Structure and appointment The Chief Justice of Namibia presides over the Supreme Court. They are supported by Judges of Appeal. All Supreme Court judges are appointed by the president on recommendation by the Judicial Service Commission. The Chief Justice is His Lordship Peter Shivute. Notable cases *In 1991, the court confirmed the prohibition of corporal punishment at state schools. It also clarified that this prohibition applies independent of parent's approval or disapproval of the measurement, and even if the pupil themselves agree to be punished in this way. *In 2001, when deciding a state appeal on a granted residence permit (Chairperson of the Immigration Selection Board v Frank and Another), the court noted: \\"The homosexual relationship, whether between men and men and women and women, clearly fall outside the scope and intent of Article 14\\" of the Constitution of Namibia (protection of the family). *In a civil matter spinning off from the Caprivi treason trial the Supreme Court of Namibia ordered government in 2002 (Government of Namibia and Others vs. Mwilima and Others) to provide the treason suspects with legal representation. In 2010 the court was again involved in this trial, ruling (State vs. Malumo and 24 Others) that confessions from 25 accused are inadmissible before the High Court in Windhoek due to the occurrence of \\"coercive actions\\" at the hands of Police or military to obtain the testimonies. *In 2009 the Supreme Court found that a 2000 agreement on the expansion of the coastal holiday settlement of Wlotzkasbaken (Erongo Regional Council and Others v Wlotzkasbaken Home Owners Association and Another) was unilaterally and unlawfully changed by the Erongo Regional Council, and decided in favour of the home owners. *On 5 February 2020 the court ruled that the use of EVM's without a Verifiable Paper Trail (VPPT) is unconstitutional. It further declined to set aside the Elections carried out using such failed process. This has attracted some controversy.

Toying with a name, The New York Times (\\"This year's No. 1 selling doll, for example, is Cher, introduced by Mego at a suggested retail price of $6.94 to rival the famous Barbie ...\\"; article includes large picture of Cher doll) After the great success of sales of dolls in 1976, another Cher set was released in 1977, including a new wardrobe with a dress, a new doll and a set of interchangeable clothes. The range was closed in 1978 after the release of other toys for the series. The dolls Before becoming available to the general public, a preview of Sonny & Cher dolls was shown in the Mego catalog of the 1976. The dolls had different features from the final versions: Sonny's face was serious, and the arms of Cher were bent at right angles. The final version of the Sonny doll version was given a smile and the arms of Cher were put straight. Both dolls were formally unveiled at The Mike Douglas Show. Mego produced three versions of the Cher doll. The first, packaged in an orange box, had extra-long hair and wore a coral-colored gown with a flared bottom. The second doll, Growing Hair Cher, came in a purple box and featured a \\"Key\\" that kids could use to change the length of Cher's hair. This doll wore a black and silver dress and black open-toed shoes. Growing Hair Cher's dress had a number of subtle style variations, and the doll itself was packaged in two different types of boxes. The third Cher, available in 1978, was more cheaply made, with a hollow plastic body without jointed hands. It was sold wearing a one piece swimsuit in yellow, blue or red. This doll was packaged in a narrower orange box featuring what is commonly referred to as the Cher gypsy picture. Following the discontinuation of the Mego line, remaining Mego Celebrity Doll heads (Cher & Farrah) were sold to O.K. Toys of Pawtuckett Rhode Island where they were placed on even cheaper blow-molded bodies. These were packaged in plastic bags, using the old Mego logos and are commonly referred to by collectors as \\"Baggie Cher & Baggie Farrah.\\" The Sonny doll (produced only in 1976 and only by MEGO) came with a twelve-piece wardrobe, including a sparkling silver lam√© jumpsuit. Cher came with rooted eyelashes and in thirty-two different costumes designed by Bob Mackie. Mego released outfits in five different formats: Purple Box Designer Collection, Green Box Designer Collection, Boutique Collection (1977), Blue Carded fashions and Wards Exclusive Outfit Gift Sets. =Fashions= Cher doll outfits were designed either from Mackie originals or by Mackie himself. They recreated some of Cher's iconic outfits from her TV variety shows including \\"Laverne\\", \\"Indian Squaw\\"(from Half Breed), and \\"Foxy Lady.\\" Most of the clothes were sold individually (or as extras with the dressing room and stage playsets) along with shoes and pink hangers. Each Cher doll or outfit was supplied with a small fold-out brochure which cataloged the various outfits available. Early editions featured cards with the Mackie sketches which fit into the \\"closet\\" mechanism in the dressing room playset. The clothes were sized to fit other Mego Celebrity dolls such as Farrah Fawcett, Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman, and Diana Ross. Following Mego's discontinuation of the celebrity line, the overage of clothes were sold to smaller companies for re- packaging. Many Cher outfits were re-packaged and sold at Toys R Us under the \\"Jordache\\" logo fashion doll line. Other Toys In addition to the dolls, Mego produced other toys affiliated with the Sonny & Cher product line. Many of those toys were available in the 1977 catalog. Cher's Dressing Room is a closet, backstage dressing room, and carrying case for outfits. The Cher Travel Trunk was a holding spot for the doll's many outfits. Mego also released Cher's Infilatable Tent Set and Sonny & Cher's Roadster in 1977. The red Roadster is convertible, and the box shows a picture of Sonny and Cher driving it. Cher Theatre in the Round is a revolving stage with four scenes: the main stage, Sonny's Pizzeria, and Cher's dressing room. It also came with a piano, microphone stand, and dressing table. The Cher's Makeup Center was released in competition with The Barbie Makeup Center and came with curlers and face paint. The last items of the catalog were Cher's Sing Along Phono (a portable record player) and Cher's Fashion Jewelry. Collectables The dolls are collector's items sought by adults who were children in the 1970s, avid Sonny and Cher fans, as well as general doll and pop culture collectors. Mint condition dolls and outfits (still in their packaging) sell for $30 to $400 (US) each and are often offered for sale on auction sites such as eBay. Several defects exist in the after market Mego Cher doll line. The hair often becomes ruined from play, \\"over-brushing\\" and/or becoming wet. Most often it becomes tangled or matted, or plugs get pulled out at the roots. The rooted eyelashes can become frayed and children sometimes pulled them out. The Cher doll also had long molded fingernails which were prone to breaking or wearing with play. Virtually every doll has suffered from \\"Mego Melt\\", a term coined by toy collectors to describe the plastic used by the Mego Corporation deteriorating over time. This has affected virtually every version of the Long Hair Cher and Growing Hair Cher dolls. The plastic used for the doll's torso reacts with the rubberized plastic used for the arms and legs. The result is a melting of the torso at those joining points: shoulder, underarm, hips, and buttocks). Even when stored carefully, this melting often results in the costumes becoming stuck to the dolls. Excessive heat from storage in hot attics or garages exacerbates this problem. Hair and eyelashes are prone to similar deterioration when exposed to high temperatures. The best advice is to store plastic dolls at a controlled room temperature away from light, heat and high humidity. Moisture encourages mold and light accelerates the natural aging process of plastics which is sometimes referred to Polymer degradation or plastic decay.

Tat is a regulatory protein that drastically enhances the efficiency of viral transcription. Tat stands for \\"Trans-Activator of Transcription\\". The protein consists of between 86 and 101 amino acids depending on the subtype.Jeang, K. T. (1996) In: Human Retroviruses and AIDS: \\"A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences\\". Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ed.) pp. III-3‚ÄìIII-18 Tat vastly increases the level of transcription of the HIV dsDNA. Before Tat is present, a small number of RNA transcripts will be made, which allow the Tat protein to be produced. Tat then binds to cellular factors and mediates their phosphorylation, resulting in increased transcription of all HIV genes, providing a positive feedback cycle. This in turn allows HIV to have an explosive response once a threshold amount of Tat is produced, a useful tool for defeating the body's response. Tat also appears to play a more direct role in the HIV disease process. The protein is released by infected cells in culture, and is found in the blood of HIV-1 infected patients. It can be absorbed by cells that are not infected with HIV, and can act directly as a toxin producing cell death via apoptosis in uninfected \\"bystander\\" T cells, assisting in progression toward AIDS. By antagonizing the CXCR4 receptor, Tat also appears to selectively encourage the reproduction of less virulent M-tropic (macrophage-tropic) strains of HIV (which use the CCR5 receptor) early in the course of infection, allowing the more rapidly pathogenic T-tropic (T-cell-tropic) strains (which use the CXCR4 receptor) to emerge later after mutating from M-tropic strains. Function and mechanism Like other lentiviruses, HIV-1 encodes a trans-activating regulatory protein (Tat), which is essential for efficient transcription of the viral genome. Tat acts by binding to an RNA stem-loop structure, the trans-activating response element (TAR), found at the 5‚Ä≤ ends of nascent HIV-1 transcripts. In binding to TAR, Tat alters the properties of the transcription complex, recruits the positive transcription elongation complex (P-TEFb) of cellular CDK9 and cyclin T1, and hence increases the production of full-length viral RNA. Tat protein also associates with RNA polymerase II complexes during early transcription elongation after the promoter clearance and before the synthesis of full-length TAR RNA transcript. This interaction of Tat with RNA polymerase II elongation complexes is P-TEFb-independent. There are two Tat binding sites on each transcription elongation complex; one is located on TAR RNA and the other one on RNA polymerase II near the exit site for nascent mRNA transcripts which suggests that two Tat molecules are involved in performing various functions during a single round of HIV-1 mRNA synthesis. The minimum Tat sequence that can mediate specific TAR binding in vitro has been mapped to a basic domain of 10 amino acids, comprising mostly Arg and Lys residues. Regulatory activity, however, also requires the 47 N-terminal residues, which interact with components of the transcription complex and function as a transcriptional activation domain. Tat also uses an unusual transcellular transport pathway. Firstly, it binds with high affinity to Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), found on the inner surface of the cell membrane, this enables Tat recruitment at this level. Tat then crosses the plasma membrane to reach the extracellular space. Tat secretion by infected cells is highly active, and export is the major destination for HIV-1 Tat. Structure The basic region of HIV-Tat protein is suggested to form an alpha helix. The basic region is involved in RNA (TAR, trans-activation response element) binding and Tat proteins thus belong to the family of arginine-rich motif (ARM) RNA binding proteins. Protein transduction domain Tat contains a protein transduction domain, which is therefore known as a cell-penetrating peptide. Originally characterised by Frankel and Pabo (1988) and Green and Loewenstein (1988), this domain allows Tat to enter cells by crossing the cell membrane. The amino acid sequence of the protein transduction domain is YGRKKRRQRRR. The nuclear localisation signal found within the domain, GRKKR, mediates further translocation of Tat into the cell nucleus. The biological role of this domain and exact mechanism of transfer is unknown. Clinical significance Inhibition of Tat has been investigated. It has been suggested that Tat antagonists may be of use in the treatment of HIV infections. Biosantech has developed a novel vaccine called Tat Oyi, which aims at the Tat protein. The company‚Äôs HIV vaccine candidate is not toxic to 48 HIV-positive patients enrolled in a double-blind study taking place in France. A Phase I/IIa study, published in 2016, shows a reduction in viral RNA for one of three doses tested. A dose-dependent response was not observed, raising questions about the robustness of the findings.

A nuclear localization signal is encoded in the rev gene, which allows the Rev protein to be localized to the nucleus, where it is involved in the export of unspliced and incompletely spliced mRNAs. In the absence of Rev, mRNAs of the HIV-1 late (structural) genes are retained in the nucleus, preventing their translation. History A novel protein was found to be involved in the translation of gag and env mRNA. The unknown protein functioned by removing repression of regulatory sequences and was named Art (anti-repression transactivator). Later studies suggested that the protein was involved in regulation of the RNA splicing mechanism. Therefore, the name of the protein was modified from Art to Trs (transregulator of splicing). The most recent studies have shown that the protein has multiple functions in the regulation of HIV-1 proteins, and its name has been changed to Rev (regulator of expression of virion proteins), which more generally describes its function.  Structure  Rev is a 13-kDa protein that is composed of 116 amino acids. Rev‚Äôs sequence contains two specific domains which contribute to its nuclear import and export. The protein typically performs its function as a tetramer. =Arginine-rich motif= The N-terminal region of Rev contains an arginine-rich sequence. The arginine-rich motif (ARM) is located between amino acids 38‚Äì49 of the rev gene and forms an alpha-helical secondary structure. The ARM is a highly specific sequence which allows for the multimerization of Rev proteins, prior to RNA binding. A single base substitution alters Rev‚Äôs ability to form a tetramer. The arginine-rich domain of Rev interacts with the rev-binding element (RBE), which is part of the HIV Rev response element (RRE) located in an intron downstream of the env gene. The domain also contains a nuclear localization signal. =Rev-activation domain (Nuclear export signal) = Rev‚Äôs nuclear export signal is located in residues 71‚Äì82 of the C-terminal region and is leucine-rich. Binding of Rev to viral RNAs containing the RRE allows for mRNA export out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm by a mechanism different than that of cellular mRNAs.  Function  HIV-1 regulatory proteins (including Rev) are translated from completely processed mRNA transcripts, while structural proteins are translated from incompletely spliced transcripts. Completely spliced transcripts are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the same mechanism as cellular mRNA. However, Rev is needed to export incompletely spliced mRNAs in order to produce the viral structural proteins. =Rev localization to the nucleus = The arginine-rich domain of the Rev protein, containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS), allows Rev to enter the nucleus. Entry requires binding between a Rev multimer, Ran-GDP, and importin-Œ≤ (a nuclear transport factor). The Rev NLS is a highly similar sequence to that of the importin-Œ≤-binding site present within importin-Œ±, which allows for the interaction between Rev and importin-Œ≤. The NLS overlaps with the sequence required for RNA-binding. This prevents the NLS from counteracting the export of RRE-containing mRNA transcripts. =Binding of Rev to the RRE= The rev response element (RRE) is a 240 base-pair sequence located in the second intron of the HIV-1 genome, immediately downstream of the env gene. The RRE remains functional if translocated, but needs to remain in the same orientation (cannot be inverted). The RRE is retained by incompletely processed mRNA transcripts. The secondary structure of the RRE creates eight stem-loops. Rev initially binds to the purine-rich stem-loop IIB, then binds to a secondary site in stem-loop I. The RRE sequence is cis- acting, and is necessary to achieve high levels of env mRNA in the cytoplasm. The RRE also facilitates multimerization of the Rev proteins, which is required for Rev binding and function. The Rev protein binds unspliced gag and pol transcripts and incompletely spliced env, vif, vpr and vpu transcripts at the RRE, facilitating export to the cytoplasm. =Genomic exportation from the nucleus= Rev is continuously shuttled between the cytoplasm and nucleus. The shuttling of Rev is regulated by its nuclear localization signal and its nuclear export signal. Once Rev is inside the nucleus, Ran-GDP is phosphorylated into Ran-GTP, causing the importation complex to disassemble. Upon disassembly, Rev‚Äôs NES forms a new complex with CRM1 (exportin-1) and Ran-GTP at the RRE sequence within incompletely spliced transcripts. Following assembly of the complex, the intron-containing RNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Once the pre-mRNAs are in the cytoplasm, Rev dissociates, revealing the NLS. Exposure of the NLS allows for Rev interaction with importin-Œ≤ in order to shuttle Rev back to the nucleus. Rev-directed export of viral RNAs is similar to the mechanism by which snRNAs and the 5s rRNAs are exported, as opposed to the mechanism for export of cellular mRNAs. Rev is able to facilitate export of pre-mRNA transcripts that would otherwise typically remain in the nucleus, suggesting that the Rev NES is dominant over nuclear retention. =Regulation of HIV gene expression= Rev acts post- transcriptionally to positively regulate the expression of structural genes and to negatively regulate the expression of regulatory genes. Rev positively regulates the expression of gag, pol, and env. Rev-mediated export from the nucleus increases cytoplasmic levels of the structural mRNAs (gag, pol, and env). Gag, pol and env expression is lower in the absence of Rev and higher in the presence of Rev. Rev negatively regulates the expression of the regulatory genes (rev and tat) by creating a negative feedback loop, which regulates Rev production. There is a decrease in Rev production when Rev protein levels are higher than is necessary for the given amount of HIV-1 genome encoded. Rev also decreases the quantity of completely spliced viral messages expressed by exporting pre-mRNA before it can be spliced. This results in decreased expression of the regulatory proteins, Rev and Tat. Since Rev is continuously shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm, small amounts of the protein are able to impact many mRNA transcripts. Maintenance of the proper balance between early and late viral gene quantities leads to an overall increase in virion production. =Transition from early to late phase HIV-1 genes= HIV-1 genes are expressed from either completely spliced RNA or from intron- containing RNA. The export of fully spliced mRNAs (early, regulatory genes) occurs in the same manner as the normal export of cellular mRNAs. On the other hand, unspliced and incompletely spliced mRNAs which code for the late, structural proteins are Rev-dependent. The Rev protein is expressed as an early gene from completely spliced transcripts, so the expression of late phase structural proteins cannot occur until an initial amount of Rev is produced. Rev as a target for antiviral therapies Since Rev is absolutely necessary for HIV-1 replication and it is expressed early on in infection, it has been suggested that Rev is a good target for antiviral therapies. Leptomycin B (LMB) binds to CRM1 which prevents the formation of the complex required for export(CRM1/NES/RanGTP/RRE) and ultimately reduces the production of incompletely spliced RNAs. Therefore, structural proteins, which are necessary for virion assembly, are not produced. It has been shown that various organic compounds have the ability to target the Rev/RRE interaction. Neomycin B, diphenylfuran cation, and proflavine are small molecules that can prevent Rev from binding to the RRE sequence. If Rev is incapable of binding to the RRE on the pre-mRNA, the RNA will not be exported to the cytoplasm, also resulting in lack of necessary structural proteins. Other therapies target the Rev protein itself, since it is an essential component of HIV-1 infection. M10 is a mutated form of Rev and has a single amino acid substitution (Aspartic acid to Leucine). If delivered to cells, Rev M10 will compete with the wild-type Rev protein for the RRE binding site, and therefore decrease Rev‚Äôs normal cellular functions. Dihydrovaltrate was also identified as a Rev-export inhibitory congener.

Vpr stands for \\"Viral Protein R\\". Vpr, a 96 amino acid 14-kDa protein, plays an important role in regulating nuclear import of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex, and is required for virus replication in non-dividing cells such as macrophages. Vpr also induces G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in proliferating cells, which can result in immune dysfunction. Vpr is also immunosuppressive due to its ability to sequester a proinflammatory transcriptional activator in the cytoplasm. HIV-2 contains both a Vpr protein and a related (by sequence homology) Vpx protein (Viral Protein X). Two functions of Vpr in HIV-1 are split between Vpr and Vpx in HIV-2, with the HIV-2 Vpr protein inducing cell cycle arrest and the Vpx protein required for nuclear import. Vpr-Binding Protein Vpr-binding protein (VprBP) is a 1,507-amino-acid human protein that contains conserved domains, including YXXY repeats, the Lis homology motif, and WD40 repeats. VprBP acts as a substrate-recognition unit when associated with DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1) as part of a CUL4‚ÄìDDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. When bound to Vpr, VprBP allows Vpr to modulate the catalytic activity of the CUL4‚ÄìDDB1 complex, inducing G2 cell cycle arrest in infected cells. VprBP also regulates p53-induced transcription and apoptotic pathways. p53 is an important tumor suppressor which induces either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In-vitro studies of Vpr  The lack of an in vitro cell culture system that demonstrated a deficit in replication upon infection with viruses in the absence of Vpr has led to some mystery in the function of Vpr. Recently, there has been experiments on monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) using a novel in-vitro infection system. These infected human dendritic cells showed a slower rate of replication when deprived of the Vpr protein in HIV-1 cells. This replication difference occurred in a single round of infection. This was shown to be due to decreased transcriptional output from the integrated HIV viral genome. Using mutational analysis (biochemical identification of mutational changes in a nucleotide sequence), prevention of cell cycle progression into mitosis was shown to be required for LTR-mediated viral expression. These findings suggest that the evolutionarily secured G2 cell cycle arrest function of Vpr (Viral Protein R) is essential for HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, this innovative in-vitro culture system will allow researchers to address mechanisms underlying Vpr- mediated enhancement of HIV-1 replication.

Illustration (c. 1840) for La Nouvelle H√©lo√Øse (1761) by Rousseau Antoine Johannot, known commonly as Tony Johannot (9 November 1803 ‚Äì 4 August 1852), was a French engraver, illustrator and painter. Biography He was born in Offenbach am Main. His father, Fran√ßois Johannot (c. 1760‚Äì1838), owned a silk factory in Germany, where the family had fled after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. He was a painter who was involved in the development of lithography in France. The two older brothers of Tony, Charles and Alfred, were engravers, and Alfred also worked as a painter and draughtsman. Tony learnt engraving from his brothers and helped Alfred produce illustrations of books by James Fenimore Cooper and Walter Scott. Tony came to prefer wood-engraving, but resumed etching in 1845. His historical paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon for the first time in 1831. He became an illustrator much prized for his elegance, his diversity, and the lively character of his drawings, which were converted to engravings either by himself or by such artists as Jacques Adrien Lavieille, √âmile Montigneul, and Alfred Revel. He was praised by Th√©ophile Gautier: :Tony Johannot can be called, without fear of contradiction, the king of illustration. Only a few years ago, no novel, no poem could appear in print without an engraving in wood bearing his signature: such heroines of delicate frame, with the necks of swans, flowing hair, imperceptible foot, he has confided to the rice-paper! How many vagabonds in rags, knights armoured from head to foot, tarasques scaled and clawed, he has tossed upon the butter-coloured and canary-yellow covers of novels of the Middle Ages; all the poetry and all the literature, of both ancient and modern times, has passed through his hands: the Bible, Moli√®re, Cervantes, Rousseau, Walter Scott, Lord Byron, Bernardin de Saint- Pierre, Goethe, Chateaubriand, Lamartine, Hugo: he has comprehended all. His drawings appear in all these admirable volumes, and not one seems out of place. By the sides of these sublime pages, of these harmonious verses, they are an ornament and no stain; whatever these diverse geniuses have dreamt, he has been able to recreate and pull bodily into his art.Th√©ophile Gautier, article in La Presse, 16 June 1845.

Biography  Francisco Casanovas Tallard√° was born in San Gervasio, Barcelona. He took his first music lessons at the Conservatorio de M√∫sica del Liceo of Barcelona and the Town School of Music. He studied harmony and composition with the teachers Lamote de Grignon y Morera and specialised in flute with maestro Vila. Among his classmates was the famous specialist in music theory Joaqu√≠n Zamacois. At the age of fifteen, in 1915, he made his debut in the Gran Teatre del Liceu with the violinist Eduard Toldr√† and the Polish harpsichordist Wanda Landowska, performing Concert No. 5 of Brandenberg, by Johann Sebastian Bach. During the intermission of the act, he performed some arias with the soprano Mar√≠a Barrientos. In 1918 he made his debut with the Orchestra of the Gran Teatre del Liceu in the Palau de la M√∫sica. In 1919 he entered as a soloist in the recently created Orquestra Pau Casals, after being heard by the cellist after whom the orchestra is named, Pablo Casals, in person. With this orchestra, Casanovas performed, among others, in the Champs-√âlys√©es Theatre in Paris due to the celebration of the Olympic Games, 1924. In 1925 he was summoned by Eduardo Granados, son of the famous composer Enrique Granados, to perform the famous solo for the beginning of Rhapsody in Blue, by George Gershwin, with the clarinet; it was the first performance of this work in Spain. At about 1930 he arrives in India for the first time, and makes a concert tour with his jazz orchestra. A short time after this, he was appointed Principal of the Calcutta School of Music. He stayed in India for 27 years. There he became acquainted with Mother Teresa, the Mountbatten family (the last English viceroy in India), Pandit Nehru (Indian Prime Minister), and Gandhi, among others. But probably he kept a closer friendship with Mehli Mehta (father of the orchestra conductor Zubin Mehta, and to whom he taught music), who had established the Bombay Symphony Orchestra, of which he was its conductor and concertmaster. The fruitful musical collaboration with Mehta culminated in 1952 with the concert tour of India given by the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. He performed with the Bombay and Calcutta orchestras in different cities of the country, being Mehli Mehta the concertmaster and Francisco Casanovas the conductor. He also collaborated in India with the Nobel Prize Laureate in Literature Rabindranath Tagore; thus, while the Indian national anthem's lyrics are Tagore's, the harmonisation is by Casanovas. He got a First Prize and the Golden Button playing the saxophone (an instrument which he had learned to play by himself in Paris) in the last edition of the International Interpretation Contest organised by Columbia Records, New York, in 1948, with his work Guajiras para saxof√≥n y piano. He became conductor of the New York Symphonic Jazz Orchestra. Casanovas left India for ever in 1956 and went to Great Britain, where he stayed for some years. In 1959 he returned to Barcelona where he was invited to conduct the best orchestras of the Catalan city (Chamber Orchestra, Symphony Orchestra and Symphonic Jazz Orchestra). Under his expert conduction performed artists such as Benno Moiseiwitsch, Yehudi Menuhin, Gaspar Cassad√≥ and Mehli Mehta. Between 1959 and 1967 he resides in Tarragona, Spain, and conducts the Music Band and the Musical Society La Lira Ampostina and also creates, in the same city, the Chamber Orchestra and the Choral Society Ocells de Montsi√†. He composes, among others, the hymn of the society. At about 1965 he befriends Igor Markevich, first conductor of the Radio Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola Symphony Orchestra, by means of a friend of both, the guitarist Narciso Yepes. After his stay in Amposta, Spain, he moved to Valencia where he conducted the Town Orchestra. He was also in charge of conducting the Music Band and was made principal of Liria Uni√≥n Musical from 1967 to 1969. On December 5, 1969, he was awarded with the Uni√≥n Musical golden badge ¬´on the grounds of his outstanding work¬ª, according to the programme issued at the time. In 1970 he arrived in Torrevieja, Spain, where he was appointed for conducting the Uni√≥n Musical Torrevejense and its Musical Academy. For more than twelve years he forged a whole generation of musicians, many of whom occupy important positions in Valencian and Spanish musical panorama. He died on December 16, 1986, in Murcia, Spain.

The first part, Winter, was published in 1726, and the completed poem cycle appeared in 1730.Sambrook, 2004 The poem was extremely influential, and stimulated works by John Christopher Smith, Joseph Haydn, Thomas Gainsborough and J. M. W. Turner among many others. Context Thomson was educated first at the Parish school of Southdean then at Jedburgh Grammar School and Edinburgh University where he was a member of \\"The Grotesques\\" literary club; some of his early poems were published in the Edinburgh Miscellany of 1720. Seeking a larger stage, he went to London in 1725, and became the tutor of Thomas Hamilton (who became the 7th Earl of Haddington) in Barnet. There he was able to begin Winter, the first of his four Seasons. Blank verse had been considered more of an interesting toy than anything useful to poetry, despite John Milton's epic-scale Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained half a century earlier. Poem The poem was published one season at a time, Winter in 1726, Summer in 1727, Spring in 1728 and Autumn only in the complete edition of 1730. Thomson borrowed Milton's Latin-influenced vocabulary and inverted word order, with phrases like \\"in convolution swift\\". He extended Milton's narrative use of blank verse to use it for description and to give a meditative feeling. The critic Raymond Dexter Havens called Thomson's style pompous and contorted, remarking that Thomson seemed to have avoided \\"calling things by their right names and speaking simply, directly, and naturally\\". Influence The lengthy blank verse poem, reflecting on the landscape of the countryside, was highly influential and much liked for at least a century after its writing. Especially lavish editions were produced between 1830 and 1870 in Britain and America. A dispute over the publishing rights to The Seasons gave rise to two important legal decisions (Millar v. Taylor; Donaldson v. Beckett) in the history of copyright. In 1750, the London bookseller Andrew Millar reprinted the 1746 edition of The Works of James Thomson vol. 1. and included a prefatory note that emphasized the author‚Äôs preference for the 1746 edition. Millar may have referred to the 1744 edition because it was the first expanded version of Thomson‚Äôs famous poem, it sold quickly, and it may have helped to clarify for Millar that he owned the highly valuable copyright of this book in perpetuity. Thomson's The Seasons was translated into German by Barthold Heinrich Brockes (1745). This translation formed the basis for a work with the same title by Gottfried van Swieten, which became the libretto for Haydn's oratorio The Seasons. Artists such as Thomas Medland, Anker Smith and John Neagle (1792) created engravings to accompany the poems. A bathing scene from Summer inspired paintings by Thomas Gainsborough, William Etty (Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed') and Johann Sebastian Bach the Younger. The piece was translated into French by the naturalist Joseph-Philippe-Fran√ßois Deleuze (1753‚Äì1835). Oscar Wilde included this poem, only half-sarcastically, in a list of ‚Äòbooks not to read at all‚Äô.

The Association was formed in 1924, but traces its origins back to 1901, when prison visiting was first officially recognised. The Association became a registered charity in 2003. Structure and functions The Lord Chancellor is ex-officio President, and the Association is run at national level by a small Executive Committee elected by OPVs, and also by a General/Membership Secretary who may be an OPV and a member of the Association. The Executive Committee maintains regular liaison with Prison Service staff at national and regional level; contact is also maintained with agencies working with offenders and those having interest in penal affairs. A regular newsletter is sent to all OPVs. The NAOPV is often approached by the media for information on prison visiting matters and has several times been asked to testify to a House of Commons Committee. =Branches= The NAOPV has a Branch in each prison. The NAOPV sees Branches as strengthening the application and independence of OPVs by giving them group identity. Liaison with prison staff widens experience on both sides. The Branch Chairman and Secretary are points of contact for OPVs, prison staff and other Branches in the region. Branches have joint-strength, and receive support at regional and national level. History The first prison visitors in English and Welsh prisons were probably the family and friends of prisoners who came into prison bringing food and clothing, and this continues today with V.O. (Visiting Order) visits. Ministers of religion also made visits, as did officials carrying out inspections, but for many years there were few others. Early visitors included John Wesley who wrote of visits to Newgate Prison in London by Sarah Peters and Silas Todd and others who began visiting in October 1748. Sarah Martin of Yarmouth began prison visiting in 1810 and was mentioned by the prison inspectorate to be still visiting in 1835. Many names of these early visitors were not recorded. John Howard (prison reformer)'s 1777 book State of the Prisons and his testimonies in Parliament had raised awareness of prison conditions. It was, however, with the advent of Elizabeth Fry's visits to Newgate Prison in 1813 that prison visiting became something of \\"a cause\\". To enable co-operation between prison visitors she and others formed the \\"Ladies Association for the Female Prisoners in Newgate\\". In 1901 this organisation became a national one, the Lady Visitors' Association. By 1900 members of this Association\\" were visiting young male prisoners in addition to females, and in 1922 this was officially recognised at the Boys' Prison at Wandsworth (subsequently transferred to Wormwood Scrubs). Gradually Lady Visitors began to visit adult male prisoners too, although for many years this was without official sanction. It took far longer for men to become involved in the voluntary visiting of male prisoners in any official way, and it was not until Herbert Gladstone's Committee on Prisons of 1895Christopher Harding, ‚Äò'The Inevitable End of a Discredited System'? The Origins of the Gladstone Committee Report on Prisons, 1895‚Äô, Historical Journal, 31 (1988), pp. 591-608 that the idea gained any credence. Even then it was to be many years (the 1920s) before adult male prisoners were able to have the benefit of a male visitor on anything like a regular basis. This was because the presence in prison of a male chaplain was thought sufficient. In 1922 an organisation was formed, at first named \\"Men Visitors Association to Men\\"; this was soon changed to \\"The National Association of Prison Visitors\\" (NAPV). This organisation was at first for men only, but in 1944 the two single sex groups amalgamated and kept the name of the National Association of Prison Visitors. In 2003 the Association became a registered charity and changed its name to the present \\"National Association of Official Prison Visitors\\" (NAOPV), and at the present time promotes and encourages visiting by several hundred Official Prison Visitors in English and Welsh penal establishments.

It was first published in Slovenia (then still part of Yugoslavia) in 1987 under the title of Drobtinice (\\"Crumbs\\"). It sold 54000 copies and won \\"the best Slovenian novel of the year\\" award and \\"Zlata ptica\\" award for excellent artistic achievement by a young writer, 1988. Story The first person narrative follows Egon, a well- read, degenerate chancer living in a non-descript, poverty-ridden foundry town in what was then Yugoslavia (now presumably Slovenia given an allusion to the towns proximity to the Italian border). Most of the town‚Äôs residents work at the foundry, with some occupying the guarded dormitories there. Egon shuns this, instead spending his days bothering his friends and a string of lovers for food, beer, sex, and shelter, something he finds remarkably easy on account of his good looks and charm. He funds what he feels absolutely necessary through writing trashy romances under a pseudonym ‚Äì whether he has higher literary ambitions is unclear. One of these necessities is a perfume he wears ‚Äì Cartier pour l‚Äôhomme. The novel opens with the realisation that he has run out. From there, Egon sets in motion a morally bankrupt plan that will recover him a new bottle. Meanwhile, a friend of his at the foundry is slowly losing his mind to an obsession with a film-star, and relationships Egon had always depended on are falling apart, only to be replaced by new & volatile ones. Over the course of the novel, Egon‚Äôs mental health issues and problems with self-identification begin to surface. The book‚Äôs final chapters are a mess of consequences, as grim as they are hilarious, and indicative of nation undergoing radical change Film In 1991 TV Slovenia made a film based upon the novel - Cartier Project.

In 2007, The film was selected for preservation by the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry, for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Synopsis An elderly woman, nicknamed \\"Peege\\" and played by Jeanette Nolan, lives in a nursing home where she is suffering from blindness and ailing mental faculties. Her family makes regular visits to her every Christmas, but her poor health makes these occasions awkward for everyone else. The conversation is awkward, because most of the family treat Peege in a condescending fashion and talk about their own successes. As the family goes to leave, one of the grandsons (Bruce Davison) remains behind briefly. He recounts to his grandmother that when he was a young boy her laugh would \\"always make [him] happy\\", before tearfully departing, unaware if he has communicated with her. After his exit, the camera lingers on her face and her expression subtly shows he was successful. History After graduating from University of Southern California, Kleiser had struggled creatively while making educational films, and at the behest of his father he returned to college to earn his Master's degree. In the film he originally planned as his thesis, a Los Angeles theater company puts on an experimental play about a time traveller. However, he had intended to supplement the picture with special effects, but if he did so the consequent budget would be $5,000 more than he could afford; he would only be able to complete it by renting equipment from USC and ceding the copyright to them. Unwilling to lose ownership of his movie, he instead followed the advice of producer Curtis Harrington, who suggested he abandon the project in favor of a more personal and intimate subject. He chose to write about his own family's visits to his grandmother, also nicknamed \\"Peege\\", when she was in a nursing home in Pennsylvania. Each trip found her in poorer health, to the point where, according to Kleiser, he \\"dreaded visiting\\". The family's final journey to see her served as the inspiration for the script. Production There were no problems during shooting, and indeed the production enjoyed more than its share of good fortune. Producer David Knapp was also working on a CBS television movie at the same time (Steven Spielberg's Something Evil), and since that film had wrapped ahead of schedule, the Peege crew were able to get access to the studio offices for the remaining two weeks of the lease without any cost. Next door to those offices was the studio for the television series Gunsmoke, and Jeanette Nolan, a guest-star on the show, was approached to play the role of the grandmother. Lead actor Bruce Davison had enjoyed recent success as the star of The Strawberry Statement and Willard, but liked the script enough that he agreed to participate for only the Screen Actors Guild statutory minimum wage, and a small share of any profits. Reception Prior to its inclusion in the National Film Registry, Peege had already won several awards, including a Chris Award at the Columbus Film Festival, the top honor at the National Council on Family Relations Film Competition, a Media & Methods Recommended Citation: Maxi Award, and a TEAM Film Award for the Best Film in Family Counseling.

It is customary on this day to eat Laba Congee. The Laba Festival had not been on a fixed day until the Southern and Northern dynasties, when it was influenced by Buddhism and got a fixed time on the eighth day of twelfth month, which was also the enlightenment day of the Buddha. Therefore, many customs of the Laba Festival are related to Buddhism. It corresponds directly to the Japanese Rohatsu and the South Asian Bodhi Day. History Before the Qin dynasty the Laba festival was a celebration of the new harvest. After Buddhism spread to China during the first century CE, the festival was used as commemoration of Gautama Buddha's enlightenment at the age of 35. During the Qing dynasty, ceremonies for the Laba festival would have been held in the Yonghe Temple in Beijing.Temples distribute free Laba porridge CCTV reportsVideo: Laba Festival celebrated with free porridge CCTV reports Customs Traditionally, the consumption of Laba congee was an important element of the festival. In Northeast China, Northwest China and Jiangnan, this custom has been preserved, but it has become rarer in South China . On the first day of spring the government would hold a ceremony called ‚ÄúBeating Spring Ox‚Äù with the purpose of encouraging farming. Officials would use a colorful club to beat an earthen ox after worshiping the God of Grain; this was the so-called ‚ÄúScourging Spring‚Äù. Even today, people in some places name Spring Begins as Beating Spring. After the ritual of ‚ÄúBeating Spring‚Äù, people would compete in grabbing the scattered pieces of the earthen ox, which would dispel pests or ants, and bring them good harvest in farming and abundant production of silk and livestock. Another custom is the soaking of Laba garlic. Garlic is soaked in vinegar for twenty days starting from the Laba festival. The garlic and vinegar is then used alongside Chinese dumplings (or jiaozi) around Chinese New Year . =Laba congee= Congee for the imperial court would have been made of cream, lamb, various mixed grains, dried red dates, longan, chestnuts, peanuts, water caltrop, walnuts, raisins, melon seeds, and haw jelly.

At the time of her marriage to Arthur's father, Clara Maria Caroline was widowed (Dony) with two daughters. Der getreue Ekkehard Arthur Fitger grew up in the grand ducal Posthaus in Delmenhorst which was also an inn which functioned as stopover for change of horses (postillions) and postal/customs exchange between Oldenburg and Bremen (part of the Thurn und Taxis network of the Holy Roman Empire). His younger brother Emil Fitger (born 15 December 1848 in Delmenhorst, died 9 April 1917 in Bremen) was editor in chief of the Weser-Zeitung in Bremen for many years. Arthur Fitger attended the Volks- und Rektorschule in Delmenhorst and then the gymnasium in Oldenburg, where he lived at the home of Baurat Otto Lasius (1797‚Äì1888). =Painting= In 1858, Fitger went to the Akademie zu M√ºnchen, where he studied under Moritz von Schwind (1804‚Äì1875), Peter von Cornelius (1783‚Äì1867) and Bonaventura Genelli (1798‚Äì1868). He went to Antwerp in 1861 and then to Paris. From 1863 to 1865, he stayed in Rome, supported by a scholarship from Oldenburg's grand duke. Then he spent the following years alternately in Vienna und Berlin before moving to Bremen in 1869. Fitger became known for his large decorative works, executed chiefly at Bremen. He decorated the Rembertikirche with two pictures: \\"The lost son\\" and \\"The Merciful Samaritan.\\" He did a frieze for the bourse with maritime allegories. His works also appeared in the Haus Seefahrt and the Reichspostgeb√§ude. Influenced by the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, he produced the portable artwork \\"Barbarossa's Awakening,\\" which spread his reputation further. In 1875, he was given the task of decorating the Ratskeller with murals. From 1883 to 1884 he painted large murals in the Kunsthalle Hamburg. After this he returned to Bremen where he painted murals of nymphs and centaurs in Imperial Hall of the new Imperial Post Office Building. Kaiserliche Oberpostdirektion Originally painting in the style of Cornelius and Genelli, he later used colour in a more modern manner, similar to Hans Makart (1840‚Äì1884). Arthur Fitger was awarded a gold medal for his \\"Icarus\\" painting when exhibited at the 1892-1893 Chicago World's Fair (Columbian Exhibition) =Writing= Fitger was also well known for his writing. His plays, Adalbert von Bremen (Oldenburg 1873; 2nd edition with the sequel Hie Reich! Hie Rom! [\\"Here Empire! Here Rome!\\"], 1875), Die Hexe (\\"The witch,\\" Oldenburg, 1878; 4th edition, 1885), Von Gottes Gnaden (\\"From the grace of God,\\" 2nd edition, Oldenburg, 1884) have often been performed. He also wrote Albrecht D√ºrer, Johann Kepler and Michelangelo and the epic poem Roland und die Rose (1871) for the Bremer K√ºnstlerverein. Fitger's most important written works are the poetry collections Fahrendes Volk (\\"Traveling people,\\" 2nd edition, Oldenburg, 1883) und Wintern√§chte (\\"Winter nights,\\" Oldenburg, 1880). He also rendered into German (1886) Lord Byron's Marino Faliero, and for the Denkmale der Geschichte und Kunst Bremens (\\"Memorials of the history and art of Bremen,\\" 1877) prepared a history of the local cathedral. =Art criticism= Fitger was regarded as an important person in art in Bremen around 1900. His art criticisms, published in the press, had a lasting influence on Hanseatic taste in art. He was chairman of the Kunstverein, and kept a conservative outlook on art. He strongly criticised artists who followed fashions that were modern at that time, including the K√ºnstlerkolonie Worpswede and the contemporary French painters. The most striking example of his criticism was a comment on an attempt by Marie Bock and Paula Becker to exhibit in the Kunsthalle Bremen at the end of 1899. It appeared in the Weser-Zeitung, which was edited by his brother, Emil, at the time: which means: However, his criticism was unable to prevent a breakthrough of the K√ºnstlerkolonie Worpswede.

Early life and education Hope was born on the 11 September 1808, the third son of Louisa WedderburnThe Manx Sun Saturday, 4 November 1893 Page: 13 and John Hope, 4th Earl of Hopetoun. His brother was John Hope, 5th Earl of Hopetoun. In 1841 he married Lady Isabella-Helen Douglas, eldest daughter of Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk.Isle of Man Governors Educated at the University of Edinburgh, he was called to the Scottish Bar in 1831, and later to the English Bar. Career Hope was appointed one of the Commissioners of the Greenwich Hospital in 1841. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Linlithgowshire from 1838 until 1845. =Lieutenant Governorship of the Isle of Man= Following the death of Governor Ready, Hope was appointed Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man on 12 August 1845. On 26 August, together with his wife, Governor Hope arrived at Douglas on board the steamer Mona's Isle having traveled on a special sailing from Kirkcudbright. The new Lieutenant Governor was said to of received a warm reception, with various members of the public bodies and High Bailiff James Quirk in attendance. Governor Hope was sworn in at a ceremony held at Castle Rushen on 27 August, taking up residence at Lorne House, Castletown. Governor Hope's tenure in office was not distinguished by any great public works, save that of the Laxey Wheel which was named in honour of his wife, Lady Isabella. However of particular note is Governor Hope's devotion to duty during the serious cholera outbreak which occurred during his governorship; his visit to the village of Port Erin, at that time severely ravaged by the disease, being such an instance. The general opinion of Governor Hope's time in office was that of a firm, yet mild administrator who had brought about many minor reforms. During Governor Hope's tenure, the Isle of Man was visited by Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort. Governor Hope's retirement from office was due to private reasons, and was announced suddenly to Tynwald during its open air sitting at St John's on 5 July 1860. The statement was said to of been received with astonishment and regret, and various efforts were made to Governor Hope to reconsider his position. Governor Hope and Lady Isabella left the Isle of Man on 16 August 1860, returning to Kirkcudbright. He had held the governorship of the Isle of Man for within 10 days of 15 years. Upon his retirement Governor Hope was initially succeeded by Mark Hildesley Quayle and subsequently by Francis Pigott Stainsby Conant. Later life Hope retired initially to Bridge Castle and then to St Mary's Isle near Kirkcudbright. Prior to 1893 Hope had for some time been in declining health, and the loss of his wife in July of that year came as a further shock. He died on the morning of Tuesday 31 October 1893. He was survived by three sons and two daughters. Hope's grandson, Charles Dunbar Hope-Dunbar, proved his claim to the Dunbar Baronetcy of Baldoon (created in 1664) in 1916 and became the 6th Baronet (see Hope-Dunbar Baronets).

In the 2005‚Äì06 season, Merella was part of the Lancashire County Schools FA team that won the English Schools' Football Association Premier League Under-16 Inter County Trophy. In the semi-final held at Victoria Park, Burscough, he helped Lancashire beat Leicestershire & Rutland County Schools FA 3‚Äì1. They then beat Devon County Schools FA 2‚Äì1 in the final, which was held at Ewood Park in Blackburn on 11 May 2006. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, he was part of the Blackpool youth team that won the Lancashire FA Youth Cup. In the summer of 2008, he was included in the club's pre-season tour to Latvia in July, where he impressed with some solid displays. He also played in most of the club's other pre-season games. On 23 July 2008, he signed his first professional contract, for six months. Merella became a regular in Blackpool's reserve team in The Central League in the 2008‚Äì09 season. In November 2008, it was revealed that Blackpool were willing to let Merella go out on loan in order for him to get some first-team experience, after he continued to impress for the club's reserve team. Merella made his debut for Blackpool on 3 January 2009, as a second-half substitute in their 1‚Äì0 FA Cup defeat to Conference National club Torquay United. However, in late January he was released by Blackpool. In early February Merella joined League Two club Bournemouth on trial, trying to earn a contract. After briefly joining Conference North club Burscough, in late March he joined Conference National club Weymouth. He made his debut in a home 2‚Äì0 defeat to Barrow at the Wessex Stadium on 29 March.

The scientific name was assigned for the skull that was originally described to be that of an extinct species of cheetah, endemic to Asia during the Late Pliocene sub-epoch. It was estimated to have lived around 2.2 to 2.5 Ma BP, existing for approximately . The fossil discovery was reported in 2008, and was claimed to be the most primitive Acinonyx lineage so far discovered. Further, the study concluded that the cheetahs originated in the Old World, not the New World as previously believed. It was thought to share some features with the modern cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, such as in having enlarged sinuses for air intake during sprinting, while its teeth show primitive features. After a long suspicion of the authenticity of the fossil, it was finally accepted as a forgery in 2012. Discovery and description The fossil skull was discovered in 2008 and described in 2009 by Per Christiansen, from the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen, and Ji H. Maz√°k, of the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum, in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA. It was reported as being discovered from the Late Pliocene, fossiliferous-rich ‚ÄúHezheng‚Äù locality in Linxia basin (hence the popular name \\"Linxia cheetah\\"), in the south-eastern part of Gansu Province, China. The species name was given in honour of Bj√∂rn Kurt√©n, the late professor of paleontology at the University of Helsinki. The skull was almost complete except for the occipital condyles, basioccipital region and upper canines. It resembles the true cheetahs in having a tall skull with a domed structure, a very wide braincase relative to skull length, enlarged frontal sinuses, a large nasal aperture, and a well-developed occipital crest. But the upper premolars are very primitive, like those of some extinct felines. It is older than earlier described species, such as the European Acinonyx pardinensis (dated to about 2.2 Ma old) and the North African Acinonyx aicha (about 2.5 Ma old). Thus, it apparently disproved the prevailing notion that cheetahs originated in the New World. Discrediting Even at the time of pre-publication of the research paper in 2008, there were already strong doubts about the veracity of the fossil. Tao Deng, Professor of Paleontology at the Institute for Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in China, upon proofreading the manuscript, noted the possible forgery of the fossil, and immediately reported this to PNAS. Just from the published pictures, Deng said that he could see that parts of the skull had been concocted from plaster. The technical give away was that the parietal area appeared glued together from disparate bone pieces, to imitate the skull of a modern cheetah. He noted that parts of the skull were created from plaster, and are missing part of the parietal crests. However, his objection to publication was denied in an editorial letter on 5 February 2009, on the grounds that Deng had not personally examined the fossil. Qiu Zhanxiang, a global expert in mammalian craniums, also supported the claim that the skull was forged. Since then it has been criticised publicly by a number of paleontologists in China. However, Maz√°k denied anyone else access to the fossil, and upon inquiry, the senior author, Christiansen, had never seen the original specimen. By 2010, there was increasing suspicion in the scientific community that the fossil was fake, including a number of others from China. The two discoverers responded with a published defense of their fossil. In 2012, Deng was finally allowed access to the original fossil upon invoking the PNAS data access policy, and on examination, his primary observations were proven correct. He concluded that the fossil has been collected from the Late Miocene (several million years older than estimated in the original publication) red clay in Guanghe County, and not from the reported region in Dongxiang County. In addition, the zygomatic arches of the skull were made from ribs, the incisors were actually premolars from other carnivores, and the posterior part of the skull was simply a crude plaster. Deng asked Maz√°k to retract the paper. Maz√°k finally conceded by stating (on 20 August 2012 in PNAS) that: ‚Äúafter further examination, it was determined that the fossil used in the study was a composite specimen from the late Miocene laterite and not from the early Pleistocene loess. The article is hereby retracted.‚Äù  References  kurteni Category:Fossil taxa described in 2008 Category:Prehistoric felines Category:Archaeological forgeries ","title":"Acinonyx kurteni"},{"id":"20938233","text":"Prestwold Hall is a country house in Leicestershire, England, standing in of land in the parish of Prestwold.

Kelly's Directory of Leicestershire & Rutland (1899)Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire 1855, p.57 The Packe Family Prestwold Hall has been the seat of the Packe family for over 360 years since it was acquired by Sir Christopher Packe (1595 ‚Äì 1682) in 1649, shortly after the death of Charles I. He was nominated by Cromwell to be one of the sixty who were to create a new senate, and he introduced the Humble Petition and Advice to Parliament, being an offer of hereditary monarchy to Cromwell. This was the apex of his rise to fame and fortune. The Restoration came, however, and it was remembered that Christopher, ‚ÄòLord Packe,‚Äô late Lord Mayor of London, had been one of the aldermen who proclaimed the abolition of the monarchy in May 1649. Regicides had been among his intimate friends. In August 1660, Packe was disqualified from holding any public office, and retired to Prestwold, where he lived to the age of 87. In the 1760s, Charles James Packe (1726 ‚Äì 1816) rebuilt the Hall, and soon after created the park around it. Standing on the northern part of the East Lawn runs a line of cedars, already in 1780 said to be of notable size. Five years after Charles William Packe (1792 ‚Äì 1867) inherited Prestwold in 1837, the house was largely remodelled by the defining Scottish architect William Burn. One of his earliest English commissions, it is one of the finest examples of a William Burn house in the neoclassical style. The interior of the house is noted for its exceptional marbled plaster work in the Italian style, remarkable for both the scale and the quality of the work. Within the house, there is a notable collection of twentieth century portraiture and of eighteenth century English and European furniture. Prestwold Hall passed to the Drury-Lowe family in 1936 when Penelope Mary, the daughter of Sir Edward Hussey Packe, married John Drury Boteler Drury-Lowe (1905-1960). Drury-Lowe adopted the additional surname of Packe - his son, Simon Jasper Packe-Drury-Lowe, inherited the house and estate in 1938. Prestwold Hall remains to this day the home of the Packe- Drury-Lowe family. The Hall The Hall was remodelled by architect William Burn in 1842‚Äì1844, incorporating the fabric of a mid-18th-century H-plan house. It was Grade I listed in 1951. One of the finest rooms inside the house is the Entrance Hall with its richly coloured marbled plaster work in the Italian style. The painted ceiling was inspired by Raphael‚Äôs Vatican grotesques and incorporates miniature landscapes, showing the house before and after its remodelling between 1842 and 1844. Below the ceiling, wreathing the room, are small medallion busts of the poets from Chaucer to Scott, positioned in the spandrels and are likely inspired by Alberti's external arcade at the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini. An arcade opens on to a vaulted corridor leading to a top lit inner hall: these spaces also marbled. Off the corridor, the cantilevered stone staircase survives from the eighteenth century house, and was given its bracketed brass balusters by William Wilkins (1751-1815) in 1805. The Dining Room, added by Wilkins in 1805, was incorporated into the remodelling undertaken by the Scottish architect William Burn in 1842. The room is overlooked by two dramatic full length portraits of Sir Edward Hussey Packe, KBE (1878 ‚Äì 1946) and the Hon. Lady Mary Sydney Packe (n√©e Colebrooke, 1890 ‚Äì 1973) by the painter Glyn Philpot RA (1844 ‚Äì 1947). The portrait of Lady Packe, painted in 1911, was described by the art historian Robin Gibson OBE as an ‚Äòamazing feat of virtuosity‚Äô. Its elongated elegance and introspective characterisation is totally without the fashion-plate vulgarity of much Edwardian portraiture. Other portraits hang in this room of the Packe family including a painting of Sir Christopher Packe (1595 ‚Äì 1682) who purchased the house in the 17th century painted by Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen (1593 ‚Äì1661). The library extends nearly the entire length of the house when the large doors that separate it from the drawing room are opened, connecting the two rooms. With clever use of constructional steel, William Burn was able to create these long adjoining rooms. The windows rise from floor level and open onto the garden which enhances the notion that Prestwold was designed in the style of an Italian classical villa. The doors and bookcases in library were made for George Hussey Packe (1846‚Äì1908) by Gillows of Lancaster and London in 1875. A conservatory fills the recessed central bay at the front of the house, and projects out towards the garden. Behind the glass and elegant Doric pilasters, are well planted raised beds with a number of exotic plants and flowers. Before Burn's reworking of the gardens in 1842 the house was set on an informal lawn with shrubberies and trees to north, east and west, and with the main entrance to the south. This arrangement was probably established when Charles James Packe (1726 ‚Äì 1816) had the park laid out c 1770. The author and antiquary, John Nichols, commended Charles James Packe's ‚Äòextensive planting‚Äô which, ‚Äòbosomed [the house] in calm serenity‚Äô. During the restyling of the house Burn added the porte coch√®re and entrance to the west and created the garden that now lies to the south, with its well planted beds reflecting the classical symmetry of the house. The garden runs to a stone-balustraded parapet with views south onto the park. The parapet continues east to define the boundaries of the East Lawn, which extends for 100 yards east of the house with a grass terrace and a line of cedars, already in 1780 said to be of 'notable' size. From the house are views south, across the gently rising parkland. In the 1760s Charles James Packe, rebuilt the Hall and soon after created the park around it. As John Nichols writes in The History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester, Volume III, Part I, published in 1800: > ‚ÄòThe grounds before [the house] are spacious, and possess much of a park- > like appearance; and the house, in every point of view shews itself > delightfully shaded with wood, being ornamented with large plantations of > forest-trees; Mr Packe having, perhaps, planted and raised within the last > thirty years, more trees than any gentleman in this county.‚Äô Near the house stands the Grade II* listed church of St Andrew, a medieval parish church largely rebuilt in 1890 by the architect Sir A Blomfield. It is all that remains of the medieval village of Prestwold, which was demolished during the enclosure of the estate. The Estate The Prestwold Estate extends over 1000 hectares of farmland and includes Wymeswold Airfield. Wymeswold Airfield has one of the longest runways in the county, second to the East Midlands International Airport. The airfield was used during The Second World War for training bomber pilots. Wellington bombers, which were operated from the airfield, are very large planes without a great deal of propulsion, hence the requirement for 2000 yards of tarmac. Today, the airfield's primary use is for motor sports, on the purpose-built motor circuit that snakes around the airfield. A number of events are held on the Estate through the year, ranging from festivals to Cross Country Championships. Renewable Energy Much in the tradition of the Victorian stately home, modern technology still plays a part in the running of the house today. Electricity for the house is provided by two rows, 100 yards long, of photovoltaic panels in the walled garden producing 50 kW of power. The heating for the house is supplied by a biomass boiler situated near the panels which provides hot water with a series of flow and return pipes to the house. This means the house is lit and heated efficiently and predominantly from renewable energy sources. The photovoltaic cells positioned on of land at Wymeswold Airfield form one of the largest solar farms in Europe and upon its completion Wymsewold Solar Farm was the largest in the United Kingdom. The panels were connected to the National Grid in 2013 and the 130,000 panels produce enough energy to power approximately 7,500 homes.

Deputy Prime Minister Libertine Amathila declared that the government would spend 65 million Namibian dollars to assist the displaced.2008 - the year that was Namibia Economist, 19 December 2008 Long-term impacts included damage to farmland, housing, schools, roads and infrastructure across the region. The floods reduced the resilience of the population who were left vulnerable to further flooding which occurred in 2009.  Background  The floods hit the northern Namibian regions of Omusati, Oshikoto, Oshana, Ohangwena, and Caprivi. These regions are the most densely populated in the nation with an estimated 859,975 people, almost half of the total population. Northern Namibia has a semi-arid climate with high temperatures. The rain patterns are unpredictable, with varying amounts and timing, although the rainy season tends to fall from November to April. The majority of the people living in the rural areas of northern Namibia rely on subsistence farming, but the poor soil, largely composed of clay and sand mixture, is not ideal for crop production. This results in high levels of chronic food insecurity in these regions. These threats are exacerbated by poor health outcomes, as large swaths of the population do not have access to adequate medical services. HIV/AIDS is especially prevalent in the area, with an estimated 23% of Namibians aged 15 to 49 testing HIV-positive.  Immediate Impacts  Health & Well-being = 289x289px An estimated 65,000 people were affected by the floods. 71 casualties were reported by March 2008 of which there were 42 deaths. Deaths were predominantly children and the elderly who drowned crossing oshonas (flood plains) at night. Wounds resulting from walking in water were a problem in Caprivi. Outreach clinics in rural areas were cut off by the flooding. Relocation camps were set up in the Engela District and Oshana Region and housed over 4,600 of the displaced. Camps had limited or no access to latrines, waste disposal and clean tap water, and some camps were overcrowded. An outbreak of cholera at Engela in the Ohangwena Region was announced in March. An assessment undertaken 19‚Äì20 March by the World Health Organization (WHO) identified that the case fatality rate (CFR) for cholera may be under recorded and reported common acute diseases in the under fives to include malaria, diarrhea and respiratory infections. Cholera cases were also reported at Odibo and Okatope. By the 16th of April, 958 cases of cholera, including four deaths, had been reported. Engela Hospital, which was inaccessible by road, opened a cholera treatment centre. WHO figures for cholera in Namibia for 2008 were 3,496 with 38 deaths (1.09% CFR)World Health Organisation (2009) Weekly epidemiological record: Cholera 2008.

Available at: https://www.who.int/wer/2008/wer8331.pdf?ua=1 =Food Security= Cultivating mahangu The floods significantly reduced yields of mahangu, the staple cereal food for the majority of the population in the Northern Central regions.Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Programme (2009) Livestock and Food Security Assessment Mission to Namibia. Rome. Available at: http://www.fao.org/tempref/docrep/fao/012/ak334e/ak334e00.pdf The household stocks of mahangu were not expected to last beyond next the harvest, forcing the household to use savings to purchase food. As low-income households could not easily compensate by lowering already minimal non-food expenditure, they were likely to shift food consumption towards lower calorie and less nutritious foods or simply reduce their food intake. The European Food Safety Authority mission estimated that compared to the previous agricultural season, there was an average 59% drop in production in the North Central Regions and 46% in affected areas of Caprivi. As a result, 16.4% of the flood affected households in the Northern Central regions were food insecure rising to 32.5% in Caprivi, an area with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. These households were unable to meet their daily nutritional requirements. The population affected by the floods went from chronically food insecure to acutely food insecure. An estimated 52,000 people were in immediate need of assistance to cover their basic food needs in flood-affected areas.  Response  The Namibian government declared a state of emergency on 5 March 2008UNICEF (2008) Nambia Floods: UNICEF responds to the immediate needs of affected children and women.

Working jointly with humanitarian agencies including UN, the government assessed damage extent and established critical needs in the affected areas. The government of Namibia provided food supplies worth N$221,000 and non-food commodities worth N$5.3 million and pledged N$65 million to assist the displaced. The Emergency Management Unit in the Office of the Prime Minister delivered necessary food items to the affected regions using helicopters following roads damage. Flood victims were evacuated to relocation centres in the Engela District and Oshana Region. The Namibian Red Cross supported over 40,000 people, who were moved back to their homes by end of August 2008.Namibia Red Cross. (2008) Annual Report. Namibia. Available at: https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/2EECF3D53B677FB6C12576340036EE67-Full_Report.pdf The Red Cross distributed blankets, hygiene kits, water makers, mosquito nets, bar soaps in North-western regions. In partnership with the Swedish Red Cross the Red Cross also provided agricultural items such as millet, sorghum, goats and chicken to improve food security among the most vulnerable in Ohangwena region. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs triggered the International Charter \\"Space and Major Disasters\\" to help the country battle against floods and the subsequent cholera outbreak that ravaged the country. UNICEF trained community health activists, produced radio messages on cholera prevention and distributed water purification tablets in the affected areas.  Aftermath  289x289px Since 2008, when the first serious Namibia floods disaster occurred, they have become a devastating, almost annual event that finds most households hardly recovered from the previous flood. The communities in the rural areas of North and Central Namibia were most affected by the floods. Their livelihoods are dependent on subsistence farming and the floods increased livestock and household vulnerability of the farmers. Water logging and retention due to the floods was associated with the loss of land productivity and soil degradation. The declining quality of soil affected the farming of major staple crops, sorghum and mahangu, which escalated food prices in the region furthering household food insecurity. Livelihoods were affected after livestock died from drowning in large numbers, whilst the poor prevailing conditions made those remaining susceptible to diseases and parasites such as Lumpy skin disease and the African swine fever. Other impacts were on public infrastructure like roads, bridges, sewerage system, health facilities, market places and schools which were damaged extensively. Rehabilitation work in flooded areas went beyond repairs to include the elevation of roads and improvements to the drainage system. The cost of this was 5.5 times the value of replacing damaged structures.World Bank, (2013). Building Resilience: Integrating climate and disaster risk into development.

It connects Noordoewer in the south on the South African border with Oshikango in the north on the Angolan border via Namibia's capital city Windhoek. The route exists in two discontinuous sections: a southern section from Noordoewer to Windhoek, and a northern section from Okahandja to Oshikango. The central section between Windhoek and Okahandja, previously part of the B1, was upgraded to freeway standard beginning in the 1970s and continuing to 2022, with the freeway sections now carrying the designation of A1. The entirety of the B1, together with the former section of B1 now designated A1, forms part of the Tripoli-Cape Town Highway. The section between Otjiwarongo and Otavi is part of the Walvis Bay-Ndola-Lubumbashi Development Road, and the former central section of the B1 (both prior to and after its redesignation to A1) forms part of the Trans-Kalahari Corridor. Route Important cities that the B1 passes through in a North-South direction include Oshikango, Ondangwa, Tsumeb, Otavi, Otjiwarongo, Okahandja, Windhoek, Rehoboth, Mariental, Keetmanshoop and Noordoewer. =Southern section: Noordoewer to Windhoek= The B1 begins on the South African border at a bridge over the Orange River near the town of Noordoewer, as a continuation of South Africa's N7 national route. It heads north to Gr√ºnau, where it meets the B3 from Karasburg (and Upington from continuing on South Africa's N10 national route) and the Nakop- Windhoek railway line. From there, it continues north to the city of Keetmanshoop; on the southern outskirts, it intersects by means of a traffic circle with the B4 to L√ºderitz. From Keetmanshoop, the route continues north along the western fringes of the Kalahari Desert, passing through Mariental, Kalkrand and Rehoboth. The route then passes through a mountainous region and emerges in the southern suburbs of Namibia's capital city Windhoek near Eros Airport. =Central section: Windhoek to Okahandja= Most of the section between Windhoek and Okahandja has been upgraded to freeway standard (beginning with a western bypass of Windhoek built in the 1970s), and since April 2017, the freeway sections have been redesignated by the Roads Authority Namibia as the A1. Remaining sections of the B1 just south of Okahandja are expected to be upgraded to freeway standard by 2022. =Northern section: Okahandja to Oshikango= From Okahandja, the B1 resumes and heads north for approximately to Otjiwarongo; this section is considered one of the deadliest roads in Namibia with a high crash fatality rate. From Otjiwarongo, the B1 heads in a more north-easterly direction to avoid the Etosha National Park, passing through Otavi (where the B8 provides a route to the Caprivi Strip and the border with Zambia) before reaching Tsumeb. At Tsumeb, the route makes a hard turn to the north-west at the intersection with the B15 and skirts the Etosha Pan to reach Oshivelo and thence Ondangwa, from where it resumes a northerly path and heads to Oshikango. At Oshikango, the route crosses the border into Angola and becomes the EN 120. History The northern stretch of the road from Tsumeb to Ondangwa via Namutoni was built in 1957‚Äì58. Ca. a decade later it was paved, but now it went through Oshivelo, and the paved section went from Ondangwa to Oshakati. The stretch from Ondangwa to Oshikango was still a gravel road.

Originally written by Centram Systems West, the company was purchased by Sun Microsystems as part of Sun's development of the NFS ecosystem.\\"Sun Microsystems Inc. / Centram Systems West, June 1, 1988\\", Venture Returns The Centram company was renamed to TOPS after its acquisition by Sun. Sales of TOPS dried up after the introduction of System 7, which featured a similar file sharing system built- in, and Sun spun off their NFS developments to Sitka. Early versions TOPS was implemented in the 1980s, an era where each computer system featured its own networking protocol and were generally unable to talk to each other. At the time Apple was in the midst of the Macintosh Office effort, and was working with two external companies to develop the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), built on top of AppleTalk. The Macintosh Office effort ultimately failed, and one of the two companies, Centram, decided to implement a similar system on their own. This became the first version of TOPS. When TOPS was originally released there was no peer-to-peer file sharing solution on the Mac. According to PC Magazine, connecting a Mac to an Apple LaserWriter printer was the initial intended function of AppleTalk. Apple's own file sharing solution, AppleShare, was not released until later, and unlike TOPS it required a dedicated server machine to run on, at least a Mac Plus. For smaller offices TOPS was an attractive low-cost solution, and saw relatively widespread use. Even after the introduction of AppleShare, TOPS managed to hold on to an estimated 600,000 client installs.John Battelle, \\"TOPS works hard to hold networking lead\\", MacWEEK, 3 October 1989 TOPS was initially a protocol using a custom set of remote procedure calls and able to talk only between TOPS clients.Tim Maroney, \\"File Servers versus Disk Servers\\", MacTech, Volume 3, Issue 4 PCs generally lacked networking of any sort, and Centram addressed this problem by introducing a line of LocalTalk cards for the PC, along with a TOPS client.\\"TOPS peer-to-peer file sharing\\" Files could be exchanged between the two computers, with filename conversion as required. FlashTalk Centram later introduced the \\"FlashTalk\\" networking system that used external clocking to improve LocalTalk performance. The Zilog SCC powering the serial ports on the Mac used an internal 3.6864 MHz clock that could then be divided down to provide different standard bit rates. The fastest rate available internally was 230.4 kbit/s, used by LocalTalk. However, the system also allowed the clock to be read from a pin in the serial port, giving rise to the possibility of faster speeds with the right external equipment. FlashTalk combined a conventional LocalTalk-like dongle with a clocking source and an external power supply. Using these connectors, and the associated software, TOPS could run at 770 kbit/s. This was not only a fairly dramatic improvement over LocalTalk, but also relatively speedy overall in an era when 1 Mbit/s networks were still common. TCP/IP Support After the Sun purchase, TOPS was given the problem of making a client that could also access Sun file shares using NFS. Centram solved this problem by porting their file sharing protocol to TCP/IP.\\"Sitka Corp.\\", Software Magazine, 1 March 1991 This was not trivial; neither Mac OS nor Windows supported TCP/IP \\"out of the box\\", so what was now the TOPS Division of Sun had to write a complete IP stack for the Mac and Windows.\\"TOPS Terminal\\" Centram had already written such a stack for their \\"TOPS Terminal\\", a freeware (but not open source) Telnet terminal for the Mac. Additionally, the majority of Macintosh systems used LocalTalk (or PhoneNet) for connectivity, and could not be directly connected to the Ethernet-based Unix LANs. They worked around this problem by supporting an emerging LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridging standard known as \\"KIP\\", short for Kinetics Internet Protocol. KIP encapsulated TCP/IP packets inside AppleTalk packets, allowing them to be sent over existing LocalTalk connections. Dedicated KIP-supporting network bridges were available that stripped off the AppleTalk packaging, re-formed the IP packets inside, and sent them out over Ethernet. One limitation of the TCP stack was that it did not support DNS, requiring users to type in IP addresses of the peers they wanted to communicate with. In a network of mostly Macs or Windows PCs this was not an issue, as DNS was not widely used with these systems at that time. KIP also reduced the need for DNS, as it allowed a Mac's existing Address Resolution Protocol (AARP) code within AppleTalk to look up the AppleTalk address of the remote peer, and then communicate with the TOPS stack on that machine to find the corresponding IP address. TOPS also added the new \\"InBox Personal Connection\\" e-mail system, first developed by Symantec.\\"TOPS upgrades InBox PC client software\\", MacWEEK, 4 April 1989 Decline TOPS' attractiveness was seriously eroded with the introduction of System 7 in 1991. TOPS had initially competed against the dedicated-server AppleShare, but System 7 included a file sharing server built-in, one that proved to be much faster than then-current versions of TOPS. TOPS sales dwindled and Sun spun off the division as Sitka, before closing it entirely in 1993.Lisa Picarille, \\"SunSelect closes TOPS operation; cites companywide cost cutting\\", MacWEEK, 12 July 1993 See also * MacServe * Macintosh Office References Category:Network file systems Category:Sun Microsystems software Category:Macintosh platform Category:1986 software Category:Computer-related introductions in 1986 ","title":"TOPS (file server)"},{"id":"20938372","text":"The National Health Council (NHC) is a nonprofit association of health organizations.

His first taste of solo stardom came as a guest artist on label-mate Tinchy Stryder's single \\"Spaceship\\", which was released in June 2011. While deciding upon his debut solo single, Dappy was contacted by Def Jam, asking him what he would like done with the demos of a track N-Dubz had recorded whilst under the label, which remained unreleased. Dappy decided to re-record the track, \\"No Regrets\\", and release it as his debut solo effort. Featuring a cameo appearance from band-mate Fazer, \\"No Regrets\\" took the charts by storm, peaking at #1 in the UK and Scotland, and at #8 in Ireland.

In 2019, Dappy collaborated with Tory Lanez releasing 'Not Today'. Criticism and controversy In mid 2007, Dappy released \\"Love for My Slum\\" with fellow UK rap artist Baker Trouble, which was number one on Channel U (then Channel AKA, now Now 70s) for several weeks and was a big hit in the underground urban scene. However, it didn't do as well with the media and was heavily criticized for a scene in which Dappy is standing outside a block of expensive luxury flats with a \\"rich kid\\" who is trying to look like a gangster. The Independent wrote, \\"His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement ... Do scenes like these suggest that music videos are encouraging their viewers to indulge in criminality?\\". Other papers put that he was \\"idolising thuggery\\". When asked in interviews about the single, following these comments he said \\"these people need to listen to the lyrics, they are about showing appreciation to what you've got\\". Dappy was convicted of battery in 2007. In December 2008, Dappy pleaded guilty to two accounts of assault at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, Essex after reportedly spitting in a girl's face while drunk on a night out. Dappy pleaded guilty to the offences and for each count received four weeks' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, to run concurrently and 100 hours community service. He was also ordered to pay ¬£50 compensation to the girl and her friend and ¬£300 costs. On 12 January 2010, Contostavlos appeared on The Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1 with Fazer and Tulisa. The show received a text message from a woman in Boston, Lincolnshire, complaining that Dappy was \\"vile\\" and \\"a little boy with a silly hat\\" and that N-Dubz were \\"losers\\". Dappy secretly copied her phone number from the studio console and, the following day, tried calling her and sent threatening messages including: \\"Your gonna die. U sent a very bad msg towards Ndubz on The Chris Moyels show yesterday Morning and for that reason u will never be left alone!!! u say sorry I will leave u alone u ****.\\" The woman claimed that she continued to receive messages after declining to apologise, one of which said: \\"u dum f*********head u can call me names over the radio but when I call u direct u chicken out u punk!nana f******niii, Dappy\\").The Guardian wrote that asterisks were presumably added by The Sun, who originally reported the story. Dappy's management later apologised on his behalf and offered free tickets to one of his concerts, but he has not apologised to the woman personally. N-Dubz were subsequently dropped from the Government's anti- bullying \\"R U Cyber Safe?\\" campaign. In January 2013, he was found guilty by a jury at Guildford Crown Court of assault and affray and given a suspended sentence of six months imprisonment. In February 2014, Dappy hit a man in Chelmsford for which, on 19 June 2014, he was convicted of common assault and fined. In September of the same year, he was convicted of an assault in Reading and given a two-month suspended prison sentence. In 2017, Dappy was convicted of possession of a bladed article in a public place following an altercation with his partner and given a suspended prison sentence. Personal life Dappy is cousin to fellow band member Tulisa. He lives in St Albans with his girlfriend, Kaye Vassell, and their two sons, Gino and Milo. Born and raised in Camden Town, North London, Contostavlos grew up with his Greek parents, Byron Contostavlos and Zoi Agorou and older brother Spiros. His father had been a member of the group Mungo Jerry. Byron died on 12 April 2007. His father was from Cyprus, and his mother is from Sparta. Dappy and best friend Fazer started making beats together and coming up with lyrics, later asking Dappy's cousin, Tulisa (who was reluctant at first), to join the band and started to perform in and around Camden Town from the age of thirteen. At the time they were called the Lickle Rinsers Crew and went under the management of Dappy's father Byron, to whom Dappy was the \\"inspiration behind the band\\". Byron worked at a local barbers shop, putting all the money he had into equipment and resources for the band at their studio. However, Byron died on 12 April 2007 after a heart attack and N-Dubz wrote the song \\"Papa (Can You Hear Me?)\\", which was played at his funeral and became the group's second biggest hit at #19, and at #17 in the download charts. Dappy had the words \\"RIP Dad\\" tattooed on his neck and doesn't like to say his dad's name, instead referring to him as \\"B\\" or \\"Uncle B\\", which was also the name of N-Dubz's debut album. Before Byron died, he said he'd like their album to be called Against All Odds but, after his death, the group called their debut album Uncle B in tribute, with their second album being called Against All Odds. He revealed that he is a \\"massive\\" Arsenal fan when N-Dubz appeared on Live from Studio Five, gushing \\"it is an honour to sit next to you\\" to former Arsenal striker Ian Wright who was one of three hosts on the show. In May 2015, Dappy endorsed his manager Archie Lamb's father, Norman, in the Liberal Democrats leadership election.

Development The rigid framed AJS Model 16M 350 cc single was developed in 1945 from the military Matchless G3/L World War II motorcycle. Well proven in war service, the 350 cc single remained in production selling large numbers to the civilian market well into the 1960s. Simple and practical, the Model 16 needed minimal maintenance and was very economical‚Äîideal during petrol rationing. The company also produced an almost identical motorcycle under the Matchless name as the Matchless G3L. The only difference between the two was that the Matchless carried a magneto at the rear of the cylinder barrel, whereas the AJS magneto was at the front. In 1953, the Model 16M was modernised with a dual seat replacing the saddle and rear pillion seat. In 1956 the Burman gearbox was replaced with a new four speed unit of AMC's own design and in 1957 further improvements included replacement of the outdated generator with a crankshaft mounted Lucas alternator. The leaky pressed-steel primary drive cover was replaced with an alloy casing. AJS Model 16MS Neither AJS or Matchless opted for plunger type rear springing, and the Model 16 retained a rigid rear frame until 1949, when pivoted rear suspension controlled by hydraulically dampened spring units designed and made by Matchless became available. The difference was indicated by the S (for springer) designation. AJS Model 16MC The rugged and reliable AJS Model 16 was ideal for the increasingly popular sport of motorcycle trials. Gaining a C (for competition) designation, modifications included upgrading the frame to a welded duplex tubular frame with an engine cradle to reduce weight and redesigned exhaust and footrests to improve ground clearance. In 1957 it was further redesigned to increase clearance from 7 to 10 inches (180 to 250 mm). Hugh Viney led the AJS works team in the post war years and won the challenging 1947 Scottish Six Days Trial on an AJS 16MC at his first attempt‚Äîthen repeated the achievement the following year and made it three in a row in 1949. In the 1950s this record was beaten by another AJS Works Team rider Gordon Jackson, who won the Scottish Trial four times.  AJS Model 16C  In 1964 the AJS Model 16C was launched with a completely redesigned 348 cc engine in which the pushrods were housed in cast cylinder barrel 'tunnels'. The 16C also had a Norton-designed geared oil pump to improve lubrication.  AJS 16 Sceptre  To boost US sales the AMC marketing team rebranded the ageing export Model 16 with the new name The Sceptre with new metal tank badges and steel flywheels instead of the old cast iron ones. The compression ratio was also raised to 9:1 and the competition also Norton designed geared oil pump was also fitted as standard.

His numerous descendants included the Barons Aylmer. Early life He was the younger son of Bartholomew Aylmer of Lyons, Ardclough, County Kildare, and his wife Margaret Cheevers. He married Alison, daughter of Gerald Fitzgerald of Alloone (a cousin of the Knight of Kerry), and his wife Isabel Delafield, the heiress of Culduffe. His sister Anne married Sir Thomas Luttrell, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. In early life he was loyal to Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare when he served as sheriff of Limerick in the earlier 1520s. As a partisan of Kildare, (their factio were the so-called Geraldines) he was made second justice of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) on 19 December 1528. He was confirmed in that role on 23 August 1532, then presented a critique of the Geraldine administration at the English court in 1533, along with John Alan. Just before the rebellion of Silken Thomas, Aylmer was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer on 25 June 1534. When Sir Bartholomew Dillon died unexpectedly after only one year on the bench, Aylmer was named Lord Chief Justice of Ireland on 12 August 1535. Military career Aylmer became a principal agent of Thomas Cromwell in Ireland and worked closely with John Alan, Master of the Rolls in Ireland, in bringing about the defeat of Silken Thomas. He assisted various English lord deputies in Ireland in expeditions against the O'Connors (1537) and the Kavanaghs (1538) and was employed in military campaigns against the Geraldines and the O'Neills. He was knighted in the field after the battle of Bellahoe in 1539, and given a grant of the lands of Dollardstown, near Athy, County Kildare Suppression of the Monasteries Aylmer and John Alan travelled to England in 1536 to receive the bill for suppression of the Irish monasteries, bringing the legislation to the Reformation Parliament of 1536‚Äì7. The resulting Act involved in the first instance the suppression of the monastery of St Wolstan's, near Celbridge, Co Kildare, and assured Aylmer and his fellow chief justice and brother-in-law Thomas Luttrell an annual rent of ¬£4 during the life of Sir Richard Weston, the last prior: in 1538 St. Wolstan's itself was granted to John Alan and his heirs. Aylmer joined with Alan and others in the comprehensive commission to dissolve other Irish monastic houses, gaining profitable estates in County Meath. He conducted an inquisition at Limerick of ecclesiastical shrines in 1541, and he obtained the Franciscan friary at Drogheda by patent of 16 February 1543 for the price of ¬£54 17s. 3d. Despite his loyalty to Henry it is not clear whether he was committed to the Protestant faith: it was not unusual then for members of the Anglo-Irish gentry class to which he belonged to conform to the reformed faith outwardly while remaining secretly loyal to the Roman Catholic church. Later generations of the Aylmer family, including the Barons Aylmer, were mainly Catholic. Opposition to Lord Grey Aylmer opposed the policy of the new Lord Deputy of Ireland, Leonard Grey after Silken Thomas's rebellion was quashed in 1536, and campaigned with John Alen to undermine Grey's administration.Crawford, John G \\"Dictionary of National Biography\\" Aylmer attended Sir Anthony St Leger to London in 1538, joining the commission of inquiry to bring charges against Grey. Three Monarchs Aylmer was knighted in 1539 and survived the downfall of both Grey and Cromwell in 1540 to serve under Henry's successors as King and Queen of England, Edward VI and Elizabeth I, being reappointed Chief Justice on 24 March 1547 and on 16 November 1553. In 1541 he was among the Irish lawyers who petitioned for a lease of Blackfriars monastery in Dublin to establish the predecessor of the King's Inns there.Kenny, Colum: King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland (1992) Later life Aylmer was named Lord Justice of Ireland along with Sir Thomas Cusack on 6 December 1552 and eventually dropped from the Privy Council of Ireland in 1556 when the new viceroy, Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, replaced the appointees of his predecessor St Leger. Aylmer now came infrequently to the Irish council and Elizabeth wrote in 1559 that she wished to promote another Old English lawyer, John Plunket, to the office of Chief Justice in his place. Aylmer family His kinsman and namesake Sir Gerald Aylmer of County Kildare, perhaps a son, was a leader of opposition to the cess ( the tax for the upkeep of military garrisons) among the Pale grandees of the 1580s. His eldest son Bartholomew predeceased him, but left three surviving sons of whom James succeeded to his grandfather's estates, while Christopher founded a junior branch of the family with its seat at Balrath, County Meath, which in time acquired the title Baron Aylmer. Aylmer's descendants resided at Lyons, Ardclough Co Kildare until 1796 when the property passed to the Lord Cloncurry, father of Valentine Lawless (1773‚Äì1853). It later became the homestead of aviation pioneer Tony Ryan (1936‚Äì2007). ReferencesBibliography *Ball F.

Klein became his student for four years and was closely associated with him for another six years.Musical Courier, 15 March 1905, p. 18. Klein called Garcia \\"the greatest singing teacher who ever lived.\\" For their address, see 1881 England Census, available on Ancestry.com. The friendship became a transformative experience for Klein, who would recall Garcia and his singing principles in many of his writings throughout his life. He helped edit Garcia's book on his singing method, published in English in 1872 (later revised by Klein and published as Hints on Singing in 1894). In 1876 Klein took up musical journalism. He began writing for The Examiner in 1879, and then for The Sunday Times (1881‚Äì1901), The Illustrated London News, The Citizen, and the Lady's Pictorial.

ORF X, in yellow, encodes HBx. HBx is a hepatitis B viral protein. It is 154 amino acids long and interferes with transcription, signal transduction, cell cycle progress, protein degradation, apoptosis and chromosomal stability in the host. It forms a heterodimeric complex with its cellular target protein (HBX interacting protein: HBXIP), and this interaction dysregulates centrosome dynamics and mitotic spindle formation. It interacts with DDB1 (Damaged DNA Binding Protein 1) redirecting the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CUL4-DDB1 E3 complexes, which are intimately involved in the intracellular regulation of DNA replication and repair, transcription and signal transduction. Although Protein X is normally absent in the Avihepadnavirus, a vestigial version has been identified in the duck hepatitis virus genome. Although it lacks significant sequence identity with any known vertebrate proteins, it seems likely that it evolved from a DNA glycosylase. Transgenic mice expressing the X protein in liver are more likely than the wild type to develop hepatocellular carcinoma. This is because the X protein promotes cell cycle progression while binding to and inhibiting tumor suppressor protein p53 from performing their role. Experimental observations also suggest that HBx protein increases TERT and telomerase activity, prolonging the lifespan of hepatocytes and contributing to malignant transformation. Molecular effects of HBx HBx causes many cellular alterations. These alterations are due to direct actions of HBx and indirect actions due to large increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) partly induced by HBx. HBx appears to dysregulate a number of cellular pathways. HBx causes dysregulation by binding to genomic DNA, changing expression patterns of miRNAs, affecting histone methyltransferases, binding to SIRT1 protein to activate transcription, and cooperating with histone methylases and demethylases to change cell expression patterns. HBx is partly responsible for the approximate 10,000-fold increase in intracellular ROS upon chronic HBV infection. HBx can localize to the mitochondria where HBx decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential and causes increased release of ROS. In addition, other HBV proteins, HBsAg and HBcAg, also increase ROS through interactions with the endoplasmic reticulum. ROS cause more than 20 types of DNA damage. Oxidative DNA damage is mutagenic. HBx has large effects on the transcription levels of many genes. In a transgenic mouse model expressing the HBx gene of hepatitis B virus (but not other HBV genes), most mice developed hepatic tumors. In these HBx transgenic mice there were 10,553 differentially DNA methylated regions (6,668 hypermethylated and 3,885 hypomethylated regions). In mammalian cells, large clusters of CpG dinucleotides known as CpG islands (CGIs) appear to act as key epigenetic elements regulating gene expression. Hyper-methylation of the CGIs in promoters can silence genes, while hypo-methylation of CGIs within distal exons of genes can also repress transcription of genes. A large proportion of the methylation alterations in the HBx transgenic mice were at CGIs. HBx especially induced hypo-methylation of distal intragenic CGIs required for active expression. There were 647 genes containing intragenic CGIs that were hypo-methylated in HBx transgenic mouse liver. HBx also directly interacts with many genes. Several thousand protein-coding genes appear to have HBx- binding sites. In addition to binding to protein coding genes, HBx bound to the promoters controlling 15 microRNAs and 16 Long non-coding RNAs. For the 15 miRNAs with promoters bound by HBx, expression levels increased for eight, decreased for 5, and did not change significantly for two. Each microRNA with altered level of expression can affect the expression of several hundred messenger RNAs (see microRNA). In addition to its effects on transcription levels of host genes, HBx seams to affect the in-vivo synthesis of pgRNA in HBV replicating cells. As HBx is recruited on cccDNA, it decreases levels of histone acetylation by decreasing recruitment p300 acetylases and increasing recruitment of hSirtl and HDAC1 deacetylases. This, in turn, decreases heterochromatinization of HBV minichromosome, and increases the production of pgRNA. In cells infected by HBx defective mutants, levels of cccDNA remain unchanged, while there is a decrease in pgRNA transcription. Introduction of nucleus localized HBx protein seams to restore viral replication to cells infected by HBx-deficient virus. Relation to PRMT1 In a study purifying cancerous liver cells infected with HBV, the level of expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) was found to be associated with changes in transcription due to the methyltransferase function of PRMT1. Overexpression causes a reduction in the number of HBV genes transcribed, while conversely, underexpression causes an increase. PRMT1 was also found to be recruited by HBV DNA during the replication process to regulate the transcription process. Increased HBx expression in turn leads to an inhibition of PRMT1-mediated protein methylation, benefiting viral replication.

The office building that housed the theatre, the Gaiety Building, has been called the Black Tin Pan Alley for the number of African-American songwriters, who rented office space there. It was designed by Herts & Tallant and owned by George M. Cohan. The theatre introduced revolutionary concepts of a sunken orchestra (the previous configuration had the orchestra on the same level as the seats in front of the stage) and also not having pillars obstructing sight lines for the balcony.Broadway: An Encyclopedia by Ken Bloom - Routledge; 2 edition (November 11, 2003) History The theatre opened on September 4, 1909 with the Fortune Hunter. Its biggest hit during its early years was Lightnin' which played for 1,291 performances starting August 16, 1918. =Minsky's= After 1933, the theatre became a Minsky's Burlesque. One of the top venues in the circuit, it featured performances by Ann Corio and Gypsy Rose Lee, as well as more legitimate fare such as Abbott and Costello. =Victoria= In 1943, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia cracked down on burlesque, and the theatre became the Victoria, which initially featured vaudeville performances including Stepin Fetchit. It was transformed into a movie theatre in September 1943. In 1944 United Artists leased the theatre for movies and in 1949 Edward Durrell Stone designed a renovation of the interior which was expanded to 1,050 seats. A sign on the roof of the theatre went across the neighboring Astor Theatre and was said to be the largest in the world. While originally advertising movies, it would later be best remembered as an advertisement for Budweiser. =Embassy 5= In 1980, the theatre was renamed the Embassy 5, as the fifth theatre owned by the Embassy chain in the Times Square area. In 1982 it was one of five theatres torn down to make way for the New York Marriott Marquis Hotel. Black Tin Pan Alley The office building above the Gaiety was popular among black composers who were not allowed in the Brill Building. Among them were Harry Pace, W.C. Handy, Clarence Williams (musician), Perry Bradford, Bert Williams, and Will Vodery. Andy Razaf would pick up his mail there.

He is a frequent lecturer at international conferences and forums on Jerusalem and has authored six books and many articles on this subject. Overview Amirav is a Professor of Political Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and an expert on the Jerusalem political conflict. During the Six-Day War he served as a paratrooper and was wounded in the battle for Jerusalem on the day Israel captured the Old City, 7 June 1967. In the years 1981-1993, he worked closely with then Mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, in charge of planning and development. In 2001 as advisor to Prime Minister Ehud Barak during the Camp David negotiations, Amirav headed a committee of experts who prepared blueprints for a political settlement in Jerusalem. The model is an open city when the Arab part will be the capital of Palestine and the Jewish part capital of Israel, Temple Mount with no sovereignty. Political activity Amirav was involved in the political arena for many years. In 1987 he was the first to initiate negotiations with the P.L.O. Faisal Husseini, then leader of the Palestinians in Jerusalem with whom he prepared a plan for a confederative political settlement between Jordan, Palestine and Israel. That year, the president of Romania, Ceausescu, invited Shamir and Arafat, to Romania for the first peace conference between the Israelis and Palestinians, on the bases of ‚ÄúThe Amirav Husseini Plan‚Äù. Prime Minister Shamir refused and Husseini was imprisoned. Amirav left the Likud party. His leave certainly had great impact at the time in Israel and abroad. In 1988 he established the ‚ÄúSemitic Confederation Movement‚Äù which included Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians, academics, retired ex-Israeli generals and other public figures. He then initiated the first public peace conference between Israeli and P.L.O. personalities. This took place under the auspices of the Belgium government in Brussels. In 1989 he organized at Stanford University the meeting of top position Israelis and P.L.O. They signed the first peace agreement. Amirav is considered in Israel as the first barrier breaker with the Palestinians. Jerusalem Syndrome Amirav's book, \\"Jerusalem Syndrome: The Palestinian- Israeli Battle for the Holy City\\" was published by Sussex Academic Press in June 2009. The book analyzes how Israel has failed in its attempts to unify the city, and presents the argument that Israel should relinquish its claim on Palestinian neighborhoods and villages incorporated in 1967. Amirav suggests a unique and creative idea for a solution in Jerusalem: The Old City will be considered as a special zone neither Palestinian nor an Israeli sovereignty and will be run by a special regime.

The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and vibratory finishing.Degarmo, pp. 781‚Äì784. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10 minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2 hours for hardened steel. Mass finishing processes can be configured as either batch systems, in which batches of workpieces are added, run, and removed before the next batch is run, or as continuous systems, in which the workpieces enter at one end and leave at the other end in the finished state. They may also be sequenced, which involves running the workpieces through multiple different mass finishing processes; usually, the finish becomes progressively finer. Due to the random action of the processes, mass finishing is as much an art as it is a science.Degarmo, p. 784. TypesTumble finishingVibratory finishing=MediaFunctions of Media= Media are designed for four things: ;Cut: Media which cut can remove burrs and can smooth surfaces. As a carrier of abrasive grain, the large medium pieces effectively increase the impact force of the abrasive on the metal part to be cut, thereby improving the efficiency of the abrasive. Cutting media develop dull, matte surfaces. ;Luster: Some grades of medium are designed to promote luster on the surface of metal parts. These products are generally non-abrasive or have a very low degree of abrasiveness. They deburr by peening, rather than actually removing the burr. Media selection, therefore, will control the degree of surface luster, making the part bright and shiny or developing a very matte, dull surface characterized by a completely random scratch pattern, or anything in between. ;Part separation: A very important function of the medium is to separate parts during the deburring, cutting, surface improving or burnishing operations. The media:parts volume ratio is normally used to control the amount of part-on-part contact which will occur in a vibratory or tumble finishing operation. At low ratios, considerable part-on-part contact occurs, while at higher ratios part-on-part contact is limited. ;Surface scrubbing: Media have the unique ability to scrub surfaces and physically assist compounds in their cleaning function. Both abrasive and non-abrasive media are effective in this. They can remove organic soils, scale, and other inorganic residues. Media come in a wide range of materials in order to fulfill various needs. =Types of Media= ;Aluminum media: Aluminium media are typically cast parts and are available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Aluminum scrubs parts and can work in conjunction with cleaning compounds to clean parts. Since aluminum is fairly nonabrasive it tends to remove surface impurities without affecting the part's surface qualities. Its cost is typically higher than other cast media. Wear rates are lower than ceramic but higher than steel media. ;Preformed ceramic media: Ceramic media are manufactured by mixing clay-like materials and water with abrasives, forming the mud into shapes, drying the shapes, and firing them at high temperatures to vitrify the binder. Many of these binders are porcelain-like in nature. Variability in these products occur both with the type of binder used, firing temperatures, the amount, size and type of abrasive grains they contain, and their uniformity of firing. This type of media today is the general workhorse of mass finishing systems and is the type of medium generally used, because of its availability in a variety of shapes and sizes, low cost, and low wear rate. ;Preformed resin-bonded media: Plastic or resin-bonded media utilize a wider range of abrasive types and sizes than preformed ceramics. The most popular grades are those using quartz as an abrasive. Aluminum oxide, silicon carbide and other abrasives are also used. Usually, low-cost polyester resins are employed as the binder and the various shapes are produced by casting. Resin bonded media is good for preparing a metal surface for plating. ;Steel: Case hardened, stress-relieved steel preformed shapes are available in a variety of sizes and configurations. Balls, balls with flat spots, ovoids (footballs), diagonally cut wire similar to angle-cut cylinders, ball cones and cones (both of which are different from the general concept of cones) and pins are the most commonly used. Steel media weigh approximately 300 pounds per cubic foot and are expensive for initial installation, but, because of their minimal attrition rate and extreme cleanliness, are being more widely used for light deburring applications and cleaning. Compounds are available to keep steel burnishing media clean and bright for extended periods. ;Synthetic random-shaped media: The most popular synthetic random media is fused aluminum oxide, which is available in a number of grades. The more loosely bound, coarse-grained materials are characterized by fast cut and high depreciation rates. Because of the dark color of fused aluminum oxide, the soil generated by this material is excessive in many applications. Fine-grained fused aluminum oxide is generally employed for burnishing and in this respect is unexcelled in many applications with the possible exception of steel. Where some light cutting is required, fine-grained aluminum oxide can develop a better luster on stainless steels and other hard surfaces than can be achieved with steel burnishing media. ;Natural random-shaped media: River rock, granite, quartz, limestone, emery and other naturally occurring abrasive materials are also used in vibratory and tumble finishing applications. In general, these media are not very efficient in vibratory equipment because of their high attrition rates. ;Cobmeal, walnut-shell flour, and related materials: These are used for drying applications because of the natural ability of these materials to absorb water from metal surfaces. These can also be blended with abrasives and used for fine-polishing applications in vibratory, barrel, or spindle finishing equipment. ;Other: Shoe pegs, leather, carpet tacks, and many other solid materials have been used at one time or another in tumble or vibratory finishing for certain applications. Compounds Compounds are added to mass finishing processes to assist in deburring, burnishing, cutting, cleaning, descaling, and inhibiting corrosion. They may be liquids or dry powders. They are usually broken up into four types: deburring and finishing, burnishing, cleaning, and water stabilizing. ;Deburring and finishing: These compounds are mainly designed to suspend the small particles created when deburring and abrading parts. They are also designed to keep workpieces clean and inhibit corrosion. ;Burnishing: Burnishing compounds are designed to enhance brightness and to develop certain colors after mass finishing. ;Cleaning: These compounds are usually dilute acids or soaps designed to remove soil, grease, or oil from the incoming parts. They also provide corrosion resistance for ferrous and non-ferrous parts. ;Water stabilizers: These are used in conjunction with water to maintain a consistent water hardness and level of metal ions. This helps ensure consistent results from batch to batch. ReferencesNotes= \\"Mass Finishing Handbook\\" by LaRoux Gillespie, Society of Manufacturing Engineers, 2007 =Bibliography= *.

In ancient Rome, even Roman men of the highest social status were free to engage prostitutes of either sex without incurring moral disapproval, as long as they demonstrated self-control and moderation in the frequency and enjoyment of sex. At the same time, the prostitutes themselves were considered shameful: most were either slaves or former slaves, or if free by birth relegated to the infames, people utterly lacking in social standing and deprived of most protections accorded to citizens under Roman law, a status they shared with actors and gladiators, all of whom, however, exerted sexual allure. Some large brothels in the 4th century, when Rome was becoming officially Christianized, seem to have been counted as tourist attractions and were possibly state- owned. There were two types of sexual slavery: patronage and prostitution. Prostitutes had to pay a tax, where Patronages did not - however it was deemed more acceptable to be the latter. Satyr and Maenad; Roman fresco from the Casa degli Epigrammi in Pompeii Most prostitutes were slaves or freedwomen, and it is difficult to determine the balance of voluntary to forced prostitution. Because slaves were considered property under Roman law, it was legal for an owner to employ them as prostitutes. The 1st-century historian Valerius Maximus presents a story of complicated sexual psychology in which a freedman had been forced by his owner to prostitute himself during his time as a slave; the freedman kills his own young daughter when she loses her virginity to her tutor.Valerius Maximus 6.1.6 Although rape was a crime in ancient Rome, the law only punished the rape of a slave if it \\"damaged the goods\\", since a slave had no legal standing as a person. The penalty was aimed at providing the owner compensation for the \\"damage\\" of his property. Sometimes the seller of a female slave attached a ne serva clause to the ownership papers to prevent her from being prostituted. The ne serva clause meant that if the new owner or any owner afterwards used the slave as a prostitute she would be free. A law of Augustus allowed that women guilty of adultery could be sentenced to forced prostitution in brothels. The law was abolished in 389. Latin literature makes frequent reference to prostitutes. Historians such as Livy and Tacitus mention prostitutes who had acquired some degree of respectability through patriotic, law-biding, or euergetic behavior. The high-class \\"call girl\\" (meretrix) is a stock character in Plautus's comedies, which were influenced by Greek models. The poems of Catullus, Horace, Ovid, Martial, and Juvenal, as well the Satyricon of Petronius, offer fictional or satiric glimpses of prostitutes. Real-world practices are documented by provisions of Roman law that regulate prostitution, and by inscriptions, especially graffiti from Pompeii. Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum from sites presumed to be brothels has also contributed to scholarly views on prostitution. The prostitutes An erotic scene from a fresco of Pompeii, 1-50 AD, Secret Museum, Naples An erotic scene from a fresco of Pompeii, 50-79 AD A meretrix (plural: meretrices) was registered female prostitute; a higher class‚Äîthe more pejorative scortum could be used for prostitutes of either gender. Unregistered or casual prostitutes fell under the broad category prostibulae, lower class.Adams, J. N., Words for \\"prostitute\\" in Latin, University of Koeln, 1983, pp. 325 - 358 Although both women and men might engage male or female prostitutes, evidence for female prostitution is the more ample. There is some evidence that slave prostitutes could benefit from their labor; in general, slaves could earn their own money by hiring out their skills or taking a profit from conducting their owner's business. A prostitute could be self-employed and rent a room for work. A girl (puella, a term used in poetry as a synonym for \\"girlfriend\\" or meretrix and not necessarily an age designation) might live with a procuress or madame (lena) or even go into business under the management of her mother, though mater might sometimes be a mere euphemism for lena. These arrangements suggest the recourse to prostitution by free-born women in dire financial need, and such prostitutes may have been regarded as of relatively higher repute or social degree. Prostitutes could also work out of a brothel or tavern for a procurer or pimp (leno). Most prostitutes seem to have been slaves or former slaves. The price of a prostitute was a little more than a loaf of bread. In Roman law, the status of meretrices was specifically and closely regulated. They were obliged to register with the aediles, and (from Caligula's day onwards) to pay imperial tax.H. Nettleship/J. E. Sandys eds., A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1894) p. 293 They were regarded as \\"infamous persons\\" and were denied many of the civic rights due to citizens. They could not give evidence in court, and Roman freeborn men were forbidden to marry them. There were, however, degrees of infamia and the consequent loss of privilege attendant on sexual misbehaviour. A convicted adulteress of citizen status who registered herself as a meretrix could thus as least partly mitigate her loss of rights and status.Adams, J. N., Words for \\"prostitute\\" in Latin, University of Koeln, 1983, p. 342 Some professional prostitutes, perhaps to be compared to courtesans, cultivated elite patrons and could become wealthy. The dictator Sulla is supposed to have built his fortune on the wealth left to him by a prostitute in her will. Romans also assumed that actors and dancers were available to provide paid sexual services, and courtesans whose names survive in the historical record are sometimes indistinguishable from actresses and other performers. In the time of Cicero, the courtesan Cytheris was a welcome guest for dinner parties at the highest level of Roman society. Charming, artistic, and educated, such women contributed to a new romantic standard for male-female relationships that Ovid and other Augustan poets articulated in their erotic elegies.R.I. Frank, \\"Augustan Elegy and Catonism,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.30.1 (1982), p. 569. = Clothing and appearance = It was common throughout Rome for prostitutes to dress differently than citizens. At a site near Pompeii, a gold bracelet was found on the body of a thirty-year-old woman inscribed with \\"the master to his very own slave girl.\\" This bracelet is a reminder that not every slave was treated the same. Several paintings in Pompeii show prostitutes completely naked, or sometimes with gold body chains and other expensive jewelry. This gives us a look into the different appearances of prostitutes and sex slaves. From the late Republican or early Imperial era onwards, meretices may have worn the toga when in public, through compulsion or choice. The possible reasons for this remain a subject of modern scholarly speculation. Togas were otherwise the formal attire of citizen men, while respectable adult freeborn women and matrons wore the stola. This crossing of gender boundaries has been interpreted variously. At the very least, the wearing of a toga would have served to set the meretrix apart from respectable women, and suggest her sexual availability; Bright colors \\"Colores meretricii\\" and jewelled anklets also marked them out from respectable women. In Pompeii, there have been artifacts found that may suggest some sexually enslaved peoples may have worn jewelry gifted to them by their masters. Expensive courtesans wore gaudy garments of see-through silk. Some passages in Roman authors seem to indicate that prostitutes displayed themselves in the nude. Nudity was associated with slavery, as an indication that the person was literally stripped of privacy and the ownership of one's own body.Alastair J. L. Blanshard, Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), p. 24. A passage from Seneca describes the condition of the prostitute as a slave for sale: > Naked she stood on the shore, at the pleasure of the purchaser; every part > of her body was examined and felt. Would you hear the result of the sale? > The pirate sold; the pimp bought, that he might employ her as a > prostitute.Seneca, Controv. lib. i, 2. Horace dwells at length on the > inspection of female flesh: \\"The matron has no softer thigh nor has she a > more beautiful leg, though the setting be one of pearls and emeralds (with > all due respect to thy opinion, Cerinthus), the togaed plebeian's is often > the finer, and, in addition, the beauties of figure are not camouflaged; > that which is for sale, if honest, is shown openly, whereas deformity seeks > concealment. It is the custom among kings that, when buying horses, they > inspect them in the open, lest, as is often the case, a beautiful head is > sustained by a tender hoof and the eager purchaser may be seduced by shapely > hocks, a short head, or an arching neck. Are these experts right in this? > Thou canst appraise a figure with the eyes of Lynceus and discover its > beauties; though blinder than Hypoesea herself thou canst see what > deformities there are. Ah, what a leg! What arms! But how thin her buttocks > are, in very truth what a huge nose she has, she's short-waisted, too, and > her feet are out of proportion! Of the matron, except for the face, nothing > is open to your scrutiny unless she is a Catia who has dispensed with her > clothing so that she may be felt all over thoroughly, the rest will be > hidden. But as for the other, no difficulty there! Through the Coan silk it > is as easy for you to see as if she were naked, whether she has an unshapely > leg, whether her foot is ugly; her waist you can examine with your eyes\\" > (Satire I, ii). In the Satyricon, Petronius's narrator relates how he \\"saw some men prowling stealthily between the rows of name-boards and naked prostitutes\\". The satirist Juvenal describes a prostitute as standing naked \\"with gilded nipples\\" at the entrance to her cell.Juvenal, Satire vi, 121 et seq. The adjective nudus, however, can also mean \\"exposed\\" or stripped of one's outer clothing, and the erotic wall paintings of Pompeii and Herculaneum show women presumed to be prostitutes wearing the Roman equivalent of a bra even while actively engaged in sex acts. = Differences between sex slaves and sex workers in ancient Rome = Ancient Roman sex slaves were bought by the wealthy, where sex workers (prostitutes) were men and women often employed by ex-slaves. The sex workers would have lower class patrons, where the upper class, wealthy men could just buy sex slaves. If the prostitutes worked out of a brothel, they rarely left the brothel. Each prostitute was given their own small room (or cell) to go about their business. Here, they would be either completely nude or very scantily clad. Sex slaves, however, had a different life. It is possible some sex slaves had tattoos branding them as such, especially since tattoos were so closely linked to slavery. Tattoos and nudity are common for the lowest rank of slavery, so it is not out of the question to consider that the two may have been inflicted on sex slaves. = Legal rights and restrictions on the lives of prostitutes and pimps = Prostitutes had to be registered and licensed. The Aedile, who registered the prostitutes, was responsible for making sure the brothels were in order. This included overseeing the working hours of the brothel, breaking up any fights, and enforcing dress codes. The Roman baths are thought to be a commonplace for prostitution, and since baths were eventually segregated by gender we can see the potential rise in homosexual prostitution and patronage. Pimps and prostitutes had a lot of restrictions put on them during the Republic and Empire, but by 300 CE, pimps and prostitutes were at the height of the legal restrictions put against them. They were not allowed to run for public office. Some religious festivals, like the Floralia, had a strong presence of prostitutes and sexual imagery, while other cults, festivals, and temples excluded prostitutes altogether. It was important to the Romans to separate what they deemed was acceptable, like chastity and family, and what they deemed deplorable, like lewdness and open sexuality. = Male prostitution in ancient Rome = It's no secret that the Romans opposed Roman citizens being penetrated, which they associated with effeminacy. homosexuality. Cato the Elder was very open about his feelings of sexuality. He, and many other Romans, thought the Greek's idea of a free sexuality was shameful. Cato the Elder didn't want any Roman man to be \\"too feminine\\", as he considered this dishonourable. However it was common for Roman men to engage in sex with males as the active partner. Relations were common in the Roman public baths, as men and women bathed separately. It is probable that male prostitution took place in these Roman bath houses as well. There are multiple Latin terms used for a male prostitute, such as scortum (gender neutral) and exoltus (specific to males over the age of 18). Male prostitutes may have been given a percentage of their earnings, where female prostitutes did not. Graffiti advertisements show evidence of male prostitution in Pompeii.  Regulation  Prostitution was regulated to some extent, not so much for moral reasons as to maximize profit. Prostitutes had to register with the aediles. She gave her correct name, her age, place of birth, and the pseudonym under which she intended practicing her calling.Plautus, Poenulus If the girl was young and apparently respectable, the official sought to influence her to change her mind; failing in this, he issued her a \\"license for debauchery\\" (licentia stupri), ascertained the price she intended exacting for her favors, and entered her name in his roll. Once entered there, the name could never be removed, but must remain for all time, an insurmountable bar to repentance and respectability. Caligula inaugurated a tax upon prostitutes (the vectigal ex capturis), as a state impost: \\"he levied new and hitherto unheard of taxes; a proportion of the fees of prostitutes;‚Äîso much as each earned with one man. A clause was also added to the law directing that women who had practiced prostitutery and men who had practiced procuration should be rated publicly; and furthermore, that marriages should be liable to the rate\\".Suetonius, Calig. xi. Alexander Severus retained this law, but directed that such revenue be used for the upkeep of the public buildings, that it might not contaminate the state treasure.Lamprid. Alex. Severus, chap. 24. This infamous tax was not abolished until the time of Theodosius I, but the real credit is due to a wealthy patrician named Florentius, who strongly censured this practice, to the Emperor, and offered his own property to make good the deficit which would appear upon its abrogation.  Brothels  Purpose-built brothels featured cubicles with a permanent foundation for the bed, as in this example from the Lupanar at Pompeii Roman brothels are known from literary sources, regionary lists, and archaeological evidence. A brothel is commonly called a lupanar or lupanarium, from lupa, \\"she-wolf\\", slang for \\"prostitute,\\" or fornix, a general term for a vaulted space or cellar. According to the regionaries for the city of Rome,The two extant regionaries for the city of Rome enumerate landmarks, temples, attractions, public facilities, and private buildings in each of the city's 14 regions in the mid-4th century. See Curiosum Urbis and Notitia Notitia de Regionibus at LacusCurtius by Bill Thayer lupanaria were concentrated in Regio II;Adler, Description of the City of Rome, pp. 144 et seq. the Caelian Hill, the Suburra that bordered the city walls, and the valley between the Caelian and Esquiline Hills. The Great Market (macellum magnum) was in this district, along with many cook-shops, stalls, barber shops, the office of the public executioner, and the barracks for foreign soldiers quartered at Rome. Regio II was one of the busiest and most densely populated quarters in the entire city ‚Äî an ideal location for the brothel owner or pimp. Rent from a brothel was a legitimate source of income.Ulpian, Law as to Female Slaves Making Claim to Heirship. The regular brothels are described as exceedingly dirty, smelling of characteristic odors lingering in poorly ventilated spaces and of the smoke from burning lamps, as noted accusingly by Seneca: \\"you reek still of the soot of the brothel\\".Seneca, Cont. i, 2. See also Horace, Satire i, 2, 30 (\\"on the other hand, another will have none at all except she be standing in the evil-smelling cell\\" of the brothel); Petronius, Satyricon\\" xxii (\\"worn out by all his troubles, Ascyltos commenced to nod, and the maid, whom he had slighted, and, of course, insulted, smeared lamp-black all over his face\\"); Priapeia xiii, 9 (\\"whoever likes may enter here, smeared with the black soot of the brothel\\"). Some brothels aspired to a loftier clientele. Hair dressers were on hand to repair the ravages wrought by frequent amorous conflicts, and water boys (aquarioli) waited by the door with bowls for washing up. The licensed houses seem to have been of two kinds: those owned and managed by a pimp (leno) or madam (lena), and those in which the latter was merely an agent, renting rooms and acting as a supplier for his renters. In the former, the owner kept a secretary, villicus puellarum, or an overseer for the girls. This manager assigned a girl her name, fixed her prices, received the money and provided clothing and other necessities.Seneca, Controv. i, 2: \\"you stood with the prostitutes, you stood decked out to please the public, wearing the costume the pimp had furnished you.\\" It was also the duty of the villicus, or cashier, to keep an account of what each girl earned: \\"give me the brothel-keeper's accounts, the fee will suit\\".Seneca, Controv. lib. i, 2. The mural decoration was also in keeping with the object for which the house was maintained; see erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum. Over the door of each cubicle was a tablet (titulus) upon which was the name of the occupant and her price; the reverse bore the word occupata (\\"occupied, in service, busy\\") and when the inmate was engaged the tablet was turned so that this word was out. PlautusPlautus, Asin. iv, i, 9. speaks of a less pretentious house when he says: \\"let her write on the door that she is occupata\\". The cubicle usually contained a lamp of bronze or, in the lower dens, of clay, a pallet or cot of some sort, over which was spread a blanket or patch-work quilt, this latter being sometimes employed as a curtain. The fees recorded at Pompeii range from 2 to 20 asses per client. By comparison, a legionary earned around 10 asses per day (225 denarii per year), and an as could buy 324 g of bread. Some brothels may have had their own token coin system, called spintria. Because intercourse with a meretrix was almost normative for the adolescent male of the period, and permitted for the married man as long as the prostitute was properly registered, brothels were commonly dispersed around Roman cities, often found between houses of respected families. These included both large brothels and one-room cellae meretriciae, or \\"prostitute's cots\\". Roman authors often made distinctions between \\"good faith\\" meretrices who truly loved their clients, and \\"bad faith\\" prostitutes, who only lured them in for their money.  Other locations  An erotic bed scene from a mural of Pompeii The arches under the circus were a favorite location for prostitutes or potential prostitutes. These arcade dens were called \\"fornices\\", from which derives the English word fornication. The taverns, inns, lodging houses, cook shops, bakeries, spelt-mills and like institutions all played a prominent part in the underworld of Rome. The taverns were generally regarded by the magistrates as brothels and the waitresses were so regarded by the law.Codex Theodos. lx, tit. 7, ed. Ritter; Ulpian liiii, 23, De Ritu Nupt. The poem \\"The Barmaid\\" (\\"Copa\\"), attributed to Virgil, proves that even the proprietress had two strings to her bow, and Horace,Horace, Sat. lib. i, v, 82. in describing his excursion to Brundisium, narrates his experience, or lack of it, with a waitress in an inn. This passage, it should be remarked, is the only one in all his works in which he is absolutely sincere in what he says of women. \\"Here like a triple fool I waited till midnight for a lying jade till sleep overcame me, intent on venery; in that filthy vision the dreams spot my night clothes and my belly, as I lie upon my back.\\" In the Aeserman inscriptionMommsen, Inscr. Regn. Neap. 5078, which is number 7306 in Orelli-Henzen. we have another example of the hospitality of these inns, and a dialogue between the hostess and a transient. The bill for the services of a girl amounted to 8 asses. This inscription is of great interest to the antiquary, and to the archeologist. That bakers were not slow in organizing the grist mills is shown by a passage from Paulus Diaconus:Paulus Diaconus, xiii, 2. \\"as time went on, the owners of these turned the public corn mills into pernicious frauds. For, as the mill stones were fixed in places under ground, they set up booths on either side of these chambers and caused prostitutes to stand for hire in them, so that by these means they deceived very many, some that came for bread, others that hastened thither for the base gratification of their wantonness.\\" From a passage in Festus, it would seem that this was first put into practice in Campania: \\"prostitutes were called 'aelicariae', 'spelt-mill girls, in Campania, being accustomed to ply for gain before the mills of the spelt-millers\\". \\"Common strumpets, bakers' mistresses, refuse the spelt-mill girls,\\" says Plautus.Plautus, i, ii, 54. The Theatre of Pompey features multiple statues of women. Coarelli believed that the statues at Pompey's villa were of famous courtesans, after correlating the named statues with texts featuring named prostitutes. However, some scholars argue that these are actual female artists, such as poets, muses, and heroines. There is not enough evidence in the correlation between the names to suggest they are all prostitutes. Prostitution and religion The Triumph of Flora (ca. 1743), an Italian Baroque interpretation based on Ovid's account of the Floralia, by Giovanni Battista TiepoloOvid, Fasti 4, as discussed by T.P. Wiseman, The Myths of Rome (University of Exeter Press, 2004), pp. 1‚Äì11. Prostitutes had a role in several ancient Roman religious observances, mainly in the month of April. On 1 April, women honored Fortuna Virilis, \\"Masculine Luck\\", on the day of the Veneralia, a festival of Venus. According to Ovid,Ovid, Fasti 4.133‚Äì134. prostitutes joined married women (matronae) in the ritual cleansing and reclothing of the cult statue of Fortuna Virilis. Usually, the line between respectable women and the infames was carefully drawn: when a priestess traveled through the streets, attendants moved prostitutes along with other \\"impurities\\" out of her path. On 23 April, prostitutes made offerings at the Temple of Venus Erycina that had been dedicated on that date in 181 BC, as the second temple in Rome to Venus Erycina (Venus of Eryx), a goddess associated with prostitutes. The date coincided with the Vinalia, a wine festival. \\"Pimped-out boys\\" (pueri lenonii) were celebrated on 25 April, the same day as the Robigalia, an archaic agricultural festival aimed at protecting the grain crops.According to the Fasti Praenestini; Craig A. Williams, Roman Homosexuality (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 32. On 27 April, the Floralia, held in honor of the goddess Flora and first introduced about 238 BC, featured erotic dancing and stripping by women characterized as prostitutes. According to the Christian writer Lactantius, \\"in addition to the freedom of speech that pours forth every obscenity, the prostitutes, at the importunities of the rabble, strip off their clothing and act as mimes in full view of the crowd, and this they continue until full satiety comes to the shameless lookers-on, holding their attention with their wriggling buttocks\\".Lactantius, Instit. Divin. 20.6. Juvenal also refers to the nude dancing, and perhaps to prostitutes fighting in gladiatorial contests.Juvenal, Satire 6.250‚Äì251, as cited by Culham, \\"Women in the Roman Republic,\\" p. 144. Medieval meretrix In Medieval Europe, a meretrix was understood as any woman held in common, who ‚Äúturned no one away‚Äù. It was generally understood that money would be involved in this transaction, but it did not have to be: rather, it was promiscuousness that defined the meretrix. Medieval Christian authors often discouraged prostitution, but did not consider it a serious offence and under some circumstances even considered marrying a harlot to be an act of piety. Every woman was considered to contain a latent meretrix, so that it was possible to both rise out of and fall into the category, as with tales of prostitutes repenting to become saints.Carla Freccero, Queer/Early/Modern (2005) p. 37 Certain modern professors of feminism have argued that a meretrix in the medieval mindset is closer to our modern understanding of a sexual identity or orientation.Martha C.

The service of the F-86L destined to be quite brief, since by the time the last F-86L conversion was delivered, the type was already being phased out in favor of supersonic interceptors. Received new Lockheed F-104A Starfighter interceptor aircraft in early 1958, the third ADC squadron to receive the F-104. In addition, the squadron received the two- seat, dual-control, combat trainer F-104B. The performance of the F-104B was almost identical to that of the F-104A, but the lower internal fuel capacity reduced its effective range considerably. However, the F-104A was not very well suited for service as an interceptor. Its low range was a problem for North American air defense, and its lack of all-weather capability made it incapable of operating in conjunction with the SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) system. Service with the ADC was consequently quite brief, and the F-104As of the 337th were transferred to the Air National Guard. With the transfer of the Starfighters, ADC shut down operations at Westover Air Force Base and the 337th was inactivated in July 1960. =Tactical fighter operations= Reactivated as a McDonnell F-4 Phantom II tactical fighter squadron at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in 1982‚Äì1985. =Flight test operations= The 2874th Test Squadron was activated as a flight test squadron at McClellan Air Force Base, California in January 1988. It conducted flight tests on aircraft returning to active service after depot maintenance, modification, or repair.

The Act applies both to \\"ship & cargo\\" marine insurance, and to P&I; cover. The Act was drafted by Sir Mackenzie Dalzell Chalmers, who had earlier drafted the Sale of Goods Act 1893. The Act is a codifying act, that is to say, it attempts to collate existing common law and present it in a statutory (i.e. ‚Äúcodified‚Äù) form. In the event, the Act did more than merely codify the law, and some new elements were introduced in 1906. The Marine Insurance Act 1906 has been highly influential, as it governs not merely English Law, but it also dominates marine insurance worldwide through its wholesale adoption by other jurisdictions. Two modern statutes, the Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012 (‚ÄúCIDRA‚Äù) and the Insurance Act 2015 have made amendments to the law of insurance. Overview The most important sections of this Act include: :s.4: a policy without insurable interest is void. :s.17: imposes a duty on the insured of uberrimae fides (as opposed to caveat emptor); ie. that questions must be answered honestly and the risk not misrepresented. :s.18: the proposer of the insurer has a duty to disclose all material facts relevant to the acceptance and rating of the risk. Failure to do so is known as non-disclosure or concealment (there are minor differences in the two terms) and renders the insurance voidable by the insurer. :s.33(3): If [a warranty] be not [exactly] complied with, then, subject to any express provision in the policy, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of warranty, but without prejudice to any liability incurred by him before that date. :s.34(2): where a warranty has been broken, it is no defence to the insured that the breach has been remedied, and the warranty complied with, prior to the loss. :s.34(3): a breach of warranty may be waived by the insurer. :s.50: a policy may be assigned. Typically, a shipowner might assign the benefit of a policy to the ship-mortgagor. :ss.60-63: deals with the issues of a constructive total loss. The insured can, by notice, claim for a constructive total loss with the insurer becoming entitled to the ship or cargo if it should later turn up. (By contrast an actual total loss describes the physical destruction of a vessel or cargo.) :s.79: deals with subrogation; ie. the rights of the insurer to stand in the shoes of an indemnified insured and recover salvage for his own benefit. Schedule 1 of the Act contains a list of definitions; schedule 2 contains the model policy wording. Reform Two new statutes, the Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012 (‚ÄúCIDRA‚Äù) and the Insurance Act 2015 have addressed insurance in general, and have amended the law in several ways. Part 5 of the Insurance Act 2015 addresses \\"Good faith\\" as follows: * Section 14 provides that \\"any rule of law permitting a party to a contract of insurance to avoid the contract on the ground that utmost good faith has not been observed by the other party is abolished. * Accordingly, s,14(3) amends s.17 of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 to read: \\"A contract of marine insurance is a contract based upon the utmost good faith\\" and that section's subsequent words: \\"and, if the utmost good faith be not observed by either party, the contract may be avoided by the other party\\" are now omitted.

In November 1989, it signed on the air.Broadcasting Yearbook 1990 page B-302 It was owned by the Breckenridge Broadcasting Company and it aired a country music format. On July 19, 1996, the call letters were changed to KLTP. The call sign was changed to KLTO on August 1, 1998. In 2003, the station was acquired by Tichenor Media, which flipped it to a Spanish language format.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2010 page D-550 Tichenor was later acquired by Univision, the biggest Spanish- language television network in the U.S. The station's city of license was changed to Winnie, serving the Golden Triangle, including Beaumont, Port Arthur and Orange. The dial position switched to 105.3. On November 8, 2004, the call sign was changed to KPTI and the station began simulcasting the rhythmic contemporary format of its sister station KPTY 104.9 FM in Deer Park, Texas. KPTI was re-constructed after being totally destroyed by Hurricane Ike in September 2008. On February 28, 2014, Excel Media purchased KPTY from Univision for $525,000. Excel Media changed the call letters to KXXF on March 21, 2014. Excel was owned by Jim Walton, who launched the station with continuous plays of the Walton & Johnson syndicated wake-up show, which he co- hosted. On April 8, 2014, KXXF ended stunting with Walton & Johnson episodes. It switched to a Texas-focused adult hits format (encompassing country, blues, classic rock and classic hits) and branded as \\"105.3 Free.\\" It continued to carry The Walton & Johnson Show for AM drive time. On August 16, 2017, Jim King (Jim King of the Road) was hired by John Walton to host middays on KXXF. King's show began airing in mid-September, 2017.

It is an indicator of active viral replication; this means the person infected with Hepatitis B can likely transmit the virus on to another person (i.e. the person is infectious).

While both HBeAg and HBcAg are made from the same reading frame (multiple protein products can be produced from the same DNA sequence and when the genes \\"ORF Core\\" and \\"Pre C\\" are translated together, the result is HBeAg), HBeAg is secreted and accumulates in serum as an immunologically distinct soluble antigen. Hence the reason why the presence of both proteins together acts as a marker of viral replication, and why antibodies to these antigens are a marker of declining replication. The presence of HBeAg in the serum of patients can serve as a marker of active replication in chronic hepatitis.  Function  Although the function of HBeAg was not clearly understood, one study demonstrated that it downregulated Toll-like receptor 2 expression on hepatocytes and monocytes leading to a decrease in cytokine expression. HBeAg is dispensable for replication, as mutant viruses with defects in the pre-C region are both infectious and pathogenic.Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. 7th ed. page 2062  See also  *HBcAg *HBsAg References Category:Viral structural proteins Category:Hepatitis B virus ","title":"HBeAg"},{"id":"20938585","text":"Doomsday Book may refer to: * Domesday Book or Doomsday Book, an 11th-century survey of England * Doomsday Book (novel), a 1992 novel by Connie Willis * Doomsday Book (film), a 2012 science-fiction anthology film directed by Kim Jee-woon and Yim Pil-sung See also * Domesday Book (disambiguation) * Doomsday (disambiguation) ","title":"Doomsday Book (disambiguation)"},{"id":"20938607","text":"Lynn is a surname of English, Scottish, or Irish origin.

It is a DNA polymerase that can use either DNA or RNA templates and a ribonuclease H that cuts RNA in the duplex. Both functions are supplied by the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain.  Structure  The hepadnaviral P protein is organized into three domains: an N-terminal domain () covering the terminal and the spacer, an RT domain related to every other RT domain, and a C-terminal domain () regulating the RNase H activity.  Function  In HBV the pgRNA, is translated into the viral polymerase and core proteins, and then encapsidated and reverse transcribed to form a new rcDNA molecule. In this stage, the HBV polymerase has some tasks and functions. The HBV polymerase is a multifunctional enzyme with RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent polymerase and RNase H activities. Furthermore, hepadnavirus polymerases contain a terminal protein (TP) domain that contains a tyrosine residue that serves as a primer for the synthesis of the (-) DNA strand. In reverse transcription steps, existing of HBV core protein dimers is required for packaging of the pgRNA/polymerase complex. Then, after viral polymerase binds to the packaging signal (H…õ) found at the 5‚Ä≤ end of the pgRNA, they are incorporated into the viral capsid. Inside the capsid, the pgRNA undergoes reverse transcription, which is initiated by protein priming at the tyrosine residue of the HBV polymerase. Thus, (-) DNA strand is made. At the same time, degradation of the RNA template is took place by the RNase H activity of the polymerase. A short RNA of about 15‚Äì18 nucleotides at the 5‚Ä≤ end of the pgRNA (including the 5‚Ä≤ DR1 sequence) is not degraded and it is used as primer for (+) DNA strand synthesis. The resulting RC-DNA is partially double stranded. The (-) DNA strand is longer than a genome length, with a covalently bound polymerase and a redundant flap at the 5‚Ä≤ end. However, the (+) DNA strand synthesis is uncompleted by the polymerase, and there is a gap exists down to the 3‚Ä≤ end of the (+) DNA strand.

Written Work  Besides writing articles, Cooper has written several non-fiction books, a novel and one textbook. Stemming from his interest in African-Canadian history, Cooper has written two biographies, one history book for a younger audience, and co-wrote an autobiography. In 1998, he assisted Stanley G. Grizzle with his autobiography My Name's Not George: The Story of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters in Canada. Following this, he wrote two books based on the life of African-Canadian Olympian Ray Lewis: Shadow Running, aimed at adult audiences and chronicling Lewis' trials as a railway porter, and Rapid Ray: The Story of Ray Lewis, which detailed Lewis' lifelong battles with discrimination and racism, and aimed at a younger preteen audience. In 2005, Cooper wrote Season of Rage: Hugh Burnett and the Struggle for Civil Rights. The young readers' history book examined the reality of racial intolerance in southern Ontario, as well as the efforts and input of many civil rights activists. Cooper wrote a textbook on crisis communications, Crisis Communications in Canada: A Practical Approach. The book uses several real and hypothetical case studies to show college communications students how to handle crisis situations (i.e. with the media, public relations, etc.). His first novel for young adults is entitled The Greyhound.

The station was designed by the Midland Railway company architect John Holloway Sanders. The station is to the west of the market town of Market Bosworth. Nowadays it is part of the heritage Battlefield Line Railway, some to the south of the railway's base at Shackerstone. Original station buildings survive on platform 1, used by the private Station Garage. The track in platform one is a siding, used for the storage of wagons and diesel shunters in various states of disrepair. Platform 2 is on the running line and is the only one in use. The signal box also survives, as do several semaphore signals, though this signalling is not in commission thus the station is an unsignalled halt. The waiting room was originally at on the Birmingham Cross- City Line; when this line was electrified between 1991 and 1993, the building was dismantled and reconstructed at Market Bosworth. Volunteers have been slowly restoring the station. The station encountered severe vandalism at Easter 2008 with one building, the Permanent Way hut, completely destroyed by arson. Any windows that were originally intact in the signalbox were smashed. Nonetheless the railway continues to restore the station. In May 2009, a passenger train hauled by LNER Thompson Class B1 No. 61306 halted at the station for the first time in at least ten years to allow passengers to see the progress at the station. On the weekend of 19‚Äì20 March 2011, completion of a foot crossing at the south end of the station enabled it to be opened to the public for the first time. There is a car park in the former goods yard but only very basic facilities for passengers. There is a long term aspiration to restore the passing loop at the station to allow two train operation over the line.

The player deploys wind-up toys to get them across an arena while attempting to prevent toys from crossing from the other side. Players can play against the computer or another player. Single, customisable games can be played, or the player can play a series of games with set rules and a limited number of lives in a tournament. The game was designed by Eric Zimmerman and Frank Lantz, and developed in eighteen months. A major part of the game's design was the toys' interaction with each other, and the effectiveness of certain toy setups led Zimmerman and Lantz to coin a term for them. Critical reception was mixed, with some reviewers praising its addictiveness and others criticising its sounds and artificial intelligence.  Gameplay  A typical game in the factory in progress. At the top and bottom are stoppers. At the centre are teleporters. There is a powerup key at the bottom-right. A strategy video game, Gearheads is played by releasing toys on an arena floor. The goal is to get them to the other side, and prevent the opponent's toys from reaching the player's side.Manual, p. 5. In single-player mode, the player always plays on the right-hand side. Toys are charged while waiting before they are released. They stop when they run out of energy.Manual, p. 6. There are different types of toys, such as robots, Father Christmas, and magicians. Each toy has its own specifications. These include speed, movement pattern (straight, diagonal, or erratic) and special abilities. For example, the Walking Timebomb explodes when it runs out of energy, destroying nearby toys.Manual, pp. 8,9. Deadhead, a skull toy, \\"scares\\" toys it comes into contact with so they reverse direction.Manual, p. 7.Manual, pp. 7‚Äì9. A chicken toy called Clucketta has the ability to hatch fry toys. Some toys are primarily intended for offence, others for defence. Some are immune to the special abilities of other toys: for example, Big Al (a bulldozer) is unaffected by attacks from Disasteroids (a robot that can also destroy toys, like the Walking Timebomb). The player can switch between the available toys at any time. Once released, players have no direct control over them, and they do not belong to a player: a toy leaving the arena via the left side scores a point for the player on the right side and vice versa. The first player to score 21 points wins, unless he is only ahead by one point, in which case the game continues until there is a two-point difference. There is an unlimited supply of toys, and they are released in a row in the arena.Manual, pp. 6,10. Toys can be recharged by Handy, a glove toy.Manual, pp. 7,8. There are four main arenas: kitchen, garden, frozen pond, and factory.Manual, pp. 9,10. The kitchen has no obstacles.Manual, p. 9. The garden's main obstacles are bugs, mud, and rocks.Manual, p. 10. The frozen pond's main obstacles are cracks in the ice which, if crossed over enough times, become holes that destroy toys that fall into them. The factory levels can feature obstacles such as conveyor belts, teleporters, and stoppers. Occasionally, a Powerup Key (a metal winding key) will appear on one side of the arena. When crossed, a power-up is granted to the player on the opposite side. Powerups include a one-shot rocket, being able to release toys from halfway across the arena, and the opponent being unable to release toys. Most powerups last only for a limited time. There are two game modes: tournament and duel. In tournament, the player is assigned a selection of four toys (toy selections are referred to as \\"toyboxes\\"Manual, pp. 6,11.) and must defeat the computer-controlled opponent. Every three victories, there is a challenge in a special arena where the player must defeat the opponent with only one toy in the toybox. A life is granted if won (the player starts with three). Duel is where players can practise a game against either a computer opponent or another player. The arena where the game takes place, the toys in the players' toyboxes, the difficulty level, and whether powerups are available can be customised.  Development  Frank Lantz and Eric Zimmerman at R/GA Interactive designed Gearheads;Manual, p. 63. it was produced in co-operation with Philips Media. Susan Brand Studios handled art and animation. Other companies involved in the development included R/GA Interactive's parent company R/GA Digital Studios, XXCAL, and Elias Associates. The Windows and Mac OS versions were released in June 1996. A Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) version was developed and scheduled for late 1996, but never released. The game took 18 months to develop. Early in the design process, the designers were able to create new toys and tweak their attributes using a playable prototype. The prototype had menus that showed the statistics for each toy. Alterations took effect immediately, allowing the designers to see what effect a change would have even during a game. There was an iterative game testing process that assisted in balancing the game. An important aspect of the game's design was the interaction between the toys. Due to the discovery of effective toy combinations, Zimmerman and Lantz coined the term \\"engine\\" to describe them. The engines were given names including Punching Roaches, Bomb Shield, and Perpetual Motion. Toy attributes were set to make certain engines possible, although most were discovered as development progressed. The artificial intelligence (AI) included engine-based heuristics so the AI was aware of advantageous combinations. Engines were not written into the game's rules, but were playing patterns that arose from the attributes that defined the toys. During the testing, Zimmerman and Lantz kept increasing the difficulty so the game would challenge them, and at one point made the game too difficult. Reception Gearheads received mixed reviews. Reviewers praised the game's addictiveness, visuals, and entertainment value, but were conflicted over the sound and music. PC Zone lauded the game's addictiveness, saying it features the planning aspects of Tetris and plenty of options, including \\"bizarre\\" powerups. Another reviewer who found the game addictive wrote in Computer Gaming World that this was due to its \\"eclectic cast of characters\\". Michael Bertrand of Gamer's Zone also agreed the game was addictive. Steve Wartofsky of Computer Games Strategy Plus said that Gearheads is just what it claims to be: \\"a furious war of wind-up toys\\". Computer Gaming World agreed with this view of its entertainment value, describing the game as \\"hilarious and addictive\\". PC Teams reviewers called the game \\"great fun\\", and liked the gameplay's facility. These sentiments were echoed by Garrett Rowe of The Irish Times, who said the multiplayer mode's fun factor was \\"endless and chaotic\\". Critics thought highly of the graphics. PC Gamers Dean Evans believed they were \\"pretty\\". This sentiment was echoed by other reviewers including Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly, and PC Team reviewers, who said the game was \\"cute and well done\\". Similar views were held by Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground, who described the game as \\"sweet as honey\\" and praised the toys' animations. Other compliments included Lucas's approval of the music as \\"perfectly suited\\" to the action, and the sound as \\"truly wonderful\\". He said he was \\"immensely\\" impressed by the game. Garrett Rowe of The Irish Times described Gearheads as \\"unusual and original\\"; he also felt the game was \\"refreshingly different\\" from cloned games. Joysticks reviewers believed that Gearheadss concept was attractive to beginners. Criticisms included those of Mike McGrath of Coming Soon Magazine who commented that the game is \\"far too mindless\\", describing the sound and music as \\"annoying\\". Michael Bertrand of Gamer's Zone also criticised the sound and music as \\"repetitive\\", and disliked that the game only has four arenas. PC Gamers Dean Evans believed that Gearheads has a \\"childish\\" nature and is \\"dull and overpriced\\". Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weeklys criticism was the difficulty of controlling the game with a keyboard due to the speed of the action. Another complaint came from GamePros Air Hendrix who criticised the artificial intelligence as \\"moronic\\". The concept was found to be uninteresting for hardcore gamers by Joysticks reviewers, and one was not optimistic about the game's life span. G√©n√©ration 4 cited the inability to increase the size of the game board as a fault. Hendrix of GamePro reviewed the SNES version and said the graphics were colourful and humorous. It was criticised by Electronic Gaming Monthly for having a \\"Lack of strategic depth\\".

The album consists entirely of Tomita's arrangements of Claude Debussy's \\"tone paintings\\", performed by Tomita on a Moog synthesizer and a Mellotron. It entered the top 50 charts in the United States, where it was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 1975, including best classical album of the year, and it was NARM's best-selling classical album of the year. In Canada, it reached #57 in the RPM Magazine Top Albums chart. Overview The use of the term tone paintings here describes the nature of a large portion of Debussy's work which was concerned with mood and colour, eschewing traditional tonality in favour of constructions such as the full-tonal scale, parallel chords, bitonality, and to a certain extent atonality, in order to achieve a greater degree of musical expression not allowed by strict adherence to a single key. Thus, the term tone painting is quite appropriate, in that Debussy's compositions often experimented with a much broader palette of tones, allowing each to behave similar to a colour within an illustration. The album is considered an early example of proto-synthpop. It sparked a \\"revolution in synthesizer programming\\" which it was responsible for taking to new heights. The album's contributions to electronic music included an ambience resembling a symphony orchestra, the use of reverberation, the use of phasing and flanging to create a spatial audio effect with stereo speakers, electronic surround sound using four speakers, realistic string simulations, portamento whistles, and abstract bell-like sounds created using ring modulation. A particularly significant achievement was its polyphonic sound, which was created without the use of any polyphonic synthesizers (which were not yet commercially released). Isao TomitaOral HistoriesNAMM.org Tomita created the album's polyphonic sounds by recording selections one part at a time, taking 14 months to produce the album. The modular human whistle sounds used would also be copied in the presets of later electronic instruments. The track \\"Arabesque No. 1\\" was used from 1976 to 2011 as the theme music for the PBS astronomy-based program Jack Horkheimer: Star Hustler (later Jack Horkheimer: Star Gazer); however, its use as the theme was discontinued when the show was revamped as Star Gazers.

The falls are located within Firehole Canyon on Firehole Canyon Drive, a one-way road that parallels the main Madison Junction to Old Faithful road. History Lt. Gustavus C.

Doane upon the so-called Yellowstone > Expedition of 1870, presented to the Secretary of War, February 1871 Although the falls were commented on in the Washburn and Hayden explorations, there is no historical record as to how they got their name. By the mid-1880s, they were routinely referred to as Firehole Falls in both government and commercial accounts of the park. Barrier to fish migration When the Washburn party traveled through the Firehole River geyser basins in 1870, the river above Firehole Falls was barren of fish, the falls being a natural barrier to upstream migration. Unlike the Yellowstone River drainage, the upper Firehole was isolated from any connection to drainages on the Pacific slope. The absence of fish was overcome in 1889 when the first brook trout were introduced into the river above the falls. In 1890 brown trout were introduced into Nez Perce creek a Firehole tributary and in the 1920s, rainbow trout were introduced into the river. Today, the falls still block upstream migrations of spawning trout from the Madison River, but the upper Firehole has become a world class trout fishery because of these introductions.

Following Graham's death, she married Eugene Gifford and they had one child, James. Crimes Gifford was renowned in her community for her cooking skills and caring for sick neighbors and relatives, and five people died in her care, prompting a grand jury investigation. In 1928, Gifford was arrested at Eureka, MissouriSt. Louis Post Dispatch and charged with three murders. Following the exhumation and post-mortem exams of Edward Brinley and Elmer and Lloyd Schamel, the bodies were found to contain large amounts of arsenic. Gifford was put on trial for their murders in Union, Missouri. Following the three-day trial, she was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to the Missouri State Hospital #4 (a psychiatric institution) as quoted on Rootsweb where she remained until her death in 1951. Gifford acted the role of nurse for her sick neighbors, and a total of 17 people died in her care. It wasn't until after the grand jury investigation of the five deaths that suspicions were raised about an additional 12 deaths.

Structure of Influenza, showing neuraminidase marked as NA and hemagglutinin as HA Influenza virus replication, showing how in step 6 the neuraminidase and hemagglutinin proteins incorporated into the host cell's membrane are used to escape. Viral neuraminidase is a type of neuraminidase found on the surface of influenza viruses that enables the virus to be released from the host cell. Neuraminidases are enzymes that cleave sialic acid groups from glycoproteins and are required for influenza virus replication. Viral neuraminidases are the members of the Glycoside hydrolase family 34 CAZY GH_34 which comprises enzymes with only one known activity; sialidase or neuraminidase . Neuraminidases cleave the terminal sialic acid residues from carbohydrate chains in glycoproteins. Sialic acid is a negatively charged sugar associated with the protein and lipid portions of lipoproteins. In Influenza virus, neuraminidases prevent self-aggregation by removing the carbohydrate from the viral envelope thus facilitating the mobility of the virus to and from the site of infection. Antiviral agents that inhibit influenza viral neuraminidase activity are of major importance in the control of influenza. When influenza virus replicates, it attaches to the interior cell surface using hemagglutinin, a molecule found on the surface of the virus that binds to sialic acid groups. Sialic acids are found on various glycoproteins at the host cell surface, and the virus exploits these groups to bind the host cell. In order for the virus to be released from the cell, neuraminidase must enzymatically cleave the sialic acid groups from host glycoproteins. Since the cleavage of the sialic groups is an integral part of influenza replication, blocking the function of neuraminidase with neuraminidase inhibitors is an effective way to treat influenza. A single hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein can combine neuraminidase and hemagglutinin functions, such as in mumps virus and human parainfluenza virus. Function The enzyme helps viruses to be released after budding from the plasma membrane of a host cell. Influenza virus membranes contain two glycoproteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. While the hemagglutinin on the surface of the virion is needed for infection, its presence inhibits release of the particle after budding. Viral neuraminidase cleaves terminal neuraminic acid (also called sialic acid) residues from glycan structures on the surface of the infected cell. This promotes the release of progeny viruses and the spread of the virus from the host cell to uninfected surrounding cells. Neuraminidase also cleaves sialic acid residues from viral proteins, preventing aggregation of viruses. Inhibitors Neuraminidase has been targeted in structure-based enzyme inhibitor design programmes that have resulted in the production of two drugs, zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Administration of neuraminidase inhibitors is a treatment that limits the severity and spread of viral infections. Neuraminidase inhibitors are useful for combating influenza infection: zanamivir, administered by inhalation; oseltamivir, administered orally; and under research is peramivir administered parenterally, that is through intravenous or intramuscular injection. =Neuraminidase inhibition resistance= On February 27, 2005, a 14-year-old Vietnamese girl was documented to be carrying an H5N1 influenza virus strain that was resistant to the drug oseltamivir. The drug is used to treat patients that have contracted influenza. However, the Vietnamese girl who had received a prophylactic dose (75 mg once a day) was found to be non-responsive to the medication. In growing fears of a global avian flu pandemic, scientists began to look for a cause of resistance to the Tamiflu medication. The cause was determined to be a histidine-to-tyrosine (amino acid) substitution at position 274 in its neuraminidase protein. As strains of influenza are continuously mutating, it is essential that scientists quickly and efficiently determine the correct neuraminidase subtype that is responsible for the drug resistance in order to develop medications that will combat specific strains of influenza. A new class of neuraminidase inhibitors that covalently attach to the enzyme have shown activity against drug-resistant virus in vitro.BBC News: Flu drug 'shows promise' in overcoming resistance (accessed 22 February 2013)Kim J-H et al.

Science Specificity In ideal circumstances, influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) should act on the same type of receptor the virus hemagglutinin (HA) binds to, a phenomenon that does not always happen. It is not quite clear how the virus manages to function when there is no close match between the specificities of NA and HA. Exo- and endo- Neuraminidase enzymes can have endo- or exo-glycosidase activity, and are classified as EC 3.2.1.29 (endo-neuraminidase) and EC 3.2.1.18 (exo-neuraminidases). In general, mammalian sialic acid residues are at terminal positions (non- reducing end) in complex glycans, and so viral neuraminidases - which are exo- glycosidase enzymes - use these terminal residues as their substrates.

New York: Ticknor & Fields, 1992. 195-196 Its proximity to the capital combined with its heavy forests, mountainous terrain and difficult weather made it ideal for guerilla operations. The state's population was largely sympathetic to the Republican cause and the region was laced with routes for smuggling arms and supplies for Republican forces operating in the area. Maximilian found it unacceptable that Republican troops were operating so close to the capital without opposition. He found it important both strategically and politically that his forces quell Republican activity in Michoac√°n to prevent the destabilization of his regime.Maximilian and Ju√°rez.

(1996). Modern Mongolia: A Concise History. Offset Printing, Mongolian Center for Scientific and Technological Information was a central figure in Mongolia's early revolutionary movement. He was a founding member of the Mongolian People's Party (later renamed the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party or MPRP) in 1919 and later served as chairman of the Party Central Committee in 1921. Danzan orchestrated the purge and execution of Mongolia's first prime minister, Dogsomyn Bodoo in 1922, but then was himself purged and executed in 1924. Early life and revolution Danzan was born in T√ºsheet Khan Province in 1885. As a young man he made his living as a horse thief. Later he went on to work in Niislel Kh√ºree (present day Ulaanbaatar) as a customs official in the Ministry of Finance. In 1919 Danzan, Dansrabilegiin Dogsom, and Damdin S√ºkhbaatar together established the clandestine nationalist group Z√º√ºn Kh√ºree (East Kh√ºree) after General Xu Shuzheng's forces entered Niislel Kh√ºree to re-assert Chinese sovereignty. Z√º√ºn Kh√ºree subsequently merged with the Konsulyn Denj group to form the MPRP in 1919, making Danzan one of the seven founders of the MPRP. In July 1919 Danzan and Khorloogiin Choibalsan traveled to Verkhneudinsk, the capital of the pro-Soviet Far Eastern Republic, in the first part of July where they met with Boris Shumyatsky, then acting head of the government. For three weeks Shumyatsky dodged their demands for a speedy Soviet decision whether or not to provide military assistance to the Mongolians against the Chinese. Danzan, Darizavyn Losol, and L. Dendev traveled to Omsk in August and then onto Moscow in September 1919 to further consult with Soviet authorities. At first the Soviets were hesitant to provide the Mongolian revolutionaries with assistance for fear of unnecessarily antagonizing the Chinese. However, with the expulsion of Chinese troops from Niislel Kh√ºree by the anti-Soviet Russian warlord Baron von Ungern-Sternberg in February 1921, the Soviets backed the MPRP. At the Soviet-organized first congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party was held secretly in Kyakhta between March 1‚Äì3, 1921, Danzan was elected chairman of the party's central committee. On 28 June, the main Soviet expeditionary corps along with a group of Mongolian partisans crossed the border into Mongolia, and on 6 July, the first Mongolian and Russian units entered Niislel Kh√ºree. Purge of Bodoo Within two months of the Mongolian Revolution and the establishment of the revolutionary government in July 1921, Danzan lost his seat as party leader to Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj, a relative of Prime Minister Dogsomyn Bodoo. The move intensified the political rivalry between Bodoo and Danzan who, as Minister of Finance, engineered various plots to remove the Prime Minister from office.Baabar 1999, pg. 229-230 He exploited the angry public backlash to Bodoo's unpopular campaign (initially instigated by the Soviets) to \\"modernize\\" the people by forcibly cutting off ‚Äúfeudal‚Äù ornaments from Mongolian deels such as large cuffs, women‚Äôs jewelry, and even long hair.Baabar 1999, p. 231 Danzan also accused the Prime Minister of plotting with the independence leader Ja Lama and with the Chinese and Americans to undermine the revolution and establish an autocratic government. Even after Bodoo resigned from all of his positions within the government for health reasons on January 7, 1922 Danzan pursued charges against him until he was convicted of counterrevolution. Bodoo was executed by shooting on August 31, 1922.Sanders 1996, p. 27 Political rivalries Mongolian revolutionaries; Back row from left:?,?, Rinchingiin Elbegdorj, Soliin Danzan, Damdin S√ºkhbaatar, Ajvaagiin Danzan, Shumyatsky, ?, Dogsomyn Bodoo Political infighting continued within the party and a rivalry developed between Danzan and Rinchingiin Elbegdorj, leader of the leftists and chief adviser to the Comintern in Ulaanbaatar. After he was elected member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the MPRP in February 1923, Danzan angered Elbegdorj and the Comintern by seeking to reduce the number of Soviet advisers in Mongolia, attempting to bring the radicalized Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League (MRYL) under party control, and resisting Soviet advice that Mongolia bypass capitalism and move directly to socialism. Danzan had a head for business and supported the introduction of limited capitalism into Mongolia's economic development. At one point he represented the American-Mongolian automobile company in Kh√ºree and had been given a Harley- Davidson motorcycle by the American businessman W. Holman.Addleton, Jonathan. (2013). Mongolia and the United States: A Diplomatic History Hong Kong University Press The conflict came to a head at the Third Party Congress in August 1924. Rinchingiin Elbegdorj and Dambadorj (head of the right-wing faction) both accused Danzan of representing bourgeois interests and engaging in business with American and Chinese firms. Danzan and Bavaasan, head of the Revolutionary Youth league, were arrested together with several other delegates, quickly put on trial, sentenced to death, and shot: all within a period of 24 hours while the party congress continued to meet.C.R. Bawden, The Modern History of Mongolia, London 1968, p. 276-282 Nevertheless, the swiftness of Danzan's execution sent a shock wave through the party that consolidated the Soviet stranglehold on Mongolia.Sandag, Shagdariin; Kendall, Harry (1999). Poisoned Arrows: The Stalin-Choibalsan Mongolian Massacres, 1921-1941.

BiographyEarly life= Fitial, who is nicknamed Josie, was born Josepina Padiermos, in 1962 in Gapan, Nueva Ecija, the Philippines. She was the oldest child of four children of a poor family. She earned her bachelor‚Äôs degree in business administration from the University of the East in Manila. Padiermos moved to the Northern Mariana Islands in 1983 to financially support her family in the Philippines. There she met her future husband, Benigno Fitial, a politician, while working as a waitress on Saipan. The couple later married and had two children, Patrick and Christina, in addition to Benigno Fitial's four children from a previous marriage, Jason, Cathy, Junella and Julie. First Lady of the Northern Mariana Islands Benigno Fitial would later serve as the Speaker of the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives and the Governor of the CNMI beginning in 2006. Josie Fitial became First Lady of the Northern Mariana Islands when her husband took office on January 9, 2006. Fitial has placed emphasis on programs and initiatives relating to education, health care, recycling and the environment, as well as children, students and the elderly. She has been named an honorary goodwill ambassador of the Red Cross, CNMI Chapter, and is a former member of the CNMI Lions Clubs International. Fitial has established the Vision Foundation, which promotes charitable causes within the Northern Mariana Islands. A focus of Fitial's foundation has been the donations of books and other literature to CNMI public schools. Among Fitial's contributions through her organization has been the contribution of more than 500 books to the Dandan Elementary School and Japanese-language books to Saipan-Marianas High School. Fitial has also used money raised to fund senior citizen and children's programs, as well as beautification programs within the CNMI. Additionally, Fitial has pushed recycling programs, as waste disposal is a major problem afflicting the CNMI. She has also promoted the role of the Filipino community within the Northern Mariana Islands as First Lady. On November 12, 2008, Fitial issued a letter to the First Lady of the United States Laura Bush. In her letter, Fitial appealed to Bush to ask President George W. Bush and the federal government to halt the designation of the proposed Marianas Trench Marine National Monument in the Northern Mariana Islands. The designation was opposed by Fitial, the government of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Carolinian Affairs Advisory Committee and the Guam Legislature. All feared harm to the local economy and cultural practices if the national monument was created. In her letter, Fitial wrote that the monument designation was avoidable and appealed to Bush, \\"We are simple Americans, a globally responsible Commonwealth of the U.S. We honor and uphold a long tradition of coexistence with Mother Ocean. Island heritage passed down from our elders teaches us that we and nature are one.\\" Despite the appeals, President Bush created the national monument on January 6, 2009. Both First Lady Fitial and the Governor were present for the ceremony. In a 2009 interview with the Marianas Variety, Fitial noted that she had risen from an immigrant and waitress to having now met three U.S. Presidents - George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

History The company was founded in 1998 by Jonathan Milner with co- founders professor Tony Kouzarides and David Cleevely, with the idea of making it easier for research scientists to buy antibodies across the web. Milner was a postdoctoral researcher studying the newly discovered breast cancer protein BRCA2 in Kouzarides' Cambridge University laboratory. The project had slowed because of problems finding quality antibody reagents that had honest and up- to-date information about their uses and limitations. This scenario provided the motivation to form an on-line service that would help themselves and researchers across the globe. Since its inception in 1998, the company has diversified from carrying only antibodies. It supplies antibody related products such as immunoassays (e.g. SimpleStep ELISA Kits), peptides, proteins and protein detection products (e.g. immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining kits). Abcam also has a portfolio of non-antibody related products such as biochemicals, cellular assays, and epigenetics kits (e.g. FirePlex Multiplex miRNA Kits). Abcam is listed on the London Stock Exchange. Acquisitions In May 2011, Abcam announced the acquisition of MitoSciences, a privately held biotech company based in Eugene, Oregon (US).

Development P-40 radar of Serbian Army 250th Air Defense Missile Brigade. The P-40 started development in 1960 and by 1962 the radar had completed state trials and in 1963 was accepted into service by the anti- aircraft troops of the Soviet armed forces. In 1965 the P-40 gained the GRAU designation 1S12 as it was adopted as the target acquisition radar of the 2K11 Krug mobile anti-aircraft defence system. The main difference between P-40 and 1S12 is the additional \\"Telecode system\\" 1S62, with an telescope antenna at front right of chassis, to share data between 1S12 and 1S32. The P-40 was developed by Scientific Research Institute #208 GKRE, which later became known as NIIIP of Minradioprom, OKB-588 (later Lianozovskiy Electromechanical Plant, LEMZ) also assisted in the production of the prototype. Between the 1966 and 1968 the radar was upgraded, increasing the range of the system. Later, between 1969 and 1970, the radar's range was again improved in addition to achieving better reliability. Description P-40 radar at Nellis AFB The P-40 was the first high-mobility radar to enter into service with the then new tactical anti-aircraft forces of the Soviet armed forces. The P-40 used the AT-T artillery tractor with tracked chassis, fitted with a 12-cylinder 4-stroke diesel engine with an output of 342 kW (465 hp) and producing a top speed of 55 km/h. The P-40 had a crew of 6 and a total weight of 35 tons, the radar being powered by a gas turbine running 400 Hz generator. The radar uses an open frame truncated parabolic antenna with a stacked antenna feed. The radar antenna is mounted on the truck used to transport it giving excellent mobility, the radar capable of being folded for stowage during transit. Azimuth was determined by mechanical scanning while the angle of the target is determined from within which beam of the antenna stack the target is detected, the radar does not carry a secondary antenna for IFF. Operators The P-40 was operated by the Soviet Union from 1963 and though it has since become obsolete it was passed down to successor states after the fall of the Soviet Union.

The land cessions covered most or all of the modern states of New York, Pennsylvania, western Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, Kentucky, northeastern Ohio and extended marginally into northern Tennessee and North Carolina. The lands were bordered to the west by the Algonquin tribal lands of Ohio Country, Cherokee lands to the south, and Creek and other southeastern tribal lands to the southeast. The cessions were accomplished by a series of purchases and treaties between the Indians and Britain, the state or Province of New York, or (later) the United States between 1682 and 1797. Previous to the cessions, by the Nanfan Treaty of 1701, the Iroquois had gifted to the British their lands to the north and west of the Ohio River, part of the lands usurped by conquest in the Beaver Wars of the latter 17th century. During the early 19th century removals of Indians, most of the Oneida, one of the original Five Nations, migrated to Wisconsin. Other Iroquois migrated to Ontario or Oklahoma Indian Territory. As of the 21st century, the Iroquois are confined to 20 settlements and 8 reservations in New York, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Ontario, and Quebec. Iroquois and Delaware lands Before the arrival of the Europeans, the ancestral lands of the Iroquois were the territory of what is today upper New York state. The Delaware were spread out in the Hudson and Delaware River Valleys along the northeastern Atlantic seaboard. During the Beaver Wars of the second half of the 17th century, the Iroquois conquered lands extending as far as the Mississippi River in the west and Tennessee River in the south. The Delaware, under pressure from early European coastal settlements, migrated to the midwest along the Ohio River Valley and eventually settled along the upper Wabash River in Indiana. In 1701, the Six Nations abruptly changed course, and leveraged their newly conquered (or at least claimed) lands to obtain favored treatment and protection from the British at New York. The instrument was called the Nanfan Treaty, in which the Indians ceded most of what would become Ohio Country and Illinois Country along with the future state of Michigan and part of Quebec to the British. The effect of the Nanfan treaty was almost nil, since the resident tribes of the ceded territory, who were not parties to the treaty, were in effective control of the land when the Iroquois withdrew, and the British made no attempt to colonize the area. On the other hand, it didn't cost anything - the Iroquois gifted the land. Treaties and purchases Between 1682 and 1684, William Penn acquired as many as 10 individual deeds from the Delaware for lands in southeast Pennsylvania forming Chester, Philadelphia and Bucks counties. These lands were acquired under the Covenant Chain forged in the early 17th century with the New York Iroquois. Purportedly, in late 1682, William Penn made a treaty with the Delaware under an ancient elm tree, referred to as the Treaty of Shackamaxon. While no firm evidence of such a treaty exists, it's possible that there was such a treaty and that the record of it was destroyed. In 1722, Alexander Spotswood, Lieutenant Governor of Virginia Colony, had arranged the Treaty of Albany with the (then) Five Nations.\\"Treaty of Albany\\" That treaty renewed the Covenant Chain and agreed to recognize the Blue Ridge Mountains as the demarcation between the Virginia Colony and the Five Nations (who that same year became known as the \\"Six Nations\\" with the addition of the Tuscarora). Colonial governments were unable to prevent white settlers from moving beyond the Blue Ridge and into the Shenandoah Valley in the 1730s. When the Haudenosaunee Confederacy objected, they were told that the agreed demarcation was to prevent their trespassing east of the Blue Ridge, but not to prevent the English from expanding west of them. In 1743 the Iroquois skirmished with some Valley settlers. The Iroquois were on the verge of declaring total war on the Virginia Colony when Governor Gooch paid them the sum of 100 pounds sterling for any settled land in the Valley which they claimed. The following year, at the Treaty of Lancaster, the Iroquois sold all their remaining claim to the Shenandoah Valley for 200 pounds in gold and 200 pounds in goods.Joseph Solomon Walton, 1900, Conrad Weiser and the Indian Policy of Colonial Pennsylvania pp. 76-121. At the same time, it was an attempt to make peace between the Iroquois and the southern Catawba.Walton, p. 114 ff. Even so, a difference in interpretation remained. The Virginians believed that the Haudenosaunee Confederacy had relinquished to the Crown any claim they had on all the lands within the 1609 Chartered boundaries of Virginia. They considered these boundaries to extend to the Pacific, or at least up to the Ohio River. The Iroquois understood that they had ceded only their lands up to the Ohio watershed; in other words, only the Shenandoah Valley east of the Allegheny Mountains.Walton, p. 117, 223-224. The negotiations were conducted in the old courthouse, which stood in the center of Lancaster at the time. The Soldiers and Sailors Monument, built in 1874 to commemorate the U.S. Civil War, now stands on the site of the Treaty in Penn Square. This difference was partly resolved at the 1752 Treaty of Logstown, where the Haudenosaunee Confederacy recognised English rights southeast of the Ohio River. Nevertheless, the Cherokee, the Shawnee, and other nations continued to claim by possession large portions of the area beyond the Allegheny Ridge. At the 1758 Treaty of Easton with the Shawnee ending \\"Braddock's War\\" (a portion of the French and Indian Wars), the colonies agreed to settle no further west of the Alleghenies (the Eastern Divide). The Royal Proclamation of 1763 confirmed this territory as Indian land.Jayme A. Sokolow, 2003 The Great Encounter: Native Peoples and European Settlers in the Americas p. 206. By the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768, the Iroquois finally sold all their remaining claims between the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers. Ohio Country After the Nanfan Treaty, small numbers of Iroquois continued to live in Ohio, and broke away from the Six Nations. They later came to be called Mingos.

This particular halt was built later than the rest and was built to serve the then new Cashes Green housing development west of Stroud in response to a public request. The halt was just west of the Cashes Green Road overbridge and consisted of a pair of timber platforms, along with corrugated iron shelters, using materials recovered from the on the Windsor line.

Originally the 'birdcage' (so-called because it consists of metal railings on either side giving the pedestrian the impression that they are actually in a 'birdcage') ended in a foot crossing over the railway approximately 100 yards west of the halt.

Plot The film takes place in the occupied Republic of Czechoslovakia after the assassination of Schutzstaffel-Obergruppenf√ºhrer and General der Polizei Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt, the combined security services of Nazi Germany, and acting Reichsprotektor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In Prague on 27 May 1942. Jirka is a boy whose family was murdered in the village of Lidice as repercussions for the assassination of Heydrich. He stays with his uncle, engineer Petr Lom and Marta, a young girl living next door, who works at the post office to help take care of the boy. Lom has just started working on the military airport, governed by Sudeten-Nazi Ullman. Resistance is quite active in the airport, collecting arms and grenades and communicating with allies. They have a lot of great intel thanks to secretary Jana Tome≈°ov√°, who is Ullman's trustee and has access to a lot of restricted information. Jirka also starts working at the airport, but he is filled with sorrow and in need of revenge. He gets caught stealing a grenade and is arrested by the Gestapo, and later shot. When Jana sees him she faints and Ullman finds a secret message she had with her. He tells his Gestapo friends and goes to the warehouse to investigate where he gets killed by being pushed onto a transformer. The Gestapo start arresting and searching houses of airport workers, revealing that Marta is an informer for the Germans. Lom is not aware of this as he is still struck by Jirka's death. He picks the gun from his hideout and walks back to the airport. After the neighbours tell him the truth about Marta, Lom kills her and helps Jana escape. Germans gather airport workers and threaten to kill them if no one says who killed Ullman. Then Lom appears saying he did it and kills some Gestapo officers, he is killed by the soldiers.

History The school was founded by the World War II German refugee Hans Maeder and his American wife Ruth, who paid $60,000 to acquire the 1,100-plus acres of the former Gilded Age estate of Daniel Rhodes Hanna, son of Mark Hanna. At the time of the Maeders' purchase, the property contained 18 buildings and 2,500 feet (760 m) of frontage on the lake known as Stockbridge Bowl. The property had previously been named Bonnie Brier Farm. The Maeders' purchase occurred shortly after the failure of Liberal Arts, Inc. to establish a Great Books-based college associated with St. John's College, Annapolis, Maryland, on the same site. Only a portion of this extensive, largely forested property, which ranged from the summit of West Stockbridge Mountain to the shore of the Stockbridge Bowl, became the school campus. The Maeders retained title to the remainder of the land at the time of their purchase. Following the school's closure, some of this other property was subdivided for residential development. Program The school was unusual for being racially integrated from its inception, as well as for Maeder's successful efforts to recruit an international student body during a period in which many similar schools were comparatively insular and ethnically exclusive. The school flew the United Nations flag just below the United States flag beginning in 1948, three years after the United Nations came into existence. The credo of the school was finally stated with the opening of the new classroom building in the middle 50s, \\"All Men are created equal in dignity and rights\\",placed at the entrance for all to see. For some years, its curriculum included a junior year abroad, and Stockbridge briefly operated a branch in Corcelles, Bern, Switzerland. Yet despite socialist Maeder's remarkably egalitarian aspirations, a substantial number of enrollees were from wealthy New York area families, and Maeder did a significant amount of student recruitment from an apartment he maintained in midtown Manhattan. Six days per week, students, whose number never exceeded about 200, were required to assemble after breakfast and listen to 20 minutes of recorded music. Selections were mostly European romantic and classical music, chosen by a very limited number of faculty, who provided brief commentary. On Saturdays, selections were chosen by a student, and were typically popular music. For a brief period in the 1970s immediately following Maeder's 1971 retirement, and during the directorship of Thomas Newman, the Berkshire Folk Society performed monthly on winter evenings. During this period, visiting artists included Malcolm Cecil, as well as both Joseph Jarman of the Art Ensemble of Chicago and Richard Abrams, each noted for their early connection with the Chicago- based Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. Throughout the school's history, there were frequent gatherings of the student body modeled on the New England town meeting, during which open discussions were held, and votes taken on matters of interest. The school director held veto power over decisions. Anthropologist Esther Newton attended the school in 1957 and wrote in her memoir about the experience: \\"Stockbridge School was also used as a sort of 'holding tank' for teenagers who, for one reason or another, were living in an unsympathetic environment at home and whose parents could afford to send them away to school. Much of the revenue used to pay for the school came from this source\\". Demise Maeder retired as headmaster of Stockbridge in 1971, and was followed in relatively quick succession by headmasters Thomas Newman and Richard Nurse. The school closed in 1976 largely due to difficult U.S. demographic and economic trends of the era, which resulted in declining enrollment and debt, and the shut-down of many small boarding schools in New England. In the introduction to Gunter Nabel's \\"A Fight For Human Rights - Documents of The Stockbridge School,\\" alumnus Benjamin Barber is quoted as proposing an additional hypothesis for the school's demise: the then-radical ideals upon which the school was founded in the 1940s, notably racially integrated coeducation, had become mainstream by the 1970s. The school had fulfilled its founder's goals, and therefore was no longer needed.http://stockbridgeschool.org/stories/intro.html Stories Page: \\"The School That Was\\" The campus later became the site of the DeSisto School, an unrelated organization, also now defunct.

He directed 32 films between 1939 and 1970. Having created Slovene film classics such as Vesna, Ne ƒçakaj na maj and Our Car, he is also one of the most popular directors of early Slovene cinema in 1950s and the 1960s. Life ƒå√°p was born in ƒåachovice (now in central Czech Republic). As an already established professional, he moved to Ljubljana in 1952, following an invitation by Branimir Tuma, director of Triglav Film. In 1957, he moved to Portoro≈æ, a coastal town in southwestern Slovenia, where he lived until his death. Work Prior to his arrival to Yugoslavia, ƒå√°p was praised as the young star of Czech cinema. During World War II he directed a dozen light romantic dramas and melodramas, among them the internationally acclaimed Nocturnal Butterfly which won a prize at the Venice film festival, and Men Without Wings which won a prize for Best Director in Cannes. His last Czechoslovak film The White Darkness, his personal favorite, put him in conflict with the communist authorities. After the criticism his film received by workers jury at Zl√≠n film festival, ƒå√°p called the jury \\"morons who don't understand [his] films\\". This didn't go well in communist Czechoslovakia and he was banned from directing movies. He fled to West Germany where he directed three films, including All Clues Lead to Berlin which was distributed to many countries. He arrived in Yugoslavia by request of the director of a Slovene film production company Branimir Tuma, to help in the development of the Slovene film industry in the 1950s.Vrdlovec, Zdenko (2013), Zgodovina filma na slovenskem, Ljubljana: UMco. In the 1950s and 1960s ƒåap directed five films for Triglav film and another six co-productions and non-Slovene productions. ƒå√°p's first Yugoslav film, romantic comedy Vesna (1953), had elements of Heimatfilm and pre-World War II Czech and Austrian melodrama, and proved highly successful both artistically and commercially, as did its sequel Ne ƒçakaj na maj (1957). Vesna remains one of the most popular Slovene classics. It took the place of the first commercial film - and the first comedy - in Slovene cinema, and was precisely the urban, modern and technically exquisite film that Triglav film had hoped for when it employed ƒåap. ƒåap's second Slovene film was a war drama Trenutki odloƒçitve (Moments of Decision, 1955) about the urgency of reconciliation between partisans and white guards, a topic with which he produced the first censored film in Slovenia.Stankoviƒá, Peter (2013), ƒåapovi slovenski igrani celoveƒçerci, KINO! 21. During his \\"Yugoslav era\\", ƒåap did not only engage in Slovene productions, but in various other acclaimed productions and co-productions. He directed Am Anfang war es S√ºnde (Sin / Greh, 1954, Saphir Film) and the romantic drama La ragazza della salina (Sand, Love and Salt / Kruh in sol, 1957), which featured Marcello Mastroianni. For Bosna film, he directed a drama about juvenile delinquency Vrata ostaju otvorena (The Door Remains Open, 1959), introducing Milena Draviƒá, one of the leading film stars in Yugoslavia, in her very first film role, and another comedy Sre≈°ƒáemo se veƒçeras (Meet You Tonight, 1962). In 1956 ƒå√°p shot Die Geierwally (The Vulture Wally), based on the novel by Wilhelmine von Hillern, in Germany, while X-25 javlja (\\"X-25 Reports\\", 1960), a World War II spy thriller set in Zagreb, saw extensive international theatrical release as well. However, after his poorly received comedy Na≈° avto (Our Car, 1962), ƒå√°p was unable to find work in Yugoslavia and he turned to direct for television. He was engaged in directing a TV series and two TV films for German and Austrian televisions. In Slovenia where he lived, though, he was only able to participate in one more production, directing a short film Piran (1965). Criticism and reception Contemporary Slovene film criticism widely accepts that the 5 films that Franti≈°ek ƒåap directed in Slovene, Vesna, Trenutki odloƒçitve, Ne ƒçakaj na maj, X 25 Reports and Our Car, introduced a Hollywood type of narrative and cosmopolitan appearance to 1950's Slovene cinema. Though struggling with negative criticism in his own time, today ƒå√°p is praised as a craftsman who helped the undeveloped Slovene and Yugoslav cinema ‚Äì at the time infected with dilettante technical standards, problematic focus on local issues and stiff literary adaptations ‚Äì to rise to the level of an exquisite craft with universal intelligibility. Some critics viewed it as \\"genre cinema\\" ‚Äî as ƒå√°p mostly directed comedies, thrillers, and melodramas ‚Äî though these do not correspond strictly to genre rules. \\"Mainstream cinema\\" is a term that more accurately describes its aim to attract the audience by means of a classical, easily intelligible narrative, and by emphasizing the story and dramatic structure, not so much qualities of cinema as an art form. The negative reviews of ƒå√°p's work occurred mostly during the times of 1960's, 70's and 80's Yugoslavian film criticism. The orthodox communist reviewers saw in it a bourgeois threat to socialist values, and a conservative return to the middle class phantom concepts (e.g. The idea of innocent romantic love). They also minded ƒå√°p's comedies‚Äô prevailing themes of spoiled youth and their sexual awakening in Vesna and Ne ƒçakaj na maj.≈†tefanƒçiƒç, Marcel (2005): Na svoji zemlji. Zgodovina slovenskega filma, Ljubljana: UMco. The name object of early criticism, however, was the misrepresentation (or lack of representation) of Slovene culture in ƒå√°p's cinema, especially in the hugely popular comedies. A number of reviewers saw ƒå√°p as a foreigner who has never assimilated to Slovene culture. They resented that the films were not specific enough and could be set anywhere in Central Europe. These reviews seem traditionalist and xenophobic from contemporary point of view. Contemporary Slovene film theorists have largely praised ƒå√°p's \\"foreignness\\" or \\"otherness\\", reasoning that his ignorance for regional values and conflicts has actually helped him to maintain the necessary objective distance and his particular sense of film direction and storytelling. =ƒå√°p and Slovene language= Contrary to complaints regarding the generic nature of the films, it is well recognized that ƒå√°p contributed drastically to the adaptation of Slovene language for cinematic use. The dialogues were fluent and had substance, there was plenty of wordplays, verbal comedy, urban slang and authentic regional accents. The dialogues from ƒåap's comedies came into general usage and became items of universal joking across generations and nation. Whereas Slovene language in pre-ƒåap cinema hadn't functioned well, ƒå√°p invented a slang liberated from constraints of purism and theatricality. Thus the director, while being attacked for directing un-Slovene films by many reviewers, in fact enriched Slovene language and culture.Kreƒçiƒç, Jela (2013), ‚ÄúVesna in Ne ƒçakaj na maj: kako smo v sivini realsocialistiƒçnega vsakdana pri≈°li do komiƒçnega duha‚Äù, KINO! 21.

It was established in 1877 in a restaurant in Piccadilly Circus, and moved to premises on Adam Street in 1955, where it remained until its closure in 2004. The club's name was not trademarked, and there have been at least two attempts to \\"re-found\\" a version of the club in new premises. History The club was set up by the Victorian actor-manager Sir Henry Irving, and Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort, with the latter agreeing to be its first president. Its inaugural meeting was on 21 July 1877, in the Criterion restaurant, Piccadilly Circus, with those present then walking over to the club's first premises in the Caledonian Hotel at 10 Adelphi Terrace, near Strand. The club was to remain here for the next six years. When the club's lease in the Caledonian Hotel expired in 1883, new premises were bought at 20 Bedford Street (off Strand), with the club temporarily relocating to 22 King Street (near Covent Garden), whilst repairs were carried out. After the Duke of Beaufort's death in 1899, Sir Squire Bancroft took over as club president. It was around this time that the club's membership - now at 400 - realised that they needed a larger set of premises, and so in 1903 the club moved once more, leasing the first floor of 46 Leicester Square from the Automobile Association. The club remained here until it was hit by a Luftwaffe bomb on 16 October 1940. Offered temporary facilities by the Royal Societies Club in St. James's Street, the Green Room took to leasing rooms in Whitcomb Street, in the hope of one day renovating the Leicester Square rooms and moving back there. In the event, this never happened. Instead, on 28 June 1955 it moved to the premises, the basement of 8-9 Adam Street. These rooms were extremely cramped, with members fondly recalling a bar designed for twenty people which often had to accommodate over a hundred. Peter Ustinov once described talking at the club at a Guest Lunch was \\"like addressing sailors in a submarine\\". A feature which many visitors often commented on were the club's small, darkened vaults, its full size Victorian snooker table and its wood panelled library. In 1993 the club opened its doors to evening members paying ¬£10 a year. Its first big influx of members came from the cast of Sunset Boulevard which has recently opened at The Adelphi Theatre. Up until its closure at Adam Street the club had had over 6000 members come through its doors. By 1999, with the club's daytime membership dwindling, it was reported that it was in serious financial trouble, and the club was taken to court by the owner of its premises for failure to pay several months of rent. The club lost the case and moved out to a new premises in the old Mercers Arms building opposite the stage door of the Cambridge Theatre. Two small floors gave the club a home for a year but again when the lease ran out the club dissolved.

It is located on the Horrocks Highway approximately halfway between the towns of Auburn and Rhynie, at the junction of the River Wakefield and Pine Creek. To the east lies the town of Saddleworth and to the south-west lies the town of Balaklava. The town was officially gazetted as Undalya in 1859. Meaning The name Undalya was given by the local Aborigines and means \\"water holes\\", while the surrounding district was known as Kercoonda meaning \\"camp near water\\". In the early years of the village, Aborigines were in great numbers in the district. History and events Recent photo of the Bible Christian Church and School (now a private residence). On one of his expeditions, explorer Edward John Eyre camped at Undalya and commented on the large amount of water in the River Wakefield as well as the availability of the local blue limestone. The most notable feature of Undalya is the local bridge over the River Wakefield. Built in 1855, with various alterations, additions and repairs, the bridge is known locally by three names: Basket Bridge, Cradle Bridge or Coathanger Bridge. It has taken the full force of many floods and at one time was the biggest one- span bridge in South Australia. The bridge was bypassed with a new bridge slightly to the east of it in the 1950s and today only serves the local residents. In 1859, a local farmer sold one quarter of an acre for a Bible Christian Church. The Church was built in 1859 and the next year a school was commenced inside it. Both were open for nearly 100 years. Today the building is part of a private residence. In 1866, with a grant of money and land from another local farmer, the Roman Catholic Church of St. Patrick was built by the Jesuit Fathers of Sevenhill on the hill just south of the village. The church closed in 1915 and was later demolished. A graveyard was attached to the church, and is still operating as a cemetery today. People buried there include Patrick Michael Ryan, who discovered copper at Tiparra in 1861, which was the start of the famous Moonta mine, and the first wife of the father of Auburn poet C.J. Dennis. One of the biggest local industries during the 19th century was that of wool-scouring, or wool-washing in the River Wakefield. One such example is that of George Henry Michell, who moved his family to Undalya in 1870, after living at Cudlee Creek, where he had acquired the art of wool- scouring. He persuaded some local farmers to sell their wool directly to him. The wool was processed in the river and packed off to Adelaide and then shipped to London and auctioned. His operation was hugely successful and in 1896 he was forced to move to Hindmarsh near Adelaide. Today, Michell is a large multi-national company, run by descendants of George Henry Michell. The company's factory is located on Main North Road at Salisbury South. The Michell homestead at Undalya still stands today and is used as an animal shelter. In the mid-to-late 19th century, ancestors of Australian Football Hall of Fame footballer Neil Kerley lived at Undalya. In the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, according to the newspapers of the time, Undalya was a thriving rural village with reports of ploughing matches, horse racing and even a shooting at the local hotel, where the owner shot a customer who, on being refused service, had jumped the counter to serve himself. Today the village is nothing more than a collection of a few houses around a rarely used bridge. Notable former residents include author, illustrator and naturalist, Mervinia Masterman. Governance Undalya is in the District Council of Clare and Gilbert Valleys, the State Electoral District of Frome, and the Australian House of Representatives Division of Grey.

The SNU said that it had liquidated the publication due to financial losses, to the dismay of thousands of readers around the world who did not understand why Britain's oldest Spiritualist newspaper was terminated with almost no notice. In 2011 the paper resumed publication with issue #4067 dated 17 December 2011, after the publisher was purchased by the JV Trust in October of that year.. As at 2019, Psychic News is still being published, but now as a monthly magazine. Topics covered Although the primary focus of the Psychic News was always Spiritualism, and it was strongly associated with the SNU even before that organization acquired ownership of it, it was the policy of PN to cover a wide variety of subjects of interest to its readers. For instance, in November 1947 the paper covered the fact that a committee of Anglican ministers had supported Spiritualism in 1936 and that the report had been suppressed by the Anglican Church. This investigative report by the Psychic News caused the Psychic News itself to become the topic of articles in The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. In the 1950s and 1960s, with the rise of the neopagan religion of Wicca, several articles about Wicca and witchcraft were published in the magazine, including \\"Genuine Witchcraft Is Defended\\" by Robert Cochrane. From that time forward the newspaper dealt with other paranormal, supernatural and New Age topics in addition to spiritualism. Reception The newspaper has been criticized for biased reporting and endorsing fraudulent mediums and psychics as genuine. Early articles by Psychic News had supported the materialization medium Helen Duncan. An article in Psychic News claimed that Uri Geller had utilized psychokinetic power based on an incident with a bracelet; an article in the New Scientist cast doubt on the incident and described Geller's feats as magician's tricks.Gould, Donald.

(Note that agglutination is one of three steps in the more complex process of coagulation.) The process of the RBC's agglutinating is called hemagglutination or haemagglutination. Antibodies and lectins are commonly known hemagglutinins. Types Examples include: * Influenza hemagglutinin * Measles hemagglutinin * Parainfluenza hemagglutinin-neuraminidase * Mumps hemagglutinin-neuraminidase * The PH-E form of phytohaemagglutinin Uses in serology Hemagglutination can be used to identify RBC surface antigens (with known antibodies) or to screen for antibodies (with RBCs with known surface antigens). Using anti-A and anti-B antibodies that bind specifically to either the A or to the B blood group surface antigens on RBCs it is possible to test a small sample of blood and determine the ABO blood group (or blood type) of an individual. The bedside card method of blood grouping relies on visual agglutination to determine an individual's blood group. The card has dried blood group antibody reagents fixed onto its surface and a drop of the individual's blood is placed on each area on the card. The presence or absence of visual agglutination enables a quick and convenient method of determining the ABO and Rhesus status of the individual. Agglutination of red blood cells is used in the Coombs test.

Biography Nezval was born to a locksmith family of Frantisek Nezval and his wife Aloisia. The parents wanted him to become a priest. However he managed to finish a technical college and for some time he earned his living as a building designer. He never attended any school of dramatic art. His enthusiastic passion for theatre brought him to make some acting attempts on the amateurish stage. Later he began to perform in various road show theatre companies. Still later he successively became a stage actor of Intimni Theatre in Prague (1930‚Äì1931), of South Bohemia's Theatre in ƒåesk√© Budejovice (1931‚Äì1932), of Svanda's Theatre in Prague (1932‚Äì1934), of Vlasta Burian's Theatre in Prague (1934‚Äì1935), of National Theatre in Ostrava (1935‚Äì1938), of National Theatre in Brno (1938‚Äì1941), and finally of Vinohrady's Theatre in Prague (1941‚Äì1977). Even after his retirement in 1977 he still from time to time performed on Vinohrady's stage as a guest-actor till his last and final appearance before the public in 1997. Thanks to his impressive masculine stature, handsome face with expressive eyes, along with charming manners heightened by a pleasant and resonant voice he, at first, impersonated various lover characters. As he aged, he began to adapt to more various roles, thus starting his career as a classical actor, appearing subsequently in plays of the Czech national literature and the world literature as well (Tyl, Jirasek, Vrchlicky, Langer, Sramek, Capek, Hasek, Sophocles, Lope de Vega, Moli√®re, Flaubert, Strindberg, Rostand, Schiller, Goldoni, Gorkij, Balzac, Lermontov, Pushkin, Tolstoi, Shakespeare, at al). In July 1937 he married a stage dancer Gertrude Nettel, with whom he lived till her death 57 years later and with whom he had two sons. He had two hobbies which he gave all his free time to. He loved literature and gardening. He began to appear in films in the end of the 1930s. Nezval made his very film debut in a comedy film \\"Jarcin professor\\" distributed in 1937. His performance attracted attention of several leading Czech film directors. This resulted in his appearance in many similar films made in a quick succession. One of his most well known films had become \\"Jan Cimbura\\", ‚Äì film based upon a novel of the very same name of the one of the nineteenth-century Czech literature classics, J.S. Baar. Shortly after the war he appeared in a title role in the film \\"Muzi bez kridel, alias Men without Wings, alias Les Hommes sans ailes\\", which was later honoured by the Golden Palm Award in Cannes Film Festival in 1946. In many films he was a partner of several most famous Czech movie star-actresses of that era. One of them was Mrs.L√≠da Baarov√°. His last film role, shot in his ninetieth year, was a supporting role in a war drama ‚ÄúJe t≈ôeba zab√≠t Sekala, alias Sekal has to die‚Äù. Altogether he appeared in 52 films between 1937 and 1998. He appeared in radio and TV as well. Some of these appearances belonged, however, to the beginning of TV broadcasting (in the early 1950s) in Czechoslovakia, and therefore many of them have not been recorded. Gustav Nezval died on 17 September 1998, two months before his 91st birthday.

A total of 94 students of the primary section of the Krishna English Medium School were burnt to death in their classroom as the thatched roof caught fire on 16 July 2004. The accident was one of the four largest fire accidents and the largest school accident in Tamil Nadu's history, as well as the second largest school fire in India in terms of casualties.(The first being Dabwali fire accident) A committee set up under the retired Judge Sampath found out that the heavy casualties were due to the wrong tactics of the management to admit extra students to a primary school and mislead the authorities about the student- teacher ratio. The Chief Minister who visited the site ordered the withdrawal of the recognition of the three schools, prosecution of the school authorities and the correspondent, and the suspension of the Chief Educational Officer, the District Elementary Educational Officer, and the Assistant Elementary Educational Officer of the Thanjavur school district. A compensation of 1,000,000 was provided to the next of the kin of the deads, 25,000 to the severely injured, and 10,000 to other injured victims from the Chief Minister‚Äôs Public Relief Fund. The district administration arranged another primary school in Natham village and accommodated 46 students under the Educational Guarantee Scheme of the government. The state government constructed a memorial park near Palakarai, Kumbakonam in memory of the lost lives, which opened on 6 June 2010. The government also allotted housing plots to 59 homeless parents of the 89 deceased students. After a long delay, a trial began on 24 September 2012 in the Thanjavur district court. The case had 21 accused and had 488 witnesses that included 18 children who survived the accident. The headmaster Prabharan and three others were charged in the case. Charges were also filed against 17 others, including Pulavar Palanichamy, his wife and correspondent of the school Saraswati, three teachers, six officers of the Elementary Education Department, the Kumbakonam Municipal Commissioner, the town planning officer, and four assistants of the education department. On 30 July 2014, the court sentenced the school founder Pulavar Palanichamy to life imprisonment and fined 51,65,700. Ten others, including school staff and officials from Kumbakonam and state education department, were sentenced to five years imprisonment. Eleven of those accused, including three teachers, were acquitted. Background There were three schools namely, Sri Krishna Aided Primary School, Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School and Sri Krishna Girls High School, operating in the same building in Kasiraman street in Kumbakonam, a town in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The school was located amidst residential buildings, away from the main road.Inquiry Commission report 2005, p. 103 The school had a small gate wide, immediately beyond which the classrooms were located. The classrooms did not have any partition and at the end of the classrooms, there was a stage. On the northwest side of the stage was the noon meal kitchen and a cycle stand, both of which were thatched structures.Inquiry Commission report 2005, p. 107 The northern wing in the ground floor accommodated the Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School, which had six classes, one each for LKG, UKG, I, II, IV and V. There was another entrance to the school on the eastern side. The buildings in the nursery and primary schools had no ventilation. Near the eastern entrance, there was a narrow staircase wide leading to the first floor of the building. The layout of the first floor was similar to the ground floor where classes had no separation and exit was through a narrow collapsible door. The lower end of the class on the western side was connected to the noon meal kitchen thatched roof and the cycle stand roof, where the accident occurred. The Sri Krishna Girls High School had 179, Sri Krishna Aided Primary School had 477 and Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School had 126 students in its roles, totalling to 782 students. The second floor measured * and had classes for standards VI, VII, VIII and IX of the girls high school. The third floor had an open terrace having a water tank.Inquiry Commission report 2005, p. 111-114 Accident On 16 July 2004, the fire tragedy occurred on thatched roof structure of the school. The school started at 9:15 a.m. and during one of the breaks at 10:30 a.m., one of the girls noticed the fire and alerted the teacher and the news spread to other classes.Inquiry Commission report 2005, p. 115 The fire sparked from the midday meal kitchen thatch and spread to the upper level, which also had thatched roofs and spread rapidly. The narrow staircase had sundry material, that prevented the exit of children. The staircase was also located close to the kitchen. The kitchen did not have gas stoves and fire logs were used for cooking. The school was overcrowded, having 900 children enrolled.Teets 2007, p. 103-4Ramaswamy 2007, p. 67 The thatches and the supporting bamboo poles caught fire and fell on the children and also blocked the exit. The fire service was informed at 11 a.m. and the personnel arrived in a few minutes. But since they were unprepared for such a large scale fire, the rescue services were not effective. The locals also helped by breaking the concrete window. The injured children were admitted to the Government hospital in Kumbakonam and some of them later got shifted to Thanjavur Medical College hospital. = Victims = The deceased children were taken to the government hospital for postmortem. By the end of the day of the accident, 76 children were reported deceased and their bodies had been handed over to their families by the district administration. The Collector of the district arranged for temporary wards in the government hospital for the parents to identify their children. The digging of graves for 56 bodies went on until 2 a.m. next morning, with the help of additional diggers arranged by the district administration. On 16 July, additional doctors arrived from Kilpauk Medical College, JIPMER Medical College Hospital, C.M.C., Vellore, Salem and Coimbatore to treat the injured. The casualty numbers increased to 90, 89 of whom were identified and handed over to the parents. Some of the injured were shifted to private hospitals in Kumbakonam, Madurai and Chennai as requested by parents. There were 65 who were still undergoing treatment on 16 July, although 4 of them later died, increasing the total death toll to 94. Investigation The state government deputed a committee under Justice K. Sampath to inquire into the circumstances and causes of the fire accident on 20 July 2004. The committee assumed office on 1 August 2004 and was constituted with expert members Dr Rani Kandhaswami (Former Principal, Lady Willington Institute of Advanced Studies in Education, Chennai), S.K. Saxena (Fire Officer, Madras Atomic Power Station, Kalpakkam), K. Vijayan (Clinical Psychologist, Institute of Mental Health, Chennai) and P.A. Annamalai (retired Head Master).Inquiry Commission report 2005, pp. 1-2 The committee was given a timeline of four months but extended for four times and it could finally complete the investigation on 30 June 2005. The investigations revealed that the school had not been inspected by the educational official for three years. The fire officials reported that the building laws were not followed as the school had a thatched kitchen and classroom roof, had no emergency exits and it was a \\"death trap\\".Walsh 2011, pp. 51-52Banerjee 2006, p. 298 The schools have to follow minimum safety standards, the chapter IV on fire and safety of National Building Code of India 2005 and 14435:1997 states the code of practice of fire safety in educational institutions.Walsh 2011, p. 57 A public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme Court of India by Avinash Mehrotra quoting the accident and pleading protection of life and safety of school children across various other schools in India. The school teachers were not trained properly to handle the situation. The investigation revealed that the role of teachers was highly questionable. One view held that most of them found ways to escape themselves rather than saving the children as many came out unscathed. Some of the student eyewitnesses revealed that the teachers asked them to remain in the classes. However, some hold that the teachers tried their best to rescue the children and some of them asked the children to stay in the classes as they thought the fire was just the regular smoke from the kitchen. left The committee found that the major reason for the heavy casualty was the false tactics of the management to bring the other two school students to the aided primary school to mislead the inspecting authorities about the student-teacher ratio. The management was held responsible for the whole accident. The report pointed out that the teachers were not trained in disaster management and the prohibited thatch structure was close to the classrooms. It also stated that the schools had inadequate exit facilities and had no firefighting capabilities. Pulavar Palanichamy, the owner of the schools, was reported to have used his political clout and coalesced with the municipal and the revenue department officials getting the permits for the schools. Vijayalakshmi, the noon meal organizer and teacher of the English Medium School, was held accountable for not performing her duties of taking safety precautions. Vasanthi, the head cook, lit the oven in the absence of her assistant, Sivasankari, who usually lights it. There were contrasting reports on whether Sivasankari was present in the school during the event. The Tahsildar of Kumbakonam Taluk, Paramasivam, was reported \\"dishonest\\" for granting a license under the Tamil Nadu Public Buildings (Licensing) Act, 1965 to the school. The chartered engineer Jayachandran was also held dishonest of giving stability certificate to the building without visiting the school once. The additional assistant educational officer, Madhavan for allowing the school to run without recognition for 6 years. Sivaprakasam, the assistant elementary education officer, was held accountable for allowing Madhavan, who was not competent to allow a permit to the school. Balaji, the deputy education elementary officer was accused of carelessly passing the papers signed by Madhavan.

It contains a stone traditionally identified as the one which Jesus used to mount the donkey at the start of his procession into Jerusalem. History The modern church, built in 1883, rests on the foundations of a 12th-century crusader chapel which was located in the ancient village of Bethphage, which is now a part of Jerusalem, but two thousand years ago would have been a separate village between Bethany and Jerusalem. The crusader era chapel itself was built on the foundations of a 4th-century Byzantine shrine commemorating the meeting between Lazarus' sister Martha and Jesus, after Lazarus had died. In 1867, during construction of a Franciscan monastery on the grounds, a stone, cube shaped and covered in plaster, was discovered. This stone, now called the Stele of Bethphage, was an integral part of the 12th century crusader chapel and now lies near the northern wall of the church. The Crusaders had decorated the stone and inscribed upon it in Latin, descriptions of biblical events which occurred in the area of Jerusalem and Bethphage. In 1950 the decorations on the stone were restored and five years later, in 1955 frescos were drawn on the walls and ceiling of the sanctuary. Today, as in the 12th century, pilgrims hold a Palm Sunday procession which begins at the Bethphage Church.ChristusrexTravelnet Design and Layout Inside of the church Foundations from the crusader chapel can easily be seen near the floor of the apse. Behind the altar is a fresco depicting Jesus riding a donkey to the Temple, accompanied by his disciples. The church ceiling features drawings of flowers and leaves. Colored in shades of brown, the wall frescos portray New Testament era people preparing for the procession. On one wall a group of rabbis hold a scroll which contains the second part of the verse from (). Written in Latin around the windows are the words which the people said about Jesus during the procession into the city. The main focus of the church is the Stele of Bethphage, which is set apart by wrought iron railings. There is a mirror behind the stone so that visitors can easily see the drawings on all four sides. The drawings depict the meeting between Jesus and Martha; two disciples bringing Jesus an ass and a colt, Lazarus rising from the dead, and on the side facing the altar, a drawing of a crowd of people holding palms.

On Thursday morning, 6 December 1917, she entered Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia, Canada laden with a full cargo of highly volatile explosives. As she made her way through the Narrows towards Bedford Basin, she was involved in a collision with , a Norwegian ship. A fire aboard the French ship ignited her cargo of wet and dry 2300 tons of picric acid, 200 tons of TNT, and 10 tons of guncotton. The resultant Halifax Explosion levelled the Richmond District and killed approximately 2,000 people, and the injured may have been approximately 9,000.  Origins  A classic three-island style, general cargo steamship, Mont-Blanc was a tramp steamer, carrying diverse types of cargos around the world. Mont-Blanc was built in a British shipyard at Middlesbrough, England for French owners. The ship changed owners under the French flag several times and was registered at first in Marseille, then Rouen and finally Saint- Nazaire, France. In World War I, Mont-Blanc was purchased from Gaston Petit on 28 December 1915 by the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique CGT (The French Line), \\"The History of Mont Blanc\\" the French state-owned corporation that had taken charge of much of France's wartime shipping. Final voyage to Halifax She was chartered to carry a complete cargo of miscellaneous types of military explosives from New York to France in November 1917. Mont-Blanc was not an especially old vessel but was a relatively slow, common tramp steamer, typical of many wartime freighters.The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic \\"Ships of the Halifax Explosion\\" web page indicates that Mont-Blanc was nowhere near being the oldest ship assembled in the harbour. She left New York December 1 to join a convoy in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She arrived from New York late on 5 December, under the command of Aim√© Le Medec. The vessel was fully loaded with the explosives TNT and picric acid, the high-octane fuel benzole, and guncotton. She intended to join a slow convoy gathering in Bedford Basin readying to depart for Europe, but was too late to enter the harbour before the submarine nets were raised. Ships carrying dangerous cargo were not allowed into the harbour before the war, but the risks posed by German submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations. Aime Le Medec, captain of the SS Mont Blanc Francis Mackey, an experienced harbour pilot, had boarded Mont-Blanc on the evening of 5 December; he had asked about \\"special protections\\" such as a guard ship given the steamer's cargo, but no protections were put in place. Mont-Blanc started moving at 7:30 am on 6 December, heading towards Bedford Basin. Mackey kept his eye on the ferry traffic between Halifax and Dartmouth and other small boats in the area. He first spotted the outbound SS Imo when she was about away and became concerned as her path appeared to be heading towards his ship's starboard side, as if to cut him off his own course. Mackey gave a short blast of his ship's signal whistle to indicate that he had the right of way, but was met with two short blasts from Imo, indicating that the approaching vessel would not yield her position. The captain ordered Mont-Blanc to halt her engines and angle slightly to starboard, closer to the Dartmouth side of the Narrows. He let out another single blast of his whistle, hoping the other vessel would likewise move to starboard, but was again met with a double-blast in negation. Sailors on nearby ships heard the series of signals and, realizing that a collision was imminent, gathered to watch as Imo bore down on Mont-Blanc. Though both ships had cut their engines by this point, their momentum carried them right on top of each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the Norwegian ship's bows in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in the water and the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. Imos prow pushed into the French vessel's No. 1 hold on her starboard side. The collision occurred at 8:45 am. While the damage to Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly up the side of the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street. SS Imo aground on the Dartmouth side of the harbour after the explosion At 9:04:35 am, the out-of-control fire aboard Mont-Blanc finally set off her highly explosive cargo, causing the Halifax Explosion. The ship was blown apart and a powerful blast wave radiated away from the explosion at more than per second. A temperature of and a pressure of thousands of atmospheres occurred at the centre of the explosion. Aftermath All of the crew survived, except for one sailor who may have died of blood loss after being hit by debris from the blast,Janet Kitz, December 1917: Revisiting the Halifax Explosion, Halifax: Nimbus (2006) p. 84 20-year-old gunner Yves Quequiner.SS Mont Blanc crew manifest of 9 November 1917, p. 2 Retrieved from the Ellis Island Database. Casualties included about 2,000 known dead and some 9,000 injured. More than 1,600 houses were levelled by the explosion, with another 12,000 damaged. The explosion blew the Mont- Blanc into shrapnel, which may have injured many people in the blast zone; about 250 people lost an eye to either the shrapnel or in-blown window glass shards, and 37 people were blinded. The blast was regarded as the largest man- made explosion disaster in history until Hiroshima. A judicial inquiry known as the Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry was formed to investigate the causes of the collision. Proceedings began at the Halifax Court House on 13 December 1917, presided over by Justice Arthur Drysdale. The inquiry's report of 4 February 1918 blamed Mont-Blancs captain Aim√© Le M√©dec, the ship's pilot Francis Mackey, and Commander F. Evan Wyatt, the Royal Canadian Navy's chief examining officer in charge of the harbour, gates and anti-submarine defences, for causing the collision. Drysdale agreed with Dominion Wreck Commissioner L.A. Demers' opinion that \\"it was the Mont-Blanc's responsibility alone to ensure that she avoided a collision at all costs\\" given her cargo; he was likely influenced by local opinion, which was strongly anti-French, as well as by the \\"street fighter\\" style of argumentation used by Imo lawyer Charles Burchell. According to Crown counsel W.A. Henry, this was \\"a great surprise to most people\\", who had expected the Imo to be blamed for being on the wrong side of the channel. All three men were charged with manslaughter and criminal negligence at a preliminary hearing heard by Stipendiary Magistrate Richard A. McLeod, and bound over for trial. Mackey's lawyer Walter Joseph O'Hearn asked a Nova Scotia Supreme Court justice, Benjamin Russell to issue a writ of habeas corpus.Russell agreed there was no justification for the charges and released the prisoner on 15 March 1918. As the captain had been arrested on the same warrant, he too was given a written discharge though he had not spent any time in jail. There were many people who were most displeased with Russell's decision, including Attorney General Orlando Tiles Daniels. On 2 April, an attempt by prosecutor, Andrew Cluney, on behalf of the attorney general's office to overturn the decision in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court (in banco) failed for lack of jurisdiction (as did two subsequent bids to indict Mackey on 9 April and 2 October 1918). Mr. O'Hearn pointed out the lack of jurisdiction from the outset of the proceedings. Four of the five justices, including Chief Justice Edward Robert Harris agreed. Justice Arthur Drysdale was the lone dissenter. Ultimately, Justice Russell's decision was final. The case, In re Mackey, was added as a citation to the Criminal Code of Canada beginning in 1919 under Section 262 entitled, Manslaughter defined. Russell also presided over the Commander Wyatt's grand jury hearing (19‚Äì20 March 1918) and trial (17 April 1918). The trial proceedings took less than a day and ended with an acquittal on both charges.Zemel, Joel. Scapegoat, the extraordinary legal proceedings following the 1917 Halifax Explosion (2012), , pp. In his autobiography, Russell reflected upon these particular proceedings. He stated: \\"Civium ardor prava jubentium gave me all that I could do in disposing of the cases with which I was bound to deal. One of these concerned the official in charge of the wiring across the mouth of the harbour. To suppose he had anything in the world to do with the disaster was an utterly lunatic notion. Yet my impression is that the Grand Jury insisted on finding a true bill and placing him on trial. When the bill reached me I got rid of it in the shortest and easiest way possible. It was simply nonsensical, and the fact a grand jury could find it was symptomatic of the condition of the common feeling.\\"Russell, Benjamin. Autobiography of Benjamin Russell (1932, Halifax: Royal Print and Litho Ltd.), p. 270. Drysdale also oversaw the first civil litigation trial, in which the owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found Mont-Blanc entirely at fault. Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined Mont-Blanc and Imo were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision.Russell died in 1935; Imo Pilot William Hayes died in 1960Find a grave memorial HayesMackey died in 1961Find a grave Mackey,Wyatt died in 1967Find a grave Wyatt, Remains of ship Mont-Blanc was completely blown to pieces, and the remains of her hull were launched nearly into the air.The Halifax ExplosionGround Zero: A Reassessment of the 1917 explosion in Halifax Alan Ruffman and Colin D.

Seventy-eight people, including twenty-seven men, fifteen women, and fifteen children, were killed, while seven more were injured. Most of the victims were residents of the Mumbai slums, where building and sanitation conditions are very poor. Government officials promised that the immediate family of each deceased victim would receive Rs 25,000 from the government, while the immediate family of each injured would receive Rs 10,000. Over one hundred and fifty firefighter personnel participated in search and rescue efforts, though officials reported little hope of finding any more survivors two days after the initial landslide occurred. The landslide was caused by land erosion, following heavy rains and subsequent flooding that coincided with a high tide in the Arabian Sea. According to meteorologists, more than three hundred and fifty millimeters of rain fell on the suburbs of Mumbai in the twenty-four- hour period before the landslide. In the years since the 2000 Mumbai landslide, Mumbai has been determined by the Municipal Corporation Building to contain 327 areas that are in danger of landslides, including 49 in the city and 278 in the suburbs.

Marcel Lebrun. 2011. p. 173 The shooting On Monday, January 18, 1993, Scott Pennington took a .38-caliber revolver that was owned by his father, and brought the weapon to school by concealing it in a duffel bag-type backpack. At approximately 2:45 p.m. he entered his seventh-period English class and shot at his teacher Deanna McDavid. His first shot missed, with McDavid saying, \\"Scott, what are you doing!\\", to which Pennington replied, \\"Shut up, bitch\\". The second shot hit her in the forehead, and was fatal. Students inside her class believed this was an act that McDavid arranged for her drama club. The school custodian, Marvin Hicks, and social studies teacher Jack Calhoun entered the classroom to investigate the sounds. Pennington fatally shot Hicks in the abdomen, and aimed his pistol at Calhoun without shooting him. Witnesses reported that Hicks pushed a female student away from himself before he was shot. Mandy Morse, a student inside the classroom, wrote a farewell letter to her family due to the fear she would be killed. Some students recalled Pennington threatening to kill other students, while others recall him telling the class he would commit suicide. He then held his classmates hostage before he allowed two students to leave the classroom shortly after. He then allowed students to leave the room in groups of two every minute, and allowed the last five hostages to leave the classroom at 3:01 p.m. He himself walked outside of the classroom, where he surrendered to two police officers waiting in the hallway adjacent to the classroom.

Her daughter, Lisa McNeal, is currently a Science teacher at ECHS (East Carter High School). *Marvin Hicks was born in 1941 in Olive Hill, Kentucky, and had been employed as head custodian at East Carter High School for nine years. He resided in Olive Hill with his wife Margie. Perpetrator and motives The identity of the shooter was originally protected at the time of his arrest, but was soon revealed to be 17-year-old Gary Scott Pennington. He had lived with his family in Elliott County, Kentucky his entire childhood, before moving to Carter County in August 1992. It was reported that Pennington had expressed frustration with moving to Carter County. His family was living in poverty in the years and months prior to the shooting, as the family could not afford plumbing and lacked sufficient electricity. His father, Gary Pennington, was an unemployed former laborer and coal miner who received monthly disability pensions, due to a coal mining accident. His mother Esta was a homemaker. Pennington had excelled academically since elementary school, participating in the academic team since the fifth grade and winning the Eastern Kentucky regional science competition in the seventh grade. He attended Elliott County High School for grades nine to eleven, and taught himself calculus during his freshman year. After moving to Carter County, he joined the academic team at East Carter High School. He also developed a grudge against his English teacher Mrs. McDavid after she gave him a \\"C\\" as his midterm grade. The midterm grade was for an essay Pennington had written about the Stephen King novel Rage; the content of the essay concerned McDavid, given that some of his other writing likewise focused on \\"violence, death, and dying\\". McDavid even apparently brought her concerns before her colleagues. Afterward, he said he did not dislike Mrs. McDavid, but that his intention was to kill any two people in order to become eligible for the death penalty. Because of his affiliation with the story written by Stephen King and portraying actions like the character Charlie Decker, all books that had been written by the author were taken out of the high school until recently when they added a few of the books back into the library.https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/1993/10/31/the-tragedy-in- room-108 Imprisonment A Carter County grand jury indicted Pennington on two counts of second-degree murder and 22 counts of kidnapping on June 15, 1993. Due to the difficulty of seating an impartial jury, the trial venue was moved twice, first to Morgan County and then to Johnson County. Opening arguments in his trial began on February 9, 1995. Pennington entered a plea of guilty but mentally ill, was subsequently convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years on February 28, 1995. He is currently imprisoned at the Kentucky State Reformatory in LaGrange, Kentucky after being transferred from the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville, Kentucky (see below). =Prison assault= At approximately 1:45 p.m. on April 12, 2014, a contract food service employee at the Kentucky State Penitentiary was seriously assaulted by Pennington. The employee, JoAnne Smith, was hospitalized in stable condition. At the time of the assault, Pennington was placed in segregation at the prison pending an investigation by the Kentucky Department of Corrections and the Kentucky State Police. As a result of that investigation, Pennington was indicted by a Lyon County grand jury with first degree assault, which is a Class B felony in Kentucky. In July 2015, Pennington was convicted of first degree assault on JoAnne Smith in Lyon County and was sentenced to an additional 20 years in prison. In addition to the criminal conviction, Pennington was transferred to the Kentucky State Reformatory shortly after the assault and faced internal Department of Corrections charges.

Plot summary Zack Jennings, his dad, and his new stepmother Judy have just moved back to his father‚Äôs hometown, in Connecticut, not knowing that their new house has a dark history. Fifty years ago, a crazed killer caused an accident at the nearby crossroads that took 40 innocent lives. He died when his car hit a tree, which is in Zack's backyard. Since then, his malevolent spirit has inhabited the tree. During a huge storm, a lightning hits the tree, releasing the spirit, and the spirit began looking for the descendants of those who cost him his life, starting with Zack, whose grandfather started it all.

Myers won a \\"Headphones award\\" from AudioFile magazine for her performance of the book. Reception Connie Fletcher in her review for Booklist said that the book was \\"An absorbing psychological thriller, as well as a rip-roaring ghost story, this switches points of view among humans, trees, and ghosts with astonishing √©lan\\". Kirkus Reviews described it as having \\"brief, fast-paced action chapters, tight plotting, several murders and a sympathetic main character keep things moving, as long-buried clues to the mystery of a tragic accident are revealed with some help from kindly phantoms. One friendly ghost in particular may come as a surprise. Fans of the genre won't mind some of the implausibilities; they'll keep reading\\". Jessica Miller in her review for School Library Journal said that \\"this riveting tale is written in short, easy-to-read chapters, making it a good choice for reluctant readers. Throughout the story, the main characters grow closer to one another and gain heroic traits while the \\"bad guys\\" reveal greater depths of wickedness and insanity. Readers will relate to Zack and enjoy the book's scare factor and adventure.\\" Sequels Three books, The Hanging Hill, The Smoky Corridor, and The Black Heart Crypt were written by Chris Grabenstein as sequels to this book.

It was first published in Slovenia in 2001, with a second edition in 2008 and third edition in 2011, under the title of 'Kralj ropotajoƒçih duhov'. The author has explored other ways to tell the fictionalized autobiographic story before the novel. Those included short story published in 1995 as illustrated text in Ars Vivendi magazin, and years later a screenplay for his film Sweet Dreams that won several awards at different film festivals in 2001. Plot The novel is first person narrative of a twelve year old Egon who tries to become a normal teenager with normal teenage problems of growing up in a milieu of little industrial town in then Tito's Yugoslavia with open borders to the West that allowed free visits to the other side of the iron curtain that was not so iron at the borders between modern day Slovenia and Italy, in times of record players and popular and less popular alternative music records. However for Egon, having normal teenage problems is a hard task for him. At home he is exposed to his grandmothers PTSD, which she got from World War One because of which she keeps having hallucinations of dead souls and she makes sure that Egon keeps watching dreadful illustrations of martyrs from her little book of Catholic saints and apologize to dead souls for stepping on them accidentally, which only she can see. As well at home he is exposed to neglect and scapegoating by his single mother, who is in conflict with his nona. As if that isn't enough (and too much) for a child, he gets sexually abused by teacher at school who keeps molesting him at school. Also a beautiful girl is also sexually abused by her own father at home and because of that - as the narrator tells at the end of the novel - finds escape from her nightmarish life in her death (suicide) at the end. Egon can only dream of having the kind of problems his teenage peers have, that would be sweet dreams for him. Egon survives in the novel, but has to pay a high price for the survival, a price paid by many survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Because the double life they are forced to live daily, they would need help from an adult who they could trust and who would understand them in order to integrate it, they have no other choice but to escape into new identity, which in contrast to their real child's self, who is helpless, becomes a king over the dark kingdom of nona, mother and school, as the king of (their) rattling ghosts.

In his introduction to the book Ganutell by Maria Kerr, the Maltese scholar and historian Guido Lanfranco states that in Maltese eighteenth and nineteenth century history, one finds numerous references to ganutell which can be considered to be the Maltese art of making artistic flowers. The word ganutell is derived from the Italian cannotiglio and in fact this craft, which can also be considered to be an art, was \\"imported\\" to Malta during the eighteenth century from mainland Europe. The way the craft eventually evolved has made it distinctively Maltese. This craft had its ups and downs and by the mid-twentieth century a considerable section of the Maltese population hardly knew of the existence of ganutell and only a few had mastered the various techniques of ganutell. The techniques had been passed on from generation to generation by word of mouth with little or no documentation until it seemed that this craft was destined to be forgotten. Towards the end of the twentieth century, the Education Division offered evening courses in ganutell and the craft started on its way to recovery. Today it is known not only in Malta but interest has been shown from a number of European countries, North and South America and also in Japan.

The first was built in the late 19th century and was demolished in the early-mid 1960s. As a result of this, the second was built as a \\"replacement\\" in the mid 1960s. 11-13 Flinders Street The first \\"Headquarters\\" of the Grand Lodge of South Australia of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF)IOOF(SA), home page. was located in Flinders Street, just east of Victoria Square, in the Adelaide city centre. It was a narrow 2 storey building of unremarkable external appearance. Upstairs was the Grand Lodge's meeting room, with an impressive polished jarrah floor, and was accessed by an imposing jarrah staircase. Downstairs were the offices of the Grand Lodge. At the time, the Grand Lodge of South Australia ran a number of businesses supporting the aims of a fraternal organisation and friendly society providing services for its members: * The major business was a non-profit voluntary health insurance fund for Lodge members and their families; this was before the days of the Australian version of Medicare when there was no compulsory universal health insurance. The Grand Lodge ran NHSA Branch No.2 (National Health Services Association). * Sick and Funeral Fund - an insurance fund which paid benefits to contributors (or their beneficiaries) on production of evidence of sickness or death. * Funeral Benefit Fund * Endowment Assurance Fund - a type of maturing investment popular at the time. * The Lodge was also associated with the FSMA (Friendly Societies' Medical Association, now trading as \\"National Pharmacies\\"About Us , National Pharmacies / FSMA.) which ran (and still does run) a chain of Chemist shops (pharmacies), mainly in the Adelaide metropolitan area, but also in a number of South Australia's regional centres, and recently, interstate. In the 1960s, the Reserve Bank of Australia decided to build a new South Australian office on the corner of Flinders Street and Victoria Square, on land occupied by the buildings at 1-9 Flinders Street, and also on the lane between 9 & 11 Flinders Street. The IOOF Building was acquired by the Reserve Bank, the building was demolished, and the site turned into a lane. The Grand Lodge moved to the basement of \\"Bowmans Building\\" in King William Street, purchased land at 47 Gawler Place, and commenced construction of a new office building. The new building was not to contain a Lodge meeting room; a much larger ex-Freemasons' meeting room in Castle Street, Parkside was purchased, renovated, and became the new meeting room of the Grand Lodge of South Australia. 47 Gawler Place \\"IOOF Building\\", 47 Gawler Place, AdelaidePrior to IOOF(SA) renaming to \\"KeyInvest\\", the four square signs next to the windows of the 5th, 4th, 3rd and 2nd floors displayed the letters I O O F in a black sans-serif font on a white background. As a result of the demolition of 11-13 Flinders Street, the Grand Lodge of South Australia of the IOOF purchased 47 Gawler Place in the 1960s, and built a six storey office building with a basement and a caretaker's flat on the seventh level. The Grand Lodge's various businesses were located on the ground, first and fifth (top) floors (levels 1, 2 and 6), and the other space was let, providing the Grand Lodge with income. The building was opened by SA Premier Sir Thomas Playford in 1963. In 1975, the Whitlam government introduced Medicare (then named \\"Medibank\\"), and the roles of voluntary health insurance funds changed dramatically. As in Britain with the introduction of universal health insurance in the 1940s, voluntary health insurance fund membership dropped to a fraction of former numbers, and the friendly societies had to reduce the size of their businesses and concentrate on other forms of services for their members. As in Britain, these were generally investment services, insurance services, and provision of aged care facilities (colloquially known as \\"Old Folks Homes\\"). When the Grand Lodge of Victoria registered \\"IOOF\\" as its trading name, the Grand Lodge of South Australia changed its trading name to IOOF(SA). Subsequently, with the increasing focus on investment services, on 29 May 2007, IOOF(SA) demutualized and changed its trading name to \\"KeyInvest\\". =50th Anniversary= In 2013 the Grand Lodge and KeyInvest celebrated the 50th anniversary of the opening of the building. In recent years there have been many changes to the building. The lifts have been refurbished and now also serve the 7th level of the building. A Lodge meeting room has been constructed at the rear of the ground floor.

Family and Education Ryland Adkins, as he was known at least professionally, was the son of William Adkins JP of Springfield, Northampton and his wife Harriet (n√©e Dent) of the Manor House, Milton, Northampton. He was educated at Mill Hill School, University College, London where he obtained a BA degree The Times, 31 January 1925, p14 and Balliol College, Oxford where he won a History Exhibition.The Times House of Commons 1910; Politico‚Äôs Publishing 2004 p69 He was an ardent Free churchman and was an active member of the Congregational Union. Career Adkins studied for the law and in 1890 was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple.The Times, 28 January 1890 He practised on the Midland circuit,The Times, 24 November 1892 p11 took silk in 1920 and sat occasionally as a Commissioner of Assize. He served as Recorder of Nottingham from 1911 to 1920. From 1920 until his death he sat as Recorder of Birmingham. He was knighted in 1911. PoliticsNorthamptonshire politics= Adkins was an original member of Northamptonshire County Council at its creation in 1889. He was for many years its Vice Chairman and became Chairman of the County Council in 1920. He was also Vice-Chairman of the Northamptonshire Territorial Force Association and played an important role in recruiting during the First World War.The Times, 13 July 1917 p3 He later served as Chairman of the Executive Council of the Association of County Councils. He was created Deputy Lieutenant of Northamptonshire in 1922 and served for many as a JP for the county and Borough of Northampton. Adkins was proud of his Northamptonshire heritage and was the author of a book about the county in 1893 and a contributor to a number of others including the Victoria History of the County. =Parliament= Adkins was first elected to Parliament at the 1906 general election as Liberal MP for Middleton, Lancashire in a straight fight with the Unionists by a majority of 1,533 votes. He held the seat in the January 1910 general election. Adkins held his seat again in a straight fight against a Liberal Unionist candidate, this time with a majority of 1,403 and in December 1910 with a majority of 787. =Middleton by-election, 1911= In 1911 upon his appointment as Recorder of Nottingham, Adkins was obliged by the electoral law of the day to resign his seat and re-contest it at a by-election held on 2 August 1911. His candidature was opposed by the Conservatives. W A S Hewins who was his opponent at the December 1910 general election and who had reduced his majority from 1,403 votes in January 1910 to 787 in December, stood against him again.The Times, 2 August 1911 p11 The by-election was fought mainly on the issue of National Insurance which Hewins took up vigorously, if by some accounts rather cynically. In the course of the campaign Lloyd George had to send Adkins a letter for public consumption refuting in detail Hewins‚Äô claims. Despite the strong attack however Adkins held on, although Hewins reduced his majority again, this time to 411 votes.P. F. Clarke, Lancashire and the New Liberalism; Cambridge University Press, 2007 p386 =The Marconi Scandal= Adkins played a cameo role in the Marconi scandal which broke in the summer of 1912. It was alleged that highly placed members of H H Asquith‚Äôs Liberal government, notably Lloyd George and Rufus Isaacs, had profited by improper use of information about the Government's intentions with respect to the Marconi Company. Knowing that the government was about to issue a lucrative contract to the British Marconi company, they had bought shares in an American subsidiary. In the end Parliament did not wish to see these ministers brought down over their involvement in an affair from which they had not profited unduly and it was their political judgment rather than their honour which was questioned. Adkins was chosen by the government Whips to move an amendment to a motion of censure on the issue which accepted the ministers‚Äô expressions of regret and acquitted them of acting in bad faith and of charges of corruption.H Montgomery Hyde, Lord Reading: The Life of Rufus Isaacs, First Marquess of Reading; Heinemann,1967 p159 =1918 General Election= The 1918 general election was known as the ‚Äòcoupon election‚Äô after the letter of endorsement sent to candidates supporting the coalition government of David Lloyd George. Adkins had been regarded as supporter of H H Asquith during the war and in the split in the Liberal Party occasioned by Lloyd George's replacement of Asquith as prime minister. He opposed the introduction of conscription and he voted with Asquith and against Lloyd George in the Maurice Debate of May 1918. Despite all this he received the Coalition ‚Äòcoupon‚Äô for the 1918 general election and thereafter acted in Parliament as a Lloyd George Liberal.Trevor Wilson, The Downfall of the Liberal Party; Cornell University Press, 1966 pp160-161 Adkins‚Äô Middleton seat had disappeared in a boundary revision for this election and he had been adopted as Liberal candidate for the new Middleton and Prestwich constituency. As a result of receiving the ‚Äòcoupon‚Äô Adkins did not face a Conservative opponent at the general election and held his seat comfortably with a majority of 8,330 over Labour.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p401 =Middleton and Prestwich by-election, 1920= Adkins had to go through the by-election process again in 1920 on his appointment as Recorder of Birmingham. At this by-election however he was returned unopposed as a result of an electoral truce called because of an outbreak of smallpox in Middleton and the recommendation of the medical authorities that door to door canvassing and public meetings should be avoided.The Times, 15 November 1920 p9 =1922-1924= In 1922, Adkins fought Middleton and Prestwich as a National Liberal. Although Lloyd George had been ousted as prime minister as a result of the decision of Conservative MPs at the Carlton Club meeting of 19 October 1922 to withdraw from the coalition, Adkins did not face Unionist opposition in 1922. In a straight fight with Labour candidate Matthew Burrow Farr, he held the seat by a majority of 4,327 votes. By the time of the 1923 general election however, things had changed. A degree of Liberal reunion had taken place with both the Lloyd George and Asquithian wings of the party agreeing to fight the election together in defence of the traditional Liberal policy of Free Trade which the new prime minister Stanley Baldwin had chosen to be the central issue in the campaign. The Tories had recovered their organisation in Middleton and they adopted Sir Nairne Stewart-Sandeman as their candidate. Adkins was also opposed again by Farr for Labour and in a close three-cornered fight he just failed to hold his seat by the margin of 529 votes (or 1.9% of the poll).F W S Craig, op cit Stewart-Sandeman's victory was the first recorded Conservative gain of the election.The Times, 7 December 1923 p12 Adkins attempted to regain the seat at the 1924 general election. But by this time the electorate was increasingly coming to see British politics through its traditional two-party lens, with the realistic choice for government being between Conservative or Labour parties. In a three-cornered contest with Stewart-Sandeman and Farr, Adkins came bottom of the poll with 21.7% of the votes cast.F W S Craig, op cit Other public appointments During his political career Adkins served on many different committees and public inquiries as an appointee of the government. The following are examples of his more important commissions. =Drunkenness law= In 1908 he was appointed by the Home Secretary to sit on a committee to investigate the operation of the law in relation to inebriates (drunkenness).The Times, 25 April 1908 p11 =Isle of Man constitution= In 1911 he was appointed a member of the Home Office Committee of Inquiry into the constitutional crisis in the Isle of Man,The Times, 13 April 1911 p10 which arose out of dispute between the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, the Island's Legislative Council and the British Home Office on the one side and the members of the House of Keys on the other, on the question of where responsibility for the passing of money bills should sit, with the Keys asserting primacy as the elected representatives of the Manx people.The Times, 6 March 1911 p6 =Electoral Reform= Adkins also sat as a member of the Speaker's Conference on Electoral Reform of 1917‚Äì1918, which looked amongst other things at the proposals for votes for women which came into effect for the 1918 general election.The Times, 3 February 1917 p5 The conference also proposed the ending of plural voting and the introduction of proportional representation in large urban areas The Times, 28 March 1917 p7 but these were among the recommendations not introduced. =Pensions= In 1919 Adkins was appointed chairman of a committee set up to look at the operation of the statutory scheme of Old Age Pensions.The Times, 8 November 1919 p9 The proceedings of the committee were open and public, ensuring the evidence of the witnesses concerning the poor social and economic circumstances of pensioners was placed squarely in the public domain. As a result of the committee's recommendations the pension increased to 10 shillings a week and various conditions of qualifications were relaxed in favour of applicants, including the raising of income limits, with the effect that around 220,000 additional pensioners came onto the books.John Macnicol, The Politics of Retirement in Britain, 1878-1948; Cambridge University Press, 2002 Chapter 7 ‚Äì The First World War and the Rylands Adkins Committee p167ff =Federal Devolution= Also in 1919 Adkins was a member of the Commission on Federal Devolution which looked at the implications of Irish Home Rule.The Times, 17 October 1919 p13 Adkins seemed to be especially interested in this issue of devolution and led or was a member of different deputations to the prime minister to promote home rule all round. In 1921 he backed a Parliamentary Bill to devolve certain powers from the Westminster government to subordinate Parliaments in England, Scotland and Wales.The Times, 29 April 1921 p7 =Others= In 1924 he was appointed chairman of a committee established to investigate offences against children and also served as a member of the Royal Commission on Local Government Death Adkins died at his home at Springfield, Northampton of gastric influenza on 30 January 1925, at the age of 62.The Times, 31 January 1925 p14 Publications *Author of *Introductory chapter in *Introduction to *Co-editor (with R.M.

Heidegger resigned the rectorship one year later, in April 1934, but remained a member of the NSDAP until the end of World War II.

Nevertheless, in December 1936, the SS publication Das schwarze Korps accused Schmitt of being an opportunist, a Hegelian state thinker and basically a Catholic, and called his anti-semitism a mere pretense, citing earlier statements in which he criticized the Nazis' racial theories.

Initially a loyal supporter of Adolf Hitler, he took part in the Beer Hall Putsch and held a number of high positions in the Nazi Party. Soon however, Strasser became a strong advocate of the socialist wing of the party, arguing that the national revolution should also include strong action to tackle poverty and should seek to build working class support. * Julius Streicher (1885‚Äì1946), the founder and publisher of Der St√ºrmer newspaper, which became a central element of the Nazi propaganda machine. His portrayal of Jews as subhuman and evil played a critical role in the dehumanization and marginalization of the Jewish minority in the eyes of common Germans ‚Äì creating the necessary conditions for the later perpetration of the Holocaust. He was a member of the Nazi party.The Number One Nazi Jew-baiter: A Political Biography of Julius Streicher, Hitler's Chief Anti- ‚Ä¶ WP Varga - 1981 - Carlton Press * Ernst Rudolf Huber (1903‚Äì1990) was a German lawyer who provided legal rationalizations for the Nazi regime. * Heinrich Himmler Himmler was interested in mysticism and the occult from an early age. He tied this interest into his racist philosophy, looking for proof of Aryan and Nordic racial superiority from ancient times. He promoted a cult of ancestor worship, particularly among members of the SS, as a way to keep the race pure and provide immortality to the nation. Viewing the SS as an \\"order\\" along the lines of the Teutonic Knights, he had them take over the Church of the Teutonic Order in Vienna in 1939. He began the process of replacing Christianity with a new moral code that rejected humanitarianism and challenged the Christian concept of marriage. The Ahnenerbe, a research society founded by Himmler in 1935, searched the globe for proof of the superiority and ancient origins of the Germanic race. All regalia and uniforms of Nazi Germany, particularly those of the SS, used symbolism in their designs. The stylised lightning bolt logo of the SS was chosen in 1932. The logo is a pair of runes from a set of 18 Armanen runes created by Guido von List in 1906. The ancient Sowil≈ç rune originally symbolised the sun, but was renamed \\"Sig\\" (victory) in List's iconography. Himmler modified a variety of existing customs to emphasise the elitism and central role of the SS; an SS naming ceremony was to replace baptism, marriage ceremonies were to be altered, a separate SS funeral ceremony was to be held in addition to Christian ceremonies, and SS-centric celebrations of the summer and winter solstices were instituted. The Totenkopf (death's head) symbol, used by German military units for hundreds of years, had been chosen for the SS by Schreck. Himmler placed particular importance on the death's-head rings; they were never to be sold, and were to be returned to him upon the death of the owner. He interpreted the deaths-head symbol to mean solidarity to the cause and a commitment unto death. Himmler had a lifelong interest in occultism, interpreting Germanic neopagan and V√∂lkisch beliefs to promote the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and incorporating esoteric symbolism and rituals into the SS. His reading lists, as recorded in his diary, were dominated by antisemitic pamphlets, German myths, and occult tracts. In 1923‚Äì24, Himmler, while searching for a world view, came to abandon Catholicism and focused on the occult and in antisemitism. Germanic mythology, reinforced by occult ideas, became a religion for him. * Alfred Rosenberg One of the earliest claims of Nazi occultism can be found in Lewis Spence's book Occult Causes of the Present War (1940). According to Spence, Alfred Rosenberg and his book The Myth of the Twentieth Century were responsible for promoting pagan, occult and anti-Christian ideas that motivated the Nazi party. Ernst Schertel An article \\"Hitler's Forgotten Library\\" by Timothy Ryback, published in The Atlantic (May 2003),Ryback, Timothy W. \\"Hitler's Forgotten Library\\". The Atlantic, May 2003. Accessed 27 June 2009. mentions a book from Hitler's private library authored by Ernst Schertel. Schertel, whose interests were flagellation, dance, occultism, nudism and BDSM, had also been active as an activist for sexual liberation before 1933. He had been imprisoned in Nazi Germany for seven months and his doctoral degree was revoked. He is supposed to have sent a dedicated copy of his 1923 book Magic: History, Theory and Practice to Hitler some time in the mid-1920s. Hitler is said to have marked extensive passages, including one which reads \\"He who does not have the demonic seed within himself will never give birth to a magical world\\".Kelley, JH. \\"New Translation of German Book Links Hitler to Satanism\\" (press release).

He will dance, but it is I who have called the tune. We have given him the 'means of communication' with Them. Do not mourn for me; I shall have influenced history more than any other German.\\" * Erik Jan Hanussen The documentary Hitler and the Occult describes how Hitler ‚Äúseemed endowed with even greater authority and charisma‚Äù after he had resumed public speaking in March 1927. The narrator states that ‚Äúthis may have been due to the influence‚Äù of the clairvoyant performer and publicist Erik Jan Hanussen. ‚ÄúHanussen helped Hitler perfect a series of exaggerated poses,‚Äù useful for speaking before a huge audience. The documentary then interviews Dusty Sklar about the contact between Hitler and Hanussen, and the narrator makes the statement about ‚Äúoccult techniques of mind control and crowd domination.‚Äù Whether Hitler had met Hanussen at all is not certain. That he even encountered him before March 1927 is not confirmed by other sources about Hanussen. In the late 1920s to early 1930s Hanussen made political predictions in his own newspaper, Hanussens Bunte Wochenschau, that gradually started to favour Hitler, but until late 1932 these predictions varied.Frei 1980: 85. In 1929, Hanussen predicted, for example, that Wilhelm II would return to Germany in 1930 and that the problem of unemployment would be solved in 1931. Intellectuals indirectly associated with Nazism Some writers came before the Nazi era and their writings were incorporated into Nazi ideology: *Madame Blavatsky (1831‚Äì1891), founder of Theosophy and the Theosophical Society. Guido von List took up some of Blavatsky's racial theories, and mixed them with nationalism to create occultic Ariosophy, a precursor of Nazi ideology. Ariosophy emphasized intellectual expositions of racial evolution. The Thule Society was one of several German occult groups drawing on Ariosophy to preach Aryan supremacy. It provides a direct link between occult racial theories and the racial ideology of Hitler and the emerging Nazi party. * Emile Burnouf (1821‚Äì1907) was a racialist whose ideas influenced the development of theosophy and Aryanism.Dƒ∞N Bƒ∞Lƒ∞MLERƒ∞Nƒ∞N TARƒ∞H√áESƒ∞ - Dr. Jacques WAARDENBURG - 2004/1 (281-295 s.) * Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855‚Äì1927) was a British-born author of books on political philosophy, and natural science. His two-volume book Die Grundlagen des Neunzehnten Jahrhunderts (Foundations of the 19th. Century) (1899) became a manual for Nazi racial philosophy including the concept of the master race.Shirer, William L. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, 1959, p.105 of 1985 Bookclub Associates Edition. * Julius Evola (1898‚Äì1974), a philosopher described as an \\"ultra-fascist\\" with an interest in the occult and Eastern religionsAaron Gillette.

Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there is no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology.Johannes Wallmann, \\"The Reception of Luther's Writings on the Jews from the Reformation to the End of the 19th century\\", Lutheran Quarterly, n.s. 1 (Spring 1987) 1:72-97. * Friedrich Nietzsche (1844‚Äì1900), German philosopher who developed the concept of √úbermensch.The Nietzsche Legacy in Germany: 1890-1990 - SE Aschheim - 1992 - University of California Press - The Nazi regime's ideas of the German superman were similar to those expressed by Nietzsche.

Early in the 20th century its sole purpose was that of a junction station where the lines from Keetmanshoop diverted to L√ºderitz and Karasburg. The line Keetmanshoop-L√ºderitz was built from 1905 to 1908, the line Keetmanshoop-Karasburg in 1909. The First World War was the reason to build these railway links through inhospitable land. Soon however, transport demand peaked due to the diamond rush that developed after a railway worker picked up a diamond near Grasplatz station, 24 kilometers east of L√ºderitz. People travelling from the inland to L√ºderitz had to stay overnight at Seeheim junction. This was the reason for the erection of two hotels, one of which is again in operation today after standing empty for 30 years.

Marine cloud brightening also known as marine cloud seeding and marine cloud engineering is a proposed solar radiation management climate engineering technique that would make clouds brighter, reflecting a small fraction of incoming sunlight back into space in order to offset anthropogenic global warming. Along with stratospheric aerosol injection, it is one of the two solar radiation management methods that may most feasibly have a substantial climate impact. The intention is that increasing the Earth's albedo, in combination with greenhouse gas emissions reduction, carbon dioxide removal, and adaptation, would reduce climate change and its risks to people and the environment. If implemented, the cooling effect is expected to be felt rapidly and to be reversible on fairly short time scales. However, technical barriers remain to large-scale marine cloud brightening. There are also risks with such modification of complex climate systems. Basic principles Marine cloud brightening is based on phenomena that are currently observed in the climate system. Today, emissions particles mix with clouds in the atmosphere and increase the amount sunlight they reflect, reducing warming. This 'cooling' effect is estimated at between 0.5 and 1.5 ¬∞C, and is one of the most important unknowns in climate. Marine cloud brightening proposes to generate a similar effect using benign material (e.g. sea salt) delivered to clouds that are most susceptible to these effects (marine stratocumulus). Most clouds are quite reflective, bouncing incoming solar radiation back into space. Increasing clouds' albedo would increase the portion of incoming solar radiation that is reflected, in turn cooling the planet. Clouds consist of water droplets, and clouds with smaller droplets are more reflective (because of the Twomey effect). Cloud condensation nuclei are necessary for water droplet formation. The central idea underlying marine cloud brightening is to add aerosols to atmospheric locations where clouds form. These would then act as cloud condensation nuclei, increasing the cloud albedo. The marine environment has a deficit of cloud condensation nuclei due to lower levels of dust and pollution at sea, so marine cloud brightening would be more effective over the ocean than over land. In fact, marine cloud brightening on a small scale already occurs unintentionally due to the aerosols in ships' exhaust, leaving ship tracks. Different cloud regimes are likely to have differing susceptibility to brightening strategies, with marine stratocumulus clouds (low, layered clouds over ocean regions) most sensitive to aerosol changes. These marine stratocumulus clouds are thus typically proposed as the suited target. They are common over the cooler regions of subtropical and midlatitude oceans, where their coverage can exceed 50% in the annual mean. The leading possible source of additional cloud condensation nuclei is salt from seawater, although there are others. Even though the importance of aerosols for the formation of clouds is, in general, well understood, many uncertainties remain. In fact, the latest IPCC report considers aerosol-cloud interactions as one of the current major challenges in climate modeling in general. In particular, the number of droplets does not increase proportionally when more aerosols are present and can even decrease. Extrapolating the effects of particles on clouds observed on the microphysical scale to the regional, climatically relevant scale, is not straightforward.  Climatic impacts  The modeling evidence of the global climatic effects of marine cloud brightening remains limited. Current modeling research indicates that marine cloud brightening could substantially cool the planet. One study estimated that it could produce 3.7 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing. This would counteract the warming caused by a doubling of the preindustrial atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, or an estimated 3 degrees Celsius, although models have indicated less capacity. The climatic impacts of marine cloud brightening would be rapidly responsive and reversible. If the brightening activity were to change in intensity, or stop altogether, then the clouds' brightness would respond within a few days to weeks, as the cloud condensation nuclei particles precipitate naturally. Again unlike stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening might be able to be used regionally, albeit in a limited manner. Marine stratocumulus clouds are common in particular regions, specifically the eastern Pacific Ocean and the eastern South Atlantic Ocean. A typical finding among simulation studies was a persistent cooling of the Pacific, similar to the ‚ÄúLa Ni√±a‚Äù phenomenon, and, despite the localized nature of the albedo change, an increase in polar sea ice. Recent studies aim at making simulation findings derived from different models comparable. There is some potential for changes to precipitation patterns and amplitude, although modeling suggests that the changes are likely less than those for stratospheric aerosol injection and considerably smaller than for unabated anthropogenic global warming.  Research  Marine cloud brightening was originally suggested by John Latham in 1990. Because clouds remain a major source of uncertainty in climate change, some research projects into cloud reflectivity in the general climate change context have provided insight into marine cloud brightening specifically. For example, one project released smoke behind ships in the Pacific Ocean and monitored the particulates' impact on clouds. Although this was done in order to better understand clouds and climate change, the research has implications for marine cloud brightening. A research coalition called the Marine Cloud Brightening Project was formed in order to coordinate research activities. Its proposed program includes modeling, field experiments, technology development and policy research to study cloud-aerosol effects and marine cloud brightening. The proposed program currently serves as a model for process-level (environmentally benign) experimental programs in the atmosphere. Formed in 2009 by Kelly Wanser with support from Ken Caldeira, the project is now housed at the University of Washington. Its co-principals are Robert Wood, Thomas Ackerman, Philip Rasch, Sean Garner (PARC), and Kelly Wanser (Silver Lining). The project is managed by Sarah Doherty. The shipping industry may have been carrying out an unintentional experiment in marine cloud brightening due to the emissions of ships and causing a global temperature reduction of as much as 0.25 ÀöC lower than they would otherwise have been. Marine cloud brightening is being examined as a way to shade and cool coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef. Scientists trial cloud brightening equipment to shade and cool Great Barrier Reef  Proposed methods  The leading proposed method for marine cloud brightening is to generate a fine mist of salt from seawater, and to deliver into targeted banks of marine stratocumulus clouds from ships traversing the ocean. This requires technology that can generate optimally- sized (~100 nm) sea-salt particles and deliver them at sufficient force and scale to penetrate low-lying marine clouds. The resulting spray mist must then be delivered continuously into target clouds over the ocean. In the earliest published studies, John Latham and Stephen Salter proposed a fleet of around 1500 unmanned Rotor ships, or Flettner ships, that would spray mist created from seawater into the air. The vessels would spray sea water droplets at a rate of approximately 50 cubic meters per second over a large portion of Earth's ocean surface. The power for the rotors and the ship could be generated from underwater turbines. Salter and colleagues proposed using active hydro foils with controlled pitch for power.[1] Subsequent researchers determined that transport efficiency was only relevant for use at scale, and that for research requirements, standard ships could be used for transport. (Some researchers considered aircraft as an option, but concluded that it would be too costly. Droplet generation and delivery technology is critical to progress, and technology research has been focused on solving this challenging problem. Other methods were proposed and discounted, including: (1) Using small droplets of seawater into the air through ocean foams. When bubbles in the foams burst, they loft small droplets of seawater. (2) Using piezoelectric transducer. This would create faraday waves at a free surface. If the waves are steep enough, droplets of sea water will be thrown from the crests and the resulting salt particles can enter into the clouds. However, a significant amount of energy is required.Barreras et al., 2002 F. Barreras, H. Amaveda and A. Lozano, Transient high frequency ultrasonic water atomization, Exp. Fluids 33 (2002), pp. 405‚Äì413. View Record in Scopus  Cited By in Scopus (31) (3) Electrostatic atomization of seawater drops. This technique would utilize mobile spray platforms that move to adjust to changing weather conditions. These too could be on unmanned ships. (4) Using engine or smoke emissions as a source for CCN. Paraffin oil particles have also been proposed, though their viability has been discounted.  Costs  The costs of marine cloud brightening remain largely unknown. One academic paper implied annual costs of approximately 50 to 100 million UK pounds (roughly 75 to 150 million US dollars). A report of the US National Academies suggested roughly five billion US dollars annually for a large deployment program (reducing radiative forcing by 5 W/m2). Governance Marine cloud brightening would be governed primarily by international law because it would likely take place outside of countries' territorial waters, and because it would affect the environment of other countries and of the oceans. For the most part, the international law governing solar radiation management in general would apply. For example, according to customary international law, if a country were to conduct or approve a marine cloud brightening activity that would pose significant risk of harm to the environments of other countries or of the oceans, then that country would be obligated to minimize this risk pursuant to a due diligence standard. In this, the country would need to require authorization for the activity (if it were to be conducted by a private actor), perform a prior environmental impact assessment, notify and cooperate with potentially affected countries, inform the public, and develop plans for a possible emergency. Marine cloud brightening activities would be furthered governed by the international law of sea, and particularly by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Parties to the UNCLOS are obligated to \\"protect and preserve the marine environment,\\" including by preventing, reducing, and controlling pollution of the marine environment from any source.UNCLOS, Arts. 192, 194. The \\"marine environment\\" is not defined but is widely interpreted as including the ocean's water, lifeforms, and the air above. \\"Pollution of the marine environment\\" is defined in a way that includes global warming and greenhouse gases.UNCLOS, Art. 1.1.4 The UNCLOS could thus be interpreted as obligating the involved Parties to use methods such as marine cloud brightening if these were found to be effective and environmentally benign. Whether marine cloud brightening itself could be such pollution of the marine environment is unclear. At the same time, in combating pollution, Parties are \\"not to transfer, directly or indirectly, damage or hazards from one area to another or transform one type of pollution into another.\\"UNCLOS, Art. 195. If marine cloud brightening were found to cause damage or hazards, the UNCLOS could prohibit it. If marine cloud brightening activities were to be \\"marine scientific research\\"‚Äîalso an undefined term‚Äîthen UNCLOS Parties have a right to conduct the research, subject to some qualifications.UNCLOS, Arts. 239, 242‚Äì244. Like all other ships, those that would conduct marine cloud brightening must bear the flag of the country that has given them permission to do so and to which the ship has a genuine link, even if the ship is unmanned or automated.UNCLOS, Arts. 91‚Äì92. The flagged state must exercise its jurisdiction over those ships.UNCLOS, Art. 94 The legal implications would depend on, among other things, whether the activity were to occur in territorial waters, an exclusive economic zone (EEZ), or the high seas; and whether the activity was scientific research or not. Coastal states would need to approve any marine cloud brightening activities in their territorial waters. In the EEZ, the ship must comply with the coastal state's laws and regulations.UNCLOS, Art. 58.3 It appears that the state conducting marine cloud brightening activities in another state's EEZ would not need the latter's permission, unless the activity were marine scientific research. In that case, the coastal state should grant permission in normal circumstances.UNCLOS, Art. 246. States would be generally free to conduct marine cloud brightening activities on the high seas, provided that this is done with \\"due regard\\" for other states' interests. There is some legal unclarity regarding unmanned or automated ships.  Advantages and disadvantages  Marine cloud brightening appears to have most of the advantages and disadvantages of solar radiation management in general. For example, it presently appears to be inexpensive relative to suffering climate change damages and greenhouse gas emissions abatement, fast acting, and reversible in its direct climatic effects. Some advantages and disadvantages are specific to it, relative to other proposed solar radiation management techniques. Compared with other proposed solar radiation management methods, such as stratospheric aerosols injection, marine cloud brightening may be able to be partially localized in its effects. This could, for example, be used to stabilize the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Furthermore, marine cloud brightening, as it is currently envisioned, would use only natural substances sea water and wind, instead of introducing human-made substances into the environment.

The term has also been used interchangeably with a 'good person' (, agathos), and a 'virtuous person' (, spoudaios). Among the earliest accounts of the sage begin with Empedocles' Sphairos. Horace describes the Sphairos as \\"Completely within itself, well-rounded and spherical, so that nothing extraneous can adhere to it, because of its smooth and polished surface.\\"Pierre Hadot (1998).The Inner Citadel, trans. Michael Chase. Harvard University Press, p. 119 Alternatively, the sage is one who lives \\"according to an ideal which transcends the everyday.\\"Annas, Julia. The Sage in Ancient Philosophy Several of the schools of Hellenistic philosophy have the sage as a featured figure. Karl Ludwig Michelet wrote that \\"Greek religion culminated with its true god, the sage\\"; Pierre Hadot develops this idea, stating that \\"the moment philosophers achieve a rational conception of God based on the model of the sage, Greece surpasses its mythical representation of its gods.\\"Pierre Hadot (1995). Philosophy as a Way of Life, trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, p. 58. \\"Forms of Life and Forms of Discourse in Ancient Philosophy\\", Critical Inquiry, Vol. 16, No. 3 (Spring, 1990), pp. 483‚Äì505. Indeed, the actions of the sage are propounded to be how a god would act in the same situation. In Platonism and Aristotelianism In Plato's Symposium Socrates says the difference between a sage and a philosopher (, meaning lover of wisdom) was that the sage has what the philosopher seeks. While analyzing the concept of love, Socrates concludes love is that which lacks the object it seeks. Therefore, the philosopher does not have the wisdom sought, while the sage, on the other hand, does not love or seek wisdom, for it is already possessed. Socrates then examines the two categories of persons who do not partake in philosophy: #Gods and sages, because they are wise; #Senseless people, because they think they are wise. The position of the philosopher is between these two groups. The philosopher is not wise, but possesses the self-awareness of lacking wisdom, and thus pursues it. Plato is also the first to develop this notion of the sage in various works. Within The Republic, Plato indicates that when a friend of a sage dies, the sage \\"will not think that for a good man... death is a terrible thing.\\"Plato. The Republic, 387d. In the Theaetetus, Plato defines the sage as one who becomes \\"righteous and holy and wise.\\" The Platonic sage would raise themselves by the life of their mind, while the Aristotelian sages raise themselves to the realm of the divine Mind. In Epicureanism Epicurus believed that one would achieve ataraxia by intense study and examination of Nature. This sage would be like the gods and would \\"[watch] the infinity of worlds arising out of atoms in the infinite void\\" and because of this nothing ever disturbs the peace of his soul. Certainly, they would be \\"unconcerned by mundane affairs in their bright, eternal tranquility, they spend their time contemplating the infinity of space, time, and the multiple worlds.\\"Pierre Hadot, Philosophy as a Way of Life, trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. The View from Above, p. 243 According to Seneca the Younger, Epicurus believed that the sage rarely gets married, because marriage is accompanied by many inconveniences.Emily Wilson (2014). The Greatest Empire: A Life of Seneca. Oxford University Press. p. 74 The excerpt Wilson translates from is cited as 'Fragment 5' L√©on Robin, in his commentary on Lucretius, writes \\"the sage places himself within the immutability of eternal Nature, which is independent of time.\\"Pierre Hadot, Philosophy as a Way of Life, trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. Only the Present is our Happiness, p. 226 In Stoicism The concept of the sage within Stoicism was an important topic. Indeed, the discussion of Stoic ethics within Stobaeus, which depended on Arius Didymus, spent over a third of its length discussing the sage. The Stoic sage was understood to be an inaccessible ideal rather than a concrete reality.Pierre Hadot, The Inner Citadel, trans. Michael Chase. Harvard University Press, 1998. The Discipline Of Actions, Or Action In The Service Of Mankind, p. 192 The aim of Stoicism was to live a life of virtue, where \\"virtue consists in a will which is in agreement with Nature.\\" As such, the sage is one who has attained such a state of being and whose life consequently becomes tranquil. The standard was so high that Stoics were unsure whether one had ever existed, if so, possibly only Socrates or Diogenes of Sinope had achieved such a state. Despite this, the Stoics regarded sages as the only virtuous and happy humans. All others are regarded as fools, morally vicious, slaves and unfortunate.Stoic Ethics. The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy The Stoics did not admit any middle ground, as Cicero articulated the concept: \\"every non-sage is mad.\\"John Sellers, Stoicism p. 37, University of California Press The Stoics conceived of the sage as an individual beyond any possibility of harm from fate. The difficulties of life faced by other humans (illness, poverty, criticism, bad reputation, death, etc.) could not cause any sorrow to the sage, while the circumstances of life sought by other people (good health, wealth, praise, fame, long life, etc.) were regarded by the Stoic sage as unnecessary externals. This indifference to externals was achieved by the sage through the correct knowledge of impressions, a core concept in Stoic epistemology.R.J.Hankinson, Stoic Epistemology, in The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics, Brad Inwood editor, p. 59 Thus, the sage's happiness, eudaimonia, was based entirely on virtue.M.Andrew Holowchak, The Stoics, A Guide for the Perplexed, pp. 19‚Äì25 The difficulty of becoming a sage was often discussed in Stoicism. When Panaetius, the seventh and final scholarch of the Stoa, was asked by a young man whether a sage would fall in love, he responded by saying: \\"As to the wise man, we shall see. What concerns you and me, who are still a great distance from the wise man, is to ensure that we do not fall into a state of affairs which is disturbed, powerless, subservient to another and worthless to oneself.\\" Epictetus claims that only after the removal of any attachments to things in the external world could a Stoic truly possess friendship. He also outlined that progress towards sagehood would occur when one has learned what is in one's power. This would only come from the correct use of impressions. Marcus Aurelius defines the sage as one \\"who has knowledge of the beginning and the end, and of that all-pervading Reason which orders the universe in its determinate cycles to the end of time\\".Meditations, Marcus Aurelius, trans.

Literally it means: a person or family of or originating or associated with the place called K√∂rmend, now one of the smaller townships in Western Hungary, near the Austrian border. It is evident in some public records that the same family name may have been spelled \\"K√∂rmendi\\" as compared to \\"K√∂rmendy\\". It is generally understood in the Hungarian tradition that the use of the form \\"K√∂rmendy\\" is an entitlement of some sort due to the formerly official title of nobility, received as granted in a traditional European meaning and process. The \\"K√∂rmendi\\" name, form or usage, may mean in some cases, simply a spelling variation due to whatever reasons, but in some other cases \\"K√∂rmendi\\" may be just an adopted name, not entitled to the \\"K√∂rmendy\\" form of spelling. There seem to exist many people in the world with these family names, however to this writer at this point it may be highly speculative to guess how many of these may be related at any distance, or whether there are one or more greater families covered by all these names. On the other hand, as an example, this writer has information of a document and public record granting the nobility title to a \\"K√∂rmendy M√°rton\\" and his descendants (and the same to a companion by a different name) by \\"King Ferdin√°nd I\\" of Hungary, in the year 1549.Nyitra V√°rmegye Lev√©lt√°r, VI. 385, 80/1905.

This later transcript was sent to the Hungarian National Museum and is deposited under \\"Ald√°nyi Antal, LXI 1549 janu√°r 5.\\" The above cited granting of nobility to said \\"K√∂rmendy M√°rton\\" and his descendants is due to, according to the contents of the cited document(s), a certain incident of his heroic behavior during the Hungarian defensive wars against the Turkish invaders. The said heroic act occurred in a battle at the Hungarian town Gy≈ër, rescuing some Christians from the Turks. Along with the title of nobility this \\"K√∂rmendy M√°rton\\" and his descendants were granted the right to use a certain coat of arms, described in detail within the above said letter of grant of nobility (nemeslev√©l in Hungarian).

A German officer in the First and Second World War, Volkheim rose to the rank of colonel, during World War II in the German Army. Little known outside of professional military and historical circles, Volkheim is considered the foremost military academic influence on German tank war proponent, Heinz Guderian, because both Volkheim's teaching as well as his 1924 professional military articles place him as one of the very earliest theorists of armored warfare and the use of German armored formations including independent tank corps. Life Ernst Volckheim joined the Prussian Army in 1915 as a war volunteer and in 1916 he was commissioned as a lieutenant. In 1917 he was given command of a machine gun company and served on the Western Front during the First World War. In April, 1918, as a member of the imperial tank corps, Volckheim fought in the First Battle of Villers- Bretonneux and won the tank battle's armor insignia. Shortly before the end of the war he was severely wounded. At the end of World War I, Volkheim joined the newly established Reichswehr, and served as a lieutenant in the Kraftfahrtruppe. With his transfer to an inspector of transport troops in 1923, Volckheim also began his theoretical work on the use of armored vehicles as an element of combat leadership. In 1925, Volckheim, still a young lieutenant, was ordered to the officer school in Dresden and there began to teach armored combat theory and operational concepts including in the use of motorized troops. Between 1923 and 1927, he published numerous articles and books on the subject of armored combat in the military journal, Milit√§r Wochenblatt. (Military Weekly). This work caught the attention of retired General Konstantin Altrock, the publisher of the Milit√§r Wochenblatt. Soon after, Volckheim became the magazine's editor in chief and frequent contributor to the monthly magazine. From 1932 to 1933, Volckheim was a tactics instructor, training Soviet military exchange officer instructors at the secret German-Soviet tank school \\"Kama\\" in Kazan. There, Volckheim both lectured and gained practical experience with tanks and motorized warfare. In the late 1930s, he worked on the development of the guiding principles of armored combat doctrine for the newly developed and still largely secret German armored forces. Influence on Heinz Guderian While the much better known German officer, General Heinz Guderian would claim by the 1930s to be the \\"Father of Blitzkrieg\\", and give Volckheim only passing credit, this claim has been challenged in modern times by such military historians as James S. Corum as a gross self-exaggeration. In fact, Guderian's actual publications before 1936 were relatively few in number, and historians such as Corum have claimed that they did not address questions of fundamental armored combat doctrine. Guderian's famous book, Achtung Panzer was an influential early publication on armored warfare, and while forcefully written, when compared to Volckheim's early writings, Guderian's book was not particularly original. Modern historians now see Guderian's true inspiration for German armored doctrine to be the largely unsung Volckheim. Guderian made only passing mention of Volckheim in his memoirs. Nevertheless, no matter how much Volckheim's ideas directly influenced Guderian, Guderian's much higher rank as a general officer and consequent influence within both Army and Nazi Party circles, it would be Guderian who would become one of the driving forces in both the development and wider acceptance of the possibilities of armored and mechanized forces in the German Army. World War II At the onset of World War II, Lieutenant Colonel Volckheim served on the staff of the 1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht) and subsequently commanded the 40th Armored Battalion (Panzer-Abteilung z.b.V. 40) in Norway in 1940. In 1941, he was given command of the armored troops school in W√ºnsdorf near Berlin. He was subsequently assigned to the General Staff, where he participated in the planning and execution of the secret tank operations and its tactics.

The name DCI originates from the Greek words Doulos Christo Iesous meaning \\"Servant of Jesus Christ\\", taken from Romans chapter 1, verse 1. DCI Global Partnerships are responsible for several projects including the charity DCI Trust, Schools of Mission, the Christian World News Pages and a Banking for the Poorest project. DCI ProjectsDCI Trust= DCI Trust is an international, interdenominational charity committed to mobilising and training Christian leaders, providing micro-loans for the economically poor, networking a global Christian constituency and giving to bless the poor of the earth. Its work includes: *Provides micro-funding for the local on-site creation of income *Funding for new mission to unreached people *Training for pastors and leaders *Help for people living in poverty, especially widows, orphans and children *Buildings for churches, schools and families *Schools for children and adults *Tools so villagers can earn a livingphoto album for the dci centre for mission and ministry with free bible school =Schools of Mission= Since 1987, DCI Global Partnerships has run a free diploma-level Internet training school. These studies, available in sixteen different languages, are in use worldwide and are to help people to learn and to teach others. The lessons are written by Dr. Les Norman, Th.D., M.Ph. and, since 1987, have been distributed free- of-charge to tens of thousands of students. The lessons are now taught in hundreds of free or low-cost Schools of Mission in homes and churches across the developing world.

They also provide for widows and the orphans, in order to create jobs‚Ä¶and hope. Missiological AnalysisHistorical context= The work of DCI Trust began in the mid-1980s, on the backside of a period of history that Bosch describes as having ‚Äúshaken Western civilisation to the core.‚ÄùDavid J. Bosch, Transforming Mission : Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission, Orbis Books, Maryknoll, New York, 2005‚Äîp. 363 Globalisation is in full stride; poverty and inequality have never been greater across the earth; modernity is giving way to post- modernity. Within its European heartlands, Christendom is giving way to a secular multiculturalism, whilst in Asia, Africa and South America, non- western Christianity is gaining new converts, energy and confidence at astonishing rates.Escobar, S., The New Global Mission, The Gospel from Everywhere to Everyone, Inter Varsity Press, Downer‚Äôs Grove, Illinois, 2000‚ÄîChapter 3, 54ff.; chapter 4, 70ffJenkins, P., The Next Christendom, The Coming of Global Christianity, Oxford University Press, New York, 2003‚ÄîChapter 1, 1ff Thus, the forging of DCI‚Äôs concerns and priorities has taken place in a period during which the world Christian mission movement has experienced both a growing urgency and awareness, as new technologies have allowed researchers and statisticians to investigate, analyse, assimilate and represent global trends with degrees of comprehension previously inaccessible ‚Äî for example, in 1978 the global prayer-manual ‚ÄúOperation World,‚Äù was first published; following which the evangelistically-resistant belt of the ‚Äú10/40 Window‚Äù was identified, focussed upon and targeted‚Äîmaking the world‚Äôs poorest, most neglected and most evangelistically unreached peoples reachable as never before.Johnstone, P., The Church is Bigger Than You Think, Christian Focus Publications, Ross-shire / WEC, Gerrards Cross, 2000, 11-15 = The social impact of DCI Global Partnerships= Against such a background, during the twenty-six years since its inception, DCI Trust has grown to represent an international, interdenominational community spanning five continents, touching people of over one-hundred different nationalities. Its vocational work‚Äî‚Äòanswering the call to the lost, the last and the least‚Äô‚Äîfocuses mainly upon the poor within developing nations, empowering them through leadership- training, micro-loans, business-development and community-building projects. Through networking with committed, indigenous, localised individuals who are proven, responsible leaders, DCI has contributed towards a vast, eclectic array of projects, including: ‚Äúbuildings for churches, schools and families; computers, camels‚Ä¶cars; farms, seeds‚Ä¶stock; medicines‚Ä¶operations; schools for children and adults; spectacles...tools‚Ä¶wheelchairs‚Ä¶workshops‚Ä¶bee- keeping‚Ä¶tree-planting‚Ä¶horticulture, home management, nutrition, HIV/AIDS training, fish farming, brick making, baking, disinfectant manufacture, tailoring courses, and skill training schools.‚Äù DCI World Christians pages of news, free training, mission, evangelism and social actionBosch, pp. 400-08 * Within Indonesia, DCI has partnered with Christian business people in the establishment of a small factory producing doormats, employing mainly Muslims and feeding profits back into the local church. In Burkina Faso, it has partnered with local people in the cultivation of a banana plantation, covering four hectares of dry, semi-desert land, producing local employment and a regular substantial harvest of this important ‚Äúcash crop.‚Äù DCI World Christians pages of news, free training, mission, evangelism and social action * Within Uganda, its partnership in developing a self-reproducing ‚Äúgoat bank‚Äù has witnessed phenomenal growth and interest: a local pastor reports: \\"Goats are God's project number one in this war zone of Africa. The report about (the) goat project is spreading like bush fire and we are optimistic about the effects and the result to the poor community.‚Äù DCI World Christians pages of news, free training, mission, evangelism and social action * Within Aduku, in northern Uganda, a village banking project, begun with half-a-million Ugandan shillings in 2003, oversaw a series of micro-loans to widows and orphans‚Äîmade so by war, terrorist violence and AIDS‚Äîresulting in the growth of the fund to two-and-a-half million shillings, by 2006, with no business failures! Children there now receive an education for the first time.How does the Bank for the Poor work best ? = The mission praxis of DCI Global Partnerships= DCI World Christian Network revolves around the central hub of its global Internet site, which has recorded over 20 million ‚Äòhits‚Äô, by over two million unique visitors, to its 2000 pages, presented, at least partially, in 17 languages, all of which is offered free of charge. This web portal is used to disseminate news submitted by subscribers and visitors to the website. Regular updates concerning profiled projects and people are disseminated to subscribers via email newsletter. The website details the strategies towards which the resources of DCI Trust are devoted, namely: promoting and facilitating biblical training centres or ‚Äúschools‚Äù; a range of ‚Äúbusiness for mission‚Äù projects and evangelistic support focussing upon unreached people groups and neglected members of society.The DCI Pages ‚Äî Following Jesus to the lost, the last and the least of the world, 5000 pages of free resources * The DCI ‚ÄúSchool Without Walls‚Äù resources offers a series of educational outlines divided into six divisions of evangelism, missions, discipleship, money, leadership and church growth, plus instructions on how to start a low-cost school. Each of 85 total lessons includes elements ideal for small groups, including bible memory-verses, discussion topics, homework, meditations, written diploma work, a biblical teaching and prayer prompts. Research has indicated that this format is ideal for use within developing nations where educational standards vary enormously, but where there is an insatiable hunger to learn. * ‚ÄúBusiness for Mission‚Äù projects involve mainly micro-loans within Africa and India, through ‚Äúbank for the poor‚Äù schemes, operated under the governance of a local committee, including the principal contact who has previously applied to the Trust for funding. The committee announce the availability, within a village or locality, of interest free or very low interest rate loans of $50 to $150. Schemes have a high rate of success, few loan defaulters and are regularly and easily reproduced in secondary locations.http://www.dci.org.uk/zipped/bankingmanual.pdf * ‚ÄúChristmas Parties for the Poor‚Äù are a practiced, much-valued annual event, sponsored by DCI, in which members of some of the poorest and most neglected communities, in places such as Malawi, Uganda, Peru, Indonesia, Thailand, Papua, Kenya and India are invited, at Christmas time, to a party where they receive food and gifts of clothing, books and seeds; hear the Good News about Jesus and experience joyful music and dance. Pocock writes poignantly about such phenomena: ‚ÄúFor all the efficiency of rapid communication and‚Ä¶border obliterating technology, personal relationships and simple acts of kindness may, in the end, constitute the best strategies‚Äîand they may have the most appeal in a postmodern era.‚Äù Pocock, p. 41 * DCI‚Äôs organisational modus operandi is notable: it deliberately ‚Äúowns no buildings and pays no salaries‚Äù;This statement representing DCI‚Äôs self-understanding as an organisation has largely been accepted uncritically: even though it is understood by the author that the Director of the DCI Trust is financially supported in his role, it is also understood to be neither in the form of an employment contract, nor guaranteed by the Trust‚Äîand thus not a salary in a typical sense. More significantly, the funding of central Trust staff is not especially relevant to the use of DCI as an example of a post-modern missionary organisation: the larger context in which this ‚Äòstatement of self-understanding‚Äô finds itself is the movement spawned by DCI, rather than the central Trust itself. For example, the ‚Äòmovement‚Äô clearly operates effectively in multiple cultural, overseas, non- Western settings, where no salaries are paid, where financial gifts are used for wealth-creation projects amongst the poor, as elucidated within the text and as compared to, say, financial remuneration for pastoral work or evangelistic outreach (as is typical of much aid ‚Äòfrom the West to the Rest‚Äô). This is by far the more remarkable aspect. all work is done on a voluntary basis, with workers responsible for their own funding. The central Internet hub is managed from a home-office; while up to forty contributors around the world, responsible for translating news and ‚Äúschools‚Äù pages into 17 languages, work out of homes or cyber-caf√©s, without any form of monetary remuneration, often without ever having met Trust staff face-to-face. A small core of committed friends and supporters are responsible for the majority of financial contributions to the Trust‚Äôs work. = The mission theory of DCI Global Partnerships= During its growth into a thriving network and movement, the Trust has developed a precise, post-modern, contextual theology of mission praxis, located within a series of instructions and teachings subtly scattered throughout the DCI website. This informal mission theory is supplemented by reference to developed, detailed teaching contained with the schools material. DCI stands firmly within the evangelical ‚Äòfaith mission‚Äô heritage, with emphases upon faith; prayer; recognition and development of spiritual gifting; engagement in elements of ‚Äòspiritual warfare‚Äô; motivation focussing upon God‚Äôs glory, rather than escape from hell and a cultural sensitivity that places a strong emphasis on indigenous leadership and strategy.Bosch, p. 447-57Pocock et al, p. 34-6, 161Miller, D. L., Discipling Nations: The Power of Truth To Transform Cultures, WYAM Publishing, Seattle, WA , 2000, p. 25-7 An open, relationship-centred approach marks the DCI movement as essentially postmodern, as typified by this introduction to the ministry: ‚ÄúThe movement has no formal leaders,Whilst Dr Les Norman is clearly ‚Äúin the lead‚Äù and responsible for setting the entire tone of the DCI Trust work via the website‚Äîand, in that sense, inarguably a leader‚Äîas noted above with respect to the issue of salaries, the wider context of the movement is where the real point is made. For example: Bank-for-the-Poor projects and Mission Schools started entirely with DCI resources are not required (nor I believe, requested or encouraged) to incorporate the DCI name (except in providing credit as the source of teaching materials, for example). Local pastoral leaders, whilst being accountable to DCI for agreed use of resources received, remain entirely accountable to their own local leaders in respect to the detailed logistics of projects and certainly in all other regards of their lives and ministries. Thus, they are not encouraged to see themselves as ‚ÄòDCI leaders,‚Äô only partners-with-DCI in shared project work. elders or written constitution other than the Bible. We work together in friendship, supporting each other in God's call to different kinds of lifestyle and mission.‚Äù Bosch, p. 467-74 This practical ecumenism is echoed in the warm welcome provided to Catholic visitors to the website,Bosch, p. 457-467 as well as the discreet place given to the formal statement of belief (Nicene Creed), but above all through the opportunities provided by the website, encouraging readers to act out their own faith, supplemented by the experience and resources offered by DCI.DCI World Christians pages of news, free training, mission, evangelism and social action Nevertheless, inside this \\"velvet-gloved\\" approach is a firm hand insisting, above all, on biblical standards of responsibility or stewardship from those who are offered partnership: ‚ÄúWe look for a woman or a man with proven honesty and with a vision for serving the poor, and who also has the necessary spiritual and administrative skills.‚Äù This focus upon leadership and community development through locally initiated, -managed and -accountable training centres echoes a trend which Pocock describes as an essential counterbalance for ‚Äòinternetworking‚Äô ministries powered by new technology, if they are to avoid ‚Äú‚Äùthe dehumanising tendency of globalisation.‚Äù Additionally, DCI‚Äôs concentration upon biblical education constitutes a vital step towards transforming cultures towards a biblical worldview, something Miller considers an essential precursor to sustainable development.Pocock et al, pp. 43-4Miller, Chapters 1- 2 In this context, DCI‚Äôs focus upon financial partnership and economic development is under-girded by a biblically-based philosophy that envisages the whole task of mission as broader than vocal evangelism.Bosch, pp. 409-20 * For the poor, especially those receiving assistance, there is an emphasis upon ‚Äúbreaking the curse of poverty‚Äù‚ÄîMiller refers to a ‚Äòmindset of poverty‚Äô‚Äîand avoiding dependency through economic self-start initiatives. Thus, micro-loans are offered with the single, declared aim of ‚Äúcreating genuine self-employment through micro-industries or working from home with the sole goal of being able to raise the owner and the workers to a place of self-sufficiency in life and enabling them eventually to be generous towards others.‚Äù DCI Banking for Poor Micro-Credit and Bank ProjectsMiller, p. 67ff. * For the rich there is an emphasis upon generosity toward the poor, based upon the text of Deuteronomy 15.7-11; financial supporters of ‚Äòbusiness for mission‚Äô projects are encouraged to consider their giving to it as definite ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù regarding which they should expect a return, made possible by the Lord‚Äôs blessing, according to Luke 19.13ff. The concept of ‚ÄòChristmas parties for the poor‚Äô is based decisively upon the story in Luke 14. * For those wanting to ‚Äògo‚Äô or extend their mission activities there is a novel challenge, away from traditional ‚Äúfund-raising,‚Äù towards prayerful ‚Äúfriend-raising‚Äù and ‚Äúfund-releasing‚Äù! Escobar, p. 139 = Missiological observation= The manner and format of DCI Trust‚Äôs work and growth represents many of the trends being increasingly discussed within Christian mission books, ‚Äòblogs, newsletters and ministries, typifying the ‚Äúnew approaches to collaboration in training, funding and networking‚Äù increasingly required within a post-modern context. As such it represents an authentic, missiological, post-modern, intercultural Christian community involved in transforming the harsh reality of some of the world‚Äôs most deprived communities.Pocock et al, p. 72; see also Pocock et al, Chapters 9 to 11, discussing ‚ÄòBeyond Individual Efforts to Networks of Collaboration‚Äô, ‚ÄòFrom Self-Support to International Partnership‚Äô and ‚ÄòLife in the Virtual World and Beyond‚Äô.

The rabbit fish is known for its characteristically large head and small, tapering body. With large eyes, nostrils, and tooth plates, the head gives them a rabbit-like appearance, hence the nickname ‚ÄúRabbit fish‚Äù. They can grow to and live for up to 30 years.  Morphological Description  Illustration by P. J. Smit The appearance of C. montrosa shares characteristics of its close relatives, sharks. It characteristically has a large head and a tapering body that ends in its whip-like tail, and has a short snout with an overhanging mouth. The top dorsal fin is positioned high on the spine of the fish, and is triangular and tall in height. Positioned in the mid-section of the fish, the spine runs throughout the length of the fish and continuously joins with the upper part of the caudal fin; this dorsal spine is also mildly poisonous and can cause painful stings. One distinguishing feature of the fish, compared to its close relatives, is the anal fin, which is distinctly separated from lancet-shaped caudal fin. The color is silver-green with spots of brown. Additionally, they have marmor- white stripes in all directions with a distinct lateral line can be seen clearly on the head. The rabbit fish can grow up to long, and weigh . More specifically, this chimaera species is characterized by a slow-growth rate, and a long life expectancy. In the study of one population, the theoretical asymptotic length of this fish was estimated at 78.87 cm with a yearly growth rate of 6.73% per year. With these estimates of growth, the study also suggests the maximum ages of the fish to be 30 years for males and 26 for females, with the maturity age of the sample being 13.4 years for males and 11.2 years for females. Distribution and habitat The geographic habitat of the fish has been registered around the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern parts of the Atlantic Ocean. This geographic range starts northwards Morocco and extends to the northern areas of Norway and Iceland in the Northern North Sea. Within these geological areas, the depth range of C. monstrosa is , but it is most abundant in upper to middle continental slope habitats at depths of . Within these parameters, the water temperatures of the species habitats are most commonly in the range . There have been reports of summer inshore migration of C. monstrosa to lay eggs in depths as low as 100 m. Diet Chimaera monstrosa is classified as a benthophagous species. This means that its main diet comprises bottom-feeding invertebrates. This includes animals such as crabs, molluscs, octopuses, sea-worms, and sea urchins. However, studies have also shown that C. monstrosa are opportunistic feeders. Comparing the digestive tracts of individuals with varying body sizes, a study found that the diet of the species was widely diverse in relation to size. Specimens smaller than 22 cm mainly fed on amphipods, while those with lengths between 22 and 46 cm fed on both amphipods and decapods. Larger individuals (>46 cm) had a narrow diet spectrum, consuming mainly decapods. Conditioned by predator size group, significant differences in diet were observed between geographical areas and depths. This suggests that despite some degree of prey specialization according to predator size, this deep-water species can change its diet in accordance with the food-restricted environment that characterizes its habitat.  Reproduction  Chimaera monstrosa are fish that have distinct sex from birth. They reproduce by internal fertilization of male and female. For reproduction, C. monstrosa displays a small club like structure with a bulbous tip armed with numerous sharp denticles located on the top of the head. This structure is suggested to be used by male fish to grasp the pectoral fin of the female during copulation. The species is also oviparous, meaning that the embryo development happens in eggs, and not in the female. Specifically, the reproductive tendencies of the Chimaera monstrosa show sexual segregation in different depths of water, with the females living at lower depths. This segregation of thesexes is attributed to two main factors: the regulation of sperm in males in warmer and shallower waters, and less aggression of sex. For males, they live in water 500‚Äì600 m to regulate sperm. For the females, they prefer deeper waters of 800 m, but go up to depths of 500‚Äì600 to mate with males. After mating, they migrate inshore to lay eggs in the spring of summer.  Conservation  According to the IUCN Red List, Chimaera monstrosa is categorized as vulnerable. Due to its high levels of lipids, the species has gained interest in fisheries for its liver oils to manufacture dietary supplements. Aside from its values for oil, the C. monstrosa is mainly discarded as bycatch product in fishing.

October 1891 The Lehigh Valley Terminal Railway was a Lehigh Valley Railroad company organized in 1891 through the consolidation of the companies that formed the Lehigh Valley's route from South Plainfield through Newark to Jersey City via its bridge across Newark Bay. Until 1895, when the Greenville and Hudson Railway was constructed, the Lehigh Valley depended on the National Docks Railway to reach the Hudson River terminal. In 1903, all the Lehigh Valley's lines in New Jersey were consolidated under the name of Lehigh Valley Railroad Company of New Jersey.  Timeline of the Lehigh Valley Terminal Railway  * 1871 - The Lehigh Valley leases the Morris Canal, which includes the canal basin at South Cove in Jersey City. * 1872 - The Lehigh Valley acquires land on the south side of the Morris Canal basin, intending it for a proposed railroad, the New Jersey West Line, which was never built. * 1875 - The Easton and Amboy Railroad opens for traffic. Passenger traffic is routed onto the Pennsylvania Railroad at Metuchen. * 1887 - The Roselle and South Plainfield Railway opens on Dec 17. Freight traffic connects to the Central Railroad of New Jersey at Roselle. * 1887 - The Lehigh Valley settles a long legal battle with the Central Railroad of New Jersey, opening the way to build a Jersey City terminal on the land originally purchased in 1872 for the New Jersey West Line. * 1889 - The Jersey City terminal opens as the Jersey City Terminal Railway. * 1890 - The Edgewater Railway is formed to construct lines on the north side of the Morris Canal basin. * 1890 - The Newark and Passaic Railway builds a freight yard and coal depot at Hamburg Place, Newark. * 1890 - The LVRR purchases a half interest in the National Docks Railway. * 1891 - The Newark and Roselle Railway and the Newark Railway open to connect with the PRR in Newark. On February 16, passenger traffic through Metuchen is discontinued in favor of the LVRR's own line at South Plainfield. * 1891 - The companies are consolidated as the Lehigh Valley Terminal Railway Company. The route to Jersey City is still incomplete due to legal and engineering difficulties with the Jersey City, Newark and Western Railway bridge across Newark Bay. The consolidated companies are: :: Roselle and South Plainfield Railway :: Newark and Roselle Railway :: Newark and Passaic Railway :: Newark Railway :: Jersey City, Newark and Western Railway :: Jersey City Terminal Railway :: Edgewater Railway * 1892 - The route opens for traffic across Newark Bay to a connection with the National Docks Railway in Jersey City. (see:Lehigh Valley Railroad Bridge * 1895 - The Lehigh Valley creates the Greenville and Hudson Railway to construct a line roughly parallel to the National Docks Railway from the Newark Bay bridge to the Jersey City terminal.

Originally part of the estate of the Barons Sherborne of Gloucestershire, they developed Standish Court as part of their holdings. Abandoned in the 16th century, they then developed Standish House as a country retreat. Having sold Standish Wood to the National Trust, they sold Standish Park and Standish House to Gloucestershire County Council post-World War I, on which they developed Standish Hospital, which was immediately passed to the British Red Cross for treatment of soldiers. In the 1920s it became a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients, and a US Army medical facility during World War II. Developed by the National Health Service (NHS) as a specialist hospital, it closed in 2004.

It runs along the Isar river and is part of the line between Munich and Passau.  History  The route was completed between Plattling and Pilsting on 15 October 1875 and between Landshut and Pilsting on 15 May 1880. It was intended to link Munich to Prague as the southern section of the Bavarian Forest railway, but due to the unfavourable terrain through the mountains of the Bohemian Forest, there was never a large amount of cross-border traffic on the line. Instead much of it went (as it still does today) via Regensburg and the Schwandorf‚ÄìFurth in the Wald railway. Even as the route from Landshut to Pilsting was being built, the section from Pilsting to Landau (Isar) was expanded to two tracks. This second track was lifted in 1942, due to the war, and transferred to the occupied territories. Electric operations began on 25 May 1976 in order to avoid the time-consuming and costly change of locomotives in Landshut and Plattling for trains on the Munich‚ÄìLandshut‚ÄìPlattling‚ÄìPassau route. This 83 kilometre-long route was electrified and upgraded at a cost of 13 million DM (6.6 M euros). Three new bridges were built, one torn down and 1,035 catenary masts erected.  Operations  There are 35 level crossings on the Landshut‚ÄìLandau (Isar) section. = Current operations = In the 2009 timetable the passenger trains services on route number KBS 931 are: * The Regional-Express service, Passau‚ÄìPlattling‚ÄìLandshut‚ÄìMunich, which is worked every two hours by electric locomotives of Class 111 hauling two double-decker coaches and two Silberling local passenger coaches (or n-coaches) in push-pull operations with 374 seats in 2nd class and 42 in 1st class. At peak times they are reinforced by additional double-deckers and n-coaches. At the weekend, they operated with four double-deckers and two n-coaches. * In addition, since 1998, a Plattling‚ÄìLandshut‚ÄìFreising‚ÄìMunich RegionalBahn train runs every two hours, sometimes only as far as Landshut or Freising, and comprising push-pull trains, formed from Class 143 locomotives with four to five n-coaches. These Regionalbahn trains are usually timetabled to meet at Dingolfing. * During morning and evening peak times other Regionalbahn trains are underway. In the afternoon, they also provide a connexion at Landshut to the Regional-Express trains from Munich. They are formed from Class 143 locomotives with five n-coaches or Class 111 locomotives with two double-deckers and four n-coaches. Passenger trains are timetabled to cross at all available crossing stations en route. In addition, quite a few long goods trains run from Dingolfing (BMW factory) via Landshut to Munich and Regensburg. = Future of passenger services = With effect from the timetable change on 13 December 2009, passenger services are due to be exclusively providely by the Danube-Isar Express (Donau-Isar-Express),DB press release a Regional-Express line, that will connect Munich with Landshut, Plattling and Passau hourly.StMWIVT press release This was announced during the tender process to DB Regio. In addition a late weekend connexion from about 0:45 hours from Landshut to Passau will be provided. In connexion with this, the current Munich‚ÄìPlattling Regionalbahn train will be scrapped.BEG information Once the Danube-Isar Express goes into service, trains will no longer stop at Otzing halt. However, the majority of trains will then call at the two other current Regionalbahn stations at Wallersdorf and W√∂rth (Isar). In order to provide hourly services at all stops, the route will have to be upgraded for higher speeds and longer double- tracked crossing sections.  Expansion measures  Before the arrival of the Danube-Isar Express, the section from Dingolfing to Landau is being modernised and upgraded to take higher speeds,Shortening of the journey times between Landshut and Plattling a new platform is being built at Dingolfing on track 1 and an electronic signal box installed to reduce the waiting time when trains cross.Modification to Dingolfing station = References = Sources  Eisenbahnen in Niederbayern and der Oberpfalz, Walther Zeitler, Buch&Kunstverlag; Oberpfalz, Amberg 1985/1997, Category:Railway lines in Bavaria ","title":"Landshut‚ÄìPlattling railway"},{"id":"20940471","text":"\\"The Christmas Shoes\\" is a Christmas-themed song by the Christian vocal group NewSong. The song was released through Benson Records as a bonus track on their 2000 album Sheltering Tree, at the urging of St. Louis and syndicated radio personality DC (of Steve & DC). DC also co-wrote and co-produced the hit single in the Summer of 2000. and it reached No. 31 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. \\"The Christmas Shoes\\" spent one week at No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart and No. 42 on the Hot 100 chart. It was written by NewSong group members Eddie Carswell and Leonard Ahlstrom, and radio personality Isaiah \\"D.C.\\" Daniel. Content The song recounts the events experienced by a narrator completing the last of his gift-shopping on Christmas Eve. He is waiting in the checkout line behind a young boy who wants to buy a pair of shoes for his terminally-ill mother: she will die soon and he wants her to appear beautiful when she meets Jesus. He is short on money and the narrator ends up paying for the shoes, which reminds him of the true meaning of Christmas.

It was shot in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It is the first part in a trilogy of films, followed by The Christmas Blessing (2005) and The Christmas Hope (2009). Plot The film has several intertwined plot lines: One story is about a driven, workaholic lawyer named Robert Layton and the impact of his job on his marriage to Kate, and to his relationship with his daughter Lily. Another is about Robert's mother Ellen, and her friendly neighbor Dalton who is a teacher at Nathan and Lily's school. The main story is about Maggie Andrews and her terminal illness, and how her family (small businessman husband Jack and young son Nathan) deals with the impending loss. All stories are linked together. The story opens with Robert visiting the cemetery shortly before Christmas. He sees a younger man wearing a Boston Red Sox Cap visiting another grave. We flash back... Robert is leaving his office and notices a delivery truck driving away. He sees that a box has fallen out of the back of the truck and opens up the box to find a pair of red brocade shoes with gold trim. After repeatedly failing to remember to take the shoes to Wilsons Store, Robert finally returns the shoes to Tom Wilson, the owner of Wilsons. Outside the store, Robert's car won't start and Tom tells him about a great repair shop run by Jack. Next, we see an increasingly tired Maggie and eventually learn that she has congestive heart failure due to a virus and is now in need of a transplant. As Maggie gets weaker, Kate takes over Maggie's volunteer job directing the local school choir during the Christmas season. One day, Nathan overhears his mother telling Kate how she and Jack met at a dance studio, and how every year on their anniversary they would to go dancing. Nathan now knows that he wants to get his mom a very special pair of dancing shoes for Christmas. He goes to Wilsons store and finds a beautiful pair of red Christmas shoes he just knows his mom will love...the same shoes Robert returned to Wilsons store. Nathan set out to save the money to buy the shoes by collecting soda pop cans after his dad tells him each is worth a nickel. Dalton helps care for Nathan after school and takes him to meet his neighbor Ellen. Ellen gives Nathan her son's old Red Sox Cap. She then takes Robert's old lunch box and writes Robert a note to place inside. Maggie does not receive her heart transplant because a test showed the heart had Hepatitis B. By the time they find another heart she will be too ill to undergo the operation. Maggie decides to go home to die. Ellen sees Dalton loading large bags filled with empty soda pop cans into his trunk. Ellen tells Dalton that she is going to leave the outside Christmas light on for a while. The next morning the lights are still on and Dalton discovers that Ellen has died. Later when Dalton is walking with Nathan, he tells Nathan that his wife died 11 years ago. He tells Nathan to cross over to an alley, where Nathan finds a large number of empty soda pop cans. On Christmas Eve, while Maggie is home in her bed dying. Nathan runs out of the house to Wilson's Department Store - only to find the door locked. Robert is late, as usual, going to Wilson's to pick up gifts for his wife and daughter. Together they get the store clerk to open the door, which we find out \\"sometimes locks itself\\". When Nathan runs to the counter in front of Robert to pay for the shoes, the very rude clerk tells him he does not have enough money to pay for them. Robert standing behind him overhears the clerk tell Nathan he does not have enough money to buy the shoes and sees Nathan get very upset. Robert asks Nathan what is going on. Nathan explains that he wants the shoes for his mom, for whom this will be her last Christmas, so that she will be beautiful in heaven. After hearing the story, Robert pays the balance of the money needed. Nathan thanks Robert, and runs all the way back to his house. Robert leaves the store without the gifts, coming to the realization that being with his family is the greatest gift he can give them. His car won't start again and asks Tom Wilson to give him a ride. Tom asks him if he is going to the Christmas concert. Robert says yes and Tom tells him it is at a new location. Meanwhile, Nathan gives his mom the shoes. She says they are the most beautiful shoes she has ever seen. Robert and Tom arrive at the new location for the Christmas concert and meet Kate and Lily. The concert is in front of the Andrews home where they are caroling for Maggie. After the vigil, a group of Robert's clients thank Robert for all he is doing for them and giving them hope at Christmas. Robert and Kate reconcile. The family sees the light go off in Maggie's room. Later, Robert sees the package his mom Ellen had sent, and reads the note inside. She would be happy to know he is making time for his family just as she wanted for Robert. We flash forward to present time at the cemetery. Robert tells the younger man that he likes his Boston Red Sox Cap. After the younger man leaves, Robert sees the red shoes on the grave the young man was visiting. He realizes who he is and calls after him, but he has already driven off. Robert smiles to himself, and heads back to his car.

Their music has melodic, discordant and ambient elements. History Kingsbury formed in 2003 in Orlando, Florida when songwriter Bruce Reed met bass player Mark Freeman and drummer T.J. Burke. Reed had recorded a number of songs on a four-track machine. In December 2003 guitarist Nick Sanders and keyboardist Riley Anderson also joined the band. In early 2004, the band release their first record, a 4-song EP called This Place is Coming Down. The band started playing shows in and around Central Florida, then in other parts of Florida. This Place is Coming Down received positive reviews from several media outlets. Lost at Sea Magazine said that \\"This Place is Coming Down not only introduces a band with real great potential, but one that is already writing mature interesting music.\\"Lost At Sea Magazine Delusions of Adequacy said that \\"This Place is Coming Down is a strong achievement from a talented group of musicians looking to break their way into the often tumultuous indie- rock scene.\\"Delusions of Adequacy In August 2004, Kingsbury began their first tour, focusing on the Southeast United States. In 2005, Kingsbury released their second EP The Open Sea. Kingsbury completed two tours in the summer of 2005 in support of The Great Compromise, the first tour focusing on the Southeast U.S. and the second covering the Northeast and west to Chicago. After the second tour in 2005, Nick Sanders left the band and Riley Anderson was fired, and the remaining trio began writing a full-length album, which they recorded mostly by themselves at their home studio, Sugarwood Studios in Winter Park, Florida. Their friend Wes Jones of Apollo Quartet assisted with extra guitar tracks and other instrumentation. The album, entitled The Great Compromise, was completed in the Fall of 2006 and released in January 2007. After the initial recording was complete, Samantha Christine (guitar) and Alexis Hamlin-Vogler (keyboards vocals) joined the band. The Great Compromise featured much more use of electronic equipment such as drum machines and sequencers. Amplifier Magazine said that the record \\"encourages dark introspection while discouraging the puerile moping that's too often present in contemporary rock and folk music.\\"Amplifier Magazine and REAX Magazine called the album \\"mesmerizing.\\"REAX Magazine The band toured throughout Florida and the Eastern U.S. heavily in support of The Great Compromise. Hamlin-Vogler subsequently left the band to pursue a career in cosmetology. The band has been a four-piece since. In 2008, the band wrote and recorded a six-song EP entitled Lie to Me. Two of the tracks on this EP were ambient electronic instrumental tracks. The EP was released digitally for free via download on the band's website. As of 2009, the band was self-promoting the new EP and preparing for a number of shows to support the recording. Kingsbury also recorded two cover songs to be featured on a New Order tribute compilation CD. Style On the release of The Open Sea, the Orlando Weekly described Kingsbury as \\"buried in a resonant cavern full of downcast melodies and spacious arrangements, with a slightly trippy patina mixing up the metaphor\\". The review added that they were in the \\"canon of Orlando-bands-who- shouldn't-be-from Orlando\\". Commenting on the sound, the paper commented that \\"the linchpin in the group's sound is the interplay between the piano (which drives most of the melodies) and the guitars (which provide most of the atmosphere)\\".

Founded in 1950 in East Germany, the company focused from the beginning on the production and development of steroids. Due to the economic circumstances of the Eastern Bloc, the company initially used a unique process of steroid synthesis starting from hog bile, however this method was abandoned a decade later in favor of total synthesis. Initially the company produced a wide range of generic steroids, including corticosteroids, but later on it focused on anabolic steroids, estrogens and progestins. Prior to Germany's reunification Jenapharm was the only supplier of hormonal contraceptives in East Germany. It successfully marketed a number of drugs it had developed in collaboration with other East German chemists. Perhaps the most well known of these is Valette, which sold well in Germany in the 1990s. After the reunification, Jenapharm eventually became a subsidiary of Schering AG, which sold its generic therapeutics businesses to Dermapharm AG in 2004, and a year later restructured the marketing and distribution of Jenapharm into an independent subsidiary while integrating the research and development branch with its own laboratories. East Germany had been running a state-sponsored mass doping program for its athletes with anabolic steroids, mostly with Oral Turinabol, a product that Jenapharm had developed. In 2005 the company was sued or threatened with lawsuits by hundreds of athletes who were forced to take these drugs. The company settled the lawsuits by contributing to the creation of a $4.1 million fund that compensated former athletes.  History  During the occupation of Germany at the end of World War II, all pharmaceutical companies from Nazi Germany were located in the Western-occupied areas. Jena, which fell in the Soviet-controlled area, had an Institute for Microbiology -- the Schott-Zeiss Institute -- that had the prerequisites for small scale pharmaceutical production. Although the institute had been founded in 1944 with just 9 employees, Hans Kn√∂ll produced there the first batch of penicillin made in Germany, right before the end of the war. In 1948 the institute was producing 10 billion IUs of penicillin per month. In the late 1940s rickets was rampant amongst the children in the Soviet-occupied zone. In 1949 Alfred Schubert, who first developed a method of synthesis of vitamin D2 at the Friedrich-Schiller University, set up and industrial process that produced about 10 kg/year of Vitamin D2. (Vitamin D2 was superseded by vitamin D3 10 years later). In the same year the institute was tasked to synthesize steroid hormones, in particular cortisone. At the end of 1949 it received official permission to manufacture and market pharmaceuticals, and the public company VEB Jenapharm was founded on January 1, 1950. At the time the company already had about 600 employees. Diosgenin and hecogenin, which were commonly used in the West as precursors for steroid synthesis, were not available in East Germany, and for political and economic reasons, these substances could not be imported. Jenapharm developed an alternate process starting from hyodesoxycholic acid extracted from hog bile, from which they first produced pregnenolone, and subsequently progesterone and desoxycorticosterone acetate in 1954/1955. In that decade research and production continued to be closely intertwined at Jenapharm. Alfred Schubert was both Research Director and manager of the plant that produced steroids. Between 1957 and 1962 Gerhard Langbein further expanded the gamut of steroids that Jenapharm produced using its unique process to include testosterone, 4-chlorotestosterone, cortexolone, cortisone, cortisol and prednisone. Chlormadinone acetate was the first oral contraceptive produced by Jenapharm. It was sold under the name Ovosiston starting in 1964, and was also produced from hog bile. In the 1960s East German scientists tried to find an alternative to hog bile as the precursor for steroid synthesis by cultivating Solanum auriculatum, but these efforts failed to achieve industrial scale. Attempts to use sugar cane wax from Cuba or cholesterol from animal spinal cords also proved uneconomical. To remain competitive on the steroids market Jenapharm moved towards total synthesis. They used Igor Torgov's synthesis scheme, which was not patented in the GDR, and ironically was ignored by other Soviet chemists. Initially Jenapharm managed to produce only 25‚Äì75 kg of entirely synthetic steroids annually, but after tuning the process through more than 100 patented improvements, production reached about 5 tons per year in the 1980s. The move to total synthesis forced however Jenepharm to abandon the corticosteroids market. At the end of 1980s Jenapharm had sales of around DM200m ($112m) and 1700 employees, and was amongst eastern Germany's three largest pharmaceuticals producers with production plants at Jena, Erfurt, Naumburg and Magdeburg. It produced a wide range of products, but 50% of sales were in hormone products. In 1991 Jenapharm was privatized and sold to Gehe AG, a subsidiary of Franz Haniel & Cie GmbH, after an initial bid by Schering AG failed, but by October 2001 Schering had acquired 100% ownership of Jenapharm stock.  Original products  Skeletal formula of Oral Turinabol In the 1960s Jenapharm had fewer than 40 employees working on developing new products. This lack of dedicate resources translated in few original products. The first original product developed at Jenapharm was 4-chlorodehydromethyltestosterone, an anabolic steroid which was marketed under the name Oral Turinabol. This product later became infamous for being the most often used anabolic steroid in doping East German athletes under a state-sponsored program. In 1967 Jenapharm, using mechanisms of the centralized East German economy, initiated a collaboration with other chemists from the East German Academy of Sciences to synthesize strongly active estrogens with a depot effect. This effort bore fruit a decade later. In 1978 the company brought to market the first once-a- week oral contraceptive Deposiston, a combination of ethinylestradiol sulfonate and norethisterone acetate. The other product that resulted from this collaboration was Turisteron (ethinylestradiol sulfonate) that proved efficacious in treating androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate. Chemical structure of dienogest In 1975 Kurt Ponsold, in cooperation with Jenapharm, synthesized a new progestin -- dienogest. The combination ethinylestradiol/dienogest was efficacious as oral contraceptive. It was marketed initially as Certostat, and later as Valette). After sales debuted in 1990, within only a few years Valette become the most sold oral contraceptive on the German market. Jenapharm managed to take the top spot in German market share for oral contraceptives with 18%, compared with Schering's 13-14%. In 1996 Valette had annual sales of DM40m. This was a compelling reason to Schering to acquire Jenapharm.  Doping and lawsuits  Heike Drechsler, Silke Gladisch, and Sabine Rieger, who set multiple world records, had an ambiguous relationship with the use of AAS. Starting from 1966, East Germany ran a vast state-sponsored program of doping. The state gave grants and organized symposia where scientists and physicians who served as unofficial collaborators for the Ministry for State Security (\\"Stasi\\"), including top- ranking professors, collaborated on doping research and methods of drug administration that would evade detection by international doping controls. GDR physicians administered prescription drugs as well as unapproved experimental drug preparations to several thousand athletes every year, including to minors of both sexes. Special emphasis was placed on administering androgens to women and adolescent girls because this practice proved to be particularly effective for improving sports performance. In the 1980s doping tests at Olympic events became more widespread and effective. A symposium to face this problem was held in Leipzig on June 24, 1981. In the ensuing years nasal spray preparations containing testosterone or androstenedione were developed in collaboration with Jenapharm, tested, and used in top athletes‚Äîsome of whom did not like this mode of application. Doping tests at the time used the T:E (testosterone:epitestosterone) ratio. Since 1983, Jenapharm had produced preparations of epitestosterone propionate, a biologically inactive compound that had no commercial value but was prepared exclusively for the governmental doping system. It was used simultaneously or sequentially with testosterone injections to bring the T:E ratio back into the normal range, but only for athletes participating in international competitions. This protocol made it possible for female athletes to receive high testosterone dosages and still pass doping tests, but it had strong virilizing effects, in particular hirsutism and voice changes. Concomitant consumption of alcohol or contraceptive pills led to severe and sometimes life-threatening liver damage. In male weight lifters cases of gynecomastia had to be resolved by surgery. All these side effects, as well the athletic improvements were meticulously documented in reports to the Stasi. In 2005 some 160 former athletes, facing spiraling medical costs from the long term side effects of anabolic steroids, sued Jenapharm. Some of the female athletes had suffered multiple miscarriages. Many of the former athletes did not qualify for state medical insurance because they have been too ill to work. Initially Jenapharm denied responsibility for their condition, arguing that Oral Turinabol had been legally approved in the GDR and available on the market, but was misused by sports physicians and trainers. Lawyers representing the athletes argued that research from files left behind by Stasi secret police showed that Jenapharm also passed non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about their side effects, thereby breaking the law. Another argument brought by the athletes was that Jenapharm manufactured substances that had no use other than doping, and that the government pressure in East Germany was not so great that company were unable to refuse engaging in doping-related activities. Eventually, the German Olympic Sports Federation (DOSB), the legal successor to the former East German National Olympic Committee, compensated each athlete with ‚Ç¨9,250 ($12,200). Jenapharm contributed to the $4.1 million fund. About $500,000 were set aside for future claims.

Some versions are suitable for a wide range of general building uses and for applications that require fire resistance, mold and mildew control, as well as sound control applications and many other benefits. As an environmentally friendly building material, magnesia board has strength and resistance due to very strong bonds between magnesium and oxygen atoms that form magnesium oxide crystals (with the chemical formula MgO). Magnesia boards are used in place of traditional gypsum drywall as wall and ceiling covering material and sheathing. It is also used in a number of other construction applications such as fascias, soffit, shaft-liner and area separation, wall sheathing, and as tile backing (backer board) or as substrates for coatings and insulated systems such as finish systems, EIFS, and some types of stucco. Magnesia cement board for building construction is available is various sizes and thickness. It is not a paperfaced material. It generally comes in a light gray, white or beige color. Numerous versions and value of grades exist including smooth face, rough texture, utility, versatile grades as well as different densities and strengths for different applications and uses. Presently various magnesia cement boards are widely used in Asia as a primary construction material. Some versions have been designated as the ‚Äòofficial‚Äô construction specified material of the 2008 Summer Olympics and some versions are used extensively on the inside and outside of all the walls, fireproofing beams, and as the sub-floor sheathing in one of the world's tallest buildings, Taipei 101, located in Taipei, Taiwan. Magnesia cement is manufactured in a number of areas around the world, primarily near areas where magnesia based ore (periclase) deposits are mined. Major deposits are found in China, Europe, and Canada.Periclase at Mindat Magnesia ore deposits in the US are negligible. Estimates put the use of magnesia board products at around 8 million ft¬≤ in Asia alone. It is gaining popularity in the US, particularly near coastal regions. History *Magnesia cement uses in masonry construction is ancient. It was used primarily as a mortar component and stabilizer for soil bricks. Magnesia has also been identified in the Great Wall of China and other ancient landmarks. Roman cement is reported to have contained high levels of magnesia. *In the West, Portland cement replaced magnesia for masonry uses in the 20th century when energy was cheap (see energy efficiency) and mold infection was poorly understood. *However, some projects continued to use magnesia. New York City's Brooklyn Bridge base is made from locally mined cement, a mixture of calcium oxide and magnesia cement commonly called Rosendale cement, the only natural non-fired cement made in the US. *Magnesia cement boards were approved for construction use in the US around 2003. *Due to its fire resistance and safety ratings, New York and New Jersey were early adopters of magnesia cement board manufactured by Dragon Board in early 2010. Florida has adopted magnesia boards for mold/mildew resistance. Innova Eco Building System obtained the first approvals for structural uses of a magnesium board structural insulated panel. The magnesia board panels are load bearing, hurricane and impact tested magnesia cement structural insulated panels, obtaining a Miami Dade NOA certification for the high velocity hurricane wind zones of Florida, +180 mph winds. . *Located in Taipei, Taiwan, magnesia board can be found on all 101 stories of Taipei 101, currently the eighth tallest building in the world. Magnesia sheeting was used on the inside and outside of all the walls, fireproofing beams and as the sub-floor sheathing. Purpose and use Magnesia is widely used primarily as wallboard alternative to conventional gypsum-based drywall and plywoods. The magnesia boards can be scored and snapped, sawed, drilled, and fastened to wood or steel framing. Magnesia boards are a good example of the advances made in construction materials to meet changes in building codes for safety and durability . Applications *Interior wall and ceiling board *Exterior wall and fencing board *Exterior sheathing *Trim materials *Fascias *Soffits *Shaft-liner and area separation wall board *Tile backing (backer board) and underlayment *Substrates for coatings and insulated systems such as direct-applied finish systems, EIFS, SIPS, Portland type stucco and synthetic stuccos. Advantages *Ratings and testing: **Fire-resistant (UL 055 and ASTM-tested and A-rated) **Water- resistant (freeze/thaw-tested for 36 months) **Mold/fungus/bug free (non- nutritious to mold, fungus, insects ASTM G-21) **Impact-resistant (ASTM D-5628) **NYC approved (MEA # 359-02-M) **Silica/asbestos free **STC-rated 53-54 *Can be used in the place of traditional drywall or cement boards. No special tools required. *Hard non-absorbent surface ‚Äì using fibreglass backing ‚Äì with no paper. *Can be used in applications like cement-based siding subject to using water-proof coating systems. *Available in colors. *Energy efficient ‚Äì magnesite calcines at approx 780 Celsius, compared to over 1,400 Celsius required to form traditional Portland cement or calcium oxide, the starting material for the preparation of slaked lime or portlandite used in common mortar and plaster. *Magnesia boards have been mentioned in articles about biologically friendly construction and risks of mold infection. *Comparable in cost to cement board made from Portland cement, with numerous advantages over that material for wet applications. Disadvantages *Natural deposits of magnesium carbonate (Magnesite ore) occur in China and this is calcined to produce magnesium oxide. Local governments there prohibit the exportation of the raw materials for manufacturing outside China.China Expands Scope of Prohibited Category under Export Processing Trade *Little mining of magnesium based minerals occurs in the United States or Europe, and is not thought profitable other than for higher value ceramic applications such as refractory brick preparations (so called magnesia refractories). Most building projects involving low cost MgO board will inevitably rely on Chinese or Indian materials. *In most cases, good quality magnesia board is more expensive than paperfaced gypsum drywall material. *Like all cement mixtures, magnesia cements and related mixing recipes and equipment require strict controls in both the raw material going into the mixer, as well as the curing process and proper waiting time for setting and handling of the fresh and semi-fresh product. Many cheaper brands achieve high early strength using magnesium oxychloride cement technologies, which make the board more susceptible to water weakening and inconsistent material. *Several different producers exist, with big differences in their production and selling costs, which greatly impacts on the mix design and curing process. This makes each brand very different in potential uses. Even though the different brands may look and feel similar, caution must be used when selecting the versions and brands for specific use since they are not all the same or usable in the same way. [?reference] *Boards tend to have quite unique installation requirements. Each version of magnesia board needs to be installed using the manufacturer's recommendations to avoid installation problems. *Most often the boards are produced by using Sorel cement (Magnesium oxychloride), resulting in a slightly hygroscopic product that can produce a problem called \\"crying boards\\" when applied in too humid climate. Example: Dokk1. *The chloride in Sorel cement is relatively immobile, but in some cases can produce a corrosive environment for embedded fasteners and steel studs.

Wilson played once for Scotland, in 1975. His football career peaked in season 1974‚Äì75 after being moved to play as a striker when he scored 29 goals for Celtic, including two in that season's Scottish Cup final win. He was selected to play for Scotland that season, making him the only non-white player to represent the full Scotland team in the 20th century, and the first footballer with Asian origins to have represented any of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland at senior level. Following his mother's death, his enthusiasm for football diminished before he left the professional game at the age of 29. Early years Wilson was born in Bangalore, India. His Scottish father was stationed there with the Royal Air Force, where he met Wilson's Dutch- Portuguese mother. The family moved to Scotland when Wilson was one year old, living first in the Dennistoun district of Glasgow then in the town of Milngavie in the northern outskirts. CareerClub= Celtic manager Jock Stein signed Wilson for the club in 1967 and immediately farmed him out to Junior club, Maryhill, to gain experience before returning to Celtic. Wilson was part of a group of young players named the Quality Street Gang by the Scottish media. He was one of many in that group who gradually replaced Celtic's Lisbon Lions team which had won the 1967 European Cup Final. Wilson's senior debut was in a European Cup 9‚Äì0 win at Celtic Park against KPV Kokkola in 1970 in which he scored twice. Wilson was a quick footballer able to shoot with either foot. He was largely deployed by Stein on the wing where he felt Wilson's pace would be useful. Wilson disliked playing wide, preferring to play more centrally. He had dark skin tone and received racist abuse in his football career during Old Firm games against rivals Rangers and from supporters of his own club. Wilson became a first team regular in August 1973. He ended season 1973‚Äì74 in Scottish football with a league winners' medal but did not feature in the squad for the 1974 Scottish Cup Final, a 3‚Äì0 win over Dundee United. Stein moved the fast and elegant Wilson to play up front for the 1974‚Äì75 season where he outscored his friend and strike partner, Kenny Dalglish, with 29 goals. This culminated with Wilson scoring two headed goals in the 3‚Äì1 victory over Airdrie in the 1975 Scottish Cup Final. This was also the season he was selected to play for Scotland. Wilson's mother died in the week leading up to the final against Airdrie. He later stated his mother's death was the source of his waning enthusiasm for football. This was not helped by a niggling injury requiring cortisone injections. Wilson did though collect a second championship winning medal in 1976‚Äì77 when he had been a regular until Alfie Conn joined in March that season. Wilson remained at Celtic until 1978 when he was out of favour under Billy McNeill's management. At Celtic he made 226 appearances in all competitions, scoring 62 goals including six in matches against Rangers. Next Wilson moved to Motherwell for one season.Paul Wilson, MotherWELLnet He then finished his senior career at the end of the 1980 season with Partick Thistle at the age of 29. After his spell at Thistle he was tempted into junior football by ex-Celtic teammate Jimmy Johnstone with Blantyre Celtic, winning a junior international cap. =International= Wilson gained one international cap for Scotland. On 5 February 1975, Willie Ormond sent him on as a 75th-minute substitute for Kenny Burns in a European Championship qualifier. The 1‚Äì1 draw was against Spain in Valencia in which Joe Jordan had put the Scots ahead.Scotland - International Matches 1971-1975 RSSSF Wilson remarked, \\"I nearly scored but their keeper just got his hands to my effort. I was as sick as a dog. I was so proud to get my one cap.\\" Andrew Watson collected three full caps in the 1880s.

Rayat ash-Shaghilah was founded in 1953 by a group that had been expelled from the Iraqi Communist Party. Its main spokesperson was Jamal al-Haidari.Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. pp. 44-45 Rayat ash-Shaghilah was the largest communist splinter-group in Iraq at the time.Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. p. 60 Split in the Iraqi Communist Party In 1952 the Iraqi Communist Party had adopted a new party programme, which was more radical in its call for action than the programme in use during Fahd's leadership. The new party programme called for nationalization of oil industry, eradication of British interests and the formation of a unified popular front under communist leadership. The core of the Rayat ash-Shaghilah consisted of al-Haidari, Aziz Muhammad, Abd us-Salam al-Nasiri and Zaki Khairi, who had criticized the positions of the new party programme whilst in prison and had subsequently been expelled from the party by the party leader Basim. Several other Communist Party members, who were seen as supportive of the dissidents, were also expelled. Amongst them was Abd ur-Razzak as-Safi. In February 1953 the Communist Party main organ, al-Qaidah, denounced the dissidents as 'opportunists and subversives'. Moreover, al-Qaidah made the names of the dissidents public, thus revealing their identities to the police. In response, the dissidents launched the eponymous publication. The Iraqi Communist Party would continue to attack Rayat ash-Shaghilah group throughout 1953-1954 and names of Rayat ash-Shaghilah members continued to be publicized in al-Qaidah. Rejecting the dissidents, al-Qaidah branded the group as 'royalists, deviationists and destructive' and collaborators of the security police. International profile Internationally, the group proclaimed its loyalty to the Soviet Union. The group sought recognition from the World Communist Movement as the legitimate representative of the Iraqi communist movement, thus challenging the international position of the Iraqi Communist Party. Rayat ash-Shaghilah sent its own delegation to the 5th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Warsaw, Poland, in 1955. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union did however not recognize the group and continued to identify it as a splinter-group. Merger with the Iraqi Communist Party In mid-1955 Salam Adil became the new general secretary of the Iraqi Communist Party. Rapidly, he undertook moves towards unity with various dissident groups. On July 22, 1955, Adil presented a proposal to Rayat ash-Shaghilah for unification into the Communist Party. The proposal consisted of four points. Rayat ash-Shaghilah responded that they were positive in principle. However, they continued to publish political assaults on al-Qaidah. In March 1956, the Iraqi Communist Party issued a public appeal to all splinter-groups to return to the party. The appeal specifically mentioned Rayat ash-Shaghilah, stating that reasons for their departure from the party had ceased to be relevant after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In April 1956 another faction, the Unity of Communists of Iraq, merged with the Communist Party. That merger speedied up the merger talks between the Communist Party and Rayat ash-Shaghilah. The unification between the two groups finally took place in June 1956, after a series of negotiations facilitated by the Syrian communist leader Khalid Bakdash. The last issue of Rayat ash-Shaghilah was published in mid-June 1956, in which the group expressed self-criticism over having acting divisively in the communist movement. The Communist Party on its behalf also regretted its actions during the split, claiming that the 1952 expulsions had been 'childish and bureaucratic'.

As a pioneer Texas geologist, Hill discovered and named the Comanche Series of the Lower Cretaceous, and was a lifelong student of the structure and stratigraphy of the Cretaceous deposits of Central Texas and neighboring regions. Biography Robert T. Hill was born on 11 August 1858 in Nashville, Tennessee. He was orphaned at the age of five during the American Civil War and then raised in the home of his grandmother. In 1874, at the age of 16, Hill boarded a train and traveled to where the tracks ended in east Waco, Texas. From there he found his way to the frontier town of Comanche, Texas, located to the west of Waco where he joined his brother, Joe, the editor of The Comanche Chief newspaper. Robert worked as a printer for the newspaper and performed various other duties including writing, bookbinding, and eventually became co-editor of the paper. During the summer of 1876, Hill joined a survey crew headed to the rolling plains between the eastern edge of the Llano Estacado and Fort Griffin, Texas. The work, although somewhat tedious at times, provided an opportunity for Hill to explore the ‚Äúredbed country‚Äù of west-central Texas. This land of reddish brown sediments and rock has been carved by years of erosion leaving behind scenic mesas and buttes that preserve clues to the regions geologic past. In 1877, at the age of 19, Hill accepted an offer to work as a cowboy driving a large herd of cattle from Uvalde, Texas, to Dodge City, Kansas. The cattle drive took many months, during which time he learned to live outdoors for extended periods and developed frontier skills that would prove valuable in later years as he worked as a field geologist.Alexander, N. 1976. Father of Texas Geology: Robert T. Hill. Dallas: Southern Methodist University Press, 317 pp. Returning to work again at The Comanche Chief newspaper, Hill began to spend idle time exploring the local terrain. His interest in geology grew as he took special interest in the many flat-topped mesas and buttes in the region. One butte in particular, named Round Mountain, was located only to the northwest of Comanche and he often climbed to the top to enjoy the view. Although he had little knowledge of geology at this point, he found the fossils along its rocky slopes to be fascinating and he began to collect specimens. Hill‚Äôs collection of fossils grew and soon cluttered the windowsills and filled the corners of the newspaper office. Through a friend, Hill obtained a copy of Wilson‚Äôs Fifth Reader that contained chapters on various subjects, including a chapter on geology. Hill studied this book and the more he learned the more he wanted to know about geology. He then ordered, through his local drug store, a copy of the Manual of Geology by James Dwight Dana, one of the leading geologists in North America. Hill carefully studied this book and attempted to place the local stratigraphy into Dana‚Äôs scheme of classification. It became apparent that he was dealing with rocks and fossils that had not as yet been described by modern science. This discovery propelled Hill into a lifelong interest in the Cretaceous period ‚Äì a period when Central Texas was covered by a shallow sea. At some point Hill recognized that the next logical step in his pursuit of geological knowledge was to attend university and obtain a proper education. Through his newspaper connections, Hill found acceptance at Cornell University, which allowed students to take a light course load and work their way through school. In February 1882, Hill left Comanche for Ithaca, New York, to study geology at Cornell. From 1882 through 1885 he worked his way through Cornell University, where he received a B.S. degree in geology in 1887.

Hill first observed Lower Cretaceous fossils and strata. () (30 December 2008) Scientific career In the 1880s, trained geologists were in demand from governments and business. The United States Geological Survey was established in 1879 and John Wesley Powell had become director in 1881. Powell hired Hill in 1885 to work at the National Museum of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. After a year of being assigned menial tasks such as the preparation of the Survey‚Äôs fossil collections, Hill was assigned to a three-month field season in his beloved Texas, a period that would provide an opportunity to revisit the Cretaceous deposits of west-central Texas. He traversed portions of the state underlain by Cretaceous deposits accompanied by William Fletcher Cummins of Dallas, another geologist that would prove to be an influential figure in early Texas geology. In 1887, Hill published a 95-page report titled The Present Condition of Knowledge of the Geology of Texas. Although this report was primarily prepared as an undergraduate thesis at Cornell University, it was also published as a Bulletin of the United States Geological Survey.Hill, R.T. 1887. The present condition of knowledge of the geology of Texas. United States Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Bulletin 45, 95 pp. Also in 1887, Hill managed to publish a number of important papers in The American Journal of Science on his findings with regard to the Cretaceous of Texas. Publication of The topography and geology of the Cross Timbers and surrounding regions in Northern Texas, established Hill as the first to recognize the twofold subdivision of the Cretaceous System.Hill, R.T. 1887.

The names that he introduced ‚Äì the Comanche Series applied to the Lower Cretaceous (named after his adopted home town of Comanche, Texas) and the Gulf Series applied to the Upper Cretaceous ‚Äì remain the standard for stratigraphic nomenclature in the western Gulf Coast region.Hill, R.T. and Vaughn, T.W. 1898. The Lower Cretaceous Gryph√¶as of the Texas Region. United States Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Bulletin 151, 66 pp. Throughout the rest of Hill‚Äôs professional career he would continue to publish numerous articles focused on various aspects of the Cretaceous Period. In 1888, Hill was invited to fill a newly formed chair of geology at the University of Texas at Austin. Here he would have the opportunity to teach the first courses in geology ever offered in the state of Texas and build a geology department in a new but already prestigious university. However, it was not to last as Hill returned to Washington and the United States Geological Survey and began an appointment with the Artesian and Underflow Investigation in 1890.Manning, T.G. 1977.

In October 1899, Hill led a six-man expedition to explore and document the canyons of the Rio Grande. Traveling in three boats, the expedition took nearly an entire month to travel from Presidio to Langtry, Texas. Hill packed photography equipment into the boats, and took a series of photographs, both during and after his river voyage. Two years later, Hill published an article describing his voyage, and describing the Big Bend region in the colorful language of the period.

In addition to being a composer, he was also a member of the butcher's guild in the Plze≈à. Madelka published two music collections.  Biography  Madelka may have come from Opole, as suggested by the cognomen Oppolensis, preserved in the collection of his music. The surname Madelka was also quite common both in Silesia and Opole. He came to Western Bohemia probably in consequence of culmination of the reformation wave in Opole Region in the middle of the 16th century. Madelka was a Catholic, and his religion may have been the main reason for his changing residences. In 1575 he was entered to the register of the butcher's guild in Plze≈à, and in 1580 became a master butcher. In 1585 he became the member of the guild's board of elders. He died probably during the epidemic of a plague that killed 1300 to 1600 citizens of Plze≈à in 1598. His name appears in the manuscripts exclusively as ≈†imon Bariona; the other variants of his name, Bar Jona and Madelka figure only in his printed music. He is mentioned in various musical sources with other European composers such as Clemens non Papa, Jacobus Vaet, Thomas Crecquillon, Michael de Buissons and Orlando Lasso. He was the contemporary of Jacobus Gallus, Jan Simonides Montanus, Pavel Spongopaeus Jistebnick√Ω, Ond≈ôej Chrysoponus Jev√≠ƒçsk√Ω, and Jan Traj√°n Turnovsk√Ω. His compositions number thirty five sacral works, but only one of them is well preserved: the collection of Seven Penitential Psalms, published in 1586 by German printer Nicholas Knorr in Altdorf bei N√ºrnberg. His second published composition, printed by Ji≈ô√≠ Nigrin in Prague, as well as the rest of his output, is preserved only in fragments. His first printed composition, Canticum Beatissimae virginis Mariae, was published in Prague in 1578. It was dedicated to the Abbot of Tepl√°, Jan Mausk√∂nig.

He was a leading member of the All India Muslim League and a trusted lieutenant of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, serving in the Interim Government of India of 1946 as a Member of the Central Legislative Assembly of India.Page 257 & 344 After independence of Pakistan in 1947, he became the minister of Food, Agriculture and Health in the Government of Pakistan and finally a diplomat for Pakistan in many countries from 1948 to 1957. Early life and career Ghazanfar Ali Khan's father's name was Saif Ali Khan. A Khokhar Rajput from Pind Dadan Khan in Jhelum district, Ghazanfar Ali was an uncle of Pir Syed Fazal Shah of Jalalpur Sharif, another powerful and influential figure in the region during the Pakistan Movement. Ghazanfar completed his high school education at Jhelum and then went on to Government College, Lahore. Ghazanfar Ali Khan joined the Unionist Party in 1923 because he had political ambitions and was a prominent figure in Muslim politics by 1927, when he attended a conference, comprising 30 significant Muslim leaders, that resulted in the \\"Delhi Muslim Proposals\\" which attempted to address constitutional development but were ultimately thwarted by the recommendations of the 1928 Nehru Report. He persuaded his nephew to support his career in politics and this brought with it support from those who favoured his nephew Pir Fazal Shah himself. He stood in the 1937 provincial elections to the Punjab Legislative Assembly as a candidate of the All-India Muslim League and won this election to become a member of Punjab Legislative Assembly from 1937 to 1945.http://www.findpk.com/pof/raja_ghazanfar_ali_khan.html, Profile and commemorative postage stamp image of Raja Ghazanfar Ali Khan on findpk.com website, Retrieved 9 February 2017 But then deserted the Muslim League in favour of the Unionist Party after being offered a position as a parliamentary secretary by Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana. He supported the pact arranged at Lucknow between Sikandar Hayat Khan and Muhammad Ali Jinnah in October 1937, believing that the nationalist movement had suffered greatly from internal divisions and that a political party that united the aspirant Hindu and Muslim nationalist communities might prove more effective. In 1944, he returned to the League fold after the split between Khizar Hayat Tiwana and Jinnah, realising that the League was likely to get the upper hand. His uncle and local supporters followed him through these various manoeuvres. In the February 1946 provincial elections, Khan was a candidate for the League in the Pind Dadan Khan constituency 77 and won the election for Muslim League. In October of that year, he was among the five men nominated by Jinnah on behalf of the League to join the interim Government of India, in which he subsequently took the Minister of Food, Agriculture and Health portfolio. The other four nominated by the League were Liaquat Ali Khan, I. I. Chundrigar, Abdur Rab Nishtar and Jogendra Nath Mandal. He said of the League's involvement that \\"We are going into the interim government to get a foothold to fight for our cherished goal of Pakistan\\". After the Partition of India, Khan became Pakistan's Minister for Food, Agriculture and Health. He was minister for refugees and rehabilitation in 1948, during a period when there was much controversy regarding the movement of Muslim people between the now- divided India and Pakistan. In 1948, he became the first president of the newly formed Pakistan Hockey Federation and served for 2 years in that position (1948-1950).http://www.pakistanhockeyfederation.com/history , Raja Ghazanfar Ali Khan served as President, Pakistan Hockey Federation (1948-1950), Retrieved 10 February 2017 From 1948 to 1957, he took to a new career as a diplomat.

He is most well known for his publication of The First Industrial Nation: an Economic History of Britain 1700‚Äì1914 (1969), which discussed not only the multiple factors that made industrialisation possible, but also how it was sustained. Early life and education Mathias was born in Freshford, Somerset to Jack Mathias (from Plymouth) and Marion (n√©e) Love (from Wingfield). He attended Colston's School and Bristol Grammar School where he became interested in history. In December 1945, he applied for a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge; instead he won an Exhibition at Jesus College, Cambridge during Summer 1946. However the college demanded that those coming up from school should have done military service before they arrived so he spent two years in the army as a conscript. At Cambridge, his tutor was the medievalist, Vivian Fisher, and the English economic historian, Charles Wilson. Mathias also spent the 1952‚Äì3 academic year at Harvard University, participating in the Research Center for Entrepreneurial History. Academic career He was elected a Research Fellow at Jesus College, Cambridge, when he published his first book on the brewing industry in England. The manuscript described the importance of the technical aspects of brewing and manufacturing to the developing of the industry as a whole. Mathias then went out to complete a textbook on the history of industrialisation in Britain, The First Industrial Nation (1969). He was Fellow of Queens‚Äô College, Cambridge from 1955 to 1968, and later an Honorary Fellow from 1987. He was Chichele Professor of Economic History at the University of Oxford and Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. There, he was editor of the Cambridge Economic History of Europe and co-founded of The Journal of European Economic History. He left Oxford to become Master of Downing College, Cambridge from 1987 to 1995. Outside of research and teaching, Mathias contributed to the academic community with his positions at the Economic History Society (EHS) and the International Economic History Association (IEHA). He joined the former in his final year of undergraduate work at Cambridge. He continued to work for the EHS as Reviews Editor, Assistant Editor (1955‚Äì), Treasurer (1968‚Äì88), and President (1989‚Äì92). Meanwhile, the IEHA emerged from conferences at the University of Stockholm, but expanded in the 1960s. Mathias also became a member of the Datini Institute in Prato, Italy in 1967, under the direction of Fernand Braudel and Federigo Melis. Later life After retiring in 1995, he continued on advising and researching. He was the international advisor to Keio University, Japan, and President of the Great Britain Sasakawa Foundation. For this work, he was granted the Order of the Rising Sun with Gold Rays in 2003. In 1998, Mathias' Festschrift, From Family Firms to Corporate Capitalism: Essays in Business and Industrial History in Honour of Peter Mathias was published by his former students, Kristine Bruland and Patrick O'Brien. Another Festschrift was published in 2018 entitled Asia and the history of the international economy : essays in memory of Peter Mathias, edited by A. J. H. Latham and Heita Kawakatsu.

Barrie, and was active from 1890 to 1913. The team was named by Barrie, both after himself and in the mistaken belief that 'Allah akbar' meant 'Heaven help us' in Arabic (rather than 'God is great').Chaney, Lisa, Hide-and-Seek with Angels - A Life of J. M. Barrie (London: Arrow Books, 2005) Notable figures to have featured for the side included Rudyard Kipling, H. G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, P. G. Wodehouse,Wodehouse: A Life G. K.

Lucas, Maurice Hewlett, Owen Seaman, Bernard Partridge, Augustine Birrell, Paul Du Chaillu, Henry Herbert La Thangue, George Cecil Ives, and George Llewelyn Davies, as well as the son of Alfred Tennyson. Barrie wrote a 40-page book on his team, Allahakbarries C.C., which was published privately in 1890 and in a revised version in 1899. It was reprinted in 1950 with a foreword by Donald Bradman. These rare books are now highly sought by collectors. Barrie's enthusiasm for the game eclipsed his talent for it; asked to describe his bowling, he replied that after delivering the ball he would go and sit on the turf at mid-off and wait for it to reach the other end which 'it sometimes did'. The team played for the love of the game, rather than the results it achieved, and Barrie was generous in his praise for his teammates and opposition alike. He praised one teammate's performance by observing that 'You scored a good single in the first innings but were not so successful in the second' while he lauded the opposition's effort by pointing out how 'You ran up a fine total of 14, and very nearly won'. He instructed Bernard Partridge, an illustrator from Punch magazine who was afflicted with a lazy eye, to 'Keep your eye on square leg' while bowling and told square-leg, 'when Partridge is bowling, keep your eye on him.' He forbade his team to practise on an opponent's ground before a match because 'this can only give them confidence'.

It is distinguished by a thick-orange red slip over a slightly granular fabric. Interior surfaces are completely covered, while the exterior can be only partially slipped, particularly on later examples. By the 3rd century AD, African red slip appears on sites throughout the Mediterranean and in the major cities of Roman Europe. It was the most widely distributed representative of the sigillata tradition in the late-Roman period, and occasional imports have been found as far afield as Britain in the 5th-6th centuries.Tyers 1996, pp.80-82 African red slip ware was still widely distributed in the 5th century but after that time the volume of production and trade may well have declined. While the latest forms continued into the 7th century and are found in such major cities as Constantinople and Marseille, the breakup of commercial contacts that typified the later 7th century coincides with the final decline of the African red slip industry. The production and success of African red slip is probably closely tied to the agricultural productivity of Rome's North African provinces, as indicated in part by the contemporaneous distribution of Roman-period North African amphoras. Vessel forms Moulded Mithras slaying the bull, from Lavinium near Rome, 400 ¬± 50 From about the 4th century, competent copies of the fabric and forms were also made in several other regions, including Asia Minor, the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt. Over the long period of production, there was obviously much change and evolution in both forms and fabrics. Both Italian and Gaulish plain forms influenced ARS in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD (for example, Hayes Form 2, the cup or dish with an outcurved rim decorated with barbotine leaves, is a direct copy of the samian forms Dr.35 and 36, made in South and Central Gaul),Hayes 1972, p. 19‚Äì20. but over time a distinctive ARS repertoire developed. There was a wide range of dishes and bowls, many with rouletted or stamped decoration, and closed forms such as tall ovoid flagons with appliqu√© ornament (Hayes Form 171). The ambitious large rectangular dishes with relief decoration in the centre and on the wide rims (Hayes Form 56), were clearly inspired by decorated silver platters of the 4th century, which were made in rectangular and polygonal shapes as well as in the traditional circular form. Surface decoration Stamped Dionisos, 550-600 Jug with scenes of Orpheus, 3rd century A wide range of bowls, dishes and flagons were made in ARS, but the technique of making entire relief- decorated vessels in moulds was discontinued.For the detailed typology and distribution maps, see Hayes 1972 and Hayes 1980 Instead, appliqu√© motifs were frequently used where decoration in relief was required, separately made and applied to the vessel before drying and firing. Stamped motifs were also a favoured form of decoration, and decorative motifs reflected not only the Graeco-Roman traditions of the Mediterranean, but eventually the rise of Christianity as well: there is a great variety of monogram crosses and plain crosses amongst the stamps in the later centuries. Similar forms and fabrics were made for more local distribution in Egypt, which had its own very active and diverse ceramic traditions in the Roman period. Surface decoration of ARS is relatively simple during the first three centuries of production, with occasional rouletting, barbotine motifs and some appliqu√© being typical. In the 4th century applied decoration becomes common. By the 5th century stamped central motifs such as animals, crosses and humans are common on larger plates. Paralleling developments in other visual media, gladiatorial scenes and references to pagan mythology come to be replaced by Christian figures. In the last phase of production, surface treatment consists of light spiral burnishing on some plates and rouletting around the floor of certain bowls. Main typologies In 1972 John Hayes published a type series running from form 1 to 200, with forms 112-120 remaining unused.Hayes, John. (1972). Late Roman Pottery. London: British School at Rome (hardcover, ) A supplement appeared in 1980.Hayes, John. 1980. A Supplement to Late Roman Pottery. London: British School at Rome In addition to other previous work, Hayes made use of Waage's work in both Antioch and the Athenian Agora, as well as Lamboglia's in Ventimiglia. Michael Fulford's publication of the British excavations at Avenue du Pr√©sident Habib Bourguiba, Salammbo in Carthage expanded on the work of Hayes.Fulford, Michael & Peacock, David. (1984). The Avenue du President Habib Bourguiba, Salammbo: the pottery and other ceramic objects from the site excavations at Carthage. (The British Mission 1.2.) Sheffield: University of Sheffield, Department of Prehistory and Archaeology. Carandini's typology, published in Enciclopedia dell'arte antica classica e orientale, is also important.1981\\\\.

Michael Mackensen offers an alternate typology for later forms based on his work in northern Tunisia.Mackensen, Michael (1993).

(British Archaeological Reports International Series 1301) Oxford: B. A. R. Centers of Production Some major ARS centres in central Tunisia are Sidi Marzouk Tounsi, Henchir el-Guellal (Djilma), and Henchir es- Srira, all of which have ARS lamp artifacts attributed to them by the microscopic chemical makeup of the clay fabric as well as macroscopic style prevalent in that region.

Northwich, Cheshire - 17 January 2011) served in the British Army during World War II. After being captured at Tobruk, he became a Prisoner of War and was imprisoned at E715, an Allied POW camp attached to Auschwitz III (Monowitz), a sub-camp of the notorious Auschwitz.Rushton, Colin 'Spectator in Hell' Pharaoh Press (1998) BiographyEarly life= Dodd's father served in the British Army during the Boer War and was a Sergeant during World War I when he was captured. Dodd left school in 1934 aged 15, and became an apprentice mechanic for a motor transport company in his native Northwich, moving to the Weaver Navigation Company in 1937. In September 1938, he nearly lost his left foot when it became trapped between a ramp and a turning wheel. He received extensive physiotherapy for his injuries, but still only received a rating of 'B2' when he tried to enlist into the Army, too low to allow him to join up. However, as he had an HGV licence, he was permitted to enlist as a military driving instructor for the Royal Army Service Corps. =Military Service= At the beginning of World War II, Dodd served as a volunteer in France and was involved in the Dunkirk evacuation. Later, he was posted to North Africa and was in action at Tobruk. After Tobruk, Dodd, and an injured colleague, were captured by the enemy at Badir in the Western Desert. After being held in a number of ordinary Italian POW camps, in 1943, he was transferred to Auschwitz III (Monowitz) labour camp, only five miles away from the better-known extermination camp of Auschwitz II (Birkenau). Monowitz was under the direction of the industrial company IG Farben, who were building a Buna (synthetic rubber) and liquid fuel plant there, and housed over 10,000 Jewish slave labourers, as well as PoWs and forced labourers from all over occupied Europe. =Auschwitz III (Monowitz)= IG Farben factory in Monowitz (near Auschwitz) When Dodd and the POWs disembarked they noticed dozens of bundles of clothing that had just been left by the rail tracks.Dodd on the Axis History Forum website As they were marched to the concentration camp and factory where they would be working, Dodd tells of a teenage Jewish girl, stripped to the waist, who he says was being savagely whipped by an SS officer. Dodd and the other POWs attempted to get between him and the bleeding girl. The SS officer pulled out his pistol and threatened to shoot Dodd, who was at the front, if he interfered further. A Wehrmacht soldier warned Dodd that he meant what he said. The British troops stepped aside and the officer resumed his task of beating the girl. The filth of Camp E715,The British Connection to Auschwitz: Work Camp E715 and the IG Farben Chemical Plant, 1943-1945 with its accompanying smell of burning flesh from the crematorium at nearby Auschwitz II, was to be Dodd's home for the next 14 months. During his imprisonment in Camp E715, Dodd said he witnessed the mistreatment and killing of Jewish inmates at the camp by their SS guards, including Jews hanging from the gallows in Auschwitz I and several pushed off high scaffolding. Some of the British POWs frequently put themselves in danger to try to get any scraps of food they could spare to the prisoners in the Jewish section. Others refused to help, believing that the Jewish inmates were simply being rightfully punished for some crime they must have committed. Forced to work, many POWs deliberately sabotaged the pipes they were working on by placing stones or blank flanges into the pipes. Suspicious, on one occasion, a German engineer ordered a pressure test on the pipes. Horrified, the POWs knew that not one single pipe would pass such a test and realised that they would be shot in no less than 20 minutes. As the test was being prepared, the air raid siren went off and they were ordered into the shelters. Dodd later said: > \\"We knew that they had found out what we had done. They had us lined up > against a wall to shoot us as soon as the pipes failed the test. I had just > said a prayer, when the air-raid siren went and everyone, guards and > prisoners, dived into the air raid shelters. We heard a bomb fall and when > the raid was over we saw that the only bomb to hit the factory had blown out > the wall where the pipes were. God was looking after us that day. Maybe John > Wesley had a hand in it as well.\\" When the air raid ended, the British troops were led out of the shelter and, to their relief, saw that the only building hit by a bomb had been the BAU 38 - the place where the pressure test was to take place. All of the pipes had been destroyed. During a further air raid on 20 August 1944, Dodd and other POWs were in a shelter which was hit by a bomb, killing 38 British POWs and injuring Dodd and others. These 38 POWs are commemorated on a plaque which was unveiled on the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, in 2005. Their remains were interred in the Krak√≥w Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery. In late 1944, the British POWs heard a noise outside their huts. On going outside to investigate, they saw about a thousand Jews, old men, women and children, walking towards Auschwitz II on the other side of the perimeter wire. The children were playing and singing as they passed. Once they had gone, the men returned to their huts in silence. They had been told in the past of the fate of such columns of walking Jews. =Freedom= On 23 January 1945, four days before Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army, in the coldest winter Poland had experienced for years, the British PoWs were given the option by their German guards to either start walking Eastwards towards the Russians or Westwards towards the Americans. Dodd chose the latter. In the weeks of walking during this 'Death March', when the temperature often dropped to minus 25 degrees, the walking men froze, and some starved to death. As they walked, they passed the partially snow-covered bodies of hundreds of dead Jews, some of whom had died from cold or their exertions, while others had clearly been shot. Those PoWs who had greatcoats, shared them, and they slept huddled together to stave off the cold. In the towns they passed, they witnessed the slaughter by the retreating Nazis. On reaching Regensburg in Germany, Dodd and his colleagues were finally liberated. After the War, Dodd worked for British Waterways in Northwich. On 21 September 1946, he married Olwen. They had two children, six grandchildren and ten great grandchildren. =Spectator in Hell= Dodd's story is told in the book Spectator in Hell by Colin Rushton, first published by Pharaoh Press in 1998 and subsequently republished by Summersdale Publishers Ltd in 2001 and 2005. His story was also told in the television documentaries Satan at His Best (1995)Wollheim Memorial website and in the BBC's Auschwitz: The Forgotten Witness (1997).Dodd on ABC TV OnlineBritish Film Institute entry In the latter programme, Dodd returned to Auschwitz to find the location of Camp E715, and tried unsuccessfully to gain admission to the IG Farben plant to claim the 14 months backwages he said they owed him for his forced wartime labour there. =Decline and death= In November 2009 it was reported in the Wirral News that, aged 90, Dodd was battling with Alzheimer's disease and required full-time care at a care home in Cheshire. A campaign was launched to raise the ¬£500 a week needed to cover the cost of his care.'Campaign to help Auschwitz death camp survivor' 8 June 2009 He died in the early hours of 17 January 2011 aged 91.

Operational history The division was raised in August 1939 as part of the fourth mobilisation wave, consisting of Bavarian soldiers from Wehkreis VII. It was placed under the command of Major General Erich Straube. Although formed during the preparation for the upcoming invasion of Poland, the 268th was initially stationed in the Saarland - the Franco-German border. During the Battle of France, the division was stationed with Lieutenant General Gotthard Heinrici's XII Corps, of the 1st Army. It was later moved to Poland in September 1940. In January, 1940, portions of the officer complements were moved to the newly activated 297th Infantry Division. In June of the same year, further significant portions of the 268th's officer complements were moved, this time to the 132nd Infantry Division. On June 1, 1941, its commanding officer, Straube, was promoted to Lieutenant General, as German forces prepared for Operation Barbarossa, which the division was to take part in. It was made a component of General of the Artillery Wilhelm Fahrmbacher's VII Army Corps, itself part of Army Group Centre's Second Army. The division took part in successful actions in the opening weeks, with the Brest Fortress being stormed and large portions of the Soviet Western Front being encircled at the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk. The 268th was present on 23 July as German forces attacked the Smolensk Pocket. As Soviet Field Marshal Semyon Timoshenko began to assemble forces for a counter-offensive, this put strain on both Heinz Guderian's 2nd and Hermann Hoth's 3rd Panzer Groups. As such, Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, commanding officer of Army Group Centre, had the division transferred under Guderian's command as part of XX Corps. The Corps' duty was to take control of the El'nia sector, which was to capture a bridgehead nearby. On July 26, a number of 2nd Army Group divisions were moved northward to reinforce Hoth's 3rd Panzer Group as it prepared to seal Soviet troops in Smolensk within a pocket - the 106th and 268th divisions arrived by 3 August, with another three arriving over the next three days. The Yelnya bridgehead was captured by August 8 and defended by XX Army Corps, relieving the 10th Panzer and the 2nd-SS Panzer Divisions, as the Soviets attempted another attack. In the following week, more than 2500 men in the Corps were killed, many of whom being of the division's battalion-level line officers. The 268th's participated in action near Yelnya at the end of August, leading to a (though minor) German withdrawal. As German forces attempted to attack Moscow with Operation Typhoon, the Red Army began to attack near Rzhev and Vyazma in November. In December it was assigned to XXIV Corps in the 2nd Panzer Army, and in January 1942 to XIII Corps in the 4th Army. In January 1942, Lieutenant General Straube was replaced as commanding officer by Major General Heinrich Greiner. In February 1942 it was assigned to XII Corps, with which it served until August 1943. In January 1943, Greiner was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General. The division sustained heavy losses during the Battle of Kursk, pulling back at diminished size to Bryansk and later Mogilev. It was after this that the division, reduced to a regimental-strength, was formerly disbanded as a division, after having been renamed \\"Division Group 268\\" and placed within the 36th Motorized Division. The divisional staff had already been moved to the newly formed 362nd Infantry Division.

Jaulian is located in Haripur District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the provincial border with Punjab and the city of Taxila. Jaulian, along with the nearby monastery at Mohra Muradu, form part of the Ruins of Taxila ‚Äì a collection of excavations that were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. Location Jaulian is located on a hill 100 metres above the nearby modern village of Jaulian. The cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad are approximately 35 km and 45 km to the southeast, respectively and situated near Khanpur Taxila road; a picnic place near Khanpur Dam. Jaulian is located near the Mohra Muradu monastery, and the ancient Taxilan city of Sirsukh. Moreover, Piplan Remains, Badalpur Stupa and Jinnah Wali Dheri Stupa are nearby places. History Jaulian was built by the Kushans in the 2nd century CE ‚Äì around the same time as the nearby Mohra Muradu Jaulian, along with the rest of Ancient Taxila, was devastated in the 450s CE during the invasion of the White Huns, and later abandoned. Subsequent rulers, such as the Hun King Mihirakula, persecuted the region's Buddhists, and the site never recovered. Excavations The ruins at Jaulian are situated on a hill top, and consist of: a main central stupa, 27 peripheral smaller stupas, 59 small chapels displaying scenes from the life of Buddha, and two quadrangles around which monastic living quarters were arranged. The form and building of Jaulian is similar to that of the nearby Mohra Muradu. =Main stupa= Remains of the main Stupa, and small peripheral Stupas The main stupa at Jaulian was much smaller than that of Mohra Muradu or the Dharmarajika Stupa, and is badly damaged. It was extensively coated in stucco plaster, as are almost all the sculptures and architectural details. Despite the use of an easily moldable material, the quality of decoration at Jaulian is considered to be less impressive than that of Mohra Muradu. The original plaster is preserved at some places. The main stupa is surrounded by 21 smaller \\"votive stupas\\" that contained religious iconography ‚Äì though some posit that some of the votive stupas were actually built as tombs for revered monks. The statues located in the votive stupas are mostly preserved; though a number of have been removed and are housed in museums.the original fabric of the main stupa itself which stands in the middle of the upper court A statue of Buddha in a votive stupa with a hole in the navel was called the \\"Healing Buddha\\". Pilgrims would put their fingers in the icon's navel, and pray for cures of various ailment. A 5th century inscription preserved under the statue shows that it was given by a friar Budhamitra Dharmanandin. =Monastery= Map of the Jaulian monastery and stupa area The monastery at Jaulian is similar to that of nearby Mohra Muradu. Jaulian monastery was a two-level building that contained 28 students' rooms on the first floor, and 28 more on the second floor. The two levels are connected by stone stairs which are still preserved. Some of the rooms contain preserved statues of the Buddha. Each room had a niche to hold lamps, and a window offering a source of fresh air and natural light. The windows were designed to be narrower at the outer edge, of and larger at the inner edge in order guard against wild animals. The rooms were plastered and decorated with plasterwork and paintings. As was common at other large monasteries in the Gandhara region such as Takht-i-Bahi and Dharmarajika, a section of the monastery was set aside specifically for the production of Buddhist manuscripts, typically on birch bark, a highly perishable material. The monastery further contained a large pool that was used for washing, and a kitchen. A stone for grinding spices is well- preserved at the site, as well as two stone mills that were used to grind grains. A statue of Buddha (at Jaulian) with a hole in the navel is an odd artifact. It is called the \\"Healing Buddha\\". Buddhist pilgrims put their fings in the navel hole and pray for the ailment of the patients.

A club cricketer in Weston-super-Mare, he played first for Somerset's first team as a right-handed middle-order batsman in June 1953 in a three-day non-first-class match against a Royal Air Force team that included Fred Trueman, top-scoring with 34 in the county's first innings and making 56 in the second innings, when Harold Gimblett got a century. He then made his first-class debut in a crushing two-day defeat by Glamorgan in which he failed to reach double figures in either innings. He was one of several batsmen who filled various batting positions across the middle of the summer in a very poor side, which finished bottom of the County Championship for the second year in succession. Only in his final innings, 42 against Essex at Weston-super-Mare, did he make much impact: his stand of 86 for the sixth wicket with Johnny Lawrence was deemed \\"spirited\\" by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, though Somerset were following on at the time and lost the match rather easily. His medium-pace bowling failed to take a wicket in eight overs in his first-class matches. In his life outside cricket, he was a chartered accountant in Weston-super-Mare.

Polytheism and mythology Titanide Eos pursues the object of her affection, the reluctant Tithonos, on an Attic oinochoe of the Achilles Painter, ca. 470 BC‚Äì460 BCE (Louvre) =Greek mythology= The Titanides, sisters and children of Titans, may not have originally been seen as giants, but later Hellenistic poets and Latin ones tended to blur Titans and Giants. In a surviving fragment of Naevius' poem on the Punic war, he describes the Gigantes Runcus and Purpureus (Porphyrion): :Inerant signa expressa, quo modo Titani :bicorpores Gigantes, magnique Atlantes :Runcus ac Purpureus filii Terras. Eduard Fraenkel remarks of these lines, with their highly unusual plural Atlantes, \\"It does not surprise us to find the names Titani and Gigantes employed indiscriminately to denote the same mythological creatures, for we are used to the identification, or confusion, of these two types of monsters which, though not original, had probably become fairly common by the time of Naevius\\".Fraenkel, \\"The Giants in the Poem of Naevius\\" The Journal of Roman Studies 44 (1954, pp. 14-17) p. 15 and note. Other giantesses in Greek myth include Periboea, the princess of the giants that participated in the Gigantomachy, and the queen and princess of the Laestrygonians who participated in the attacking and devouring of Odysseus' crew. =Norse mythology= Slave giantesses Fenja and Menja plot revenge against their selfish owner, King Fr√≥√∞i Grid Grid was a giantess who saved Thor's life. She was aware of Loki's plans to get Thor killed at the hands of the giant Geirrod and sets out to help him by supplying him with a number of magical gifts. These gifts were: a girdle of might, a pair of magical iron gloves, and a magical wand. Gerd The giantess Gerd was very beautiful and her brilliant, naked arms illuminated air and sea. Freyr fell in love at first sight and the account of her wooing is given in the poem Skirnism√°l. She never wanted to marry Freyr, and refused his proposals (delivered through Skirnir, his messenger) even after he brought her eleven golden apples and Draupnir. Skirnir finally threatened to use Freyr's sword to cover the earth in ice and she agreed to marry Freyr. She became the mother of the mythic Swedish king Fj√∂lnir. Ska√∞i Ska√∞i journeyed to √Åsgard to avenge her father √ûjazi, whom the gods had killed. She agreed that she would have that renounced if they allowed her to choose a husband among them and if they succeeded in making her laugh. The gods allowed her to choose a husband, but she had to choose him only from his feet; she choose Njord because his feet were so beautiful that she thought he was Baldr. Then Loki succeeded in making her laugh, so peace was made, and Odin made two stars from √ûjazi's eyes. After a while, she and her husband separated, because she loved the mountains (√ûrymheimr), while he wanted to live near the sea (Noatun). The Ynglinga saga says that later she became wife of Odin, and had many sons by him. Hyrrokin At Baldr's funeral, his burning ship was set to sea by Hyrrokin, a giantess, who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook. Thokk Upon Frigg's entreaties, delivered through the messenger Hermod, Hel promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. And all did, except a giantess, Thokk, who refused to mourn the slain god. And thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnarok, when he and his brother Hod would be reconciled and rule the new Earth together with Thor's sons. =Hinduism= Giantesses are fairly common in Indian mythology. The demoness Putana (who attempted to kill the baby Krishna with poisoned milk from her breasts) is usually drawn as a giantess. =Celtic mythology= Giantesses are common in the folklore of Ireland and the British Isles, particularly Scotland and Wales. They were often depicted as loving and beautiful people and, in later versions of myths, seemed to resemble Vikings, who had raided the coasts, in appearance. A notable giantess in Irish mythology is B√©binn. Modern art and literatureBooks= In Lewis Carroll's story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, there are several scenes where the heroine Alice grows to giant size by means of eating something (like a cake or a mushroom). Similarly Arthur C. Clarke's story Cosmic Casanova describes an astronaut's revulsion at discovering that an extraterrestrial female he adored on a video screen is in fact thirty feet tall. =Comics= Size-changing heroines have appeared in such comics as Doom Patrol, Mighty Avengers, Marvel Adventures Avengers, Team Youngblood, and Femforce. In the latter series, the giantess-superheroines Tara and Garganta combine immense size and strength with beauty and femininity, and have a cult following among both men and women. Conversely, size-changing villainesses, such as Wonder Woman foe Giganta, use their strength and beauty for less altruistic purposes as a weapon to crush their foes. Giantesses are also common in the manga and anime mediums of Japan. She-Hulk's nickname is \\"The Jade Giantess\\", due to the main character growing in size and more powerful when becoming She-Hulk. The giantess also appears in modern-day art, illustration and fashion. UK based illustrator Emma Melton has used the giantess as a symbol in her illustrated fashion line 'Blessed by a Giantess', which aims to promote healthy body image in young girls and spread the message that 'We are all beautiful. =Motion pictures= Poster of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman The giantess theme has also appeared in motion pictures, often as a metaphor for female empowerment or played for absurd humor. The 1958 B-movie Attack of the 50 Foot Woman formed part of a series of size-changing films of the era which also included The Incredible Shrinking Man, The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock, and Village of the Giants. The 1993 remake of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, starring Daryl Hannah in the title role, was advertised as a comedy; many scenes did parody earlier size-changing movies (most notably The Amazing Colossal Man), although the central theme was feminist. The heroine Nancy, formerly a cipher to her domineering father and husband, is empowered by her new-found size and starts to take control of her destiny, and encourages other women to do the same. Both versions of the movie enjoy a cult following. More recent movies with giantess themes are Honey, I Blew Up the Kid (1992), Mal√®na (2000), Dude, Where's My Car? (2000), Hable con ella a.k.a. Talk to Her (2002), Ella Enchanted (2004), The Ant Bully (2006), Monsters vs. Aliens (2009) and Roger Corman's Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader (2012). In Mal√®na, there is a scene where the young protagonist, Renato Amoroso, fantasizes about being a few inches tall and having Monica Bellucci (Malena), pick him up and take him to her bosom. In Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, after Adam grew 112 feet tall and had been wandering through Las Vegas, Diane Szalinski, who was the wife of Wayne Szalinski and mother of Adam, asked her husband to enlarge her so she can hug Adam and prevent Hendrickson from harming her son. As she was exposed to electrical waves, Diane became a 120 foot tall giantess, but later returns to her normal size with her son Adam at her side. In Dude, Where's My Car?, five nubile female characters morph into an extraterrestrial 20 foot tall giantess played by Jodi Ann Paterson (Playboy Playmate of the Year 2000) who picks up one of the characters and eats him. Talk to Her features a sequence in the style of early silent cinema called 'The Shrinking Lover,' where an accidentally shrunken scientist is rescued from his mother's clutches by his lover, who carries him home in her handbag. The shrunken scientist then roams his lover's body while she lies in bed. Monsters vs. Aliens features a satirization of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman in which the main protagonist, Susan Murphy, is clobbered by a radioactive meteor that causes her to grow up to 49 feet, 11¬Ω inches, becoming Ginormica. In Roger Corman's Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader, Cassie Stradford, a college student of Iron Coast University, steals the drug and injects herself with it to make her very pretty. However, the drug had a really big side effect when she starts to grow taller and taller until she is a 50 foot tall giantess. When Brittany discovers this, she tried to seduce Kyle into giving it to her. Even when Kyle was trying to prevent her from knowing, she was accidentally injected with more of the drug than Cassie and growing into a 75 foot tall giantess. After a brief catfight, Cassie injected the antidote into Brittany, making her shrink into a dwarf. Outside of Hollywood, giantesses have also appeared in special interest films. AC Comics giantess Garganta is featured in a live action DVD movie available from accomics.com entitled Gargantarama, which also includes giantess scenes from many movies as well as the feature length 1958 B-movie Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. Embracing the use of the giantess in popular culture, AC has made it a frequently recurring theme in their products. Giantesses have also appeared in advertisement campaigns, with similar erotic/humorous intent. In 2003, a commercial for the Italian company Puma featured the theme. The giantess, played by model/actress Valentina Biancospino, stomps around town causing havoc and swallowing a man whole before finally picking up a man (played by Italian footballer Gianluigi Buffon) and kissing him. The following year, Lee Dungarees commercials used the giantess theme alongside the slogan \\"Whatever Happens, Don't Flinch,\\" hiring model Natalia Adarvez to play a 90 foot tall giantess. Also that same year, Victoria Silvstedt (1997 Playboy Playmate of the Year) posed as a giantess for an advertisement for Max Power London, a car show held in London in November 2004. In the February 12th, 2005 edition of the UK newspaper, The Sun, Miss Silvstedt again posed as a giantess of Godzilla height next to various London landmarks. In a CSL ad, model Polly Brindle appeared as a 98 foot tall giantess walking around the city of London and meets a giant, who is the same height as her. Giantesses have also appeared in some television series such as Genie in the House, Snorks, Schoolhouse Rock, The Electric Company, The Muppet Show, Dexter's Laboratory, Animaniacs, Toonsylvania, Kids Next Door, The Powerpuff Girls in Attack of the Fifty Footed Woman, Totally Spies! episode in Attack Of The 50 Ft Mandy, Phineas and Ferb, and The 7D. The Snorks episode \\"The Littlest Mermaid\\" features a scene where a mermaid grows into a giantess caused by a machine. The Schoolhouse Rock episode \\"Unpack Your Adjectives\\" includes a scene where a tall girl grows into a 34-foot giantess, causing only her legs and sandals to be seen. She then stomps on a small boy who wouldn't stop laughing at how tall she grew. In the first episode of The Electric Company, Judy Graubart grows into a giantess while holding up a sign for the kid audience to read that says \\"giant\\". In the Dexter's Laboratory episode \\"The Big Sister\\", Dee Dee becomes a 65-foot giantess after eating an experimental cookie. The Animaniacs character Katie Ka-Boom sometimes grew giant sized before she turned into a monster. In the Phineas and Ferb episode \\"Attack of the 50 Foot Sister\\", Candace Flynn grows into a giantess after she uses some of Phineas and Ferb's growth potion. In the episode \\"Pony Tale\\" of Genie in the House, Max's niece Louise gets left with the girls, and when she learned of the genie's existence, she made a wish of wanting to get big, in which the genie was forced to accept her command and made her into 55 foot tall giantess for a brief time. In the Kids Next Door Episode Operation S.P.R.O.U.T The 3 kids shrink down in size for a mission and the now massive Number 3 stomps her heavy foot on the ground causing her shrunken team to shake due to the impact of her weight. At the end, she shakes them violently in her hand and finally sends them away in their mission. In the Powerpuff girls Episode What's the big idea Mojo uses his new technology make the girls gigantically huge. The giant girls laughed at him loudly then Blossom calls him an idiot threatens him that are huge and can crush Mojo under their massive weight. Mojo challenges them. Blossom accepts, she lifts her weighty foot slowly with debris falling under her shoe. Before she could stomp on Mojo, he moves out of the way everytime and the impact of Blossom's weight causes the city to shake and getting damaged. The girls will have trouble catching Mojo due to being so big and slow. But at the end of the day, the girls become normal in size due to Professor's cure and put Mojo in jail. The giantess theme occasionally manifests in music videos as well, notably Pamela Anderson's role as a giantess in the video Miserable for the rock group Lit. In the video, the band members perform on Anderson's body and are eventually devoured by her at the end, a metaphor for women as \\"maneaters\\".
