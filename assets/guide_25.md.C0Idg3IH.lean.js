Among piercing enthusiasts he is also known as an early pioneer of the contemporary resurgence in body piercing. Early life and professional career Richard Simonton was born in Evanston, Illinois, in 1915. His father died when he was three, and his mother subsequently moved to Seattle, where he grew up in the difficult conditions of the Great Depression. He showed an early aptitude for music and audio engineering, earning money in high school by tuning pipe organs. He later worked for the Masterphone Sound Company, which installed sound systems in silent theatres adapting to the new talking pictures. Always of an inventive and entrepreneurial mindset, before the age of twenty he had patented a circuit for electronic organs. In time he made his way to Southern California, where he was licensed as a professional engineer by the state and worked for Peerless Transformers and subsequently for RCA. In 1939, Simonton went to New York to meet with the founders of the Muzak Corporation, which had been founded some five years before. He proposed that Muzak begin franchising, which it had not previously done, and ended up buying the franchise for the seven Western states, which he held until the 1970s. On the strength of this success, he began acquiring holdings in TV and radio stations, which included KRKD radio in Los Angeles and KULA radio and TV in Hawaii, the ABC affiliate. He became a successful businessman and built an elaborate home in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, where he lived until his death in 1979 at the age of 64. The house included two organs and a 63-seat home theatre, where he showed movies to large audiences every week for many years. Outgoing and sociable, Simonton was popular in the Hollywood community. Friends and visitors included people such as Groucho Marx, Laurence Olivier, and the composer Aram Khachaturian. His best friend for many years was the silent film star Harold Lloyd; he was a trustee of Lloyd's estate. Simonton and his wife Helena and had four children: Richard Jr., Robert, Mary, and Margaret. He was an involved family man, taking his family to live in Hawaii for some months and on other travels. They regularly spent summers on board the Delta Queen. The children convinced him to save the Delta Queen in 1958 when they learned that the boat was in financial distress and was not accepting reservations. Due to his children's demands, Simonton bought a controlling interest in the company and made it profitable. He also founded Pacific Network, Inc. (PNI) and California Communications (CCI), firms that rented motion picture sound equipment to studios. In the early 1970s, Simonton had an emergency operation for complications of appendicitis; the operation went wrong and he suffered brain damage as a result. He spent several years struggling to regain full command of basic skills, including control of his speech. At this point, he largely retired from public life, although in time he was able to continue his love of travel and his wide community of friends. He died in 1979 from a heart problem, likely related to the damage sustained in the operation. The American Theatre Organ Society As a tremendous fan of theatre organ music, Simonton arranged a gathering at his home on February 8, 1955, where he and several other organ enthusiasts founded an association called the American Theatre Organ Enthusiasts, later shortened to the American Theatre Organ Society, which is still highly active today. During the remainder of his life, he was extremely active in the preservation and promotion of theatre organs and the music played upon them. His home contained two organs, a church-style Aeolian-Skinner pipe organ upstairs which was dedicated by Virgil Fox and a Wurlitzer theatre organ downstairs in the theatre, which was equipped with professional recording equipment. Film showings at his home were often accompanied by live organ, played by some of the great theatre organists of the day, including Gaylord Carter, Jesse Crawford, Gordon Kibbee and Korla Pandit, all of whom performed and recorded at the house. Simonton also owned a third organ, the Wurlitzer pipe organ from the New York Paramount Theatre, which has been considered the greatest Wurlitzer pipe organ ever built. It had been the favored instrument of Jesse Crawford. Simonton acquired it with the idea of buying the Belmont Theatre in Los Angeles and installing the organ, but the deal for the theatre fell through and the organ was never set up in Los Angeles. It is now in the civic center in Wichita, Kansas. For a time Simonton also owned the Rogers touring organ. This was one of the touring organs used by Virgil Fox. The Delta Queen In 1957, Simonton took his family for a river trip aboard the Delta Queen, a 285-foot steamboat then operating on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. Built in the 1920s, the Delta Queen had begun as a California riverboat operating between San Francisco and Sacramento. After Simonton's cruise, the owners of the Delta Queen found they could not keep the business going. Simonton had so enjoyed his trip aboard the boat that he saved the enterprise, buying a controlling interest in 1957-58. With partners including E. J. Quinby, he turned the enterprise around, and even added an 1897 steam calliope rescued from the sunken Island Queen. For forty-two years, the boat ran on a series of Congressional exemptions from Safety at Sea laws. In 1966, Simonton sent his employee Bill Muster to Washington, DC to obtain the first exemption. Although the boat never went to sea, it would have been subject to Safety at Sea laws because it was built of wood from the water up. Bill Muster and company vice president Betty Blake led the effort to list the Delta Queen on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. President Carter campaigned from the Delta Queen and was on it in 1979 on the day that Simonton died. The Welte-Mignon Piano Rolls The Welte-Mignon Reproducing Piano was a sophisticated cousin of the player piano, a mechanical instrument that could reproduce the subtleties of master pianists' styles by means of paper rolls. Invented by Edwin Welte and his brother-in-law Karl Bockisch in Freiburg, Germany, in 1904, the system was applied to organs with the \\"Welte Philharmonic-Organ\\" in 1912. The rolls, recorded between 1904 and 1932, are now historically significant as part of the Welte-Mignon legacy and as unique witnesses to the playing styles of the prominent musicians who played for the originals. These include Mahler, Debussy, Faure, Ravel, Scriabin, and others, playing their own compositions, a historically invaluable resource. (They are particularly interesting when they make mistakes playing their own works.) The Welte firm and its founders suffered heavily in World War II. After the war, Simonton wrote to Edwin Welte in an attempt to locate music rolls for his pipe organ. Welte answered that he had only managed to save about sixteen organ rolls, which he would exchange for food. He added that he and Bockisch had lost nearly everything in the war, but had managed to hide some of the piano rolls in a barn in the Black Forest. In 1948 Simonton travelled to Germany and went with Welte to the remains of the factory, which had been completely destroyed by bombing in 1944. Nothing remained standing; only the hidden master rolls in the Black Forest had survived. Simonton worked with Welte and Bockisch to rescue the legacy of the rolls. They played the rolls on Bockisch's Steinway-Welte piano and Simonton recorded the sound onto a tape recorder, an invention which was also extremely rare at the time. These tapes were released as LPs by Columbia Records in 1950. Welte and Bockisch selected and sold the best of the rolls to Simonton in 1948; some of the boxes arrived with straw from the barn still in them. He bought more from Bockisch's widow in 1952. Simonton remained in correspondence with Welte and Bockisch for many years, sending food parcels and other supplies, and Welte's daughter lived with the Simonton family for a time. After the initial purchase, Welte and Bockisch also found a Steinway-Welte piano for Simonton. Many of the rolls have since been re-recorded from that piano and issued on CD. Simonton ultimately donated the rolls to the music library at the University of Southern California. Body piercing innovator and promoter Richard Simonton is best known in certain communities for his interest in alternative lifestyles. In 1932, he met and became inspired by Ernest Holmes, the author of The Science of Mind and founder of Religious Science, a metaphysical movement. Throughout his life Simonton was interested in similar topics, travelling to India and the Philippines to explore non- Western ideas. His interest in body piercing would also have been considered shocking at the time, and as he explored these interests later in life he adopted the name Doug Malloy to preserve his privacy. His family was largely sheltered from his involvement in the piercing movement and in aspects of the gay or bisexual lifestyle newly emerging in the 1970s. As Doug Malloy, he was an instrumental supporter and patron of the early body modification scene. By 1975, he had published a short, largely fictional autobiography entitled Diary of a Piercing Freak under his assumed name, which was sold to a fetish publisher and released in softback under the title The Art of Pierced Penises and Decorative Tattoos. He had also established contacts amongst body piercing enthusiasts both in Los Angeles and on a global scale, including London tattooist Alan Oversby (also known as Mr. Sebastian), Roland Loomis (also known as Fakir Musafar), Sailor Sid Diller, and Jim Ward. He and Ward started what they called the T&P; Group—short for tattooing and piercing—an association of tattoo and piercing enthusiasts based primarily in Los Angeles. In 1977 Malloy visited the German tattooist and piercing pioneer Horst \\"Samy\\" Streckenbach in Frankfurt am Main. He documented this meeting by means of a tape recording, which has been preserved.runningthegauntlet-book.com: Voices from the Past—part 4 Doug Malloy in Conversation with Tattoo Samy and friends The upsurge in interest in body piercing had created enough interest that Simonton advised Jim Ward, who was working as a picture framer at the time, that he should start a body piercing business. In 1975, Simonton advanced Ward the money to start Gauntlet, originally a home based business, and Jim began to produce body piercing jewelry and learn how to pierce. This business began in November 1975, and it is considered the first of its type in the United States and was the beginning of the body piercing industry.\\"Running the Gauntlet\\" , cited in \\"In the Flesh: Body Piercing as a Form of Commodity-Based Identity and Ritual Rite of Passage,\\" honors thesis by Amelia Guimarin, under the direction of Prof. Teresa Caldiera, Anthropology, UC Irvine, 2005 Simonton's experience as an amateur piercer formed the basis of the primitive techniques used at the time and his network of contacts was instrumental in spreading the popularity of body piercing. Ward perfected these techniques which have become industry standard the world over. In 1978, Gauntlet obtained a retail location. Doug also provided extensive notes that were ghostwritten by Ward into full articles for Piercing Fans International Quarterly (PFIQ), the first magazine devoted to the subject of body piercing, a Gauntlet publication. One of Simonton's other notable contributions to the development of body piercing in contemporary society was his pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief, which is responsible for a large portion of the myths surrounding the origins of many piercings, most notably genital ones. Simonton's personal enthusiasm for body piercing as an erotic practice and his love of the fantastic came together in this document, which contains some fictional and/or speculative information. Many of the theories regarding the practice and origins of various piercings historically have been distorted by the widespread circulation of this document or later documents which quote it.

Biography Davie was born in Grangemouth in 1920. His father, James William Davie, was a painter who exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Français in 1925. Alan Davie studied at Edinburgh College of Art in the late 1930s. An early exhibition of his work came through the Society of Scottish Artists. After the Second World War, Davie played tenor saxophone in the Tommy Sampson Orchestra, which was based in Edinburgh but broadcast and toured in Europe. He also earned a living making jewellery during the postwar period. Davie travelled widely and in Venice became influenced by other painters of the period, such as Paul Klee, Jackson Pollock and Joan Miró, as well as by a wide range of cultural symbols. In particular, his painting style owes much to his affinity with Zen. Having read Eugen Herrigel's book Zen in the Art of Archery (1953), he assimilated the spontaneity which Zen emphasises. Declaring that the spiritual path is incompatible with planning ahead, he attempted to paint as automatically as possible, which was intended to bring forth elements of his unconscious. In this, he shared a vision with surrealist painters such as Miró, and he was also fascinated by the work of psychoanalyst Carl Jung. Like Pollock, many of Davie's works were executed by standing above the painting, which was laid on the ground. He added layers of paint until sometimes the original painting had been covered over many times. Despite the speed at which he worked (he usually had several paintings on the go at once), however, he was adamant that his images are not pure abstraction, but all have significance as symbols. Championing the primitive, he saw the role of the artist as akin to that of the shaman, and remarked upon how disparate cultures have adopted common symbols in their visual languages. In addition to painting, whether on canvas or paper (he has stated that he prefers to work on paper), Davie produced several screenprints. He found a public for his work on the continent and in America some time before the British art public could reconcile itself to his mixture of ancient and newly invented symbols. In his lectures Davie stressed the importance of improvisation as his chosen method. His stance was that of an inspired soothsayer resisting the inroads of rational civilization. Musically, Davie also played piano, cello and bass clarinet. In the early 1970s his interest in free improvisation led to a close association with the percussionist Tony Oxley. His paintings have also inspired music by others, notably the bassist and composer Barry Guy. Davie designed the jacket for R.W. Feachem's book Prehistoric Scotland, published by Batsford in 1963. The design was based upon motifs found on Pictish symbol stones. He died aged 93 in Hertfordshire, England on 5 April 2014. Art collections Art collections and museums owning work by Alan Davie include the Art Institute of Chicago, Dallas Museum of Art, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, National Galleries of Scotland, Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Tate Gallery, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Brauer Museum of Art at Valparaiso University, Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art at the University of Oklahoma, Harvard University Art Museums, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, Oklahoma City Museum of Art, The Priseman Seabrook Collection, San Diego Museum of Art, Southampton City Art Gallery, The Hepworth Wakefield and Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum.

This strange, often baffling book concerns an unnamed narrator who attempts to discover the truth about the love lives of his fellow guests at a weekend party in the English countryside. He spurns the \\"detective and keyhole\\" methods as ignoble, and instead tries to decipher these relationships purely from the behavior and appearance of each guest. He expends huge resources of energy and ingenuity on his theories, much to the bemusement of some people at the party.  Plot summary  As he waits for the train to take him to a weekend party in the country, the narrator notices that Gilbert Long seems much more assured and lively than before. He also sees that Mrs. Brissenden (nicknamed \\"Mrs. Briss\\") is much younger-looking than her husband, though she's actually ten years older. The narrator begins to theorize that Long and Mrs. Briss are getting their vitality, vampire-like, from the \\"sacred fount\\" of their sexual partners' energy. At first, the narrator theorizes that the source of Long's newfound assurance and intelligence is a certain Lady John. Later he changes his mind, as he constantly discusses his ideas with others at the party, particularly an artist, Ford Obert. The narrator notices that another woman at the party, May Server, seems listless, and he starts to wonder if she may be the lover providing vitality to Long. Eventually, the narrator begins to construct enormously elaborate theories of who is taking vitality from whom, and whether some people are acting as screens for the real lovers. In a long midnight confrontation with Mrs. Briss which concludes the novel, she says the narrator's theories are ridiculous, and he has completely misread the actual relationships of their fellow guests. She finishes by telling him he's crazy, and that last word leaves the narrator dismayed and overwhelmed.  Key themes  While the narrator is often exasperating about his rather prurient interest in his fellow guests' sex lives, he does seem similar to other central characters in James' fiction who try to discover the truth from often misleading bits of information. But after a while, the narrator's theories begin to drive everybody, including the reader, a little nuts, as those theories constantly shift and grow incredibly complex. Therefore, when Mrs. Briss dismisses the narrator as crazy, she might gain some sympathy from many readers. Of course, it's possible that Mrs. Briss is only trying to fool the narrator to conceal her own love affairs. Nothing is certain in this novel of shifting appearances and endless theories, with no final revelation of the truth. The Sacred Fount has been seen as everything from a serious discussion of the \\"vampire\\" theory of human sexuality to a parody/treatment of the artist's construction of an alternative and more profound reality. But many have expressed simple bewilderment over what, if anything, James was trying to accomplish in the novel. James himself said that the book was \\"calculated to minister to curiosity,\\" but many have maintained that the novel does little or nothing to reward that curiosity. Criticism Early critics treated the novel with blank incomprehension or near-contempt. Rebecca West issued one her wittiest sneers when she wrote: the narrator \\"spends more intellectual force than Kant can have used on The Critique of Pure Reason in an unsuccessful attempt to discover whether there exists between certain of his fellow-guests a relationship not more interesting among these vacuous people than it is among sparrows.\\" With that devastating dismissal ringing down through the decades, The Sacred Fount has not enjoyed a good press. Many critics have thrown up their hands over what one early reviewer called a \\"brilliantly stupid piece of work.\\" James himself omitted the book from the New York Edition (1907-1909) of his fiction, one of the very few later novels not to make the grade. Indeed, in a letter, dated March 15, 1901, to Mrs Humphry Ward, James declared: \\"I say it in all sincerity – the book isn't worth discussing [...] I hatingly finished it; trying to make it – the one thing it 'could' be – a 'consistent' joke.\\"Henry James Letters, Ed. Leon Edel, Vol. IV (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984) p.185-6 (The other exclusion among the later novels was The Other House (1896). The Outcry (1910) was published too late to make the edition.) Ezra Pound, in his 1934 book ABC of Reading highly praised the novel, saying: \\"When you have read James' prefaces and twenty of his novels, you would do well to read The Sacred Fount. There for perhaps the first time since 1300 a writer has been able to deal with a sort of content wherewith Cavalcanti had been 'concerned'.Ezra Pound: ABC of Reading, London 1951, p.90 But as time has passed, and more peculiar works of art have gained acceptance, some critics have started to praise The Sacred Fount as a parable of how people shape appearances into an explanation of an impossibly complex world. The book's preoccupation with the \\"vampire\\" theory, though, has continued to evoke occasional ridicule and little serious interest. The critical literature on the book keeps piling up due to the novel's mystery and lack of a final resolution, and connections have been made to other works by James, particularly The Turn of the Screw and In the Cage, which also feature unnamed and imaginative protagonists. In popular culture In Chapter 21 of Donna Leon's third Guido Brunetti detective novel, Dressed for Death (1994; aka The Anonymous Venetian), Paola tells Guido, \\"I'm reading the master. The Sacred Fount is wonderful. Nothing happens, absolutely nothing.\\" Later in the conversation, she states: \\"I'm already eager to finish it so that I can begin it all over again immediately.\\"  References  Bibliography * Introduction to The Sacred Fount by Leon Edel (New York: Grove Press, Inc. 1979) * The Novels of Henry James by Edward Wagenknecht (New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., 1983) * A Henry James Encyclopedia by Robert Gale (New York: Greenwood Press, 1989) External links * Original book text of The Sacred Fount (1901) * Category:1901 American novels Category:Novels by Henry James Category:Methuen Publishing books ","title":"The Sacred Fount"},{"id":"3434400","text":"Gabriel-Elzéar Taschereau Gabriel-Elzéar Taschereau (March 27, 1745 – September 18, 1809) was the second in a line of distinguished French Canadians whose influence has spanned three centuries.

On leaving the army he taught art at Bristol, at Bristol University Adult Education Department and afterwards at the Royal West of England Academy, and combined these posts with teaching at London University Department of Extra-Mural Studies. During the 1950s he presented the popular BBC television series, 'Painting for Housewives', and frequently broadcast on BBC radio and interviewed artists for BBC archives. During the late 1950s he also wrote exhibition reviews for ArtReview, then titled Art News and Review.Art News and Review Vol 7 No 7 p17, 14 September 1956 As a result of his teaching experience Levy began publishing on the techniques of art - Painter's progress (1954), Painting for All (1958), Drawing and painting for young people (1961), The Human form in art (1961), The Moons of Paradise: some reflections on the appearance of the female breast in art (1962), A Dictionary of Art Terms (1963), The artist and the nude: an anthology of drawings (1965), and Drawing and sculpture (1970). His interest in Art Nouveau led to the publication of his Liberty Style: the classic years 1898-1910 (1986). However, he became increasingly interested in particular artists, and in the course of a distinguished career as a critic he produced monographs on Drawings of L. S. Lowry (1963), The Paintings of D. H. Lawrence (1964), The Paintings of L.S. Lowry: oils and watercolours (1975), Whistler lithographs: an illustrated catalogue raisonne (1975), The Drawings of L. S. Lowry public and private (1976), and Carel Weight (1986). In 1968 he, with Pamela Hansford Johnson and Robert Lowell, contributed to Perry Miller Adato's documentary film, Dylan Thomas The World I Breathe. In addition he wrote contributions or introductions to exhibition catalogues and studies on several artists - Frans Baljon (1948), Eva Frankfurther (1962), Gaudier-Brzeska drawings and sculpture (1965), Horace Brodzky retrospective (1965), Scottie Wilson (1966), Clifford Hall (1967), Carel Weight (1972), John Bignell Chelsea photographer (1983), the (Ruth) Lambert Collection (1988), Ronald Ossory Dunlop (1989?), Rabuzin (1990) and Colin Moss (1996). In 1982 he published his autobiography, Reflections in a broken mirror. His pencil portrait of LS Lowry (1961), is held at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Coventry.Mervyn Levy, ‘Lowry, Laurence Stephen (1887–1976)’, rev. Julian Spalding, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 His strong absorption in the personalities of creative artists made Levy an excellent interviewer and raconteur. Levy married three times. He had two sons and one daughter, Maureen.C. Levy, 'Obituary: Mervyn Levy', in The Independent (1996 May 17) He died on 14 April 1996. A portrait of Mervyn Levy by Alfred Janes (1935) is held by the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea. Mervyn Levy's niece is the artist, Isa Levy.

The line links the Boulogne – Pont de Saint Cloud metro station in Boulogne in the west with the Gare d'Austerlitz, travelling under the neighborhoods situated on the Rive Gauche in the southern half of Paris and the commune of Boulogne-Billancourt. Its two termini are Gare d'Austerlitz and Boulogne – Pont de Saint-Cloud. The line is entirely underground and stretches across 23 stations. It has the least traffic of any of the 14 main metro lines (excluding lines 3bis and 7bis). Initially, the MA 51 model trains, which had previously been used on line 13 until it joined line 14, circulated the tracks of line 10. These trains were first constructed with three cars on four chassis per train, and two trains permanently connected to make six cars per train, having an equivalent capacity to five cars on the classic metro trains. Because of the ineffectiveness of the MA 51 model, it was eventually completely replaced by the MF 67 model. The line's history is closely tied to that of lines 7, 8, and 13. A section of line 10's route was replaced by line 13, and line 10 replaced part of line 7 for more than a year, until eventually replacing the western section of line 8 where its terminus was replaced by Balard. There is a ghost station named Croix-Rouge between Sèvres Babylone and Mabillon. It was closed in 1939. Consequently, line 10 has changed the most of any other métro line during its lifetime. Unlike those of other lines, the walls of line 10's tunnels are painted white, creating a brightness that is not found on any other métro line. Route and stations Line 10 measures across 23 stations and one ghost station, Croix-Rouge, closed in 1939. The route is entirely underground. File:Paris Metro Ligne 10.svgGeographically accurate path of Paris Métro Line 10 =List of stations= Beginning at the western terminus of line 10, the first train that leaves the station Porte d'Auteuil heads towards the terminus of gare d'Austerlitz. At this time, passengers may ride on the turn-around track, which is closed to passengers for the rest of the day. SIEL, système d'information en ligne, gives passengers on the platforms the time-to-arrival of the next two trains, and has been operational since 1 July 2008. At the terminus Boulogne – Pont de Saint-Cloud (Rhin et Danube), because of the proximity to the Seine, there are no tracks behind the station to allow the train to reverse directions. Instead, trains are received alternately on each side of the platform and leave directly in the opposite direction. Due to the narrowness of the rue du Château, under which line 10 passes, the stations Boulogne – Pont de Saint-Cloud (Rhin et Danube) and Boulogne – Jean Jaurès have only one central platform used for both directions. After this last station, tracks run for to reconnect trains to Auteuil. Tracks 1 (towards Austerlitz) must successively pass under the Boulevard Périphérique, followed by the platforms for the connections to Auteuil and Murat before ascending to service the station Michel – Ange – Molitor. In order to achieve this, ramps reaching a descent of up to a 40‰ grade are used. Tracks 2 (towards Boulogne) are separated by the loop on the level of the avenue du Général-Sarrail with a bend and a slope of 40‰. The loop to Auteuil is situated in the neighborhood of Auteuil: tracks 1 and 3 of the loop border the central platform of Miche-Ange – Molitor. Afterwards, they pass under the rails of line 9, until combining at the arrival to Chardon- Lagache with a unique platform. Finally, tracks 1 reach the station Mirabeau and then go towards Austerlitz. Tracks 2, coming from Austerlitz, follow a very peculiar profile and do not service the station Mirabeau, instead crossing behind it with a sharp ramp due to the great depth of the line after traversing the Seine. Furthermore, in order to reach the station Église d'Auteuil, the tracks must climb even higher very close to the station's foundation. Following this, tracks 2 of the line pass behind tracks of line 9 and arrive at the station Michel-Ange – Auteuil, which has a central platform surrounded by tracks 2 and tracks H coming from a connection with line 9. Arriving at Porte d'Auteuil, the tracks separate to form the complexity of tracks that head towards Boulougne, a maintenance station, Murat, or towards Michel-Ange – Molitor. Platform of the station Jussieu. After the station Mirabeau, the line crosses the Seine via an underwater tunnel and reaches the station Javel – André Citroën by way of a 40‰ ramp after passing under tracks of line C of the RER. Following this, the line follows avenue Émile-Zola to arrive at the stations Charles Michels and Avenue Émile Zola before joining the rue du Commerce. When the line reaches the station La Motte-Picquet – Grenelle, the two tracks separate: tracks 1 are situated in a half-station with platform 1 of line 8 and tracks 2 service a half station but without tracks 2 of line 8 which are situated below. Before arriving at the station Ségur, the line passes under the Rapp intake. It then services the stations Duroc, Vaneau and Sèvres – Babylone. The line continues eastward and passes through the vacant station Croix-Rouge, which was closed on 2 September 1939. Finally, the line arrives at Mabillon. Beginning at Odéon the route of line 10 becomes complixed as it must pass an intersection with line 4. The two tracks part in order to yield passage to the connection tracks that arrive in the middle of the circulation tracks and level off at the station Cluny – La Sorbonne. The connection tracks rejoin the other tracks of line 10 before the station Maubert – Mutualité. The same principle is in effect with the connection to line 7 but these double tracks pass under the tracks of line 10 before the station Cardinal Lemoine. When the route reaches the station Jussieu, lines 7 and 10 follow parallel routes which allows for the platforms of the two lines to be side by side. Finally, the line follows bends in both direction under the Jardin des plantes to arrive at the terminus, Gare d'Austerlitz. The arrival is situated under the arrivals hall of the train station, and the turn-around loop is under the railroad tracks. This cul-de- sac is peculiar in the sense that it is configured to receive an underwater passing coming from the gare de Paris-Lyon. =Split section of line 10= Line 10 has separate eastbound and westbound sections between the stations of Boulogne – Jean Jaurès (west) and Javel – André Citroën. Both sections run side by side between Javel – André Citroën and Mirabeau, but the Mirabeau station is only served by eastbound trains. Westbound trains pass through Mirabeau on an inclined ramp behind the eastbound tracks. Westbound section Eastbound section File:Metro Paris M10-plan.svgalt=Schematic of the line's route showing the split section The separate sections were once part of a loop that returned westgoing trains to Javel – André Citroën. After Porte d'Auteuil (last station on the westbound section) the trains turned round to Michel-Ange – Molitor (first station on the eastbound section). When the line was extended with Jean Jaurès and Boulogne the section was no longer operated as a loop. Porte d'Auteuil is also connected with Porte de Saint-Cloud of line 9. This connection is called \\"voie Murat\\" and it passes the ghost station Porte Molitor. The station was meant for spectators leaving the Parc des Princes football stadium, but plans were changed and access to the station from the streets was never constructed. Westbound trains on line 10 (terminating at Porte d'Auteuil) can be re-routed to line 9, starting eastbound at Porte de Saint-Cloud via the \\"voie Murat\\" connection. This option is used after events at Parc des Princes when Line 9 is used by unusually many people. =Renamed stations= Five stations on line 10 have changed names of the course of the years: *La Motte-Picquet became La Motte-Picquet – Grenelle in November 1913; *Wilhem became Église d'Auteuil on 15 May 1921; *Beaugrenelle became Charles Michels on 14 July 1945; *Gare d'Orléans – Austerlitz became Gare d'Austerlitz in 1979; *Cluny became Cluny – La Sorbonne on 17 February 1988. =Themed and otherwise unique stations= One of the environmentally-related showcases in the station Sèvres – Babylone. Some stations on the line are decorated with a particular cultural theme in mind: The station Javel – André Citroën presents the life and enterprise of André Citroën with the use of placards and photographs. The seats of the station use the colors of the celebrated logo composed of chevrons, inspired by gears constructed in 1905. These decorations however were removed during the 2000s in light the renovation project \\"Renouveau du Métro\\". The halls used for connections in the station La Motte-Picquet – Grenelle are decorated with various coats of arms of the Toussaint-Guillaume Picquet de la Motte family (blue with three golden chevrons, accompanied by three silver arrowheads). A fresco represents the barrière de la Cunette, one of the doors of the Wall of the Farmers-General that was one situated where the station is now. The station Sèvres – Babylone contains an exposition of ecology, with showcases on recycling, renewable energy or water consumption and electricity consumption in the world. In 2008, these windows were renovated with signs giving specific information on the initiatives of Grenelle Environnement. The ceiling of the station Cluny – La Sorbonne is decorated with mosaics and signatures of famous writers such as Racine, Molière, Michelet, Victor Hugo, and Rimbaud. =Junctions= In the middle, intersection tracks towards line 4 to the west of the station Cluny – La Sorbonne. The line contains six junctions with other lines of the network: *with line 9 via Voie Murat and the depots located to the southwest of the station Porte d'Auteuil on the tracks of the old entrance that are no longer used in commercial service; *with line 9 at the entrance to the station Michel-Ange – Auteuil, on the tracks in the direction of Boulogne; this intersection runs alongside the platform of the station Michel-Ange – Auteuil, the edge of the platform being protected by fencing, and then intersects at the terminus. *with line 8 at the entrance to the station La Motte-Picquet – Grenelle, on the tracks heading towards Boulogne; *a tunnel without an intersection exists towards line 13, between the stations of Duroc and Vaneau; it dates back to the old route of line 10 towards Invalides; *with line 4 via a dead end in the east of the station Odéon, but intersecting in actuality at the east of the station Cluny – La Sorbonne after having traveled to the center of the station without bordering a platform; the intersection occurs between the two tracks of line 10 at the station Cluny – La Sorbonne where three tracks form but are then combined into the two of line 10; *with line 7 at the exit of the station Maubert – Mutualité in the direction of Gare d'Austerlitz; this two-track connection, used commercially between 1930 and 1931, is separated from line 10 by a strong slope between the two rails. =Depots= View of the service depot at Choisy. Trains on line 10 are serviced by the depots at Auteuil, which are connected to the tracks of the terminus Porte d'Auteuil. These depots are entirely underground; other than tunnels, an escalator located on the sidewalk of the avenue du Géneral-Sarrail provides access. The depots are connected to line 9 as well, however line 9 has not used these depots since the opening of those at Boulogne connected to Pont de Sèvres. Both heavy and regular (batteries, tune-ups, and repainting) maintenance of the trains of line 10, as with all other trains on the rail network, takes place at the depot at Choisy. Opened in 1931, it is situated in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, close to the Boulevard Périphérique and accessible via a junction on line 7. It is composed of two distinct sections: a maintenance workshop for the trains of line 7 (AMT), and a workshop for changing the composition of the trains on the network. The depot occupies a total of . 330 agents were employed at this depot in 2007. Usage =Service= In 2008, one complete trip across the line took twenty-eight minutes in the west–east direction and twenty-nine minutes in the opposite direction. As with all lines of the Paris métro (with the exception of the bis lines), the first departure of the day leaves the station at 5:30 am. A train leaves from Boulogne – Pont de Saint-Cloud at 5:35 am, preceded by the first departure on the line from Porte d'Auteuil at 5:30 am, which is also the only train that will take passengers on the turn-around loop at Auteuil. The last train leaves Boulogne – Pont de Saint Cloud at 12:47 am destined for Gare d'Austerlitz. From Gare d'Austerlitz, the last train leaves at 12:35 am for Boulogne – Pont de Saint-Cloud and another for Porte d'Auteuil at 12:51 am. From Friday night to Sunday and during holidays, the last departure from Boulogne – Pont de Saint-Cloud leaves at 1:47 am for Gare d'Austerlitz. From this terminus, the last departure takes place at 1:35 am for Boulogne – Pont de Saint-Cloud and at 1:46 am for Port d'Auteuil. Trains on line 10 are less frequent than those on other lines: the average time between trains is between three and five minutes during the day and between eight and nine minutes late night. On Sunday mornings, the time between trains is between six and seven minutes, and about ten minutes Friday night, and all of Saturday, Sunday, and holidays after 12:30 am (after 1:15 am on Friday and Saturday nights). =Train sets= Model of an MA 51 trainset in the musée des transports urbains, interurbains, et ruraux (Museum of Urban, Suburban, and Rural Transportation). Line 10 has always been unique with respect to its train sets. Before World War II, it was unusual in that it was circulated by Sprague model trains with two cars circulating alone as passenger traffic was very light. Until 1976, old Spragues circulated the line with four cars each (two motor cars with four motors). Line 13 transformed in the middle of the 1970s as a result of its junction with the old line 14, and a more modern and better performing train set, MF 67, was put in service. Beginning 28 April 1975, the old MA 51 train sets of line 13, numbering 52 in total, were progressively transferred to line 10 and drastically modernized. The cars were repainted, their outer bodies and seats replaced, and modern fluorescent lighting installed. They circulated in permanent sets of six. By June 1976, all of the trains had been transferred to line 10 and put into service, where they eventually ended their career. In order to reform the old Sprague models and because of an insufficient number of trainsets, some MF 67 train sets of the A/D model were placed on line 10 as well. The MA 1951 model was introduced between 1988 and 1994, and afterwards were replaced by MF 67 series E models coming from line 7bis. =Operational personnel= An MF 67 train set at the Sèvres – Babylone station (video). Employees of the métro can be divided into two categories: station agents and conductors. Station agents are responsible for ticket sales, verifying passenger tickets, general management of the station, as well as other tasks as the needs of the service dictate. The conductors assure the functioning of the trains. Service is divided into three shifts: day, mixed, and night. =Fares and financing= Fares on line 10 are identical to those on the rest of the transport network and are accessible via the same tickets. A ticket t+ allows for a single one-way trip with one or more connections with other lines of the metro as well as inner-city RER lines. The financing of the functioning of the line, maintenance, cars, and employees is handled by the RATP, however fares are dictated legislatively and income from ticket sales do not completely cover the network's entire costs. This difference is made up by funding from the Syndicat des transports d'Île- de-France (STIF) (Île-de-France Transportation Union), which has been presided over since 2005 by the president of the Conseil régional d'Île-de-France, composed of locally elected persons. This group defines the general conditions of use as well as the duration and frequency of services. Financing is assured by a 3.5 billion euro subsidy made possible through transportation deposits paid by corporations and contributions from public community groups. =Traffic= Line 10 is a secondary line on the Parisian network, and the number of total passengers amounts to only a little more than a quarter of the total passengers of line 1. Line 10 is the least-traveled line on the network, with the exception of the short 3bis and 7bis lines. Between 1992 and 2004, traffic has grown a total of 4.7%, which puts the line in 8th place in terms of growth (behind line 14). { class=\\"wikitable left\\" !

In 1998, daily traffic on line 10 averaged 148,613 passengers for each day the line was open, with 104,041 on Saturdays and 53,051 on Sundays. Tourism The Japanese Garden of the musée départemental Albert-Kahn in Boulogne-Billancourt. By way of its route, line 10 is limited to the south of the capital and, passing by few centers of activities, is rarely travelled by Parisians. With the exception of the oriental section Gare d'Austerlitz – Duroc, traffic is very light. On the other hand, the line is especially trafficked by students, as it links multiple important university centers such as the campus de Jussieu, la Sorbonne, and Sciences Po, for example. The line services several places of interest to tourists in Paris and its western suburb: *The Parc de Saint-Cloud and the jardin et musée départemental Albert-Kahn at Boulogne-Billancourt (Boulogne – Pont de Saint-Cloud); *The jardin des serres d'Auteuil and the stadium Roland-Garros (Port d'Auteuil); *The Thermes de Cluny, the Musée national du Moyen Âge, and the Latin Quarter (Cluny – La Sorbonne, Maubert – Mutualité and Cardinal Lemoine); *Parc des Princes football stadium (home of Paris Saint-Germain football club). *Invalides hosting the tomb of Napoléon Bonaparte. *Saint-Germain-des-Prés – famous for its history linked to the birth of existentialism, its love for jazz in old caves, its old churches and monasteries and some globally famous cafés. *Saint-Michel and the Latin Quarter. *The Institut du monde Arabe (the Arab World Institute). *Gare d'Austerlitz. History =Chronology= *30 December 1923: The first section of Line 10 was opened between Invalides and Croix Rouge (today, most of this section is served by line 13 ). *10 March 1925: The line was extended eastbound from Croix Rouge to Mabillon. *14 February 1926: The line was extended from Mabillon to Odéon. *15 February 1930: The line was temporarily extended from Odéon to Place d'Italie. *7 March 1930: The line was extended from Place d'Italie to Porte de Choisy. *26 April 1931: The section from Place Monge to Porte de Choisy was transferred to line 7 (as a result of the opening of Line 7's tunnel under the Seine). line 10 was also extended from Maubert- Mutualité to Jussieu. *27 July 1937: The section from Duroc to Invalides was transferred to the former line 14 (now part of line 13, not today's line 14). *29 July 1937: Line 10 was extended westbound from Duroc to La Motte-Picquet. The section between La Motte-Picquet and Porte d'Auteuil was transferred from line 8 to line 10. *12 July 1939: The line was extended eastbound from Jussieu to Gare d'Orléans-Austerlitz. *2 September 1939: As with many other stations, service to Croix-Rouge and Cluny-la Sorbonne stations ceased at the start of World War II. Both stations are eventually closed permanently. *3 October 1980: Line 10 was extended westbound from Porte d'Auteuil to Boulogne-Jean Jaurès. *2 October 1981: The line was extended from Boulogne-Jean Jaurès to Pont de Saint-Cloud. *17 February 1988: With to the opening of St-Michel station on the line B of the RER, Cluny-la Sorbonne Station was re-opened to allow a connection between the lines. =Service to Auteuil= Métro line 10 resulted from the connection of two sections, east and west, which created a set of distinct lines. The west section, from La Motte-Picquet to Grenelle à Porte d'Auteuil was initially a part of line 8. Blueprint of the underwater tunnel to pont Mirabeau. Steel beams in the Seine at pont Mirabeau, 1908. Line 8 was the last line created by the agreement of 30 March 1898, and consists of a route between Opéra and Porte d'Auteuil via Grenelle. In March 1910, the line was branched off and opened with line 7, and a branch leaving the station of Grenelle to the port of Sèvres (today Balard) was added to the route. The trains alternately traveled along the two branches.Tricoire 1999b, p. 248. Work on the line began in April 1908 with an underwater construction site in the Seine between the stations of Concorde and Invalides on one end and another construction site at Pont Mirabeau on the other.Tricoire 1999b, p. 249. The first site was completed in January 1911, after being delayed during the 1910 Great Flood of Paris. The tunnel under the Seine is made up of five box beams, between 35 and 44 meters long, pre-assembled on the quai de Javel (now the quai André-Citroën). This tunnel was dug using the method of wooden planks on top of a foundation made of chalk and shale. It contains a lining of iron positioned under a brick roof. The construction of the tunnel on the rive droite was more delicate because of its less solid alluvium, thus three additional beams were required which were assembled at Mirabeau. The presence of a railroad line running from Invalides to Versailles (line C of the RER) made work particularly difficult, and a final beam was buried under the tunnel. Work began in August 1907 but was not finished until 1913, also delayed by the 1910 Great Flood of Paris.Robert 1983, p. 201. The section between Invalides and Javel did not present any particular difficulties and was completed in 1910. The Grenelle station is constructed according to a double-station configuration, which allows for the simultaneous departure of trains towards Auteuil and the planned branch towards the porte of Sèvres on its own level, as well as the arrival of both trains in the opposite direction in a central platform on another level. While work at pont Mirabeau was ongoing, the line was opened to the public on 13 July 1913 between the stations Beaugrenelle and Opéra and was extended on 30 September 1913 to Porte d'Auteuil.Tricoire 1999b, p. 250. In 1914, line 8 contained fifteen stations between Porte d'Auteuil and Opéra.Robert 1983, p. 95. =The birth of line 10= The principal of a circular line, conceived at the start of the 1900s, led to the creation of a line called Ceinture intérieure des Invalids aux Invalides (inner belt from Invalides to Invalides). This 11.7 kilometer section was realized in 1907 under the name of line 10.Tricoire 1999b, p. ???. On the rive droite, the line had to borrow the platforms of line 8, and as such a set of complex connections were created under the esplanade of Invalides with the creation of a large loop. However, in October 1912, the principal of an interior belt was abandoned and line 10 was left to connect Invalides to Bastille via the rive gauche. Work on the section between Invalides and Croix-Rouge began in 1913 and ended on 18 March 1920. However the prospect of low revenues that would certainly result from such a small section serving only neighborhoods of little activity caused the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP) to delay the construction and postpone the opening and what would surely be a resulting deficit as far back as possible. Finally, after being required by the city to do so, the company opened the line for use on 30 December 1923. The new line 10 consisted of six stations, each of which with a vaulted ceiling. The line borrowed the rue de Four, the rue de Sèvres, and the boulevard des Invalides with a very pronounced bend at the station of Duroc. The line quickly became a financial disaster for the CMP, with an average of at most 1,000 passengers per day and per station. The terminus of Croix-Rouge received only four hundred daily passengers, and the station Varenne, the least frequented station of the entire métro network, saw only three hundred passengers per day. As a result, only ten trains of six cars serviced the line, two motor cars serving as first class cars, which saw so little traffic that they were replaced with simple motors equipped only with two conductor cars.Robert 1983, p. 109. =A wave of expansions in the east= Location of the station Croix-Rouge. Expansion work on the line followed in 1923 between Croix-Rouge and Odéon, creating a section 900 meters long connecting two additional stations. This tiny expansion nevertheless brought an increase of traffic due to its connection with line 4. It began servicing Mabillon on 10 March 1925 and Odéon on 14 February 1926. The city of Paris decided in 1925 to connect three lines to line 10. To this end, many possibilities were examined. It was first envisioned to extend the line to Bastille via place Jussieu, to complement the creation of a circular line. However the abandonment of the creation of a circular line made this expansion of little use and would require an underwater section very close to one already planned for line 7 toward pont de Sully. Eventually, the city chose to limit the line to Jussieu on the rive gauche to create a connection with line 7. Because of the difficulties the construction of an underwater section would present, and the time it would require, it was planned in 1927 to link to line 10 an expansion of line 7 between Jussieu and Porte de Choisy that was already underway. With this in mind, it was decided to create a connection with two platforms between the stations Maubert of line 10 and Place Monge of the future line 7 such that line 10 borrowed this section of line 7 while the underwater tunnel that connected the northern and southern sections of the line was constructed. The tunnel between Saint-Michel boulevard and Porte de Choisy was delivered by the city to CMP in November 1929. In less than three months, the platform was completed, the lighting installed, and access made possible. Line 10 arrived at Place d'Italie on 15 February 1930 and at Porte de Choisy on 7 March of the same year, borrowing the platforms of the future line 7. Before its renovation, the line serviced nineteen stations. The route of this new section runs parallel to those of above-ground transportation that were especially crowded. As a result, line 10 saw a rapid increase in use, however its route to the rive gauche did not respond well to the needs of passengers and therefore many used line 10 as a way to make connections to other lines, particularly line 5 at Place d'Italie and line 12 at Sèvres-Babylone to continue on to destinations on the rive droite. The western section Sèvres-Invalides remained sparsely traveled. =Modification of lines during the 1930s= Outline of the modifications of lines 8, 10, and 14 in 1937. At the same time that the underwater crossing of line 7 was completed, line 10's tunnel from Maubert to Jussieu was also completed. The route crossed intersection in the direction of Monge by a flying junction. On 21 April 1931, the underwater tunnel of line 7 was completed up to the station of Jussieu.Tricoire 1999b, p. 281. The completion of this station necessitated a considerable amount of work with regards to its location under the Halle-aux-Vins, upon which the Faculté des sciences de Jussieu is located. Here, the tracks are supported by concrete on both sides, and those of lines 7 and 10 lie side by side. On 21 April 1931, renovation of lines 7 and 10 began. Line 7 was extended from Sully-Morland on the rive droite to Porte d'Ivry, and the trains of line 10 ceased use of the middle section of line 7 and instead began the use of the new tracks up to Jussieu. At the same time, the station Cardinal Lemoine was opened. Traffic on line 10 diminished significantly but also became more evenly distributed across its sections.Robert 1983, p. 120. The line saw its largest renovation on its western section in 1937 and impacted several lines. At the time, the route of line 10 did not respond to the needs of a large number of passengers, however the development of a section between La Motte-Picquet and Balard had already been agreed upon, so the creation of line 14, Porte de Vanves – Bienvenüe (today a part of line 13), stayed in the plans. These considerations led the Conseil municipal de Paris (Municipal Council of Paris) to decide to have multiple extensions added and to effect a partial restructuring of the lines.Robert 1983, p. 130. Line 8 was given a new terminus at Balard and the old section of line 8 between La Motte-Picquet and Porte d'Auteuil was incorporated into line 10. Meanwhile, the section of Line 10 between Duroc and Invalides was transferred to line 14.Robert 1983, p. 131. Work began at the end of 1934. A new section was constructed linking the station La Motte- Picquet in the west to Duroc in the east with a new intermediate station, Ségur. The reconfiguration of the three lines' routes was planned so to minimize interruption while construction took place. The lines were shut down during a single night, between 26 and 27 July 1937. During this night, teams removed the rails on line 10 on the bend by Duroc, while at the same time others modified the rails by La Motte-Picquet. Still other teams changed the advisory signs of all involved stations, as well as the line maps in the stations and on the trains. On the morning of 27 July, line 10 was cut in two: from Jussieu to Duroc on one part, and from La Motte-Picquet to Porte d'Auteuil on the other. On 29 July, service began from Porte d'Auteuil to Jussieu.Robert 1983, p. 132. Sprague-Thomson stock with four cars at the terminus Porte d'Auteuil. Line 10 steadily began to mold to its present configuration from then on. One objective stood to link Porte d'Auteuil to Gare d'Austerlitz so to have a more coherent east–west route. The extension from Jussieu to Gare d'Austerlitz is 1,027 metres long. Construction began in 1934, however it ran into a number of difficulties resulting from its proximity to the Seine and the railroad tracks of Austerlitz-Gare d'Orsay under which a part of a tunnel had to be used. Construction of the infrastructure was completed on 14 September 1938, and the extension was opened to the public on 12 July 1939.Tricoire 1999b, p. 282.Robert 1983, p. 134. In September 1939, World War II broke out and the stations of Croix-Rouge and Cluny-La Sorbonne, considered too close to other stations, were closed. After these closures, the line encompassed 20 stations all together. On 3 June 1940, the bombing of Citroën factories damaged the tunnel of line 10 between Chardon-Lagache and Mirabeau. As a result, service was restricted to the section of Gare d'Austerlitz-Beaugrenelle, which became Charles-Michels. Three days later, a ferry on its own tracks was put into service running between Beaugrenelle and Porte d'Auteuil. Normal service was reestablished on 8 June.Robert 1983, p. 136. =Westward expansion= Boulogne-Pont de Saint- Cloud. There was a period of forty years between expansion projects. Finally, in 1977 a new expansion project began with the objective of improving the service to the borough of Boulogne-Billancourt. Although the borough was served in the south already by line 9, this expansion was justified as the suburban community was the most populated of the Île-de-France apart from Paris and the region is relatively important. The expansion work, with consisted of 2.3 kilometers of track and two new stations, began in February 1977 and took place mostly in open air. The two stations contain central platforms due to the narrowness of the rail network, spanning only twelve meters. This constraint required a specific type of construction so to assure the structural stability of the adjacent buildings with respect to the settling of the earth. The stable layer of chalk under the ground allowed for vaulted support structures. Excavation began with a concrete-filled trench, and the tunnel containing both rails was connected at the buckle of Auteuil by two tunnels each with their own track. For the first time on the Parisian network, the terminus did not contain a post-arrival turnaround due to the lack of space, so the maneuver took place before the station. The opening of this section, which is entirely underground, took place in two phases: the first expansion to Boulogne-Jean Jaurès was inaugurated on 3 October 1980, and the second section to Boulogne-Pont de Saint-Cloud was opened on 2 October 1981. Boulougne at first was serviced by only every other train, with the second train returning eastward via the loop at Auteuil. After 6:40 pm, all trains serviced the entire line.Tricoire 1999b, p. 250.,Robert 1983, p. 172. Following the opening of the train station Saint-Michel - Notre-Dame on line B of the RER in February 1988, the station Cluny-La Sorbonne, closed in 1939, was reopened after 50 years of being closed to assure a connection with lines B and C of the RER.Tricoire 1999b, p. 290. The line was modernized in 1974 with the establishment of the PCC. In 1975, the Sprague-Thomas train model was replaced by the MA 51 model already found on line 13, with those trains eventually being replaced by the MF 67 model on 15 June 1994. Line 10 is the only line, with the exception of the short 3bis and 7bis lines, that is not equipped with auto-pilot as the trains circulating at that time were not compatible with the technology. When the trains are eventually replaced with a compatible model, it is believed that the relatively low traffic of the line will not justify the investment in the installation of such a system.Tricoire 1999b, p. 273. Expansion projects No expansion project has been officially scheduled for line 10 through the year 2030 in the schéma directeur de la région île-de-France (SDRIF). Nevertheless, many projects have been proposed over the years. =Westward= One proposal consists of expanding line 10 from Boulogne – Pont de Saint-Cloud to the train station gare de Saint-Cloud, via an intermediate station at Parc de Saint-Cloud. Such an expansion would total about in total. Line 10 would then have a connection with the tramway T2 at Parc de Saint-Cloud and with the Transilien network of Paris-St-Lazare at the train station gare de Saint-Cloud. This westward expansion was not included in the SDRIF that was adopted in 2008, possibly due to the plan to create a southwestern branch of the Arc Express. =Eastward= A recurring request of passengers has been to extend line 10 eastward, traversing the Seine between gare d'Austerlitz and gare de Lyon to provide service to the latter as these two neighboring train stations are not linked to each other by any métro or RER line. The current configuration of the line and the substrate in the area of the proposed line would make such an extension difficult and therefore improbable. The extension most likely to be realized is along the RER C route (most likely under the rue du Chevaleret towards the 13th arrondissement, a neighborhood still poorly serviced despite the opening of line 14 to the station Olympiades and in consideration of the construction of a university in the Paris Rive Gauche neighborhood). In 2007, the Conseil de Paris deliberated on the importance of expanding line 10 to Ivry-sur-Seine. The SDRIF adopted in 2008 does not include this proposal, however it does state that optimization studies of service to Seine-Amont suggest that changes and/or expansions to lines 7, 10, and 14 may be necessary.\\" In October 2008, one of the sociétés d'économie mixte de Paris (SEMAPA) requested a feasibility study to be conducted on an expansion from place Gambetta to Ivry-sur-Seine. An independent study was done by the syndicat des transports d'île-de-France (STIF), in which the stations Chevaleret, Bibliothèque François Mitterrand, Bruneseau, Ivry – Nelson-Mandela, and Ivry-Place Gambetta were included.

It is dominated by the nearby settlements of Hythe and Dibden Purlieu. It is in the civil parish of Hythe and Dibden. It lies on the eastern edge of the New Forest in a valley, which runs into Southampton Water. History The name \\"Dibden\\" is from the Old English for \\"deep valley\\", although the village is only slightly lower than the land around it.Dibden, Old Hampshire Gazetteer It is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"Depedene\\" and was held by Odo of Winchester.Domesday Map - Dibden Prior to 1066 it had been held by \\"Ketil the Steersman\\" from King Edward. There was a saltpan and a fishery in the manor. The overlordship of Dibden belonged in the 12th century to Reynold de St. Valery, who died in 1166, and his son Bernard de St. Valery, who was killed at the siege of Acon in 1192, was probably the Bernard who was lord of Dibden in 1167.Victoria County History, (1912), A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5, Dibden Liberty Descending with his granddaughters to Robert Count of Dreux, it fell, with the rest of the honour of St. Valery, into the hands of the Crown, when it was given to Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall whose son Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall died in 1300 seised of a fee there which belonged to the honour of St. Valery. Dibden was thereafter held of the Crown. It was thus held in the reign of Henry VII of Arthur, Prince of Wales. The demesne of Dibden was at an early time split up into three parts: In the 12th century, Reynold de St. Valery gave a third of the manor to Edmund and Osbert de Dibden. Nicholas de Dibden held this third of Dibden of Edmund Earl of Cornwall in 1300. The Dibdens held their one third of the estate down to 1428, when Agnes, daughter and heir of Thomas de Dibden, inherited it. It passed to her daughter, Alice, who became the wife of Richard Waller of Groombridge, who died in 1486. It stayed in the Waller family until 1594 when William Waller sold the manor to William Webbe, who was already lord of the other two manors in Dibden. The part known as Dibden Hanger derived its name from the family first found holding it: John atte Hanger holding the land there in 1276. Richard son of Richard atte Hanger held this third of Edmund Earl of Cornwall in 1300. His son and namesake held it in 1346. By 1422 both this and the manor of Dibden Poleyn had come to the hands of John Hall, who granted them at that date to John Rogers. In 1544 Sir John Rogers sold the manors to William Webb, Mayor of Salisbury in 1523 and 1534. His son William Webbe died seised of the manors in 1585, leaving a son William, who in 1594 purchased the manor of \\"Dibden's Fee,\\" thus uniting the three estates. In 1300 Walter Nott held one- third of Dibden from Edmund Earl of Cornwall. Sixteen years later John Nott held it. In 1360 Walter Nott, parson of the church of Michelmersh, reserved a messuage and 2 carucates in Dibden from a grant of land which he made to Romsey Abbey. Shortly after this the estate came into the hands of the family which gave it the distinctive name of Dibden Poleyn. John Poleyn held it in 1369 and the Poleyn family was still holding it in 1413. By 1422 the manor had come, with Dibden Hanger, to the hands of John Hall, and thereafter followed the same descent. After 1594 the three estates were united. William Webbe owned it when he died in 1627, leaving an only daughter and heir Rachel wife of Sir John Croke of Chilton. Their son John Croke had succeeded by 1650. The Harris family owned the estate throughout the 18th century. James Harris dealt with the manor by fine in 1756, and his son James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury presented to the church in 1796. It passed out of their hands before the middle of the 19th century, and in 1862, it was sold to the Romsey Charity Commissioners who owned the manor into the 20th century. The church of All Saints, which was built about 1291, was destroyed in an air raid on 20 June 1940. It was restored and reopened on 2 April 1955 using much of the original material. Buried in the churchyard are members of the Lisle family, Royalists who fought against Monmouth in the Battle of Sedgemoor. At the beginning of the 20th century, Dibden consisted of a large number of farms scattered around the little cluster of buildings which still constitutes the village of Dibden. Like nearby Beaulieu, Dibden was at one time a liberty. The civil parish of Dibden was created in 1894.What is the Parish Council , Hythe and Dibden Parish Council The village of Hythe was taken from Fawley parish and added to Dibden parish in 1913.Relationships / unit history of Dibden, A Vision of Britain through Time Since the 1950s the villages of Hythe and Dibden Purlieu have grown enormously, and today the parish is dominated by those two settlements. In 1983 the parish was renamed to Hythe and Dibden, to reflect the importance of Hythe as a new focal point of the Parish.

In 1509, Papantzin fell seriously ill and became comatose. Believing her dead, the Texcocoans laid her in a tomb (unlike the Aztecs who burned their dead), but almost immediately, the mourners heard her cry out to be released. She related a vision, in which a luminous being with \\"crossed sticks\\" on his forehead led her to the shore of the Atlantic Ocean, where she saw several large \\"floating houses\\" (ships) approach from the horizon, having black crosses on their \\"wings\\" (sails) similar to that on her guide's forehead. The princess was informed that the men in the ships came from a distant land and would conquer the Aztecs and bring a knowledge of the One True God. When she related this vision to Moctezuma, he read the doom of his empire in it, and refused to ever speak to her again. Ten years later, the Spanish conquered Mexico, and Papantzin became one of the first natives to convert to Christianity. She was baptized in 1525 when the first Franciscan friars evangelized Texcoco.

P-selectin functions as a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) on the surfaces of activated endothelial cells, which line the inner surface of blood vessels, and activated platelets. In unactivated endothelial cells, it is stored in granules called Weibel-Palade bodies. In unactivated platelets P-selectin is stored in α-granules. Other names for P-selectin include CD62P, Granule Membrane Protein 140 (GMP-140), and Platelet Activation-Dependent Granule to External Membrane Protein (PADGEM). It was first identified in endothelial cells in 1989.  Gene and regulation  P-selectin is located on chromosome 1q21-q24, spans > 50 kb and contains 17 exons in humans. P-selectin is constitutively expressed in megakaryocytes (the precursor of platelets) and endothelial cells. P-selectin expression is induced by two distinct mechanisms. First, P-selectin is synthesized by megakaryocytes and endothelial cells, where it is sorted into the membranes of secretory granules. When megakaryocytes and endothelial cells are activated by agonists such as thrombin, P-selectin is rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane from granules. Secondly, increased levels of P-selectin mRNA and protein are induced by inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), LPS, and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Although TNF-a and LPS increase levels of both mRNA and protein in murine models, they do not appear to affect mRNA in human endothelial cells, while IL-4 increases P-selectin transcription in both species. The elevated synthesis of P-selectin may play an important role in the delivery of protein to the cell surface. In ischemic stroke patients, plasma P-selectin concentration was reported to be highly correlated to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity and tissue plasminogen activator activity.  Structure  P-selectin is found in endothelial cells and platelets where it is stored in Weibel-Palade bodies and α-granules, respectively. In response to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13, P-selectin is translocated to the plasma membrane in endothelial cells. The extracellular region of P-selectin is composed of three different domains like other selectin types; a C-type lectin-like domain in the N-terminus, an EGF- like domain and a complement-binding protein-like domains (same as complement regulatory proteins: CRP) having short consensus repeats (~60 amino acids). The number of CRP repeats is the major feature differentiating the type of selectin in extracellular region. In human, P-selectin has nine repeats while E-selectin contains six and L-selectin has only two. P-selectin is anchored in transmembrane region that is followed by a short cytoplasmic tail region.  Ligand  The primary ligand for P-selectin is P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) which is expressed on almost all leukocytes, although P-selectin also binds to heparan sulfate and fucoidans. PSGL-1 is situated on various hematopoietic cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, in which it mediates tethering and adhesion of these cells. However, PSGL-1 is not specific for P-selectin, as it can also function as a ligand for both E- and L-selectin.  Function  P-selectin plays an essential role in the initial recruitment of leukocytes (white blood cells) to the site of injury during inflammation. When endothelial cells are activated by molecules such as histamine or thrombin during inflammation, P-selectin moves from an internal cell location to the endothelial cell surface. Thrombin is one trigger which can stimulate endothelial-cell release of P-selectin and recent studies suggest an additional Ca2+-independent pathway involved in the release of P-selectin. Ligands for P-selectin on eosinophils and neutrophils are similar sialylated, protease-sensitive, endo-beta-galactosidase-resistant structures, clearly different than those reported for E-selectin, and suggest disparate roles for P-selectin and E-selectin during recruitment during inflammatory responses. P-selectin is also very important in the recruitment and aggregation of platelets at areas of vascular injury. In a quiescent platelet, P-selectin is located on the inner wall of α-granules. Platelet activation (through agonists such as thrombin, Type II collagen and ADP) results in \\"membrane flipping\\" where the platelet releases α- and dense granules and the inner walls of the granules are exposed on the outside of the cell. The P-selectin then promotes platelet aggregation through platelet- fibrin and platelet-platelet binding. P-selectin attaches to the actin cytoskeleton through anchor proteins that are still poorly characterized.  Role in cancer  P-selectin has a functional role in tumour metastasis similar to E-selectin. P-selectin is expressed on the surface of both stimulated endothelial cells and activated platelets, and helps cancer cells invade into the bloodstream for metastasis and provides local multiple growth factors, respectively. Moreover, platelets facilitate tumor metastasis by forming complexes with tumour cells and leukocytes in the vasculature, thus preventing recognition by macrophages. This is thought to contribute to the seeding of tumour microemboli in distant organs. In vivo mice experiments have shown that a reduction in circulating platelets could reduce cancer metastasis. The oligosaccharide sialylated Lewis x (sLe(x)) is expressed on the surface of tumor cells and can be recognized by E-selectin and P-selectin, playing on a key role in metastasis of the tumor. However, in the 4T1 breast cancer cell line, E-selectin reactivity is sLe(x) dependent while P-selectin reactivity is sLe(x)-independent, suggesting P-selectin binding is Ca2+-independent and sulfation-dependent. One of the sulfated ligands is chondroitin sulfate, a type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG). Its activity in tumor metastasis has been probed by the addition of heparin that functions to blocks tumor metastasis. In addition to GAGs, mucin is of interest in P-selectin mediated tumor metastasis. Selective removal of mucin results in reduced interaction between P-selectin and platelets in vivo and in vitro. Heparin has long been known to represent antiheparanase activity that is to keep an endoglycosidase from degrading heparin sulfate, one of the glycosaminoglycans, and to effectively inhibit P-selectin. Despite a striking effect of heparin on tumor progression shown in a number of clinical trials, the use of heparin as anti-cancer agent is limited because of its risk, which might induce adverse bleeding complications. Given those reasons, development of new compounds that target P-selectin is now emerging for cancer therapy. Among them, the inhibitory activity of semisynthetic sulfated tri mannose C-C-linked dimers (STMCs) to P-selectin was shown by the attenuation of tumor metastasis in vivo animal model, indicating the inhibition of interaction between tumor cell and endothelial cell is significant for blocking tumor dissemination. As a drug target Crizanlizumab is a monoclonal antibody against P-selectin. which has now been approved by Novartis on November 15, 2019 for the indication of vaso- occlusive crisis in sickle cell patients.

She first appeared on 9 August 2004 and departed on 29 June 2005. Foell previously starred in the serial as Kelly McCane in 1999 and Josie's cousin Angie Russell in 2002. Josie's storylines include meeting and forging a relationship with her cousin's daughter Tasha Andrews (Isabel Lucas), Becoming involved with Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin), having an affair with ex-boyfriend Marc Edwards (Christopher Hobbs), having the circumstances of a client's death being revealed and almost being murdered by Brett Macklin (Gerry Sont). Development Two years after departing the serial as Angie Russell, Foell rejoined the cast in 2004 to play Angie's identical cousin, Josie. Comparing the characters, Foell said \\"Angie was quite cold, whereas Josie is much warmer. She's a survivor who has been around the block a few times, but she's fair.\\" Storylines Josie appears when Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) and Dylan Russell (Brett Hicks-Maitland) track her down at her brothel in the city. Due to her profession, Irene wants Josie to keep her distance from Tasha Andrews (Isabel Lucas), the daughter of Josie's cousin, Angie. Josie's uncanny identical appearance to Angie causes a stir when she arrives in Summer Bay to connect with Tasha. Tasha gets along well with Josie but Irene is against her being in Tasha's life. Josie settles into Summer Bay and donates $2000 to the school and invests in the surf club and suggests naming a new bar \\"Noah's\\" - in honour of the recently murdered Noah Lawson (Beau Brady). Tasha's friends Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) and Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) are suspicious and accuse Josie of wanting Tasha's inheritance. Irene enlists the help of Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) for legal advice when Josie applies for guardianship of Tasha. Josie withdraws after Morag discovers a secret from her past. She then assists for Ian Osbourne (Andrew McFarlane), Tasha's biological father and his assistant Stafford McRae (Rohan Nichol) to plant surveillance cameras in the beach house, in order for Ian to keep an eye on Tasha. The cameras are soon exposed and Ian withdraws. Josie begins a relationship with business partner Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin) but gets cold feet when he professes his love for her and she breaks up with him as a result. Tasha concocts a scheme to get them back together by pretending to break up with her boyfriend Robbie Hunter (Jason Smith). The plan works and Josie and Jesse reunite. Josie later comforts Tasha when Ian rejects her in an act to prevent her becoming like his other children. Marc Edwards (Christopher Hobbs), Josie's ex-boyfriend arrives in Summer Bay. Although, she is now with Jesse, the two sleep together and Josie regrets it. Marc's continual presence in Summer Bay uneases her and matters escalate when he begins blackmailing her for money over her secret, the suspicious death of one of her clients. Josie reluctantly accepts Jesse's proposal of marriage and they are ready to marry but Marc presents Jesse with the video footage of him and Josie together and Jesse exposes the affair to the congregation and leaves town for several days. Following Marc's arrest as a suspect of being the Summer Bay Stalker, he is bailed and harasses Josie at a murder mystery party, where ironically he is murdered by Eve Jacobsen (Emily Perry), the real stalker. Josie is a suspect but is later cleared. She then leaves town and asks Tasha to leave with her but she declines. Josie returns a few weeks later, having gone into business with Brett Macklin (Gerry Sont). She soon discovers Brett is responsible for illegally dumping waste and relays the information to Stafford and arranges to meet him to organise a plan to bring Brett down, However, Stafford does not turn up and Brett arrives in his place and tries to kill her by pushing her off a cliff but is foiled and arrested. Josie has a short entanglement with Scott Hunter (Kip Gamblin) but it fizzles out and she decides to leave the bay once more and settles in Boston, Massachusetts. The following year, Josie invites Tasha, Robbie and their daughter Ella to join her over there. Reception Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury observed \\"Josie, the scarily- lookalike sister of Angie, has been in Home And Away for only five minutes but has certainly made her mark.\\". A writer from What's On TV described her as \\"twisted\\", and stated that Foell caused trouble twice in the show in both her roles as Angie and Josie. An Inside Soap reporter branded Josie's arrival played by Foell a \\"bonkers - but nonetheless brilliant\\" storyline.

The ship was destroyed in the United Kingdom's first nuclear weapon test, Operation Hurricane in 1952. Construction Plym was built to the Royal Navy's specifications as a Group II . She was laid down by Smiths Dock Co. at their yard in South Bank-on-Tees on 1 August 1942 and launched on 4 February 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 16 May 1943 as HMS Plym (K271) and was named after the River Plym in Devon, England which flows into the English Channel at Plymouth. Service history Plym saw extensive service on Atlantic convoy escort missions. Plym, along with , and , provided anti-submarine escort to the convoy WS-33 which arrived in South Africa from the United Kingdom on 9 October 1943 with critical reinforcements for service in Burma. =Operation Hurricane= Plym was used as the detonation platform for the UK's first nuclear weapon in Operation Hurricane. A 25-kiloton atom bomb was detonated a few seconds before 09:30 local time on 3 October 1952 approximately from the island of Trimouille in the Monte Bello Islands, Western Australia. Although data acquisition would have been simplified by detonating the bomb from a tower above the ground or sea surface, it was conducted aboard Plym in order to simulate the effects of a nuclear weapon being smuggled into a British harbour aboard a ship.

Although Basil's reign was a period of stability during the civil war that dominated the pocket empire during the second quarter of the 14th century, some of that conflict had its origins in his marital actions.  Life  Basil was a younger son of Emperor Alexios II of Trebizond and his wife Djiadjak Jaqeli. When his oldest brother Andronikos III assumed the throne in 1330 and killed his two brothers (Michael and George), Basil happened to be in Constantinople and escaped his brothers' fate. On the death of Andronikos III, his infant son Manuel II became emperor. However, Basil was invited from Constantinople to take the throne; Manuel was deposed in August 1332 and confined to a monastery. Basil purged the court of his brother and nephew's supporters (which included the megas doux Lekes Tzatzintzaios and his son the megas domestikos Tzambas), but the man he appointed as the new megas doux, John the Eunuch, revolted in favor of the deposed Manuel.William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204–1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 44 The revolt was crushed and to prevent further trouble the child was murdered in 1333, probably on Basil's order. Despite Basil's return, the factional strife continued. According to George Finlay, the great officers and principal nobles had become petty sovereigns, reducing the countryside to anarchy. The Scholarioi, the militia of capital, became so insubordinate that Basil had to hire foreign mercenaries to protect his person, but through their arrogance and corruption they rapidly made themselves and their master hated.Finlay, The History of Greece and the Empire of Trebizond, (1204–1461) (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1851), p. 418 Such was his unpopularity with the people of the city, that when a solar eclipse took place they took it for a sign of divine wrath and forced the emperor to seek refuge in the citadel and tried to pelt him with stones.Michael Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 21. Greek text and English translation in Scott Kennedy, Two Works on Trebizond, Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library 52 (Cambridge: Harvard University, 2019), pp. 11-13 On 17 September 1334, Basil formed a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos by marrying his illegitimate daughter Irene. The affection between the two soon cooled, and Basil took a mistress also named Irene, by whom he fathered four illegitimate children. Whether or not he was actually divorced from his wife remains uncertain, but there is an interesting letter from the Patriarch of Constantinople, John XIV Kalekas, to Gregory the metropolitan of Trebizond. In this letter the Patriarch reprimands the metropolitan, and all the other ordained men at Trebizond, for the wickedness they had allowed to take place to the injury of the holy canons, and orders them to resolve this problem on the pain of alienating the main body of the Church.Miller, Trebizond, p. 45 The local clergy, however, contented themselves with the pretense that they were actually honoring the legitimate empress in their services since they were honoring an Irene. The uneasy situation at the capital was exploited by the Turkmen Sheikh Hassan, who attacked Trebizond 5 July 1335. The fighting centered at the palisade of Saint Kerykios and on Mount Minthrion, but a providential rainstorm allowed the Trapezuntines to rout the attackers.Miller, Trebizond, p. 46 Basil died 6 April 1340, apparently poisoned by his legitimate wife Irene Palaiologina, who promptly seized the throne.Miller, Trebizond, p. 48 Children The children of Basil and his second wife, Irene of Trebizond, were:Miller, Trebizond, p. 60 # Anna, who married Andrei Konstantinovich, Grand Duke of Nizhny Novgorod- Suzdal in 1343. # Alexios of Trebizond (1327–c. 1349) # John, later renamed Alexios III (1338–1390) # Maria, who married Fahreddin Kutlug beg, Emir of Aq Qoyunlu in 1352.Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 52.

Biography Stained glass window designed by Petts at the 168x168px Tree of life stained glass window at St Peter's Church, Carmarthen Petts was born in the Hornsey area of north London but, despite a childhood illness limiting his education, an interest in art and Saturday morning lessons at the Hornsey School of Art led to him becoming a full-time student there in 1930. A British Institution scholarship allowed Petts to study at the Royal Academy Schools for two years from 1933, during which time he also took evening classes in printing at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. In 1935 Petts married the artist Brenda Chamberlain in London and the couple set up home near Llanllechid in north Wales, where they held two joint exhibitions of their art and supported themselves by creating and selling greeting cards and doing some part-time teaching in Bangor. With Chamberlain, Petts bought a hand operated printing press and set up the Caseg Press in 1937 to produce bookplates, greeting cards and prints of local scenes. Petts collaborated with the poet Alun Lewis on illustrations for a number of Welsh-language magazines before the latter died in the Second World War. At the start of the war Petts had registered as a conscientious objector and was required to undertake farm work away from Wales. Petts and Chamberlain separated in 1943 after which Petts volunteered to join a Royal Army Medical Corps Parachute Field Ambulance unit. He served in Europe and the Middle East during 1944 before transferring to the Royal Army Educational Corps. He taught art at an army college in Palestine before working as an army publications editor in Cairo. Returning to Wales Petts, and his second wife Kusha Petts, sought to re-start the Caseg Press and also undertook work for the Golden Cockerel Press. He helped to design the Lloyd George Museum at Llanystumdwy which for a time housed the Caseg Press's printing press. Although new equipment allowed the Press to produce a wider range of material than previously the Press ceased production in 1951 and Petts took a series of posts with the Welsh Committee of the Arts Council. Petts was elected to the Society of Wood Engravers in 1953 and became an Associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers & Engravers in 1957. Taking a post as a lecturer in design and crafts at the Carmarthen School of Art in 1957 allowed him to concentrate on working in stained-glass. In 1963, Petts designed and created a stained glass window featuring a Black Jesus for the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, following a racially motivated bombing that killed four African-American girls aged 11–14. Petts, was said to be horrified \\"as a father and as a craftsman\\" upon hearing the news. Working with the Western Mail to raise funds, Petts arranged donations from many thousands of Welsh people to pay for the window. The window was installed and dedicated in 1965. In 1970, the designs for the window were donated to the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. In 2013, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing, Petts's original designs were displayed at the National Library of Wales. In September 2018, it was reported that the church was concerned that Alabama's stormy weather would destroy the window and appealled to the public to raise funds to preserve it. Petts also created stained glass windows at the Brighton and Hove Reform Synagogue in southern England and for several churches and chapels in Wales including the Tree of Life window for St Peter's Church, Carmarthen. Petts was a member of the Arts Council of Great Britain between 1958 and 1961. In 1966 he was awarded a Churchill Fellowship. In later life Petts lived and worked in Abergavenny.

The story centers on lawyer Billy Halleck, who kills a crossing Gypsy in a road accident and escapes legal punishment because of his connections. However, the Gypsy's father places a curse on Halleck, which causes him to lose weight uncontrollably. King, who was overweight at the time of the novel's writing, created the novel's outline following an annual medical examination. Following the book's release, media outlets discussed the similarities between the works of Bachman and King. Eventually, bookstore clerk Stephen Brown, a fan of King's work, located evidence from copyright data held in the Library of Congress that Bachman and King were the same person. After the secret of King's pseudonym was revealed, sales of Thinner increased tenfold. In total, over three million copies of Thinner have been sold. Critical reception to Thinner was polarized; some reviewers disliked the authorship deception and pessimistic ending, while others held these same points as merits of the book. The literary style, however, was generally praised. A film adaptation was released in 1996. Plot Billy Halleck, a successful, arrogant, and morbidly obese lawyer, is distracted while driving across town by his wife Heidi giving him a handjob, and he runs over an elderly Gypsy woman as a result. Billy uses his connections within the police and the courtroom to get himself acquitted and avoid punishment. The Gypsy's father, Taduz Lemke, exacts vengeance by imposing a curse upon Billy outside the courthouse, and Billy begins to lose weight rapidly. Worried, Billy consults a series of doctors, suspecting cancer, but the doctors are unable to determine the cause of his weight loss. Later, Billy discovers that the judge who passed his acquittal is covered in scales, and the policeman who committed perjury on Billy's behalf has been struck with severe acne. Both men commit suicide. With the help of private detectives and Richie \\"The Hammer\\" Ginelli, a former client with ties to organized crime, an emaciated Billy tracks the Gypsy band north along the seacoast of New England to Maine. He confronts Lemke at their camp and tries to persuade him to lift the curse, but Lemke refuses to do so, insisting that justice must be done upon Billy. The Gypsies throw Billy out of their camp, but not before Lemke's great-granddaughter Gina shoots him through the hand with a ball bearing. Billy calls for help from Richie, who sends a mob doctor to treat Billy's hand and then arrives in person to terrorize the Gypsy camp. After Richie finishes with the Gypsies, Lemke agrees to meet with Billy. Lemke brings a strawberry pie with him and adds blood from Billy's wounded hand to it. The weight loss will stop for a short time, but then resume unless Billy passes the curse to someone else by getting them to eat the pie. Lemke implores Billy to eat the pie himself so that he may die with dignity. After finding Richie's severed hand in his car and learning that Richie has been murdered, Billy returns home and intends to give the pie to Heidi, whom he has come to blame for his predicament. The next morning, though, he finds that both she and their daughter Linda have eaten from the pie. Realizing that they are both doomed, he cuts a slice for himself so that he can join them in death. Background Thinner is partly based on an episode in Stephen King's own life. He weighed and was warned by his doctor that he needed to lose weight and stop smoking. Although he did in fact lose the weight, he was angered by the fact that the decision to lose weight was not really his own, but, he felt, had been forced on him by his doctor. He began to contemplate what would happen if someone were to lose weight and then be unable to stop losing weight—and the idea for Thinner began to germinate in his mind.

He wrote the first book about the Faroes, which was printed (and translated into English and German) and drew the first detailed map of the Faroe Islands. Biography Debes was born at Stubbekøbing of the island of Falster in Denmark. He graduated from school at Slagelse in 1647. He came to the Faroe Islands in 1652 as a curate. The next year he became a parish vicar in Suðurstreymoy and later he became the new head of the Latin school in Tórshavn. He was both well-educated and hard-working, and the school improved considerately during his time there. After he settled in Tórshavn he married Anne Rasmusdatter, widow of his predecessor, in accordance with local Faroese tradition. However, since his predecessor had left behind him not only a widow but also nine children, it meant that money was very scarce and therefore he was often in debt. This in turn meant that he owed money to the local trading monopoly. In 1658 Debes went on a journey to Copenhagen. The reason was a dispute between Debes and the bailiff Johannes Heidemann. Although an official war manifesto was never declared, Denmark and Sweden were at war. Therefore, in mid-journey the ship was taken over by the Swedes. Debes now became a prisoner in Gothenburg. Luckily, through his fine knowledge and preaching, Debes managed to win the trust of the commandant. This meant that Debes was released the following year. After his release he successfully reached Copenhagen according with his original plans. After his returned to the Faroe Islands, he was made a deputy rural dean. When King Frederick III of Denmark endowed the Faroe Islands to his favourite statesman Kristoffer Gabel (1617–1673), Debes entered a bitter feud with his administration who suppressed the islanders in various ways. There came considerable complaints from the islands' inhabitants of unjust treatment by the civil administration in Tórshavn. This included the persons in charge of the monopoly trade, the bailiff and others. Debes is chiefly known for standing up for islanders mistreated by those who abused their power. He tried several times to inform the central administration in Denmark of the wrongdoings, but was stopped every time by the bailiff. Eventually in 1673 he managed to get away from the islands to carry out his plan and this consequently improved the situation of the Faroes. During his stay in Copenhagen, Debes acquire his master's degree in 1673. After his return to the Faroe Islands, Debes died in 1675. Historical Contribution Debes has become best known for his book about the Faroe Islands, Færoæ et Færoa reserata, first published in Danish in 1673. It is one of the earliest books ever written about the Faroe Islands. It is an historical and scientific according, which also includes the first map of the Faroe Islands. Legacy In the novel The Good Hope by noted Faroese author William Heinesen, the main character the Rev. Peder Børresen is based on Lucas Debes. Heinesen received the Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1964 for the novel. In the story Heinesen had the difficult task of reproducing seventeenth-century Danish. He succeeded so well that he won the prize. It is considered by many to be his best work.

Graham, 'Depreux, Edouard Gustave', in David Bell, Douglas Johnson & Douglas Morris, A Biographical Dictionary of French Political Leaders since 1870, Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1990, pp. 116–7 A soldier in World War I, Depreux was injured in a gas attack, and was subsequently awarded the Croix de guerre. He joined the Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière (SFIO) at age 20, being influenced by the ideas of Jean Jaurès and Jean Longuet; he studied Philosophy, Law, and Humanities, before becoming a lawyer. After serving as a member of the Sceaux commune council in 1935, and as a council member for Seine (1938–1941), he joined the French Resistance in the fight against the Nazi German military occupation, and held a high-ranking position in the SFIO executive committee, being the editor of the illegal newspaper Le Populaire. After the liberation of Paris, Depreux became mayor of Sceaux (a position he would hold until 1959), and a member of the Assemblée Consultative Provisoire that served as the legislature of France prior to the creation of the Fourth Republic; he then was elected to the French Parliament for successive terms between 1946 and 1958.  As Minister and PSU leader  A Minister of the Interior between 24 June 1946 and 24 November 1947 (in the Ministries of Georges Bidault, Léon Blum, and Paul Ramadier), he imposed the voting of an Organic Statute of Algeria, confirming partial autonomy for the colony of Algeria. In 1947, he revealed the existence of an American-sponsored secret \\"stay-behind army\\" in France codenamed Plan Bleu. He was Minister of Education in Robert Schuman's first cabinet (February–July 1948). Hostile to the European Defence Community plan proposed by René Pleven, and highly critical of the colonialism accommodated by the SFIO, Depreux nonetheless led the Party's group in the French National Assembly on two occasions.

The film is based on Stephen King's 1984 novel of the same name (which he wrote under the pseudonym Richard Bachman) and stars Robert John Burke, Joe Mantegna, Lucinda Jenney, Michael Constantine, Kari Wuhrer, and Bethany Joy Lenz. Plot Billy Halleck is an obese, upper class lawyer living with his wife Heidi and their daughter Linda. Billy recently defended an underworld crime boss named Richie \\"The Hammer\\" Ginelli in court and is now celebrating his acquittal on a murder charge. Heidi, in an attempt to persuade him to forget about his obsession with food, attempts to give Billy oral sex as he is driving. Distracted, Billy accidentally runs over a Gypsy named Suzanne Lempke. He is acquitted in the subsequent proceedings by his friend Judge Cary Rossington. The local police chief Duncan Hopley also obstructs the case by committing perjury for Billy. Outraged by the injustice, Suzanne's father, Tadzu Lempke, places a curse on Billy on the steps of the courthouse by touching his face and uttering \\"Thinner\\". Soon afterward, Billy begins to lose weight rapidly, despite not working out or sticking to his diet. Heidi, fearing the weight loss may be due to cancer, calls Dr. Mike Houston, with whom Billy soon begins to suspect his wife is having an affair. Billy learns that Rossington and Hopley have also been cursed; Rossington has been metamorphosed into a lizard-like being, while Hopley develops purulent ulcers on his face and hands. Both Rossington and Hopley commit suicide. Billy tracks down the Gypsy camp and tries to reason with Tadzu; however, Tadzu is further angered and he makes the curse on Billy worse. Gina, Tadzu's great- granddaughter, uses her slingshot to shoot a large ball bearing which goes directly through Billy's hand, infuriating Billy into vowing revenge against Tadzu and the other Gypsies. Billy then enlists Ginelli to attack the Gypsy camp and persuade Tadzu to meet with Billy and lift the curse. Chanting a spell, Tadzu mixes Billy's blood into a strawberry pie. Tadzu states that if someone else eats the pie, the curse will kill them quickly and Billy will be spared. He urges Billy to eat the pie himself and die with dignity, but Billy refuses. Billy arrives home and gives Heidi the strawberry pie. She delightedly eats a piece, while Billy heads to bed, claiming exhaustion. The next morning, Billy finds Heidi's desiccated corpse next to him. He is gleeful to be free of the curse and of what he believes is his disloyal wife. However, when he goes downstairs, he discovers that his daughter Linda had eaten some of the pie for breakfast. At the same time, Bill discovers the news stating that Ginelli has been discovered dead under mysterious circumstance (with Billy believing the gypsies took revenge on him). Wracked with guilt and having nothing left to lose, he prepares to eat the rest of the pie. However, Billy is interrupted by Mike, who is at the door. Seeing Billy, Mike grows uncomfortable and struggles to explain his unannounced presence, somewhat confirming Billy's suspicions of an affair between Mike and Heidi. Billy invites Mike in for a piece of the pie and closes the door with a smirk.

This album somewhat continues in the style of Reifert's former band Death. Lyrically the band thrives heavily on horror and gore concepts; nevertheless these are not inspired directly by horror movies, although the title track is based on Stephen King's short story \\"Survivor Type.\\" The album was very influential for future death metal acts such as Cannibal Corpse, Entombed, and Dismember. It was also a pioneer of gore lyrics. The album features Steve DiGiorgio on bass. Various re-releases exist with different bonus tracks and bonus CDs. Also a different cover exists for this album, which depicts the point of view of the person receiving the autopsy. The album is notable for its bass sound which was mixed much higher than all the other tracks. To coincide with the album's 20th anniversary, Peaceville Records released a special two-disc edition of Severed Survival on February 23, 2009. It includes rare rehearsal and live material for a bonus disc as well as demo versions of two songs — \\"Mauled to Death\\" and \\"Human Genocide\\" — which did not make the final cut on the original album. Also featured in the package is a booklet with notes by the band themselves, detailing the history of Autopsy's early years, with rare photos and images.

Construction The second Alexandria (PF-18) was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1848) on 23 June 1943, at the American Ship Building Company in Lorain, Ohio; launched on 15 January 1944, sponsored by Mrs. J. Leslie Hall; and towed down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, Louisiana, where she was fitted out and then commissioned on 11 March 1945, with Lieutenant Commander C. G. Houtsma, USCG, in command. Service history Alexandria conducted shakedown and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in late March and early April. She concluded shakedown on 19 April and put into the Norfolk Navy Yard on the 22nd to begin post-shakedown availability. Her repairs were finished on 4 May, and three days later, the war in Europe ended. The latter event obviated the primary mission for which she had been constructed, prosecution of the Battle of the Atlantic against German U-boats. Thus, when she reported for duty with the Commander, Destroyers, Atlantic Fleet, on 15 May, the patrol frigate received an alternative assignment as a weather ship. After receiving modifications at the Charleston Navy Yard, she began weather patrol duty off the Newfoundland coast late in June 1945. That duty, broken only by a visit to Alexandria, Virginia, in late October and early November, lasted until February 1946 when the ship was declared surplus to the needs of the Navy. She arrived at the Boston Naval Shipyard on 12 February and remained there just under one month. On 12 March, Alexandria arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, where she was decommissioned on 10 April 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 21 May 1946. On 18 April 1947, the former patrol frigate was sold to the Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Company of Chester, Pennsylvania, for scrapping.

With a working life of more than 53 years on the German cabaret stage and 70 of his own programmes he was one of the most productive and successful representatives of literary cabaret in Germany in the 20th century. Life and work Hüsch grew up in the Niederrhein-Area near the Netherlands and had to suffer of 'pes adductus' until he was 11 years old. Because he could not play with other children, he became a loner and began to write. When he was 22, Hüsch began to study in Mainz, \\"but I did not study, I wrote cabaret pieces\\". In 1949 Hüsch married Marianne and they had a daughter named Anna. At the time, they did not earn enough money to feed the young family, and Hüsch moved to Stuttgart, where he obtained employment at the local radio station. He worked under the direction of Guy Walter as author, songwriter and radio commentator. In 1955 Hanns Dieter Hüsch started his first cabaret ensemble, 'Arche nova', which became famous in southern Germany and Switzerland. From 1965 on, Hüsch released phonograph records with literary cabaret pieces, chansons and poems - he sold more than 50 albums until his death. In 1967 he joined the left-wing German student movement and performed in Berlin on Burg Waldeck. But some elements of the student movement did not like Hüsch's non- violent attitude. They heckled his performances from June 1968 until August 1969 and \\"it was just as if your comrades told you that you are not good enough for the fight and that you have to give it up\\", said Hüsch. He was disappointed and hurt by their actions against his art, decided not to perform in Germany for years, and moved to Switzerland. In 1972 he returned to German cabaret stages and subsequently became one of the most productive and successful representatives of literary cabaret in Germany, with more than 200 performances every year. In 1985 his wife died, and Hüsch wrote his most successful programme ever: \\"Und sie bewegt mich doch\\"/\\"And yet she moves me\\". In 1988 Hüsch left Mainz and went to Cologne, where he met his second wife Christiane. In 1996 Hüsch contracted lung cancer, caused by his cigarette smoking, but survived. Until the end of 2000, he toured with his farewell programme \\"Wir sehen uns wieder\\" (\\"We will meet again\\") in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In 2001, a stroke ended his plan to play King Lear at the Staatstheater Dresden. Complications resulting from the stroke and cancer confined him to his home in Windeck near Cologne, where he was nursed by Christiane. Hanns Dieter Hüsch died 6 months after his 80th birthday. It is said that more than 3.5 million people have seen Hanns Dieter Hüsch's live performances from 1947 to 2000. He received the Bundesverdienstkreuz and, twice, the German Cabaret award \\"Deutscher Kleinkunstpreis\\"; he also received honorary citizenship of Moers and Mainz, the North Rhine-Westphalia culture prize, the 1995 Kassel Literary Prize, and the culture prize of Rhineland- Palatinate, as well as other honors.

The scratch reflex is a response to activation of sensory neurons whose peripheral terminals are located on the surface of the body.Stein, P. S. G. (1983). The vertebrate scratch reflex. Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology(37), 383–403 Some sensory neurons can be activated by stimulation with an external object such as a parasite on the body surface. Alternatively, some sensory neurons can respond to a chemical stimulus that produces an itch sensation. During a scratch reflex, a nearby limb reaches toward and rubs against the site on the body surface that has been stimulated. The scratch reflex has been extensively studied to understand the functioning of neural networks in vertebrates. Despite decades of research, key aspects of the scratch reflex are still unknown, such as the neural mechanisms by which the reflex is terminated.  Model systems and tools = Animal models and preparations = A brown bear scratching its body against a tree. A number of animal models have been used to study, understand and characterize the scratch reflex. These models include the turtle, cat, frog, dog, and a variety of other vertebrates. In these studies, researchers made use of spinal preparations, which involve a complete transection of the animal's spinal cord prior to experimentation. Such preparations are used because the scratch reflex can be elicited and produced without the involvement of supraspinal structures. Researchers focused predominantly on investigating spinal cord neural circuitry responsible for the generation of the scratch reflex, limiting the system of study. In studies of spinal preparations, researchers have experimented using preparations both with and without movement-related sensory inputs. In preparations with movement-related sensory inputs, the muscles and the motor neuron outputs to muscles are left intact, allowing sensory feedback from the moving limb. In preparations without movement-related sensory input, one of three strategies is used: # the axons of sensory neurons are cut by dorsal root transection; or # neuromuscular blockers are used to prevent contractions of muscles in response to motor neuron activity; or # the spinal cord is isolated in a bath of physiological saline. = Recording techniques = Electromyographic (EMG) and electroneurographic (ENG) techniques are used to monitor and record from animals during experiments. EMG recordings are used to record electrical activity directly from muscles. ENG recordings are used to record electrical activity from motor neurons and spinal cord neurons. These techniques have enabled researchers to understand the neural circuitry of the scratch reflex on a single-cell level.  Characteristics  = General = The scratch reflex is generally a rhythmic response. Results from animal studies have indicated that spinal neural networks known as central pattern generators (CPGs) are responsible for the generation and maintenance of the scratch reflex.Stein, P.S.G. (2003) Scratch reflex. The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks 2nd Edition, ed. by M.A. Arbib, MIT Press, Cambridge, pp. 999–1001Stein, P.S.G. (2004) Scratch reflex. In Encyclopedia of Neuroscience, Third Edition CD-ROM, ed. by G. Adelman and B.H. Smith, Elsevier, Oxford. One feature of the scratch reflex is that supraspinal structures are not necessary for the generation of the reflex. The scratch response is programmed into the spinal cord, and can be produced in spinal animals. Another feature of the scratch reflex is that the spinal CPGs which generate and maintain the reflex are capable of producing the reflex in the absence of movement-related sensory feedback. This discovery was made while studying animals with silenced afferent neurons from the scratching limb, meaning no movement-related sensory feedback was available to the spinal circuits driving the scratch. Amazingly, these animals were capable of producing a functional scratch response, albeit diminished in accuracy. When afferent feedback is provided, the scratch response is more accurate in terms of accessing the stimulus site. Recordings indicate that feedback modulates the timing and intensity of scratching, in the form of phase and amplitude changes in nerve firing. In studying the scratch reflex, researchers have named a number of regions on the surface of the body as they relate to the reflex. A pure form domain is a region on the surface of the body, that when stimulated, elicits only one form of the scratch reflex. A form is a movement-related strategy used by the animal to perform the scratch; for example, to scratch the upper back, humans are limited to one scratch form, involving the elbow raised above the shoulder to provide access to the upper back. In addition to pure form domains, there also exist a number of transition zones, which can be successfully targeted by more than one form of the reflex, and which usually lie at the boundary of two pure form domains. Researchers have also developed terms to describe the scratch reflex movements themselves. A pure movement is one in which only one form of the scratch response is utilized to respond to the stimulus. A switch movement occurs in a transition zone, and is characterized by the smooth switching between two different scratch forms in response to the stimulus. A hybrid movement is observed and occurs at transition zones as well, and is characterized by two rubs during each scratch cycle, where each rub is derived from one pure form movement. Research on hybrid and switch movements at transition zones indicates that the CPGs responsible for scratch generation are modular and share interneurons. For this reason, in both the switch and hybrid movements, the path of the moving limb is smooth and uninterrupted. Studies from EMG recordings have indicated that reciprocal inhibition between hip-related interneurons in the CPG for the scratch reflex is not necessary for the production and maintenance of the hip-flexor rhythm that is a key part of the scratch reflex. This research further supports the findings on switch and hybrid movements, which suggest a modular organization of unit generator CPGs used in combination to achieve a task. Another general aspect of the scratch response is that the response continues even after afferent input from the stimulated zone ceases. For a few seconds after the cessation of the scratch, the neural networks involved in the generation of the scratch reflex remain in a state of heightened sensitivity. During this period of increased excitability, stimuli normally too weak to trigger a scratch response are capable of eliciting a scratch response in a site specific manner. That is, stimuli, too weak to elicit the scratch response when applied in a rested preparation, are capable of eliciting the scratch response during the period of increased excitability just following a scratch response. This excitability is due, in part, to the long time constant of NMDA receptors. Research has also shown that voltage-gated calcium channels have a role in the increased excitability of spinal neurons. = Spinal = As described in the general characteristics above, the scratch reflex is programmed into the neural circuitry of the spinal cord. Initial experiments on the scratch reflex in dogs revealed that the spinal cord has circuits capable of summing inputs. This ability of the spinal cord was discovered when stimuli, on their own too weak to generate a response, were capable of eliciting a scratch response when applied in a quick succession. Additionally, studies involving successive spinal transections in a turtle model have identified that spinal CPGs are distributed throughout the spinal segments asymmetrically. Furthermore, the site specificity of the scratch response indicates that the spinal circuitry also has a built in map of the body. This allows the spinal CPGs to generate a scratch response targeted to the site of the stimulus independent of supraspinal structures. Research into form selection has revealed that form selection is also intrinsic to the spinal cord. More recent research suggests that form selection is accomplished using the summed activities of populations of broadly tuned interneurons shared by various unit CPGs. Additionally, intracellular recordings have illustrated that motor neurons receive at least two types of inputs from spinal CPGs. These inputs include inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), meaning that scratch CPGs are responsible for both the activation and deactivation of muscles during the scratch response. Very recent research suggests that the scratch reflex shares interneurons and CPGs with other locomotor tasks such as walking and swimming. The findings from these studies also suggests that mutual inhibition between networks may play a role in behavioral choice in the spinal cord. This finding is supported by earlier observations on the scratch reflex, which indicate that the scratch reflex was particularly difficult to induce in animals already involved in a different locomotive task, such as walking or swimming. = Supraspinal = While the scratch reflex can be produced without supraspinal structures, research indicates that neurons in the motor cortex play a role in the modulation of the scratch reflex as well. Stimulation of pyramidal tract neurons has been found to modulate the timing and intensity of scratch reflex. Furthermore, extensive research has identified the involvement of supraspinal structures in the modulation of the rhythmic elements of the scratch reflex. The current theory is that efference copies from CPGs travel to the cerebellum via spinocerebellar pathways. These signals then modulate the activity of the cerebellar cortex and nuclei, which in turn regulate descending tract neurons in the vestibulospinal, reticulospinal, and rubrospinal tracts. Presently, there is not much else known about the specifics of supraspinal control of the scratch reflex.

Founded in 1928 by Yoshisuke Aikawa, the group was originally a holding company created as an offshoot of Kuhara Mining Co.(became Nippon Mining & Metals Company; currently part of JXTG Holdings), which Aikawa had taken over as president of from his brother-in-law, Fusanosuke Kuhara. After the bankruptcy of the Kuhara zaibatsu following World War I, Aikawa reorganized its assets into Japan Industries or , Nissan for short. The group's core business was real estate and insurance with hundreds of member companies, including fisheries, mining companies, and is affiliated with Hitachi Group companies, as well as what Nissan is now known for—its automobile industry. After World War II, the zaibatsu was disbanded, and reformed into Nichiyo-kai, otherwise known as Nissan Group. Although the Nissan name was primarily known for its car manufacturing outside Japan, Nissan Motors was a comparatively small side business compared to its core real estate business until the real estate crash of the early 1990s (see Japanese asset price bubble). Like the similar subprime crisis, the crash dealt a devastating blow to the Nissan Group by leaving it with several hundred billions of dollars of debt. The Nissan Group has long since shed the majority of its real estate assets (which were sold to Mitsui & Co. and still operates as the Bussan Real Estate Company), and has focused on manufacturing and insurance. Nissan Motors was given more independence as French automotive manufacturer Renault bought a 38.8% stake in the company for $5.4 billion in 1999 and appointed Carlos Ghosn as CEO of the new Renault–Nissan Alliance. Nissan Motors' successful turnaround was attributed to CEO Ghosn's ability to detach it from its keiretsu connections and eliminate 23,000 jobs from the Japanese workforce.

It was located on along Interstate 135 near Phil Ruffin's Wichita Greyhound Park, which closed the same year. History The park was owned, developed, and operated by Thomas and Cheryl Etheredge doing business as Wild West World, LLC and Restoration Farms, Inc. They also owned the Prairie Rose Chuck Wagon entertainment venue in Butler County. The announcement for the park appeared in the Wichita Eagle on December 19, 2004. Groundbreaking began on August 15, 2005.http://www.wildwestworld.net/newsarticles.htm#na8 It was billed as the only all-western theme park in the world, and the first major one in Kansas.http://www.a2mediagroup.com/?c=146&a;=13412 The claim to being the only all-western one is a mere technicality because Frontier CityWelcome to Frontier City! in Oklahoma City, has one non-western-themed ride (Mindbender) in an otherwise western-themed park. According to the Hutchinson News the rides were off-the-shelf carnival attractions dressed up in a western facade. Closure On July 9, 2007, barely two months after the park opened, the owners filed for bankruptcy and closed it down. They cited lagging attendance and bad weather as the main factors for the decision, but experts also point to an inadequate business plan and a poor theming choice.http://www.kansascity.com/657/story/185691.html The Etheredges were also forced to close and sell the Prairie Rose Chuck Wagon. The park was for sale, and the owners publicly stated that they hoped to reopen it in the future.KAKE - HomePage However, no sale materialized. The fixtures, equipment, and materials were auctioned by Bud Palmer Auctions.Bud Palmer Auctions A few empty buildings are all that remain, but all remaining structures and landscaping were auctioned off on November 6, 2010 so that the site could be bulldozed and prepared for future development. Securities Fraud On April 19, 2009, Thomas Etheredge was arrested on 10 counts of securities fraud related to investments in the park totaling $800,000, much of which was raised from the members of Wichita's Summit Church. The Summit Church split from Immanuel Baptist Church, where Etheredge had also been a member, when pastor Terry Fox resigned, and the new church congregated in the Johnny Western Theater on the park grounds during construction.http://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/stories/2009/05/04/story5.html After the park filed bankruptcy, it was learned that Etheredge had previously served three years in prison for securities fraud in another investment scheme. He was convicted on February 10, 2010 on 7 counts of securities fraud.http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article1026992.html He was sentenced on April 2 to five years in prison,http://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article1028396.html and paroled on July 29, 2013.http://www.kansas.com/news/article1119561.html See also * List of defunct amusement parks  Joyland Amusement Park  Wonderland Park References External links  Wichita Eagle coverage of the Wild West World bankruptcy * Bud Palmer Auctions Web site (Bankruptcy auctioneer) Category:Amusement parks in Kansas Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2007 Category:Buildings and structures in Sedgwick County, Kansas Category:Defunct amusement parks in the United States Category:Western (genre) theme parks Category:2007 establishments in Kansas Category:2007 disestablishments in Kansas Category:Amusement parks opened in 2007 Category:Amusement parks closed in 2007 ","title":"Wild West World"},{"id":"3434781","text":"KOPB may refer to: *KOPB (AM), a radio station (1600 AM) licensed to Eugene, Oregon, United States *KOPB-FM, a radio station (91.5 FM) licensed to Portland, Oregon, United States *KOPB-TV, a television multiplex (channel 10) licensed to Portland, Oregon, United States ","title":"KOPB"},{"id":"3434785","text":"KFFX may refer to: * KFFX-TV, a television station (channel 11 analog/8 digital) licensed to Pendleton, Oregon, United States * KFFX (FM), a radio station (104.9 FM) licensed to Emporia, Kansas, United States ","title":"KFFX"},{"id":"3434795","text":"The Tintic War was a short series of skirmishes occurring in February 1856 in the Tintic and Cedar Valleys of Utah, occurring after the conclusion of the Walker War. It was named after a subchief of the Ute and involved several clashes between settlers and natives, mostly over the natives' theft of cattle because of drought.  Who  The Tintic War was between the Indians previously residing in the Tintic and Cedar Valleys and the settlers. Mormon settlers faced various battles against the Ute tribe that was already living in the valleys. The leader of the Indians was a sub-chief named Tintic.  Why  Originally the settlers and Indians got along fairly well. The war started out as small skirmishes between the settlers and Indians. Then the first battle occurred at Battle Creek. These occurred because the Indians had been displaced from their land by the settlers. During the winter they did not have the necessary resources to survive, and they started to starve. The Euro Americans invaded the area, and proceeded to establish mining communities. They depleted the land of timber, game, diverted the water, and most of the land's resources in general. The settlers did, however, establish successful livestock and agriculture endeavors on the land. The Indians were forced to start stealing from the settlers in order to survive. Brigham Young was one of the settlers, and he recounts the early troubles by stating, \\"They came pretty nigh starving to death last winter; and they now see, if they are driven from these valleys in winter, they must perish\\".  Outcome  The war concluded with the federal government intervening. They took the Utes from their land to the Uintah and Ouray Reservation. This occurred in the late 1860s and in the Uinta Basin. However, the issues did not resolve overnight. The government never actually bought the Ute lands. This caused issues that persisted after World War II. Then the Indian Claims Commission requested money for their confiscated lands.

With 100+ members part of the professional games industry working for the likes of Blizzard, Crytek, DICE, Gearbox Software, Rockstar Games, and Ubisoft, MapCore offers an opportunity for professionals and amateurs alike to socialise, learn, teach, and find talent.  Industry relevance  The community's members have had an enormous impact upon the games industry at large. The forum was founded by Gearbox creative director Mikey Neumann, and almost every major games industry heavyweight has at least one MapCore member working in-house; numerous MapCore members also either work for or have founded indie studios. As such it's possible to benefit from a wide range of informed perspectives when discussing games-related topics. MapCore now primarily attracts two groups: those who actively work in the games industry, and those who aspire to. Current professionals benefit from being able to talk to their peers outside of the professional environment, while budding developers get to learn and receive feedback from the professionals.  History  MapCore evolved from 1999's Anarchy Design, a games design-focused website and IRC community officially supported and hosted by the Counter-Strike development team. Due to the explosive growth of the community and the widespread popularity of the Half- Life engine as a platform for development of third-party modifications, Anarchy Design was revamped to include developers from projects beyond Counter-Strike and was renamed MapCore in order to suit the new direction of the site. The website was re-launched in August 2000 as an affiliate of the late GameFan Network, and partnered up with other sites in the creative community such as 3DPalette, GameArt, GFXArtist, and Skindom. The timing of this move was poor as the network came under fire for withholding advertising commissions from its affiliates months later. The magazine's online network dissolved, leaving MapCore without a home. MapCore continued to be based primarily on IRC for a short while, until the website was revived and the forum re-established in 2003 by Mike Neumann, David Marsh, and Patrick Krefting — and handed over to Ryan Williams several years later.  IRC & Discord MapCore began life as an IRC channel. In 2016, active member Bev had created a Discord server representing the Mapcore Community. By 2017, the server had amassed a large quantity of members and became an active hub for the community which prompted MapCore admin FMPONE to take ownership of the server, subsequently removing all moderation powers from Bev.

In many (but not all) coordinate systems, an event is specified by one time coordinate and three spatial coordinates. The time specified by the time coordinate is referred to as coordinate time to distinguish it from proper time. In the special case of an inertial observer in special relativity, by convention the coordinate time at an event is the same as the proper time measured by a clock that is at the same location as the event, that is stationary relative to the observer and that has been synchronised to the observer's clock using the Einstein synchronisation convention.  Coordinate time, proper time, and clock synchronization  A fuller explanation of the concept of coordinate time arises from its relationships with proper time and with clock synchronization. Synchronization, along with the related concept of simultaneity, has to receive careful definition in the framework of general relativity theory, because many of the assumptions inherent in classical mechanics and classical accounts of space and time had to be removed. Specific clock synchronization procedures were defined by Einstein and give rise to a limited concept of simultaneity.S A Klioner (1992), \\"The problem of clock synchronization - A relativistic approach\\", Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy, vol.53 (1992), pp. 81-109. Two events are called simultaneous in a chosen reference frame if and only if the chosen coordinate time has the same value for both of them;S A Klioner (2008), \\"Relativistic scaling of astronomical quantities and the system of astronomical units\\", Astronomy and Astrophysics, vol.478 (2008), pp.951-958, at section 5: \\"On the concept of coordinate time scales\\", esp. p.955. and this condition allows for the physical possibility and likelihood that they will not be simultaneous from the standpoint of another reference frame. But the coordinate time is not a time that could be measured by a clock located at the place that nominally defines the reference frame, e.g. a clock located at the solar system barycenter would not measure the coordinate time of the barycentric reference frame, and a clock located at the geocenter would not measure the coordinate time of a geocentric reference frame.S A Klioner (2008), cited above, at page 954. Mathematics For non-inertial observers, and in general relativity, coordinate systems can be chosen more freely. For a clock whose spatial coordinates are constant, the relationship between proper time τ (Greek lowercase tau) and coordinate time t, i.e. the rate of time dilation, is given by }} where g00 is a component of the metric tensor, which incorporates gravitational time dilation (under the convention that the zeroth component is timelike). An alternative formulation, correct to the order of terms in 1/c2, gives the relation between proper and coordinate time in terms of more-easily recognizable quantities in dynamics:This is for example equation (6) at page 36 of T D Moyer (1981), \\"Transformation from proper time on Earth to coordinate time in solar system barycentric space-time frame of reference\\", Celestial Mechanics, vol.23 (1981), pages 33-56.) in which: :U = \\\\sum_i \\\\frac{GM_i}{r_i} is a sum of gravitational potentials due to the masses in the neighborhood, based on their distances ri from the clock. This sum of the terms GMi/ri is evaluated approximately, as a sum of Newtonian gravitational potentials (plus any tidal potentials considered), and is represented using the positive astronomical sign convention for gravitational potentials. Also c is the speed of light, and v is the speed of the clock (in the coordinates of the chosen reference frame) defined by: where dx, dy, dz and dtc are small increments in three orthogonal spacelike coordinates x, y, z and in the coordinate time tc of the clock's position in the chosen reference frame. Equation () is a fundamental and much-quoted differential equation for the relation between proper time and coordinate time, i.e. for time dilation. A derivation, starting from the Schwarzschild metric, with further reference sources, is given in Time dilation due to gravitation and motion together. Measurement The coordinate times cannot be measured, but only computed from the (proper-time) readings of real clocks with the aid of the time dilation relationship shown in equation () (or some alternative or refined form of it). Only for explanatory purposes it is possible to conceive a hypothetical observer and trajectory on which the proper time of the clock would coincide with coordinate time: such an observer and clock have to be conceived at rest with respect to the chosen reference frame (v = 0 in () above) but also (in an unattainably hypothetical situation) infinitely far away from its gravitational masses (also U = 0 in () above).S A Klioner (2008), cited above, at page 955. Even such an illustration is of limited use because the coordinate time is defined everywhere in the reference frame, while the hypothetical observer and clock chosen to illustrate it has only a limited choice of trajectory.  Coordinate time scales  A coordinate time scale (or coordinate time standard) is a time standard designed for use as the time coordinate in calculations that need to take account of relativistic effects. The choice of a time coordinate implies the choice of an entire frame of reference. As described above, a time coordinate can to a limited extent be illustrated by the proper time of a clock that is notionally infinitely far away from the objects of interest and at rest with respect to the chosen reference frame. This notional clock, because it is outside all gravity wells, is not influenced by gravitational time dilation. The proper time of objects within a gravity well will pass more slowly than the coordinate time even when they are at rest with respect to the coordinate reference frame. Gravitational as well as motional time dilation must be considered for each object of interest, and the effects are functions of the velocity relative to the reference frame and of the gravitational potential as indicated in (). There are four purpose-designed coordinate time scales defined by the IAU for use in astronomy. Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB) is based on a reference frame comoving with the barycenter of the Solar system, and has been defined for use in calculating motion of bodies within the Solar system. However, from the standpoint of Earth-based observers, general time dilation including gravitational time dilation causes Barycentric Coordinate Time, which is based on the SI second, to appear when observed from the Earth to have time units that pass more quickly than SI seconds measured by an Earth-based clock, with a rate of divergence of about 0.5 seconds per year.A graph giving an overview of the rate differences (when observed from the Earth's surface) and offsets between various standard time scales, present and past, defined by the IAU: for description see Fig. 1 (at p.835) in P K Seidelmann & T Fukushima (1992), \\"Why new time scales?\\", Astronomy & Astrophysics vol.265 (1992), pages 833-838. Accordingly, for many practical astronomical purposes, a scaled modification of TCB has been defined, called for historical reasons Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), with a time unit that evaluates to SI seconds when observed from the Earth's surface, thus assuring that at least for several millennia TDB will remain within 2 milliseconds of Terrestrial Time (TT),IAU 2006 resolution 3, see Recommendation and footnotes, note 3.These differences between coordinate time scales are mainly periodic, the basis for them explained in G M Clemence & V Szebehely, \\"Annual variation of an atomic clock\\", Astronomical Journal, Vol.72 (1967), p.1324-6. albeit that the time unit of TDB, if measured by the hypothetical observer described above, at rest in the reference frame and at infinite distance, would be very slightly slower than the SI second (by 1 part in 1/LB = 1 part in 108/1.550519768).Scaling defined in IAU 2006 resolution 3. Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) is based on a reference frame comoving with the geocenter (the center of the Earth), and is defined in principle for use for calculations concerning phenomena on or in the region of the Earth, such as planetary rotation and satellite motions. To a much smaller extent than with TCB compared with TDB, but for a corresponding reason, the SI second of TCG when observed from the Earth's surface shows a slight acceleration on the SI seconds realized by Earth-surface-based clocks. Accordingly, Terrestrial Time (TT) has also been defined as a scaled version of TCG, with the scaling such that on the defined geoid the unit rate is equal to the SI second, albeit that in terms of TCG the SI second of TT is a very little slower (this time by 1 part in 1/LG = 1 part in 1010/6.969290134).Scaling defined in Resolutions of the IAU 2000 24th General Assembly (Manchester), see Resolution B1.9.

This type of kick is utilized in many different martial arts and is popular in both non-contact and full-contact martial arts competitions. The kick has many variations based on stance, leg movement, striking surface, and the height of the kick. Semi-circular kick A semi-circular kick is a round kick to forty five degree roundhouse kick (or \\"diagonal kick\\"). Most popular in kick-boxing, lethwei, and muay Thai, it can be used in almost every situation. With this kick, all parts of the opponent's body can be attacked and every kind of attack can be countered. File: semi1.jpgLow kick outside File: semi2.jpgLow kick inside File: circulaire10.jpgMiddle kick File: contre5.jpgLow kick in counter Karate methods Karate has many different methods of delivering their roundhouse kick (mawashi geri). The original method involved bringing up the knee, and then swiftly turning the hip over and snapping the leg outwards from the knee to deliver a strike with the ball of the foot. The ball of the foot was believed to be more effective and less dangerous than other methods. As the years have gone by, some karate schools also practice kicking roundhouse kick with the shin, another point of contact is with the instep (for safety). There are now more and more karateka practicing the 'cutting roundhouse kick'; this is where the karateka will lift their attacking leg higher than the intended target, they will then execute the kick in a downward cutting movement. Practitioners consider it a very effective method against the thigh. This was later supplemented in Masutatsu Oyama's Kyokushin karate with a similar technique, using the instep and using more rotation of the hip, as well as sinking the weight of the kicker into the target, to create more bludgeoning power. The target of this kick was primarily the neck. Oyama also taught roundhouse kicks to the thigh and ribs, using the shin as the point of contact. File: circulaire9.jpgMiddle-kick with rotation of the hips and body in the direction of the kick File:circulaire11.jpgMiddle-kick in counterattack File:couverture_high.jpgHigh-kick with the right leg With the blurring of modern martial arts differences, many other variations of the roundhouse kick are now practiced in traditional karate schools. Besides the traditional Full Roundhouse Kick and the sports Small Roundhouse Kick variation, the kick sometimes uses the heel to connect (heel roundhouse kick). The Roundhouse kick is also often executed with a surprising downward tilt from high up, in what has been often called \\"the Brazilian kick\\" (downward roundhouse kick) because of influence from Brazilian Kyoukushin Karateka such as Ademir de Costa and notable students such as Glaube Feitosa and Francisco Filho. The kick is regularly practiced with a straight leg as a \\"low kick\\" because of muay Thai and kickboxing influences (straight leg roundhouse). The kick is also executed in several different ways after a full spin-back (spin back roundhouse kick and 360 spin back roundhouse kick), due to Taekwondo influences. It is executed with exaggerated tilt of the upper body (body bent roundhouse kick and hand-to-floor roundhouse kick), from Capoeira influences.De Bremaeker, M. et al., The Essential Book of Martial Arts Kicks: 89 Kicks from Karate, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Jeet Kune Do, and others (Tuttle Publishing, 2010), Muay Thai method Thai-style roundhouse kicks used to attack low and middle targets As with many other muay Thai techniques, the roundhouse kick has gained wide popularity, being used extensively in K-1 kickboxing and mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions due to its effectiveness in inflicting damage to the opponent. A properly executed muay Thai roundhouse kick has been compared by many martial artists to being struck by a baseball bat. Most Western muay Thai clubs and practitioners avoid the term roundhouse kick, instead using the term angle kick (or side-angle kick and occasionally rising kick). The muay Thai roundhouse (or angle) kick is generally used in varying levels (low, middle, high) to inflict damage to different parts of the opponent's body. Low (or lowpoint) kicks generally target the thigh just above the knee joint for the purpose of weakening the leg, limiting the opponent's mobility, reducing their ability to use it for forceful kicks, or potentially rendering them unable to stand on the leg altogether. Muay Thai practitioners are taught to repeatedly strike the same point on the thigh to increase the cumulative effect of low kicks as a match proceeds. Some Thai camps emphasize targeting the inner thigh to compress the femoral artery and to shock the opponent weakening his or her fighting ability. Middle (midpoint or midsection) kicks target the area above the hip bone and can damage the opponent's ribs and liver. High (or highpoint) kicks target the opponent's head or neck; they are often responsible for knockouts in competition. Some Thai camps emphasize targeting the side of the neck with the high angle kick cutting down from its highest point to compress the carotid artery and so shock the opponent, weakening his or her fighting ability or knocking him out. There are several traits which give the muay Thai roundhouse a very different feel and look. The main methodological difference is that the hips are rotated into the kick in order to convey more moment of inertia in the kick, and the abdominal muscles are strongly recruited in the act of rotation. Instead of a snapping kick, the combined action of the leg and hips creates a kick that is much more devoted to its momentum. The person delivering the kick will also raise up on the ball of his or her foot while he or she kicks, mainly to allow for greater pivoting/turning speed, and increased power. Muay Thai roundhouse kicks use the shin to make contact with the target instead of the ball or instep. This further adds to the structure of the kick, as the shin is more durable than the foot. Using the shin reduces the kick's reach, but allows it to be thrown within punching range. Virtually all muay Thai camps teach the roundhouse or angle kick with the striking leg remaining passive (mostly with the leg allowed to bend slightly but some camps teaching that the knee should be locked except to close range kicking) and not using the pivot of the lower striking leg around the knee found in most other martial arts. The power is instead entirely created by the rotation of the supporting leg and hips; akin to swinging a baseball bat. The practical difference is the objective of the kick. A standard karate or taekwondo roundhouse kick has one snap the instep at the objective, but a Muay Thai roundhouse uses the combined momentum generated by the leg and hip for more power. Taekwondo method The taekwondo roundhouse kick, known as dollyŏ chagi, is performed by first drawing the knee straight up in a \\"chamber\\" position. This chamber, identical to the chamber of many taekwondo kicks (front kick, side kick, etc.) is utilized so that the opponent cannot guess which kick will be thrown. This differentiates it from muay Thai and other roundhouse kicks, which tend to incorporate rotation before or during the rising of the knee. The knee is then rotated so that it is nearly parallel to the ground (counterclockwise for the right leg roundhouse) and the kicking hip is simultaneously rotated towards the opponent. The rotation of the hip, combined with the snapping of the leg forward, gives the kick its power. The striking surface is the instep or the ball of the foot. In this way taekwondo differs from Chinese sanshou, where the striking surface is the shin. This is also called an \\"off the line\\" or \\"rear leg\\" roundhouse kick. The roundhouse kick can also be thrown from the rear leg towards the target and strike with the lower shin or the instep. This method is to get a quick strike on the opponent before they see it coming. The kick is swung and then snapped in front of the practitioner to give them more power and velocity. The taekwondo kicking method is unique on its own. A similar kick is the front leg roundhouse, or \\"fast kick.\\" To begin the front leg roundhouse kick, the leading leg is chambered, then rotated and snapped towards the opponent in the manner described above. The fast kick version is done by skipping forward with the rear leg, moving the kicker towards the opponent while simultaneously chambering and snapping the front leg roundhouse. This method was used by early American full-contact karateka Bill Wallace, a student of taekwondo as well as karate, to great effect. The front leg kick is generally weaker than the rear leg roundhouse because the hip does not rotate as far; however, it is also generally faster because the leg travels a shorter distance before striking the opponent. Chinese wushu: sanshou/sanda method The variation of the \\"roundhouse kick\\" or 鞭腿 found in Chinese wushu's full contact portion of sanshou/sanda impacts with the ankle or instep.

Roundhouse kicks are utilized a lot in puroresu competition; better known as Japanese professional wrestling. Many of the athletes have knowledge in striking sports and tend to have the roundhouse kick in their wrestling style. Toshiaki Kawada is known for his extremely hard hitting roundhouse kicks. KENTA is known for his powerful roundhouse kicks to the head and chest of his opponents. Takashi Sugiura often uses low roundhouse kicks to the back of his opponent. It is often utilized in shoot-style wrestling competition, leading to variants being called shoot kicks.

The brand ceased to exist after it was phased out by Woolworths in 2011. History Tandy was founded in the United States in 1919 as Tandy Leather Company. In 1963, Tandy changed its business to electronics when it acquired control of RadioShack, a forty year old electronics business with nine stores and a mail order arm. From 1963 to 1986, RadioShack grew to more than 6900 stores and dealers in the United States, with a further 2,100 stores and dealers in Canada, England, Europe and Australia. In November 1973, the first RadioShack style Tandy stores in Australia opened for business. They were administered from a rented office and warehouse in the Sydney suburb of Rydalmere. Tandy met with stiff opposition from local businessman Dick Smith who complained > \\"Tandy are prepared to operate for a period of five years at a financial > loss to set up in Australia ... This is not free enterprise, it is not > competition, it is totally unfair ... why should a foreign firm be allowed > by the Australian Government to take over the Australian market from the > Australian people and remain 99 per cent foreign owned?\\" Tandy quickly established stores in major towns and suburbs across Australia and had a major presence by 1980. Many independent electrical businesses in smaller towns added Tandy products to their range. It was incorporated in 1982, under the name Tandy Australia Limited. In 1983, as a direct result of the rapid expansion, Tandy built and moved into a $6 million Home Office and Distribution Centre located at Mt. Druitt in the west of Sydney. Tandy in Australia were especially well known for their audio and radio products, most of which carried their Realistic own brand label. Their business expanded rapidly during the CB radio boom of the middle of the 1970s, and the personal computer boom later. Their TRS-80 series of computers was particularly well known. In 1986, Tandy Corporation decided to create a new corporation to manage its international operations. Tandy spun off retail operations in Canada, Australia, Great Britain and Europe under a new company, International Tandy, with the object of giving the companies in those countries more autonomy for better growth and profitability. At the time, there were 350 stores in Australia. Tandy's position in the market had some similarities with its local competitor, Dick Smith Electronics. Both companies produced a substantial annual catalogue, though Tandy's was more consumer-oriented with no data section. Its CB radio ranges were similar to DSE but its amateur radio gear range was limited, focusing on scanners and shortwave radio. In 2000, Tandy launched its ecommerce business, as announced in November 1999. Acquisition by Woolworths In April 2001, Woolworths Limited acquired Tandy Electronics for $112.6 million from InterTAN Australia Limited (a subsidiary of International Tandy). Tandy had 222 stores at the time. Despite also owning Dick Smith Electronics, the Tandy stores continued to trade as separate entities until the phasing out of the Tandy brand by Woolworths in 2011.

Spectra are scaled and shifted for clarity. A difference in selection rules is visible: Some bands appear only in the bulk-phase Raman spectrum or only in the SERS spectrum. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy or surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a surface-sensitive technique that enhances Raman scattering by molecules adsorbed on rough metal surfaces or by nanostructures such as plasmonic-magnetic silica nanotubes.Xu, X., Li, H., Hasan, D., Ruoff, R. S., Wang, A. X. and Fan, D. L. (2013), Near-Field Enhanced Plasmonic- Magnetic Bifunctional Nanotubes for Single Cell Bioanalysis. Adv. Funct. Mater.. The enhancement factor can be as much as 1010 to 1011, which means the technique may detect single molecules. History SERS from pyridine adsorbed on electrochemically roughened silver was first observed by Martin Fleischmann, Patrick J. Hendra and A. James McQuillan at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southampton, UK in 1973. This initial publication has been cited over 4000 times. The 40th Anniversary of the first observation of the SERS effect has been marked by the Royal Society of Chemistry by the award of a National Chemical Landmark plaque to the University of Southampton. In 1977, two groups independently noted that the concentration of scattering species could not account for the enhanced signal and each proposed a mechanism for the observed enhancement. Their theories are still accepted as explaining the SERS effect. Jeanmaire and Richard Van Duyne proposed an electromagnetic effect, while Albrecht and Creighton proposed a charge-transfer effect. Rufus Ritchie, of Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Health Sciences Research Division, predicted the existence of the surface plasmon. Mechanisms The exact mechanism of the enhancement effect of SERS is still a matter of debate in the literature. There are two primary theories and while their mechanisms differ substantially, distinguishing them experimentally has not been straightforward. The electromagnetic theory proposes the excitation of localized surface plasmons, while the chemical theory proposes the formation of charge-transfer complexes. The chemical theory is based on resonance Raman spectroscopy, in which the frequency coincidence (or resonance) of the incident photon energy and electron transition greatly enhances Raman scattering intensity. Research in 2015 on a more powerful extension of the SERS technique called SLIPSERS (Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous SERS) has further supported the EM theory.http://www.kurzweilai.net/single-molecule-detection-of-contaminants- explosives-or-diseases-now-possible =Electromagnetic theory= The increase in intensity of the Raman signal for adsorbates on particular surfaces occurs because of an enhancement in the electric field provided by the surface. When the incident light in the experiment strikes the surface, localized surface plasmons are excited. The field enhancement is greatest when the plasmon frequency, ωp, is in resonance with the radiation (\\\\omega = \\\\omega_p/\\\\sqrt 3 for spherical particles). In order for scattering to occur, the plasmon oscillations must be perpendicular to the surface; if they are in-plane with the surface, no scattering will occur. It is because of this requirement that roughened surfaces or arrangements of nanoparticles are typically employed in SERS experiments as these surfaces provide an area on which these localized collective oscillations can occur.Smith, E.; Dent, G., Modern Raman Spectroscopy: A Practical Approach. John Wiley and Sons: 2005 SERS enhancement can occur even when an excited molecule is relatively far apart from the surface which hosts metallic nanoparticles enabling surface plasmon phenomena. The light incident on the surface can excite a variety of phenomena in the surface, yet the complexity of this situation can be minimized by surfaces with features much smaller than the wavelength of the light, as only the dipolar contribution will be recognized by the system. The dipolar term contributes to the plasmon oscillations, which leads to the enhancement. The SERS effect is so pronounced because the field enhancement occurs twice. First, the field enhancement magnifies the intensity of incident light, which will excite the Raman modes of the molecule being studied, therefore increasing the signal of the Raman scattering. The Raman signal is then further magnified by the surface due to the same mechanism that excited the incident light, resulting in a greater increase in the total output. At each stage the electric field is enhanced as E2, for a total enhancement of E4.Moskovits, M., Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy: a Brief Perspective. In Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering – Physics and Applications, 2006; pp. 1–18 The enhancement is not equal for all frequencies. For those frequencies for which the Raman signal is only slightly shifted from the incident light, both the incident laser light and the Raman signal can be near resonance with the plasmon frequency, leading to the E4 enhancement. When the frequency shift is large, the incident light and the Raman signal cannot both be on resonance with ωp, thus the enhancement at both stages cannot be maximal. The choice of surface metal is also dictated by the plasmon resonance frequency. Visible and near-infrared radiation (NIR) are used to excite Raman modes. Silver and gold are typical metals for SERS experiments because their plasmon resonance frequencies fall within these wavelength ranges, providing maximal enhancement for visible and NIR light. Copper's absorption spectrum also falls within the range acceptable for SERS experiments. Platinum and palladium nanostructures also display plasmon resonance within visible and NIR frequencies. =Chemical theory= Resonance Raman spectroscopy explains the huge enhancement of Raman scattering intensity. Intermolecular and intramolecular charge transfers significantly enhance Raman spectrum peaks. In particular, the enhancement is huge for species adsorbing the metal surface due to the high-intensity charge transfers from the metal surface with wide band to the adsorbing species. This resonance Raman enhancement is dominant in SERS for species on small nanoclusters with considerable band gaps, because surface plasmon appears only in metal surface with near-zero band gaps. This chemical mechanism probably occurs in concert with the electromagnetic mechanism for metal surface. Surfaces While SERS can be performed in colloidal solutions, today the most common method for performing SERS measurements is by depositing a liquid sample onto a silicon or glass surface with a nanostructured noble metal surface. While the first experiments were performed on electrochemically roughened silver, now surfaces are often prepared using a distribution of metal nanoparticles on the surface as well as using lithography or porous silicon as a support. Two dimensional silicon nanopillars decorated with silver have also been used to create SERS active substrates. The most common metals used for plasmonic surfaces are silver and gold; however, aluminium has recently been explored as an alternative plasmonic material, because its plasmon band is in the UV region, contrary to silver and gold. Hence, there is great interest in using aluminium for UV SERS. It has, however, surprisingly also been shown to have a large enhancement in the infrared, which is not fully understood. In the current decade, it has been recognized that the cost of SERS substrates must be reduced in order to become a commonly used analytical chemistry measurement technique. To meet this need, plasmonic paper has experienced widespread attention in the field, with highly sensitive SERS substrates being formed through approaches such as soaking, in-situ synthesis, screen printing and inkjet printing. The shape and size of the metal nanoparticles strongly affect the strength of the enhancement because these factors influence the ratio of absorption and scattering events.Aroca, R., Surface-enhanced Vibrational Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons (2006) There is an ideal size for these particles, and an ideal surface thickness for each experiment. Particles that are too large allow the excitation of multipoles, which are nonradiative. As only the dipole transition leads to Raman scattering, the higher-order transitions will cause a decrease in the overall efficiency of the enhancement. Particles that are too small lose their electrical conductance and cannot enhance the field. When the particle size approaches a few atoms, the definition of a plasmon does not hold, as there must be a large collection of electrons to oscillate together. An ideal SERS substrate must possess high uniformity and high field enhancement. Such substrates can be fabricated on a wafer scale and label-free superresolution microscopy has also been demonstrated using the fluctuations of surface enhanced Raman scattering signal on such highly uniform, high-performance plasmonic metasurfaces. Applications SERS substrates are used to detect the presence of low-abundance biomolecules, and can therefore detect proteins in bodily fluids. Early detection of pancreatic cancer biomarkers was accomplished using SERS-based immunoassay approach. A SERS-base multiplex protein biomarker detection platform in a microfluidic chip is used to detect several protein biomarkers to predict the type of disease and critical biomarkers and increase the chance of diagnosis between diseases with similar biomarkers (PC, OVC, and pancreatitis). This technology has been utilized to detect urea and blood plasma label free in human serum and may become the next generation in cancer detection and screening. The ability to analyze the composition of a mixture on the nano scale makes the use of SERS substrates beneficial for environmental analysis, pharmaceuticals, material sciences, art and archeological research, forensic science, drug and explosives detection, food quality analysis, and single algal cell detection. SERS combined with plasmonic sensing can be used for high-sensitivity and quantitative analysis of small molecules in human biofluids, quantitative detection of biomolecular interaction, and to study redox processes at the single molecule level. Immunoassays SERS-based immunoassays can be used for detection of low- abundance biomarkers. For example, antibodies and gold particles can be used to quantify proteins in serum with high sensitivity and specificity. =Oligonucleotide targeting= SERS can be used to target specific DNA and RNA sequences using a combination of gold and silver nanoparticles and Raman- active dyes, such as Cy3. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) can be identified using this technique. The gold nanoparticles facilitate the formation of a silver coating on the dye-labeled regions of DNA or RNA, allowing SERS to be performed. This has several potential applications: For example, Cao et al. report that gene sequences for HIV, Ebola, Hepatitis, and Bacillus Anthracis can be uniquely identified using this technique. Each spectrum was specific, which is advantageous over fluorescence detection; some fluorescent markers overlap and interfere with other gene markers. The advantage of this technique to identify gene sequences is that several Raman dyes are commercially available, which could lead to the development of non- overlapping probes for gene detection. Selection rules The term surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy implies that it provides the same information that traditional Raman spectroscopy does, simply with a greatly enhanced signal. While the spectra of most SERS experiments are similar to the non-surface enhanced spectra, there are often differences in the number of modes present. Additional modes not found in the traditional Raman spectrum can be present in the SERS spectrum, while other modes can disappear. The modes observed in any spectroscopic experiment are dictated by the symmetry of the molecules and are usually summarized by Selection rules. When molecules are adsorbed to a surface, the symmetry of the system can change, slightly modifying the symmetry of the molecule, which can lead to differences in mode selection. One common way in which selection rules are modified arises from the fact that many molecules that have a center of symmetry lose that feature when adsorbed to a surface. The loss of a center of symmetry eliminates the requirements of the mutual exclusion rule, which dictates that modes can only be either Raman or infrared active. Thus modes that would normally appear only in the infrared spectrum of the free molecule can appear in the SERS spectrum. A molecule's symmetry can be changed in different ways depending on the orientation in which the molecule is attached to the surface. In some experiments, it is possible to determine the orientation of adsorption to the surface from the SERS spectrum, as different modes will be present depending on how the symmetry is modified.

History During the Zhou dynasty (1122–256 BCE), students were required to master the \\"liù yì\\" (六藝) (Six Arts): # Rites (禮) # Music (樂) # Archery (射) # Chariotry (御) # Calligraphy (書) # Mathematics (數) Men who excelled in these six arts were thought to have reached the state of perfection, a perfect gentleman. The Six Arts were practiced by scholars and they already existed before Confucius, but became a part of Confucian philosophy. As such, Xu Gan (170–217 CE) discusses them in the Balanced Discourses. The Six Arts were practiced by the 72 disciples of Confucius. The Six Arts concept developed during the pre-imperial period. It incorporated both military and civil components. The civil side was later associated with the Four Arts (qin playing, chess, calligraphy and painting). However, the latter was more a leisure characteristic for the late imperial time. It evidently overlaps with the Six Arts, since the qin epitomized music, the chess (Go, a board-game known by its Japanese name) related to the military strategy, while calligraphy dealt with the aesthetics of writing and the character cultivation (the rites).  Influence  The requirement of students to master the six arts parallels the Western concept of the Renaissance man. The emphasis on the Six Arts bred Confucian gentlemen who knew more than just canonical scholarship. The classical interest practical scholarship invigorated Chinese mathematics, astronomy, and science (e.g. Liu Hui, Zu Chongzhi, Shen Kuo, Yang Hui, Zhu Shijie). This tradition receded after the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), when neo-Confucianism underscored the importance of the four books Analects over the other arts and technical fields. At the Guozijian, the Imperial University, law, math, calligraphy, equestrianism, and archery were emphasized by the Ming Hongwu Emperor in addition to Confucian classics and also required in the Imperial Examinations. Archery and equestrianism were added to the exam by Hongwu in 1370 like how archery and equestrianism were required for non- military officials at the 武舉 College of War in 1162 by the Song Emperor Xiaozong. The area around the Meridian Gate of Nanjing was used for archery by guards and generals under Hongwu. By the Qing dynasty, the Chinese specialists were not able to manage the lunar calendar accurately, and the calendar was going out of phase with nature. This was a great embarrassment to the Chinese court, as the adherence to the lunar calendars by the vassal states was a recognition of the sovereignty of the Chinese court over them. Western astronomical expertise (see Jesuit China missions) was welcomed much as an aftermath of Chinese interest in astronomy and mathematics, partially formulated in the classical Six Arts agenda.

She also had a J-pop career in the late 1980s to the early 1990s. Career =Early life= Aya Sugimoto grew up in Kyoto under a \\"strict\\" upbringing, making her first foray into the world of entertainment when she began modeling at age 15. Encouraged by her management company, she decided to embark on a singing career. =Singer and author (1988–2003)= She released nine singles and six albums between 1988 and 1991, including the number 1 hits \\"Boys\\" and \\"Gorgeous\\". Her most recent album in 1995 (Femme Fatale) followed a hiatus following her marriage to music producer Toshinori Numata. As writer of many of her own lyrics which included erotic themes, she decided to turn her attention to writing erotic novels, publishing works including The Rules of Supreme Pleasure, Immoral and the book-length 2004 essay, Orgasm Life. In July 2003, Sugimoto went through a high-profile divorce from her husband of 11 years. Sugimoto claimed that there was not enough sex in her marriage, and the term \\"sexless divorce\\" became a catch-phrase among frustrated wives in Japan. Sugimoto said, \\"I didn't think it was such a big deal. I actually thought that it was a healthier reason for wanting out than a lot of other mud-dragging type of divorces.\\" =Acting (2003–)= After the notoriety she gained from the publicity surrounding the divorce, Sugimoto was one of the outspoken guests on the Friday late-night TV Tokyo talk show, Yearnings of the Goddess. As an actress, she then appeared in the role of Queen Beryl in the 2003-2004 TV series Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon, a live action adaptation of the 1990s anime series. In 2004, she starred in director Takashi Ishii's remake of Oniroku Dan's S&M; novel, Flower and Snake. Working with bondage master Go Arisue, she reprised the role first played by Naomi Tani in director Masaru Konuma's version of the novel, Flower and Snake (1974). She spent approximately 75% of her screen time unclothed and participating in humiliating sexual acts but went on in the same year to be voted the second sexiest woman in Asia by Playboy magazine, beaten only by Zhang Ziyi. In 2006 Sugimoto appeared alongside Japanese adult actress Sora Aoi in the midnight manga-inspired comedy-drama Shimokita Glory Days on TV Tokyo. The show also featured other adult actresses such as Yuma Asami in a story about a male college student moving to Tokyo and living in a shared house of women. Each of the twelve episodes were presented as 'lessons' which featured sexual themes and nudity. Sugimoto stated in an interview about the series that “society can’t consist only of ‘high-quality’ elements, and that's also true for visual eroticism as well.” In September 2008, Sugimoto became the first Japanese model in PETA's international nude anti-fur campaign.JapanToday In November 2008 she performed a tango interpretation of the story of Sada Abe, a notorious prostitute who asphyxiated and castrated her lover. Titled Tango Nostalgia, the show was an extension of her performances on Nippon Television's Urinari Geinojin Shako Dansu-bu (ウリナリ芸能人社交ダンス部,\\"Urinari Geinojin Shako Dansu-bu - Official Site\\" a Japanese TV show similar to Dancing with the Stars in which she performed with comedian Kiyotaka Nanbara.

Bacteria Some sulfate-reducing bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide, which can cause sulfide stress cracking. Acidithiobacillus bacteria produce sulfuric acid; Acidothiobacillus thiooxidans frequently damages sewer pipes. Ferrobacillus ferrooxidans directly oxidizes iron to iron oxides and iron hydroxides; the rusticles forming on the RMS Titanic wreck are caused by bacterial activity. Other bacteria produce various acids, both organic and mineral, or ammonia. In presence of oxygen, aerobic bacteria like Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, Thiobacillus thioparus, and Thiobacillus concretivorus, all three widely present in the environment, are the common corrosion-causing factors resulting in biogenic sulfide corrosion. Without presence of oxygen, anaerobic bacteria, especially Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum, are common. Desulfovibrio salixigens requires at least 2.5% concentration of sodium chloride, but D. vulgaris and D. desulfuricans can grow in both fresh and salt water. D. africanus is another common corrosion- causing microorganism. The genus Desulfotomaculum comprises sulfate-reducing spore-forming bacteria; Dtm. orientis and Dtm. nigrificans are involved in corrosion processes. Sulfate-reducers require reducing environment; an electrode potential lower than -100 mV is required for them to thrive. However, even a small amount of produced hydrogen sulfide can achieve this shift, so the growth, once started, tends to accelerate. Layers of anaerobic bacteria can exist in the inner parts of the corrosion deposits, while the outer parts are inhabited by aerobic bacteria. Some bacteria are able to utilize hydrogen formed during cathodic corrosion processes. Bacterial colonies and deposits can form concentration cells, causing and enhancing galvanic corrosion. . Bacterial corrosion may appear in form of pitting corrosion, for example in pipelines of the oil and gas industry.Schwermer, C. U., G. Lavik, R. M. M. Abed, B. Dunsmore, T. G. Ferdelman, P. Stoodley, A. Gieseke, and D. de Beer. 2008. Impact of nitrate on the structure and function of bacterial biofilm communities in pipelines used for injection of seawater into oil fields. Applied and Environmental Microbiology 74:2841-2851. http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/74/9/2841 Anaerobic corrosion is evident as layers of metal sulfides and hydrogen sulfide smell. On cast iron, a graphitic corrosion selective leaching may be the result, with iron being consumed by the bacteria, leaving graphite matrix with low mechanical strength in place. Various corrosion inhibitors can be used to combat microbial corrosion. Formulae based on benzalkonium chloride are common in oilfield industry. Microbial corrosion can also apply to plastics, concrete, and many other materials. Two examples are Nylon-eating bacteria and Plastic-eating bacteria. Aviation fuel Hydrocarbon utilizing microorganisms, mostly Cladosporium resinae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Sulfate Reducing Bacteria, colloquially known as \\"HUM bugs\\", are commonly present in jet fuel. They live in the water-fuel interface of the water droplets, form dark black/brown/green, gel-like mats, and cause microbial corrosion to plastic and rubber parts of the aircraft fuel system by consuming them, and to the metal parts by the means of their acidic metabolic products. They are also incorrectly called algae due to their appearance. FSII, which is added to the fuel, acts as a growth retardant for them. There are about 250 kinds of bacteria that can live in jet fuel, but fewer than a dozen are meaningfully harmful. Nuclear waste Microorganisms can negatively affect radioactive elements confined in nuclear waste . Sewerage Sewer network structures are prone to biodeterioration of materials due to the action of some microorganisms associated to the sulfur cycle. It can be a severely damaging phenomenon which was firstly described by Olmstead and Hamlin in 1900Olmstead, W.M., Hamlin, H., 1900. Converting portions of the Los Angeles outfall sewer into a septic tank. Engineering News 44, 317-318. for a brick sewer located in Los Angeles. Jointed mortar between the bricks disintegrated and ironwork was heavily rusted. The mortar joint had ballooned to two to three times its original volume, leading to the destruction or the loosening of some bricks. Around 9% of damages described in sewer networks can be ascribed to the successive action of two kinds of microorganisms.Kaempfer and Berndt, 1999 Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) can grow in relatively thick layers of sedimentary sludge and sand (typically 1 mm thick) accumulating at the bottom of the pipes and characterized by anoxic conditions. They can grow using oxidized sulfur compounds present in the effluent as electron acceptor and excrete hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This gas is then emitted in the aerial part of the pipe and can impact the structure in two ways: either directly by reacting with the material and leading to a decrease in pH, or indirectly through its use as a nutrient by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), growing in oxic conditions, which produce biogenic sulfuric acid.Islander et al., 1991; Roberts et al., 2002; Okabe et al., 2007 The structure is then submitted to a biogenic sulfuric acid attack. Materials like calcium aluminate cements, PVC or vitrified clay pipe may be substituted for ordinary concrete or steel sewers that are not resistant in these environments.

It refers, mostly in neuroscience, to the emotional sensibility in response to affective stimuli of a particular valence. It is transmitted via the spinothalamic tract through the spinal cord, and can be associated with reflex actions such as the scratch, gag, and withdrawal reflexes. Sensory processing in the brain interacts with behavioral choices, such as decisions to eat or to stop eating, in both healthy individuals and those with eating disorders. Background and mechanism Affective sensory information is transmitted via the spinothalamic tract. The sensation information is then accompanied by a compulsion to act. For instance, the bottom-up approach would have an itch accompanied by the need to scratch, and a painful stimulus inducing the desire to withdraw from the pain. The location of the spinothalamic tract is important clinically due of the characteristic sensory deficits that follow certain spinal cord injuries. For instance, a unilateral spinal lesion will produce sensory loss of touch, pressure, vibration, and proprioception below the lesion on the same side. The pathways for pain and temperature, however, cross the spinal cord midline to ascend on the opposite side of the cord. Therefore, diminished sensation of pain below the lesion will be observed on the side opposite the mechanosensory loss and the lesion. Affect Affective sensation deals with response-emotionality and is distinct from presentative, or neutral, sensation. This is due to affective stimuli which can have positive, negative, or neutral valence. These stimuli can be sensed individually as well as in an integrated manner such that positive and negative affective stimuli can be combined to influence experiential affective sensation and response. In the case of combination, recency and contrast effects on overall affect are influential such that, for example, a negative stimuli followed by a positive stimuli yields an overall positive affect. =Emotional sensing= Subjective well-being draws from both cognitive and affective components, combining general evaluations of ones' life with overall affective sensitive-impressions. Neural measures of affective quality of life have been positively correlated with greater left alpha activity in the superior PFC, gray matter volume in multiple prefrontal cortices, spontaneous activity in the right amygdala, and even emotional intelligence. Those with affective disorders may also demonstrate differences in affective sensation as a result of mood-dependent alterations in brain arousal regulation, especially seen between those with mania, depression, and those without the disorder. Negative affectivity tends to be related to greater levels of social anxiety, anxious arousal, and anxiety sensitivity. Physical and mental modulation Physical pathological sensation, as occurs in IBS, COPD, and other illnesses, is also influential in affective sensation and response. The emotional response to especially a chronic illness can be correlated with its severity. This has been shown in COPD, where emotionally- driven descriptions of sensation due to breathing impairments may reflect the severity of the illness and probability of long-term, responsal behavior changes. Additionally, in IBS patients, affective sensation and its correlative brain areas including the ACC, insula, and VMPFC demonstrated heightened fMRI activity in response to painful visceral stimuli, and an inability to down-regulate their activation and modulate the emotional response to pain. This link between perceptual intensity and affective sensation persists in the case of chili pepper consumption. Those individuals who eat chili peppers more often, and presumably enjoy them, also report less burning sensation in response to eating chilis. While this could be due to either individual taste-perception differences or intensity judgement differences, it is more likely due to the latter because previous spicy food- consumption experiences do not correlate with the differences in affective sensation responses. =Taste sensation= Affective sensation can also be modulated using the top-down approach with cognitive factors influencing hedonic experience, such as with soup labeled \\"rich and delicious\\" inducing greater positive affect than when labeled \\"boiled vegetable water.\\" This modulation can be seen in the orbitofrontal cortex and pregenual cingulate cortex. Taste serves to identify potential nutrients and toxins. For example, when one tastes a potentially nutritious stimulus, the connectivity between the insula and a feeding network including the hypothalamus, ventral pallidum, and striatum is greater than when tasting a potentially harmful stimulus. These results support the existence of an integrated supramodal flavor system in the anterior ventral insula that preferentially communicates with the circuits guiding feeding when the flavor is potentially nutritive.

His work is collected by museums around the country including the Smithsonian American Art Museum.  Biography  Gronk was born in Los Angeles to Mexican-American parents and was raised mainly by his mother. He remembers that he was always making things and he felt that was what he was best at. He also remembers being influenced by popular culture on television. Another artistic influence on Gronk was his uncle who was always drawing and Gronk wanted to be able to draw like him. Another influence on Gronk was foreign film which he generally watched in Santa Monica. He was fascinated with the larger world and concepts that many of these films from Russia, France and elsewhere brought to his imagination. At age fourteen, Gronk started writing his own plays. One of his earliest performance plays was Cockroaches Have No Friends, which led to him meeting Patssi Valdez, Harry Gamboa, Jr, Willie Herron and Sylvia Delgado, with the first three of them becoming members of Asco later on. Gronk also worked with Mundo Meza and Cyclona on various performance pieces, especially those that pertained to gender issues. Gronk took his education beyond what he learned in school. He was a big reader from a young age and liked to learn everything he could about a subject he was interested in. He did much of his research at the library, gaining a vast knowledge of European modern art and film. Gronk recalls that in high school that he did not fit into \\"the confines of compulsory heterosexuality.\\" He states that he sat at the 'queer table' at lunch but because he was an excellent artist, students at the school didn't consider him to be gay. Bored with high school and stimulated into political action by the anti-Vietnam War and the Chicano Blowouts at East Los Angeles schools, Gronk and friends barely attended their final years in school, and may not have graduated. He took some classes at East L.A. College. When Gronk performed Cockroaches Have No Friends at East L.A. College, it was a disaster, but afterwards, Gamboa contacted Gronk and invited him to work on a magazine project called Regeneracion with Valdez and Herron. Working on the magazine, they drew together in garages owned by Valdez' and Herron's mothers. This work on the magazine led to the creation of Asco. During the Vietnam War, Gronk was drafted and went to boot camp at Fort Ord for a period of around two weeks. He was unable to conform, according to the army, and he was sent back home. Career and Art Gronk was a founding member of Asco, a multi-media arts collective based in Los Angeles which was active in the 1970s and 1980s. Influenced by European film, existentialism, and literature—especially the work of Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Samuel Beckett. Gronk as a member of ASCO made \\"movies without film\\" and farcical \\"happenings\\" or street performances. In 1977, Gronk was one of the founders of Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE). Gronk's involvement with LACE often involved his creation and execution of murals, many of which were considered controversial. Indeed, other artists criticized ASCO and Gronk for being too nontraditional. Gronk often clashed with founder of East LA's Self Help Graphics, Sister Karen Boccalero, who he called \\"the smoking nun.\\" Gronk has not always sought to bring his art to just those who regularly visit galleries: he has circulated fliers about his work at \\"bus stops, seeking workers, students and the people of the streets.\\" Gronk uses his \\"lowbrow\\" style to confront the viewer and ask them to rethink \\"visual paradigms,\\" using humor and irony to make his statements. One of his most visible challenges to the status quo took place as a member of ASCO when he, and co-members Harry Gamboa and Willie Herron, tagged their names on the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) after being told that LACMA didn't collect Chicano art because it wasn't \\"fine art.\\" After 1984, Gronk began a series of paintings that included one of his recurring figures, La Tormenta who functions like a guide through his art. This body of work was considered more \\"acceptable\\" to the mainstream world of art. He is best known for his murals, including those at Estrada Courts in East Los Angeles. More recently his murals have been intentionally painted as temporary art works (i.e., Fisher Gallery, University of Southern California) to be whitewashed later. Gronk's murals, paintings on canvas, and widely collected screen prints, relate to the direct visual aesthetic contained in works by German Expressionist Max Beckmann and the cartoon-like paintings of American Phillip Guston, along with vernacular arts of early civilizations (i.e., Toltec figurines). Gronk has collaborated with Tandem Press. His work is represented by Daniel Saxon of Saxon Gallery, West Hollywood, California. Gronk is accessible to students and others, often seen walking in Downtown Los Angeles. Comfortable with the moniker \\"Chicano artist\\", Gronk's intense devotion to craft and multi-disciplinary pursuits are informed by a wide knowledge from a myriad of global and historic sources.

In Victoria, the chain traded as Caltex Safeway until Woolworths scrapped the name in late 2008 and traded as Caltex Woolworths or Woolworths Petrol until its sale in 2019. In April 2019, Woolworths sold its 540 service stations to the British company EG Group for $1.72 billion. Since the sale, Woolworths-branded service stations have been progressively rebranded into EG stations. History Woolworths' foray into the petrol business began in 1996 with a Woolworths Plus Petrol station in Dubbo, New South Wales. Caltex/Woolworths Petrol Station Signage in April 2020 In 2003, Woolworths announced a joint venture with Caltex. Caltex would supply fuel to the outlets and they would be co-branded. All Woolworths Petrol and selected Caltex sites near Woolworths supermarkets were rebranded accordingly. In late 2014, Woolworths and Caltex revised the terms of their alliance, with the changes affecting the 131 Caltex-operated sites. 92 of the sites would be rebranded as either Star Mart or Star Shop convenience stores while continuing to accept the Woolworths fuel discount redemption while the remainder would exit the Caltex–Woolworths alliance entirely. Another 12 sites were added to the Caltex redemption network in 2015 for a total of 105 Caltex operated sites accepting the Woolworths fuel discount. In August 2016, Woolworths Rewards' members could collect points for every dollar spent in any Caltex Woolworths outlet for the first time, in addition to the already-existing fuel discount offer. In December 2016, Woolworths announced it would sell its own operated sites to BP for AU$1.75 billion, and would enter into a franchise agreement to retain its branded stores at the sites. The ACCC blocked the deal in August 2017 over concerns it would reduce competition and result in motorists paying more for petrol. BP pulled out of the deal in July 2018, saying the concessions that would have been required to satisfy the ACCC would make the deal commercially unviable. On 7 November 2018, it was announced that 125 Caltex sites had begun accepting the Woolworths fuel discount redemption, and 680 Caltex sites had also begun to allow Woolworths Rewards' members to earn points, joining the existing network of 538 Caltex Woolworths sites and 105 Caltex operated sites. Two days later, on 9 November 2018, Woolworths announced it would sell its 540 stores to the British company EG Group for $1.72 billion. Woolworths said it would enter a 15-year agreement with EG that would maintain its fuel discount redemption across the network, and enable Woolworths Rewards points to be earned on fuel transactions across its network. Woolworths would also sell wholesale food and groceries to the chain of service stations under the agreement. The acquisition was completed on 1 April 2019. Fuel discount offer Original Design of Caltex Woolworths station in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales As part of the agreement between EG and Woolworths, EG Australia and Caltex Woolworths service stations continue to offer a 4¢ per litre discount off the pump price for customers who present a fuel voucher in the form of a docket or in their Woolworths Rewards loyalty card, obtained after spending a qualifying amount of $30 or more at Woolworths supermarkets and Tasmanian Big W department stores. Before September 2010, fuel dockets also could be obtained after spending at Big W nationwide. The 4¢ per litre discount can be doubled to 8¢ if the fuel customer also spends at least $5 of goods at the service station's store, and pays for both fuel and goods in the same transaction. When the offer was first introduced in the 1990s, it initially involved an escalating scale of discount off the price of petrol, depending on the amount spent to qualify – $30.00-$59.99 for 2¢ per litre, $60.00-$149.99 for 4¢ per litre, and $150.00 and above for 6¢ per litre. However, the offer eventually settled on a median 4¢ per litre discount with purchases of $30.00 and over, after the launch of rival Coles' equivalent fuel discount offer through Coles Express service stations in 2003.

The 2-imidazolines are the most common imidazolines commercially, as the ring exists in some natural products and some pharmaceuticals. They also have been examined in the context of organic synthesis, coordination chemistry, and homogeneous catalysis. Synthesis A variety of routes exist for the synthesis of imidazolines, with the most common methods involving the condensation of 1,2-diamines (e.g. ethylenediamine) with nitriles or esters. The nitrile based route is essentially a cyclic Pinner reaction; it requires high temperatures and acid catalysis and is effective for both alkyl and aryl nitriles. Synthesis of imidazolines from nitrile and from ester precursors. Biological role Many imidazolines are biologically active. Most bio-active derivatives bear a substituent (aryl or alkyl group) on the carbon between the nitrogen centers.

The best-known examples and by far largest subgroup are the N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) (sometimes called Arduengo carbenes), for example diaminocarbenes with the general formula (R2N)2C:, where the 'R's are typically alkyl and aryl groups. The groups can be linked to give heterocyclic carbenes, such as those derived from imidazole, imidazoline, thiazole or triazole. Traditionally carbenes are viewed as so reactive that were only studied indirectly, e.g. by trapping reactions. This situation has changed dramatically with the emergence of persistent carbenes. Although they are fairly reactive substances, i.e., undergoing dimerization, many can be isolated as pure substances. Persistent carbenes can exist in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable. The relative stability of these compounds is only partly due to steric hindrance by bulky groups. Some singlet carbenes are thermodynamically stable in the absence of moisture and (in most cases) oxygen, and can be isolated and indefinitely stored. Others dimerise slowly over days. Triplet state carbenes have half-lives measured in seconds, and therefore can be observed but not stored. History =Early evidence= In 1957, Ronald Breslow proposed that a relatively stable nucleophilic carbene, a thiazol-2-ylidene derivative, was involved in the catalytic cycle of vitamin B1 (thiamine) that yields furoin from furfural. In this cycle, the vitamin's thiazolium ring exchanges a hydrogen atom (attached to carbon 2 of the ring) for a furfural residue. In deuterated water, the C2-proton was found to rapidly exchange for a deuteron in a statistical equilibrium. Deuterium exchange of the C2-proton of thiazolium salt This exchange was proposed to proceed via intermediacy of a thiazol-2-ylidene. In 2012 the isolation of the so-called Breslow intermediate was reported.Chemists Approach Elusive Breslow Intermediate Carmen Drahl In 1960, Hans-Werner Wanzlick and co-workers conjectured that carbenes derived from dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene were produced by vacuum pyrolysis of the corresponding 2-trichloromethyl dihydroimidazole compounds with the loss of chloroform. They conjectured that the carbene existed in equilibrium with its dimer, a tetraaminoethylene derivative, the so-called Wanzlick equilibrium. This conjecture was challenged by Lemal and co-workers in 1964, who presented evidence that the dimer did not dissociate; and by Winberg in 1965. However, subsequent experiments by Denk, Herrmann and others have confirmed this equilibrium, albeit in specific circumstances. =Isolation of persistent carbenes= In 1970, Wanzlick's group generated imidazol-2-ylidene carbenes by the deprotonation of an imidazolium salt. Wanzlick as well as Roald Hoffmann], proposed that these imidazole-based carbenes should be more stable than their 4,5-dihydro analogues, due to Hückel-type aromaticity. Wanzlick did not however isolate imidazol-2-ylidenes, but instead their coordination compounds with mercury and isothiocyanate: Preparation and trapping of an imidazol-2-ylidene In 1988, Guy Bertrand and others isolated a phosphinocarbene. These species can be represented as either a λ3-phosphinocarbene or λ5-phosphaacetylene: Alkyne and carbene resonances structures of Bertrand’s carbene These compounds were called \\"push-pull carbenes\\" in reference to the contrasting electron affinities of the phosphorus and silicon atoms.They exhibit both carbenic and alkynic reactivity. An X-ray structure of this molecule has not been obtained and at the time of publication some doubt remained as to their exact carbenic nature. In 1991, a stable, isolated, and crystalline diaminocarbene, which can be represented as a carbene or a nitrogen carbon ylide, was obtained by Arduengo and co-workers, by deprotonation of an imidazolium chloride with a strong base: Preparation of N,N'-diadamantyl-imidazol-2-ylidene This carbene, the forerunner of a large family of carbenes with the imidazol-2-ylidene core, was found to be indefinitely stable at room temperature (in the absence of oxygen and moisture), and melted at 240–241 °C without decomposition. Another interesting chemical property of this ylidic compound was a characteristic resonance in the 13C NMR spectrum at 211 ppm for the carbenic atom. The X-ray structure revealed longer N–C bond lengths in the ring of the carbene than in the parent imidazolium compound, indicating that there was very little double bond character to these bonds. The first air-stable ylidic carbene, a chlorinated member of the imidazol-2-ylidene family, was obtained in 1997. In 2000, Bertrand obtained additional carbenes of the phosphanyl type, including (phosphanyl)(trifluoromethyl)carbene, stable in solution at -30 °C and a moderately stable (amino)(aryl)carbene with only one heteroatom adjacent to the carbenic atom. =Factors affecting stability of heteroatom-stabilized carbenes= Dimethyl imidazol-2-ylidene, a stable dicarbene with little steric hindrance (external viewer) The stability of Arduengo carbenes was initially attributed to the bulky N-adamantyl substituents, which prevents the carbene from dimerising due to steric hindrance. Replacement of the N-adamantyl groups with methyl groups also affords stable NHCs. Thus, imidazole-2-ylidenes are thermodynamically stable. It had been also conjectured that the double bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone, which gave aromatic character to that system, was important for the carbene's stability. This conjecture was disproved in 1995 by Arduengo's group, who obtained a derivative of dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene, lacking the double bond. The thermodynamical stability in this compound, and the role of steric protection in preventing dimerization, has been a topic of some dispute. Bis(diisopropylamino) carbene, the first acyclic stable carbene The first acyclic persistent carbene was reported in 1996, thus showing that a cyclic backbone was not necessary for their stability. Unlike the cyclic derivatives, the acyclic carbenes are flexible with respect to rotation of the bonds to the carbenic atom. By measuring the barrier to rotation of these bonds, the extent of their double bond character could be measured, and the ylidic nature of this carbene could be determined. Like the cyclic diaminocarbenes, unhindered variants tend to dimerize. Most persistent carbenes are stabilized by two flanking nitrogen centers. The aminothiocarbene and an aminooxycarbene are outliers. and an . In these stable compounds, the carbenic atom lies between a nitrogen atom and either a sulfur or oxygen atom: Stable carbenes with oxygen or sulfur atoms bound to the carbenic atom (External viewer) Unlike NHCs, these carbenes are not thermodynamically stable but tend to dimerize. In bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene, which is stable at room temperature, the carbene atom is connected to two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated that the presence of heteroatoms next to the carbene is not necessary for stability, either. Classes of stable carbenes The following are examples of the classes of stable carbenes isolated to date: =Imidazol-2-ylidenes= The first stable carbenes to be isolated were based on an imidazole ring, with the hydrogen in carbon 2 of the ring (between the two nitrogen atoms) removed, and other hydrogens replaced by various groups. These imidazol-2-ylidenes are still the most stable and the most well studied and understood family of persistent carbenes. A considerable range of imidazol-2-ylidenes have been synthesised, including those in which the 1,3-positions have been functionalised with alkyl, aryl, alkyloxy, alkylamino, alkylphosphino and even chiral substituents: Stable imidazol-2-ylidenes 1,3-Dimesityl-4,5-dichloroimidazol-2-ylidene, the first air-stable carbene (external viewer) In particular, substitution of two chlorine atoms for the two hydrogens at ring positions 4 and 5 yielded the first air-stable carbene. Its extra stability probably results from the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine substituents, which reduce the electron density on the carbon atom bearing the lone pair, via induction through the sigma-backbone. Molecules containing two and even three imidazol-2-ylidene groups have also been synthesised. Imidazole-based carbenes are thermodynamically stable and generally have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 210–230 ppm for the carbenic carbon. Typically, X-ray structures of these molecules show N-C-N bond angles of 101–102°. =Triazol-5-ylidenes= Another family of persistent carbenes are based on the 1,2,4-triazole ring, with the unfilled orbitals in carbon 5 of this ring. The triazol-5-ylidenes pictured below were first prepared by Enders and co-workers by vacuum pyrolysis through loss of methanol from 2-methoxytriazoles. Only a limited range of these molecules have been reported, with the triphenyl substituted molecule being commercially available. Triazol-5-ylidenes Triazole-based carbenes are thermodynamically stable and have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 210–220 ppm for the carbenic carbon. The X-ray structure of the triphenyl substituted carbene above shows an N-C-N bond angle of ca. 101°. The 5-methoxytriazole precursor to this carbene was made by the treatment of a triazolium salt with sodium methoxide, which attacks as a nucleophile. This may indicate that these carbenes are less aromatic than imidazol-2-ylidenes, as the imidazolium precursors do not react with nucleophiles due to the resultant loss of aromaticity. =Other diaminocarbenes= The two families above can be seen as special cases of a broader class of compounds which have a carbenic atom bridging two nitrogen atoms. A range of such diaminocarbenes have been prepared principally by Roger Alder's research group. In some of these compounds, the N-C-N unit is a member of a 5 or 6 membered non-aromatic ring, including a bicyclic example. In other examples, the adjacent nitrogens are connected only through the carbenic atom, and may or may not be part of separate rings. Synthesised cyclic and acyclic diaminocarbenes Unlike the aromatic imidazol-2-ylidenes or triazol-5-ylidenes, these carbenes appear not to be thermodynamically stable, as shown by the dimerisation of some unhindered cyclic and acyclic examples. Studies suggest that these carbenes dimerise via acid catalysed dimerisation (as in the Wanzlick equilibrium). Diaminocarbenes have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 230–270 ppm for the carbenic atom. The X-ray structure of dihydroimidazole-2-ylidene shows a N-C-N bond angle of ca. 106°, whilst the angle of the acyclic carbene is 121°, both greater than those seen for imidazol-2-ylidenes. =Heteroamino carbenes= There exist several variants of the stable carbenes above where one of the nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carbene center (the α nitrogens) has been replaced by an alternative heteroatom, such as oxygen, sulfur, or phosphorus. Synthesised heteroamino carbenes (top and bottom right) and Bertrand's carbenes (bottom left) In particular, the formal substitution of sulfur for one of the nitrogens in imidazole would yield the aromatic heterocyclic compound thiazole. A thiazole based carbene (analogous to the carbene postulated by Breslow) has been prepared and characterised by X-ray crystallography. Other non-aromatic aminocarbenes with O, S and P atoms adjacent (i.e. alpha) to the carbene centre have been prepared, e.g. thio- and oxyiminium based carbenes have been characterised by X-ray crystallography. Since oxygen and sulfur are divalent, steric protection of the carbenic centre is limited especially when the N-C-X unit is part of a ring. These acyclic carbenes have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 250–300 ppm for the carbenic carbon, further downfield than any other types of stable carbene. X-ray structures have shown N-C-X bond angles of ca. 104 ° and 109 ° respectively. Carbenes that formally derive from imidazole-2-ylidenes by substitution of sulfur, oxygen, or other chalcogens for both α-nitrogens are expected to be unstable, as they have the potential to dissociate into an alkyne (R1C≡CR2) and a carbon dichalcogenide (X1=C=X2). =Non-amino carbenes= The reaction of carbon disulfide (CS2) with electron deficient acetylene derivatives is proposed to give transient 1,3-dithiolium carbenes (i.e. where X1 = X2 = S), which then dimerise to give derivatives of tetrathiafulvene. Thus it is possible that the reverse of this process might be occurring in similar carbenes. =Bertrand's carbenes= In Bertrand's persistent carbenes, the unsaturated carbon is bonded to a phosphorus and a silicon. However, these compounds seem to exhibit some alkynic properties, and when published the exact carbenic nature of these red oils was in debate. =Other nucleophilic carbenes= One stable N-heterocyclic carbene has a structure analogous to borazine with one boron atom replaced by a methylene group. This results in a planar 6-electron compound. LiTMP; two cyclohexyl groups shield the carbene. =Cyclopropenylidenes= Another family of carbenes is based on a cyclopropenylidene core, a three-carbon ring with a double bond between the two atoms adjacent to the carbenic one. This family is exemplified by bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene. =Triplet state carbenes= In 2001, Hideo Tomioka and his associates were able to produce a comparatively stable triplet carbene (bis(9-anthryl)carbene, with a half-life of 19 minutes), by taking advantage of electron delocalization. Delocalization in a stable triplet carbene reported by Tomioka (2001) In 2006 a triplet carbene was reported by the same group with a half-life of 40 minutes. This carbene is prepared by a photochemical decomposition of a diazomethane precursor by 300 nanometer light in benzene with expulsion of nitrogen gas. A persistent triplet carbene (right), synthesized by Itoh (2006) Exposure to oxygen (a triplet diradical) converts this carbene to the corresponding benzophenone. The diphenylmethane compound is formed when it is trapped by cyclohexa-1,4-diene. As with the other carbenes, this species contains large bulky substituents, namely bromine and the trifluoromethyl groups on the phenyl rings, that shield the carbene and prevent or slow down the process of dimerization to a 1,1,2,2-tetra(phenyl)alkene. Based on computer simulations, the distance of the divalent carbon atom to its neighbors is claimed to be 138 picometers with a bond angle of 158.8°. The planes of the phenyl groups are almost at right angles to each other (the dihedral angle being 85.7°).  Mesoionic carbenes  Mesoionic carbenes (MICs) are similar to N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) except that canonical resonance structures with the carbene depicted cannot be drawn without adding additional charges. Mesoionic carbenes are also referred to as abnormal N-heterocyclic carbenes (aNHC) or remote N-heterocyclic carbenes (rNHC). A variety of free carbenes can be isolated and are stable at room temperature. Other free carbenes are not stable and are susceptible to intermolecular decomposition pathways. Chemical properties =Basicity and nucleophilicity= The imidazol-2-ylidenes are strong bases, having a pKa of ca. 24 for the conjugate acid in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): Measurement of the pKa value for the conjugate acid of an imidazol-2-ylidene However, further work showed that diaminocarbenes will deprotonate the DMSO solvent, with the resulting anion reacting with the resulting amidinium salt. Using D6-DMSO as an NMR solvent can have unexpected results. Reaction of imidazol-2-ylidenes with 1-bromohexane gave 90% of the 2-substituted adduct, with only 10% of the corresponding alkene, indicating that these molecules are also reasonably nucleophilic. pKa values for the conjugate acids of several NHC families have been examined in aqueous solution. pKa values of triazolium ions lie in the range 16.5 - 17.8, around 3 pKa units more acidic than related imidazolium ions. =Dimerisation= At one time, stable carbenes were thought to reversibly dimerise through the so-called Wanzlick equilibrium. However, imidazol-2-ylidenes and triazol-5-ylidenes are thermodynamically stable and do not dimerise, and have been stored in solution in the absence of water and air for years. This is presumably due to the aromatic nature of these carbenes, which is lost upon dimerisation. In fact imidazol-2-ylidenes are so thermodynamically stable that only in highly constrained conditions are these carbenes forced to dimerise. Chen and Taton made a doubly tethered diimidazol-2-ylidene by deprotonating the respective diimidazolium salt. Only the deprotonation of the doubly tethered diimidazolium salt with the shorter methylene bridge (-CH2-) resulted in the dicarbene dimer: Dimerisation of tethered diimidazol-2-ylidenes If this dimer existed as a dicarbene, the electron lone pairs on the carbenic carbon would be forced into close proximity. Presumably the resulting repulsive electrostatic interactions would have a significant destabilising effect. To avoid this electronic interaction, the carbene units dimerise. On the other hand, heteroamino carbenes (e.g. R2N-C:-OR or R2N-C:-SR) and non-aromatic carbenes such as diaminocarbenes (e.g. R2N-C:-NR2) have been shown to dimerise, albeit quite slowly. This has been presumed to be due to the high barrier to singlet state dimerisation: \\"Least motion\\" (path A - not allowed) and \\"non-least motion\\" (path B) routes of carbene dimerisation Diaminocarbenes do not truly dimerise, but rather form the dimer by reaction via formamidinium salts, a protonated precursor species. Accordingly, this reaction can be acid catalysed. This reaction occurs because unlike imidazolium based carbenes, there is no loss of aromaticity in protonation of the carbene. Unlike the dimerisation of triplet state carbenes, these singlet state carbenes do not approach head to head (\\"least motion\\"), but rather the carbene lone pair attacks the empty carbon p-orbital (\\"non- least motion\\"). Carbene dimerisation can be catalyzed by both acids and metals. =Reactivity= The chemistry of stable carbenes has not been fully explored. However, Enders et al. D. Enders, K. Breuer, J. Runsink, and J. H. Teles (1996), Liebigs Ann. Chem., page 2019D. Enders, K. Breuer, J. H. Teles, and K. Ebel (1997), Journal Fur Praktische Chemie-Chemiker-Zeitung volume 339, page 397 have performed a range of organic reactions involving a triazol-5-ylidene. These reactions are outlined below and may be considered as a model for other carbenes. centerthumb600px {class=wikitable +Reactions of triazol-5-ylidene !a 3,6-diphenyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine, toluene 92% style=\\"border-top: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\\" !e 2 equiv., PhNCO, toluene, reflux 92% - !b RXH, RT 95–97% style=\\"border-top: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\\" !f CS2, toluene, or PhNCS, THF, RT 71–90% - !c O2, S8, or Se, toluene, reflux 54–68% style=\\"border-top: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\\" !g Maleimide, THF, RT 47–84% - !d R1CH=CHR2, THF, RT 25–68% style=\\"border- top: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\\" !h Dimethylacetylene dicarboxylate, THF, reflux 21% } These carbenes tend to behave in a nucleophilic fashion (e and f), performing insertion reactions (b), addition reactions (c), [2+1] cycloadditions (d, g and h), [4+1] cycloadditions (a) as well as simple deprotonations. The insertion reactions (b) probably proceed via deprotonation, resulting in the generation of a nucleophile (−XR) which can attack the generated salt giving the impression of a H-X insertion. The reported stable isothiazole carbene (2) derived from an isothiazolium perchlorate (1) was questioned, who were only able to isolate 2-imino-2H-thiete (4). The intermediate 3 was proposed through a rearrangement reaction. This carbene is no longer considered stable. Isothiazole carbene DeHope 2007 =Carbene complexation= Imidazol-2-ylidenes, triazol-5-ylidenes (and less so, diaminocarbenes) have been shown to co-ordinate to a plethora of elements, from alkali metals, main group elements, transition metals and even lanthanides and actinides. A periodic table of elements gives some idea of the complexes which have been prepared, and in many cases these have been identified by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Stable carbenes are believed to behave in a similar fashion to organophosphines in their co- ordination properties to metals. These ligands are said to be good σ-donors through the carbenic lone pair, but poor π-acceptors due to internal ligand back-donation from the nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carbene centre, and so are able to co-ordinate to even relatively electron deficient metals. Enders and Hermann have shown that these carbenes are suitable replacements for phosphine ligands in several catalytic cycles. Whilst they have found that these ligands do not activate the metal catalyst as much as phosphine ligands they often result in more robust catalysts. Several catalytic systems have been looked into by Hermann and Enders, using catalysts containing imidazole and triazole carbene ligands, with moderate success. Grubbs has reported replacing a phosphine ligand (PCy3) with an imidazol-2-ylidene in the olefin metathesis catalyst RuCl2(PCy3)2CHPh, and noted increased ring closing metathesis as well as exhibiting \\"a remarkable air and water stability\\". Molecules containing two and three carbene moieties have been prepared as potential bidentate and tridentate carbene ligands. =Carbenes in organometallic chemistry & catalysis= Carbenes can be stabilised as organometallic species. These transition metal carbene complexes fall into two categories: *Fischer carbenes in which carbenes are tethered to a metal and an electron-withdrawing group (usually a carbonyl), *Schrock carbenes; in which carbenes are tethered to a metal and an electron-donating group. The reactions that such carbenes participate in are very different from those in which organic carbenes participate. =Triplet state carbene chemistry= Persistent triplet state carbenes are likely to have very similar reactivity as other non-persistent triplet state carbenes. Physical properties Carbene peak in 13C NMR Those carbenes that have been isolated to date tend to be colorless solids with low melting points. These carbenes tend to sublime at low temperatures under high vacuum. One of the more useful physical properties is the diagnostic chemical shift of the carbenic carbon atom in the 13C-NMR spectrum. Typically this peak is in the range between 200 and 300 ppm, where few other peaks appear in the 13C-NMR spectrum. An example is shown on the left for a cyclic diaminocarbene which has a carbenic peak at 238 ppm. Upon coordination to metal centers, the 13C carbene resonance usually shifts highfield, depending on the Lewis acidity of the complex fragment. Based on this observation, Huynh et al. developed a new methodology to determine ligand donor strengths by 13C NMR analysis of trans-palladium(II)-carbene complexes. The use of a 13C-labeled N-heterocyclic carbene ligand also allows for the study of mixed carbene-phosphine complexes, which undergo trans-cis- isomerization due to the trans effect. Applications A second generation Grubbs' catalyst. NHCs are widely used as ancillary ligand in organometallic chemistry. One practical application is the ruthenium-based Grubbs' catalyst and NHC-Palladium Complexes for cross-coupling reactions.S. P. Nolan [editor] (2006). N-Heterocyclic carbenes in synthesis, Wiley-VCH F. Glorius [editor] (2007) N-Heterocyclic carbenes in transition metal catalysis, Springer NHC- metal complexes, specifically Ag(I)-NHC complexes have been widely tested for their biological applications. Preparation methods NHCs are often strongly basic (the pKa value of the conjugate acid of an imidazol-2-ylidene was measured at ca. 24) and react with oxygen. Clearly these reactions are performed using air-free techniques, avoiding compounds of even moderate acidity. Although imidazolium salts are stable to nucleophilic addition, other non-aromatic salts are not (i.e. formamidinium salts). In these cases, strong unhindered nucleophiles are avoided whether they are generated in situ or are present as an impurity in other reagents (e.g., LiOH in BuLi). Several approaches have been developed in order to prepare stable carbenes, these are outlined below. =Deprotonation= Deprotonation of carbene precursor salts with strong bases has proved a reliable route to almost all stable carbenes: Deprotonation of precursor salts to give stable carbenes. Imidazol-2-ylidenes and dihydroimidazol-2-ylidenes, e.g. IMes, have been prepared by the deprotonation of the respective imidazolium and dihydroimidazolium salts. The acyclic carbenes and the tetrahydropyrimidinyl based carbenes were prepared by deprotonation using strong homogeneous bases. Several bases and reaction conditions have been employed with varying success. The degree of success has been principally dependent on the nature of the precursor being deprotonated. The major drawback with this method of preparation is the problem of isolation of the free carbene from the metals ions used in their preparation. Metal hydride bases One might believe that sodium or potassium hydride would be the ideal base for deprotonating these precursor salts. The hydride should react irreversibly with the loss of hydrogen to give the desired carbene, with the inorganic by-products and excess hydride being removed by filtration. In practice this reaction is often too slow, requiring the addition of DMSO or t-BuOH. These reagents generate soluble catalysts, which increase the rate of reaction of this heterogeneous system, via the generation of tert-butoxide or dimsyl anion. However, these catalysts have proved ineffective for the preparation of non-imidazolium adducts as they tend to act as nucleophiles towards the precursor salts and in so doing are destroyed. The presence of hydroxide ions as an impurity in the metal hydride could also destroy non- aromatic salts. Deprotonation with sodium or potassium hydride in a mixture of liquid ammonia/THF at –40 °C has been reported for imidazole-based carbenes. Arduengo and co-workers managed to prepare a dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene using NaH. However, this method has not been applied to the preparation of diaminocarbenes. In some cases, potassium tert-butoxide can be employed without the addition of a metal hydride. Alkyllithiums The use of alkyllithiums as strong bases has not been extensively studied, and have been unreliable for deprotonation of precursor salts. With non-aromatic salts, n-BuLi and PhLi can act as nucleophiles whilst t-BuLi can on occasion act as a source of hydride, reducing the salt with the generation of isobutene: Reduction of formamidinium salts with tert-butyllithium Amides bases  Lithium amides like the diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) generally work well for the deprotonation of all types of salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct. =Metal-free carbene preparation= Stable carbenes readily coordinate to metals; in this case a diaminocarbene coordinates to KHMDS to form a complex. The preparation of stable carbenes free from metal cations has been keenly sought to allow further study of the carbene species in isolation from these metals. Separating a carbene from a carbene-metal complex can be problematic due to the stability of the complex. Accordingly, it is preferable to make the carbene free from these metals in the first place. Indeed, some metal ions, rather than stabilising the carbene, have been implicated in the catalytic dimerisation of unhindered examples. Shown right is an X-ray structure showing a complex between a diaminocarbene and potassium HMDS. This complex was formed when excess KHMDS was used as a strong base to deprotonate the formamidinium salt. Removing lithium ions resulting from deprotonation with reagents such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) can be especially problematic. Potassium and sodium salt by-products tend to precipitate from solution and can be removed. Lithium ions may be chemically removed by binding to species such as cryptands or crown ethers. Metal free carbenes have been prepared in several ways as outlined below: Dechalcogenation Another approach of preparing carbenes has relied on the desulfurisation of thioureas with potassium in THF. A contributing factor to the success of this reaction is that the byproduct, potassium sulfide, is insoluble in the solvent. The elevated temperatures suggest that this method is not suitable for the preparation of unstable dimerising carbenes. A single example of the deoxygenation of a urea with a fluorene derived carbene to give the tetramethyldiaminocarbene and fluorenone has also been reported: Preparation of carbenes by dechalcogenation The desulfurisation of thioureas with molten potassium to give imidazol-2-ylidenes or diaminocarbenes has not been widely used. The method was used to prepare dihydroimidazole carbenes. Vacuum pyrolysis Vacuum pyrolysis, with the removal of neutral volatile by-products (CH3OH, CHCl3), has been used to prepare dihydroimidazole and triazole based carbenes: Preparation of carbenes via vacuum pyrolysis Historically the removal of chloroform by vacuum pyrolysis of d adducts was used by Wanzlick in his early attempts to prepare dihydroimidazol-2-ylidenes but this method is not widely used. The Enders laboratory has used vacuum pyrolysis of a c adduct to generate a triazolium-5-ylidene c. Bis(trimethylsilyl)mercury Bis(trimethylsilyl)mercury (CH3)3Si-Hg-Si(CH3)3 reacts with chloro-iminium and chloro-amidinium salts to give a metal-free carbene and elemental mercury. For example, (CH3)3Si-Hg-Si(CH3)3 \\\\+ R2N=C(Cl)-NR2\\\\+ Cl− → R2N-C:-NR2 \\\\+ Hg(l) \\\\+ (CH3)3Si-Cl Photochemical decomposition Persistent triplet state carbenes have been prepared by photochemical decomposition of a diazomethane product via the expulsion of nitrogen gas, at a wavelength of 300 nm in benzene. =Purification= Sublimation of a carbene Stable carbenes are very reactive, and so the minimum amount of handling is desirable using air-free techniques. However, provided rigorously dry, relatively non-acidic and air- free materials are used, stable carbenes are reasonably robust to handling per se. By way of example, a stable carbene prepared from potassium hydride can be filtered through a dry celite pad to remove excess KH (and resulting salts) from the reaction. On a relatively small scale, a suspension containing a stable carbene in solution can be allowed to settle and the supernatant solution pushed through a dried membrane syringe filter. Stable carbenes are readily soluble in non-polar solvents such as hexane, and so typically recrystallisation of stable carbenes can be difficult, due to the unavailability of suitable non-acidic polar solvents. Air-free sublimation as shown right can be an effective method of purification, although temperatures below 60 °C under high vacuum are preferable as these carbenes are relatively volatile and also could begin to decompose at these higher temperatures. Indeed, sublimation in some cases can give single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis. However, strong complexation to metal ions like lithium will in most cases prevent sublimation.

Synopsis Valérian and Laureline's astroship has crashed in the middle of a graveyard of spaceships on an unknown asteroid. Swept over a waterfall, they are rescued by a motley group of various aliens gathering seaweed. Suddenly, overhead, a flock of birds gathers over the ship. The crew fly into a panic upon sight of these \\"Birds-Of-Madness\\" and Valérian and Laureline are ordered to work with the others in gathering the seaweed. One of the crew is a human but he refuses to talk to Valérian. The hold fully loaded, the boat begins the journey back to its port. On the way, they get into a conversation with a young alien called Sül who tells them that all the others are mad – they think only of gathering as much food as possible for their Master. Arriving at the village, they join a flotilla of boats that travels across the viscous marshes and along a series of fjords until they reach a cove – from here they must continue on foot. Laden with the produce, they reach the Village of the Fruits where they join a caravan carrying exotic fruits. When Valérian asks Sül who the Master is, Sül laughs – nobody has ever seen him but he calls all those he wants into his service. Some are brought here, others are born here. Many have been here so long they have no memory of their past lives. The caravan continues across a vast distance, joined by more and more caravans all bringing their produce to the Master and watched by the birds-of-madness, until they reach his city at the head of an immense valley. The bottom of the valley, the domain of the Master, lies shrouded in mist. They are brought to the great kitchens where they are put to work preparing klaar to feed the master. When the klaar is ready, they are brought to a huge, beautifully decorated basin. The klaar is poured into the basin where it will flow to the Master. The others will be allowed to dine on the leftovers. Suddenly, a man, starving, detaches himself from the crowd and tries to take some of the klaar for himself. The birds-of- madness attack biting him. Sül tries to intervene but is bitten himself. The man now thinks he is a bird while Sül's hatred for the Master now manifests itself as fully fledged rage. Having sated themselves on the remnants of the klaar, the rest of the crowd turn on Sül and the man and, despite Valérian and Laureline's attempts to stop them, carry the two of them away. Valérian and Laureline follow but are too late and Sül and the man are thrown into a pit where all those driven insane by the birds are cast. Valérian tries to talk to the crowd, to make them see what they are doing is wrong but to no avail – the crowd hurl stones at them and Laureline is knocked unconscious. Valérian drags her away to safety. That night, Valérian and Laureline return to the pit once the crowds have moved on. They rescue Sül and the rest of the madmen. As they try to make their escape on a chariot, the alarm is raised and they are pursued. They follow the Pathway of the Klaar towards the Master's lair. Eventually they pass into the forbidden lands and their pursuers give up the chase. Continuing to follow the Pathway of the Klaar, they are attacked by the birds-of-madness. Valérian and Laureline take shelter in a cave while the others form a shield around the entrance. This is not enough and Valérian and Laureline are bitten also. The attack passes and they find that they are almost at the bottom of the valley. A strange glow emanates from the mists. Reaching the source of the glow, they find the Master – a large amorphous grey blob. Laureline hits upon a plan – if they destroy the Pathways of Klaar, the Master will starve. Valérian begins firing but suddenly he breaks down on the ground – his mind has been attacked by the Master, presenting him with terrible images of war and destruction. Laureline takes up the gun but is also struck down, terrified by images of her body being torn to pieces by machinery. Similarly, Sül and the rest of the madmen are taken down one by one by the Master's superior mental powers. Laureline realises that problem is that they attacked one at a time. Gathering the others together, they hold hands and use their combined strength to overcome the Master's influence. Suddenly, the Master rips himself free and flees into the sky followed by the birds-of-madness and the mist. Realising they are free, the others consider settling in the Master's domain and living off the klaar. Valérian points out to them that it is not right to replace one dictator with another and they agree to return to the villages to free the others. Later, a large group of people work to free Valérian's astroship from the marsh in the graveyard of spaceships. The astroship blasts off with just one passenger, Sül, the rest having decided to stay on the asteroid. They wonder where the Master has gone to, blissfully unaware that he has attached himself to hull of their ship...

The mysterious Master has set up home here at the bottom of an immense valley dotted with volcanoes and shrouded in a thick fog. He is fed by a series of wooden channels, called the Pathways of Klaar, along which his food, known as klaar, is poured. Wind turbines provide the power to drive the klarr along the channels to the Master. The klarr is prepared in a great city, hewn out of the rock, at the head of the valley, decorated all over with carved sculptures made in honour of the Master, that acts as a great kitchen. Nearby lies a great pit into which those driven insane by the Birds-Of-Madness are thrown to end their days. Outside the valley lie many villages engaged in agriculture or fishing where the ingredients that make up the klaar are cultivated, reared or hunted. The Master adds to his army of servants by luring passing spacecraft and brings them to ground in a marshy area, near a huge set of falls, that forms a vast graveyard of spaceships.

Founded in 1924, Woolworths along with Coles forms a near-duopoly of Australian supermarkets, accounting for about 80% of the Australian market. Woolworths specialises in groceries (vegetables, fruit, meat, packaged foods, etc.), but also sells magazines, DVDs, health and beauty products, household products, pet and baby supplies, and stationery. As of August 2019, there were 981 Woolworths supermarkets and 43 Woolworths Metro convenience stores. Woolworths Online (formerly HomeShop) is a \\"click and collect\\" and home delivery service for Woolworths supermarkets. History Woolworths Limited (now Woolworths Group) was founded on 22 September 1924 by five Australian entrepreneursPercy Christmas, Stanley Chatterton, Cecil Scott Waine, George Creed and Ernest Williams. The first store was opened on 5 December 1924 in Pitt Street of Sydney's Imperial Arcade, called \\"Woolworths Stupendous Bargain Basement\\". Following the first store there were only 29 shareholders and there was little interest to accelerate the brand's growth. However, as trading continued and shareholders brought more capital, the dividends paid by the company increased from 5% to 50% after its third year of operation. Consumer interest in the company grew after December 1924, as more branches of the store were established across Australia. Woolworths stores began selling a variety of goods, claiming the lowest prices as well as money back guarantees. At the forefront of innovation in Australia, Woolworths stores became the first variety store in the world to install receipt printing cash register machines in 1926. The second Woolworths supermarket was opened on 6 August 1927, on Queen Street in Brisbane. The first Woolworths store in New Zealand was opened in 1929, but the chain has since been rebranded as Countdown . Following the opening of the Hobart store in 1940, Woolworths had a store in every state in Australia. With the company and its stores running successfully, Woolworths began to experiment with expanding their grocery rangemore stores began stocking fresh fruits and vegetables and a larger range of food. The first self-service store in Beverly Hills, Sydney was opened in 1955. In 1958 the first supermarket was opened at Dee Why, followed by the first purpose built supermarket at Warrawong in 1960. As Woolworths gradually focused more on groceries, the first Big W department store was opened in 1976 at Tamworth, New South Wales. In 2018, Woolworths Group made a historical decision to ban single-use plastic bags during checkout, along with Coles. In the first three months following the ban, Australian's plastic bag use dropped by 80%, leading to 1.5 billion fewer bags going to landfill. Woolworths also committed to removing 180 tonnes of plastic packaging from their products in 2018. =Acquisitions= In 1982, Woolworths Limited acquired two Tasmanian grocery brands: Roelf Vos and Purity, which were converted into Woolworths stores in 2000. After the arrival of American supermarket giant Safeway Inc. in Australia in 1962, Australian Safeway Pty Ltd was bought by Woolworths in 1985 . Woolworths Limited acquired all of the Safeway stores and the naming rights in exchange for a 19.99% equity interest in Woolworths Limited. At the time of the acquisition, Safeway had 126 stores across Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales. All Safeway stores in Queensland and New South Wales were rebranded as Woolworths supermarkets, but most Victorian stores continued trading as Safeway. In 2008, Woolworths announced it would rebrand Safeway stores as Woolworths, and this process was completed in June 2017. =Slogan= In 1987, Woolworths launched the \\"Fresh Food People\\" campaign after implementing new company protocols for their fresh food departments. The slogan changed slightly in 2012 to \\"Australia's Fresh Food People\\" to promote the fact that 96% of fresh produce sold in Woolworths supermarkets is grown in Australia. In 2014 the original \\"The Fresh Food People\\" slogan returned with a new lineup of television commercials. Loyalty schemes Loyalty schemes include a number of incentives for purchasing at their stores by subsidising petrol prices at Caltex Woolworths petrol stations and the now defunct Woolworths Plus Petrol. Discounts included 2-cent, 4-cent, 6-cent and in some regional areas 10-cent discounts on fuel, rewarded for purchases over certain amounts. =Woolworths Rewards and credit card= In September 2007, Woolworths began a trial in central-west New South Wales of Everyday Rewards, a Woolworths shopping card that automatically tracks supermarket purchases and fuel discounts, thus eliminating the need for shoppers to retain paper coupons. In addition it allows Woolworths to record purchases made by customers to offer them relevant promotions and for studies in demographics and marketing, hence incentives for customers who register their details. This followed Woolworths' announcement that it was planning to launch a general purpose credit card in 2008. Woolworths offered these credit card holders reward vouchers redeemable throughout its store network. Woolworths subsequently announced that the Woolworths Everyday Money MasterCard would be launched on 26 August 2008, allowing customers to earn shopping cards redeemable at Woolworths Group retailers. In February 2008, following the New South Wales trial, Woolworths announced that its Everyday Rewards card would be rolled out nationally. The implementation began with South Australia and Northern Territory in mid-February 2008, and to other states (excluding Tasmania) by the end of May 2008. During the NSW trial, 50,000 cards were issued to customers. Woolworths stated in June 2008 that \\"well over a million\\" shoppers had taken a card and registered their details. In August 2008, there were 3.8 million cards on issue, with 2.4 million cards registered. From June 2009, Everyday Rewards cardholders were able to earn Qantas Frequent Flyer points by using their Everyday Rewards cards. Cardholders who had successfully linked their Frequent Flyer card to their registered Everyday Rewards card can earn one Frequent Flyer point for every dollar over $30 that they spent in store. In August 2009, Woolworths announced that there were 3.8 million cards registered, of which 1.2 million were linked to a Qantas Frequent Flyer account. On 26 October 2015, Woolworths announced that customer loyalty cards would no longer earn Qantas Frequent Flyer points from 1 January 2016, instead receiving more discounts on groceries. The new discount program came into effect on 28 October 2015. Everyday Rewards cardholders were be sent new Woolworths Rewards cards. On 31 August 2016, Woolworths made significant changes to the rewards program in response to customer feedback. Cardholders are able to earn 1 point per $1 spent on eligible products at Woolworths Supermarkets and Caltex Woolworths branded fuel outlets. When 2000 points have been accrued, a $10 discount can be applied to their next eligible transaction in Woolworths Supermarkets. Customers were also given the choice to \\"bank\\" their discounts until Christmas time, with the discounts able to be spent from 1 December until 1 January each year. Woolworths also reintroduced the ability to earn Qantas Frequent Flyer points when customers use their Rewards card. When 2,000 points have been accrued, instead of receiving a $10 discount, those points can be periodically converted to Frequent Flyer points at a rate of 43.5 Frequent Flyer points per 100 Woolworths Rewards points. =Frequent Shopper Club= The Frequent Shopper Club, stylised as F$C, is a reward program for shopping in Woolworths stores in Tasmania. It was started by Purity Supermarkets in 1992, and is still in use today. The program offers a $20 voucher for every 2000 points accrued. As of November 2017, Woolworths launched a basic website for the Frequent Shopper Club. In July 2020, Woolworths announced that the program would be folded into the Everyday rewards program. Private label brands Woolworths has a range of generic or private label brands: *Essentials A budget label covering everyday household products and groceries. Products within this range typically feature a red and white Woolworths logo on the top left corner on the front side of the packaging. *Woolworths Food Range Woolworths' most populous own brand range, it features food lines in all categories across the store. Products in this range feature a green and white logo. Customer can become part of a food sampling group called \\"Bunch\\" in order to test foods within this range and provide feedback to make improvements. *Gold This own brand features premium products which are usually only available around Christmas time, and include products such as Christmas puddings, fruit mince pies and cakes. *Macro Wholefoods Market Macro features a range of foods that are free from artificial sweeteners, colours, flavours, added MSG and hydrogenated oils. Many products in this range are promoted as organic foods. *Delicious Nutritious This range is a collaboration between Woolworths and Australian personal trainer Michelle Bridges. The range is exclusively chilled and frozen meals, all of which include 2–3 serves of vegetables, grains and protein, and are all under 450 calories per serve. *The Odd Bunch This is a fresh produce brand which features fruit and vegetables, such as carrots, lemons and apples, that are oddly shaped or are otherwise imperfect. These products are sold at a cheaper price as a compromise to this. Other Woolworths Limited supermarkets * Countdown is the trading name in New Zealand. Woolworths also operated supermarket brands Foodtown and Woolworths until November 2011, which were rebranded as Countdown. * Flemings was a chain of supermarkets in Sydney and the Central Coast. On 19 May 2020, the final store in Jannali closed and was replaced with a Woolworths Metro store. * Woolworths Metro is a chain of convenience stores launched in 2013. The first store opened in Sydney, and the chain now has over 40 stores across Australia. Three of them are former Thomas Dux Grocer stores, while others are mostly placed within central business districts. * Food For Less was a discount supermarket chain located in Queensland and New South Wales. Since 2010 stores were either closed or rebranded to Woolworths, with the last store rebranded in 2018. * Safeway was the trading name of Woolworths for most of their Victorian stores until 2017 . * Thomas Dux Grocer was launched in 2008 in two New South Wales locations. The stores had a larger fresh food offering than traditional Woolworths stores, along with a larger delicatessen section. At its peak the chain had 11 stores. From 2014, the stores gradually closed and the chain ceased operation in late 2017. Three of the stores were retained under the \\"Woolworths Metro\\" brand; the other seven were either closed entirely or sold to other businesses. * Caltex Safeway operated service stations in Victoria until it was converted to Caltex Woolworths (now owned by Euro Garages Australia) in 2008–2010. * Roelf Vos and Purity were trading names used in Tasmania prior to being rebranded as Woolworths in 2000. Gallery Controversies =2020 spam marketing controversy= In July 2020, Woolworths were found guilty of breaching spam laws in excess of 5 million times and ignoring repeated consumer requests to unsubscribe from its marketing mailing lists. The Australian Communications and Media Authority found the supermarket giant had unlawfully spammed more than 1.2 million customers between October 2018 and July 2019. The supermarket was found to have repeatedly ignored consumers who had tried to prevent marketing emails being sent to their inboxes and had not attempted to improve its behaviour; despite the AMCA notifying the company that they had received customer complaints. ACMA chairman Nerida O'Loughlin said of the violation: > \\"The spam rules have been in place for 17 years and Woolworths is a large > and sophisticated organisation. The scale and prolonged nature of the non- > compliance is inexcusable.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald noted that the infringement notice of $1,003,800 is the biggest fine the AMCA has issued to date.

The encyclical posits that faith and reason are not only compatible, but essential together. He starts with \\"Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth;\\" Faith without reason, he argues, leads to superstition. Reason without faith, he argues, leads to nihilism and relativism. He writes: Although reason creates a \\"systematic body of knowledge,\\" the Pope avers, its completeness is illusory: Without a grounding in spiritual truth, he continues, reason has: On the roles of philosophy and speculative theology as manifested by Augustine: On the wrong turns in modern philosophy and the duty of the magisterium: In sum, the Pope \\"makes this strong and insistent appeal\\" that \\"faith and philosophy recover the profound unity which allows them to stand in harmony with their nature without compromising their mutual autonomy. The parrhesia of faith must be matched by the boldness of reason.

After his athletics career, he has been successful in events marketing and consulting. Early life and education Pascoe was born in Portsmouth, and lived in the Paulsgrove area of the city. He was educated at Portsmouth Southern Grammar School for Boys. He undertook higher education at Borough Road College, Isleworth, where he received a Certificate in Education, and the University of London, where he received an Honours degree in Education. He married sprinter Della James in 1970. They have one son and one daughter. Achievements as a competitor =Medals= Pascoe won medals in the Olympic Games, the European Championships, and the Commonwealth Games., also the European Indoor Games. After the 1974 Commonwealth Games victory Pascoe achieved a major distinction, in celebration he performed one of the great televised sporting bloopers. While doing his victory lap in reverse, Pascoe attempted to leap the last hurdle still remaining from the race and badly missed the hurdle, falling onto his back and denting the hurdle. Trying to regain his dignity, he circled around to attempt the jump the hurdle in another lane and fell identically. Laughing it off, he got up again and started turning over the other hurdles. . In winning the race he also achieved the minor distinction of running the seventh fastest 400-metre hurdle time, third fastest time by a British athlete, to that date (behind Jim Seymour, Ralph Mann, David Hemery and the then world record holder John Akii- Bua) at 48.8, despite running in the outside lane.

He thus needed paid employment during his athletics career. He was a teacher at Dulwich College (1971–1974), and a lecturer in physical education at Borough Road College, Isleworth (1974–1980). Pascoe was also able to get financial support during the 1970s from membership of several QUANGOs; the Sports Council (1974–1980), the Minister for Sports' Working Party on Centres of Sporting Excellence (1975–1979), and the BBC Advisory Council (1975–1979). After competitive athletics, Pascoe became involved in events marketing and consulting. He set up Alan Pascoe Associates Ltd. (later named API), of which he was Director (1976–1983), managing director (1983), Chairman (1985–1988) and CEO (1994–1998). Pascoe sold API in 1998, then started another company, Fast Track Events Ltd., of which he is the chairman. Pascoe was a summarizer with main commentator Adrian Metcalfe of ITV coverage of athletics during the mid/late 1970s and early 1980s. Other business appointments were as a Director of the Aegis Group (later named WCRS) (1986–1992) and Chairman of Carat Sponsorship (1987–1992). Pascoe criticised the British government for withdrawing from hosting the World Athletics Championships in 2001. He claimed that the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had broken a written undertaking to host the games. Pascoe believed that the decision amounted to the sport being cold-bloodedly \\"stabbed in the back\\". He believed that Blair had damaged Britain, by making the nation look foolish, and by causing the loss of both GBP 15–20 million in revenue, and a stadium suitable for top-class athletics. Such a stadium, he believed, was essential for developing home talent into world-class athletes. In September 2003, Pascoe was appointed vice-chairman of the London bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, which was ultimately successful. Honours Pascoe received an MBE in 1975 and an honorary doctorate from Brunel University in 1997.

The magazine worked toward the movement's goals of improving society by its advertisements of event choices for members to sponsor for their communities. The lyceum movement in the United States was a series of organizations which sponsored a variety of public education programs and entertainments. They flourished in the mid-19th century, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. Some of these organisations lasted until the early 20th century. Purpose The lyceums, mechanics’ institutes, and agriculture organizations like The Grange flourished in the U.S. before and after the Civil War. They were important in the development of adult education in America. During this period hundreds of informal associations were established for the purpose of improving the social, intellectual, and moral fabric of society. The lyceum movement featured lectures, dramatic performances, class instructions, and debates, by noted lecturers, entertainers and readers. They would travel the \\"lyceum circuit,\\" going from town to town or state to state to entertain, speak, or debate in a variety of locations, never staying in one place for too long. Their appearances were open to the public, which caused them to contribute significantly to the education of the adult American in the 19th century. Origins The first American lyceum, \\"Millbury Branch Number 1 of the American Lyceum,\\" was founded by Josiah Holbrook in 1826. Holbrook was a traveling lecturer and teacher who believed that education was a lifelong experience, and intended to create a National American Lyceum organization that would oversee this method of teaching. Other educators adopted the lyceum format but were not interested in organizing, so this idea was ultimately dropped. Peak of the movement The Lyceum Movement reached the peak of its popularity in the antebellum era. Public Lyceums were set up around the country, as far south as Florida and west as Detroit, Michigan. Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau endorsed the movement and gave speeches at many local lyceums. As a young man, Abraham Lincoln gave a speech to a Lyceum in Springfield, Illinois. Lyceum as entertainment After the American Civil War, lyceums were increasingly used as a venue for travelling entertainers, such as vaudeville and minstrel shows. They were also still used for public speeches and lectures. Notable public figures such as Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Victoria Woodhull, Anna Dickinson, Mark Twain, and William Lloyd Garrison, all spoke at lyceums in the late 19th century.

He spent most of his life promoting the movement and manufacturing scientific tools for use in lyceums.  Early life  Holbrook was born and raised on the family farm June 17, 1788, in Derby, Connecticut. His father was Colonel Daniel Holbrook.  Education  Holbrook received private education in the way of college prep studies under pastor Amasa Porter of Derby, England. He entered Yale College in 1806. While there scientist Benjamin Silliman got him interested in chemistry and mineralogy. He graduated from there in 1810. Holbrook then did some teaching in farm technology in the northeastern states, where he also lectured on geology.  Family  Holbrook married Lucy Swift in 1814. They had two sons. His wife died in 1819. Holbrook's parents died about this same time and he inherited the family farm. He then learned animal husbandry in addition to the scientific farm techniques he was already working with. Farming and agriculture was where he devoted his labors then.  Schools and lyceums  Holbrook organized the first industrial school in the United States. It was modeled after the agronomy ideas of Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg of Switzerland. Holbrook's school was the main motivator in the new movement of lyceum schooling and industrial training in the United States. Holbrook was the inspiration behind the American Lyceum Association, the second national education association. Its purpose was, (1) to get better government support for public schools; (2) to upgrade the skills of teachers; (3) to have college prep courses in public schools; (4) to upgrade school text books and materials of instruction; (5) to teach the natural sciences as regular courses; (6) to upgrade teaching equipment; and (7) to get young ladies involved in early education for careers. Holbrook published in early 1826 an article in Henry Barnard's Journal of Education proposing the organizing of the lyceum school concept. He then founded the first lyceum school in the United States. It was formed in Millbury, Massachusetts later in 1826. Towns in other States followed his example and by 1827 these other schools were combined together, forming the first nationwide organization of lyceum schools. He wanted a broad social structure that would provide a common education for young adults to help in their future careers. Holbrook was successful in his Boston business and used his profits for producing equipment to use in educational establishments. He traveled throughout the New England states promoting the lyceum school idea with instruction pamphlets he created and lectures he did. In 1832–1833 he edited the Family Lyceum. The lyceum system concept that Holbrook started flourished in New England and the Midwestern United States. It served as a platform for scientific techniques, scholar endeavors, religion, and politics. It helped promote a need for a uniform educational system in the United States that would include professional teacher training. Some notable speakers in these Lyceum schools included Louis Agassiz, Daniel Webster, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Frederick Douglass, and Susan B. Anthony. Holbrook attempted an international lyceum, however other formal educational systems eventually took the place of his schools and the lyceum idea was discontinued in the early 20th century.  Later life and death  Holbrook moved to Washington, D.C. in the later 1840s. He continued to write articles promoting the concept of the lyceum school. He went on geological expeditions and on one such trip at Lynchburg, Virginia, in 1854 he drowned at Blackwater Creek.

Après une lecture du Dante: Fantasia quasi Sonata (French for After a Reading of Dante: Fantasia quasi Sonata; also known as the Dante Sonata) is a piano sonata in one movement, completed by Hungarian composer Franz Liszt in 1849. It was first published in 1856 as part of the second volume of his Années de pèlerinage (Years of Pilgrimage). This work of program music was inspired by the reading of Dante Alighieri's most famous epic poem, the Divine Comedy.  Background  Introduction The Dante Sonata was originally a small piece entitled Fragment after Dante, consisting of two thematically related movements, which Liszt composed in the late 1830s. He gave the first public performance in Vienna, during November 1839. When he settled in Weimar in 1849, he revised the work along with others in the volume, and gave it its present title derived from Victor Hugo's own work of the same name. It was published in 1858 as part of Années de pèlerinage.  Composition  The second subject is a derivation of the first The piece is divided into two main subjects. The first, a chromatic theme in D minor, typifies the wailing of souls in Hell. D minor is a common key for music relating to death, as evidenced by Liszt's Totentanz and the statue scene of Wolfgang Mozart's Don Giovanni. The first theme also heavily uses the tritone (augmented 4th or diminished 5th); this interval was known as the Devil's interval (or \\"Devil in music\\") and further reinforces the hellish imagery. The second theme is a beatific chorale in F-sharp major, derived from the first, which represents the joy of those in Heaven. The key is also symbolic here, being the signature for other uplifting works of Liszt's, including Benediction of God in Solitude (part of Harmonies poétiques et religieuses) and Les Jeux d'eaux à la Villa d'Este (Années de pèlerinage, Vol. 3, No. 4). The secondary theme may also represent Beatrice, as it is interspersed within chromatic areas, similar to the character's appearances in hell. The piece ends with a rapid chromatic octave section that when played at speed seems to split into three distinct themes, reflecting the three heads of Satan in Dante's Inferno.

The offensive team must put the ball in play by either snapping the ball during a scrimmage down or kicking the ball during a free kick down before the time expires, or else they will be assessed a 5-yard delay of game (American football) or time count violation (Canadian football; that code's \\"delay of game\\" is a different infraction) penalty. If a visible clock is not available or not functioning, game officials on the field will use a stopwatch or other similar device to enforce the rule. In all levels of Canadian football, the offensive team must run a play within 20 seconds of the referee whistling the play in; in amateur American football, teams have 25 seconds from the time the ball is declared ready for play. In the NFL, teams have 40 seconds timed from the end of the previous down. Before 2008, in college football, the play clock was 25 seconds after the ball was set, but the clock was not stopped for the ball to be set unless the previous play resulted in a stoppage of the clock. Now, the same intervals as the NFL are used, with minor differences for the final two minutes of each half.\\"NCAA Football Rules Committee Proposes Rules to Enhance Student-Athlete Safety and Encourage Consistent Pace of Play\\" In high school football, starting with the 2019 season, teams will use the 40-second play clock as in the NCAA and NFL, with minor exceptions. \\"40-Second Play Clock, Postseason Instant Replay Among Football Changes\\" Various professional leagues have used their own standards; the original XFL and Alliance of American Football, for instance, used a 35-second play clock to encourage faster play; the revived XFL uses a play clock measured 25 seconds from the spotting of the ball. Arena football used a 32-second play clock. Also in the Canadian Football League, a time count is enforced differently at certain points of the game. If the time count occurs before the three-minute mark of a half, the penalty is five yards and the down is repeated. In the final three minutes, the penalty is a loss of down on first and second down or 10 yards, with the down repeated, on third down. If the referee deems a time count committed on third down in the last three minutes of a half to be deliberate, he also has the right to require the offensive team to put the ball in play legally within 20 seconds or else forfeit possession. (Time counts during convert attempts, during which the ball is live but the clock does not run, are 5-yard penalties with the down repeated at all times in the game.) In the strategy of clock management, a team can slow the pace of a game by taking the maximum amount of time allotted between plays. A team wishing to do so would wait to snap the ball until there is one second left on the play clock. In many football games, the play clock is managed by the back judge who is positioned behind the defense and faces the quarterback. When the play clock counts down to 5 seconds remaining, some back judges will raise their arm over their head to warn the quarterback, and rotate their arm downward to their leg, counting down the final seconds. A penalty flag for delay is thrown afterward. The infraction typically results in a five-yard penalty.

After his divorce from wife Cynthia, the island went unused until Lennon invited \\"King of the Hippies\\" Sid Rawle and Timi Walsh to establish a commune on the island in 1970. For the next two years, a group of 25 hippies called Dorinish home. In 1972 a fire burned down the island's supply tent and the commune disbanded. After Lennon's death, Yoko Ono sold the island for nearly £30,000 and donated the proceeds to an Irish orphanage. Dorinish is now used as a grazing site for livestock and is sometimes visited by enthusiastic Beatles fans. An artists' summer school \\"Aerial Blue\\" was held on the island in July 2011.

It is operated by Hospital Corporation of America  History  Medical City opened its doors after Dr. Frank Seay cut the ribbon that opened Medical City Dallas Hospital to the residents of the community on October 2, 1974. Developer Trammell Crow and his partners chose to locate the hospital and medical office tower on a 250-acre plot in the Park Central area of Dallas partly because preliminary research showed that as of 1972 when the development was planned, 85 percent of all MDs in Dallas County lived within 15 minutes'driving of the new complex.(Unnamed author.) \\"Medical City Dallas will be strictly '20th century',\\" The Dallas Morning News, 30 April 1972, page 14.

Retrieved from NewsBank 30 April 2016. ($113 million in 2015 dollars). Surveys as of early 1972 showed that prior to the opening of the hospital, Dallas had six hospital beds per 1000 people, while eight cities of comparable size averaged just over 9.1 beds per 1000 people. The 14-story, 367-bed hospital had 78 physicians on the medical staff and enough staff to care for an 85 percent occupancy rate. In describing the original plan, co- managing partner Robert J. Wright touted the updated 20th-century concept of combining hospital-related facilities on the same site with the hospital itself: \\"For too long, many doctors have had to practice 20th century medicine in 19th century facilities, with their offices at one location, their hospital at another, lab, X-ray and other vital services at still another, and all at great distances from each other and from their homes.\\" Additional features of the design included separate entrances for patients and for doctors to facilitate doctors' ability to \\"from their entrance, go directly to ancillary services or make rounds in the hospital, and then proceed to their offices,\\" as well as the location of doctors' offices nearest to the most relevant department for their specialties, such as locating the cardiologists' offices next to the ECG and stress laboratories.\\"(Unnamed author.) \\"Medical City Dallas to open,\\" The Dallas Morning News, 22 September 1974, page 5.

After the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, Afro-Guyanese people came together to develop small villages. They were not given land to compensate for their labor, unlike future immigrant groups. When planters made land or passage home available to East Indians as part of the terms of indentured labour in the late 19th century, given that they had denied land to the Africans as emancipated slaves several decades earlier, it created tension among the ethnic groups. By the early twentieth century, the majority of the urban population of the country was Afro-Guyanese. Many Afro-Guyanese people living in villages had migrated to the towns in search of work. Until the 1930s, Afro-Guyanese people, especially those of mixed descent, comprised the bulk of the non-white professional class. During the 1930s, as Indo-Guyanese began to enter the middle class in large numbers, they began to compete with Afro-Guyanese for professional positions.  History  The Dutch West India Company turned to the importation of African slaves, who rapidly became a key element in the colonial economy. By the 1660s, the slave population numbered about 2,500; the number of indigenous people was estimated at 50,000, most of whom had retreated into the vast hinterland. Although African slaves were considered an essential element of the colonial economy, their working conditions were brutal. The mortality rate was high, and the dismal conditions led to more than half a dozen slave rebellions. The most famous slave uprising, the Berbice Slave Uprising, began in February 1763. On two plantations on the Canje River in Berbice, slaves rebelled, taking control of the region. As plantation after plantation fell to the slaves, the European population fled; eventually only half of the whites who had lived in the colony remained. Led by Cuffy (now the national hero of Guyana), the African freedom fighters came to number about 3,000 and threatened European control over the Guianas. The freedom fighters were defeated with the assistance of troops from neighboring French and British colonies and from Europe. Colonial life was changed radically by the demise of slavery. Although the international slave trade was abolished in the British Empire in 1807, slavery itself continued. In what is known as the Demerara rebellion of 1823 10–13,000 slaves in Demerara-Essequibo rose up against their masters. Although the rebellion was easily crushed, the momentum for abolition remained, and by 1838 total emancipation had been effected. The end of slavery had several ramifications. Most significantly, many former slaves rapidly departed the plantations. Some ex-slaves moved to towns and villages, feeling that field labor was degrading and inconsistent with freedom, but others pooled their resources to purchase the abandoned estates of their former masters and created village communities. Establishing small settlements provided the new Afro-Guyanese communities an opportunity to grow and sell food, an extension of a practice under which slaves had been allowed to keep the money that came from the sale of any surplus produce. The emergence of an independent-minded Afro-Guyanese peasant class, however, threatened the planters' political power, inasmuch as the planters no longer held a near-monopoly on the colony's economic activity. Emancipation also resulted in the introduction of new ethnic and cultural groups into British Guiana. The departure of the Afro-Guyanese from the sugar plantations soon led to labor shortages. After unsuccessful attempts throughout the 19th century to attract Portuguese workers from Madeira, the estate owners were again left with an inadequate supply of labor. The Portuguese had not taken to plantation work and soon moved into other parts of the economy, especially retail business, where they became competitors with the new Afro-Guyanese middle class. Later many East Indian immigrants arrived as indentured, and would later grow into a thriving and competitive class.

International context  Though creationism and intelligent design are not supported by many mainstream scientists, there are significant minorities in the general public in most developed countries that say they doubt or reject the theory of evolution, likely because of their religious beliefs. In underdeveloped countries where rates of religious belief are much higher, support of evolution is consequently lower.  Europe  In Europe, religion generally has much less influence on politics than in the United States or the developing world. Despite this, there are pockets of creationist and intelligent design activity. = Council of Europe = The Council of Europe's Committee on Culture, Science and Education released a report in June 2007 entitled \\"The Dangers of Creationism in Education\\". One of the council members, Anne Brasseur said that the aim of the report was to anchor evolution in school curricula, and warned that there was still resistance in many European countries. She provided the following examples in an interview with German newspaper Der Spiegel: * A former deputy education minister of Poland called the theory of evolution a lie. * Activism against teaching evolution in grade school by some Russian parents * A 2004 proposed decree against evolution * A proposed \\"Genesis-Land\\" theme park in Switzerland based on the Creation Museum in Kentucky. * Creationist lectures and symposia in the United Kingdom * The publication and free distribution of the \\"Atlas of Creation\\" by Harun Yahya in Turkey * The Ministry of Education for the German state of Hesse allowing the teaching of theory of creation in biology class * The publishing house \\"Studiengemeinschaft Wort und Wissen\\" is now publishing the sixth edition of a grade school textbook that includes the theory of intelligent design.  North America  = Canada = Unlike in the United States the issue has never been the subject of a major Supreme Court case, nor does it figure prominently in the national media. In Canada, education is the constitutional responsibility of the provinces. No province has taught creationism in its official public school curriculum in modern times, however, there are various different approaches to the teaching of evolution and religion across the country, as well as various exceptions for separate schools (publicly funded religious school, primarily Catholic), private schools, alternative schools, Reserve schools, charter schools, and so on. In most provincial curricula (excluding Quebec, where it has been mandatory in elementary schools since 2004) evolutionary theory is only required in Grade 11 or 12; however, it can be taught earlier at the discretion of local school boards and teachers. Around 63,000 Canadian children attend \\"Christian\\" (primarily evangelical) schools outside of the provincial systems (which include both the public [secular] and Catholic schools), where they are generally taught creationism rather than evolution. In 2006, the ministry of education in Quebec ordered unlicensed private evangelical Christian schools to start teaching evolution and sexual education, otherwise the schools would be closed. In Ontario, private schools are not required to teach either evolution or sex education. In 2009, the government under the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta introduced Bill 44 which allows parents to pull their children out of public school classrooms if they disagree with the controversial subject matter being discussed (such as evolution or homosexuality). Later amendments to the bill clarified that parents could choose to pull their children from religion classes, but not from science classes. = United States = A number of specific political strategies and tactics have been employed by intelligent design proponents. These range from attempts at the state level to undermine or remove altogether the presence of evolutionary theory from the public school classroom, to having the federal government mandate the teaching of intelligent design, to 'stacking' municipal, county and state school boards with intelligent design proponents. The Discovery Institute has been driving force in most cases, providing a range of support from material assistance to federal, state and regional elected representatives in the drafting of bills to supporting and advising individual parents confronting their school boards. A feature of the Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns has been extensive lobbying and public relations campaigns conducted on behalf of intelligent design proponents in order to overcome professional setbacks such as that of Guillermo Gonzalez, Richard Sternberg and Francis Beckwith. These efforts are focused on two efforts: the Teach the Controversy and Critical Analysis of Evolution campaigns. These campaigns gained prominence after the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial where Judge John E. Jones III ruled that teaching intelligent design or presenting it as an alternative to evolution was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because intelligent design is not legitimate science but essentially religious in nature. available at Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover, Conclusion Both the Teach the Controversy and Critical Analysis of Evolution strategies and resources for them come from the Discovery Institute and its Center for Science and Culture, the hub of the intelligent design movement. These strategies are seen as another iteration of the Discovery Institute's campaign to \\"defeat [the] materialist world view\\" represented by the theory of evolution in favor of \\"a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions\\".. Cited in According to the Center for Science and Culture's weblog,Evolution News and Views at least 10 state legislatures are now considering legislation reconsidering how evolution is taught. Many of these initiatives benefit from significant legal assistance from a number of conservative legal foundations including the Thomas More Law Center, the Alliance Defense Fund, and Quality Science Education for All (QSEA). All have litigated extensively on behalf of the movement. Specific cases =1999 & 2005 creationist Kansas Boards of Education= In 1999 the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete references to evolution from Kansas science standards. This had the net effect of removing the teaching of evolution from the state's science curriculum. The move angered the mainstream science community which predicted a resulting loss of rigor and quality in science education. The Board's decision was in part influenced by the presence of recently elected conservative Christians to the board and heavy lobbying by the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, then known as the \\"Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture\\" (CRSC). Subsequent elections altered the membership of the school board and led to renewed backing for evolution instruction in 2001. Elections in 2004 gave religious conservatives a contentious 6-4 majority. The board in 2005 was finalizing new science standards which would have guided teachers about how and what to teach students. A proposal advanced by conservatives and intelligent design proponents, with support from the Center for Science and Culture, was similar to the Critical Analysis of Evolution plan for which the Center lobbied the Ohio Board of Education in 2002. It would not have eliminated evolution entirely from instruction, nor would it require intelligent design to be presented as an alternative to evolution, but the Critical Analysis of Evolution plan treated evolution as a flawed theory, a position that defied mainstream scientific views. On 8 November 2005, the Kansas Board of Education, chaired by veterinarian Steve Abrams, approved new science teaching standards that included the Critical Analysis of Evolution. The Discovery Institute was key in the drafting and adoption of the new standards which were approved by 6 to 4, reflecting the makeup of religious conservatives on the board.https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2005-11-08-kansas-science- standards_x.htm, Greg Toppo, USA Today Critics of the new Kansas standards noted that they promoted the teaching of intelligent design. Kansas standards previously supported evolutionary theory, which held that all life had a common origin. Creationists claimed that theory had been challenged by their interpretation of fossils and molecular biology. They had also echoed the standard intelligent design argument that there is a controversy as to whether changes over time in one species can lead to a new species.Mercury News After the board of education decided to include more criticism of evolution in its school science standards, a University of Kansas professor, Paul Mirecki, proposed to teach a class called \\"Special Topics in Religion: intelligent design, Creationism and other Religious Mythologies.\\" The class was cancelled and the professor was forced to resign as chairman of the university's religious studies department. Mirecki had alleged that he was also assaulted and beaten by creationists who opposed his teaching of the class, CNN In primary election held on August 1, 2006, pro-creationist conservative Republicans lost their 6-4 board majority when incumbent Connie Morris from Cheyenne County, Kansas, was defeated by moderate Republican Sally Cauble, of Liberal, Kansas. Another slot which until then was held by a retiring conservative whose son-in-law from Idaho, Brad Patzer, ran for her office, was won by Jana Shaver, a pro-science Republican from Independence, Kansas. Morris had described evolution in a taxpayer-funded constituent newsletter as \\"an age-old fairy tale\\" and \\"a nice bedtime story\\" unsupported by science. The fate of Education Commissioner and former Koch brothers Kansas Policy Institute director, Bob Corkins, was sealed by the ouster of the anti- evolutionists in 2006. He was an appointee of the board's creationists and endured strong criticism for his lack of previous educational leadership experience. Republican state Sen. John Vratil, characterized Corkins' hiring as education commissioner as \\"sort of like making Saddam Hussein president of the United States.\\" The executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, Paul Houston, had written a letter referring to Corkins as an \\"amateur.\\"He Don't Need No Education, The Pitch, Justin Kendall, December 1, 2005. Retrieved 25 August 2016. =2000 Congressional briefing= In 2000, the leading intelligent design proponents operating through the Discovery Institute held a congressional briefing in Washington, D.C., to promote intelligent design to lawmakers. Sen. Rick Santorum was (and continues to be) one of intelligent design's most vocal supporters. One result of this briefing was that Sen. Santorum inserted pro-intelligent design language into the No Child Left Behind bill calling for students to be taught why evolution \\"generates so much continuing controversy,\\" an assertion heavily promoted by the Discovery Institute. =2001 Santorum Amendment= The Santorum Amendment was a failed proposed amendment to the 2001 education act No Child Left Behind of 2001. The inclusion of the amendment in the Act was heavily lobbied for by the Discovery Institute, which also participated in the drafting of the original language of the amendment. Although only a modified form of the amendment appeared in the conference report, the amendment itself was not included in the legislation that President George W. Bush signed. It was not the victory intelligent design proponents had hoped for. Conference reports do not carry the weight of law and are merely explanatory in nature,Congress Urges Teaching of Diverse Views on Evolution, but Darwinists Try to Deny It, Center for Science and Culture and, in any case, the amendment failed. Nonetheless, an email newsletter by the Discovery Institute contained the sentence \\"Undoubtedly this will change the face of the debate over the theories of evolution and intelligent design in America. ... It also seems that the Darwinian monopoly on public science education, and perhaps the biological sciences in general, is ending\\" and Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas cited the amendment as vindicating the 1999 Kansas school board decision (since overturned) to eliminate evolution questions from State tests. Consistent with the Wedge strategy its inclusion in the conference report on the failed amendment continues to be incorrectly cited by the Discovery Institute and other intelligent design supporters as providing federal sanction for intelligent design. Reps. John Boehner and Steve Chabot of Ohio and Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, along with Santorum, have signed letters supporting the Discovery Institute's interpretation of the Santorum amendment. One of those letters was sent to the president and vice-president of the Ohio Board of Education in 2002; the other was sent to the Texas Board of Education in 2003, see below. =2001 Louisiana, House Bill 1286= This bill directs that the state shall not print or distribute any material containing claims known to be false or fraudulent. It also specifically provides for any citizen to be able to sue the state using the provisions of this bill.Louisiana, House Bill 1286 =2001 Michigan, House Bill 4382= A bill proposed by Rep. Gosselin (House Bill 4382) which sought to amend 1976 PA 451, \\"The revised school code\\". The bill directed that In the science standards, all references to \\"evolution\\" and \\"how species change through time\\" would be modified to indicate that this is an unproven theory, by adding the phrase \\"all students will explain the competing theories of evolution and natural selection based on random mutation and the theory that life is the result of the purposeful, intelligent design of a creator.\\" The bill also directed that in the science standards for middle and high school, all references to \\"evolution\\" and \\"natural selection\\" would be modified to indicate that these are unproven theories, by adding the phrase \\"describe how life may be the result of the purposeful, intelligent design of a creator.\\" And in the science standards for middle and high school, the bill directed all references to \\"evolution\\" and \\"natural selection\\" would be modified to indicate that these are unproven theories, by adding the phrase \\"explain the competing theories of evolution and natural selection based on random mutation and the theory that life is the result of the purposeful, intelligent design of a creator.\\" The bill also would have required that the recommended model core academic curriculum content standards that are developed and periodically updated by the state board comply with these provisions. Also under the bill the State Board would have been required to make these revisions as soon as practicable after the effective date of the bill, if it had been enacted. Text of HB4382 (PDF) =2001 Georgia, House Bill 391= This bill directed teachers to distinguish between \\"philosophical materialism\\" and \\"authentic science\\", and extended to teachers the \\"right\\" to present and critique any scientific theory of the origins or life or species. Failed in committee.Georgia House Bill 391 =2001 West Virginia, House Bill 2554= An \\"equal-time\\" bill, described in its title as \\"Providing for the teaching of creation science and evolution science on an equal basis in the public schools.\\" HB2554 was introduced in the state legislature in February 2001, and died in committee. =2001 Kanawha County, West Virginia= In February 2001 a parent filed a complaint with the Kanawha County Board of Education claiming that science textbooks used there contain \\"false and fraudulent\\" information about evolution. The parent and 30 cosigners opposed to evolution asserted that the textbooks are in violation of state law because they are outdated or inaccurate. As evidence that textbooks which include evolution are flawed, they cited Jonathan Well's of the Discovery Institute book Icons of Evolution. The board rejected the claim. =2001 Arkansas, House Bill 2548= In 2001 Representative Jim Holt proposed a bill in the Arkansas legislature that would make it illegal for the state or any of its agencies to use state funds to purchase materials that contained false or fraudulent claims. A list of such claims was provided in the text of House Bill 2548 (HB2548). Much of the text of the examples given was either quoted verbatim from anti-evolutionary sources or was a close paraphrase of such materials. The sources cited in the bill included the cartoon tract, \\"Big Daddy?\\"Big Daddy?, Jack Chick published by Jack Chick. Critics of the bill alleged that many of the \\"examples\\" selected were themselves either false or misleading. March 21, 2001, Representative Holt invited his friend and controversial anti-evolutionist Kent Hovind to testify before a committee of the Arkansas Legislature in support of the bill. In April 2001 a motion was passed to postpone HB 2548 indefinitely for study during the interim by the Joint Interim Committee on Education.Internet Archive version of Arkansas House Bill 2548 =2001 Montana, House Bill 588= House Bill 588 by Rep. Joe Balyeat, R-Bozeman, was presented as an \\"objectivity in science education\\" measure, and would have directed the approval of evolution and creationism materials by an appointed six-member committee. The bill failed in committee. = 2001 Pennsylvania Board of Education = In July 2001 the Pennsylvania Board of Education gave final approval to revised science standards. Language in early versions of the standards sought to raise questions about the status of evolution as science and a theory. Science educators and other Pennsylvania citizens expressed concern that the proposed standards might open the way to teaching creationism in science classes because of ambiguous or unclear wording. However, the final standards do not contain the contested language and the standards were approved by the legislature. =2002 Ohio Board of Education= In March 2002 Ohio held hearings on revising the state science standards. The Discovery Institute's Stephen C. Meyer proposed to the Ohio Board of Education the Institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution that featured intelligent design prominently in its curricula.Critical Analysis of Evolution model lesson plan Discovery Institute.Teach the Controversy, Stephen C. Meyer, Cincinnati EnquirerThe Crusade Against Evolution , Evan Ratliff, Wired Magazine Concurrently, a factitious redefinition of science to include God was proposed to the Ohio legislature, so that the legislature would then be able to get behind the set of standards that included intelligent design. The Discovery Institute's model lesson plan was adopted in part by the state for Ohio science teachers in October 2002, though the Board advised that the science standards do \\"not mandate the teaching or testing of intelligent design\\".Resolution of intent to adopt science standards This was touted as a significant victory by the Discovery Institute.Good News from Ohio: Teaching the Controversy, Charles Colson In February 2006, the Ohio Board of Education voted 11-4 to delete the science standard and correlating lesson plan adopted in 2002., CNN The board also rejected a competing plan from intelligent design proponents to request a legal opinion from the state attorney general on the constitutionality of the science standards. Intelligent design proponents pledged to force another vote on the issue. =2002 Cobb County, Georgia= In 2002 the Cobb County school board required stickers placed in a science textbook. Stating that evolution was \\"a theory, not a fact,\\" the sticker was placed in the ninth-grade biology text after parents complained to the Cobb County school board that alternative ideas about the origin of life were not presented. A group of parents represented by the American Civil Liberties Union sued the school board, claiming the stickers violate the separation of church and state. The trial was resolved in January 2005 when U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled the sticker was unconstitutional. In the verdictOrder, Selman v. Cobb County School District he wrote, \\"By denigrating evolution, the school board appears to be endorsing the well-known prevailing alternative theory, creationism or variations thereof, even though the sticker does not specifically reference any alternative theories.\\" In December 2005 the federal appeal court panel made comments sharply criticising the lower court ruling in advance of releasing their decision. Judge Ed Carnes said that the words on the sticker are \\"technically accurate,\\" and that \\"From nonlife to life is the greatest gap in scientific theory. There is less evidence supporting it than there is for other theories. It sounds to me like evolution is more vulnerable and deserves more critical thinking,\\" suggesting that he did not understand the distinction between evolution and abiogenesis.Appeals Panel Criticizes Evolution Ruling, Ellen Barry, Los Angeles Times, December 16, 2005 In December 2006 Cobb County School Board agreed to settle the long-running legal case. The county will not order the placement of \\"any stickers, labels, stamps, inscriptions, or other warnings or disclaimers bearing language substantially similar to that used on the sticker that is the subject of this action.\\"Americans United Applauds Settlement Of Georgia Lawsuit Over Evolution Disclaimer , Americans United for Separation of Church and State =2003 Texas State Board of Education, textbook controversy= In 2003 The Texas State Board of Education was considering 11 different textbooks for inclusion in the 2004-2005 school year. Fellows of the Discovery Institute testified to the Board that whatever textbooks are adopted should introduce statements on the \\"weaknesses of the theory of evolution\\" and include \\"competing theories, such as intelligent design.\\" The DI had strong interest in the Texas debate because the state is the second largest purchaser of textbooks in the country. Thus any changes publishers make to cater to the state would likely be seen elsewhere. =2004/2005 Richard Sternberg= The Sternberg peer review controversy arose over whether an article published in a scientific journal that supported the controversial concept of intelligent design was properly peer reviewed. The journal's editor, Richard Sternberg, was an active proponent of intelligent design with ties to the Discovery Institute, and the article's author, Stephen C. Meyer, is an official of the Discovery Institute. The journal's publisher ultimately withdrew Meyer's article saying Sternberg published it outside of the normal review process, a statement Sternberg disputes. In the course of his defense Sternberg claimed he was the subject of religious discrimination due to his belief in intelligent design by the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, where he served as an unpaid research associate. Sternberg's claim is contradicted by John G. West, Vice President and Senior Fellow of the Discovery Institute and Associate Director of the Institute's Center for Science & Culture who wrote, \\"The first misunderstanding is the belief that intelligent design is based on religion rather than science. Intelligent design is a scientific inference based on empirical evidence, not on religious texts.\\" Despite West's clear rejection of Sternberg's claim, Republican representatives, other Discovery Institute affiliates and intelligent design advocates Mark Souder and Rick Santorum authored a report supporting Sternberg's claim of discrimination.Intolerance and Politicization of Science at the Smithsonian United States House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform, December 2006.Appendix to Intolerance and the Politicization of Science at the Smithsonian United States House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform, December 2006.Lame Ducks Weigh In Reed A. Cartwright. PandasThumb.org, December 15, 2006 The report was commissioned by Souder in his capacity as subcommittee chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform but published by Souder as an individual representative without it gaining any official standing by the Committee, which never formally accepted it. =2005 Pennsylvania, House Bill 1007= On March 16, 2005, a bill, HB 1007, promoting \\"intelligent design\\" creationism was introduced in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and referred to the Education Committee. If enacted, HB 1007 would add a section (\\"Teaching Theories on the Origin of Man and Earth\\") to the Public School Code of 1949. That new section would allow school boards to add \\"intelligent design\\" to any curriculum containing evolution and allow teachers to use, subject to the approval of the board, \\"supporting evidence deemed necessary for instruction on the theory of intelligent design.\\" The term \\"intelligent design\\" is not defined in the bill. Presumably attempting to prevent a challenge to its constitutionality, HB 1007 explicitly states, \\"When providing supporting evidence on the theory of intelligent design, no teacher in a public school may stress any particular denominational, sectarian or religious belief.\\"Pennsylvania House Bill 1007 In June 2005 John G. West and Seth Cooper of the Discovery Institute wrote a letter to Pennsylvania Representative Jess M. Stairs urging Stairs and the Pennsylvania legislature not to pass HB1007. This reflects a shift in the strategy of the intelligent design proponents. Anticipating legal challenges to the constitutionality of laws that mandate teaching of intelligent design, proponents feel including intelligent design content in science curricula under the guise of \\"scientific criticisms\\" or \\"evidence against evolution,\\" within the pretense of \\"teaching the controversy\\" is a more defensible strategy. =2005 Kansas evolution hearings= A series of hearings instigated by the Discovery Institute held in Topeka, Kansas May 2005 by the Kansas State Board of Education to review changes how the origin of life would be taught in the state's public high school science classes. The hearings were boycotted by the scientific community, and views expressed represented largely those of intelligent design advocates. The result of the hearings was the adoption of new science standards by the fundamentalist-dominated board in defiance of the State Board Science Hearing Committee that relied upon the institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan and adopted the institute's Teach the Controversy approach. In August 2006 conservative Republicans lost their majority on the board in a primary election. The moderate Republican and Democrats gaining seats vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board. On the 13th of February, 2007, the Kansas State Board of Education approved a new curriculum which removed any reference to Intelligent Design as part of science. In the words of Dr Bill Wagnon, the board chairman, \\"Today the Kansas Board of Education returned its curriculum standards to mainstream science\\". The new curriculum, as well as a document outlining the differences with the previous curriculum, has been posted on the Kansas State Department of Education's website.Science Curricular Standards , Kansas State Department of Education =2005/2004 Dover, Pennsylvania Board of Education= In 2004 the Dover, Pennsylvania Board of Education passed a resolution requiring 9th grade biology teachers to read a statement that the Pennsylvania Academic Standards require the teaching of evolution, but then the statement proceeds to seed doubts about evolution's validity and directs students to study intelligent design and the intelligent design textbook Of Pandas and People as an alternative. Three of the school board members in the minority of the vote resigned in protest, and science teachers in the district refused to read the statement to their ninth-grade students, citing the Pennsylvania code of education, which states that teachers cannot present information they believe to be false. Instead, the statement was read to students by a school administrator. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of eleven parents contending that the school board policy violates the First Amendment. A hearing (Kitzmiller et al. v. Dover Area School District) in Federal District Court was scheduled for September 2005. The school board claims there are \\"gaps\\" in evolution, which it emphasizes is a theory rather than established fact, and that students have a right to consider other views on the origins of life. The school board claims it does not teach intelligent design but simply makes students aware of its existence as an alternative to evolution. It denies intelligent design is \\"religion in disguise,\\" despite being represented in court by the Thomas More Law Center, a conservative Christian nonprofit which says it uses litigation to promote \\"the religious freedom of Christians and time-honored family values.\\" The Discovery Institute's John West said the case displayed the ACLU's \\"Orwellian\\" effort to stifle scientific discourse and objected to the issue being decided in court. \\"It's a disturbing prospect that the outcome of this lawsuit could be that the court will try to tell scientists what is legitimate scientific inquiry and what is not,\\" West said. \\"That is a flagrant assault on free speech.\\" Opponents, represented by the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Association of Biology Teachers contend that his statement is not just ironic, but hypocritical, considering that the Discovery Institute not only tries to tell scientists and academics what is legitimate scientific inquiry and what is not (in disputing philosophical naturalism), but as a matter of policy seeks to redefine what constitutes legitimate science. In May, 2005, the publisher of Of Pandas and People, the Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE), filed a motion seeking to intervene in the case. FTE argued that a ruling that \\"intelligent design\\" was religious would have severe financial consequences, citing possible losses in the neighborhood of half a million dollars. By intervening, FTE would have become a co-defendant with the Dover Area School Board, and able to bring its own lawyers and expert witnesses to the case. FTE's president Jon Buell implied that if allowed to intervene, FTE would bring William A. Dembski and Stephen C. Meyer as expert witnesses. In his decision on the motion, Judge John E. Jones III ruled that FTE was not entitled to intervene in the case because its motion to intervene was not timely, describing FTE's excuses for not trying to become involved earlier as \\"both unavailing and disingenuous.\\" Judge Jones also held that FTE failed to demonstrate that it has \\"a significantly protectable interest in the litigation warranting intervention as a party\\" and that its interests will not be adequately represented by the defendants. In a November 2005 election the citizens of Dover voted out their pro-intelligent design schoolboard.Intelligent Design Candidates Voted Out in Penn.. This event prompted Pat Robertson on his 700 Club broadcast to announce that the people of Dover had lost their protection from God: \\"I'd like to say to the good citizens of Dover. If there is a disaster in your area, don’t turn to God, you just rejected Him from your city. And don’t wonder why He hasn't helped you when problems begin, if they begin. I'm not saying they will, but if they do, just remember, you just voted God out of your city. And if that’s the case, don’t ask for His help because he might not be there.\\" , CNN On December 20, 2005, U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III, in his 139-page ruling on Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, struck down the school board's policy requiring a statement be read endorsing intelligent design as an alternative to evolution in 9th grade high school biology classes. In his ruling Jones wrote that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature.Opinion , Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District In response the Discovery Institute accused Judge Jones of being an \\"activist judge\\".Dover Intelligent Design Decision Criticized as a Futile Attempt to Censor Science Education, Robert Crowther, Evolution News & Views, Discovery Institute =2006 Ohio - Proposed Template for Ohio Teachers= A 2006 proposal before the Ohio Board of Education drafted by Conservative Board member Colleen Grady, would create a \\"template\\" based on the Discovery Institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plan for use by 10th-grade science teachers for classroom discussions evolution, global warming, stem- cell research and cloning.Ohio School Board Members Are Considering New Assault On Teaching Of Evolution, Charges Americans United Americans United for Separation of Church and State, July 12, 2006 Grady's proposal was widely regarded as an attempt to circumvent the board's February 2006 vote to retract a controversial model lesson plan and to remove the indicator on which it was based from the standards; the indicator, which called for students to be able to \\"describe how scientists continue to investigate and critically analyze aspects of evolutionary theory,\\" was generally criticized as providing a pretext for instilling scientifically unwarranted doubts about evolution. Critics have noted that Grady's proposal will allow for the introduction of intelligent design in public schools, although the executive director of the Intelligent Design Network of Ohio, Roddy Bullock, says that the template would merely permit criticism of evolution, via a Teach the Controversy approach. However, in noting that the purpose of the template is to \\"open up these topics to different points of view, to different lines of evidence, to different interpretations of the evidence, to give students a more objective approach to science education,\\" and given that outside of creationism and intelligent design there are no alternatives to evolution, various groups such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State are in opposition to the proposal.WDC Media In fact, on July 11, Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed a request under the Ohio open records law asking for copies of the Grady proposal as well as all documents and correspondence by the Board of Education and the Department of Education relating to proposed changes to the state’s science standards. The group's executive director, Rev. Barry W. Lynn, urged the Ohio board to reject any effort to reopen the dispute over science education, noting \\"Public school students in Ohio deserve sound science education, not religious dogma masquerading as science. It’s time for Religious Right allies on the board to drop their unwise agenda and focus on policies that will benefit all of Ohio’s students.\\" =2007 Mississippi, House Bill 625= Representative Mike Lott (R-District 104) introduced House Bill 625 on January 9, 2007.

People with SCD have special challenges with the semantic aspect of language (the meaning of what is being said) and the pragmatics of language (using language appropriately in social situations). Social communication disorder has been formally recognized as a diagnosis since the DSM-5 was released in 2013.  Symptoms Individuals with social communication disorder have particular trouble understanding the meaning of what others are saying, and they are challenged in using language appropriately to get their needs met and interact with others. Children with the disorder often exhibit: * Delayed language development * Language disorders (similar to the acquired disorder of aphasia) such as word search pauses, jargoning, word order errors, word category errors, verb tense errors. * Stuttering or cluttering speech * Repeating words or phrases * Tendency to be concrete or prefer facts to stories * Difficulties with: Pronouns or pronoun reversal  Understanding questions  Understanding choices and making decisions  Following conversations or stories (conversations are \\"off-topic\\" or \\"one-sided\\")  Extracting the key points from a conversation or story; they tend to get lost in the details  Verb tenses  Explaining or describing an event  Understanding satire or jokes and contextual cues  Reading comprehension  Reading body language  Making and maintaining friendships and relationships because of delayed language development  Distinguishing offensive remarks  Organizational skills According to Bishop and Norbury (2002), children with semantic pragmatic disorder can have fluent, complex and clearly articulated expressive language but exhibit problems with the way their language is used. These children typically are verbose. However, they usually have problems understanding and producing connected discourse, instead giving conversational responses that are socially inappropriate, tangential and stereotyped. They often develop eccentric interests but not as strong or obsessional as people with autism spectrum disorders. The current view, therefore, is that the disorder has more to do with communication and information processing than language. For example, children with semantic pragmatic disorder will often fail to grasp the central meaning or saliency of events. This then leads to an excessive preference for routine and \\"sameness\\" (seen in autism spectrum disorders), as children with SCD struggle to generalize and grasp the meaning of situations that are new; it also means that more difficulties occur in a stimulating environment than in a one-to-one setting. A further problem caused by SCD is the assumption of literal communication. This would mean that obvious, concrete instructions are clearly understood and carried out, whereas simple but non-literal expressions such as jokes, sarcasm and general social chatting are difficult and can lead to misinterpretation. Lies are also a confusing concept to children with SCD as it involves knowing what the speaker is thinking, intending and truly meaning beyond a literal interpretation. Diagnostic  The DSM-5 categorizes SCD as a communication disorder within the domain of neurodevelopmental disorders, listed alongside other disorders of speech and language which typically manifest in early childhood. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for social communication disorder is as follows: > *A. Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal > communication as manifested by all of the following: # Deficits in using > communication for social purposes, such as greeting and sharing information, > in a manner that is appropriate for the social context. # Impairment of the > ability to change communication to match context or the needs of the > listener, such as speaking differently in a classroom than on a playground, > talking differently to a child than to an adult, and avoiding use of overly > formal language. # Difficulties following rules for conversation and > storytelling, such as taking turns in conversation, rephrasing when > misunderstood, and knowing how to use verbal and nonverbal signals to > regulate interaction. # Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly > stated (e.g., making inferences) and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of > language (e.g., idioms, humor, metaphors, multiple meanings that depend on > the context for interpretation). *B. The deficits result in functional > limitations in effective communication, social participation, social > relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance, > individually or in combination. *C. The onset of symptoms is in the early > developmental period (but deficits may not become fully manifested until > social communication demands exceed limited capacities). *D. The symptoms > are not attributable to another medical or neurological condition or to low > abilities in the domains of word structure and grammar, and are not better > explained by autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual > developmental disorder), global developmental delay, or another mental > disorder. Treatment Treatments for SCD are less established than for treatments for other disorders such as autism. Similarities between SCD and some aspects of autism leads some researchers to try some treatments for autism with people with SCD. Speech therapy can help individuals who have communication disorders. Speech and language therapy treatment focuses on communication and social interaction. Speech therapists can work with clients on communication in various settings. Similar or related disorders Hyperlexia is a similar but different disorder where main characteristics are an above-average ability to read with a below-average ability to understand spoken or written language. Joanne Volden wrote an article in 2002 comparing the linguistic weaknesses of children with nonverbal learning disability to PLI. =Differences between SCD and autism= Communication problems are also part of the autism spectrum disorder (autism); however, individuals with autism also show a restricted pattern of behavior, according to behavioral psychologists. The diagnosis of SCD can only be given if autism has been ruled out. It is assumed that those with autism have difficulty with the meaning of what is being said due to different ways of responding to social situations. Prior to the release of the DSM-5 in 2013, SCD was not differentiated from a diagnosis of autism. However, there were a large number of cases of children experiencing difficulties with pragmatics that did not meet the criteria for autism. The differential diagnosis of SCD allows practitioners to account for social and communication difficulties which occur to a lesser degree than in children with autism.Mash, Eric. (2016). Abnormal Child Psychology, 6e, 6th Edition. [VitalSource Bookshelf Online]. Retrieved fromhttps://cengagebrain.vitalsource.com/#/books/9781305445765/ Social communication disorder is distinguished from autism by the absence of any history (current or past) of restricted/repetitive patterns of interest or behavior in SCD.  History  In 1983, Rapin and Allen suggested the term \\"semantic pragmatic disorder\\" to describe the communicative behavior of children who presented traits such as pathological talkativeness, deficient access to vocabulary and discourse comprehension, atypical choice of terms and inappropriate conversational skills.Rapin I., and D. Allen (1983). \\"Developmental language disorders: Nosologic considerations\\", in U. Kirk (ed.), Neuropsychology of language, reading, and, spelling (pp. 155–184). Academic Press. They referred to a group of children who presented with mild autistic features and specific semantic pragmatic language problems. In the late 1990s, the term \\"pragmatic language impairment\\" (PLI) was proposed.Bishop, D. V. M. (2000), \\"Pragmatic language impairment: A correlate of SLI, a distinct subgroup, or part of the autistic continuum?\\" In D. V. M. Bishop and L. B. Leonard (eds.), Speech and Language Impairments in Children: Causes, characteristics, intervention and outcome (pp. 99–113). Hove, UK: Psychology Press. Rapin and Allen's definition has been expanded and refined by therapists who include communication disorders that involve difficulty in understanding the meaning of words, grammar, syntax, prosody, eye gaze, body language, gestures, or social context. While autistic children exhibit pragmatic language impairment, this type of communication disorder can also be found in individuals with other types of disorders including auditory processing disorders, neuropathies, encephalopathies and certain genetic disorders. Prior to the release of the DSM-5, there was debate over the relationship between semantic pragmatic disorder and autistic disorder, as the clinical profile of semantic pragmatic disorder is often seen in children with high-functioning autism.Bishop, D. V.M. and Norbury, C. F.

It lies on the Glenelg Highway between Hamilton and Ballarat, close to the Grampian mountain range. At the 2016 census, Glenthompson and the surrounding area had a population of 234. Its most notable landmark is the tall brickworks chimney that is also the symbol of what was the township's main industry for a period of time, as it provided bricks for regional buildings constructed in the post-war era. The brickworks is now closed but people can arrange a tour by appointment. History Originally, a small township named Yuppeckiar was built approximately five kilometres away, but it was moved to the present site of Glenthompson because of the construction of the railway linking Ballarat and Hamilton. The Post Office opened on November 1, 1866 as Glenthompson, was known for some months in 1872 as Yuppeckiar before reverting to Glenthompson. Pastoral settlement in the Glenthompson area began in 1848, and the subdivision of the land began in 1853. One of the resulting portions was the Glenronald property (which may be the source of the first part of the towns name, with the second part believed to have come from the name of a surveyor or local land owner). Glenthompson War Memorial Swimming Pool Nowadays it is a very quiet country town that serves as a minor transport and services hub for the surrounding farming district. Amenities Glenthompson is distinctive in that the town's hotel, Mac's Hotel, was built across the road from the railway station, some distance from the main road, unlike other country pubs in towns of a similar size, highlighting the importance of the railway in the town's development. This hotel burned down during the late 1800s on a different plot of land than the one that closed in 2013. The hotel that closed in 2013 was actually a private home, that was converted in the mid 20th century to a hotel long after its construction. Rose Cottage in McLennan Street was first built in 1850 and was used for business as a blacksmith, the local bakery, and the front room for dressmaking and alteration. In 1996 the residents got together and started a History Group known as Glenthompson Historical Group Inc. which operates a museum out of the former Glenthompson Railway Station. The History Centre is open to visit on Sundays from 12pm or by appointment. St Peter's Anglican Church in McLennan St (Caramut Road) had the story of St Peter produced as a mural around the internal walls of the church. Local artist Gareth Colliton from Warrnambool used local identities in place of the traditional faces to produce this modern variation. Well worth a look. The Church is open every day. Sport The town, in conjunction with nearby township Dunkeld, has an Australian Rules football team, Glenthompson-Dunkeld (AKA Rams), competing in the Mininera & District Football League (MDFL). In 2010, the team won the league Premiership. Prior to 2004, the Glenthompson Football Club (AKA Bloods) had competed in the MDFL for more than half a century. The club had secured senior premierships in 1969, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1983 and 1985. Over the history of the football club they have played in the now defunct Willaura and District Football Association (1921–27), Mount Rouse and Willaura District Football Association (1928), Western Football Association (1929), Hopkins Football Association (1930),Western and Hamilton Football Association (1931–33), Hamilton and District Football Association (1935–40) and the Dunkeld and District Football League (1945–47). In the past, the town has had a number of different sports including having its own 9 hole golf course. Most clubs have now closed. Former sports clubs include - Glenthompson Golf Club, Glenthompson Tennis Club, Glenthompson Basketball team (c. 1923), Glenthompson Cricket Club Education The first school was opened in 1868. This was rebuilt in 1902, featuring a steeped structure. In the same year, a Mechanics' Institute was opened. In 1998 the school amalgamated and became an outer campus of the Dunkeld Consolidated school. In 2011, with only one student still enrolled at this campus, a decision was made to close the campus. The children of the town now go either to Dunkeld or Lake Bolac for their Primary years. Secondary school is obtained in either Lake Bolac or Hamilton, with buses taking the children of the town and its surrounds.

WBXX took over the 104.9 frequency formerly occupied by WRCC-FM in September 2007; its former 95.3 spot on the dial was taken over by WBCK-FM, and WRCC's classic rock format was discontinued. As WBXX \\"B95\\", 95.3 FM was a very popular CHR/Top 40 station in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Despite the station's high ratings (especially with younger listeners), B95 was unsuccessful in terms of revenue because it played hip-hop and rap music that was unpopular with local advertisers. This led the station to change format to oldies and later adult contemporary, with which WBXX continued to broadcast initially after moving to 104.9. Logo used until December 2007. 104.9 was originally WALM-FM (sister station to the now-defunct WALM 1260 AM in Albion, Michigan) and later WELL-FM with a middle-of-the-road format. The station first used the WRCC call sign in 1996, broadcasting a satellite-fed country format known as \\"Cereal City Country\\" which was unable to compete with powerhouses WBCT and WNWN-FM and received low Arbitron ratings.

Eventually WWKN repositioned as \\"Super Hits 104-9\\" and then \\"Super Rock 104-9\\" (adjusting its format to classic hits) before changing to all-out classic rock as \\"Rock 104-9\\" and changing its calls back to WRCC. logo used from 2007-2016 Mix 104-9 featured the syndicated Delilah show Sunday through Friday nights and played classic hits during its \\"Wayback Weekends\\".

It was published in the June 1957 issue of Playboy magazine. It appeared in SF The Year's Greatest Science-Fiction and Fantasy, Dell First Edition B119, 1958. It was first filmed in 1958, and then again in 1986. An opera of the same name by Howard Shore premiered at the Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris, in 2008. The short story \\"The Fly\\" is included in Langelaan's short story collection Out of Time (1964). Plot The story begins late at night when François Delambre is awakened by the telephone. On the other end of the line is his sister-in-law Hélène who tells him that she has just killed his brother and that he should call the police. He does and they find the mangled remains of his brother in the family factory, his head and arm crushed under a hydraulic machine press. Hélène seems surprisingly calm throughout the investigation, willing to answer all questions except one: she will not give the reason for killing him. Eventually she is sent to a mental asylum and François is given custody of his brother's young son, Henri. François goes to visit her often, but she never provides the explanation for the question that he most desperately wants to know. Then one day she inquires how long a housefly's life span is. Later that evening, he hears Henri mention something about a fly with a funny white head. Realizing that this might somehow hold a clue to the murder, François confronts her with the news that Henri spotted a strange fly, and Hélène becomes extremely agitated at this news. François threatens to go to the police and give them the information about the insect if she does not tell him what he wants to know. She relents and advises him to come back the next day, at which time he will receive his explanation. The next day she gives him a handwritten manuscript, and later that night he reads it. His brother, André Delambre, was a brilliant research scientist who had just found an amazing discovery. Using machines that he called disintegrator- reintegrators, André could instantaneously transfer matter from one location to another through space. He had two such machines in his basement, one being used as a transmitter pod, the other as a receiver. Hélène's manuscript reveals that at first André encountered several flukes, including an experiment in which he transmitted an ashtray that reintegrated in the receiver pod with the words \\"Made in Japan\\" on the back written backwards. He also tried transmitting the family cat, which disintegrated perfectly but then never reappeared. Eventually, however, he ironed out the mistakes and found that the invention worked perfectly. Then one day André tried the experiment on himself. Unbeknownst to him, a tiny housefly had entered the transmitter pod with him, and when he emerged from the receiver, his head and arm had been switched with that of the insect. André tells Hélène that his only hope of salvation is for her to find the fly, identifiable by the fact that its head is completely white, so that he can transmit himself with it again in the hopes of regaining his missing atoms. A search of the house proves fruitless, and in desperation Hélène begs him to go through once more in the hopes that the transformation might reverse itself. Not believing it will work, but wanting to humor her, he agrees and goes through. When he steps out of the receiver Hélène pulls off the cloth sack that he has been covering his head with, and she is greeted with a truly horrifying sight. Not only is his head now that of a fly, but some of the missing particles from the family cat were also mixed in with his scrambled anatomy during the last experiment. Now realizing that he has been transformed beyond all hope, André destroys the pods and all of the work in his lab and devises a way to commit suicide while at the same time hiding from the world what he had become. He shows Hélène how to operate the hydraulic press and then places himself under it. Obeying his last wish, Hélène pushes the button to lower the press and kills her husband. François goes to see Hélène the next day but receives heartbreaking news. Unable to live with her memories, she committed suicide by cyanide during the night. Later that evening François invites Inspector Charas, the policeman in charge of the case, over to his house for dinner. After finishing their meal, François allows him to read Hélène's manuscript. After reading it, Charas declares that Hélène must have been mad, and they both decide to destroy the \\"confession\\". But just as the story ends, François tells Charas that earlier that day he killed a fly and buried it at his brother's graveside. It was a fly with a white head. Reception The Jungian analyst Marie-Louise von Franz discusses the story in her lectures on \\"The Inferior Function\\", an aspect of the theory of psychological types.

Prisoner role In the early 1980s he played what is perhaps his best-known acting role, that of vicious and cold prison officer Jock Stewart in Prisoner. In the storyline, after being fired from the prison service Stewart admitted to prisoner Judy Bryant that he was the one responsible for murdering her lesbian lover, fellow prisoner Sharon Gilmour. This revelation brought to a close a murder-mystery storyline in the series but launched a long-running story-arc where Bryant repeatedly escaped from prison in a succession of attempts to exact her revenge on Stewart. Film and Television After this Dysart continued in guest-starring television roles in drama series and situation comedies, and appeared in many feature films. His films included The Man from Snowy River (1982), Bliss (1985), Garbo (1992), and Flynn (1996). Television roles of the 1990s included appearances in All Together Now, The Games, State Coroner, Blue Heelers, Something in the Air and Neighbours. He also provided the voice for Captain Griswald in Anthony Lucas' animated short film The Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morello (2005). Commercial advertisements In the 1990s he appeared in a well- remembered television commercial advertisement for the Yellow Pages where he calls a series of mechanics about his problematic Goggomobil. He was also known for playing a recurring character of a Mafia-boss like butcher in advertisements for Don Smallgoods. In the early 2000s he continued his Goggomobil persona advertising Shannons Insurance. The concept played on the role of a person searching for the car parts as any car enthusiast would. Telstra challenged this in the Supreme Court and Shannons withdrew the advertisements, but continued with Dysart and the accent (which Dysart insisted was his own and could not change). The adverts continue and Shannons Insurance also owns several of the Goggomobil cars which feature regularly in their shows. Personal life  Tommy has enjoyed a long friendship and working relationship with director/writer Frank Howson in the movies Backstage, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, What the Moon Saw, Flynn, Crime Time, The Final Stage, The Lucky Country, and their most recent collaboration is the award-winning short film Remembering Nigel, which also stars Tommy's wife Joan and son Kole.

In operation after the creation of publicly funded Amtrak, the Rio Grande Zephyr was the last privately operated interstate passenger train in the United States. History The train was a remnant of the original California Zephyr, which was jointly operated by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, and Western Pacific Railroad. This iteration of the Zephyr ended operations on March 22, 1970, when the Western Pacific discontinued its portion. The Rio Grande Zephyr commenced operation using the D&RGW;'s portion of the California Zephyr route from Denver, Colorado to Salt Lake City, Utah. The route was extended to Ogden, Utah to allow for California-bound passengers to connect to the City of San Francisco and later the San Francisco Zephyr, which did not serve Salt Lake City. The Rio Grande Zephyr used mostly the same equipment and staff as was formerly used for the California Zephyr. Since the train was no longer an overnight affair, sleeping cars and a full baggage car were not required. The D&RGW; sold their sleepers to the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México, while their one baggage car was sold to the Algoma Central Railway in Canada. Amtrak planned to resume operation of the original California Zephyr on May 1, 1971. The D&RGW; and Amtrak could not come to terms over a contract agreement, however, and, just four days before Amtrak began operations, Union Pacific's Overland Route was substituted for the Rio Grande's Moffat Tunnel Route. The Amtrak service was initially named the San Francisco Zephyr, as the route combined portions of the routes of the former California Zephyr and the City of San Francisco trains. Rio Grande Zephyr in Glenwood Canyon, 1975 For twelve years, the Rio Grande Zephyr operated three days a week in each direction. It never operated on Wednesday. In 1983, the D&RGW; reversed its earlier opposition and elected to join Amtrak, citing increasing losses in passenger operations. Amtrak re- routed the San Francisco Zephyr over the D&RGW;'s main line between Denver and Salt Lake City, Utah, which had been the original preferred route in 1971. The change was initially scheduled for April 25, but a mudslide at Thistle, Utah closed the D&RGW;'s main line and delayed the change until July 16. While the Utah portion of the line was closed, The Rio Grande Zephyr continued to operate on a truncated route between Denver and Grand Junction, Colorado until the train was discontinued on April 24, 1983. After the D&RGW; tracks were re- opened, Amtrak revived the California Zephyr name. The modern California Zephyr uses the route of the Rio Grande Zephyr from Denver to Salt Lake City; service to Ogden was discontinued. Intercity rail service between Salt Lake City and Ogden was still available via the Desert Wind and Pioneer passenger trains, until these were discontinued in 1997. Passenger rail service between Ogden and Salt Lake City was restored in April 2008 with the startup of FrontRunner commuter trains. Equipment used Silver Sky on one of the last Rio Grande Zephyr runs in 1983 The equipment used when the Rio Grande Zephyr began service was as follows: * EMD F9 locomotives (A-B or A-B-B) * Steam generator car rebuilt from an ALCo PB1 * Combine 1230 or 1231 * Coach - Silver Aspen * Coach - Silver Pine * Vista-Dome Coach - Silver Bronco * Vista-Dome chair car - Silver Pony * Vista-Dome chair car - Silver Colt * Vista-Dome chair car - Silver Mustang * Vista-Dome dormitory-buffet-lounge car - Silver Shop * Diner (48 seats) - Silver Banquet * Vista-Dome buffet-lounge- observation - Silver Sky The combine, dome coach(es), dome lounge or diner, and dome-lounge-observation were always in the consist. The size and configuration of the train varied daily based on the number of tickets sold. All cars carried the prefix Silver in their name, a hold over from their days in California Zephyr service. Silver Aspen and Silver Pine were rebuilt in 1962–1963 from 16-section sleeping cars. After the train was discontinued, several Silver cars were transferred to Amtrak, as other railroads had done at Amtrak's inception. However, by this time Amtrak was moving to retire its older, inherited railcars. These cars are referred to as its Heritage Fleet. As a result, the ex-Rio Grande Zephyr cars were never used in regular revenue service for Amtrak. The cars sent to Amtrak were dome coaches Silver Colt, Silver Mustang and Silver Pony, flat-top coaches Silver Aspen and Silver Pine, and dining car Silver Banquet. Unfortunately, due to a center sill crack in Silver Banquets frame, the car was soon scrapped. In 1987, dome-buffet-dorm Silver Shop and dome-observation Silver Sky were traded to Via Rail Canada as part of a deal to re-equip the Rio Grande Ski Train with ex-Via Tempo cars. They were never operated by VIA. Silver Sky was sold in 2004 and Silver Shop was sold in 2006. Silver Sky is being renovated in Saginaw, Michigan by Bill Harman. Dome-coach Silver Bronco was retained by the D&RGW;, subsequently becoming the property of the railroad's parent company Ansco. In 2006, the Silver Bronco was sold by Ansco, becoming the last car built for the California Zephyr to pass into private ownership after spending all of its 58 years with the Rio Grande.

Vassall, a civil servant working in the Admiralty, had been revealed the previous year to be a Soviet spy, and considerable criticism had been levelled at the security arrangements that were in place. The tribunal was established to investigate the claims and determine whether any blame could be laid on officials or ministers. At first, the inquiry was to be conducted by three senior civil servants: the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Treasury, the Treasury Solicitor, and the Second Secretary at the Treasury. Before it could begin, letters were discovered in Vassall's possession from Tam Galbraith, who had been Civil Lord of the Admiralty. Vassall had been Galbraith's junior private secretary, but some people suggested that it was odd that a minister would communicate by post with an official of his own department, and there was considerable speculation of impropriety in the press. Given Vassall's homosexuality, which had become known, it began to be put around that he and Galbraith were involved with each other and that Galbraith might have shielded him from discovery. The committee of civil servants investigated the correspondence and declared it innocent, but the verdict was not universally accepted. Eventually, the Prime Minister was compelled to open a wider inquiry, conducted by three jurists. The inquiry determined that Vassall had not been helped or favoured by any of his seniors. The inquiry was controversial in some quarters for requiring journalists to reveal the sources that they claimed for their allegations and for having prosecuted two journalists, Brendan Mulholland of the Daily Mail and Reg Foster of the Daily Sketch, who refused and were jailed for contempt of court, Lord Radcliffe sentencing Mulholland for six months and Foster for three months.Wilson, John.

It was produced by Walt Disney Productions during an era that focused on releasing strongly adult-oriented films, including The Devil and Max Devlin, Tex, Night Crossing, Never Cry Wolf, Something Wicked This Way Comes, The Watcher in the Woods, and the international distribution of Dragonslayer. Because of the film's limited promotion and mostly negative reviews, Trenchcoat is among the most forgotten Disney films and is one of the most difficult to find.  Synopsis  The aspiring mystery writer Mickey Raymond (Margot Kidder) travels to Malta to research her first novel and falls in love with a handsome, mysterious American (Robert Hays). She is drawn into a conspiracy both fuelled by her vivid imagination and real-world drama. David Suchet plays a local police official who seemingly is one step behind events. Raymond's odd luck leads her to become embroiled in an international plutonium smuggling ring and comedic chaos ensues. Because of this, she becomes tired of being the victim and she begins to investigate herself what makes her unlucky. At the same time, a couple of two elderly people who met Mickey at their hotel see her a couple of times before she finds out the real culprits of the whole mess. At the end, Terry and Mickey stay together and they share a kiss in the dark.  Cast  * Margot Kidder as Mickey Raymond, the writer * Robert Hays as Terry Leonard, the spy * Gila von Weitershausen as Eva Werner * Daniel Faraldo as Nino Tenucci, Mickey's taxi driver * Ronald Lacey as Princess Aida * John Justin as Marquis De Pena * Leopoldo Trieste as Esteban Ortega * Jennifer Darling as Laurie * Kevork Malikyan as the Arab who kidnaps Mickey * Vic Tablian as Achmed  Release  The film was produced by Walt Disney Productions but not promoted as such, due to its adult themes (though Disney promoted in the Japanese and Germany VHS releases). Trenchcoat, Never Cry Wolf, and Dragonslayer are widely regarded as the films that led to the launch of Touchstone Pictures on February 15, 1984. The film was released on March 11, 1983 at movie theatres. It was released by Walt Disney Home Video on VHS and Betamax in 1983 and was released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on DVD on January 31, 2012. As of March 22, 2011, Trenchcoat was available on iTunes and Amazon.com for digital rental, with the Walt Disney logo being attached to the film for the first time since its theatrical release. Otherwise, the movie is hard to find because of its lack of promotion. Unlike some other 1980s films such as The Journey of Natty Gann, Condorman and Something Wicked This Way Comes, Trenchcoat doesn't have a soundtrack that has been released yet by Intrada Records.  Reception  The film was a box office failure, earning only a total of $4,304,286 domestically. The film has been received negatively.

Administrative parts Town parts of Košumberk and Zdislav and villages of Bělá, Brdo, Dobrkov, Doly, Domanice, Rabouň, Radim, Srbce and Voletice are administrative parts of Luže. Geography Luže is located on the right bank of the river Novohradka. It lies between the woody hills of the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands and the plentiful Elbe lowlands. History Luže was formed in 1250 when Kamenicza joined with the newly formed town of Luza. The history of the town is closely linked with the Košumberk Castle. At the end of the Middle Ages, Luže was part of the manor of lords of Chlum and Košumberk, later Slavatas from Chlum and Košumberk. After the establishment of Czechoslovakia, Luže became a spa town. The Hamza sanatorium in Luže was founded in 1901 by professor František Hamza, M.D. It was the first sanatorium in Central Europe for children suffering from tuberculosis. In 1962 the treatment of tuberculosis patients stopped and Luže focused upon the rehabilitation of patients with mobility impairments. The present-day town Luže attracts tourists to its many monuments and beautiful nature in peaceful countryside. Sights =Košumberk Castle= Košumberk Castle was established by the noble family Slavata of Chlum. In the 17th century, the local branch of the family died out. The manor was inherited by the wife of Slavata, the Countess Hieserle. In 1690, the property was donated to the Jesuits. They managed the castle until the abolition of the Jesuit friary. The last owner of this estate was a Bavarian family of Thurn und Taxis, who owned the estate until the establishment of an independent republic. In 1922 \\"Družstvo na záchranu hradu Košumberka\\" was the team that retrieved Košumberk. Nowadays Košumberk is the property of the town of Luže. There is an historical exhibition of the castle and town. =Pilgrimage Church of the Virgin Mary on Chlumek= The Pilgrimage Church of the Virgin Mary on Chlumek was founded by Countess Mary Maximiliana of Žďár. She built the church at her own expense. On 8 May 1668 Bishop Matouš Ferdinand Sobek dedicated the foundation stone, and on 9 August 1669 an expensive Baroque church was consecrated to the Virgin Mary. The church complex has a typical rectangular floor plan. The main aisle is demarcated by a balustrade interspersed by four larger and four smaller chapels. The building's construction and the architectural motifs are very precise. A unique set of artistic decorations adorns the building as well. Created around 1700, some of the works it contains are undoubtedly of gallery quality. =St. Bartholomew's Church= Originally a Gothic Church of St. Bartholomew first mentioned in historical records in 1381, St. Bartholomew's Church has been renovated several times. Part of the aisle has maintained the Gothic style. Within the church are some tombstones such as the tombstone of Diviš Slavata from Chlum and Košumberk. =The Synagogue and Jewish cemetery= On the South East side of town lies a district which was inhabited by a Jewish community. Since the late 18th century, the city had a Rabbi. Dwellers (309 persons in 1920) were almost exterminated during the World War II. The Synagogue building from the 18th century has been renewed. A large Jewish cemetery about 1 km north of Luže has graves dating back to the 17th century.

It is a colourless solid that is related to the better known EDTA. Compared to EDTA, it has a lower affinity for magnesium, making it more selective for calcium ions. It is useful in buffer solutions that resemble the environment in living cells where calcium ions are usually at least a thousandfold less concentrated than magnesium. The pKa for binding of calcium ions by tetrabasic EGTA is 11.00, but the protonated forms do not significantly contribute to binding, so at pH 7, the apparent pKa becomes 6.91. See Qin et al. for an example of a pKa calculation. EGTA has also been used experimentally for the treatment of animals with cerium poisoning and for the separation of thorium from the mineral monazite. EGTA is used as a compound in elution buffer in the protein purification technique known as tandem affinity purification, in which recombinant fusion proteins are bound to calmodulin beads and eluted out by adding EGTA.

John Randolph Tucker, a Democrat from Virginia, sponsored the Tucker Act. The Tucker Act (March 3, 1887, ch. 359, , ) is a federal statute of the United States by which the United States government has waived its sovereign immunity with respect to certain lawsuits. The Tucker Act may be divided into the \\"Big\\" Tucker Act, which applies to claims above $10,000 and gives jurisdiction to the United States Court of Federal Claims, and the \\"Little\\" Tucker Act (), the current version of which gives concurrent jurisdiction to the Court of Federal Claims and the District Courts \\"for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the internal-revenue laws\\", and for claims below $10,000. Permitted lawsuits Suits may arise out of express or implied contracts to which the government was a party. Damages may be liquidated or unliquidated. Suits may be brought for Constitutional claims, particularly taking of property by the government to be compensated under the Fifth Amendment. Parties may bring suit for a refund of taxes paid. Explicitly excluded are suits in which a claim is based on a tort by the government. The Tucker Act granted jurisdiction to the Court of Claims over government contract money claims both for breach, and for relief under the contracts in the form of equitable adjustment. As an alternative to proceeding directly against the United States pursuant to the Tucker Act, the Supreme Court, in Burr v. FHA,Burr v. FHA, has stated that Congress may organize \\"sue and be sued\\" agencies; such agencies may be sued in any court of otherwise competent jurisdiction as if it were a private litigant, as long as the agency is to pay out the judgment from its own budget, not from the U.S. Treasury. Whether the agency or the Treasury is to pay depends on the congressional intent. The Tucker Act in itself does not create any substantive rights, but must be paired with a \\"money mandating\\" statute that allows for the payment of money, per the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Testan.United States v. Testan, =Wunderlich Act= In United States v. Wunderlich (1951), the Supreme Court held that procurement agencies could preclude judicial review of their decisions relating to contract disputes (except as to fraud issues) by exacting the contractor's acquiescence in contract clauses making agency board's decisions final both as to fact and law. This result was not deemed desirable by Congress, which enacted the Wunderlich Act to overturn that decision. Under the terms of this Act, board decisions could be accorded no finality on questions of law, but findings could be made final as to fact issues so far as supported by substantial evidence and not arbitrary or capricious, etc., and thus the statute restored a significant role to the Court of Claims. Under the Wunderlich Act, the Court of Claims at first received testimony additional to that in the board record, determining whether board findings were supported by substantial evidence by weighing the findings against both record testimony and that newly taken. In United States v. Carlo Bianchi & Co.United States v. Bianchi & Co. in 1963, the Supreme Court construed the Wunderlich Act to restrict the Court of Claims to a purely appellate function in disputes clause cases. The court could remand to the board for further testimony, if needed, but could not take any itself, nor make any fact findings. The Court of Claims at that period, besides the Article III judges, included several persons called \\"commissioners\\" in the rules; later they were called \\"trial judges\\" and, collectively, the court's \\"trial division\\". The Bianchi decision appeared to eliminate any function for these commissioners to perform as to most contract disputes clause cases, for they were primarily takers of testimony and fact finders. However, the judges, having found the commissioners' services of value, were reluctant to dispense with them, and a way to utilize them was found. The rules were amended for Wunderlich cases only, Ct. Cl. Rule 163(b),Rules of the United States Court of Claims, 1969 ed., p. 93 to provide that in such cases both parties should file motions for summary judgment, which motions were referred to commissioners for advisory or recommended opinions. That there was no fact issue requiring trial was a conclusion forced by Bianchi. The commissioners usually reviewed the records, received briefs, and heard oral arguments. In other than Wunderlich cases, cross-motions for summary judgment went before the Article III judges with no participation by the commissioners. In Wunderlich cases, the recommended opinion of the commissioner was, unless acquiesced in by both parties, considered on exceptions, oral arguments, and new briefs by the Article III judges. History The Act was named after Congressman John Randolph Tucker, of Virginia, who introduced it as a substitute for four other competing measures on government claims being considered by the House Judiciary Committee.

Tooth development or odontogenesis is the process in which teeth develop and grow into the mouth. Tooth development varies among species.  Tooth development in vertebrates  =Fish= In fish, Hox gene expression regulates mechanisms for tooth initiation. However, sharks continuously produce new teeth throughout their livesDave Abbott, Sharks, found here via a drastically different mechanism. Shark teeth form from modified scales near the tongue and move outward on the jaw in rows until they are eventually dislodged.Michael E. Williams, Jaws: The early years, found here . Their scales, called dermal denticles, and teeth are homologous organs. =Mammals= Generally, tooth development in non-human mammals is similar to human tooth development. The variations usually lie in the morphology, number, development timeline, and types of teeth.Frandson and Spurgeon, Anatomy and Physiology of Farm Animals., p. 305. However, some mammals' teeth do develop differently than humans'. In mice, WNT signals are required for the initiation of tooth development. Rodents' teeth continually grow, forcing them to wear down their teeth by gnawing on various materials.Caceci. Veterinary Histology with subtitle \\"Digestive System: Oral Cavity\\" found here . If rodents are prevented from gnawing, their teeth eventually puncture the roofs of their mouths. In addition, rodent incisors consist of two halves, known as the crown and root analogues. The labial half is made of enamel and resembles a crown, while the lingual half is made of dentin and resembles a root. The mineral distribution in rodent enamel is different from that of monkeys, dogs, pigs, and humans. In horse teeth, enamel and dentin layers are intertwined, which increases the strength and decreases the wear rate of the teeth.Jake Andersen, DMD, TeethEncarta Contrary to popular belief, horse teeth do not \\"grow\\" indefinitely. Rather, existing tooth erupts from below the gumline. Horses start to \\"run out\\" of erupting tooth in their early 30s and in the rare case they live long enough, the roots of their teeth will fall out completely in the middle to latter part of their third decade. In manatees, mandibular molars develop separately from the jaw and are encased in a bony shell separated by soft tissue. This also occurs in elephants' successional teeth, which erupt to replace worn teeth. Elephants have six sets of molars in their life, all of which grown from the back of their mouth and are then pushed forward. All members of the order Tubulidentata have no incisors or canines, their teeth have no enamel, and their molars grow continuously from the root.\\"Class Mammalia, Order Tubulidentata, Family Orycteropodidae, Species Orycteropus afer,\\" University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. Page accessed November 16, 2009.  Invertebrate \\"teeth\\"  True teeth are unique to vertebrates, although some invertebrates have analogous structures sometimes called \\"teeth\\". The organism with the simplest genome bearing such \\"teeth\\" is probably the worm genus Ancylostoma (Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus). Molluscs have a structure called a radula which bears a ribbon of chitinous \\"teeth\\". However, these are histologically and developmentally different from vertebrate teeth, and are unlikely to be homologous. For example, vertebrate teeth develop from a neural crest mesenchyme-derived dental papilla, and the neural crest is specific to vertebrates, as are tissues such as enamel.

He put the first computer on the ARPANET outside of the US and was instrumental in defining and implementing TCP/IP alongside Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. He is \\"often recognized as the father of the European Internet\\". Life and career Kirstein was born on 20 June 1933 in Berlin, Germany, the son of Eleanor (Jacobsohn) and Walter Kirschstein. His parents were dentists, and his father was awarded the Iron Cross during WWI. His family was Jewish and his mother had British citizenship from being born in London, so, fearing for their safety in Nazi-governed- Germany the family immigrated to the UK in 1937. He was educated at Highgate School in North London,Highgate School Register 7th Edn 1833–1988, Ed. Patrick Hughes & Ian F Davies 1989 received a B.A. from Cambridge University in 1954, an MSc and PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford University (in 1955 and 1957, respectively) and a D.Sc. in engineering from the University of London in 1970. He was a member of the staff at CERN from 1959 to 1963. He did research for General Electric at Zurich from 1963 to 1967. He was a professor at the University of London Institute of Computer Science (ICS) from 1970 to 1973. After that, he joined the faculty at the University College London in 1973, serving as head of the computer science department from 1980 to 1994. He supervised Jon Crowcroft. It is believed that Kirstein set up Queen Elizabeth's first official email account in 1976.  Internet development  Kirstein's research group at University College London was one of the two original international connections on the ARPANET in 1973, alongside Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR) which connected via Sweden's satellite station in Tanum. Research led by Bob Kahn at DARPA and Vint Cerf at Stanford University and later DARPA resulted in the formulation of the Transmission Control Program (TCP), with its specification written by Cerf with Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine in December 1974. The following year, testing began through concurrent implementations at Stanford, BBN and University College London. This later grew into the trans-Atlantic SATNET. In 1978, early in the development of the Internet, he co-authored (with Vint Cerf) one of the most significant early technical papers on the internetworking concept. His research group at UCL adopted TCP/IP in 1982, a year ahead of ARPANET, and played a significant role in the very earliest experimental Internet work.  Awards  He was awarded the CBE for his work on the Internet. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, an Honorary Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society. He received the SIGCOMM Award in 1999 for \\"contributions to the practical understanding of large-scale networks through the deployment of international testbeds\\", and the Postel Award in 2003, as well as various other awards for his contributions to the development of the Internet internationally. In 2012, Kirstein was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.2012 Inductees, Internet Hall of Fame website. Retrieved 24 April 2012 In 2015, he was awarded the prestigious Marconi Prize.  Later life  Peter Kirstein died from a brain tumour on the morning of 8 January 2020 while in his home. Shortly after his death, Professor Steve Hailes, Head of Department for UCL Computer Science, wrote about him: \\"Peter was very widely recognised as a pioneer of the Internet and has many honours to his name [...] Much of this was undoubtedly down to an incredibly logical mind, coupled with a level of interest, vision and determination that saw him retire only late last year at the age of 86.

Until 2007, the magazine was published by Forbes.Grosvenor, Edwin S. \\"Editor's Letter,\\" American Heritage, Winter 2008. Since that time, Edwin S. Grosvenor has been its editor and publisher. Print publication was suspended early in 2013,\\"American Heritage Magazine Temporarily Suspends Publication,\\" History News Network, May 2, 2013. but the magazine relaunched in digital format with the Summer 2017 issue after a Kickstarter campaign raised $31,203 from 587 backers.AmericanHeritage.com The 70th Anniversary issue of the magazine (Winter 2020) on the subject \\"What Makes America Great?\\" includes essays by such historians as Fergus Bordewich, Douglas Brinkley, Joseph Ellis, and David S. Reynolds. History American Heritage was first published in 1947 by the American Association for State and Local History. From 1947 to 1949 the American Association for State and Local History published a house organ, American Heritage: A Journal of Community History. In September 1949, AASLH launched the magazine with broader scope for the general public, but keeping certain features geared to educators and historical societies. In 1954, AASLH sold the magazine to a quartet of writers and editors from Time, Inc. including James Parton, Oliver Jensen, Joseph J. Thorndike and founding editor Bruce Catton, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of the Civil War. They formed the American Heritage Publishing Company and introduced the hardcover, 120-page advertising-free \\"magazine\\" with Volume 6, Number 1 in December 1954. Though, in essence, an entirely new magazine, the publishers kept the volume numbering because the previous incarnation had been indexed in the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature. Each year begins in December and continues through the following October, published every other month. For example, Volume XXV issues are December 1973, February 1974, April 1974, June 1974, August 1974, and October 1974. December 1974 begins Volume XXVI. Bruce Catton remained with the magazine for 25 years until his death in 1979 and published over 100 essays. He warned historians against \\"regarding the past so fondly we are unable to get it in proper focus, and we see virtues that were not there.” In 1964, David McCullough began his writing career as an editor and writer for American Heritage, which he sometimes calls \\"my graduate school\\". McCullough wrote numerous articles for the magazine.Brief biography and list of American Heritage articles by David McCullough. He turned his article for the June 1966 issue on the Johnstown Flood, Run for Your Lives,http://www.americanheritage.com/content/run-your- lives into a full-length book titled, The Johnstown Flood. When it became an unexpected bestseller, McCullough left the magazine in 1968 to commit full- time to writing. Later American Heritage articles by McCullough on the transcontinental railroad and Harry Truman also became bestselling books. By 1980, costs made the hardcover version prohibitive for a regular subscription. Subscribers could choose the new regular newsstand high-quality softcover or the \\"Collector's Edition\\", even plusher and thicker than the previous hardcover. Each is usually about 80 pages and has more \\"relevant\\" features and shorter articles than in the early years, but the scope and direction and purpose had not changed. Forbes bought the magazine in 1986. On May 17, 2007, the magazine, published on a bimonthly basis, announced that it had stopped publication, at least temporarily, with the April/May 2007 issue.\\" On October 27, 2007, Edwin S. Grosvenor, purchased the magazine from Forbes for $500,000 in cash and $10 million in subscription liabilities. Grosvenor, who serves as president and editor-in-chief, is the former editor of the fine arts magazine, Portfolio. Grosvenor was also the editor of the literary magazine, Current Books, and magazines for Marriott and Hyatt Hotels. He was also the CEO of KnowledgeMax, Inc., an online bookseller. After suspending print publication in 2013, the magazine relaunched digitally in 2017 with a new website and subscriber management system.  Contents  For a magazine that has lasted seven decades, its way of covering history has changed much over the years. Each issue is still an eclectic collection of articles on the people, places, and events from the entire history of the United States. Today, there is mention of television shows and Web sites, and a greater diversity of articles such as Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates' recent article, \\"Growing Up Colored,\\" about life as a young boy in segregated West Virginia. Recent content has included a special 70th Anniversary issue on \\"What Makes America Great\\" (Winter 2020) and an issue on the history of gun control with essays by historian Joseph J. Ellis, law professor Adam Winkler, and gun rights advocate Robert A. Levy. Some historians have criticized the magazine for what they say is a lack of seriousness. Reviewing David McCullough's book on John Adams in The New Republic, Sean Wilentz stated that during the 1950s, \\"[Bernard] DeVoto's style of seriousness [was] eclipsed by the more journalistic and sentimentally descriptive style of American Heritage, whose influence is everywhere.\\" Wilentz claimed that McCullough and film maker Ken Burns followed the American Heritage style: \\"popular history as passive nostalgic spectacle\\" marching \\"under the banner of 'narrative'\\". The magazine's editor at the time, Richard Snow, replied that \\"this magazine has never taken an overly sentimentalized or simplistic view of the past\\" and that American Heritage is \\"a magazine addressed to a lay audience and thus it has the usual fixtures—columns, picture stories, and so forth—and a variety of topics, some of greater consequence than others... but that it publishes many historians \\"whose work nobody has ever called simplistic, or sentimental, or undemanding. Numerous articles in American Heritage have later been expanded into bestselling books, including: * Barbara W. Tuchman's three-part series on Gen. Stillwell in 1970, beginning with \\"A Yankee Among The War Lords\\", that was later published as Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45, which won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1972.Pulitzer Prizes for 1972 * Walter Lord's 1955 article \\"Maiden Voyage: The first and last trip of the 'unsinkable' Titanic\\", that became the bestselling A Night to Remember, which was made into a movie. * Laura Hillenbrand's 1998 article, \\"Four Good Legs Between Us\\", that became the 2001 book, Seabiscuit: An American Legend and the 2003 film, Seabiscuit, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In addition to running four to six articles, American Heritage's regular features include * \\"History News\\" - news and happenings in museums, historic sites, movies * \\"Heritage Travel\\" - guides to what to see in historic American areas * \\"Now on the Web\\" - what's being written relating to history around the Web * \\"Letters to the Editor\\" - readers' letters * \\"My Brush With History\\" - readers' own stories about incidents in their lives that have some interesting historical significance During the early 1960s, American Heritage sponsored a series of popular military board games produced by the Milton Bradley Company.

When Bowater's constructed a pulp and paper mill in Corner Brook in the mid-1920s, Ballam moved there to be close to his former home in Curling. In 1940, his career changed when he became a representative for Sun Life Assurance Company. Ballam, elected president of Local 64 of the Pulp and Sulphite Workers Union in Corner Brook in 1935, had also attended the founding convention of the Newfoundland Federation of Labour in 1937. In 1939, he relinquished his leadership role with Local 64 to become president of the new federation, a position he held until the following year when he left the Corner Brook mill to enter the insurance business. Ballam decided to offer himself for one of the two delegate positions assigned to Humber district at the National Convention, that was set up by the British government on December 11, 1945 to determine the political fate of Newfoundland and Labrador. He had won the position with 1,624 votes, second to Pierce Fudge, another well-known and popular labour leader. At the convention, Smallwood felt he could count on Ballam for support for the motion he planned to introduce early in the convention calling for a delegation to Ottawa to discuss potential terms of union between Canada and Newfoundland. Ballam, in his speech to the convention on Smallwood's resolution, clearly states that he is :not a Confederate and not supporting any particular form of government; but in the interests of the whole country I would like to see something definite done on this question once and for all. Even though Smallwood failed in his first attempt to have such a delegation appointed, he was successful later in the convention. Ballam voted in favour of both resolutions, and was elected as one of the delegates to go to Ottawa to explore terms in June 1947. The delegation's report, tabled at the Convention in November, was rejected by a majority of its members. Confederation did eventually make it as one of the ballot options presented to the people of Newfoundland in a referendum held on June 3, 1948. By then, Ballam was a committed Confederate. He was one of the leading campaigners for the Confederate forces in Corner Brook and the surrounding area for that referendum and for a second referendum held on July 22. Ballam was selected by Joseph R. Smallwood, the interim premier, to be a part of his cabinet when it was sworn into office on March 31, 1949. That cabinet held office until the first post-Confederate House of Assembly was elected on May 27, 1949, after which a new cabinet was sworn in from the elected MHAs. Ballam won his seat and once again was given the portfolio the Department of Labour. He held that portfolio for the next 17 years. Re-elected in the district of Humber in 1951 and, following redistribution, of Humber West in 1956, 1959 and 1962, in 1966 he announced his retirement from politics, following which he was appointed a member of the board of the Newfoundland and Labrador Power Commission. He died on December 12, 1981. Ballam and his wife E. Maria Bagg established a scholarship in memory of their son Ulric, who was killed in an accident at the Corner Brook pulp and paper mill on July 27, 1945, at the age of 17, to be awarded annually to a term 2 engineering student at Memorial University of Newfoundland.

It was used as a port for slave ships and cotton ships but its importance declined as other ports such as Lancaster were opened up. Sunderland is unique in the United Kingdom as being the only community to be on the mainland and yet dependent upon tidal access. The only vehicular access to the village is via a single-track road from Overton away crossing a tidal marsh. The road is covered by water at every high tide. Among other effects, this results in the children of Sunderland sometimes being required to arrive late at school in Overton or to leave early to avoid being cut off by the tide. Strictly speaking, \\"Sunderland Point\\" is the name of the tip of the peninsula on which the village of Sunderland stands, but the name is frequently applied to the village itself.  History  It was developed as an out port for Lancaster by Robert Lawson, a Quaker, at the beginning of the 18th century. Reportedly, stonework from the ruined Cockersand Abbey just across the river was utilised in the construction of the quay and buildings. Lawson finally went bankrupt in 1728, which began a steady decline until it was totally surpassed by Glasson Dock, which opened in 1787. Ships could unload here, or wait for the tide before moving up to the main docks at St. George's Quay in Lancaster and registering at the Customs House. Sailors were known to press- gang new recruits at the Three Mariners public house, just off the quay in Lancaster, and at the Golden Ball on the way back along the river at Snatchems. Both public houses can still be visited. Fit young candidates were often plied with copious amounts of alcohol, before being whisked away for an extended service at sea. Another local place called Catchems must also have been involved in the press-ganging, which was rife in the locality. Many a young man disappeared from the farms and villages around the marshes. = Sambo's Grave = The Port of Lancaster, once the third largest in the country, was part of the slavery triangle. The master of a slave or servant called Sambo left him at Sunderland Point whilst he travelled on to Lancaster to undertake his business in the rest of Britain. Sambo died in 1736 in the old brewery, which still stands on the corner of the pathway that leads to his grave. Sambo's Grave on the unconsecrated (as he was not a Christian) and windswept shoreline of Morecambe Bay is still a local tourist attraction today. The grave almost always bears flowers or stones painted by local children.  Today  Along the quay at Sunderland Point are a number of fine late 17th century and Georgian dwellings which are well protected against the weather, one of which is a former hostelry.Villages by the Sea: Sunderland Point, BBC2, 2 April 2020. There is also a fine early-18th-century gatepier on the quay that Pevsner thought worthy of note. There are stunning views over the River Lune and the hamlet was featured in the TV drama The Ruby in the Smoke with Billie Piper and Julie Walters in December 2006. Many properties at Sunderland Point suffer regular flooding, with individual properties made resilient to the effects.

After completing his education, he managed the general store at a railway construction camp in Leonard, Ontario.Henry Black fonds Saskatchewan Archival Information Network. Retrieved 26 August 2015. In 1899 he moved to Kaslo, British Columbia, a mining town, where he operated a lumber, coal, and shipping business. He arrived in Regina in 1903 and became a contractor and real estate speculator, benefiting from the fledgling city's construction boom. At first in partnership with Archibald McGregor, and then independently, he built department stores, schools, farmer markets and apartment blocks. In 1910 he married Jennie Barker, and they had five children together. Black's first son, Henry Kenneth \\"Ken\\" Black, went on to become a prominent Regina architect. In 1917 with a group of local investors, Black established the Prairie Biscuit and Confectionery Company, a wholesale baking enterprise, but the business couldn't withstand the sugar shortage imposed by the First World War and it ceased operations before the end of 1918. He served as a Regina alderman from 1915 to 1917, and was twice elected mayor, in 1918 and 1919. During Black’s first term as mayor, Saskatchewan was stricken by the influenza pandemic, and he had to ban all public gatherings in the city including church services. In his second term, he was credited with convincing Regina labour leaders not to participate in a general strike along the lines of the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike. Black unsuccessfully ran for the Conservatives against Premier William Martin in the 1921 provincial election. He again served as a Regina alderman from 1923 to 1924. In 1931, Black was asked by the government to assume chairmanship of the Saskatchewan Relief Commission. Coupled with the onset of the Depression, the failure of crops in a largely agricultural province was disastrous. In its first year alone, the Commission distributed relief to 305,000 people, close to one-third of Saskatchewan's population. It operated camps and dining halls for homeless men in Regina, Moose Jaw, and Saskatoon, using those places as bases to provide men with jobs on farms. The Commission managed the provincial government’s relief programs until August 1934, and Black oversaw the spending of $35 million ($525 million in 2005 dollars). In recognition of his voluntary work with the Relief Commission, he was made in 1935 a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by King George V. In 1937, at the age of 63, he once again ran for mayor of Regina, but was defeated. He continued to manage his business interests in Regina until his death in 1960.

Sahl b. Zādānfarrūḫ as-Saraḫsī, died 818), titled Dhu 'l-Ri'āsatayn (\\"the man of the two commands\\"), was a famous Persian vizier of the Abbasid era in Khurasan, who served under Caliph al- Ma'mun (r. 813–832). He played a crucial role in the civil war between al- Ma'mun and his brother al-Amin (r. 809–813), and was the de facto ruler of the Caliphate until 817. Family Fadl's father Sahl was a Zoroastrian from Kufa, who later converted to Islam and joined the Barmakids. At the urging of Barmakid Yahya ibn Khalid, Fadl also converted to Islam, probably in 806, and entered the service of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid and his son al- Ma'mun.Bosworth 1999 Fadl realized very early on that after Harun al-Rashid's death, his throne was disputed between his sons, and urged al-Ma'mun, the son of a Persian concubine, to accompany his father on his expedition to Khurasan, to secure a power-base in Iranian lands. When the arrived events as accurately as Fadl had predicted it, al-Ma'mun made him his chief adviser, and his right hand during the civil war with his brother al-Amin. Political career After defeating al-Amin, al-Ma'mun became the new Caliph throughout the eastern Islamic world, primarily the Iranian lands, and Fadl was appointed vizier and Emir of these areas. Because of his local role as civil and military leader he received the honorary title of ذو الرئاستين, meaning \\"the dual leadership of violence\\".Sourdel 1991 In addition, he was rewarded with immense riches and an inheritable estate. Fadl's brother, al-Hasan ibn Sahl was also appointed Minister of Finance. Even though he emerged victorious during the Fourth Fitna, al-Ma'mun continued to face several revolts and a considerable resistance from the Arab aristocracy, especially in Baghdad and Syria. According to the historian al-Azraqi and Ibn Babuya, Fadl led several campaigns in Khurasan and the neighboring areas, and there the local rulers faced decisive defeats, including the Karluk Turks (whose leaders had to flee) and the Kabul Shahi. The significance of this victory can hardly be underestimated, since Fadl not only secured the eastern flank of the empire, but also for the influx of new mercenaries and military slaves made for al- Ma'mun's army. A significant turning point in history of the Abbasid Caliphate was the nomination of a Shiite Imam named Ali al-Ridha as al-Ma'mun's successor. The appointment of Ali al-Ridha as his successor, the general pro- Shiite attitude of the Caliph and the fact that al-Ma'mun continued reside in the Merv, a prominent city populated by Persians, and not in the Arab heartland of the Caliphate in Iraq, allowed the enemies of the Caliph, he and his consultants were seen as Persophiles and branded as \\"anti-Arab\\". Fadl was accused of secretly a Shiite takeover of the caliphate and trying to restore the Sasanian Empire. According to the some sources, Fadl later rejected a large sum of money from the Caliph and resigned from his office to live a quiet and ascetic life. Death On 13 February 818, Fadl was mysteriously found dead in a bathroom in Sarakhs, in northern Khurasan. According to various reports, he was circa 41–60 years old when he died. According to some rumors, the caliph himself had ordered his assassination. Within a short time later Ali Al-Ridha was also murdered. Most modern historians agree that it was al-Ma'mun who ordered the death of both men, despite his deep friendship and solidarity to them (with whom he was related by marriage), politics and the unity of the caliphate. Fadl was seen as a dynamic, sometimes violent and authoritarian politician, but was not selfish or greedy.

It is capable of rendering painterly images from photographic negatives. Gum printing is traditionally a multi-layered printing process, but satisfactory results may be obtained from a single pass. Any color can be used for gum printing, so natural-color photographs are also possible by using this technique in layers. History and process overview A gum bichromate by Robert Demachy Gum bichromate, or gum dichromate as it is also known, is a photographic printing process invented in the early days of photography when, in 1839, Mungo Ponton discovered that dichromates are light sensitive. William Henry Fox Talbot later found that sensitized dichromated colloids such as gelatin and gum arabic became insoluble in water after exposure to sunlight. Alphonse Poitevin added carbon pigment to the colloids in 1855, creating the first carbon print. In 1858, John Pouncy used colored pigment with gum arabic to create the first color images. Gum prints tend to be multi-layered images sometimes combined with other alternative process printing methods such as cyanotype and platinotype. A heavy weight cotton watercolor or printmaking paper that can withstand repeated and extended soakings is best. Each layer of pigment is individually coated, registered, exposed and washed. Separation negatives of cyan, magenta, and yellow or red, green, and blue are used for a full-color image. Some photographers prefer substituting the cyan emulsion in the CMYK separations with a cyanotype layer. A simple duotone separation combining orange watercolor pigment and a cyanotype can yield surprisingly beautiful results. Low density photographic negatives of the same size as the final image are used for exposing the print. No enlarger is used, but instead, a contact printing frame or vacuum exposure frame is used with an ultraviolet light source such as a mercury vapor lamp, a common fluorescent black light, or the sun. The negative is sandwiched between the prepared paper and a sheet of glass in registration with previous passes. The print is then floated face down in a bath of room-temperature water to allow the soluble gum, excess dichromate, and pigment to wash away. Several changes of water bath are necessary to clear the print. Afterwards, the print is hung to dry. When all layers are complete and dry, a clearing bath of sodium metabisulfite is used to extract any remaining dichromate so the print will be archival.

Part B is a saturated solution of dichromate salt. Use only one of the three kinds of dichromate crystals. Mix the dichromate crystals with the 80mL of warm water until dissolved. Then add enough distilled water to make 100mL of solution. Store finished solution in a light-tight bottle. Keep away from food, children, pets, etc. = Stretching and sizing paper = Stretching (pre- shrinking) paper is necessary if you are printing more than one color or multiple times with the same color to build up density. If your paper is not sized (most watercolour papers are, though to varying degrees) it’s also advisable to size the paper to help minimize staining. A gelatin size (coating) prevents the unhardened dichromate from permeating the paper fibers. Without stretching, the paper will change shape between layer printings. Make lots of sized paper at one time. Label all paper with pencil after sizing. #Preshrink paper for 10–15 minutes in hot water #Hang to dry #Mix gelatin by slowly adding powder to warm water #Add 25g of chrome alum to gelatin and stir NOTE: carefully read the MSDS for chrome alum. It is a suspected carcinogen #Apply warm gelatin mixture to paper with sponge brush, or dipping the paper in warm gelatin solution. #Hang to dry #Wash paper for 10 minutes in cool running bath to remove excess chrome alum #Hang to dry NOTE: If pigment stains paper after printing, repeat step 7 with remaining sized paper. This is why it’s important to make notes in the margins or on the back of your prints. Indicate each step including how many coats, length of baths, and hardening agent for archival and personal purposes. (Other hardening agents not recommended are Glyoxal, Formalin, & formaldehyde.) In this way you can easily trace your steps to find mistakes or places to improve your printing. = Sensitizing paper = #Mix part A & B #Coat with sponge brush in low incandescent light #Dry in dark or nearly dark = Printing in one color = coat and dry several sheets of paper, choose a softly lit image with strong tonal gradation. #Place intermediate negative with sensitized paper (clamp down with a piece of glass). #Test exposures, 30 secs to 2 minutes with film negatives (paper negatives take several hours). #Cover paper in cold water face down until orange dichromate and gum pigment diffuses out. #Choose the time that produces the best results and expose a second sheet, and start again with best exposure time. #After processing full print, brush away unwanted shadows with a small soft water color brush #Tape print to board and let dry = Printing in three colors = #Make three color separations (blue, green, and red filters) use panchromatic film #Mix three pigmented gum solutions (yellow, magenta, and cyan) add sensitizer before applying each to the paper #Coat with sensitized yellow gum and expose to the blue separation. #Process and dry, recoat with magenta gum to print to the green separation. #Repeat in cyan and red separation. = Printing in four colors = Before you begin, coat a small sheet of paper with emulsion and let dry. Make a test exposure on the small sheet using a Stouffer scale to determine correct exposure time for your light source. #Scan your image or open an existing digital image file. #Using a photo editing program, convert the image file to CMYK. #Separate the individual CMYK color plates into four grayscale digital images (i.e. split the channels in, e.g., Photoshop). #Label each image with its corresponding color. #Invert the images to create four negatives. #Print each of the grayscale images (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) onto inkjet transparency film in black and white. (Thin images work better than dense ones.) #Lay two of the negatives (i.e. Black and Cyan) together and align the corners of the image, then use two pushpins on the outer edge to create registration holes. #Repeat the registration process with one of the registered negatives (i.e. Cyan and Yellow or Cyan and Magenta) for the other two negatives. #Coat and dry a gelatin sized piece of paper with the least dense color (Yellow) emulsion first. #Pushpin the negative to the paper creating the registration holes for the other three colors. #Tape negative edges to paper and remove pushpins. #Insert paper and negative into a contact frame or vacuum printing frame and expose according to Stouffer scale results. #Remove negative and float paper face down in a tray of still water for 30 minutes. #Gently move print to fresh tray of still water to rinse for 10 more minutes. #Hang to dry. #Repeat steps 9 through 15 for Cyan, then Magenta, and finally the Black negative. = Archival wash = When the print is completely dry and no more layers will be applied, a potassium metabisulfite clearing bath is used to remove excess dichromate trapped in the paper. This can be seen on the reverse of the paper as a yellow stain where pigment was applied on the verso. In a well-ventilated room mix 250g potassium metabisulphite in a tray of water and soak the print for 1–5 minutes. This bath may soften the image so care must be taken when washing away the metabisulphite in the next step. In a separate tray, gently run cool water for 10–20 minutes with the print face down to remove all metabisulphite solution. Hang to dry.

The tune was possibly taken from a song dating back from the American Civil War called \\"Carry me back to Tennessee\\" or \\"Sweet Ellie Rhee\\" with the words roughly translated into Afrikaans. In the English translation, the song begins: \\"My Sarie Marais is so far from my heart but I hope to see her again. She lived near the Mooi River before this war began...\\"; and the chorus is: \\"Oh, take me back to the old Transvaal, there where my Sarie lives, down there among the maize fields near the green thorn tree, there lives my Sarie Marais.\\" It continues about the fear of being removed far, \\"over the sea\\" (in fact, of the 28,000 Boer men taken prisoner by the ruling British authorities, over 25,000 were transported overseas). As well as becoming very well known in South Africa, the song was taken up by various people, organizations and singers in other countries.  Origins of the song The origins of the song are unclear. One account of the story refers to the American folk song Ellie Rhee, written in 1865 by Septimus Winner (1827–1902) and included in a book entitled \\"The Cavendish Song Album\\". An account on the National Anthems forum supports J.P. Toerien as author and his wife Sarie Maré as the subject of the song. It too suggests the song's origins go back to Sweet Ellie Rhee. The claim is that this song was sung by Americans working in the Transvaal gold mines, and heard there by Afrikaans journalist and poet Jacobus Petrus Toerien, who re-wrote the song in Afrikaans, substituting the name of Ellie Rhee with that of his own beloved Sarie Maré (Susara Margaretha Maré). Another account is that the song dates from the First Anglo-Boer War (1880–1881). When Ella de Wet, wife of General Louis Botha's military attaché Nicolaas Jacobus de Wet came to the battle front to see her husband she often played on the piano while the nearby burghers sang songs from the Cavendish album. The burghers supposedly wanted to honour their field chaplain Dominee Paul Nel, who often told stories around the campfires about his childhood and his beautiful mother Sarie Maré, who died young. Whatever its origins, the song changed and got more verses as time went on. This accounts for the reference to the Kakies (af) (or khakis), as the Boers called the British soldiers during the Second Anglo-Boer War. They were known as Rooibaadjies (\\"red coats\\") during the First Anglo-Boer War. Later spread and influence of the song The song quickly spread due to soldiers coming back from the South African Boer War. The melody was adopted in 1953 as the official march of the United Kingdom's Commandos and is played after the Regimental March on ceremonial occasions. The French École militaire interarmes also sings the song, in its French translation. The song has been sung by Jim Reeves and Kenneth McKellar in Afrikaans. Sarie, Volksblad's sister magazine, was also named for her. Many hotels and apartment complexes are named after her. During the first international broadcast between South Africa, Britain, and America during the birthday of Mrs. Isie Smuts, the wife of the prime minister, general Jan Smuts, Sarie Marais was sung by Gracie Fields. During the second world war, there was a unit of soldiers called \\"Sarie Marais calling\\". The South African army, as well as the French foreign legion, play this march during parades. It is also the official song of the Girl Guides of Sri Lanka ( Ceylon ) who heard the Boerekrygsgevangenes (af – Boer prisoner of war) perform it during the beginning of the last century. During the 1930s it was incorrectly played as South Africa's official national anthem. Germans cultivated a pink rose called Sarie Maries which is planted in the School of Armour in Tempe, Bloemfontein. =Sarie Marais (1931): the first South African film with sound= Sarie Marais was also the title of the first South African talking picture, directed by Joseph Albrecht (af) and made in 1931. Filmed in Johannesburg, Sarie Marais manages to pack a lot into its 10-minute running time. Set in a British POW camp, the film concentrates on a group of Boer prisoners as they pass the time under the watchful eye of their British captors. One of the internees, played by Billy Mathews, lifts his voice in song with the popular Afrikaans patriotic tune \\"My Sarie Marais\\". His enthusiasm catches on with the other prisoners, giving them hope for the future.http://movies2.nytimes.com Afrikaner nationalism was emerging as a force in these years, and Sarie Marais portrayed the British cultural and economic imperialism hostilely, with the desire to spread the English language, culture and influence even where it was unwelcome. Shortly after this film's release, a group of Afrikaner nationalists established a film production organisation called the Reddingsdaad-Bond-Amateur-Rolprent Organisasie (Rescue Action League Amateur Film Organisation), which rallied against British and American films pervading the country. Francis Coley directed a remake of this film, again titled Sarie Marais in 1949 (af). =Sarie women's magazine= The contemporary Afrikaans women's magazine Sarie takes its name from this song. Originally entitled Sarie Marais – a name which at the time (1949) of its first publication was synonymous with the idea of empowered Afrikaans womanhood – it was the first Afrikaans magazine to focus on the female market, with a content ranging from fashion, decor, and beauty to relationship advice and family planning. The actual Sarie Marais Grave of Sara Johanna Adriana Maré. It is not clear if Sarie Marais was a real person or fictitious. Two persons have been mentioned as being the real Sarie Marais: Sarie Maré (full name Sara Johanna Adriana Maré) (1840–1877) and Sarie Maré (full name Susara Margaretha Maré) (1869–1939).Louise Bethlehem (2003). Transferential Zionism? Manfred Nathan's Sarie Marais: A Romance of the Anglo- Boer War. =Sara Johanna Adriana Maré= Sara Johanna Adriana Maré was born in Uitenhage, Cape Province on 10 May 1840. She married Louis Jacobus Nel in 1857 in Pietermaritzburg. Maré died at the age of 37 after giving birth to her 11th child, and was buried near the old homestead on their farm Welgegund, near Greytown, KwaZulu-Natal. As noted above, one of her sons was field chaplain Dominee Paul Nel, who served in the First Anglo-Boer War and supposedly often told stories around the campfires about his childhood and his beautiful mother Sarie Maré, who died young. =Susara Margaretha Maré= Susara Margaretha Maré (1869–1939), eldest daughter of Jacob Philippus Maré and Cornelia Susanna Jacoba Erasmus, was born on 15 April 1869 at Eendraght (an archaic spelling of \\"Unity\\") Farm, in Suikerbosrand, Transvaal. In later life she was also nicknamed Tant Mossie (auntie Mossie).South African Library catalogue entry AP.1998-227 Her parents were Voortrekkers who established themselves in the Suikerbosrand area. Her father Jacob Maré became highly regarded in the Transvaal, and a street in Pretoria is named for him. At the time when Susara Margaretha's parents settled in the area, the town of Heidelberg still did not exist. The greatest concentration of voortrekkers could be found near the Mooirivier, where Potchefstroom stands today. Suikerbosrand was at that time in the Mooirivier Ward. When she was 16 years old, she met Jacobus Petrus Toerien – journalist (and later a well-known poet) who wrote under the pseudonym of Jepete in \\"Ons Kleintje\\" and was editor of \\"Di Patriot\\". As a representative of the Patriots of Paarl, he was in Pretoria to conduct a meeting with her father. They were married and had sixteen children, of whom only eight survived. One common version of the song's origin attributes its authorship to Toerien, who heard the song Sweet Ellie Rhee from American workers in the Transvaal gold mines. In the time between the First War of Independence and the second one – as the wars with the British were considered – Toerien re-wrote the song in Afrikaans, substituting for the name of Ellie Rhee that of his own beloved wife Sarie Maré. The words still did not exactly match the ones we know today. Maré later became Marais due to a misspelling. In 1899 Sarie was hit by a bullet. She was not hit by the English soldiers, but by others. Sarie was a very religious woman, and in later years tried her best to disassociate herself with the song. When Jacobus died in 1920, she moved her daughters to Bloemfontein where she lived the rest of her life. She died there on 22 December 1939, at the age of 73. She is buried in an unmarked grave in the Memoriam-begraafplaas (memorium burying place) by the Vrouemonument (woman's monument) \\"Sweet Ellie Rhee\\" lyrics 170px The American folk song, \\"Ellie Rhee\\", (or \\"Carry me back to Tennessee\\" written in 1865 by Septimus Winner (1827–1902), is widely considered to have influenced the South African song.

It is housed in the Palazzo Bianco, Genoa. According to Giambatista Cardi, nephew of the Florentine artist Cigoli, Cardinal Massimo Massimi commissioned paintings on the theme of Ecce Homo from three artists, Cigoli, Caravaggio, and Domenico Passignano, without informing the artists of the multiple commissions. Cardi claimed the cardinal liked Cigoli's version best. The scene is taken from the Gospel of (John 19): Pontius Pilate displays Christ to the crowd with the words, \\"Ecce homo!\\" (\\"Behold the man\\"). Caravaggio's version of the scene combined Pilate's display with the earlier moment of Christ, already crowned with thorns, mockingly robed like a king by his tormentors. Massimi already possessed a Crowning with Thorns, by Caravaggio, and Ecce Homo may have been intended as a companion piece. Stylistically, the painting displays characteristics of Caravaggio's mature Roman-period style. The forms are visible close-up and modelled by dramatic light, the absence of depth or background, and the psychological realism of, the torturer, who seems to mix sadism with pity. Pilate, in keeping with tradition, is shown as a rather neutral and perhaps almost sympathetic figure. He is also depicted wearing anachronistic clothing which was more contemporary to Caravaggio's time. Ecce Homo, Cigoli, 1607. Pitti Palace, Florence. Cigoli, in his most famous painting, has deliberately adapted his own lyrical style to Caravaggio's more dramatic realism. The contract for Ecce Homo was signed on 25 June 1605, with the painting to be delivered in August. Whether Caravaggio met his deadline is uncertain, as by July he was arrested for attacking the house of Laura della Vecchia and her daughter, Isabella. Friends stood bail for him, but on 29 July he was in far more serious trouble for assaulting the notary Mariano Pasqualone over a well- known courtesan Lena and Caravaggio's model who is referred to by Pasqualone in the police complaint as \\"Michelangelo's (i.e. Caravaggio's) girl\\". Consequently, Caravaggio fled to Genoa until the end of August. He continued to be in trouble with the law throughout the year, with a complaint against him in September for throwing stones at his landlady's house, and a mysterious incident in October in which he was wounded in the throat and ear (Caravaggio claimed he had fallen on his own sword). In May 1606 he fled Rome again after killing Ranuccio Tomassoni in a duel, and he was not settled in Naples until the latter part of that year. Cigoli's Ecce Homo was not painted until 1607, and clearly attempts to mimic Caravaggio's style, suggesting that Massimi had not yet received his Caravaggio and was turning elsewhere.Cigoli, Ecce Homo 1607 It is instructive to compare the two paintings: Caravaggio, unlike Cigoli, has dropped the convention of showing Christ's torturer as a grotesque, and has shown Pilate dressed as a 17th-century official. Several scholars, such as Sebastian Schutze dispute the attribution of this work to Caravaggio, with Schutze noting that \\"the composition seems extremely cramped, and it's narrative structure strangely fractured. The Roman governor seems to belong to a quite different plane of reality; he appears like the donor figure in an altarpiece and is painted in a different manner, with his facial features exaggerated almost to the point of caricature.\\"  Restorations  After a first restoration during the XVIII Century, a second one has been made in 1954 by Pico Cellini in Rome. The last restoration has been carried out in Genoa by Cristina Bonavera Parodi in 2003: during this operation, the full examination of the painting with new techniques (X-rays, Infrared reflectography, UV light reader, optical microscopy) confirmed the clear attribution of the work to Caravaggio, as studied by Anna Orlando.

In 1978, he had an unsuccessful run as the Republican Party nominee for Governor of California and retired from politics a year later. He joined the firm Buchalter, Nemer, Fields, & Younger as a senior partner in 1979 where he worked until his death a decade later. Early life and education Younger was a second cousin twice removed of the Younger Brothers, a notable 19th- century gang of American outlaws that are often associated with the Jesse James gang. He was born in Stamford, Nebraska in 1918 and received his law degree from Nebraska University. Career After graduating law school, Younger became an FBI Special Agent. At the age of 24, when he was one of J. Edgar Hoover's top agents, Younger became a member of CIA forerunner the Office of Strategic Services, serving in the Burma-China-India theater during World War II.Richard Smith, OSS: The Secret History of America's First Central Intelligence Agency, p. 18.

It is owned and operated by San Antonio-based iHeartMedia, Inc., and it airs a news/talk radio format. WOAI is the flagship station for iHeartMedia. Its studios are located in the Stone Oak neighborhood in Far North San Antonio. WOAI is known as the \\"50,000 Watt Blowtorch\\" of South Texas.http://www.woai.com/pages/woaihistory.html It is a Class A, clear- channel station broadcasting at the maximum power of 50,000 watts. Its non- directional antenna is off Santa Clara Road in Zuehl, Texas. In the daytime, WOAI covers most of Central and South Texas, providing at least secondary coverage as far north as the Waco suburbs and as far south as Corpus Christi. With a good radio, WOAI's nighttime signal reaches much of the United States and Mexico, and parts of Central Canada. However, it is strongest in the central United States. History WOAI signed on the air on September 25, 1922. At first it broadcast on 1190 kilocycles with only 500 watts. Over the next several years WOAI was issued permits by the Federal Radio Commission to move the transmitter site and increase its power from 500 to 1,000 watts; then to 2,000 watts, and then 5,000; and finally to 50,000 watts in 1930. During the 1930s, WOAI was an NBC Red Network affiliate, and for more than four decades, was owned by Southland Industries, Inc. Because it went on the air in the earliest days of broadcasting, the station's call sign begins with a \\"W.\\" Stations in Texas were assigned W call signs before 1923, when the dividing line moved from the Texas-New Mexico border to the Mississippi River. Both WOAI-TV and briefly WOAI-FM were later allowed to use the call sign as well. WOAI and WOAI-TV are currently the westernmost stations to have \\"W\\" call signs. In 1941, WOAI was moved to clear channel frequency 1200 kHz. This meant that WOAI was the only high power non-directional station that could be licensed on its frequency in the United States. In fact, until the 1980s, it was the only station of any power licensed to 1200 kHz in the United States or Canada. This was part of an early federal emergency plan similar to today's Emergency Alert System. In the 1940s, WOAI developed a sizable agricultural department and the station aired frequent farm market reports. In 1949, WOAI- TV came on the air as San Antonio's first TV station. Because WOAI Radio was an NBC affiliate, Channel 4 was primarily an NBC-TV station, although it also carried some programs from CBS, ABC and Dumont. In 1956, a Boeing B-29 collided with the tower, destroying it. The aircraft made a crash landing, and one person was killed. As network programming moved from radio to television in the 1950s, WOAI switched to a full service middle of the road music format, with frequent newscasts, farm reports and sports. In 1965, WOAI-FM-TV were acquired by the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation, originally founded in Ohio by Powel Crosley Jr. Crosley Broadcasting changed its name to Avco in 1968. On June 13, 1975, San Antonio businessmen L. Lowry Mays and BJ \\"Red\\" McCombs founded Clear Channel Communications by acquiring the WOAI radio from Avco Broadcasting. They already owned easy listening FM station KEEZ (now KAJA), acquired in 1972, and switched to a Top 40 format. Meanwhile, Avco sold WOAI- TV to United Stations which changed the call sign to KMOL-TV. Through the 1970s, WOAI had been adding more talk programming. It stopped playing music by the late 1970s. In 1979, KEEZ switched its call letters to WOAI-FM. But in 1981, it became country music station KAJA \\"KJ*97.\\" Through the 1980s, WOAI relied more on its newsroom and focused on local and national news, local talk shows and agricultural reports. WOAI also began including sports play-by-play, especially after acquiring the radio contract for all San Antonio Spurs NBA games. WOAI was the radio home of the San Antonio Gunslingers in the United States Football League (USFL). In 1998, Clear Channel acquired the parent company of Premiere Radio Networks, which syndicated national talk shows such as Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Laura, Dr. Dean Edell, The Jim Rome Show and Coast to Coast AM. Rush and Dr. Laura had already been airing in San Antonio on competitor KTSA and were switched over to WOAI's line up. WOAI news anchor Bob Guthrie celebrated 50 years on the radio station in 2006. In 2001, Clear Channel acquired Channel 4 KMOL-TV San Antonio from Chris-Craft Industries. KMOL-TV had been WOAI-TV from its founding in 1949 until its sale in 1974. In December 2002, Clear Channel was granted permission from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to change the TV station's call sign back to WOAI-TV. The TV station has since been sold twice, to Newport Television and then to current owner Sinclair Broadcast Group.

In this case, they are, roughly speaking, \\"as consistent as each other\\". In general, it is not possible to prove the absolute consistency of a theory T. Instead we usually take a theory S, believed to be consistent, and try to prove the weaker statement that if S is consistent then T must also be consistent—if we can do this we say that T is consistent relative to S. If S is also consistent relative to T then we say that S and T are equiconsistent.  Consistency  In mathematical logic, formal theories are studied as mathematical objects. Since some theories are powerful enough to model different mathematical objects, it is natural to wonder about their own consistency. Hilbert proposed a program at the beginning of the 20th century whose ultimate goal was to show, using mathematical methods, the consistency of mathematics. Since most mathematical disciplines can be reduced to arithmetic, the program quickly became the establishment of the consistency of arithmetic by methods formalizable within arithmetic itself. Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that Hilbert's program cannot be realized: if a consistent recursively enumerable theory is strong enough to formalize its own metamathematics (whether something is a proof or not), i.e. strong enough to model a weak fragment of arithmetic (Robinson arithmetic suffices), then the theory cannot prove its own consistency. There are some technical caveats as to what requirements the formal statement representing the metamathematical statement \\"The theory is consistent\\" needs to satisfy, but the outcome is that if a (sufficiently strong) theory can prove its own consistency then either there is no computable way of identifying whether a statement is even an axiom of the theory or not, or else the theory itself is inconsistent (in which case it can prove anything, including false statements such as its own consistency). Given this, instead of outright consistency, one usually considers relative consistency: Let S and T be formal theories. Assume that S is a consistent theory. Does it follow that T is consistent? If so, then T is consistent relative to S. Two theories are equiconsistent if each one is consistent relative to the other.  Consistency strength  If T is consistent relative to S, but S is not known to be consistent relative to T, then we say that S has greater consistency strength than T. When discussing these issues of consistency strength the metatheory in which the discussion takes places needs to be carefully addressed. For theories at the level of second-order arithmetic, the reverse mathematics program has much to say. Consistency strength issues are a usual part of set theory, since this is a recursive theory that can certainly model most of mathematics. The most widely used set of axioms of set theory is called ZFC. When a set-theoretic statement is said to be equiconsistent to another , what is being claimed is that in the metatheory (Peano Arithmetic in this case) it can be proven that the theories ZFC+ and ZFC+ are equiconsistent. Usually, primitive recursive arithmetic can be adopted as the metatheory in question, but even if the metatheory is ZFC or an extension of it, the notion is meaningful. The method of forcing allows one to show that the theories ZFC, ZFC+CH and ZFC+¬CH are all equiconsistent (where CH denotes the continuum hypothesis). When discussing fragments of ZFC or their extensions (for example, ZF, set theory without the axiom of choice, or ZF+AD, set theory with the axiom of determinacy), the notions described above are adapted accordingly. Thus, ZF is equiconsistent with ZFC, as shown by Gödel. The consistency strength of numerous combinatorial statements can be calibrated by large cardinals. For example, the negation of Kurepa's hypothesis is equiconsistent with an inaccessible cardinal, the non-existence of special \\\\omega_2-Aronszajn trees is equiconsistent with a Mahlo cardinal, and the non-existence of \\\\omega_2-Aronszajn trees is equiconsistent with a weakly compact cardinal.* See also *Large cardinal property References * Akihiro Kanamori (2003).

He later became a professor of public administration at the University of Southern California (USC). Born in New York City, he attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he was active in the Cornell University Glee Club and the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He studied under Clinton Rossiter, a Cornell faculty member who was an authority on The Federalist. After graduating from Cornell in 1950, he served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War. In 1956, he earned a Ph.D. in politics at Princeton University. While in New Jersey, he worked in politics as a researcher for the New Jersey Legislature and an aide to Senator H. Alexander Smith. In 1957, he took a faculty position in the Pomona College Department of Political Science, where he quickly won tenure and remained a full time professor until 1960 and a part time faculty member until 1966, when he ran for California State Controller. In 1960, he successfully ran for California State Assembly as a Republican Party candidate, and served from 1961 to 1967. In 1966, he was elected California State Controller and served as Controller from 1967 to 1975. In 1974 he ran for Governor of California. He defeated the more conservative choice, Lieutenant Governor Ed Reinecke, in the GOP primary but then lost a surprisingly close election to Jerry Brown in a heavily Democratic year. Flournoy, who blamed the September 1974 Gerald Ford pardon of Richard Nixon for his loss, never ran for political office again. In 1976, he was appointed professor at USC in Los Angeles. He taught at the School of Public Administration (now part of the School of Policy, Planning, and Development) until 1993. He also served the USC administration as a governmental affairs advisor until 1999. He also served on the boards of several corporations. After retirement he resided in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, and Bodega Bay, California. Flournoy died of congestive heart failure on January 7, 2008, on a flight from San Diego to Santa Rosa, California.

Their songs have appeared in several television shows, including Gene Simmons Family Jewels, Laguna Beach, and The Dudesons. Several members of Watershed formed The Dead Schembechlers, a punk band based on the Ohio State-Michigan rivalry. Watershed has appeared on tour with several other bands, including the shock-rap group Insane Clown Posse. Watershed is managed by Thomas O'Keefe, a longtime fan of the band. Members Current members: *Joe Oestreich (bass and vocals) is a professor of English at Coastal Carolina University. He has published essays in magazines such as Esquire and Sports Illustrated and in the literary journals Ninth Letter and Fourth Genre. Several of his essays have been shortlisted for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's Best American Essays series. Oestreich's memoir about Watershed, entitled Hitless Wonder: A Life in Minor League Rock and Roll, was released by Lyons Press in June 2012. *Colin Gawel (guitar and vocals) Owns Colin's Coffee in Upper Arlington, OH and founded the website Pencilstorm.com. He also performs and releases music as both a solo artist and with The League Bowlers. His band, Why Isn't Cheap Trick in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? disbanded when Cheap Trick got inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. *Rick Kinsinger (guitar) previously played in Ohio-based bands Pfifer and The Blasphemy Saints. He has also played in Colin Gawel & the Lonely Bones and currently plays in The League Bowlers. He is an engineer who has recorded tracks for the Dead Schembechlers, Watershed, Colin Gawel and The League Bowlers. *Herb Schupp (drums) is an original member of the band and was friends with Oestreich and Gawel in high school. He also plays in The League Bowlers and is known for his love of spicy food. Former members: *Mark \\"Poochie\\" Borror was a touring guitarist and still plays in the power pop band Twin Cam. *Joe Peppercorn (piano and guitar) is a classically trained pianist and a bartender in Columbus. Aside from Watershed, he is locally known for performing the entire Beatles catalog in single 13-hour sessions.He also writes and performs with The Whiles. *Dave Masica played drums with the band from 1998 - 2013 before back problems led to his retirement from performing. History The group formed in 1987 when the four founding members were still teenagers. After being signed to Epic Records in the mid-1990s, they were dropped by the label in favor of Silverchair. In 1998, Watershed toured with controversial shock-rap duo Insane Clown Posse, with Gawel saying that \\"It's a really harsh crowd, but they like us because we're rock and roll survivors.\\" A lyric from Watershed's song \\"Black Concert T-Shirt\\" provides the title for Pulitzer Prize finalist Lee Martin's novel Break the Skin. The band also makes an appearance in the book itself. In 2012, Oestreich released Hitless Wonder, a memoir about his years in Watershed. Although the band had largely faded from popularity, the book received national media attention. The band released a single in 2016 featuring two new songs produced by Tim Patalan. As of this time, original drummer Herb Schupp had rejoined the band and longtime collaborator Rick Kinsinger replaced Joe Peppercorn, who was involved in his own band. In August 2019, the Watershed Hullabaloo featured the band performing shows on three consecutive days in their hometown of Columbus,Ohio. All the shows sold out and the band played 74 different original songs over the three day period. In January 2020 they began working on a new EP with producer Tim Patalan with plans for a summer 2020 release. =Dead Schembechlers= In 2004, two of the original Watershed members, Gawel and Oestreich, joined with vocalist Lou Brutus and Twin Cam guitarist Mike Sammons on drums to form the punk band Dead Schembechlers based on the Ohio State- Michigan football game and rivalry. The side project's name, a play on the Dead Kennedys, was a lighthearted jab at former Michigan coach Bo Schembechler, who upon hearing about the band name was reportedly quite amused. The four members go by the pseudonyms of Bo Vicious (after Sex Pistols frontman Sid Vicious), Bo Biafra (after Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys), Bo Scabies (after Rat Scabies of The Damned), and Bo Thunders (after Johnny Thunders). The group quickly gained more popularity than Watershed itself. Following Schembechler's passing on November 17, 2006, the Dead Schembechlers changed their name to the \\"Bastard Sons of Woody\\", a reference to former Ohio State coach Woody Hayes. The band chose to respect their team's former opponent rather than becoming infamous, with Oestreich stating: \\"If we were a legit, safety-pin-in-the-ear punk band, we would have left the sign and issued a statement saying, We're glad the bastard croaked, and we sincerely hope crows are eating his eyes this very minute. But we're hot-dog-and-a-ball-game guys. With wives and kids and mortgages. Our fans are football fans, not punk rockers.\\" The band plays many anti-Wolverine songs to the tune of rock \\"legends\\" such as Kiss and The Ramones. A long-running joke on the official Dead Schembechlers website claims they originally wrote the tunes and other bands just stole the riffs. The band 'claims' to have released numerous singles and albums throughout the years, but in reality they only released two albums. In 2004 the album Rocket to Ann Arbor was released and soon after re- released as Wolverine Destroyer with a new track and alternate versions of existing songs. The band \\"reunited\\" under the Dead Schembechlers name in 2008, and released a new EP, entitled \\"Rodriguez to Ruin,\\" which poked fun at Wolverines head football coach Rich Rodriguez. Singles from the new release included \\"Rodriguez is a Weasel\\" (which the band claims was used as inspiration for the Toledo Rockets' upset of Michigan); and \\"I'm So Bored with the SEC.\\" The band played two live concerts in 2008; their Cleveland show was their first to be scheduled outside of Columbus.

Born in Mexico, Del Toro pitched for the San Francisco Giants during the and seasons. Career Del Toro was a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates organization through the majority of the '90s. However, beyond one brief spring training appearance, he remained in his native Mexico. Born in Sonora and a resident of Mexico City, Del Toro was a pitcher for the Mexico City Red Devils. He became serious about making it to Major League Baseball when he arrived for the Pirates' 1998 Spring training. After not making the 40 man roster, he was granted free agency. After impressing the Giants in Spring training, Del Toro made not only the 40 man roster, but the 1999 Opening Day 25 man list. Later, he was optioned to the Pacific Coast League's Fresno Grizzlies. At Triple-A Fresno, Del Toro played as both a starter and a reliever. He continued to play in both the minors and the majors, finishing the season with a 4.18 ERA in 14 games and 20 strikeouts. Wearing No. 37, Del Toro began the season in Fresno. His first career Major League Baseball victory came against the Montreal Expos. Del Toro relieved Kirk Rueter, pitching two scoreless innings. He struck out two and shook off a line drive off his leg. Del Toro had his second major league victory on September 23, 2000. Del Toro lasted five innings, striking out four. He continued to pitch for the remainder of the year, including the final defensive inning of the year, working Game 5 of the 2000 National League Division Series against the New York Mets. After the year, the Giants sold his contract to the Japanese League's Seibu Lions. Del Toro's days in Major League Baseball were over, leaving the Giants with 2000 season stats of a 2–0 record and a 5.19 ERA. Death Days after Del Toro cut ties with Seibu, he was traveling with two companions in Ciudad Obregón. Del Toro's car collided with an agricultural tractor, killing him and his two companions; Del Toro was 29. Del Toro was survived by his expecting wife, Eloisa, and two children – Maria and Miguel. The Giants honored Del Toro's life with a brief moment of silence, and Seibu left his Japanese League No. 32 unworn for the following season.

In the Annals of Ulster and in the Book of Leinster, Findláech is called rí Alban, which meant \\"King of Scotland\\" in the Gaelic language. As far as we know from other sources, the only rí Alban of the time was Máel Coluim mac Cináeda, i.e. Máel Coluim II, so this title can only mean that Findláech, as ruler of Moray, was understood by many to have been the High King of all northern Britain. However, Findláech's main claim to fame these days is as the father of Mac Bethad, made famous by William Shakespeare's play Macbeth. Indeed, the Irish historian known in Latin as Marianus Scotus calls Macbethad simply MacFindlaeg. Historians are fairly certain that Findláech was ruling before 1014 because the Orkneyinga Saga reads that before the Battle of Clontarf, Jarl Siguðr of Orkney fought a battle with the Scots, who were led by a Jarl Finnlekr (i.e. Findláech the Mormaer). An Irish princess called Eithne made a banner for Siguðr, which had on it a raven. The saga records that Siguðr later brought the banner to Clontarf, where he was killed. If we believe this, then Findláech would be ruler quite a bit before 1014. His death date, as mentioned above, derives from the Annals of Ulster, which notes s.a. 1020 Finnloech m. Ruaidhri, ri Alban, a suis occisus est, that is, that Findláech was killed by his own people. No reason for this is given, but the logical thing is to conclude that his successor, his nephew Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti, had something to do with it. Indeed, the Annals of Tigernach tell us that the sons of Máel Brigte were responsible; the only sons we know of are Máel Coluim and Gille Coemgáin, both of whom evidently benefited from the killing, as both succeeded to the throne.

Some historians have argued that this was Máel Coluim mac Cináeda of Scotland, but Hudson has suggested that Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti is the more likely candidate (p. 135).

Patented in 1889 by W. W. J. Nicol (1855-1929), the Kallitype print is an iron-silver process. A chemical process similar to the Van Dyke brown based on the use of a combination of ferric and silver salts. While Van Dyke brown and argyrotype use ferric ammonium citrate, the light-sensitive element used for the Kallitype is ferric oxalate. The use of ferric oxalate allows for both extended shadow definition (higher DMAX) and contrast control. Many developing solutions can be used to give a different image color (brown, sepia, blue, maroon and black). Kallitype images generally have a richer tonal range than the cyanotype. These prints were popular in the 19th century, and then their popularity faded away. Sometimes known as \\"the poor man's platinum print\\", when the image is toned in platinum or palladium the result is nearly chemically identical to a true Platinotype. It is believed that many Kallitypes were passed off as true Platinotypes and remain in collections as so. Kallitypes have had a reputation over the years as having poor archival qualities and often fading. When properly cleared, Kallitypes are completely archivable and will not fade. Toning with a metal such as gold, platinum, or palladium will give extra image permanence. Ferrous ions embedded in the paper as a result of poor clearing is the cause of the lack of belief in image permanence. This can be easily identified by a yellow stain in the highlights. A Kallitype test print toned in platinum by Zev Schmitz Process Like the Platinotype and Cyanotype, the kallitype is a contact printing process and the printer must have a negative of equal size to print from. Modern kallitypes are generally made from either a large format camera negative, an enlarged internegative from a traditional wet darkroom, or a digital negative. Cotton rag paper is generally recommended for printing kallitypes, although multiple paper types will lead to satisfactory results. Gloves should be worn during coating and when handling sensitizer as the sensitizer chemicals can be quite toxic. While the Van Dyke Brown and Argyrotype are both \\"printing out\\" processes (with the complete image being formed during exposure), the Kallitype is a \\"develop out\\" process that requires the print to be submerged in a developer solution to make the image visible after exposure. Like the Platinotype, the image will appear instantly when the paper is submerged in the developer. The final tone of the print is controlled both via the developer choice and through the use of toning solutions such as gold and platinum toners.

Gonzalo Guerrero (also known as Gonzalo Marinero, Gonzalo de Aroca and Gonzalo de Aroza) was a sailor from Palos, in Spain who was shipwrecked along the Yucatán Peninsula and was taken as a slave by the local Maya. Earning his freedom, Guerrero became a respected warrior under a Maya Lord and raised three of the first mestizo children in Mexico and presumably the first mixed children of the mainland Americas. Little is known of his early life. Shipwreck In 1511, sailing with 15 others including Gerónimo de Aguilar in a caravel from Panama and heading for Santo Domingo, he was shipwrecked. However, the crew managed to board the ship's lifeboat and drifted for two weeks along the Yucatán Peninsula until strong currents brought them to the shore of what is now Quintana Roo, in Mexico. On reaching land, Guerrero and the other members of the crew were captured by the local Maya. Slavery Bernal Díaz de Castillo (Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España, Chapter XXIX) records Aguilar's account, whereby Mayans sacrificed some of the ship's crew almost immediately, while putting the rest into cages. The Spanish managed to escape, but other Mayan lords captured and enslaved them. By 1519, the year Hernán Cortés began his Conquest of Mexico, only two from the original shipwreck remained alive: Gonzalo Guerrero, who by this time had become famous in the Mayan world as a war leader for Nachan Can, Lord of Chactemal (which included parts of Mexico and Belize); and Gerónimo de Aguilar, who had taken holy orders in his native Spain. Guerrero had by then married Nachan Can's daughter Zazil Há and had fathered the first mestizo children in the region. Cortes also learned that it was Guerrero's suggestion which led to the earlier attack on Cordoba's expedition.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, Reluctance to return On arriving in Cozumel from Cuba, Cortés sent a letter by Maya messenger across to the mainland, inviting the two Spaniards, of whom he had heard rumors, to join him. Aguilar became a translator, along with Doña Marina, 'La Malinche', during the Conquest. According to the account of Bernal Díaz, when the newly freed friar attempted to convince Guerrero to join him, Guerrero responded: Spanish: \\"Hermano Aguilar, yo soy casado y tengo tres hijos. Tienenme por cacique y capitán, cuando hay guerras, la cara tengo labrada, y horadadas las orejas. ¿Que dirán de mi esos españoles, si me ven ir de este modo? Idos vos con la bendición de Dios, que ya veis que estos mis hijitos son bonitos, y dadme por vida vuestra de esas cuentas verdes que traeis, para darles, y diré, que mis hermanos me las envían de mi tierra.\\"Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España, Chapter XI English Translation: \\"Brother Aguilar; I am married and have three children, and they look on me as a cacique (lord) here, and captain in time of war. My face is tattooed and my ears are pierced. What would the Spaniards say about me if they saw me like this? Go and God's blessing be with you, for you have seen how handsome these children of mine are. Please give me some of those beads you have brought to give to them and I will tell them that my brothers have sent them from my own country.\\" Díaz goes on to describe how Gonzalo's Mayan wife, Zazil Há, interrupted the conversation and angrily addressed Aguilar in her own language: Spanish: \\" Y asimismo la india mujer del Gonzalo habló a Aguilar en su lengua, muy enojada y le dijo: Mira con qué viene este esclavo a llamar a mi marido: idos vos y no curéis de más pláticas. \\"Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España, Chapter XI English Translation: \\"And the Indian wife of Gonzalo spoke to Aguilar in her own tongue very angrily and said to him, \\"What is this slave coming here for talking to my husband, - go off with you, and don't trouble us with any more words.\\"\\" Then Aguilar spoke to Guerrero again, reminding him of his Christian faith and warning him against throwing away his everlasting soul for the sake of an Indian woman. But he did not convince Gonzalo. According to Robert S. Chamberlain,Conquest and Colonization of Yucatan, p.63 Francisco de Montejo discovered that Guerrero was the military captain of Chectumal. He tried to win him over by sending him a longish letter reminding him of his Christian faith, offering him his friendship and a complete pardon, and asking him to come to the caravel. Guerrero replied by writing on the back of the letter that he could not leave his Lord because he was a slave, \\"even though I am married and have a wife and children. I remember God, and you, Sir, and the Spaniards have a good friend in me.\\" Guerrero appears to have told his Maya friends and family that the Spaniards would suffer death like other men. He led the Maya in campaigns against Cortés and his lieutenants like Pedro de Alvarado and the Panamanian governor Pedrarias. Alvarado's instructions in his Honduras campaign included an order to capture Guerrero. Oviedo reports Guerrero as dead by 1532, when Montejo's lieutenants Avila and Lujón arrived again in Chectumal. Andrés de Cereceda, in a letter to the Spanish King dated August 14, 1536, writes of a battle that occurred in late June 1536 between Pedro de Alvarado and a local Honduran cacique named Çiçumba. The naked and tattooed body of a Spaniard was found dead within Çiçumba's town of Ticamaya after the battle. According to Cereceda, this Spaniard had come over with 50 war-canoes from Chetumal early in 1536, to help Çiçumba fight the Spanish who were attempting to colonize his lands. The Spaniard was killed in the battle by an arquebus shot. Although Cereceda says the Spaniard was named Gonzalo Aroca, R. Chamberlain and other historians writing about the event identify the man as Gonzalo Guerrero. Guerrero was likely 66 years old when he died.AGUIRRE, Eugenio (1986). Gonzalo Guerrero. México D.F: Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP). Lecturas Mexicanas Knowledge of Guerrero's existence There are no verified first- hand accounts written by Guerrero that have survived until today. The primary accounts of other people writing about him are our source of information. First, there is Geronimo de Aguilar, who says Guerrero was captured by the Maya at the same time as he was. Cortés exchanged letters with Guerrero, but did not meet him face to face. Bernal Díaz de Castillo wrote about the same events as Cortes. Cereceda found him dead on a battlefield in Honduras but never communicated with him. The initial Spanish attempts to chronicle the conquest, done in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries (Oviedo, Herrera), mention him, but are considered less accurate than the contemporaneous accounts. =Recent accounts= Although Guerrero appears in various historical chronicles of the conquest of Mexico and media and his existence is historically attested, some accounts of him are contradictory. These, coupled with often missing facts and historical falsehoods, have led over the centuries to a continuous redefinition of the character. This process started with the chroniclers of the 16th century and culminated in the 20th century with the Mexican Indigenismo, each with their own motivation and interpretation.Menna (2017) Literary critic Rose-Anna M. Mueller, in an essay titled From Cult to Comics: The Representation of Gonzalo Guerrero as Cultural Hero in Mexican Popular Culture, surveys the numerous depictions of Guerrero from a reviled figure for the sixteenth-century Spanish invaders to founder of modern Mexico. Yet, like many symbols, the reality behind this myth remains very questionable. Mueller concludes, 'while primary and secondary sources sketched Guerrero's history during the colonial period, today he has become a political and literary icon and has been transformed into a national myth... If he was reviled by the chroniclers, Guerrero has enjoyed a vindication of sorts, since he has become an exemplar who fills the need to connect the colonizers from Europe and the indigenous of the Americas in a domestic context' Perhaps the most famous literary work celebrating Guerrero as the father of the mestizos in Mexico remains Gonzalo Guerrero: Novela historica by Eugenio Aguirre published in 1980 in Mexico. The novel became a national bestseller and went on to win the Paris International Academy's silver medal in 1981. Another popular book published in Mexico in 1999, Guerrero and Heart's Blood by Alan Clark tells of the inward life and history of Guerrero and Aguilar. Guerrero and Aguilar are central figures in the historical novel Maya Lord by John Coe Robbins which was published in the U.S. in 2011. \\"The Confessions of Gonzalo Guerrero\\", by John Reisinger, was published in 2015, and is an historical novel written from Guerrero's point of view, exploring his motivations and conflicts, as well as his relation with his Mayan wife. American author David Stacton fictionalized Guerrero's life and exploits in his novel A Signal Victory (1960). Recently republished by Faber & Faber, the work is \\"David Stacton's eighth novel, and the first in what he envisaged as an 'American Triptych'... [It] paints a vivid picture of the impact of two great civilisations upon each other [and of] Guerrero's story - that of a man who found where his true loyalties lay, and pursued them to their inevitable end.\\" See also * Maya civilization * Spanish Conquest * Spanish conquest of Honduras#Abandonment of Buena Esperanza, 1536 * Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca References *Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo, Historia General y Natural de las Indias, Book XXXII, Chapter VI, 1851, Madrid. *Robert S.

The episode was the eleventh episode for the show's second season. The episode was written by John Pardee and Joey Murphy and was directed by Wendey Stanzler. It originally aired on Sunday, January 8, 2006. Plot During an open house gathering at Bree Van De Kamp's house, Gabrielle reminisces about how she was head cheerleader back in high school. Tom relates to this since he had huge crushes on some of the girls but because he was in the marching band he was labeled a \\"band geek\\". He tells the ladies that he did not get a kiss until he was 18. Gabrielle feels sorry for him and jokingly kisses him on the lips. Lynette takes it to heart and confronts Gabrielle about it after the guests leave. Gabrielle says that she was just being spontaneous and that she was not being serious. Bree sides with Lynette since Gabrielle is an attractive ex-model and she would not have liked the kiss either. The following morning, Lynette thanks Bree for siding with her and Bree tells her that Gabrielle had an affair with John. Lynette is shocked and makes sure that Gabrielle does not start pursuing Tom. When Lynette gets off work early, she finds Gabrielle in her kitchen helping Tom with baby Penny. Lynette asks why she is there and Gabrielle tells her that she was just helping Tom with a few things. Lynette tells Gabrielle she knows about the affair and to watch out. Later while Lynette and Tom are in bed, she asks if there is something going on. Tom tells her not to worry but says that he can't help it \\"if the women are drawn to him\\". After learning that the neighborhood is talking about her affair, Gabrielle decides to let Carlos \\"even the score\\" by letting him have an affair with anyone he wants. Carlos laughs off her offer. Lynette decides to take matters into her own hands by visiting Gabrielle the following afternoon and making amends. They later laugh over smoothies when Carlos walks in and Lynette wants to be even. Lynette gives Carlos a french kiss and Gabrielle begins to relate to how Lynette felt. The next day when Lynette returns home from work, she finds Carlos waiting for her. As per Gabrielle's suggestion, he asks her that if at any time she would like to have an affair he is ready. Lynette gives him a nervous laugh and walks into her house. After Bree's party, Susan discovers Zach Young throwing out the garbage. Zach greets her as Susan waves back. She goes to Mike's house to tell him Zach is back. Mike already knows and that Paul has asked him to stay away. Susan then tries to develop a plan of how she can reunite them. While this is going on, Paul is preparing to begin homeschool Zach. Zach then asks Paul if he murdered Mrs. Huber because of a blackmail note. Paul denies this and tells him that he is a good man incapable of murder. Zach then says that Mary Alice wasn't capable of suicide but she still did it. The following day, Julie tells her mother the perfect plan: bowling. Susan and Julie then ask Mike if that will be alright which he thinks is fine. Julie then e-mails Zach about the excursion and Zach accepts. Later at the bowling alley, Mike \\"unexpectedly\\" arrives much to the surprise of Zach and the two begin their bond, with Zach not knowing that Mike is his real father. Meanwhile, Bree discovers Andrew making out with Justin. She begins to pour herself a glass of wine as Andrew walks back in. Bree tells him to stay away from Justin since homosexuality will not be tolerated under her roof. Andrew tells her that he does not care and will continue to see Justin as he pleases. Bree warns him that she will send him back to deprogramming camp if he does not comply with her instructions. Andrew tells her that she should have another drink and not judge since he does not. The following morning, Bree finds Andrew asleep with his arm around Justin. Bree screams in peril as she sees the two in bed together. Justin awakes and makes up an excuse that he is Andrew's lab partner. Justin then wakes Andrew up and Bree asks to see him downstairs. Andrew comes down and Bree tells Andrew that if Justin does not leave she will call the police. Andrew warns her if she does that he will inform the police that she \\"murdered\\" George Williams. Bree believes her son is not prone to blackmail but to be safe, she visits Karl Mayer who is happy to represent Bree. That afternoon, Bree, Andrew and her lawyer Karl have a discussion about Bree's involvement in George's death. He tells Andrew that because there is no law in not interfering with a suicide Bree will not be put on charges. Andrew thinks that is unfair but will lie instead. Bree warns Andrew that if he lies, she will sue him. Karl asks Bree to leave the room and he puts Andrew up against a wall and tells him that if he keeps treating his mother with disrespect he will come over and \\"take care of him\\" by violence. Bree smiles from the kitchen as she sips another glass of wine. Betty and Matthew argue over how Caleb wants his freedom and is becoming increasingly restless. Betty reminds Matthew that if he was not so preoccupied with other things maybe he could keep him company. She also tells him that she thinks they may have termites which are destroying the basement stairs. After Betty and Matthew leave, Curt Monroe who is in a car across the street plans to enter the residence to take Caleb hostage. When he finds Caleb he tells him not to be afraid and then punches him. He goes back upstairs to get his gun only to fall through the stairs as his gun goes off. Monroe dies shortly after as Caleb looks on. Betty and Matthew arrive home to find Caleb eating ice cream. Caleb tells them that he didn't do it. They find Monroe hanging from the stairs. They find out that he is from Illinois. When his cell phone rings the caller ID says \\"FOSTER\\" and they become suspicious and Betty decides they need to get rid of the body. They dispose of the body in his car but when Matthew leaves the keys in the trunk, they are forced to keep the car parked on the street. While Zach is asleep, Paul finds in his wastebasket a set of bowling scores from the day prior. Paul runs to Mike's house where he knocks him down and tells him to stay away from his son. Mike then punches back. Susan witnesses the whole thing while driving and accidentally crashes into Curt Monroe's car. The neighbors begin to gather as Alberta Fromme shrieks at the dead body in the car. After the police arrive, the women gather to think of who the murderer was. Edie thinks that the Applewhites are too mysterious and that it may have been them. The ladies wave to them and Betty tells Matthew that she is now worried.

Jeffries was transported for seven years from Dorset on , arriving in Van Diemen's Land on 21 October 1823. He was sentenced to 12 months in Macquarie Harbour, the penal settlement on the colony's west coast in June 1824 for threatening to stab Constable Lawson.Thomas Jeffries convict No. 3634, conduct record, State Archives of Tasmania. By August 1825 he had been appointed a watch house keeper and flagellator (flogger) at Launceston Gaol. Crimes Jeffries was a violent sexual offender, and on 25 August 1825 was fined half of his salary for falsely imprisoning and assaulting Mrs Jessop. In October he was fined 20 shillings for taking a female prisoner out of the watch house. On 31 December 1825, Jeffries and three convicts, Perry, Russell, and Hopkins, escaped from the Launceston Watch House. They robbed the hut of a Mr Barnard, then broke into the house of a settler called Tibbs, about five miles from Launceston. Tibbs's wife and five-month-old child and a neighbour called Basham were at the house. When they tried to tie the men up, they resisted. Basham was shot and killed, and Tibbs wounded. The bushrangers left, taking Mrs Tibbs and the baby. When Mrs Tibbs could not keep up, Jeffries grabbed the baby and bashed its head against a tree, killing it.Colonial Times, 6 January 1826 The baby's remains, which had been partly eaten by animals, were discovered about a week afterwards in the bush. Mrs Tibbs returned home on Sunday afternoon. The newspapers were coy about her state, but it is likely she had been raped. According to Mrs Tibbs, Jeffries was calling himself \\"Captain\\", and was dressed in a long black coat, a red waistcoat, and a kangaroo skin cap.Hobart Town Gazette, 29 April 1826 During their escape from Launceston, the four convicts ran out of food, whereupon they turned on Russell, killed him and ate part of his body. According to the Hobart Town Gazette of 27 January 1826, when asked what he then did with the remainder of Russell's corpse, Jeffries said it was cut into steaks and fried up with the mutton from a sheep they stole. On 11 January 1826, Jeffries shot Magnus Bakie or Baker, a constable from George Town, through the head.Jeffries, conduct record For a brief period Jeffries ran with Matthew Brady's gang, but Brady, who was unfailingly chivalrous to women, could not tolerate Jeffries' sexual crimes, and expelled him, calling him \\"a de- humanised monster\\". Capture and death Jeffries in 1826 Jeffries was captured on 23 January 1826 on the bank of the South Esk river near Evandale, Tasmania without a fight by John Batman and his posse. When he was brought to Launceston the population turned in the hope of lynching him. Safely in jail, he willingly told the authorities all he knew of the locations, movements and habits of other bushrangers. This kept him in Launceston until fellow bushrangers were caught. When Brady heard about this he had to be argued out of leading his gang in a frontal assault on the Launceston lockup, freeing all the prisoners, dragging Jeffries out and flogging him to death. Not that it mattered – Brady was caught weeks later by Batman aided by information Jeffries had passed on. On 27 March 1826 arrived at Hobart from Launceston. She was carrying five bushrangers: Matthew Brady, Goodwin, Bryant, Thomas Jeffries, and Perry.\\"SHIP NEWS\\" Colonial Times and Tasmanian Advertiser 31 March 1826 Page 2. Jeffries was hanged on 4 May 1826 at the old Hobart Jail alongside Brady on the infamous six-man scaffold. Brady complained about being executed in such poor company.

She was created by the series creators David Lynch and Mark Frost and portrayed by Sheryl Lee. Introduced in the fourth episode of the first season, Maddy is Laura Palmer's cousin who comes to Twin Peaks to help her aunt and uncle cope with the death of their daughter. Over the course of the series, Maddy forms a close friendship with Donna Hayward and James Hurley, Laura's closest friends, and assists them in their investigation into her death. Originally, she was not intended to be a part of the series but was created by David Lynch so that Lee could have a larger role in the series. Appearances =In television= In Twin Peaks, Maddy first appears midway through the first season, when she travels to Twin Peaks from her hometown of Missoula, Montana (David Lynch's birthplace). She comes to comfort her uncle and aunt, Leland and Sarah Palmer, after the death of their daughter Laura. Maddy is four years older than Laura, but otherwise looks identical apart from her dark hair and glasses. She remarks that she and Laura used to pretend they were sisters. Despite their resemblance, the innocent and sweet Maddy stands in stark contrast to Laura, whose personal life is steeped in deception. Like Laura's mother and Laura herself, Maddy has premonitions, including one of a bloodstain on the floor of the Palmers' living room and another of BOB, a demonic entity plaguing the town. Maddy quickly befriends Donna Hayward and James Hurley, Laura's closest friends, and helps them in their investigation into Laura's death. At one point, Maddy even wears a blonde wig to lure one of Laura's acquaintances. During the second season, Maddy begins to resemble her cousin more and more: her hair (though still dark) straightens, she stops wearing her glasses, and in her carriage and demeanor she behaves more like Laura as seen in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me than the Maddy of the first season. This causes conflict with Donna and James when James becomes attracted to her and she begins to return his feelings in spite of herself. Later, she is murdered by Leland Palmer, who is possessed by BOB, in a violent recreation of Laura's murder. Maddy's death quickly leads to Leland's arrest. A doppelgänger of Maddy later appears to Dale Cooper in the Black Lodge, warning him to \\"watch out for my cousin\\". =In literature= Maddy is referenced numerous times in Jennifer Lynch's novel The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer. Conception Originally, Sheryl Lee was supposed to only portray Laura Palmer. However, after David Lynch filmed a few scenes with her, he was so impressed that he created the role of Maddy so that Lee could have a larger role in the series. Reception In Cult Pop Culture: How the Fringe Became Mainstream, Bob Batchelor states \\"Through Maddy, the audience is given a chance to view a more innocent, less world-weary Laura Palmer, one that is haunted only by the question of which boy to kiss as she tries to help solve the murder.\\" In Twin Peaks FAQ: All That's Left to Know About a Place Both Wonderful and Strange David Bushman and Arthur Smith note the impact of Maddy's death, stating: :\\"Maddy emerges as perhaps Twin Peaks most tragic murder victim figure-unlike Laura, Maddy has a chance to connect with the audience over the course of many episodes...\\" :\\"It's the single most traumatic sequence in a show that never feared to confront the most lurid and depraved aspects of human nature, and one of the most disturbing murder scenes in the history of the medium. The death of Maddy Ferguson reestablished the seriousness of the stakes in the story of Twin Peaks; however eccentric, campy, and absurd the show could be, it derived from a deep undercurrent of sadness and outrage at the evil that men do.\\" See also * Laura Palmer References External links * Madeleine Ferguson Twin Peaks card * Maddy Ferguson at Twin Peaks (wiki) Category:Twin Peaks characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1990 Category:Fictional characters from Montana Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Maddy Ferguson"},{"id":"3435998","text":"KIMA may refer to: * KIMA-TV, a television station (channel 29) licensed to Yakima, Washington, United States * KIMA Wireless Technologies, a manufacturer of wireless audio transmitters * Korea Studies in Media Arts, which hosts the annual Korean American Film Festival in San Francisco ","title":"KIMA"},{"id":"3435999","text":"Location of Hroubovice in the Czech Republic Hroubovice is a village in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic.

It includes both, the right to try and prosecute individuals for criminal offences that are committed within its borders, as well as the right to arrest and apprehend individuals within its territory. The corollary is that the principle also bars states from exercising jurisdiction within the territory of other states without their express consent, unless such an exercise can be based on other principles of jurisdiction, such as the principle of nationality, the passive personality principle, the protective principle, and possibly, the principle of universal jurisdiction. The Lotus case was a key court ruling on the territoriality principle. In 1926, a French vessel collided with a Turkish vessel, causing the death of several Turkish nationals. The Permanent Court of International Justice ruled, by a bare majority, that Turkey had jurisdiction to try the French naval lieutenant for criminal negligence, even though the incident happened beyond Turkey's boundaries. This case extended the territoriality principle to cover cases that happen outside a state's boundaries, but have a substantial effect on the state's interests or involve its citizens. Questions have surfaced regarding how the territoriality principle applies, with the rise of globalization and the Internet. The applicability of this principle also was in question, with the case against Augusto Pinochet and other cases of transnational justice.

Glennies Creek Dam was created through enabling legislation enacted through the passage of the . The Act appropriated AU$30 million as the estimated cost of construction of the dam. Location and features Commenced in August 1980 and completed in June 1983, the Glennies Creek Dam is a minor dam on Glennies Creek, a tributary of the Hunter River, located approximately north of Singleton and upstream of the confluence of Glennies Creek with the Hunter River. The dam was built by Citra Constructions Limited on behalf of the NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation and the NSW Department of Water Resources to supply water for the town of Singleton, as well as irrigation, flood mitigation, and for coal mining. The dam wall height is and the arch crest is long. The maximum water depth is and at 100% capacity the dam wall holds back of water at AHD. The surface area of Lake Saint Clair is and the catchment area is . The uncontrolled rockcut spillway is capable of discharging . A high control tower with variable level inlets allows for the control of the quality and temperature of water released from the dam. Glennies Creek Dam is operated in conjunction with Glenbawn Dam. The two dams supply water requirements along of the Hunter River from Glenbawn to the tidal reaches near Maitland. Glennies Creek Dam spillway is an unlined cutting in welded ash flow tuff which supplied the entire rock fill requirement for the construction of the dam embankment. The spillway excavation was designed to be located entirely in welded tuff and not to encroach on either the underlying non-welded tuff or the overlying sandstone, both of these rock types being much inferior to the welded tuff as a rock fill construction material. The Glennies Creek and the Glennies Creek Dam are both named after James Glennie, a former naval captain who was granted creek frontage land near the Hunter River junction in 1824.

Rieth's military service began in 1980. He received his commission as a Second Lieutenant through the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps. He earned his pilot's wings at Fort Rucker, Alabama in July 1981. Prior to being appointed as Adjutant General of New Jersey, Rieth was Director of the State Army Aviation Office for the New Jersey Army National Guard. On January 3, 2006, Governor-elect Jon Corzine announced he would re-appoint Major General Rieth to another term as Adjutant General in his administration.Corzine Names Secretary of State and Military and Veterans Affairs Adjutant General , press release dated January 3, 2006. Rieth was an Army helicopter pilot for four years before joining New Jersey's National Guard as an active duty officer. His father, Kenneth Rieth, was the state's deputy adjutant general in the Democratic administration of Jim Florio. The elder Rieth retired in 1991 as a Brigadier General. The younger Rieth's father-in-law, G. Bruce Eveland, reportedly recommended that then-Governor McGreevey, hire Rieth, according to Jack McGreevey, father of the former governor and a longtime friend of Eveland.Where politics and preparedness meet uneasily. Woolley, W. (2003, November 25). Star-Ledger. Adjutant General Glenn Rieth was appointed Adjutant General in 2002 by Governor James E. McGreevey and confirmed by the New Jersey Senate on March 4, 2002. He held the post until resigning in December 2011 in a scandal over his relationship with a female subordinate. On January 15, 2010, Governor-elect Chris Christie announced he would re-appoint Major General Rieth for another term as Adjutant General. Both had been raised in Livingston and their families knew each other. Major General Rieth served under both Democratic and Republican governors spanning the administrations of McGreevey, Corzine, and Christie, as well as Richard Codey. On December 1, 2011, however, Reith resigned, effective December 15, 2011, after having had an affair with a female co-worker, a government official said. After leaving the adjutant general's position, Rieth was employed as deputy director of the Mercer County Parks Commission.

The law code covered the region of the Frisians. The Frisians were divided into four legal classes, to whom the law, or those transgressions of it that incurred set fines, applied. They were the nobles, the freemen, the serfs and slaves. The clergy are not mentioned in the Lex Frisionum as they were not liable to civil law. The Frisians received the title of freemen and were allowed to choose their own podestat or imperial governor. In the Lex Frisionum three districts of Frisia are clearly distinguished: the law governs all of Frisia, but West Frisia \\"between Zwin and Vlie\\" and East Frisia \\"between Lauwers and Weser\\" have certain stated exceptional provisions. At the partition treaty of Verdun (843) the whole of Frisia became part of Lotharingia; at the treaty of Meersen (870) it was briefly divided between the kingdoms of the East Franks (Austrasia) and the West Franks (Neustria), but in 808 the whole country was reunited under Austrasia. The first twenty-two chapters of the Lex Frisionum are entirely concerned with schedules of fines (compositio) and wergeld, the compensations due victims or their kin, scheduled according to the social ranks of perpetrator and victim. Remarkably, the fine for killing a woman was exactly the same as for a man of the same rank, a feature of Frisian law that links it to Anglo-Saxon law, and stands apart from all other German codes. A further eleven chapters contain the 'Additions of the Wise Men' (Additio sapientum), ten subheadings from the judgements of Wiemar and of Saxmund of whom nothing is known, as well as sections from the Lex Thuringorum (\\"Law Code of the Thuringians\\") to cover instances not previously covered. A noble's defense was to gather a specified number of \\"oath-helpers\\" willing to swear that the crime was not committed. The only trial by ordeal mentioned (twice) in the Lex Frisionum is the ordeal by boiling water. A stone had to be withdrawn from a seething cauldron: if the blisters were healed within three days, the man was innocent. Transmission On numismatic grounds based on the amounts of fines (compositio) and wergeld, the laws from the Lex Frisionum date from the first half of the 7th century at the latest. There are no surviving manuscripts of the Lex Frisionum. The only testimony is the oldest printed version, which dates from 1557. In that year, the scholar Joannis Basilius Herold made a compilation of all Germanic laws from the time of Charlemagne, Originum ac Germanicarum Antiquitatum Libri..., printed by Heinrich Petri of Basel. Among them was printed the Lex Frisionum, but from what source, or how corrupted was Herold's text, is unknown; the title-page of his edition indicates that the material was drawn from the library (now dispersed) of the monastery of Fulda. The surviving version is apparently a rough draft, still retaining pagan elements, which doubtless would have been edited out in the finished version, which Charlemagne apparently contemplated assembling for each of the Germanic peoples in his empire.

The station is owned by Cumulus Broadcasting and airs a classic hits radio format, switching to all-Christmas music from mid-November to December 25. KCMO-FM's studios and offices are located in the Corporate Woods area in Overland Park, Kansas. The transmitter is off Menown Avenue in Independence, Missouri. KCMO-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format, with its HD2 signal airing an adult hits format, known as \\"102.5 Jack FM,\\" which is simulcast on 250 watt translator K273BZ at 102.5 MHz. The talk radio format of AM sister station KCMO is carried on KCMO-FM's HD3 subchannel. History =Early years= One of the first FM stations in Kansas City, KCMO-FM signed on as KCFM in February 1948. It simulcast 810 AM, at the time the frequency of KCMO (AM). During the \\"Golden Age of Radio,\\" the stations aired ABC Radio Network dramas, comedies, news, sports, game shows, soap operas and big band broadcasts. The KCMO-FM call sign was granted in 1950, the first of several times the station would go by that call sign. The Meredith Corporation bought KCMO-AM-FM in 1953. On July 23, 1959, as the days of network programming ended, KCMO-AM-FM adopted a full service, middle of the road (MOR) personality format. =Beautiful music= On March 16, 1968, KCMO- FM separated its programming from 810 AM, and began airing a mostly instrumental beautiful music format as KCMU. In 1974, the station began adding a few vocals to the format and switched its call letters to KCEZ, \\"EZ 95\\". In 1983, The Meredith Corporation, which had owned KCMO-AM-FM since 1953, sold both stations to Richard Fairbanks, a one-time owner of what is now WXIA-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, and the head of Fairbanks Broadcasting. =Country music and Top 40= On October 10, 1983, the station adopted a country music format as \\"KC 95.\\"\\"Goodbye, beautiful music; howdy, country at KCEZ\\", The Kansas City Star, October 11, 1983. The KCMO-FM call letters returned in 1984. The station gained attention when one of its billboards appeared in a Psychedelic Furs music video. Fairbanks sold both stations in 1985 to the Summit Communications Group. Summit changed KCMO-FM to a dance-leaning Top 40 format as KBKC, \\"B95\\", on July 26, 1985.Barry Garron, \\"KCMO-FM dropping country\\", The Kansas City Star, July 11, 1985. The Gannett Company bought the station in 1986, shifting to a more adult-friendly mainstream Top 40 format as \\"Power 95 KCPW,\\" on August 25 of that year.\\"KBKC-FM tries on new call letters\\", The Kansas City Star, August 28, 1986.Barry Garron, \\"KBKC-FM looks for mass appeal\\", The Kansas City Star, August 5, 1986. =Switch to oldies= On July 28, 1989, at 5 p.m., after playing \\"Don't Wanna Lose You\\" by Gloria Estefan, KCPW flipped to an oldies format as \\"Oldies 95,\\" with the third use of the KCMO-FM call sign, acquired days before the switch. The first song on \\"Oldies 95\\" was \\"Kansas City\\" by Wilbert Harrison.Barry Garron, \\"Power-95 switches to an oldies format\\", The Kansas City Star, July 31, 1989. Another oldies station serving Kansas City, 710 WHB, saw most of its listeners switch over to KCMO-FM in a matter of months, prompting that station's conversion to farm radio. KCMO-FM Logo 1989-2005 In 1993, Gannett sold KCMO-AM-FM to Bonneville International, which also owned KMBZ and KLTH (now KZPT). Four years later, Bonneville sold all four of its Kansas City stations together with three radio stations in Seattle to Entercom Communications. =Cumulus ownership= Susquehanna Radio bought KCMO-AM-FM from Entercom in 2000, as Entercom was forced to sell the KCMO stations after its purchase of Sinclair Broadcast Group's radio stations KQRC-FM, KXTR-FM and KCIY. That left Entercom with two stations over the Federal Communications Commission's single-market ownership limit. Susquehanna subsequently merged with Cumulus Media in mid-2006. KCMO-FM enjoyed strong ratings throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, but in 2005 it became concerned that the name \\"oldies\\" appealed to older listeners, less attractive to advertisers. Ratings weren't an issue, as the station was often in the Top 10. The station dropped its \\"oldies\\" moniker in April 2005 and began calling its music \\"Greatest Hits\\", playing only mid-'60s to early-'80s music. In the mid-2010s, KCMO began playing hits from the early 1990s, and scaled back music recorded before the 1970s. KCMO-FM HD2 On February 14, 2011, the station turned on its HD2 sub-channel and launched an all-comedy format branded as \\"Funny 102.5.\\" It is also heard on translator station K273BZ (102.5 FM), hence the 102.5 in the moniker.https://radioinsight.com/headlines/netgnomes/32308/whats-funny-in- kansas-city/ On January 2, 2013, 102.5 FM flipped to sports talk, branded as \\"102.5 The Fan.\\"https://radioinsight.com/headlines/80039/cumulus-to- launch-102-5-the-fan-kansas-city/ On August 15, 2014, at 3 p.m., the station abruptly dropped the sports format in the middle of a sports update, and began a 7-minute countdown. After the countdown, 102.5/94.9-HD2 became one of the first network affiliates of the new Cumulus-owned \\"Nash Icon\\" format as 102.5 Nash Icon, playing country hits from the 1980s, 90s and early 2000s. \\"Nash Icon\\" began with \\"Wagon Wheel\\" by Darius Rucker.https://radioinsight.com/headlines/netgnomes/89681/cumulus-prepping- nash-icons-format-launch/ On November 2, 2015, at midnight, after playing \\"You Ain't Much Fun\\" by Toby Keith, 102.5/94.9-HD2 changed its format to alternative rock, branded as \\"102.5 The Underground\\", beginning with \\"Kansas City\\" by The New Basement Tapes. With the change, 102.5/94.9-HD2 became the first Nash/Nash Icon station to drop the format. On June 15, 2016, at 7:30 a.m., after playing \\"Up & Up\\" by Coldplay, 102.5/94.9-HD2 swapped formats with co-owned KCJK, adopting that station's adult hits format, and rebranded as \\"102.5 Jack FM\\", while the alternative format moved to KCJK.

He is called on his death notice in the Annals of Ulster, \\"Máel Snechtai m.

Perhaps then the events of Máel Snechtai's death caused some kind of identity disassociation between the Men of Moray and the Men of Scotland. The Anglo- Saxon Chronicle, s.a. 1078, reports that \\"In this year Máel Coluim seized the mother of Máel Snechtai ...and all his treasures, and his cattle; and he himself escaped [only] with difficulty.\\" The ... represents a lacuna in the text one line long;A.O.

Grant, \\"The Province of Ross\\", p. 103. that Máel Snechtai subsequently retired to a monastery is based only on textual innuendo, and is made unlikely by the fact that he was called \\"King of Moray\\" on his death. Máel Snechtai, as the son of King Lulach, undoubtedly perceived himself as the rightful king of Scotland, and the already noted conflict with Máel Coluim III strongly suggests that he pursued his claim. His death date is based on the year given by the Annals of Ulster, s.a. 1085.

The church was constructed as the hospital chapel of the Hospital of St Giles and was dedicated in on St Barbara's Day, June 1112 by Bishop Flambard to \\"the honour of God and St Giles\\". The church became caught up in an 1140 dispute over the bishopric of Durham following the usurpation of the diocese by William Cumin, Chancellor of King David I of Scotland. William of St. Barbara, the rightly elected Bishop, was forced to retreat to, and fortify, the church after his abortive entry into Durham was beaten back by Cumin's men. In response Cumin's men destroyed the hospital, which was later refounded at nearby Kepier. Bishop Puiset later extended the church to reflect its role at the centre of a growing parish, and the current font is believed to date from this time. The church was appropriated to Kepier Hospital which acted as rector, receiving tithes and with the advowson (right to appoint a vicar), appointing a parochial chaplain to minister to the needs of the parish. John Heath, the Elizabethan owner of the Kepier estates, Gilesgate and Old Durham is buried in the church. The ecclesiastical parish of St Giles was divided in 1852 with the creation of a new Belmont parish, served from church of St Mary Magdalene, Belmont and covering Belmont, Gilesgate Moor and New Durham. St Giles Church retains some of Flambard's original building (primarily the north wall) and most of Puiset's additions. Minor restoration and three large windows inserted into the south wall in 1828. The church was restored and extended in 1873-1876 as the parish continued to grow. The Revd Canon Dr Alan B. Bartlett is the current vicar of St Giles since Summer 2008.

Although a conventional design its combination of light weight, mobility, heavy firepower and range saw its features widely copied by successive generations of mortars. Design M1938 on its limber attached to a caisson The origins of the M1938 lay in the French Mortier Brandt de 120mm Modele 1935 and the Brandt mle 27/31 which the Soviet Union produced under license as the 82-PM-36. In 1937 the Soviets produced a modified version of the 82-PM-36 known as the 82-PM-37 and this mortar served as the pattern for the 120-PM-38. The main difference between the 82-PM-37 and the earlier 82-PM-36 was the adoption of a round base-plate, revised traverse/elevation controls, simplified sights and spring-loaded shock absorbers on the bi-pod to reduce the amount of relaying needed between shots. The 120-PM-38 is essentially a scaled up 82-PM-37 which uses the same two- wheeled limber as the 107 mm PBHM-38. The limber works in much the same way as a hand truck. The limber is wheeled vertically into place, hooks on the base- plate hook onto the limber, the barrel is clamped down and then everything is lowered into towing position. The limber can either be towed directly or attached to a 20-round caisson for towing by a vehicle or horse team. Employment The 120-PM-38 was typically deployed to support infantry units and is the heaviest weapon that can still be broken down and transported by soldiers on foot. At first the 120-PM-38 was employed at the regimental level for indirect fire support in place of artillery, but as World War II continued it was issued down to the battalion level to supplement lighter mortars. Getting the 120-PM-38 into and out of action was relatively rapid, so batteries were often moved to avoid counter-battery fire. Due to its rate of fire and large shell a battery of four mortars could lay down a heavy amount of fire in a short period of time, which was useful for hit and run tactics. Another useful feature was the circular base-plate which allowed for changes in traverse without the need to dig out the base-plate and realign the barrel. Later 120-PM-43 mortars had a larger single shock absorber on the bi-pod to counteract the tendency of the base-plate to dig in on soft ground. 120-PM-43 mortars were kept in production long after World War II and sold to many Soviet client states. Both have seen widespread use in conflicts from World War II until today. During the early phases of Operation Barbarossa the Germans captured large quantities of Soviet hardware including the 120-PM-38 which they designated the 12 cm Granatwerfer 378(r). After being on the receiving end of the 120-PM-38's firepower they adopted it to supplement their own mortars and eventually produced a modified version called the 12 cm Granatwerfer 42. The Granatwerfer 42 was widely issued to German units and often took the place of infantry guns later in the war. The Finnish and Romanians also made use of captured stocks of Soviet weapons and eventually the Romanians also created their own design, the Reșița Model 1942, produced at the Reșița Works with a rate of 80 pieces per month as of October 1942.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941–1945, p. 75 , it was in service in Moldova, Russian Federation, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.

To do this, liquid waste is poured into artificial, shallow ponds. The waste is heated by solar radiation and any moisture is evaporated, leaving behind the waste. These ponds contained low level radioactive process waste as well as sanitary sewage sludge and wastes, which categorize them and the Pondcrete as a mixed waste. Rocky Flats Plant - Aerial View 002 Room damaged by 1969 Rocky Flats Fire Leaking drum from pad 903 Radioactive waste Because the blocks were classified as mixed-level radioactive waste, including plutonium, Rockwell International was unable to store the blocks in the Nevada Test site. The Nevada Test Site did not have a permit to store mixed-level radioactive waste, so the blocks were left in temporary storage at Rocky Flats. Due to problems in production, many of the blocks did not harden correctly and eventually began to seep from the boxes causing large scale environmental contamination of the area. The blocks containing plutonium-239, radioactive waste with a half-life of 24,100 years, had failed in a year. Despite warnings by engineer Jim Stone that the blocks would most likely fail earlier than expected, the blocks were still produced. Later it would be Jim Stone who would file a lawsuit against the company, claiming that they had concealed environmental, safety and health problems from the United States Department of Energy. Investigation The contaminations led to an investigation of the Plant by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Environmental Protection Agency which eventually resulted in its shutdown. In 1993, Federal Judge Sherman Finesilver, approved the release of the Colorado Federal District Court Special Grand Jury Report on the investigation. The report found that the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency oversight were not performed adequately to protect the environment, and that Rockwell did not comply with environmental laws at the Rocky Flats Plant. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) and Rockwell violated the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) by illegally storing, treating and disposing of residues in more than 17,000 of blocks of pondcrete and saltcrete in plastic lined cardboard containers outdoors on the 904 Pad at the plant. Each pondcrete block containing mixed-wastes (radioactive, cadmium, methylene chloride and acetone) weighed between 1,500 and 1,800 pounds. These blocks did not sufficiently harden like concrete, maintaining a consistency of wet clay. Many of the boxes ruptured, possibly due to extreme temperature fluctuations in that region of Colorado, spilling these wastes onto the asphalt pad at Site 904. Rain and wind carried these wastes into drainage areas and into the air and soil.

This image shows an early, experimental tool. Extreme ultraviolet radiation (EUV or XUV) or high-energy ultraviolet radiation is electromagnetic radiation in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum spanning wavelengths from 124 nm down to 10 nm, and therefore (by the Planck–Einstein equation) having photons with energies from 10 eV up to 124 eV (corresponding to 124 nm to 10 nm respectively). EUV is naturally generated by the solar corona and artificially by plasma and synchrotron light sources. Since UVC extends to 100 nm, there is some overlap in the terms. The main uses of extreme ultraviolet radiation are photoelectron spectroscopy, solar imaging, and lithography. In air, EUV is the most highly absorbed component of the electromagnetic spectrum, requiring high vacuum for transmission. EUV generation Neutral atoms or condensed matter cannot emit EUV radiation. Ionization must take place first. EUV light can only be emitted by electrons which are bound to multicharged positive ions; for example, to remove an electron from a +3 charged carbon ion (three electrons already removed) requires about 65 eV. Such electrons are more tightly bound than typical valence electrons. The existence of multicharged positive ions is only possible in a hot dense plasma. Alternatively, the free electrons and ions may be generated temporarily and instantaneously by the intense electric field of a very-high-harmonic laser beam. The electrons accelerate as they return to the parent ion, releasing higher energy photons at diminished intensities, which may be in the EUV range. If the released photons constitute ionizing radiation, they will also ionize the atoms of the harmonic-generating medium, depleting the sources of higher-harmonic generation. The freed electrons escape since the electric field of the EUV light is not intense enough to drive the electrons to higher harmonics, while the parent ions are no longer as easily ionized as the originally neutral atoms. Hence, the processes of EUV generation and absorption (ionization) strongly compete against each other. However, in 2011 Shambhu Ghimire et al. first observed high-harmonic generation in bulk crystal ZnO. It draws interest to invest the possibility and mechanism of HHG in solid state. EUV radiation can be emitted in SiO2 or Saphhire. =Direct tunable generation of EUV= EUV light can also be emitted by free electrons orbiting a synchrotron. Continuously tunable narrowband EUV light can be generated by four wave mixing in gas cells of krypton and hydrogen to wavelengths as low as 110 nm. In windowless gas chambers fixed four wave mixing has been seen as low as 75 nm. EUV absorption in matter When an EUV photon is absorbed, photoelectrons and secondary electrons are generated by ionization, much like what happens when X-rays or electron beams are absorbed by matter. The response of matter to EUV radiation can be captured in the following equations: Point of absorption: EUV photon energy=92 eV=Electron binding energy + photoelectron initial kinetic energy; within 3 mean free paths of photoelectron (1–2 nm): reduction of photoelectron kinetic energy=ionization potential + secondary electron kinetic energy; within 3 mean free paths of secondary electron (~30 nm): 1) reduction of secondary electron kinetic energy=ionization potential + tertiary electron kinetic energy, 2)mNth generation electron slows down aside from ionization by heating (phonon generation), 3) final generation electron kinetic energy ~ 0 eV => dissociative electron attachment + heat, where the ionization potential is typically 7–9 eV for organic materials and 4–5 eV for metals. The photoelectron subsequently causes the emission of secondary electrons through the process of impact ionization. Sometimes, an Auger transition is also possible, resulting in the emission of two electrons with the absorption of a single photon. Strictly speaking, photoelectrons, Auger electrons and secondary electrons are all accompanied by positively charged holes (ions which can be neutralized by pulling electrons from nearby molecules) in order to preserve charge neutrality. An electron-hole pair is often referred to as an exciton. For highly energetic electrons, the electron-hole separation can be quite large and the binding energy is correspondingly low, but at lower energy, the electron and hole can be closer to each other. The exciton itself diffuses quite a large distance (>10 nm). As the name implies, an exciton is an excited state; only when it disappears as the electron and hole recombine, can stable chemical reaction products form. Since the photon absorption depth exceeds the electron escape depth, as the released electrons eventually slow down, they dissipate their energy ultimately as heat. EUV wavelengths are absorbed much more strongly than longer wavelengths, since their corresponding photon energies exceed the bandgaps of all materials. Consequently, their heating efficiency is significantly higher, and has been marked by lower thermal ablation thresholds in dielectric materials.A. Ritucci et al., \\"Damage and ablation of large band gap dielectrics induced by a 46.9 nm laser beam\\", March 9, 2006 report UCRL-JRNL-219656 (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). =Solar minima/maxima= Certain wavelengths of EUV vary by as much as 2 orders of magnitude between solar minima and maxima, and therefore may contribute to climatic changes, notably the cooling of the atmosphere during solar minimum. EUV damage Like other forms of ionizing radiation, EUV and electrons released directly or indirectly by the EUV radiation are a likely source of device damage. Damage may result from oxide desorption or trapped charge following ionization. Damage may also occur through indefinite positive charging by the Malter effect. If free electrons cannot return to neutralize the net positive charge, positive ion desorption is the only way to restore neutrality. However, desorption essentially means the surface is degraded during exposure, and furthermore, the desorbed atoms contaminate any exposed optics. EUV damage has already been documented in the CCD radiation aging of the Extreme UV Imaging Telescope (EIT). Radiation damage is a well- known issue that has been studied in the process of plasma processing damage. A recent study at the University of Wisconsin Synchrotron indicated that wavelengths below 200 nm are capable of measurable surface charging.J. L. Shohet, http://pptl.engr.wisc.edu/Nuggets%20v9a.ppt EUV radiation showed positive charging centimeters beyond the borders of exposure while VUV (Vacuum Ultraviolet) radiation showed positive charging within the borders of exposure. Studies using EUV femtosecond pulses at the Free Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) indicated thermal melting-induced damage thresholds below 100 mJ/cm2.R. Sobierajski et al., http://hasyweb.desy.de/science/annual_reports/2006_report/part1/contrib/40/17630.pdf An earlier study showed that electrons produced by the 'soft' ionizing radiation could still penetrate ~100 nm below the surface, resulting in heating.

Tungsten film was developed for photographers who use tungsten lights, also known as photofloods, which have a much lower color temperature than daylight, at 3200 kelvins. It also renders colors more accurately than daylight film under ordinary household incandescent lighting. On daylight-balanced film tungsten lighting produces a spectrally accurate rendition of a scene; but human vision adjusts to the color of the lighting and perceives colors as if under daylight, seeing a spectrally accurate image as having a yellow-orange cast. Tungsten film is balanced in such a way that this lighting is recorded with a subjectively neutral color balance. When shot outdoors, tungsten film produces a strong blue cast, an effect which is often used purposely to create different color contrasts. In the motion picture industry the use of underexposed tungsten-balanced film in an outdoor setting is a common way of producing a \\"day for night\\" effect, whereby film shot during the daytime looks as if it had been shot at night. Tungsten slide films are designed to provide accurate exposure as well as color rendition even when exposed according to exposure meter readings indicating a long exposure; tungsten film can be used to avoid reciprocity failure which often occurs when using long exposures. Common film speeds for tungsten-balanced slide film are ISO 64, 160, and 320. Examples * Cinestill 800t * Kodak 500t References *Hedgecoe, John. The New Manual of Photography. 1st ed.

A dance belt is a kind of specialized undergarment commonly worn by male ballet dancers to support their genitals. Most are similar in design to thong underwear. Dance belts were originally developed in the early 1900s for male dancers to wear during training and performances because # vigorous choreographic movements subject their external genitalia - when not otherwise supported, restrained and cradled snugly against the lower groin area - to loose, unrestrained instability (i.e. flopping around) due to rapid acceleration, deceleration and gravity forces (because as the body temperature warms up during physical exertion, the scrotal skin naturally loosens, relaxes and droops down in order to moderate the testes at a lower temperature level (or shrinks and contracts when subject to cold to maintain a warmer temperature)); where such floppy movements of the male appendage can be distracting to the dancer. # skin-tight, body-hugging ballet tights would otherwise reveal the contours of the male dancer's genitalia to a degree of detail considered distracting and immodest to the viewer; male ballet costumes from the lower torso down to the feet evolved from short breeches worn over leggings to just leggings alone. A dance belt resembles a thong undergarment in design but has a wider waist belt so the flesh at the waist is not pinched in. At the back this waist belt is connected to the bottom of the front triangular panel that covers and supports the male genital parts by a very narrow piece of elasticized fabric. This strip of fabric passes between the wearer's legs and is recessed in the intergluteal cleft, the crevice formed by the two buttocks (also called a \\"natal cleft\\" ) and is sometimes referred to as a \\"T-back\\" design. Athletic supporters or jock straps also provide active males with anatomical support but involve a pair of elasticized straps joined to the bottom of the front pouch passing between the legs and encircling the upper thighs just below and on each side of the buttocks. The Japanese fundoshi shares some similarities with a dance belt. The color of the dancer's supporter is normally chosen to be similar to his skin tone, such as beige, dark brown or black, which is intended to make it less apparent beneath the dancer's thin, tight fitting, base outer apparel, a pair of tights perhaps worn over a type of body suit leotard. Dance belts are also produced in white, which can be dyed to any color. Some dances are choreographed and performed where the males wear only a dance belt alone. Lighter coloured tights, such as white, light grey, creme and beige can be more revealing of and make more conspicuous the delta shaped detail of the male dancer's genital area since the shape and contour of his penis tend to stand out more under bright lights for stage performance, accentuated as they are by shadowy depression and high relief. Darker tights on the other hand tend to be less revealing, especially when they have a flat, matte finish to them rather than a shiny one that catches and reflects the intense, bright stage lights more. Dance belts are quite comfortable to wear when properly sized, fitted and worn-in. When properly positioned within the garment, the male anatomical parts are held closely and firmly to the lower abdomen in a raised (pointed upward) attitude rather than in a hanging attitude as for an athletic supporter (although variations are possible for both types of genital support devices). At the same time, the waist belt material stretches, thus allowing for free, unrestricted movements required for dance. Though dance belts are classically of the T- or thong-back design, there are also designs featuring a full seat similar to brief style underwear. These types are, however, less aesthetically pleasing as they cause panty lines, which refers to the elasticized bottom edge of the seat cloth pressing lightly into the buttock flesh, so as to be noticeable beneath the tights. The front triangular support pouch can be constructed simply of a couple of layers of spandex fabric (or similar); or else there can also be a thin layer of very light non-bulky padding material incorporated in order to effect an even more smoothed, discreet bulge. Regardless, there is generally no seam down the front of the pouch as there usually is with conventional thong underwear for men, the reason being that such a seam would be visible beneath clinging tights. Dance belts can be worn by any active males desirous of support and a visually smooth and neat appearance when wearing snug, form fitting and generally stretchy clothing, for example costumes worn in dance styles other than ballet, as well as by figure skaters, trapeze artists, actors (and cosplayers) wearing skin tight super hero costumes, and equestrians. This could be for reasons that, similar to ballet dancing, relate to aesthetics (look), comfort, and testicular injury prevention. In the case of the male rider, a painful injury could result when unsupported, low-hanging testicles strike the saddle, for example as the rider raises and lowers his position while posting during a trot.

He has an active solo career, as well as his own recording studio in Tenerife, Spain. Biography =First bands (1979–1987)= Deris was born in Karlsruhe, Germany, and started to sing in his first band, Paranoid, when he was 15. Two years later, they changed the band's name to Nameless. In Nameless, Deris stayed along with his school friend, drummer Ralf Maurer, who also played on both Deris' solo albums. In late 1984, Deris joined a band called Dragon with the two brothers Bruno and Oscar Di Blasio (\\"Di Blasio BrOs\\") on guitar, and Bernd and Stefan Lüddemann (bass and drums). After playing live concerts in the Karlsruhe area, they went to Edo Zanki's studio in Karlsdorf and to Arco Studio, Munich, to record their first demo with producer Tony Monn. The following songs were recorded: \\"I Was Made to Be With You\\", \\"Call Me Up\\", \\"Woman\\", \\"I Hear the Angels Singing\\", \\"Ballade of Glory\\", and \\"Rock Your Body Down\\". During the production of the demo, drummer Bodo Schopf (ex-Michael Schenker Group) recorded some drum-parts. In 1986, when Bruno and Oscar Di Blasio, together with Deris (who had just finished military service), met Italian bass player Daniel De Niro, Kymera was born. Ralf Maurer alias \\"Ralph Mason\\" was again recruited as the new drummer of the band. Soon after, Kymera went to the Katapult-Tonstudio in Karlsruhe to record new songs for Francis, Day and Hunter GmbH Publishing. The following songs were recorded: \\"Hello U.S.A.\\", \\"Hot Looking Romeo\\", \\"Send Me a Letter\\", and rearranged versions of \\"I Was Made to Be with You\\", \\"Call Me Up\\", and \\"Woman\\". After a few concerts, Maurer quit Kymera to go to university and was replaced by a young Kosta Zafiriou, and the line-up of Kymera was complete again. Soon, the band went to a studio in Mainz to record \\"Shadows Are Falling\\", \\"Lonely Would Be Loving You\\", and a new version of \\"Ballade of Glory\\", and played many live dates in Germany until the end of 1986. In the beginning of 1987, Deris and Kosta Zafiriou left Kymera to form the band Pink Cream 69. Deris was hired for the recording sessions for No Mercy, a band-project based in Appenweier/Offenburg in South Germany, founded by three locals: Bobby Benz (bass), Rüdiger Föll (drums), and Uwe Ulm (lead guitar). He also played two gigs with No Mercy. On the second and last gig, Pink Cream 69 played as a support band for No Mercy; on that evening Deris was the lead singer for both bands and hit the stage twice, opening with the very first lineup of Pink Cream 69. =Pink Cream 69 (1987–1993)= In 1987, when Deris was 22, Pink Cream 69 was officially formed, with the original lineup of Dennis Ward, Kosta Zafiriou, Alfred Koffler and Deris. They signed with CBS (now known as Sony Music). Pink Cream toured in Europe, America and Japan, and recorded three albums with Deris on vocal duties. In 1992, they released a live video titled Size It up – Live in Japan. This hour-long concert is also featured on Pink Cream 69's 2009 live DVD Past and Present, along with all videos starring Deris as well. =Helloween and solo career (1993–present)= Deris performing with Helloween in 2006 In 1993, Helloween was undergoing lineup changes. Gone was Ingo Schwichtenberg, replaced by ex-Gamma Ray drummer Uli Kusch, and Michael Kiske, replaced by Deris. The new lineup recorded Master of the Rings. Deris immediately became a songwriter for the band, resulting in tunes like \\"Why?\\", \\"Perfect Gentleman\\" and \\"In the Middle of a Heartbeat\\". The Time of the Oath in 1996 further lifted up the band's album sales, culminating in a world tour and a concert DVD along with double-CD live album, High Live, set from three concerts in Spain and Italy. While Helloween would go on a break, Deris would record his first solo album, Come In from the Rain. Deris sang and played guitar, accompanied by Peter Idera (guitar), Ralph Maison (drums and backing vocals), and Gisbert Royder (bass). In 1998, Helloween recorded Better Than Raw in Tenerife, Spain, where he currently lives. In 1999, Helloween released the cover album Metal Jukebox and Deris' second solo album, Done by Mirrors (released in Japan; released 2000 in other parts of the world due to record company conflicts), featuring Deris once again on vocals and guitars, Don Pupillo on lead guitar, Maison and Royder. Helloween's The Dark Ride also came in 2000. After the supporting tour for The Dark Ride, Helloween fired Roland Grapow and Uli Kusch. Rabbit Don't Come Easy would be released in 2003, featuring the band's first tour in the United States since 1989. In 2005, Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy was released. The first single and video was Deris' song \\"Mrs. God\\". For the first time in the band's history, there was a duet, with Candice Night of Blackmore's Night, in the song \\"Light the Universe\\". It was the second single and the second video for the album. A live double-DVD video with documentary and live double-CD was released in February 2007. Helloween completed their twelfth studio album Gambling with the Devil, released on 23 October 2007. \\"As Long as I Fall\\", the first single, was released in early September and available only via download (save for Japan, where it was released on CD). Since then, Helloween also released Unarmed – Best of 25th Anniversary (2009), 7 Sinners (2010), Straight Out of Hell (2013), and My God-Given Right (2015), which has a title inspired by something Deris' father told him when he finished school. A new solo album was also released, called Million-Dollar Haircuts on Ten-Cent Heads, in November 2013.  Personal life  Deris has a son born in 1990 or 1991. Since the late 1990s, he has resided in Tenerife, Spain, but intends to move to the Seychelles one day. Commenting on the differences between Tenerife and Germany, Deris said: Guest appearances *Deris provided lead vocals for the song \\"To the Quasar\\", from Ayreon's 2000 album Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator. *He also appears in the Rage album, Soundchaser, in the song \\"Falling from Grace, Pt. 1: Wake the Nightmares\\". *The German Rock Stars has Andi singing on the song \\"Wings of Freedom\\". * Andi was part of the German rock project on the song \\"Let Love Conquer the World\\" *He sang with an ensemble of singers in the \\"20th Anniversary Song\\" from the band Axxis, a medley of Axxis songs. *He appeared on the Tribute to Rainbow CD with the song \\"Catch the Rainbow\\". *He sang on the track \\"Bad Mean Woman\\" at album Jail from the band Get Into.... *Together with Michael Weikath he appears on the track \\"Eagle Fly Free\\" on the DVD and live album Ritualive from the band Shaman; the song is a Helloween cover.

Its role is to immobilize hazardous waste and in some cases lower-level radioactive waste in the form of solid material. It is a form of mixed waste. Saltcrete is being replaced by saltstone, which is less permeable and leachable. Saltstone is a mixture of the salt cake (mostly sodium nitrate and other salts) with concrete and fly ash. An example of a saltcrete site in the United States is The Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) near Denver, Colorado. Between 1952 and 1992, nuclear weapons components consisting of radioactive and otherwise hazardous materials were manufactured there. By 1989, a government investigation had concluded that many of these materials were being improperly stored and handled, leading to the site being added to the National Priorities List for cleanup by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Saltcrete-related background of RFETS  In June 1997 Kaiser-Hill Company, also known as CH2M Hill, the DOE Integrating Management Contractor for RFETS, contracted with Envirocare of Utah, Inc., also known as EnergySolutions, to transport, treat and dispose of more than 13,000 cubic meters of radioactively and hazardously contaminated mixed waste, including the Saltcrete waste stream. Shipment of Saltcrete began in July 1997. The first phase of 1,705 cubic meters of the Saltcrete waste stream was successfully transported, treated and disposed in less than eight weeks. The second phase of 1,710 cubic meters was completed in the first quarter of FY98 in the same amount of time.  Introduction  Saltcrete is the result and technique of wastewater processing and was the second-largest mixed waste stream at RFETS requiring treatment and disposition. The majority of wastewater from RFETS production processes is contained in large tanks and then is treated by precipitation, filtration, evaporation, and drying to result in a matrix referred to as \\"salts\\". Original waste stream production was rich in nitrates and sulfates, therefore the reference to the dried material as salts; however, current waste stream production has an essentially decreased concentration of inorganic compounds, even though the waste is still considered to as salts. Saltcrete is formed when liquid evaporator concentrates are combined with the salts and Portland cement. The mixture is poured into cardboard and plywood containers to solidify into a monolith. The process waste water remains hazardous waste Saltcrete is a mixed radioactive waste. Radionuclide contamination principally includes americium, plutonium, and uranium. The waste carries Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,RCRA, Hazardous Waste Codes F001, F002, F005, F006, F007, and F009. RCRA contaminants include specific volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds and metals.  Treatment and formula development by the joint-venture  The mutual goal between Envirocare and Kaiser-Hill was to meet the Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement. The agreement policy was 1,575 cubic meters of non- compliant Saltcrete waste had to be removed from RFETS by September 30, 1997. After agreement award yet prior to shipment to Envirocare, a successful formula had to be developed in time to meet the specified objectives. Benchscale treatability studies were in progress by experimenting five ‘worst- case’ samples of the Saltcrete waste that were collected by Kaiser-Hill. According to the variability of RCRA Hazardous Waste constituents in the waste population, several treatability samples were required. This sample selection was required to make sure that the formula developed would be sufficiently aggressive to stabilize the hazardous elements known to be existed. Formula development services were subcontracted by Envirocare to InSciTe (a subsidiary of Mountain States Analytical Laboratory, Inc.). Formula development was involving the application of several combinations of chemical reagents in an effort to immobilize hazardous constituents. In accordance with existing permit requirements, Envirocare submitted a copy of the Treatment Formula to the State of Utah, Division of Solid and Hazardous Waste. The State retains this report for its reference. Kaiser-Hill was successful in expediting sample selection, collection and delivery to Envirocare for the analysis. Envirocare utilized rush analytical services and an accelerated schedule for result in the formula being developed in under one month. Notification for shipment was provided to Kaiser-Hill immediately upon successful formula development. Finally in 1997, Envirocare has won a $7 million contract to handle low-level mixed waste at the former Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant.  Site condition criteria  The site-related criteria are used for development of the design for the temporary Reprocessing Facility are also provided in the Process and Project Design Criteria. Numerous of the rules, regulations, guidelines, policies, etc. for a sub-contractor operated, temporary facility have a different principle than those which could be an impact or requirement for a longer-term facility. Furthermore, standards for a processing facility which could be adjusted for a higher variation of feed materials and possibly have the ability to emit different byproduct waste forms such as liquid to solid, are also seemed to be integrated. These new regulations would have to be determined and the well-fitted modifications made to the equipment design criteria, general design criteria, specifications and site-related considerations. These differences would then have to be acknowledged into the construction design. It is similarly that the site-related criteria required for the longer-term plant will not only require a more detailed engineering effort for process design, but also would require greater attention to definition of the site-related factors such as soil bearing pressure, requirements for foundations, vibrational considerations, building criteria, etc.  Disposal of Saltcrete  Treated byproduct will be placed mixed waste cell for permanent disposition. The mixed waste cell is engineered with a triple high-density polyethylene (HDPE) liner system. Collected layers between each line provide leak liquid management and leakage detection for the cell, while a foundation of engineered clay stabilizes the liner system. The waste is buried in a 7 ft clay radon barrier, a rock filter zone, and a coarse rock erosion barrier.  See also  * Pondcrete * Salt-concrete  External links and references  *1. A. Drom, K.

Sart is a name for the settled inhabitants of Central Asia and the Middle East, which has had shifting meanings over the centuries. Sarts, known sometimes as Ak-Sart in ancient times, did not have any particular ethnic identification, and were usually (though not always) town-dwellers.  Origin  There are several theories about the origin of the term. It may be derived from the Sanskrit sārthavāha \\"merchant, trader, caravan leader\\", a term supposedly used by nomads to describe town-dwellers, according to Vasily Bartold, Gerard Clauson, and most recently Richard Foltz.Golden, Peter B. An Introduction to the History of Turkic Peoples (1992). p. 150Foltz, Richard A History of the Tajiks: Iranians of the East Note 27 for Chapter 4 The earliest known use of the term is in the 1070 Turkic text Kutadgu Bilig \\"Blessed Knowledge\\", in which it refers to the settled population of Kashgaria. Then, the term apparently referred to all settled Muslims of Central Asia, regardless of language. Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in the Jami' al-tawarikh writes that Genghis Khan commanded for Arslan Khan, prince of the Karluks, to be given the title \\"Sartaqtai\\", which he considered to be synonymous with Tajik. A 13th-century Mongolian source, The Secret History of the Mongols, states that the Mongols called people from Central Asia, most notably Khwarazm, \\"Sartuul\\". \\"Sar\\" in Mongolian means \\"moon\\" so sart or sarta would mean \\"ones with (flag with) moon\\" since the Muslims had a crescent moon symbol on their flags. One of the Mongol tribes living in Zavkhan Province, Mongolia is made up of descendants of merchants from Khwarazm who resided in Kharkhorin and is still called Sartuul.  Alternative meanings  In the post-Mongol period we find that Ali-Shir Nava'i refers to the Iranian people as Sart Ulusi \\"Sart people\\", and for him Sart tili \\"Sart language\\" was a synonym for the Persian language. Similarly, when Babur refers to the people of Margilan as \\"Sarts\\", it is in distinction to the people of Andijan who are Turks, and it is clear that by this he means Persian-speakers. He also refers to the population of the towns and villages of the vilayat of Kabul as \\"Sarts\\". Similarly, Babur wrote in the Baburnama in 1525, \\"In the country of Kābul there are many and various tribes. Its valleys and plains are inhabited by Tūrks, Aimāks, and Arabs. In the city and the greater part of the villages, the population consists of Tajiks (Sarts).\\" A further change of use seems to have occurred with the arrival in the oasis regions of Turkestan of the Taza Özbek Pure ÖzbeksGolden, Peter B. An Introduction to the History of Turkic Peoples. p. 406-408 under Muhammad Shaybani. They distinguished between themselves as semi-nomadic speakers of a Fergana Kipchak language and the settled Turkic-speaking populations already living in the oasis towns, most of whom spoke the Chagatai language, one of the Karluk languages. It is at this date that the distinction between the terms Sart and Tajik seems to have made itself felt, as previously they were often used interchangeably. Even after the Uzbeks switched to a settled way of life, they continued to maintain this distinction between Turkic-speakers who were members of one of the Uzbek tribes, and Sarts, who were not. In June 2010, \\"Sart\\" was used in ethnic conflict between Kyrgyzes and Uzbeks in southern Kyrgyzstan to distinguished the less East-Asiatic Uzbeks from Kyrgyzes.  Development of Ethnic identity in Central Asia  Sart woman wearing a paranja (Samarkand, between 1905 and 1915) Throughout the Qing dynasty, the sedentary Turkic inhabitants of the oases around the Tarim speaking Qarluq-Chagatay varieties were still largely known as Taranchi, Sart, under Mongol rulers of Khojan or Chagatay lineages. Other parts of the Islamic World still knew this area as Moghulistan or as the eastern part of Turkestan, and the Qing generally lumped all of its Muslim subjects under the category of \\"Hui people\\" without distinguishing between the Mandarin-speaking Dungans and ethnic groups speaking other languages such as the Taranchi, Sarts, Salars, Monguors, Bonans, etc. This is akin to the practice by Russians lumping all Muslims connected to Ottoman or Muslim Chinggisid spheres as Tatars. In 1911, the Nationalist Chinese under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen overthrew Qing Dynasty rule and established the Republic of China. By 1920, Jadidist Pan- Turkism challenged the Qing and Republican Chinese warlords controlling Xinjiang. Turpan poet Abdulxaliq, having spent his early years in Semey and the Jadid intellectual centres in Uzbekistan, returned to Xinjiang with a pen name that he later styled as a surname: Uyghur. He adopted the name Uyghur from the Soviets, who gave that name to his ethnic group in 1921 at Tashkent. He wrote the famous nationalist poem \\"Oyghan\\", which opened with the line \\"Ey pekir Uyghur, oyghan!\\" (Hey poor Uyghur, wake up!). He was later executed by the Chinese warlord Sheng Shicai in Turpan in March 1933 for inciting Uyghur nationalist sentiments through his works.  Modern meanings  Vasily Bartold argues that by the 19th century those described as \\"Sarts\\" had become much more Turkicised than had previously been the case. In the literature of Imperial Russia in the 19th century the term was sometimes used to denote the Turkic-speaking peoples of Ferghana, Tashkent, Chimkent and the Southern Syr Darya Province, (also found in smaller numbers in Samarkand and Bukhara). \\"Sart\\" was also commonly employed by the Russians as a general term for all the settled natives of Turkestan. There was a great deal of debate over what this actually meant, and where the name came from. Barthold writes that \\"To the Kazakh every member of a settled community was a Sart whether his language was Turkic or Iranian\\". Nikolai Ostroumov was firm in his conviction that it was not an ethnic definition but an occupational one, and he backed this up by quoting some (apparently common) local sayings: \\"A bad Kyrgyz becomes a Sart, whilst a bad Sart becomes a Kyrgyz\\". This confusion reached its peak in the 1897 Russian Empire Census: the Ferghana Province was held to have a very large Sart population, the neighbouring Samarkand Province very few but a great many Uzbeks. The distinction between the two was often far from clear. Although historically speaking the Sarts belonged to older settled groups, whereas the Uzbeks were descended from tribes which arrived in the region with Shaibani Khan in the 16th century. It seems that, in Khorezm at least, Uzbeks spoke a now-extinct Kipchak dialect closer to Kazakh, while Sarts spoke a form of Persianised Oghuz Turkic. In Fergana, the Sarts spoke a Karluk dialect that was very close to modern Uyghur and is believed to be the earlier, historical form of modern Uzbek. In 1924 the Soviet regime decreed that henceforth all settled Turkic-speaking peoples in Central Asia (and many others who spoke Persian such as in Samarkand and Bukhara areas) would be known as \\"Uzbeks\\", and that the term \\"Sart\\" was to be abolished as an insulting legacy of colonial rule., despite the fact that Lenin himself used the term in his communiques. For the first few years, however, the language chosen by the Soviet authorities for the new Uzbek SSR was not the modern Uzbek that is found today, but the nomadic, less Persianized and quite exotic dialect of the city of Turkistan in modern Kazakhstan. > \\"The Uighurs are the people whom old Russian travellers called Sart (a name > which they used for sedentary, Turkic-speaking Central Asians in general), > while Western travellers called them Turki, in recognition of their > language. The Chinese used to call them Ch'an-t'ou ('Turbaned Heads') but > this term has been dropped, being considered derogatory, and the Chinese, > using their own pronunciation, now called them Weiwuerh. As a matter of fact > there was for centuries no 'national' name for them; people identified > themselves with the oasis they came from, like Kashgar or Turfan.\\"Lattimore > (1973), p. 237. This dialect proved itself to be largely incomprehensible to most inhabitants of the primary cities, from Tashkent to Bukhara. It was therefore replaced by the modern, fundamentally Persianized \\"urban Uzbek\\" which is consequently the only Turkic language in the world without any vowel harmony. It is thus very difficult to attach a single ethnic or even linguistic meaning to the term \\"Sart\\". Historically the various Turkic and Persian peoples of Central Asia were identified mostly by their lifestyle, rather than by any notional ethnic or even linguistic difference. The Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Turkmens were nomads, herding across steppes, mountains and sand deserts, respectively. The settled Turks and Tajiks, on the other hand, were Sarts, as they either lived in cities such as Khiva, Bukhara or Samarkand, or they lived in rural agricultural communities.  Use by the Dongxiang  The Muslim, Mongol- speaking Dongxiangs of Northwest China call themselves Sarta or Santa. It is not clear if there is any connection between this term and the Sarts of Central Asia.  Use in Siberia  Sart was one of the names applied to the Siberian Bukharans who settled in Siberia in the 17th century.  Footnotes   References  * Owen Lattimore.

Macquarie street is named after Lachlan Macquarie, who oversaw the planning of Hobart’s inner city grid layout. The street forms a One-way couplet with nearby Davey Street connecting traffic from the Southern Outlet in the south with traffic from the Tasman Highway to the east and the Brooker Highway to the north of the city. With annual average daily traffic of 28,500, the road is one of the busier streets in Hobart. From the South Hobart intersection with Cascade Road, Washington Street and Darcy Street, Macquarie Street runs approximately east from the suburb of South Hobart as a two-way street until it reaches the intersection with the southern outlet where it becomes a one-way street for the duration of its length. It is primarily four lanes with the exception of its two-way section which is one lane both ways. The intersections on the one- way portion of the street are regulated by synchronised traffic lights. Macquarie Street borders the city garden Franklin Square. Prominent buildings in the street include the Hotel Grand Chancellor, the Lands Building, which houses the Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment; the Mercury building; St Davids Cathedral; and the Reserve Bank Building. Macquarie Street is featured as a property in the Australian version of Monopoly. Proposed bypass The current one-way couplet system between Macquarie Street and Davey Street was first proposed with the publication of the Hobart's Transportation study in 1965. At the time the couplet system was intended to be a stop gap measure before the then proposed Northside Freeway could be completed. However the proposed freeway was seen as controversial and abandoned. Since the completion of the couplet in 1987, there has been no alternative route between the Southern outlet and the other major arterial roads in Hobart. There has since been several design proposals for a tunnel under the city ranging from cut and cover proposals under Davey/Macquarie Streets to large scale bored tunnels running from the Southern Outlet through to the Tasman Bridge.

YouSendIt.com and YouSendIt Inc. were founded in 2004; the company renamed itself Hightail in 2013. The company's early focus was on helping users send files that were too large for email; it started adding features and plug-ins for businesses in 2007. The service grew quickly, and the firm raised $49 million in funding between 2005 and 2010. The service can now be used via the web, a desktop client, mobile devices, or from within business applications with a Hightail plugin. In May 2015, the company launched Hightail Spaces, designed to encourage creative professionals from conception of an idea to delivery. In 2018, Hightail was acquired by OpenText. History Hightail was founded as YouSendIt Inc. in 2004 by three cofounders: Ranjith Kumaram, Amir Shaikh and Khalid Shaikh. In its early years, Amir pursued advertising revenues, Jimmy Vienneau managed business development, Francis Wu created the graphic design including the logo, while Kumaran focused on the user experience and Khalid did technical work. By May 2004, the company had 300,000 users and was growing 30 percent each month. That September, Cambrian Ventures invested $250,000. At first, YouSendIt was mainly used to send large files, such as photos or audio files, which were too large for the file-size limits set by email providers at the time. $5 million in funding was raised in August 2005. Afterwards there was a falling out between the founders. Within a few years, Khalid and Amir Shaikh left the company, while Kumaran stayed in a product management and marketing role. In 2011, Shaikh plead guilty to making denial of service (DoS) attacks on the website for the YouSendIt service between December 2008 to June 2009. Ivan Koon took over as CEO and YouSendIt continued to raise a total of $49 million. YouSendIt grew as file recipients saw how the service works, reaching 100,000 paying users and 8.5 million registered users by March 2009. In January 2011, YouSendIt Inc. acquired a developer of Microsoft Outlook add- ons, Attassa, and an iPhone app developer, Zosh. In May 2012, a former AOL and Yahoo! executive, Brad Garlinghouse, was appointed as CEO. He refocused the company on file sharing and remote document access, placing it in competition with Dropbox Inc. and Box Inc. Hightail began advertising against competitors Dropbox and Box with slogans like \\"Your files should be neither Dropped nor Boxed\\". In January 2013, YouSendIt acquired Found Software, a company that develops the Found for Mac application that searches for files on Macintosh computers and connected networks. In July of that year YouSendIt announced its rebranding as Hightail, to represent its move beyond file sharing and into file collaboration services. New mobile apps for iOS and Windows devices were also introduced, as well as an unlimited storage option. In September 2013, Hightail acquired adeptCloud, a security-focused file-sharing service for hosting files inside a corporate firewall. In November, Hightail raised $34 million in additional funding. Brad Garlinghouse resigned as CEO in September 2014, allegedly due to disagreements with the board of directors. He was replaced by co-founder Ranjith Kumaran. In February 2018, Hightail was acquired by OpenText. In March 2018, Hightail's employees relocated to OpenText's offices in San Mateo, California and the Campbell office was decommissioned. Products and services Hightail on iPhoneUsers of the Hightail service upload a file to Hightail's servers, and recipients are provided with a link where the file can be downloaded. Users can also manage files in an online folder system, or create desktop folders that access online storage. In addition to Hightail.com, the service can be used from desktop applications for Windows and macOS, or from mobile apps for iOS and Android devices. There are also plugins for business applications, such as Microsoft Outlook and Yahoo! Mail, that allow users to send files from within the application. Documents can be signed digitally with Hightail using a mouse or touch-screen. The service has a pay-per-use security feature and files sent through Hightail are encrypted during transit and while stored on individual devices or servers. The consumer version is sold on a freemium basis, while a business product is sold as YouSendIt for Business, which was originally released as Workstream. YouSendIt for Business integrates with Active Directory and Microsoft Sharepoint. The business version has additional features for corporate use, such as remote data wipes on mobile devices, service level agreements and controls for compliance requirements, such as HIPAA and PCI. As of 2013, the company has more than 40 million registered users, in about 200 countries. Most use its free service for 2 GB of storage, while a half-million pay for unlimited storage and additional features. =Software versions= YouSendIt for Mac desktops in Beta - 2011YouSendIt was initially known as a way for individuals to share personal files and images on YouSendIt.com. In 2007, a Corporate Suite was released that had management and reporting features for business users. The following year, a tool for embedding YouSendIt into third-party websites, called SiteDrop, was introduced. Throughout 2008, YouSendIt added plugins that allowed files to be sent through YouSendIt from within applications like Final Cut Pro, Microsoft Outlook, and Adobe Acrobat. In May of that year, a new release of Yahoo! Mail included YouSendIt built-in, which added a million YouSendIt users over the following two months. In July, YouSendIt's online folder management system and digital signing features were introduced in order to compete with Dropbox. The following month, YouSendIt added applications for Mac and PC desktops, as well as iOS and Android devices. In March 2012, YouSendIt released a separate product intended for business users called Workstream, which was later renamed to YouSendIt for Business. Reception PC Magazine gave the service a 4/5 rating. The reviewer, Jeffrey Wilson, found its app easy to use and noted its digital signing and cloud storage features. Wilson reported problems when trying to use the digital signing feature with the phone held vertically and experienced occasional crashes. TopTenReviews gave the service a 9.5 out of 10. TopTenReviews praised the product for unlimited downloads and accessibility from a desktop, laptop or other mobile device. In benchmark tests, the service took seven minutes to upload a 30 MB file, compared to an industry average of six minutes. According to a review in Small Business Trends, \\"Probably one of the most powerful features is the ability to sign digital documents.\\" A review in About.com said the service was easy-to-use and noted its features for password protection, file-tracking and interface branding, but also pointed out that users cannot copy themselves on files sent through the Hightail Outlook application. A reviewer at MacLife liked its synchronization and collaboration tools, but had some complaints about a \\"clunky\\" user interface. Referring to the \\"for Business\\" product, PC Advisor stated that Dropbox, had better customization, while YouSendIt had the advantage of integration with Sharepoint and Active Directory for corporate environments. Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) conducted a comparative review of vendors in the file sharing and collaboration market in 2012. It gave an average score from an end-user's perspective and a slightly below-average score from an administrator's perspective. ESG noted that the pricing model was expensive on a per-user basis, but its lack of caps or surcharges made it more affordable for heavy users. ESG testers found it easy and secure, but noted it lacked the auditing and workflow features of some competitors.

He was also sheriff of Apache County, Arizona, a member of the Arizona Territorial Legislature, and after statehood a member of the Arizona Senate. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 1914. Biography He was born John Lorenzo Hubbell, but gradually came to be addressed as \\"Don\\", a Spanish term of respect. He was born in Parajito, San Miguel County, New Mexico. He was the son of James Santiago Hubbell and Juliana Gutiérrez. His father had came to the Southwest as a trader on the Santa Fe Trail, settling in New Mexico in 1848. He spent his early years as a Spanish interpreter for the U.S. Army. By 1876 he owned his first trading post at St. Johns, Arizona and he started a second trading post in 1878 that became very successful financially. He helped many Navajos become economically self-sufficient by showing them the patterns of blankets most likely to sell for a profit. He was well respected in the Navajo community for his fair dealings with them. He eventually created an empire of 30 such trading posts on or near the Navajo and Hopi Reservations in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado with warehouses in Gallup, New Mexico and Winslow, Arizona. The trading post at Ganado became the headquarters of Hubbell's numerous and diverse enterprises. He died in Ganado, Arizona. His trading post, now known as the Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site, still stands on the Navajo reservation, and is a National Historic Landmark.

True jasperoids are different from jaspillite, which is a form of metamorphosed chemical sedimentary rock, and from jasper which is a chemical sediment. Sulfidic jasperoids are typical examples of silica-sulfide metasomatism of dolomites, and are found in Nevada, Australia and Iran. They are hard, dense purple-black rocks with considerable content of pyrite. The bodies in Nevada are quite thin (seldom greater than 8 m) and stratabound. Hematitic jasperoids Hematitic silica alteration 'jasperoid', Yarlarweelor mine, Glengarry Basin, W.A.Hematitic jasperoids are examples of advanced silica-hematite alteration, and are known only from the Proterozoic rocks of the Glengarry Basin in Australia. These jasperoids are hard, purple to dark purple rocks composed primarily of amethyst quartz and fine disseminated hematite and some magnetite. While contentious, these jasperoids are thought to form by extreme alteration of wall rocks within a shear zone, and may occur in sediments, andesites, trachytes and basalts. These bodies are often discordant to stratigraphy and are quite podiform in nature. The bodies in the Glengarry Basin are up to 120 m thick and over 3 km in length. These jasperoids are an important source of gold ore within the region. Some hematitic jasperoids may be sourced from metamorphosed and altered jaspillite, and are located above areas identified as submarine basalt vents. These, therefore, may represent a type of exhalite chert or spilite. These are subordinate in volume to the shear-hosted forms and are usually quite thin (less than 3 m). =Conditions of metasomatism= The formation of hematitic jasperoids is considered to be the product of highly oxidised metasomatism of the wall rocks to a shear zone. The presence of carbonate alteration, talc-carbonated high-magnesian basalts and ultramafic rocks and the remnant mineralogy being restricted to hematite, silica, and sulfides indicates oxidising fluid chemistry. Relict volcaniclastic textures in some jasperoids indicate that aluminosilicates have been replaced pervasively by silica + hematite. Transitional forms and poorly developed analogs are present in some gold camps within the Yilgarn craton where deep, reduced methane and carbonate bearing alteration fluids mix with shallower oxidised fluids, resulting in purple-pinkish carbonate flooding alteration within basalts and ultramafic rocks. One example of this is the Widgiemooltha Dome, where carbonated hematite-bearing siliceous basalts containing native gold, arsenopyrite, nickeline and gersdorffite are encountered in the footwall of the Miitel nickel mine. Geographical distribution True jasperoid is found in dolomitic strata in Nevada, USA, and within dolomitic limestone sequences in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. Hematitic jasperoid is only found within the Glengarry basin, Western Australia, although it probably represents an end-member state of a variety of alteration and metasomatism styles found elsewhere.

Sonnenfeld is the founder of Chief Executive Leadership Institute (CELI), a non-profit educational and research institute focused on CEO leadership and corporate governance. Before joining Yale in 1999, he taught for ten years as a professor at the Harvard Business School and nine years as a professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School. Sonnenfeld is widely regarded as a leading international authority on corporate governance, corporate leadership, and a groundbreaking pioneer of CEO learning. Sonnenfeld is known to have advised multiple U.S. Presidents and nominees from both parties, including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Joseph Biden. Sonnenfeld appears regularly on CNBC as a contributor and writes regular pieces for Fortune Magazine, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Chief Executive Magazine.Yale School of Management, Chief Executive Leadership Institute, About - http://celi.som.yale.edu/about  Biography  =Early life= Born in Philadelphia, April 1, 1954, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the son of Burton Sonnenfeld, a men's clothing retailer, and Rochelle Sonnenfeld, a healthcare planner and community leader, who came to the US as a refugee immigrant from Russian pogroms. Sonnenfeld attended public schools in Cheltenham and Abington townships in suburban Montgomery County, Pennsylvania and was an active school leader. While his summers were spent working in the community as an Eagle Scout counselor, he worked through the year in his parents’ retail clothing store in nearby Hatboro, Pennsylvania. He earned his AB, MBA, and doctorate at Harvard University, and during his undergraduate days, he was President of WHRB, the college radio station, as well as an oarsmen. At age 26, he joined the faculty of the Harvard Business School where he taught for 10 years. =Early career - corporate societal impact= As a professor at the Harvard Business School, he was the founding faculty sponsor of the Harvard-Radcliffe Women's Leadership Forum. He published his first two articles in the Harvard Business Review at age 24. In “Why Do Companies Succumb to Price Fixing?” he interviewed leaders as they left prison for illegal collusion, to understand their justification for knowingly committing white collar crimes. In “Dealing with an Aging Work force,” he explored the gaps between the changing labor demography and related corporate retirement policies,Yale School of Management, Faculty Publications, http://qn.som.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/selected- publications/8268 and subsequently served on the board of the National Council on Aging and the President's Advisory Council of the AARP. =Midcareer - CEO leadership= His later books focused on executive careers and succession studies. His work on strategic staffing presented a model of four types of cultures: baseball teams; clubs; academies; and fortresses. His book on CEO succession, The Hero's Farewell: What Happens when CEOs Retire (Oxford University Press, 1988) was the first systematic study of the impact of the exiting incumbent leader upon their organization. In studying the succession of a generation of prominent business leaders, he revealed two frequently misunderstood motives of leaders, in late career: Heroic Mission - a quest for immortal legacy and Heroic Stature - a quest for renown identity. He also developed a typology of departure styles labeled: monarchs; ambassadors; generals; and governors. Based upon this work, Sonnenfeld was asked to head the Blue Ribbon Commission on CEO Succession of the National Association of Corporate Directors.Oxford University Press, http://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-heros- farewell-9780195065831?cc=us⟨=en&tab;=reviews Following the publication of The Hero's Farewell, he left Harvard in 1989 to launch the first school for incumbent CEOs at Emory University, now known as Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. These events produced many firsts such as the first educational forum for media leaders which unified entertainment; journalism, technology, and telecom leaders and the first financial services leadership events to unite insurance, banking, mutual funds, investment banks, and savings and loan leaders with top government regulators. Leaders in converging fields such as Sumner Redstone of Viacom; Michael Dell; Steve Case of AOL; and Ted Turner of Turner Broadcasting met each other at these programs. While at Emory, Sonnenfeld was heavily involved in the Atlanta community, working as an advisor to the leadership of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games; a member of the Governor's Personnel Review Commission; and a commissioner of the local county economic development council. =Move to Yale University= After a decade at Emory University, Sonnenfeld joined the faculty at Yale, bringing with him the CEO College and launching the Chief Executive Leadership Institute, where it still resides.Yale School of Management, Chief Executive Leadership Institute, CEO College, At Yale, he built a new department of Executive Programs, offering 35 programs a year to roughly 2,000 top leaders with sessions in New Haven, New York, Beijing, Delhi, Mumbai, and Shanghai, and opened Yale University's first outpost in Washington, DC in 2011 with support from Lynn Tilton of Patriarch Partners and Leslie Miller Saointz. His 2007 book, Firing Back (with Andrew Ward, Harvard Business School Press), studies the paths to resilience for felled CEOs, as well as victims from natural disasters, warfare, and other forms of disruption and adversity. Firing Back looks at various societal and psychological barriers to recovery and offers guidelines for getting lives back on track with a focus on how tragedy is critical for defining heroic careers. At Yale he teaches courses on leading strategic change and executive careers. At Yale SOM, Sonnenfeld teaches the popular course \\"Strategic Leadership Across Sectors\\", which is consistently the school's most popular and oversubscribed course. Sonnenfeld's previous students from Harvard, Emory, and Yale have gone on to become CEOs, political leaders, and leaders in a wide variety of fields. Sonnenfeld continues to be active in the local community, as a director of Art Space New Haven, a leader in the United Way annual campaign, and a director of the Calvin Hill School. His older brother, Marc Sonnenfeld, is a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in Philadelphia.Marc Sonnenfeld (bio).

It is owned by and licensed to Waipahu, Hawaii. Studios are located in the Kalihi neighborhood of Honolulu, and the transmitter site is near Akupu, Hawaii. KSSK-FM's programming is simulcast with KSSK (AM) in Honolulu, Hawaii. As is the case with many other iHeartMedia adult contemporary stations, KSSK-AM-FM play all Christmas music beginning each year in mid-November, and return to their regular format on December 26.

KSSK-AM- FM used WPLJ's jingle packages until TM Century created a jingle package for KSSK, known as \\"Big Time Honolulu.\\" History KSSK-FM was originally licensed with the call letters KULA on 92.9 MHz, and made its debut broadcast on December 30, 1976.\\"Stations in the U.S.: Hawaii: Waipahu\\", Broadcasting Yearbook (1995 edition), page B-113. At the time it was the sister station to AM 940 KAHU (now KKNE). KULA began as an automated station playing Top 40 music provided by TM Programming. Its daily operations were run by one of its only two employees: Kawika Maszak, who programmed the automation computer to play commercial breaks. In 1979, Heftel Broadcasting purchased KULA, pairing it with 590 KKSK, which Heftel had owned since 1965.\\"Hawaii Radio: Waipahu\\", Broadcasting Yearbook (1986 edition), page B-79. The company was owned by Cecil Heftel, a Hawaii businessman and one-time congressman. Heftel moved the station's studios to Honolulu and ended the automation, hiring a staff of DJs. The format later switched to soft adult contemporary using the slogan \\"Light Rock, Less Talk.\\" In the late 1980s, KULA moved back to Top 40, becoming KXPW \\"Power 92,\\" under long time Top 40 programmer, Jay Stone (now deceased). Power 92 later switched its moniker to \\"92X,\\" with initially Dean Stevens, and later, Brad Barrett as program director. In 1993, New-Tex Communications bought both 590 KSSK and KXPW for $7.5 million, and changed KXPW's call letters to KSSK-FM. At the time, the AM station was the market's #1 rated, and the new owners wanted to capitalize on that success, especially as music listening was shifting to FM. The station moved back to an adult contemporary sound, and began simulcasting part of the day with KSSK, including the top- rated \\"Perry & Price\\" morning show. Eventually the simulcast was expanded to a 24-hour operation. In 2000, Clear Channel Communications acquired KSSK-AM-FM. In 2014, the company was renamed iHeartMedia, Inc.

It was founded by Michael A. Wiener and Gerald Carrus. It became associated with popular radio personalities like Howard Stern, Opie and Anthony, Don Imus and Mike Francesa. Infinity merged with CBS Corporation in 1997 and later became part of Viacom in 2000, when CBS and Viacom merged, serving as the radio division of CBS. After the Viacom split in 2005, Infinity changed its name to CBS Radio. History =Formation and pre-merger= Infinity was founded in 1972 by two former Metromedia executives Michael A. Wiener and Gerald Carrus, with the acquisition of KOME, an FM radio station that served the San Francisco Bay Area, and finally received its license by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) a year later.Barry, David, \\"Jim Hard: He Played a Part in How the West Was Won--By FM Radio,\\" Business Journal-San Jose, April 2, 1990, p. 12. In 1979, Infinity acquired WBCN in Boston. In 1981, Mel Karmazin was brought in as new president. Karmazin oversaw the operation of New York's WNEW-AM (now WBBR) and WNEW-FM for Metromedia. Soon after, the company acquired fellow New York stations WNEW-FM, WKTU (now WNYL; the present-day WKTU is owned by iHeartMedia), WZRC, and WFAN the following years, followed by WYSP-FM in Philadelphia. In 1983, Infinity absorbed KXYZ in Houston and WJMK and WJJD in Chicago. Infinity became a publicly traded company in 1986. Within a year, it had purchased six more stations: KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, WJFK-FM in Washington, D.C., WQYK-AM/FM in Tampa, and KVIL-AM/FM in Dallas. Karmazin and three other company executives took the company private in 1988 and took it public again in 1992.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/infinity-broadcasting- corporation-history/ In 1993, Infinity was expanded to 22 radio stations. =Merger with CBS and Viacom= As a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which loosened ownership restrictions of broadcast stations, Infinity was able to quickly acquire more stations, gradually increasing its portfolio to 75 stations. In 1996, it was announced that Westinghouse Electric Corporation (which owned CBS) would acquire Infinity Broadcasting. Karmazin had attempted to acquire CBS, but Michael Jordan, CEO of Westinghouse, refused to sell the firm to Karmazin but instead agreed to buy Infinity. The $4.9 billion deal was completed on December 31, 1996.Kamen, Robin, \\"To Infinity and Beyond: Mel Takes on CBS,\\" Crain's New York Business, November 24, 1997, p. 1. As a result of the Westinghouse purchase, Infinity was merged into the CBS Radio Group, with Karmazin as president. Karmazin soon became chairman and CEO of CBS Radio, and took the control of the CBS television network. Shortly after, Westinghouse sold its non-broadcasting assets and renamed itself as CBS Corporation. In 1998, CBS decided to spin off a portion of its radio and outdoor advertising holdings as Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, once again bringing the Infinity name back to the public. The stock offering was the largest in the media industry at the time and raised $2.87 billion. The most significant move during 1999, however, was the deal struck with Viacom in September. Sumner Redstone, CEO of Viacom, shot down Karmazin's offer to buy Viacom. Karmazin then offered CBS to Redstone, who eventually made a $37 billion proposal to merge the two companies. Viacom completed the CBS Corp. purchase in May 2000, and it retained 80% ownership of Infinity. At that same year, Infinity acquired Outdoor Systems and renamed it Infinity Outdoor. Under the new ownership by Viacom, Infinity acquired 18 radio stations from its competitor, Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), which needed to divest them as part of its own merger with AMFM Incorporated. The company also purchased Giraudy SA, an outdoor advertising company based in France. In 2002, Viacom acquired the remaining shares of Infinity that it did not already own, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. At that time, Infinity Outdoor was separated from Infinity Broadcasting and renamed Viacom Outdoor. =Departure of Mel Karmazin and Epilogue= Karmazin resigned on May 2004, due to many differences with Redstone.\\"Mel Karmazin, Champion For Howard Stern Resigns\\" by Corey Deitz at About.com Karmazin later said he didn't get along with Redstone and found it difficult to be \\"No. 2\\" at a company, but particularly under Redstone. The two executives continued to snipe at each other through the media even a year after Karmazin left Viacom. \\"Sirius Fun: Mel Karmazin finds new media is a lot like what he used to love,\\" an article by Devin Leonard in Fortune magazine, November 14, 2005 On December 14, 2005, Infinity Broadcasting reverted to CBS Radio, and joined with the CBS and UPN networks (the latter of which would later merge with former rival network The WB to form The CW), Paramount's television properties, Showtime Networks, Viacom Outdoor, Simon & Schuster, and Paramount Parks into a revived CBS Corporation. At that time, CBS Corp. spun off the \\"new\\" Viacom, which includes MTV Networks, BET, and Paramount Pictures, among other assets. CBS Radio was sold to Entercom on November 17, 2017. For a while the Infinity Radio name and logo were used for an online-only variety hits station on CBS Radio's streaming platform, InfinityRadio.com and Radio.com, presumably to prevent trademark dilution.

It takes its name from the de Hoghton family, its historical owners since at least the 12th century. The present house dates from about 1560–65. It was damaged during the Civil War and subsequently became derelict, but was rebuilt and extended between 1862 and 1901. The house is listed at Grade I, as is the Great Barn in its grounds, which is dated 1692. Also in the grounds are two structures listed at Grade II. The house and garden are open to the public at advertised times, and are administered by a charitable trust, the Hoghton Tower Preservation Trust. History Hoghton Tower by Arthur Devis (1712–1787) The property is situated on a hill which may be described as \\"the last, southwesterly tip of the Pendle range\\". The land on which the house stands has been in the possession of the de Hoghton family from at least the 12th century. The present building dates from about 1560–65, and was built for the Right Worshipful Thomas de Hoghton (1518–1580), replacing an earlier house on or near the same site. It has been suggested that the property has links to William Shakespeare through Alexander Hoghton who died in 1581. King James I stayed in the house from 15 to 18 August 1617, while returning from his visit to Scotland. He was accompanied by his favourite George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham and by the Earls of Pembroke, Richmond, Nottingham, and Bridgewater; Lords Zouch, Knollys, Mordaunt, Grey, Stanhope and Compton; the Bishop of Chester Thomas Morton, many baronets and knights, and various Lancashire notables. On 13 August he had hunted at Myerscough Lodge near Garstang where, according to the diary of Nicolas Assheton of Downham, the king spoke about \\"liberty to pipeing and honest recreation\\", in response to a petition from local people.James Craigie & Alexander Law, Minor Prose Works of James VI (STS: Edinburgh, 1982), p. 219: John Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James the First, vol. 2 (London, 1828), p. 397. He was at Preston on 15 August and rode to Hogton where he was met by two actors representing the household gods, one the domestic spirit and the other the guardian of the chase. The next day, a Sunday, there was an attempt to disrupt the church service at Hoghton with distracting noises, for the same cause. James listened to representations from Lancashire gentry and asked Bishop Thomas Morton to draft a response, a forerunner of the Book of Sports.James Craigie & Alexander Law, Minor Prose Works of James VI (STS: Edinburgh, 1982), pp. 219-20. On Sunday afternoon James visited the nearby alum mines at Pleasington. On Monday evening there was a masque danced by the lords and gentlemen on the circle of the lawn at Hoghton. The menu for the feast on the 17 and 18 August, with the names of the cooks and kitchen workers, survives. On 18 August the king left for Lathom House.John Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James the First, vol. 2 (London, 1828), pp. 397-403. Following a petition of the people of Lancashire he lifted the restrictions on Sunday recreations, that culminated in the publishing, initially just for Lancashire, and then nationally the following year, of the Book of Sports. In 1643 the house was damaged by Parliamentary forces during the Civil War. In February 1643, after the taking of Preston by Sir John Seaton, Hoghton Tower was besieged by Parliamentary troops under Captain Nicholas Starkie of Huntroyd. At the time the house held a garrison of only 30-40 musketeers, who capitulated on 14 February. But when the Roundheads entered the house, the powder magazine in the old pele tower, between the two courtyards, exploded with immense force, killing over 100 Parliamentary men. This central tower was never rebuilt. From 1662, for over a hundred years, Hoghton Tower housed nonconformist services in the Banqueting Hall, after Sir Gilbert's son Sir Richard (1616-1678) converted to Presbyterianism and by 1664 it had become a centre, in the Blackburn District, for both Independents and Presbyterians. John and Charles Wesley are reputed to have preached at Hoghton. In 1692–1702 Sir Charles de Hoghton, who founded Preston Grammar School, carried out repairs and rebuilding. King William III was a frequent visitor to the house, being a personal friend of Sir Charles. In 1768 the family permanently moved to another property and it was rented to local farmers; by the middle of the 19th century the house was derelict. Sir Henry de Hoghton, the 9th Baronet, inherited the estate in 1862 and decided to restore the house. It is not known who carried out the earlier part of the restoration, but by 1876 the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin were involved, having carried out work on rooms including the banqueting hall. Sir Henry died in 1876, and restoration work was continued by his brother, Charles, the 10th Baronet, although the house was not ready for him to take up residence until 1880. By that time Paley and Austin had restored the gateway tower and the adjacent walls (1877), designed an entrance lodge (1878), carried out work on the offices in the east wing, built a new kitchen, a new underground service corridor, and made other alterations (1879–80). Further work on the stables and farm buildings was carried out by the Blackburn-based architect James Bertwistle. Sir Charles died in 1893, and from 1896 to 1901 the London architect Robert Dudley Oliver added nursery accommodation, a smoking room, a billiards room and a large drawing room (later used as the ballroom). In 1854 Charles Dickens visited the house and found it in a depressing state of disrepair. The mood of the place inspired his 1868 short story George Silverman's Explanation, in which the house features prominently. Architecture Inner courtyard Hoghton Tower is constructed in sandstone, with stone slate roofs. It has a double courtyard plan, the outer courtyard being entered on the west side through a large gatehouse. The gatehouse is embattled and in two storeys, with a central tower rising by more than one additional storey. Above its archway is a 16th-century cartouche containing a carving of Samson and the Lion. On each side of the gateway, embattled walls lead to square corner pavilions, which are also embattled. Buildings of differing dates stand on the north and south sides of the outer courtyard. This is in two levels, the eastern part being higher than the western. Between the two levels is a wall, and steps leading up to a gateway with 18th-century wrought iron gates between gate piers. In the northeast corner of the courtyard is a 17th-century well house, which stands on the traditional site of the original tower that was destroyed in the Civil War. The inner courtyard has a west gateway, a great hall and kitchen on the north side, state rooms on the east, and living rooms on the south and west sides; it is mainly in two storeys. At the north east corner is a porch (this was formerly the site of a chapel). Bay windows project from the north and south sides of the great hall. Interior The building has many interesting features including the Tudor Well House, which is deep and has a horse-drawn pump and oaken winding gear. The State Bedroom contains the State Bed carved at Samlesbury in about 1560-65. The beautifully proportioned Ballroom has fine, decorative late Victorian doors and panelling by Gillows of Lancaster. The Banqueting Hall has windows with 4,000 panes of Flemish stained glass, original decorative ceiling and a Minstrels' gallery. The house is known to contain three priest holes, including one cut into the side of the well. Gardens and grounds Gateway seen through the entrance to the inner courtyard The house is approached by a long straight drive leading eastwards from the A675 road. It passes through a pair of gate piers about west of the house. Between these gates and the entrance to the outer courtyard is a grassed area known as the Tilting Ground, which is enclosed by a wall on the south side and the Great Barn to the north. On the east side of the house is a walled garden, known as the Wilderness, and on the south side are smaller walled gardens, the Rose Garden and the Rampart Garden. The Great Barn is constructed in sandstone with a slate roof, and incorporates a carthouse. It is dated 1692, and has ball finials on its gables. To the northwest of the house are the coach house and stables, also in sandstone, and dating from the 17th or early 18th century. A small cupola was added to it in the 19th century. At the entry to the drive on the main road is Paley and Austin's lodge of 1878. Present day Hoghton Tower and the Great Barn were designated as a Grade I listed buildings on 22 October 1952. Listed at Grade II are the coach house and stables, and the gate piers on the drive to the west of the house. The gardens are listed at Grade II on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. In 1978 the Hoghton Tower Preservation Trust was established as a charity for the preservation of the house, and to encourage education and research. It raises income by \\"charging an admission fee to visitors, running events, providing holiday accommodation and being rented out as a venue for weddings, filming, corporate entertainment and private functions\\". The house and gardens are open to the general public at advertised times. An admission fee is payable, which includes a guided tour of the house. Inside the house is a collection of dolls' houses. Interior photography is not permitted. Refreshments are available in the tea room, and the stables have been converted into a gift shop. Residential accommodation is available in a converted former garrison. The house has been used as a film location on a number of occasions. For example, parts of the second series of Last Tango in Halifax (2012) were filmed here and the 2005 drama Cassanova starring David Tennant was partly filmed at the house. Since 2015 the house and estate has been run by a team headed by Elena Faraoni, daughter of the current 14th Baronet, Bernard.

He was a Knight of Justice of the Order of St John, which was regarded with disfavour by the Nazis. Early life Dohna-Schlobitten was born in Waldburg (now Nikolajewka, Russia) near Königsberg, East Prussia, the son of a famous Prussian noble family. He began his career as a professional soldier and was already an ensign (Fahnenjunker) by 1901. In the First World War, he served as a General Staff officer, but had to leave the shrunken army in 1919. He subsequently became a member of the Baltische Landwehr but on ethical grounds he chose to leave the military. Later on he opposed Nazism and found himself active in the Confessing Church's Bruderrat (\\"brother council\\") in the old- Prussian Ecclesiastical Province of East Prussia.Biography at German Resistance Memorial Center World War II In 1939, Dohna-Schlobitten was remobilized as a General Staff officer and was appointed as Chief of Staff in Defence District I in Königsberg, later to be promoted to Chief of Staff, Army Group Centre. He acted as a corps leader in France, Norway and Finland. Dohna- Schlobitten's last post was as major general and Chief of the Acting General Command in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), before leaving the Wehrmacht at his own request in 1943. Thereafter, he earned his livelihood from farming in Tolksdorf (now Tołkiny, Poland) in East Prussia. Dohna-Schlobitten maintained contacts with resistance leader Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, and was soon involved in Helmuth James von Moltke's Kreisau Circle through fellow aristocrat Peter Yorck von Wartenburg. Had the attempt on Hitler's life on 20 July 1944 succeeded, Dohna-Schlobitten was foreseen as East Prussia's new provincial administrator. The day after Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg's failed assassination attempt with a briefcase bomb, Dohna-Schlobitten was arrested, and on 14 September 1944, he was sentenced to death in Roland Freisler's infamous Nazi Volksgerichtshof (People's Court). He was executed the same day at Plötzensee prison, along with Nikolaus von Üxküll-Gyllenband, Hermann Josef Wehrle and Michael Graf von Matuschka.Biography of Michael Graf von Matuschka Dohna was married to Maria Agnes née von Borcke, with whom he had a daughter and three sons.

The antennal lobe is a sphere-shaped deutocerebral neuropil in the brain that receives input from the olfactory sensory neurons in the antennae and mouthparts. Functionally, it shares some similarities with the olfactory bulb in vertebrates.  Structure  In insects, the olfactory pathway starts at the antennae (though in some insects like Drosophila there are olfactory sensory neurons in other parts of the body) from where the sensory neurons carry the information about the odorant molecules impinging on the antenna to the antennal lobe. The antennal lobe is composed of densely packed neuropils, termed glomeruli, where the sensory neurons synapse with the two other kinds of neurons, the postsynaptic principle neurons (termed projection neurons) and local interneurons. Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses a single odorant receptor type and targets the same glomeruli as other olfactory sensory neurons expressing that receptor type, such that each glomeruli houses all or the majority of sensory neurons of a given receptor type. The number and identities of glomeruli are species specific; most species contain 40 to 160 individually identifiable glomeruli within the antennal lobe. For instance, there are 32 glomeruli in mosquito, 43 glomeruli in the fruit fly antennal lobe, and 203 glomeruli in cockroach. The local neurons, which are primarily inhibitory, have their neurites restricted to the antennal lobe. Projection neurons, which generally receive information from a single glomerulus, project to higher brain centers such as the mushroom body and the lateral horn. The interaction between the olfactory receptor neurons, local neurons and projection neurons reformats the information input from the sensory neurons into a spatio-temporal code before it is sent to higher brain centers.

Electric utilities Electric utilities have discovered that this basic principle can save utility companies, and their customers, a significant amount of money. Utilities are able to shave the peak of their power demand curves by reducing the voltage across their distribution system. When a utility reaches a point where power demand is expected to exceed supply, utilities only have two options. Either purchase power from another utility, usually at substantial prices, or reduce demand. Often utilities use load management systems to turn off customers' air conditioners, water heaters, and pool pumps to reduce demand. Voltage reduction has become another option for utilities to reduce demand--typically unbeknownst to the customer. However, only the resistive portion of the load responds to the reduction in voltage to reduce aggregate demand. Loads such as incandescent lights and heater coils will use less power as the voltage is lowered. On the other hand, induction motor loads are unaffected by the reduction in voltage, because the current simply rises to account for no change or even a slight increase in power consumption. Current rise is detrimental to motors, since they run hotter. Also, to accomplish the same work the motors have to run longer, for example, if a refrigerator is running at 35% duty cycle at nominal voltage, at lower voltage its duty cycle may increase to 40%. Running hotter and running longer shortens the service longevity of motors. ''' Even some resistive loads provide only short-term benefits. A phenomenon known as load diversity plays a role in voltage reduction and can counteract its effects on occasion. The concept of load diversity can most easily be explained with an example. In your neighborhood, it is unlikely that all of the homes' water heaters are on at the same time. Particularly during non-hot water usage hours (morning and evening showers), when your hot water heater is on, your neighbor's may be off. Due to the distributed and noncoincident nature of these loads, the aggregate peak can remain relatively constant. However, if the voltage is reduced to all of the resistive elements in the water heaters, the elements will not be able to heat the water as quickly. While an immediate reduction in the power demand will be recognized upon initiating voltage reduction, over time water heaters will need to be on longer to achieve the thermostat-set water temperature. Thus, more water heaters will be on at the same time. This will cause the aggregate peak to increase substantially. Therefore, with respect to thermostat-controlled resistive loads, the benefits of voltage reduction can be short lived, and may occasionally end up increasing the aggregate load demand. Conversely increasing the voltage may increase power demand from the resistive loads. Again, the thermostat-controlled resistive loads will react differently, but it is clear that it will cost a customer more to turn on that incandescent reading lamp with higher voltage than it would at a lower voltage. Of course this is assuming that the customer is satisfied with dimmer light, otherwise the customer can replace the light bulbs with ones of higher wattage to provide sufficient lighting. In today's modern world many light fixtures, including the ones with LED type bulbs, are dimmable. Therefore at lower voltage the dimmer will be turned up and at higher voltage it will be turned down, resulting in the same lumens being generated by the light fixture, hence no energy savings will take place. A good comparison of methodology of lowering the voltage to save energy is to draw a parallel with lowering the water pressure to save water. The washing machine will have to fill to the same level, it will just take longer; the toilet tank will fill to the same level, etc. Irrelevant of the pressure the customer will have to use all the necessary water to get the desirable results. There will be short-term savings because the lawn will not get sufficiently watered, but the customer will eventually notice this and will adjust the valves, watering duration or the number of sprinkler heads to compensate for the lower pressure.

It is Yeshiva University’s undergraduate college of liberal arts and sciences for men. (Stern College for Women is Yeshiva College’s counterpart for women.) The architecture reflects a search for a distinctly Jewish style appropriate to American academia.Eitan Kastner, “Yeshiva College and the Pursuit of a Jewish Architecture,” American Jewish History 96 (June 2010), 141–61. Roughly 1,100 students from some two dozen countries, including students registered at Syms School of Business, attend Yeshiva College. On July 27, 2009, it was announced that Barry L. Eichler, Ph.D., will succeed David J. Srolovitz, Ph.D. as dean of Yeshiva College.  Philosophy  Students at Yeshiva College pursue a dual educational program that combines liberal arts and sciences and pre-professional studies with the study of Torah and Jewish heritage, reflecting Yeshiva’s educational philosophy of Torah Umadda, which translates loosely as “Torah and secular knowledge” (the interaction between Judaism and general culture).  History  Like many American colleges and universities, Yeshiva College was founded as a religious seminary. Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) was established in 1896 as the first yeshiva for advanced Talmudic study in America. Its first president, Dr. Bernard Revel, envisioned an institution in which yeshiva students would be able to “harmoniously combine the best of modern culture with the learning and the spirit of Torah.” Through Dr. Revel’s efforts, Yeshiva College was founded in 1928, with 31 students. The creation of the college coincided with the move of RIETS, with its Teachers Institute and Talmudical Academy High School, from the Lower East Side to the newly built Washington Heights campus. Since its inception, Yeshiva College has been training Jewish secular and religious leaders. The growth of its student body over the years necessitated the building of the Rubin and Morgenstern Residence Halls, which supplemented the original and subsequently refurbished Muss Residence Hall. The growth of its academic programs also necessitated the creation of the Mendel Gottesman Library to house its manuscript, rare book and scholarly collections of Judaica, the development of the Pollack Library collections in secular studies, as well as the construction of Furst Hall and Belfer Hall for additional classroom, administrative and laboratory space. Yeshiva College now has an enrollment of more than 1,000 undergraduate men with an additional 300 students learning in major yeshivot in Israel. Students are drawn from the world Jewish community including North America, South America, Europe, Israel and Australia. To this diverse student body, Yeshiva College offers a varied Jewish Studies and liberal arts curricula with intensive support services for their educational, social and religious needs. The Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein Honors Program (1999) is designed for exceptionally gifted students seeking intellectually rigorous experiences, individualized mentoring, exciting research opportunities and leadership development. It also offers summer travel classes to Japan, Italy, Spain. Participation in Honors Program offerings are also open to non-honors students and thus it augments the college’s academic opportunities for all highly motivated Yeshiva College students. During the last six years, through the generosity of Mr. Ronald P. Stanton, the college has experienced a 30 percent growth of its tenure-track faculty in the sciences, humanities and social sciences. In recognition of more than 20 years of sustained support by the Wilf families for their many contributions to Yeshiva, especially in the area of need-based and merit scholarships, the Washington Heights campus was named in their honor (2002). Most recently, the completion of the Glueck Center for Jewish Study (2009) in the heart of the Wilf Campus physically reaffirms the centrality of Torah studies in the college’s academic mission. In his remarks in 1928, Dr. Bernard Revel consecrated Yeshiva College “to the pursuit, interpretation and advancement of universal knowledge in harmony with the great affirmations of Judaism concerning God and man, which are the basis of enlightened civilization … and which still hold a vital message for humanity.”  Academics  Majors offered include: * Biology * Chemistry * Classical languages * Computer sciences * Economics * English * Finance * General Business * Hebrew * History * Jewish studies * Management * Mathematics * Music * Philosophy * Physics * Political science * Pre-engineering * Psychology * Sociology * Speech and drama Combined and joint programs in business administration, dentistry, engineering, Jewish education, Jewish studies, law, occupational therapy, optometry, podiatric medicine, and social work are also available. Minors offered include: * American studies * Architecture * Art * Biology * Business * Chemistry * Classical languages * Computer sciences * Economics * English (Literature and Writing tracks) * Hebrew * History * Jewish studies * Mathematics * Music * Philosophy * Physics * Political science * Psychology * Public health * Sociology * Spanish * Speech and drama The Robert M. Beren Department of Jewish Studies unifies and centralizes all academic Jewish studies offerings at Yeshiva College: Bible, Hebrew, Jewish history, Jewish philosophy, and Judaic studies. In addition to courses leading to the B.A. degree, all students undertake Jewish studies requiring intensive analysis of classic texts in Hebrew and Aramaic. Students are enrolled in a full course of study in one of the following options: * James Striar School of General Jewish Studies/the Mechinah Program * Yeshiva Program/Mazer School of Talmudic Studies * Isaac Breuer College of Hebraic Studies * Irving I. Stone Beit Midrash Program Yeshiva College's Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein Honors program stresses writing, critical analysis, cultural enrichment, and individual mentoring. The S. Daniel Abraham Israel Program allows students who wish to spend a year in Israel to take courses at one of 51 different Israeli institutions.  Student life  Athletics include Maccabees basketball, tennis, fencing, cross-country, golf, soccer, volleyball, wrestling, and baseball. Other student activities include the newspaper The Commentator and the radio station WYUR. David H. Zysman Hall, on the Washington Heights campus of Yeshiva College, is home to one of the main batei midrash (study halls). =Student government= The student government includes the Yeshiva College Student Association (YCSA), the Yeshiva Student Union (YSU), the Student Organization of Yeshiva and Judaic Studies Programs (SOY/JSC), and the Syms School Of Business Student Association. =Dormitories and student housing= Approximately 90% of the undergraduate student population(s) lives on campus.

Biography Danielle Drady is a Māori Australian from the Ngāti Maru iwi (tribe). Drady's mother Prue Drady migrated to Australia in 1961 from the Wātene family Mātai Whetu marae near Thames on the Coromandel Peninsula of New Zealand's North Island. Drady became interested in the sport as a young child when she started tagging along with her mother to her twice-weekly social squash gatherings at a local club. She won the Queensland under-12 championship in 1978, and then went on to claim state and national championships and an under-19 world team crown in her junior years. In 1984, Drady joined the Australian Institute of Sport in Brisbane. Drady turned professional in 1987, and began to steadily climb the world rankings. Her relationship with one of the top men's players, Rodney Martin, also attracted attention in the late-1980s and early-1990s. Having reached the World No. 2 ranking in 1991, the World No. 1 spot appeared to be within Drady's reach. However, her chances were dashed when she snapped her achilles tendon during a practice match. The injury required immediate surgery and kept her out of the game for some time. In a bid to attract attention and sponsorship for Drady's comeback from injury, and to promote the world's first outdoor squash tournament in 1994, Drady's manager Phil Harte (who she later married) wrapped her in glad wrap to play her matches outside Sydney's Martin Place shopping centre in 1994. Drady played and won the World Outdoor Pro-Am wrapped in plastic, and posed for photographs with a 'For Sale' sign strung around her neck. This created a great deal of media coverage and sparked debate about the lengths female athletes should and need to go to in order to attract funding and sponsors. The publicity soon led to Drady becoming the most sponsored player in squash for a period. Drady continued to play top- level squash into the late-1990s. She won the Australian Open in 1996 and the 1998 World Open Pro-AM Sydney. However, her international career began to take a backseat following her marriage to her husband Phil Harte and the birth of her daughter Tayla. Between 2010 and 2015, Drady established the first squash and fitness academy at the Emirates Golf and Country Club in Dubai. As of 2018, Drady lives between Sydney and Dubai. She and her husband Harte run Harte International Events Manager. She also manages an international lifestyle and travel magazine called Classic Lifestyle.

The dam's purpose includes environmental flows, hydro-electric power generation, irrigation, and water supply. The impounded reservoir is called Lake Copeton. Location and features Commenced in March 1968, commissioned in 1973, and completed in 1976, the Copeton Dam is a major dam on the Gwydir River, a tributary of the Barwon River, and is located approximately southwest of Inverell, between Bingara and Bundarra. The dam was built by the New South Wales Water Conservation & Irrigation Commission and the Department of Water Resources to supply water for irrigation. Water from the dam is now released directly into the Gwydir River which is used by irrigators downstream of the dam including for pecan nut farming, and for producing cotton, wheat, lucerne, vegetables, fruit trees, oil seeds and fodder as well as pastures for sheep and cattle. The dam wall comprises of rock fill and is high and is long. The maximum water depth is and at 100% capacity the dam wall holds back of water at AHD. The surface area of Lake Copeton is and the catchment area is . The gate-controlled concrete chute spillway is capable of discharging of water per day. Together with a series of diversionary weirs and regulatory works downstream from the dam, Copeton is able to provide a reliable flow of water to of land. This amount is much less than the originally planned because of higher rates of absorption and evaporation along some of the irrigation channels. Despite these overestimates irrigated agriculture in the Gwydir Valley saw the area become Australia's major cotton-producing region.View of the storage in Copeton Dam in October 2006 =Upgrade of facilities= Aerial photograph of Copeton Dam under construction in 1972 In 2007, it was decided the dam would need an upgrade for safety reasons. The 70 million upgrade is expected to be completed during 2013 and Stage One involves the construction of a four-bay, -wide, fuse plug spillway at Diamond Bay to enable the dam to safely pass extreme floods. Once the fuse plug is installed the dam wall will be raised and the spillway gate modified. Spillway Unexpected erosion of hard, sound, unweathered granite in the unlined spillway discharge channel was caused by rock failure under high in-situ compressive stress. This type of erosion due to high in-situ stress has not been reported elsewhere in the world. Remedial works involved building a training wall to separate the original single spillway into a service spillway and a secondary (emergency) spillway. A concrete slab, anchored to the underlying rock was constructed in the floor of the main scour channel to provide some additional protection on those rare occasions when the secondary spillway will discharge water over this area. The smaller, more frequent flood events will be discharged through the service spillway onto more scour resistant rock which has performed satisfactorily to date. The secondary spillway will operate very infrequently and will only discharge when the capacity of the service spillway is exceeded. Geological investigations for the design of these remedial works included surface stress measurements in the unlined spillway discharge channel as well as geological mapping and diamond core drilling. =Power generation= A hydro-electric power station generates up to of electricity from the flow of the water leaving Copeton Dam with an average annual output of .

The art museum's primary building complex is located in downtown Halifax, and takes up approximately of space. The museum complex is made up of the former Dominion building, and two floors of the adjacent Provincial building. In addition to its main museum complex in Halifax, the museum also operates a satellite branch in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. The museum was established in 1908 as the Nova Scotia Museum of Fine Arts, and was later renamed the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia in 1975. The museum moved into the Dominion building in 1988, and expanded the museum complex in 1998. In 2006, the museum opened a satellite branch in Yarmouth. The museum's permanent collection has over 18,000 works by Nova Scotian, Canadian, and international artists. Its collection is exhibited in its main location in Halifax, as well as its satellite branch in Yarmouth. In addition to exhibiting works from its permanent collection, the museum has also organized, and hosted a number of travelling arts exhibitions.  History  The art museum was founded as the Nova Scotia Museum of Fine Arts in 1908, in order to house the 200 works of the Crown of Nova Scotia. It was renamed the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia in 1975. During the museum's early history, the museum's collection, and its exhibits, moved between several locations, including at one point, in the gunpowder magazine of Citadel Hill. Access point to the museum at the Dominion building. The museum moved into the building in 1988. In 1988, the museum moved to the Dominion Building, opened in 1867 and designed by architects David Stirling and William Hay. The museum expanded its building in 1998 to include two floors of the Provincial Building located just to the south of Dominion Building. The two structures are separated by Ondaatje Court, a public space that besides being used for temporary exhibitions, contains several large permanent sculptures. Underneath the courtyard is a large underground exhibition room which connects the two buildings. During the building expansion, work was done to accommodate the home of Maud Lewis into the museum building. Following that expansion, the museum's complex has of space, although only of it is used as exhibition space. In 1999, plans were announced by the Government of Nova Scotia to built a satellite branch of the museum in southwestern Nova Scotia. On the 28 May 2006, the institution opened a satellite branch of the museum in Yarmouth, a municipality in southwest Nova Scotia. The satellite branch, branded as the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia Western Branch, provides additional exhibition space to exhibit works from the museum's permanent collection. The satellite branch building is housed in a former Royal Bank of Canada building built in 1913, and required renovations to expand its floor space by . In 2008, the museum published a report that recommended the construction of a new museum building, citing its present downtown building as \\"seriously inadequate\\". The museum's administration also noted that the building's lack of climate control, and the region's weather has also made it difficult to preserve works at the location. In March 2018, a feasibility study was completed that recommended that the museum, along with the post-secondary art school, NSCAD University, move to a new \\"cultural hub\\". However, when the museum announced its plans to build a building in April 2019, it did not include joint- facilities with the art school. The proposed building was located at Bishop's Landing, bounded by Lower Water Street, Salter Street, and the Halifax Boardwalk. The cost to build the building is estimated to range between C$130 million to C$140 million, with the majority of it paid by the provincial government. The provincial government has committed C$80 million, while the Government of Canada committed C$30 million. In addition to government funds, the museum has been tasked with raising C$30 million from public and private donors for the construction of the new building. Permanent collection The restored Maud Lewis Home on display at the museum As of March 2019, the museum had over 18,000 works in its permanent collection. More than 2,000 Nova Scotian, Canadian, and other non-Canadian artists have works in the museum's permanent collection. Acquisitions for the museum's permanent collection are reviewed by the museum's Curatorial Committee, which includes curatorial and conservation staff; before being assessed by the museum's direct, Chief Curator, and the Curator of Collections. Further approval is then required from the museum's Acquisition Committee, made up of local artists, community members, and members of the museum's Board of Governors, before it is presented to the Board of Goverors itself for final approval. As of June 2017, the museum had 55 works by Maud Lewis, making the museum's collection the world's largest public collection of works by her. The works are exhibited at the Maud Lewis exhibit, and is the most visited exhibition space in the museum according to the institution. In addition to works by Lewis, the museum's collection also includes her house. Lewis's house was purchased by the Government of Nova Scotia after her death. In 1996, the museum took possession of the home, moving the small building into its Maud Lewis exhibit, along with some restoration work. In June 2013, the museum acquired a collection of 2,070 images by photographer Annie Leibovitz in June 2013. The Leibovitz collection was donated to the museum by the Mintz family, after they acquired it for C$4.7 million. It includes 1,307 editioned prints, and 763 vintage file prints, with the earliest image dating to 1983. However, while the museum maintains ownership of the collection, its copyright is still held by the artist, pending a payment dispute between the donors, certification board, and artist. The museum's collection also features works from a number of First Nations artists, including Kent Monkman. Miss Chief's Wet Dream, a acrylic-on- canvas painting by Monkman, is among the largest works in the museum's permanent collection. =Selected works= File:2ndEarlofHalifaxByJoshuaReynoldsNSArtGallery.jpgJoshua Reynolds, George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, unknown File:EdwardCornwallisArtGalleryofNovaScotia1756.jpgJoshua Reynolds, Edward Cornwallis, 1756 File:Andrew Belcher (1761-1841), 1808 by Robert Field.jpgRobert Field, Andrew Belcher, 1808 File:Edward Mortimer (c.1768-1819).jpgRobert Field, Edward Mortimer, 1815 File:Frederick B.

Although the paper heavily relies on celebrity gossip, it also achieved considerable political influence. History Kurir first issue appeared at the news stands on 6 May 2003. While Kurir's history is relatively short, it is also a checkered one. It goes back to the state of emergency, declared following the assassination of Serbia's Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić, when another daily tabloid named Nacional was shut down. Using its broad powers under the state of emergency act, Serbian government's Ministry of Culture and Information headed by Branislav Lečić issued a temporary ban on publication of Nacional daily on 18 March 2003 for \\"publishing a number of articles relating to the state of emergency and for questioning the reasons behind the state of emergency\\". Then on 1 April 2003, the Belgrade city commercial court started liquidation proceedings against Nacional's publisher in Belgrade, Info Orfej. Despite an appeal, the company's equipment, including 118 computers, was seized on 21 April 2003, two days before the state of emergency ended. Many of the former Nacional staffers found employment in newly formed Kurir, including Dragan J. Vučićević, ex Nacional deputy-editor-in-chief who took the same post at Kurir. New paper bore an uncanny resemblance to the old one, both in tone and layout. This led many critics to conclude that Kurir continued where Nacional left off. In addition to Kurir, another similar daily tabloid Balkan attempted to move into the void left by Nacional's ban. Even the original Nacional sort of reappeared – under the same financial backing, new staff, and a new name Internacional. However, neither publication could keep up commercially. Balkan folded in early 2005 while Internacional changed its name to Srpski nacional along with a format makeover. Many credit Kurir for providing the final nudge to Prime Minister Zoran Živković's shaky government, in effect forcing it to call early elections for 28 December 2003. Throughout fall of 2003, Kurir ran stories of dodgy voting practices in Serbian parliament and blasted the ruling coalition (DOS) MP Neda Arneric for misusing her parliamentary voting rights. They also wrote to no end about Minister of the Interior Dušan Mihajlović's alleged shady deals done through his own Lutra company. Sources that supplied Kurir with all this insider info appear to be members of G17 Plus which led some observers to accuse this party's leadership of deliberate character-assassination by feeding information to a tabloid they knew would publish anything. Kurir, for their part quickly turned on G17 too, as soon as they came into power. Tabloid wrote about their party's president (and since March 2004 deputy PM) Miroljub Labus' conflict of interest in arranging for his daughter to get a scholarship through Ericsson company while later taking part in negotiations between that corporation with state-owned Telekom Srbija. Later, they turned on National Bank of Serbia governor Radovan Jelašić (also from G17 plus). The issue was his plush villa in the elite Belgrade suburb of Dedinje that governor said he bought for 350,000 euros. Kurir on the other hand claimed it could not have cost under million and a half and finally even found a buyer who offered Jelasic a million for the house. This buyer was, it turned out, business tycoon Bogoljub Karic which was strong opponent of G17 plus policies, and during this period Kurir was heavily influenced by Bogoljub Karic.

In 2013, violent crimes fell by 13% from 2012, however there was a slight increase in murders compared to 2007 with 19 recorded murders (with suspects being arrested for 18 of them). Yet, considering the city's population of approximately 2 million, the number of violent crimes are considered low without a notable impact on public life. Although there have been a number of police crackdowns on organised crime gangs, such as the Cămătaru clan and Babubudu gang, organised crime generally has a very much reduced impact on public life. Petty crime Petty crime, however, is more common, particularly in the form of pickpocketing, which occurs mainly on the city's public transport network. Additionally, confidence tricks such as the Maradona scam are sometimes common, especially in regard to tourists. Levels of crime are higher in the southern districts of the city, particularly in Ferentari, a socially-disadvantaged area. Theft was reduced by 13.6% in 2013 compared to 2012.

Plot synopsis Azaro is an abiku, or spirit-child, from the ghetto of an unknown city in Africa. He is constantly harassed by his sibling spirits from another world who want him to leave this mortal life and return to the world of spirits, sending many emissaries to bring him back. Azaro has stubbornly refused to leave this life owing to his love for his mother and father. He is the witness of many happenings in the mortal realm. His father works as a labourer while his mother sells items as a hawker. Madame Koto, the owner of a local bar, asks Azaro to visit her establishment, convinced that he will bring good luck and customers to her bar. Meanwhile, his father prepares to be a boxer after convincing himself and his family that he has a talent to be a pugilist. Two opposing political parties try to bribe or coerce the residents to vote for them. Characters * Azaro is the story's narrator. He is an abiku, or a spirit child who has never lost ties with the spirit world. He is named after Lazarus, of the New testament. The story follows him as he tries to live his life, always aware of the spirits trying to bring him back. * Azaro's father is an idealistic load-carrier who wants the best for his family and the community. He suffers greatly for this, eventually becoming a boxer and later a politician. Azaro's father loves him deeply, but is often bitter at having an abiku and occasionally goes on angry violent tirades. * Azaro's mother works very hard selling anything she can get her hands on for the family. She cares for her family deeply and constantly gives up food and security for her family and their ideals. She is proud that Azaro is her son and goes to great lengths to protect him. * Madame Koto is proprietress of a local bar. She has a liking for Azaro, though at times is convinced he brings bad luck. She starts out as a well-meaning woman, trying to get along with everyone else. However, as the story progresses, she becomes richer, siding with the political Party of the Rich, and is often accused of witchcraft. She tries to help Azaro and his family on numerous occasions but seems to try to take Azaro's blood to remain youthful. * Jeremiah, the Photographer is a young artist who brings the village to the rest of the world and the rest of the world to the village. He manages to get some of his photographs published, but practices his craft at great personal risk. * The Landlord supports the Party of the Rich and is angry with Azaro's family for causing troubles to him and his compound.

Today, he is considered to be one of the greatest Chan painters in history. His ink paintings, such as the Daitokuji triptych and Six Persimmons are regarded as essential Chan paintings. Muqi's style of painting has also profoundly impacted painters from later periods to follow, especially monk painters in Japan. According to Chinese secondary sources, Muqi's surname was thought to be Li. \\"Muqi\\" was his art name, and \\"Fachang\\" was, in fact, his formal name in the monastery system.  Biography  Muqi was born in the early 13th century, approximately around 1200–1210, toward the end of Southern Song Dynasty in China. According to Dr. Aaron Rio, specific life details of Muqi are commonly unknown. However, the scholar stated that Muqi was initially from Sichuan, China. This fact is known from his signature, \\"The monk from Shu [Sichuan], Fachang, respectfully made this,\\" () on one of his most renowned paintings, Guanyin, Crane, and Gibbons. Meanwhile, Muqi was identified as the disciple of the esteemed Chan master, Wuzhun Shifan (1177–1249), who was also from Sichuan. The apprenticeship was established at a temple in Mount Qingcheng in Sichuan. After starting his early life as a monk in the monastery in Sichuan, Muqi later moved to the capital city of Southern Song Dynasty, Hangzhou. He was actively involved in monastery events, including the reformation of the Liu Tong (六桐) Monastery near the West Lake area. Although Muqi was often associated with Liutong Temple, no primary sources have been found to support the specific monastery Muqi once lived. Nevertheless, Muqi's memorial portrait was placed on Changxiang Lane where the Liutong Temple was located and prospered. According to the tradition of storing the monk's memorial portrait at the temple of his closest association, Liutong Temple, therefore, became closely related to Muqi. There is no known exact date of death but Muqi's was thought to have passed away during some time during the Zhiyuan era from 1264 to 1294. Paintings attributed to Muqi Significant works attributed to Muqi are listed as follows—presently in the Daitokuji in Kyoto are a triptych of Guanyin, Crane, and Gibbons; Tiger; Dragon; and the much-reproduced Six Persimmons. Other works sometimes attributed to Muqi or as being \\"in the style of Muqi\\" include various nature studies, for example, the four scenes from the landscape painting Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang, and a Luohan painting in the Seikado Museum. =The Triptych: Guanyin, Crane, and Gibbons= Muqi, Guanyin, Crane, and Gibbons, S. Song (Chinese), 13th century, set of three hanging scrolls, ink and color on silk, H: 173.9-174.2 cm., Collected in Daitokuji, Kyoto, Japan. Designated National Treasure Muqi's triptych of Guanyin, Crane, and Gibbons at Daitokuji in Kyoto, Japan, is considered as one of Muqi's iconic works. The white-robed Guanyin was depicted from a three-quarter perspective as the centerpiece of the triptych. Sitting against a cliff with hands and legs covered by loosely folded draperies of the robe, Guanyin is wearing lavishly decorated head-wear and jewelry to show his status as a Bodhisattva. The willow tree twig is placed on his left side. The image of Muqi's \\"white-robed Guanyin\\" has also conveyed a unique situation when Guanyin was sitting by the water under the moon. Muqi's signature \\"respectfully made by the monk Fachang of Shu [Sichuan]\\" was signed on the lower left corner of the painting along with the seal of \\"Muqi\\". The crane is portrayed in the left painting of the triptych with its body leaning forward to the right. It is galloping loudly with its head lifted, neck stretched, and beaks widely open. On the other side of the Guanyin painting rests the Gibbons painting. A mother gibbon is sitting on a withered tree branch, holding a baby gibbon in her right arm while grasping the tree branch with her left. No specific arrival dates of the three paintings has been recorded when they were shipped from China to Japan. The three artworks were first mentioned as a triptych in the Inryoken Nichiroku (), the daily record of events and activities taking place in the Inryoken pavilion, in 1466. Later in the 16th century, the paintings were donated by Taigen Soshin to Daitokuji. They were considered to have been initially painted as a set by Muqi evident by the poem cited by Wuzhun on the Guanyin painting. Nevertheless, other than the fourth verse, only Guanyin and the gibbons were mentioned in the poem. Hence, according to scholars, Wuzhun's poem seems to have weakened the theory of the three paintings being created as a triptych. Moreover, as Nancy Wei mentioned, since the Guanyin painting is more severely damaged than the other two, the three works may actually be produced during different time periods. However, the art historian, Fukui, has pointed out the correspondence of the environmental settings in the three paintings, which may become evidence to support the paintings been created as a triptych from the very beginning. =Six Persimmons= Muqi, Six Persimmons, 13th century, Southern Song (Chinese), Collected in Daitokuji, Kyoto, Japan The Six Persimmons is perceived as another major work of Muqi's. Information on the painting is rarely found before it was given to the Ryoko-in, a sub- temple of Daitokuji, as a gift for the temple's establishment in 1606 during the Momoyama period. Since tea ceremonies were often held in Ryoko-in, the painting has been entirely associated with tea events consequently. Meanings behind the painting are related with the number \\"six\\" associated with tastes, thoughts, wisdom, ways, and patriarchs of the Chan school. As the art historian, Laurence Sickman stated, the painting has given great emphasis to the meaning behind the persimmons aligning with the fundamental nature of Buddhism. It has captured the instantaneous vision of the world from the painter. In the 20th century, prints of Six Persimmons were frequently produced as book covers and wall posters. In the meantime, Six Persimmons, together with other Zen Buddhism paintings, has brought the wave of Zen fascination to the West. Perceived as a masterpiece of Chan art embodying the essence of Chan philosophy, Six Persimmons has been analyzed by multiple scholars from the West. Arthur Waley, the English orientalist and sinologist who contributed to the translation of Chinese and Japanese poetry into English, has described the painting as the \\"passion... congealed into a stupendous calm.\\" Muqi's reception in China and Japan Nowadays, Muqi is honored as the predecessor of Chan painting. His works are considered among the most expressive of the Chan paintings, not to mention his reputable Six Persimmons been regarded as \\"the most quintessentially Chan painting.\\" From today's perspective, Muqi has obtained prominent status among monochrome ink painters who transmitted the tradition of Song Literati paintings to Yuan painting styles. Nevertheless, by the time, Muqi was ignored by the mainstream during the Chinese Song dynasty, and received mainly negative comments in the following Yuan dynasty. Muqi's paintings eminently conveyed the Song \\"naturalism,\\" which contradicted the trend back to classicism led by Zhao Mengfu later in the Yuan period (1271–1368). Muqi's style was criticized as \\"sketchy, unsophisticated, and coarse\\" and \\"inappropriate to be displayed in monasteries\\" by Yuan critics like Xia Wenyuan. In contrast to his reception in 13th and 14th century China, Muqi received a more appreciative audience in Japan. His works were extensively collected and brought from China to Japan. The paintings were found to be listed in several inventories of Japanese Zen temples, such as Myoshinji and Engakuji, as well as in the Ashikaga shogunate collection. Perceived as the prominent Chinese painter and culture transmitter, Muqi was worshiped and followed by a large crowd of Japanese painters since the 14th century—for example, the Zen painter Mokuan Reien. No single Chinese artist was perceived as more influential in the history of Japanese painting than Muqi as the best known and the most celebrated Chan painter in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and the Nanbokucho period (1336–1392). Known as \\"Mokkei\\" or \\"the Reverend\\" in Japan, Muqi and his style have deeply affected a whole generation of Japanese painters in the use of brushstrokes and motifs. The ink bird-and-flower screen was one important concept during the Muromachi period (1336–1573) in the 14th century, which was popularized by Muqi with his triptych painting Guanyin, Crane, and Gibbons and his boneless style. The term \\"Muqi mode\\" was created in describing this boneless method of painting without a thin ink outline. \\"Muqi mode\\" was massively used by 14th-century Japanese painters and was tied to the essence of Zen artworks with the idea of naturalism and spontaneous enlightenment.

It is a dimensionless quantity and always less than unity. In atomic systems, by convention, the APF is determined by assuming that atoms are rigid spheres. The radius of the spheres is taken to be the maximum value such that the atoms do not overlap. For one-component crystals (those that contain only one type of particle), the packing fraction is represented mathematically by :\\\\mathrm{APF} = \\\\frac{N_\\\\mathrm{particle} V_\\\\mathrm{particle}}{V_\\\\text{unit cell}} where Nparticle is the number of particles in the unit cell, Vparticle is the volume of each particle, and Vunit cell is the volume occupied by the unit cell. It can be proven mathematically that for one-component structures, the most dense arrangement of atoms has an APF of about 0.74 (see Kepler conjecture), obtained by the close-packed structures. For multiple-component structures (such as with interstitial alloys), the APF can exceed 0.74. The atomic packing factor of a unit cell is relevant to the study of materials science, where it explains many properties of materials. For example, metals with a high atomic packing factor will have a higher \\"workability\\" (malleability or ductility), similar to how a road is smoother when the stones are closer together, allowing metal atoms to slide past one another more easily. Single component crystal structures Common sphere packings taken on by atomic systems are listed below with their corresponding packing fraction. * Hexagonal close-packed (HCP): 0.74 * Face-centered cubic (FCC): 0.74 (also called cubic close-packed, CCP) * Body-centered cubic (BCC): 0.68 * Simple cubic: 0.52 * Diamond cubic: 0.34 The majority of metals take on either the HCP, FCC, or BCC structure. Simple cubic unit cell =Simple cubic= For a simple cubic packing, the number of atoms per unit cell is one. The side of the unit cell is of length 2r, where r is the radius of the atom. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm{APF} &= \\\\frac{N_\\\\mathrm{atoms}V_\\\\mathrm{atom}}{V_\\\\text{unit cell}} = \\\\frac{1\\\\cdot\\\\frac43\\\\pi r^3}{\\\\left(2r\\\\right)^3} \\\\[10pt] &= \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6} \\\\approx 0.5236 \\\\end{align} = Face-centered cubic = FCC structure For a face-centered cubic unit cell, the number of atoms is four. A line can be drawn from the top corner of a cube diagonally to the bottom corner on the same side of the cube, which is equal to 4r. Using geometry, and the side length, a can be related to r as: : a = {2r}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\, . Knowing this and the formula for the volume of a sphere, it becomes possible to calculate the APF as follows: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm{APF} &= \\\\frac{N_\\\\mathrm{atoms}V_\\\\mathrm{atom}}{V_\\\\text{unit cell}} = \\\\frac{4\\\\cdot\\\\frac43\\\\pi r^3}{\\\\left({2\\\\sqrt2r}\\\\right)^3} \\\\[10pt] &= \\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{2}}{6} \\\\approx 0.740\\\\,48048\\\\ . \\\\end{align} =Body-centered cubic= BCC structure The primitive unit cell for the body-centered cubic crystal structure contains several fractions taken from nine atoms (if the particles in the crystal are atoms): one on each corner of the cube and one atom in the center. Because the volume of each of the eight corner atoms is shared between eight adjacent cells, each BCC cell contains the equivalent volume of two atoms (one central and one on the corner). Each corner atom touches the center atom. A line that is drawn from one corner of the cube through the center and to the other corner passes through 4r, where r is the radius of an atom. By geometry, the length of the diagonal is a. Therefore, the length of each side of the BCC structure can be related to the radius of the atom by :a = \\\\frac{4r}{\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\, . Knowing this and the formula for the volume of a sphere, it becomes possible to calculate the APF as follows: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm{APF} &= \\\\frac{N_\\\\mathrm{atoms}V_\\\\mathrm{atom}}{V_\\\\text{unit cell}} = \\\\frac{2\\\\cdot\\\\frac43\\\\pi r^3}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{4r}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\right)^3} \\\\[10pt] &= \\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\\\approx 0.680\\\\,174\\\\,762\\\\, . \\\\end{align} = Hexagonal close-packed = HCP structure For the hexagonal close-packed structure the derivation is similar. Here the unit cell (equivalent to 3 primitive unit cells) is a hexagonal prism containing six atoms (if the particles in the crystal are atoms). Indeed, three are the atoms in the middle layer (inside the prism); in addition, for the top and bottom layers (on the bases of the prism), the central atom is shared with the adjacent cell, and each of the six atoms at the vertices is shared with other five adjacent cells. So the total number of atoms in the cell is 3 + (1/2)×2 + (1/6)×6×2 = 6. Each atom touches other twelve atoms. Now let a\\\\ be the side length of the base of the prism and c\\\\ be its height. The latter is twice the distance between adjacent layers, i. e., twice the height of the regular tetrahedron whose vertices are occupied by (say) the central atom of the lower layer, two adjacent non-central atoms of the same layer, and one atom of the middle layer \\"resting\\" on the previous three.

As indicated by its Japanese designation, \\"training aircraft for on-board work\\" (機上作業練習機, kijō sagyō renshū-ki?), it was designed to train crews in operating equipment for bombing, navigation, and communication, as well as navigation techniques. A total of 798 K11Ws were manufactured, including a small number of K11W2 ASW and transport aircraft alongside the K11W1 trainer variant. These aircraft were also used in kamikaze mission during the last stages of the Pacific War. Design and development A Kyushu K11W Shiragiku, note the non- retractable landing gear. The Kyūshū K11W had a rather simple mid-wing layout. The crew consisted of a pilot and gunner/radio operator sitting in line under the canopy and the trainee bombardier, trainee navigator, and instructor in the lower fuselage beneath the wing. The K11W served as the basis for the Q3W1 Nankai (南海, \\"South Sea\\") anti-submarine patrol aircraft, which did not progress beyond the development phase.

It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on February 25, 1999. Plot In the teaser, Chandler and Monica cuddle while cooperating on a crossword puzzle, which Joey finds cute. That night, however, he dreams that he was doing the crossword puzzle with Monica, leading him to wonder if he finds her attractive. This is exacerbated when, at Central Perk the next morning, Monica is found wearing his sweatshirt as opposed to Chandler's, and later when Monica asks him to taste her cooking, leading to him confessing about his dreams. A bit of honest discussion between the three of them reveals that Joey is not really attracted to Monica, but rather to the intimacy and friendship she shares with Chandler. The two explain that this is because they were friends first before they started dating. Equipped with this new philosophy, he first tries to get on Rachel's good side, on the grounds that they are already friends, but she advises him to strike up a friendship with a woman and then pursue a relationship. Joey tries to do this, but when meeting a woman to strike up a friendship, he ends up in a threesome with her and her roommate. While digging beneath a Central Perk chair cushion for spare change, Phoebe uncovers a policeman's badge. Though she promises to return it, she finds using it far more entertaining, exploiting her new-found power to force a smoking bystander to apologize to a tree on which she snubbed out a cigarette. When she begins threatening her friends with arrest, she realizes she has gone too far, but before she can return it, she tries to force an illegally-parked man to move his car. He turns out to be a policeman as well, and is unimpressed when she claims to be an undercover cop from the 15th district of Manhattan. This fellow, Gary, turns out to be the owner of the badge, but when he arrives at Monica's apartment to arrest her, he asks her out on a date instead. Rachel is helping Ross shop for a new couch. After he finds one he likes, he forgoes delivery charges by having her help him carry it the three blocks to his apartment (he also fends off a condescending salesman by proclaiming that he and Rachel have had sex 298 times, leaving Rachel incredulous as to how he kept count). Getting it up a narrow stairwell proves more problematic, and after Rachel gets help in the form of Chandler, the three attempt to manhandle the couch up the stairs, only to get it stuck between landings. The couch ends up cut in half after Rachel accidentally pulls the fire alarm and Ross’ neighbors have to walk over the couch. Ross then attempts to return it and receives store credit in the amount of four dollars. Pivot scene A scene in the episode where Ross, while moving his new sofa up the stairs, screams \\"pivot\\" at Rachel and Chandler was called iconic by the magazine House Beautiful. The Irish website Joe wrote that the mathematician Caroline Zunckel explained how the friends got the sofa upstairs, saying: \\"By applying Pythagoras' theorem to the estimated measurements of Ross's sofa in a vertical position and dimensions of the stairs, I was able to establish that it would have been possible to get the item upstairs. It's quite simple really!\\". HuffPost wrote that it was one of the \\"14 Best Episodes of Friends to Binge Watch Right Now\\".

Aksumite currency was coinage produced and used within the Kingdom of Aksum (or Axum) centered in present-day Eritrea and Ethiopia. Its mintages were issued and circulated from the reign of King Endubis around AD 270 until it began its decline in the first half of the 7th century. During the succeeding medieval period, Mogadishu currency, minted by the Sultanate of Mogadishu, was the most widely circulated currency in the Horn of Africa. Aksum's currency served as a vessel of propaganda demonstrating the kingdom's wealth and promoting the national religion (first polytheistic and later Oriental Christianity). It also facilitated the Red Sea trade on which it thrived.Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum: An African Civilization of Late Antiquity. Edinburgh: University Press, 1991, p. 155. The coinage has also proved invaluable in providing a reliable chronology of Aksumite kings due to the lack of extensive archaeological work in the area.Hahn, Wolfgang, \\"Coinage\\" in Uhlig, Siegbert, ed., Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003. pp. 767–768. Origins =Pre-coinage period= Though the issuing of minted coins didn't begin until around 270, metal coins may have been used in Aksum centuries prior to centralized minting. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions that the Aksumite state imported brass (), \\"which they use[d] for ornaments and for cutting as money\\", and they imported \\"a little money (denarion) for [use by] foreigners who live there.\\" It can be inferred, therefore, that early Aksumite kings, located on the international trading waters of the Red Sea, recognized the utility of a standardized currency for facilitating both domestic and international trade.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 151. =Influences= Though Aksumite coins are indigenous in design and creation, some outside influences encouraging the use of coins is undeniable. By the time coins were first minted in Aksum, there was widespread trade with Romans on the Red Sea; Kushana or Persian influence also cannot be ruled out. Roman, Himyarite, and Kushana coins have all been found in major Aksumite cities, however, only very small quantities have been attested and the circulation of foreign currency seems to have been limited.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 152 Though South Arabian kingdoms had also minted coins, they had already gone out of use by the time of certain Aksumite involvement in South Arabia under GDRT, and only very rarely produced electrum or gold denominations (silver mainly in Saba' and Himyar, while bronze in Hadhramaut), making influence unlikely. The major impetus, however, was not emulation but economical; the Red Sea and its coasts had always been an international trade area and coins would greatly facilitate trade and wealth in the now \\"world power.\\"Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 150. Despite these influences, the coins were of genuinely indigenous design, and foreign influences were relatively weak and few in number. Pre-Christian period Aksumite currency were first minted in the later stages of the growth of the empire, when its Golden Age had already begun. The minting of coins began around 270, beginning with the reign of Endubis. Source of materials =Gold= Gold coin of Endubis. Gold seems to have been acquired from a number of sources. Gold probably came from Sasu (southern Sudan), as well as more nearby Ethiopian sources, though the latter isn't well documented for the north. A gold trade from the southern areas of Ethiopia such as the medieval province/kingdom of Innarya has been attested from the 6th century (i.e. from the writings of Cosmas Indicopleustes) and continued through James Bruce's day (18th century). Gold also came from more northerly sources such as Gojjam, Beja lands, and what is now Eritrea, though the latter two are less certain.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 143 However, a recent gold exploration assay in Eritrea has found significant gold deposits at Emba Derho, and deposits are also attested at Zara in central-western Eritrea.\\"Promising results from Eritrean gold campaign\\", Mining Weekly Online. June 6, 2006. =Silver and others= Base coinage with the rare front portrait. While local sources of gold are attested during the Aksumite era, silver seems to have been rarer in Aksum. No mention of silver mines in the region exist until the 15th and 16th centuries. Though silver was imported as attested by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea,Munro- Hay, Aksum, p. 145 given the preponderance of silver coins, it could not have been the only source of silver in Aksum. Furthermore, a significant number of the silver coins contain gold inlays (presumably to increase the value), which would have been unnecessary if silver were so rare that it had to be mainly imported. Silver may have been obtained from the refinement of gold, which sometimes occurs naturally with silver in an alloy called electrum. Copper and bronze do not seem to have existed locally in the Aksumite empire, though they were noted as imports in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Value Though the gold coins were certainly the most valuable issue, followed by the silver one, the exact relationship between the three issues (gold, silver, and bronze) is not known. The supply of gold was closely controlled by the Aksumite state, as noted by Cosmas Indicopleustes, and other precious metals were undoubtedly also closely controlled, allowing the Aksumite state to ensure the usage of its currency.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 154. The quality of the Aksumite coins were also closely controlled, usually of high purity. For example, the lowest purity of gold recorded thus far for Aphilas is 90 percent.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 159. Early issues were often very close to their theoretical weights, and some were even over.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 158.) However, the weight of the coins tended to decrease over time (though not continuously or uniformly). This may have reflected a desire to conform to the Diocletian monetary reform of 301, when the aureus was decreased from 1/60 of a pound to 1/72. Despite decreases in weight, the purity of the gold was largely maintained, even by later kings. The relative abundance of Aksumite coins as well as the many that have yet to be foundObelisk, new finds unleash debate in Ethiopia. The Seattle Times Online. 28 December 2005 indicate that Aksum must have had access to large quantities of gold. Design Wazeba using the Ge'ez script and language. The coins were often inscribed in Greek, as much of its trade was with the \\"Graecised Orient.\\" Later inscriptions made more use of Ge'ez, the language of the Aksumites, perhaps indicating a decline in its use for more international trade (i.e. with Rome and India). The obverse of the coins would always feature an image of the king (almost always in profile) wearing either a crown or helmet/regnal headcloth. The headcloth had some image perhaps representing pleats, rays, or sunburst in the front, as well as the tied end of a cloth or fillet to hold the helmet or headcloth in place. Most coins also included an inscription (usually in Greek) meaning \\"King of Aksum\\" or King of the Aksumites\\" (Basileus AXWMITW). However, many coins were also minted anonymously (or even posthumously), especially during the 5th century. Inscriptions on the coins could include a bisi name (\\"man of,\\" Ge'ez: bə'əsyä ብእስየMunro-Hay, Aksum, p. 39.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 75) or an epithet (beginning with Əllä, Ge'ez: እለ \\"he who\\") in addition to the king's personal name. Bisi names were used more often in conjuncture with personal names on earlier coins, while the epithets were more common in later years, being the only inscribed name in a few sources. Greek text was used in conjunction with Ge'ez script inscriptions, but was the only language used on the gold coins, with the exception of the Ge'ez language coins of Wazeba and MHDYS. Over time, the Greek used on the coins (gold, silver and bronze) deteriorated, indicative of Aksum's decline. Moreover, beginning with MHDYS for bronze coins and Wazeba for silver coins, Ge'ez gradually replaced Greek on the legends. =Mottoes= Aksumite coins used a number of mottoes throughout the period in which they were minted, beginning in the early 4th century. Around this time, numerous anonymous bronze coins with simply Βασιλεύς (Basileus, \\"King\\") on the obverse were minted by either King Ezana or one of his successors. The coins bore the first example of an Aksumite motto on the reverse, \\"May this please the people\\" (Greek: ΤΟΥΤΟΑΡΕΣΗΤΗΧΩΡΑ). It was later written in unvocalized Ge'ez as \\"ለሐዘበ ፡ ዘየደአ\\" LʾḤZB ZYDʾ and under King Kaleb also \\"ለሀገረ ፡ ዘየደአ\\" LHGR ZYDʾ, \\"may this please the city [country].\\" Similar mottoes were used by other kings. Coins of the early 7th-century Emperor Armah had inscribed on the back \\"ፈሰሐ ፡ ለየከነ ፡ ለአዘሐበ\\" FŚḤ LYKN LʾḤZB (vocalization: ፍሥሓ ፡ ለይኲን ፡ ለአሕዛብ ፡ fiśśiḥā la-yikʷin la-'aḥzāb, \\"Let the people be glad,\\" lit. \\"Gladness let there be to the peoples\\").Sergew Hable Selassie, Ancient and Medieval Ethiopian History to 1270. United Printers: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1972, p. 190. Kings Coins were struck in the name of eighteen Aksumite kings from c. 295 until c. 620: Endybis, Aphilas, Ousanas I, WZB, Ezana, Ouazebas, Eon, MHDYS, Ebana, Nezana, Ousanas II, Kaleb, Armah, Ella Gabaz, Israel, Gersem, Joel, and Hethasas.Alessandro Bausi, Review of Wolfgang Hahn and Vincent West,Sylloge of Aksumite Coins in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, in Aethiopica 20 (2017), 287–288. =Endybis= Coins of king Endybis, 227-235CE. British Museum. The left one reads in Greek \\"BACIΛEYC AΧWMITW\\", \\"Emperor of Axum\\". The right one reads in Greek: ΕΝΔΥΒΙϹ ΒΑCΙΛΕΥϹ, \\"King Endybis\\". Endubis, the first known Aksumite king to mint coins, focused almost entirely on his image on both the obverse and reverse. The images were of his head and upper half of his chest in profile, wearing a regnal headcloth or helmet and abundant jewelry. In addition to inscribing his regnal name, Endybis also noted his \\"bisi name, a practice continued by his early successors, but often missing in later coins. The bisi name was a sort of tribal affiliation or \\"ethnikon\\" (i.e. a reference to the king's lineage) that was different for every king. Endybis also emphasized his religion through the pre-Christian symbol of the disk and crescent as a propaganda method (a purpose which the coins already served). A second motif used by Enybis and continued by following coins was that of two (though sometimes one in later years) ears of barley or wheat around the image of his head in profile. Though no inscriptional evidence exists, given its prominent position around the image of the king, the two ears of barley (or wheat) may have been representative symbols of the Aksumite state. Though later coins would be smaller, Endybis chose the Roman aureus to standardize Aksumite coin weights against, with gold issues at half-aureus around 2.70 grams (more precisely, the theoretical weight may have been 2.725g). =Aphilas= Silver coin of Aphilas with gold inlay. Whereas all of Endubis's coins feature the king with a headcloth or helmet, Aphilas's coins show the king wearing an impressive high crown on top of the headcloth. The crown featured colonnades of arches supporting high spikes, on top of which rested large discs of unidentified composition. In addition to the crown and headcloth, Aphilas's coins included further images of regalia, such as a spear, a branch with berries, the depiction of the arms, the addition of tassels with fringes to the imperial robe, and more jewelry, such as amulets and bracelets. Despite this innovation, Aphilas continued to use the image of himself in the regnal headcloth in some coins, sometimes as the reverse, while his crowned image is only found on the obverse.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 156. One of his issues included his frontal image on the obverse, which ended with his reign and was only revived by the late kings. Two other minting features of Aphilas were also abandoned by later rulers. One of these was the use of just the inscription \\"King Aphilas\\" as the reverse of a coin, the only purely epigraphical side ever used on an Aksumite coin. The other was his use of a single ear of barley or wheat as a reverse, though his use of two ears circling around the king's image continued. Aphilas introduced a number of different standards for all three metals, some of which lasted through to the 7th century, while the use of others ended with his reign. His new gold coins (issued in conjunction with the older) of a quarter aureus and eighth aureus were soon abandoned (each are known from only one specimen), and 1/16 aureus coins have been found, though these are more likely to be deliberate debasements to increase profit (Aksumite gold was generally very pure, however).Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 157. Aphilas's silver coin, however, issued at half the weight of the former, became the new Aksumite standard for silver up until the end of coinage. The older coin was presumably more valuable than needed, and the new coin remedied the problem. Aphilas's bronze issue, however, was instead doubled to 4.83 grams. The coin's rarity may attest to its quick withdrawal from the market, as is assumed with his quarter-aureus. These two issues are the only one of Aphilas's issues to portray him frontally, rather than in profile. =Ezana= Ezana. During Ezana's reign a major change in both the Aksumite kingdom and its coinage took place as a result of the change of the official religion to Christianity, one of the first states ever to do so. While Ezana's coins in the first half of his reign are almost identical to those of Aphilas, barring minimal weight reductions, those of his second half employ revolutionary designs. With his conversion to Christianity, Ezana began to feature the Cross on his coins, the first time the Christian cross had ever been featured in coinage in the world. Some of his gold Christian coins are of the weight before Constantine I's weight reform in 324, indicating a conversion before this date or perhaps a few years after, as the Aksumite coinage may not have changed weights immediately.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 160. Along with the adoption of the Cross on his coins came, of course, the abandonment of the star and crescent symbol on the coins. Later Christian coins reflect the adoptment of the 4.54 g standard by Constantine, with theoretical weights in Aksumite coins likewise dropping to 1.70 g for the gold coins.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 161. Coins of Ezana without any symbol at all have also been found, along with similar symboless coins of his father, Ousanas. These may reflect a transition in the religion in Aksum when Frumentius was influencing Ezana's father and gathering Christians in the country, giving weight to the writings of Rufinus. The lack of symbol altogether may reflect an uncertainty as how best to exhibit the change in religion of the Aksumite state.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 162. Weight standards =Gold coins= The gold coin weighed on average 2.5-2.8 grams and was 15–21 mm in diameter at the start of issue, in 270-300. This would make it half an Aureus which weighed 4.62-6.51 grams at the time of Probus. The issue of Israel (570-600) weighed 1.5 grams and was 17 mm in diameter. The Roman solidus of Maurice Tiberius was 4.36-4.47 grams. A majority of these coins were found in South Arabia and not Aksum. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an AU Unit. =Silver coinage= Also starting with Endubis these coins were 2.11-2.5 grams in weight which is half the weight of a Roman antoninianus of 3.5-4.5 grams. A Denarius in the early 3rd century was 2.5-3.00 grams of 52 percent or less of silver, but the Aksum coins were almost pure silver at first later debased. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an AR Unit. =Base coinage= Most bronze and silver coins have mainly been found in Aksum territory, with very few pieces found in Judea, Meroë and Egypt. They are based roughly on the size of older Roman As and Sestertius in shape and thickness. The design also developed like Roman coins in first being good but then the pictures turn archaic and non recognisable. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an Æ diameter in mm Unit, like Æ17 for a coin of 17 mm. Trade At the time of Aksum's minting of currency, the state already had a long trade history with Greece, Rome, the Persian Empire, and India. That coinage began so late is in fact a little surprising. The late use of coinage may be attributed to the lack of a developed economy, required for coinage to be accepted. Most Aksumite coins were found in the large trade centres with very few in remote villages, where trade would be more through barter and not coinage based. In fact, the motivation for Aksum's initial minting of coins was for foreign trade and markets, as evidenced by the use of Greek on most of its coins. Moreover, gold coins seem to have been intended primarily for external trade, while copper and silver coins probably mainly circulated within the Aksumite empire, as the gold issues generally specified \\"king of the Aksumites\\" as title of the Aksumite king, whereas the title of silver and copper issues generally only read \\"king.\\"Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 153. International use of Aksumite coins seems to have begun early on, as coins of King Ezana and even of King Aphilas (the second Aksumite ruler to issue coins) have been found in India.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 31 n.18. Decline During the 7th century, Aksumite power began to fail, and Ethiopian society began to withdraw further into the highland hinterlands, with the coastal areas becoming peripheral areas (whereas Adulis on the coast was once the second city of Aksum). The coins continued circulation, but were restricted to more local areas such as Nubia, South Arabia and the Horn of Africa. Archaeology Due to the nature of the coins (e.g. providing kings' names), they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98 percent of the city of AksumIslam Online. \\"Axum: The Ancient Civilization of Ethiopia\\". Accessed 21 July 2006. remains unexcavated, and other areas even more so. Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins, archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, generally agreed upon until the late 6th- and 7th-century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, who happen to be the most famous kings: Ezana and Kaleb, both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity during the height of the Aksumite kingdom. Many coins have been found in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, the central region of Aksum, though Aksumite coins are reported to have been found in Arato and Lalibela. Many coins have been also found further afield. Numerous hoards of coins (always gold save one silver coin) have been found in Southern Arabia, much more than in Aksum itself, attesting perhaps to an Aksumite presence in parts of the region (perhaps supporting the use of titles claiming control over parts of South Arabia from GDRT's time). The hoards may be the remnants of hoards left in Kaleb's time (perhaps used to pay soldiers), when it was under an Aksumite governor. Outside of the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula, coins have been found as far as Israel, Meroe, Egypt, and India. Silver and copper coins are mainly found in Aksum, though some can be traced to Palestinian pilgrim centers. In addition to historical evidence, the coins' use of Ge'ez provides valuable linguistic information. Though rarely used, the vocalization of Ge'ez sometimes employed on Aksumite coins allows linguists to analyze vowel changes and shifts that cannot be represented in the older Semitic abjads such as Hebrew, Arabic, South Arabian, and earlier, unvocalized Ge'ez.

This never happened at the academic level, though. All these policies became less strict and more permissive as time passed. Evolution The Press Law of Manuel Fraga Iribarne replaced the pre-publication censorship with after-the-fact punishments.

Kagawa wrote, spoke, and worked at length on ways to employ Christian principles in the ordering of society and in cooperatives. His vocation to help the poor led him to live among them. He advocated for women's suffrage and promoted a peaceful foreign policy. Early life Kagawa was born in Kobe, Japan to a philandering businessman and a concubine. Both parents died while he was young. He was sent away to school, where he learned from two American missionary teachers, Drs. Harry W. Myers and Charles A. Logan, who took him into their homes. Kagawa learned English from these missionaries and converted to Christianity after taking a Bible class in his youth, which led to his being disowned by his remaining extended family. Kagawa studied at Tokyo Presbyterian College, and later enrolled in Kobe Theological Seminary. While studying there, Kagawa was troubled by the seminarians' concern for technicalities of doctrine. He believed that Christianity in action was the truth behind Christian doctrines. Impatiently, he would point to the parable of the Good Samaritan.Axling,William.Kagawa.Harper and Brothers Publishers. New York and London. 1946.Chapter 3. p 28-41 From 1914 to 1916 he studied at Princeton Theological Seminary. In addition to theology, through the university's curricular exchange program he also studied embryology, genetics, comparative anatomy, and paleontology while at Princeton.Anri Morimoto, \\"The Forgotten Prophet: Rediscovering Toyohiko Kagawa,\\" The Princeton Seminary Bulletin, Vol. 28, No. 3 (2007), 303. Activism In 1909 Kagawa moved into a Kobe slum with the intention of acting as a missionary, social worker, and sociologist. In 1914 he went to the United States to study ways of combating the sources of poverty. In 1916 he published Researches in the Psychology of the Poor based on this experience in which he recorded many aspects of slum society that were previously unknown to middle-class Japanese. Among these were the practices of illicit prostitution (i.e., outside of Japan's legal prostitution regime), informal marriages (which often overlapped with the previous category), and the practice of accepting money to care for children and then killing them. Kagawa was arrested in Japan in 1921 and again in 1922 for his part in labour activism during strikes. While in prison he wrote the novels Crossing the Deathline and Shooting at the Sun. The former was a semi-autobiographical depiction of his time among Kobe's destitute. After his release, Kagawa helped organize relief work in Tokyo following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and assisted in bringing about universal adult male suffrage in 1925. He organized the Japanese Federation of Labour as well as the National Anti-War League in 1928. Throughout this period, he continued to evangelize to Japan's poor, advocate women's suffrage and call for a peaceful foreign policy. Between 1926 and 1934 he focused his evangelical work through the Kingdom of God Movement. Arthur Miller writes about hearing Kagawa give an evangelical lecture in Hill Auditorium at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, in 1935, and describes him as \\"a merchant of the sublime.\\"Arthur Miller, Timebends: A Life, Methuen, 1987, p.99 In 1940, Kagawa made an apology to the Republic of China for Japan's occupation of China, and was arrested again for this act. After his release, he went back to the United States in a futile attempt to prevent war between that nation and Japan. He then returned to Japan to continue his attempts to win women's suffrage. After Japan's surrender, Kagawa was an adviser to the transitional Japanese government. During his life, Kagawa wrote over 150 books. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1947 and 1948, and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1955. Health and death In Osaka, March, 1955, Kagawa suffered collapse from his deteriorating heart, and remained bedridden for 2 weeks. He continued writing, preaching, overseeing projects, and hosting guests, despite concerns from his family and associates. Kagawa's condition worsened throughout the years, and he was hospitalized again, for 3 months in 1959, at Saint Luke's Hospital in Takamatsu. Kagawa remained bedridden at home for most of his time in Matsuzawa. His health gradually improved in mid-April, then worsened again. On April 23, Kagawa was unconscious for 3 hours, then woke and smiled to his wife and others around him, his last words being \\"Please do your best for world peace and the church in Japan.\\"Schildgen, Robert, \\"Toyohiko Kagawa\\", California: Centenary Books, 1988 Brotherhood economics Kagawa's economic theory, as expressed in the book Brotherhood Economics, advocated that the Christian Church, the cooperative movement, and the peace movement unite in a 'powerful working synthesis' to provide a workable alternative to capitalism, state socialism, and fascism. Kagawa's work in the co-operative movement consisted of founding several consumer co-operatives in 1921, including the Co-op Kobe, Nada Consumer Co-operative (later merged with Co-op Kobe), the Kyoto Consumer Co- operative, Tokyo Student's Consumer Co-operative and Tokyo Iryou (Medical) Consumer Co-operative. Three-dimensional forestry While studying at Princeton University, Kagawa read Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture by Joseph Russell Smith. Inspired by this book, he managed to persuade many of Japan's upland farmers during the 1930s that the solution to their soil erosion problem lay in widespread tree-planting. Kagawa also advised that they could receive further benefit if they planted crop trees, such as quick- maturing walnuts, to provide feed for their pigs. The planting of fruit and nut trees on farmland aims to conserve the soil, supply food for humans and provide fodder for animals, the three \\"dimensions\\" of his system. Kagawa was a forerunner of modern forest farming and an inspiration to Robert Hart who pioneered forest gardening in temperate climates. Legacy After his death, Kagawa was awarded the second-highest honor of Japan, induction in the Order of the Sacred Treasure. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorates him as a renewer of society on April 23; Kagawa is also honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) and on the Calendar of the Presbyterian Church (USA) on that day. Famous quotes * On the morning of 1946, at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, before Emperor Hirohito, \\"Whosoever will be great among you... shall be the servant of all. A ruler's sovereignty, Your Majesty, is in the hearts of the people. Only by service to others can a man, or nation, be godlike.\\" * \\"Communism's only power is to diagnose some of the ills of disordered society. It has no cure. It creates only an infantile paralysis of the social order.\\" * \\"I read in a book that a man called Christ went about doing good. It is very disconcerting to me that I am so easily satisfied with just going about.\\" * \\"It seemed that everyone was attacking me – the Soviet Communists, the anarchists, the capitalists, the foul-mouthed literary critics, the sensationalist newspaper men, the Buddhist who could not compete with Christ, and those many Christians who profess Christ but believe in a Christianity which is sterile.\\" See also * List of civil rights leaders * Japanese dissidence during the Shōwa period Writings * Love - The Law of Life.

It publishes ten daily newspapers in five cities, including the leading newspapers in Mexico's three largest cities: Reforma in Mexico City, El Norte in Monterrey and Mural in Guadalajara. It also publishes the daily Metro in Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Puebla and Toluca, and the afternoon tabloid El Sol in Monterrey. The average daily circulation of all these papers is 1.4 million copies. The group also owns the largest content- intensive web sites in Mexico: reforma.com, elnorte.com, and mural.com. It owns the largest newswire service with Mexican information, Agencia Reforma. Cancha, a tabloid with Mexican sports and entertainment news, is published biweekly in Las Vegas in partnership with The Las Vegas Review-Journal. Grupo Reforma also has strategic alliances with leading US dailies to publish their information in its papers, including a daily section of The Wall Street Journal and a weekly section of The New York Times. History The Grupo Reforma headquarters in Mexico City Grupo Reforma was created by Alejandro Junco de la Vega and Rodolfo Junco Jr. from the merger of two companies, Editora el Sol S.A. and Ediciones del Norte S.A. The newsgroup was started with the founding of El Sol in April 1922, followed by El Norte in 1938, Monterrey's Metro in 1988, Reforma in 1993, Palabra and Mexico City's Metro in 1997, Mural in 1998, Saltillo's Metro in 2004 and Guadalajara's Metro in 2005. Reforma was an offshoot of El Norte, the noted Monterrey-based daily. Grupo Reforma was the first newsgroup in Mexico to separate its commercial division from its journalism division. This allows for a greater independence, and helps journalists resist the temptation of writing articles favorable to sponsors. When it was founded on November 20, the newspaper pressured unionized newsstands to sell the paper that day. Since November 20 is the Día de la Revolución (Day of the Revolution), an obligatory public holiday in México, the unions refused, so Reforma was sold on the streets by journalists and celebrities as a protest against what they considered \\"a boycott\\". Reforma changed the traditional distribution of newspapers with its independence from the unionized newsstands and printed media resellers. It also was innovative because of the inclusion of people of all political opinions in its editorial pages. Grupo Reforma's independent journalism drew the ire of the powerful Mexico City carrier union barely a year after it was born. This syndicate controls distribution of all newspapers in the capital city and was traditionally used by the political system to bring down any paper that was deemed unacceptable. The carrier union boycotted the distribution of Reforma in Mexico City in October 1994. Grupo Reforma decided to create an independent distribution channel to sell Reforma on the city streets. The support of the readers was incredible: intellectuals, artists and regular folks joined Reforma's personnel in the process of creating this channel. Dozens of people took to the streets to sell the paper, despite the verbal and even physical violence of the carrier union. Currently, Reforma is distributed independently to the homes of 85,000 subscribers, to supermarkets and other retail outlets and to readers in Mexico city's streets. The paper's daily circulation averages 200,000. Grupo Reforma's dailies have an open journalism model that is very different from any newspaper in the world. One of the cornerstones of this model is the editorial board. Each section of every paper has an editorial board composed of readers and leaders in the section's area of interest who get together weekly or bi-monthly to set the section's editorial agenda. For example, the editorial board of Reforma's national section may include a diputado (member of house of representatives), a senator, several politicians, some members of non-governmental organizations, as well as regular readers. The boards have complete liberty of action in setting what is covered. The board is led by each section's editor, the person who is directly responsible for the daily operation of the section. Each board session is divided in two parts. First, the board members critique the content published in the section since the last time they met. What was done right? What needs to be corrected? What was plainly wrong? These and other similar topics are covered. Second, the discussion centers on the work ahead. What stories should the section be working on? Who should the paper be interviewing? Are there any events that should be covered? It is in this part of the meeting that the editorial agenda is defined. Each year, 850 people make up the 70 editorial boards that define the editorial agenda for all of Grupo Reforma's papers. More than eight thousand people have been members of an editorial board during the 15 years that they have been in operation. Participation is voluntary, so no payment is given. The boards are revamped each year, but a couple of members are chosen to stay on to deal with any unfinished work in progress. Every quarter, the editor gives his/her board a balance of all the suggestions they have provided and how they have been implemented in the section. Criticism The journalism model of Grupo Reforma has drawn many attacks, both verbal and physical, from politicians and other powerful groups whose interests have been affected by the stories during its 85-year tenure.

The marque was named after Albert Russel Erskine (1871–1933), Studebaker's president at the time. During his term as president, Erskine encouraged Studebaker engineers to develop advanced engines. As a result, the company achieved numerous racing wins and a bigger share of the upper-price market. This left Studebaker without an entry level automobile in the United States, and Erskine, who had always been fascinated by smaller European vehicles, saw market potential in a short- wheel-base compact car, especially if it could expand Studebaker's presence in the European market. The Erskine Six was therefore first launched in Paris.Longstreet, Stephen A Century on Wheels: The Story of Studebaker, New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1952, p. 91 When introduced in time for the American 1927 model year, the car was named after its creator, and marketed as The Little Aristocrat. To make the Erskine affordable, Studebaker fitted the cars with six-cylinder Continental engines rather than the more advanced Studebaker units and priced the cars at $995. Body design was by Ray Dietrich; the design proved to be quite a head-turner, and received numerous accolades from the British and French press. Initially, sales demand was promising. However, within a year Ford introduced its Model A and priced it at $525, undercutting the Erskine by $470. To remedy this, Studebaker marketing suggested that the Erskine become a larger car which, when implemented, grew the wheelbase from to . The Erskine was no longer small, and became more like its Studebaker brethren. Ultimately, the Erskine was absorbed into Studebaker by May 1930. A little over a year later, Studebaker would try again with the 1931 Rockne brand automobile. To his credit, Albert Russel Erskine successfully strengthened Studebaker’s core automobile business and helped to guide the corporation toward technical advancements that eventually would help the company through the first few years of the depression. However Erskine also encouraged the payment of stockholder dividends from Studebaker’s capital reserves as the depression deepened; this inflated the value of the stock, and eventually weakened the company. In addition to the two failed marques he created (Rockne and Erskine), Erskine also had purchased luxury car maker Pierce-Arrow during the high rolling 1920s, which had to be sold off to investors as a means of improving cash flow. Faced with loss of control of Studebaker, Albert Russel Erskine committed suicide in 1933 on the Studebaker proving grounds (now Bendix Woods Park) outside of South Bend, Indiana.

This thesis is the culmination of three years of extensive study on Socrates, as seen from the view point of Xenophon, Aristophanes, and Plato.\\"Reflections on Kierkegaard's Socrates\\" by H. Sarf, Journal of the History of Ideas, 1983. His thesis dealt with irony, and in particular, Socratic irony. In Part One, Kierkegaard regards Aristophanes' portrayal of Socrates, in Aristophanes' The Clouds to be the most accurate representation of the man. Whereas Xenophon and Plato portrayed Socrates seriously, Kierkegaard felt that Aristophanes best understood the intricacies of Socratic irony. In the shorter Part Two of the dissertation, Kierkegaard compares Socratic irony with contemporary interpretations of irony. Here, he offers analysis of major 19th century writers and philosophers including Fichte, Schlegel, and Hegel. One English translation of the book also contains his notes on Schelling's Berlin Lectures of 1841, which Kierkegaard attended shortly after finishing his dissertation.

The Warsaw store was the very first department store in Poland. Founded in 1884 in Warsaw by Aniela Jabłkowska, from 1892 it was a Jabłkowski family business. Initially run by Aniela, the company specialized in the trade of various goods, mostly clothes. In 1897, it was taken over by Aniela's brother Józef Jabłkowski. It was Józef who expanded the business significantly, moving it to a larger building in 1900 and in 1913 the Towarzystwo Akcyjne Bracia Jabłkowscy company entered the stock exchange. Initially owning a group of smaller shops all around Russian-held Poland, in 1914 the company built the first of its large department stores in downtown Warsaw, at Bracka Street. In 1919, after World War I, the company opened another store in Mickiewicz Street, the main avenue of Wilno. The department store building in the Gediminas Avenue of Vilnius, Lithuania (as of 2006) The Warsaw-based store was the largest shop in Poland and both stores were considered to be among the most luxurious and reputable in Poland, much like their foreign counterparts, Galeries Lafayette, Harrods or Selfridges. There were tourist attractions of both cities. The company dealt with garments, underwear, textiles, silk, bedding, china, perfumes, as well as shoes, furs and articles for daily use. In addition, both stores housed art galleries and small cinemas. After the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 Wilno was seized by the Soviets, who confiscated the shop and transported most of its goods to the Soviet Union. The store in Warsaw was initially closed by the new German administration. It was reopened in February 1940, but its turnover was seriously restricted by the limits on the textile trade. After the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, the store at Bracka street became one of the arsenals for the Armia Krajowa. Damaged and burnt, the building survived World War II and in May 1945 the business was reopened. Despite severe shortages of practically everything, the staff gradually rose to 220 and the turnover reached half of the pre-war level. It also served as an UNRRA aid distribution point. However, during the so-called 'battle for trade', on May 15, 1950, the communist authorities confiscated the shop and closed it down the following year. Since then the building has housed a variety of state-owned shops, including the Central House of a Child dealing with toys and children's wear (1951–1970) and then, since 1992, the Arka store. Despite being non-existent, the brand remained well known in post-war Poland and was a symbol of pre-war luxury and quality. After Poland regained its independence from the Eastern Bloc in 1989, the heirs of the Jabłkowski family started their efforts to regain the building and reopen the store. In 1996 a court verdict declared the decisions of the communist tribunals null and void, and the future of the building was discussed. The Court supported the right to ownership by the Jabłkowscy family. On September 11, 2013, Jabłkowski brothers Jan and Tomasz (grandsons of Józef), Marta and Magda (daughters of Jan Jabłkowski) entered the building following a court verdict. They were accompanied by solicitors, film crew, carpenters and locksmiths as well as twenty-six security officers. Jan Jabłkowski, aided by his family, had struggled for the return of the family's celebrated department store since the fall of Communism in 1989. Since the return of the store in 2013, the family has been working closely with architects, conservationists and planners to modernise the facilities in the historic building whilst retaining the iconic stained-glass windows and the atrium area. Potential companies are being examined so that store will be able to offer, yet again, a unique retail experience for its customers. The opening date for the store is to be confirmed.

He was awarded the National Medal of Science for engineering. Early life Newmark was born in Plainfield, New Jersey to a Jewish couple, Abraham and Mollie Newmark. After receiving his early education in North Carolina and New Jersey, he went on to attend Rutgers University. Newmark graduated from Rutgers in 1930 earning High Honors and Special Honors in civil engineering. He married Anne Cohen in 1931. Newmark then attended graduate school at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign where he worked under Hardy Cross, Harold M. Westergaard, and Frank E. Richart. At the University of Illinois In 1932 he received a M.S. degree and in 1934 a Ph.D. degrees for thesis titled Interaction between rib and superstructure in concrete arch bridges, in civil engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. After graduating from UIUC, Newmark was appointed to many prestigious positions in the department. He became Research Professor of Civil Engineering in 1943. He served as Chairman of the Digital Computer Laboratory of the University from 1947 to 1957 and in 1956 he was appointed head of the Civil Engineering Department and held the position until 1973. Newmark held many important leadership positions and the reputation of the longest tenure on the University Research Board. He continued as a professor there until he retired with a rank of Professor Emeritus. Under his leadership, the program at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign soared to new heights. The civil engineering laboratory on campus now bears his name. Newmark was the advisor or coadvisor of the following students who completed their Ph.D. in Civil Engineering, Graduate College, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign:Structural and Geotechnical Mechanics: A Volume Honoring Nathan M. Newmark, Editor: W. J. Hall, 1977 Achievements During World War II Newmark consulted for the National Defense Research Committee and the Office of Scientific Research and Development, for which in 1948 he received the President's Certificate of Merit. He served on numerous Department of Defense boards and panels, with major contributions to the Minute Man and MX missile systems. In 1959, Newmark introduced what became known as the Newmark-beta method of numerical integration Newmark, N. M. (1959) A method of computation for structural dynamics. Journal of Engineering Mechanics, ASCE, 85 (EM3) 67-94. used to solve differential equations. The method is still widely used in numerical evaluation of the dynamic response of structures and solids, such as in Finite element analysis. He later helped to develop the first digital computers, the ILLIAC II, which was one of the first transistorized computers. It was also designed to use transistors that were not even invented yet. The ILLIAC-II eventually led to the development of computer software for engineering. Another of Newmark's achievements was the Torre Latinoamericana (Latin American Tower) in Mexico City, Mexico, the tallest building in Mexico City until 1984. Newmark was the consulting engineer on the project. He designed the building to be supported by the muddy soil underneath the structure and be able to withstand earthquakes. The design was put to the test in 1957 when an earthquake struck the city, and again in the stronger earthquake of 1985. The Torre Latinoamericana withstood the quakes and is still standing today as a witness of progress in earthquake engineering. He also developed the seismic design criteria for other large projects including the Bay Area Rapid Transit System, Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, the proposed Alaskan Natural Gas Pipeline, and about 70 nuclear power plants. Throughout his career Newmark developed a simple, yet powerful and widely used method for analyzing complex structural components and assemblies under a variety of conditions of loading and for calculating the stresses and deformations in soil beneath foundations. He also was an engineer on the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Since there was an oil and energy shortage, high unemployment rate, and high inflation in the 1970s, the country had to do something to help conserve and utilize the natural resources available to them inside the country. Once oil was discovered in Alaska, there was a need for a design to get the oil quickly and efficiently down to the refineries. The Alaskan terrain offered many diverse challenges for a normal underground pipeline, thus Newmark was consulted to design sections of the pipeline near the fault lines. Since Newmark had done numerous studies on the effect of earthquakes on structures, he had the ideal background to tackle such a revolutionary feat. Newmark also made significant contributions to geotechnical engineering. He developed a new method, named after him (Newmark's sliding block method) Newmark, N. M. (1965) Effects of earthquakes on dams and embankments. Geotechnique, 15 (2) 139-160. of calculating displacements in earth dams and slopes due to earthquakes. His work was acknowledged with an invitation to deliver the 5th Rankine Lecture of the British Geotechnical Association, entitled Effects of earthquakes on dams and embankments. The American Concrete Institute awarded Newmark the Wason Medal for Most Meritorious Paper in 1950. In 1968, he was recipient of the National Medal of Science for Engineering Sciences. He was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1962), and received the 1979 John Fritz Medal and several other awards. The American Society of Civil Engineers has named a medal after him, which is awarded \\"to a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers who, through contributions in structural mechanics, has helped substantially to strengthen the scientific base of structural engineering.\\" In 1964 he contributed to the founding the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and two years later became a member of National Academy of Sciences (NAS). Hardy Cross Hardy Cross, who Newmark worked under at the University of Illinois in Urbana, developed the moment distribution method. It enabled designers to calculate statically indeterminate frames of reinforced concrete. Newmark looked up to Cross; in Cross's book Arches, Continuous Frames, Columns and Conduits, Newmark wrote the introduction, in which he tells how much he enjoyed the classes taught by Cross and how they would sometimes walk home together after classes and discuss engineering principles.

System Architect is used to build architectures using various frameworks including TOGAF, ArchiMate, DoDAF, MODAF and NAF. System Architect is developed by UNICOM Systems, a division of UNICOM Global, a United States-based company.  Overview  Enterprise architecture (EA) is a mechanism for understanding all aspects of the organization, and planning for change. Those aspects include business transformation, business process rationalization, business or capability-driven solution development, application rationalization, transformation of IT to the cloud, server consolidation, service management and deployment, building systems of systems architectures, and so forth. Most simply, users use EA and System Architect to build diagrammatic and textual models of any and all aspects of their organization, including the who, what, where, when, why, and how things are done so they can understand the current situation, and plan for the future. Parts of the EA can be harvested from existing sources of information in the organization—auto-discovery of network architectures, database architectures, etc. The users building the models are typically enterprise architects, business architects, business analysts, data architects, software architects, and so forth. This information can be viewed by all stakeholders of the organization — including its workers, management, and outside vendors (depending on the level of access they have been granted to the information), through generation of the information to a static website, or enabling direct web-access to the information in the repository. The stakeholders can use this information to get answers to questions about the organization's architecture in the form of visual diagrams and reports that produce textual information, pie charts, and other dashboards. System Architect is widely used in developing defense architectures. The Architecture Development and Analysis Survey, conducted by MITRE Corporation for the US Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks & Information Integration (OASD NII) and revealed at the CISA worldwide conference on December 1, 2005, reported that out of 96 programs building DoDAF architectures responding to the survey, 77% used System Architect, either by itself (48%) or in conjunction with another modeling tool (29%).The US Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (NII) Architecture Development and Analysis Survey, conducted by MITRE Corporation, and presented at the CISA worldwide conference on December 1, 2005. System Architect has been referenced in textbooks written in the field of enterprise architecture, UML, and data modeling, and was also used to build some or all of the models that appear in some of these books. History System Architect was initially created and developed by Jan Popkin under the auspices of Popkin Software. System Architect was one of the first Windows-based computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools. It evolved through the years to become an enterprise architecture modeling tool — one that enables the end user to utilize many notations and methods to model aspects of their organization in a repository, and disseminate this information to a large audience. Telelogic acquired Popkin Software in April, 2005 and IBM acquired Telelogic in 2008. After acquisition of Telelogic, IBM included System Architect (and all other Telelogic products) in the Rational division, named after Rational Software, which it acquired in 2003. On January 1, 2016, IBM announced that UNICOM Global had acquired System Architect from IBM, and that its core development and support team, which originated at Popkin Software, was joining UNICOM Systems to continue to build the product line.

For SQL Server, the information is stored in a database on the server; this database is considered a repository of information and in System Architect parlance is called an encyclopedia. For Oracle, the repository, or ‘encyclopedia’, is a schema on the Oracle database server. Users build the models working together in teams on the network. In this multi-user environment, as one user opens a model artifact to edit it, other users get a read-only version of this artifact. Options exist to enable users to check out multiple artifacts so that they can work on sections of the architecture without anyone else modifying it while they work on it, and administrators to freeze artifacts so that they are ‘set in stone’. Users may also work in a stand-alone configuration using SQL Server 2005 Express on their laptop or workstation. A SQL-based query reporting language enables users to build and run reports to answer questions about the information they have modeled, such as what business processes are related to what organizational goals, what applications are used to perform what business processes, what business processes operate on what data entities, what user has modified what information on what date, and so forth. The information captured in the repository is done so against a metamodel that acts as a template for information to capture and how it is all related. Users may customize this meta model, to change or add to the template of information they wish to capture and how things are interrelated. Models are typically published to a website so that they can be viewed by a wide audience. An add- on tool called SA/Publisher is used to publish websites based on SQL-based queries of the repository using System Architect’s reporting language. System Architect DoDAF, UAF, MODAF, and NAF System Architect provides support for the diagrams, matrices, and work products required to be captured for the US Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) version 2.02 (as well as features of the never-officially-released 2.03 version), the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF), the NATO Architecture Framework (NAF) version 3, older versions of DoDAF -- DoDAF 1.5 standard and DoDAF 1.5 ABM (supporting the Activity Based Method as specified by MITRE), and the UK Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework (MODAF). System Architect ArchiMate Starting with release 11.4.4.1, System Architect has native support for ArchiMate 3.0 through a licensed add-on. This is a different add- on than a \\"Ready For Rational\\" plugin produced by IBM Business Partner Corso for the ArchiMate 2.0 language. SA/XT System Architect XT (where XT denotes eXtended Team) is a sister product to System Architect rich client, providing a pure web interface to read and write access to the repository via a browser. SA XT enables remote users with a web browser to browse the repository, run reports against it to ask it questions, and add information into it, including adding definition information, and editing or creating diagrams.

Modesto Junior College (MJC) is a public community college in Modesto, California. It is part of Yosemite Community College District along with Columbia College. MJC, and Columbia College, belong to the California Community College system along with 112 other public community colleges. The college has two campuses in Modesto. The East Campus is the original campus while the West Campus is the larger of the two. Courses are provided in general education, lower-division transfer programs, occupational and developmental education. MJC is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC).  History  Modesto Junior College can trace its roots to the decision by the California State Legislature in 1907 to authorize high schools to create junior colleges what were termed \\"postgraduate courses of study\\" similar to the courses offered in just the first two years of university studies. Shortly after the decision by the legislature, Fresno City College was formed 96 miles south of Modesto. Due to the success of Fresno City College, the state legislature passed legislation in 1921 allowing for the creation of community college districts. Modesto Junior College, founded in September 1921, became the first community college district. Modesto Junior College started out with only 61 students but has since expanded to over 19,000 students. In addition to enrollment increases, the school has expanded to having two campuses MJC West and MJC East along with more than 20 community sites throughout the Yosemite College District that are used to meet particular education needs. In 2015, it was announced that Modesto Junior College would become one of the first community colleges in California to offer Bachelor of Science degrees. The college will offer a bachelor of science degree in respiratory care starting in 2017.  Campus  The entrance to the main auditorium of Modesto Junior College's Performing Arts CenterThere are two Modesto Junior College campuses; MJC East and MJC West. MJC East is 58.3 arces and MJC West is 167.1 acres – between both campuses, there are 6 large scale agricultural units, 7 (agriculture student) housing units, 74 buildings, 370 rooms including 15 athletic areas, 104 classrooms, 36 common use areas, 21 computer labs, 12 conference rooms, 99 lab classrooms, 16 lectures halls and 10 performance rooms.  Administration  The college is part of the Yosemite Community College District within the California Community Colleges System. The current college president is Dr. James Houpis. The district is governed by an elected seven-member Board of Trustees.  Academics  Modesto Junior College offers Associate Degrees. The school boasts 19,262 students and is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

The dish consists of soft dough biscuits covered in either sawmill or meat gravy, made from the drippings of cooked pork sausage, white flour, milk, and often (but not always) bits of sausage, bacon, ground beef, or other meat. The gravy is often flavored with black pepper. History The meal emerged as a distinct regional dish after the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), when stocks of foodstuffs were in short supply. Breakfast was necessarily the most substantial meal of the day in the South, for a person facing a day of work on the plantations. In addition, the lack of supplies and money meant it had to be cheap. Restaurant chains specializing in biscuits and gravy are found in North Carolina, which has Biscuitville, and West Virginia, which has Tudor's Biscuit World. Starting in 2015 McDonald's offered an all-day breakfast menu which served their traditional muffins in most of the United States, but limited biscuits mostly to the southeastern United States.Why is the All Day Breakfast Menu different in some locations?Do You Live in a Biscuit/McGriddles or McMuffin Area? Variations While biscuits and gravy generally refers to sausage gravy, it can also refer to egg gravy, made in one of two ways: * by scrambling eggs in bacon grease (dripping), then adding flour and milk to make gravy, and adding crumbled bacon back to the mixture * by making a basic roux, creating a brown gravy base, then whisking beaten eggs into the boiling gravy Tomato gravy is white gravy mixed with crushed or diced tomatoes.

They gather mostly at the top because aerobic respiration generates more ATP than either fermentation or anaerobic respiration. 4: Microaerophiles need oxygen because they cannot ferment or respire anaerobically. However, they are poisoned by high concentrations of oxygen. They gather in the upper part of the test tube but not the very top. 5: Aerotolerant organisms do not require oxygen as they metabolise energy anaerobically. Unlike obligate anaerobes however, they are not poisoned by oxygen. They can be found evenly spread throughout the test tube. Aerotolerant anaerobes use fermentation to produce ATP. They do not utilize oxygen, but they can protect themselves from reactive oxygen molecules. In contrast, obligate anaerobes can be harmed by reactive oxygen molecules. There are three categories of anaerobes. Where obligate aerobes require oxygen to grow, obligate anaerobes are damaged by oxygen, aerotolerant organisms cannot use oxygen but tolerate its presence, and facultative anaerobes use oxygen if it is present but can grow without it. Aerotolerant anaerobes have superoxide dismutase and peroxidase but don't have catalase. An example of an aerotolerant anaerobe is Propionibacterium acnes.

It competed with entry level luxury 4-door hardtop sedans that were popular in Japan during the 1990s, notably the Toyota Corolla Ceres, the Toyota Sprinter Marino, the Honda Integra, and the Mazda Lantis. \\"Presea\\" is Spanish for \\"jewel\\" or \\"important\\".  R10 (1990–1995)  Nissan Presea The original R10 Presea was based on the B13 series Nissan Sunny platform, and replaced the Nissan Laurel Spirit. It continued to be a smaller companion to the Nissan Laurel of this time period, sharing much of the styling influences and attention to luxury in a smaller package. Its appearance was also very similar to the much larger Nissan President. Like the Laurel, it was exclusive to Nissan Japanese dealerships called Nissan Motor Store. It shared many attributes with its sibling model, however, body panels and interior were done to a much higher specification. Interior fabrics matched those on the Laurel, with standard features including automatic headlights, lighted keyslot, rear- illuminated instrument cluster, integrated sound-system, automatic climate control, digital temperature control, adjustable shoulder height seat-belts, 4-way adjustments, lumbar support for the driver's seat, windscreen wipers with adjustable intermittent timings, remotely controlled wing mirrors that folded close and most importantly, frameless windows that mimicked the NX Coupe and Silvia. In fact, so feature-full and advanced was the car that many units had 4-disc brakes with ABS and a rear windscreen wiper. The engines offered were shared with the Nissan Pulsar and the Nissan NX two-door coupes. The A-pillar was slightly thinner than most compact cars, and the B-Pillar was practically non-existent from the outside, and on the inside, it was just wide enough to accommodate the seat-belt assembly. The C-pillar created a wrap- around rear windscreen. All these design features allowed for a more than 300-degree of vision for the driver, much like that of a fighter pilot. The rounded exterior left no visible straight edge on the car, and the grill-less front end gave the car a very sleek and futuristic look, with some visual similarities to the Infiniti Q45.  R11 (1995–2000)  1995 Nissan Presea The R11 Presea launched in 1995 was slightly lengthened. In some countries including Japan, the venerable SR18DE with 125 hp replaced the 110 hp SR18D(i) engine, alongside GA15DE and SR20DE engines. It still had the same drive-train as Nissan Sunny B14 (1994–1998) and the same frame-less door windows as the R10 Nissan Presea, although it was a little longer (4425 mm + 2525 mm wheelbase) wider (1695 mm) and taller (1325 mm). In Singapore, Thailand and New Zealand, the R11 Presea came predominantly with the ancient 1.6L GA16DE. With essentially every curve and panel being unchanged, and only a fresher looking headlights and rear lamp cluster the car still had the same old MacPherson struts suspension up front and rear multi link geometry. Market demand for such a car fell rapidly, as the economic recession in Japan began to take full effect, known in Japan as the Lost Decade and the Presea was also cancelled after review under Nissan Revival Plan. Specifications =Dimensions= The Presea was another clone of the Sunny/Pulsar, part of Nissan's strategy of selling the Sunny at one of five Nissan Japanese dealerships. The car was in compliance with Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement size, offering buyers higher luxury content of the larger Bluebird/Stanza/Auster/Liberta, while still offering the economy and tax savings of the smaller Sunny/Pulsar. Compared to most compact cars of that time, the Nissan Presea was quite long. The R10 stood at 4420 mm, 15 centimetres longer than the Sentra. It was also rather low for a sedan at 1320 mm; with passengers often feeling the need to stoop to get into the car. At 1690 mm wide, it was as wide as it needed to be for two adults (and possibly a child) in the rear seats. The slightly longer wheelbase (compared to the Sunny) at 2500 mm was class-leading for that era of compact cars. All these dimensions added up to a comfortable (albeit low) car with decent comfort and presence. The boot space was more than adequate, at over in capacity. Due to the way the backseats lean back (which in turn gave the rear passengers a lot more comfort), objects over 1000 mm in length and 1200 mm in width could fit. The boot height of over also allowed for a competent handling of most purchases during shopping sprees. However the narrow aperture height limited its usability. =Handling= For better handling, it had MacPherson struts up front with multi-link rear suspension (with parallel arms). This independent setup combined with the longer wheelbase gave good comfort on the highway, and a pretty good grip for aggressive cornering. For many Preseas, the car was endowed with a ventilated front disc brakes with a single large piston. The rear brakes were either a solid disc brake or a semi-trailing drum brakes with self-adjusting shoes. =Engine sizes= In Japan, most Preseas came with a 1498 cc GA15DS, a 1798cc SR18Di engine, or the 1998 cc SR20DE. For the rest of the world, a more common 1598 cc GA16DE engine was available, providing sufficient grunt and fuel economy with its VTC (variable valve timing) and DOHC design. As its engine bay was slightly longer than a B13 Sentra, an SR20DET engine could be shoehorned into it without much trouble. Standard Nissan mounting points allowed for the easy swapping of clutches and gearboxes between models in this range of cars. With the ample under-bonnet capacity, larger turbos and intercoolers could be fitted provided the owner did not mind slight modifications to the engine bay. All engines offered were liable for the same amount of Japanese annual road tax.

Due to extensive filling of the bay and the creation of the Berkeley Marina, it presently extends only . Since 1937, only the first were maintained and open to the public until July 2015, when public access was closed due to safety concerns. History In the mid-19th century, two private wharves were built along the Berkeley waterfront. One was located at the foot of Addison Street one block south of University Avenue and served the Standard Soap Company, a major regional soap-making factory. The other, the Jacobs and Heywood Wharf, was located several blocks north of University Avenue at the foot of Delaware Street, used as a general freight transshipment point. In 1909, the City built a municipal wharf at the foot of University Avenue.Third Annual Report of the City Manager, 1925-26, City of Berkeley, p.31 This pier was intended for a commuter ferry which never materialized, and the pier was instead used mainly for freight. In 1925, the Golden Gate Ferry Company announced its plans to build a new ferry pier for its proposed automobile ferry service between Berkeley and San Francisco. The City of Berkeley agreed to a 50-year lease of the tidelands off the Berkeley waterfront for the construction of a new ferry pier. On January 25, 1926, the Golden Gate Ferry Company applied to the California State Railroad Commission (predecessor of the California Public Utilities Commission) for a certificate permitting it operate a ferry service between Berkeley and San Francisco.App. No. 11692: Application of Golden Gate Ferry Co. for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to operate a public ferry for the transportation of persons and property across the inland waters of the state between the city and county of San Francisco and the city of Berkeley\\", ID No. F3725:3400 On July 7, 1926, the Golden Gate Ferry Company applied to the California State Railroad Commission for a certificate permitting it operate vessels on San Francisco Bay between Berkeley and San Francisco.

(Series), ID No.F3725:3401-3403. In 1926, the Golden Gate Ferry Company began construction of the Berkeley Pier. It was built out from the foot of University Avenue, extending about into the Bay (measured from the original shoreline). The length was determined by the distance to deeper water. Nearly the entire length of the pier was paved as a two-lane road. At its end, the pier widened to accommodate vehicles waiting for a ferry. Two ferry docks were constructed. On June 16, 1927, auto ferry service beganFourth Annual Report of the City Manager, 1926-27, City of Berkeley, p.16 between the Berkeley Pier and the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco, a pier shared with the Sausalito ferry.http://webbie1.sfpl.org/multimedia/sfphotos/AAC-2256.jpg In December 1929, the Golden Gate Ferry Company and the competing auto ferry system of the Southern Pacific railroad decided to merge. They petitioned for the approval of the Railroad Commission. With the approval in hand, the new Southern Pacific-Golden Gate Ferries Ltd. was incorporated on February 18, 1929. On May 1, 1929, ferry service to San Francisco from the Berkeley Pier was taken over by the new company.Red Trains in the East Bay, by Robert Ford, pp.174-79, Interurbans Publications, 1977Ferries App. No. 15428: Application of Southern Pacific Golden Gate Ferries, Ltd., for authority (1) to acquire operative rights and properties, (2) to acquire securities of the Golden Gate Ferry Company, etc., (Series), ID No. F3725:3409 At the beginning of service, before the merger with SP, four specially-built diesel ferry boats ran every 15 minutes between Berkeley and San Francisco via the pier: The Golden Bear, the Golden Poppy, the Golden State, and the Golden Dawn, all painted yellow. Upon merging with the SP, the boats were all re-painted in the standard Southern Pacific maritime white. In August 1928, radio station KTAB, associated with the Pickwick Broadcasting Corporation, began construction of its broadcasting facilities including a large antenna tower at the pier. Between 1926 and 1937, the Pier served as an integral part of the Lincoln Highway (the first road across America), and then subsequently U.S. Route 40. The ferry line shut down on October 16, 1937,Red Trains in the East Bay, by Robert Ford, p.201, Interurbans Publications, 1977. 11 months after the Bay Bridge opened to auto traffic. Upon the cessation of ferry service, the portion of the pier closest to shore was converted to recreational use, mainly fishing. The remaining portion of the pier was left to decay, and is still visible, but inaccessible due to a barrier. There is a gap of about fifty feet at the end of the current pier to allow the passage of small boats.

Located on the banks of the lower Espinharas River, about 30 km to the North of Patos, this small town has its economy based on extensive cattle and goat raising and subsistence agriculture. Its relief is somewhat irregular, with large igneous rock outcrops and small mountains and granite inselbergs. The soil is generally poor (\\"tabuleiros\\") and covered by the caatinga vegetation, insterspersed with small valleys (\\"baixios\\") with fertile soils that support agricultural activities and are propicious to the building of small and medium-sized dams that store rain-water flowing in temporary creeks. The natural vegetation on the \\"tabuleiros\\" is well preserved as of 2005. Once a prosperous region, the lower Espinharas valley had cotton production as its main agricultural activity until about 1980. This culture was however decimated by plagues and by low prices as a result of the introduction of international competition. This caused a massive migration of the population from the rural area (\\"fazendas\\") to urban areas - mainly to Patos, São Jose de Espinharas itself and São Paulo. Competition with more favorable areas like Maranhão and Goiás, not subject to draugths, further lowered the value of the cattle assets. Further reduction in the size of the \\"fazendas\\", mostly caused by inheritance transmission, and a series of rainless years in the 1980s and 1990s contributed to the economic decline of São Jose de Espinharas - just like it did for most of the \\"Sertão\\" - the peculiar hinterlands of Northeastern Brazil.

In addition, we can say \\"Prepare something that would attract target's interest — Honeypot — And then wait to be trapped — Honeytrap\\". The band have toured widely within England, mostly around the Coventry and London areas. As a duo, the Dans have toured in New York, Spain and Japan, also under the name Honeytrap. They have released several records independently (see Discography below), but since renaming themselves they have been signed to local indie label Tough Love Records. They have released an EP, \\"The Naked Dancing EP\\", as well as their debut album, Follies In Great Cities. History Originally named Mawda, the band formed in November 2001 at the city's University of Warwick. In October 2005, the band were reborn as Honeytrap at a gig in Coventry's popular Tin Angel bar. At this point they dropped many fan favourite songs. In 2007 after a string of difficult gigs, drummer Sam Dawe called it a day to focus on his family life and career. New drummer Chris Woods was recruited via adverts on the University of Warwick's band society website. A planned whole band move to London in the summer of 2008 was scuppered by Matt Triangle, the bassist having an aversion to capital city living. Sophie Dodds or 'The Duchess' was recruited as the new bassist. Drummer Chris went AWOL and the band were left at the start of 2009 with the quandary of a doubtable future. Luckily John Bolton, who lived in the warehouse where the band practised, stepped in at first to help band record their second album Petrushka, eventually joining the band as a full member. The band also continue to play acoustic shows as a three piece, with the Duchess picking up the ukulele. Their second album Petrushka was released on 6 September 2010. Press coverage Until early 2007, the band largely operated without recognition from the national music press. However, their release, \\"Let's Do Naked Dancing\\", gained them airplay on Steve Lamacq's BBC Radio 6 show and London's XFM. Favourable reviews have also been forthcoming in low profile music magazines and websites.

Malthus wrote that all life forms, including humans, have a propensity to exponential population growth when resources are abundant but that actual growth is limited by available resources: A model of population growth bounded by resource limitations was developed by Pierre Francois Verhulst in 1838, after he had read Malthus' essay.

Kierkegaard's \\"concern was to present the various stages of existence in one work if possible.\\"Journals of Søren Kierkegaard VIIA 106 His father Michael Pedersen read Christian Wolff, and Søren himself was influenced by both Wolff and Kant to the point of using the structure and philosophical content of the three special metaphysics as a scheme for this book. But Kierkegaard wasn't satisfied until the completion of Concluding Unscientific Postscript in 1846. Here he wrote: \\"When my Philosophical Fragments had come out and I was considering a postscript to “clothe the issue in its historical costume,” yet another pseudonymous book appeared: Stages on Life’s Way, a book that has attracted the attention of only a few (as it itself predicts) perhaps also because it did not, like Either/Or, have The Seducer’s Diary, for quite certainly that was read most and of course contributed especially to the sensation. That Stages has a relation to Either/Or is clear enough and is definitely indicated by the use in the first two sections of familiar names.\\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 284 Hong. See also pp. 322-323, 625. Later in the same book he said, David F. Swenson cited this book when discussing Kierkegaard's melancholy which was corroborated by Kierkegaard's older brother Peter Christian Kierkegaard. However, Kierkegaard could have been writing about Jonathan Swift.The melancholy which was the common heritage of father and son can be described by citing a single characteristic trait. One day while herding sheep on the bare Jutland heath, embittered by his privations and oppressed by loneliness, the elder Kierkegaard, who was then a boy of eleven or twelve, had mounted a hill and assailed with curses the God who had condemned him to so wretched an existence. In Kierkegaard's journal for 1846 there is a reference to this incident in the following terms: \\"The terrible fate of the man who had once in childhood mounted a hill and cursed God, because he was hungry and cold, and had to endure privations while herding his sheep and who was unable to forget it even at the age of eighty-two.\\" When after Kierkegaard's death this passage was shown to his surviving elder brother, Bishop Peder Christian Kierkegaard, he burst into tears and said: \\"That is just the story of our father, and of his sons as well.\\" Elsewhere, in Stages on the Way of Life, Kierkegaard suggests that these dark moods served to link the father and the son in a fellowship of secret and unexpressed sympathy. Scandinavian studies and Notes 1921 p. 3Journals 71A5This is what Kierkegaard wrote in Stages on Life's Way p. 199-200 Hong: > When Swift became an old man, he was committed to the insane asylum he > himself had established when he was young. Here, it is related, he often > stood in front of a mirror with the perseverance of a vain and lascivious > woman, if not exactly with her thoughts. he looked at himself and said: Poor > old man! Once upon a time there were a father and a son. A son is like a > mirror in which the father sees himself, and for the son in turn the father > is like a mirror in which he sees himself in the time to come. Yet they > seldom looked at each other in that way, for the cheerfulness of high- > spirited, lively conversation was their daily round. Only a few times did it > happen that the father stopped, faced the son with a sorrowful countenance, > looked at him and said: Poor child, you are in a quiet despair. Nothing more > was ever said about it, how it was to be understood, how true it was. And > the father believed that he was responsible for his son’s depression, and > the son believe that it was he who caused the father sorrow-but never a word > was exchanged about this. Then the father died. And the son saw much, heard > much, experienced much, and was tried in various temptations, but he longed > for only one thing, only one thing moved him-it was that word and it was the > voice of the father when he said it. Then the son became an old man; but > just as love devised everything, so longing and loss taught him-not, of > course, to wrest any communication from the silence of eternity-but it > taught him to imitate his father’s voice until the likeness satisfied him. > Then he did not look at himself in the mirror, as did the aged Swift, for > the mirror was no more, but in loneliness he comforted himself by listening > to his father’s voice: Poor child, you are in a quiet despair. For the > father was the only one who understood him, and yet he did not know whether > he had understood him; and the father was the only intimate he had had, but > the intimacy was of such a nature that it remained the same whether the > father was alive or dead. The background is the giving of a banquet yet it seems so difficult; Constantine, from Repetition says he would never risk putting one on. Kierkegaard says, \\"repetition that involved good luck and inspiration is always a daring venture because of the ensuing comparison, an absolute requirement of richness of expression is made, since it is not difficult to repeat one's own words or to repeat a felicitously chosen phrase word for word. Consequently, to repeat the same also means to change under conditions made difficult by the precedent. By taking the risk, the pseudonymous author (Hilarius Bookbinder) has won an indirect victory over the inquisitive public. That is, when this reading public peers into the book and sees the familiar names Victor Eremita and Constantin Constantius, etc., it tosses the book aside and says wearily: It is just the same as Either/Or.\\" But Kierkegaard maintains it is the author's job to make it \\"the same, and yet changed, and yet the same\\".Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 286. He continued writing for 494 pages in Hong's translation and in his \\"Concluding Word\\" says, \\"My dear reader-but to whom am I speaking? Perhaps no one at all is left.\\"Stages on Life's Way, Hong p. 485. In Vino Veritas The subtitle is A Recollection Related by William Afham. Paul Sponheim says in his introduction to Lowrie's translation that Afham means Byhim in Danish. The book is divided rather sharply into sections, this first being the equivalent of the first part of Either/Or and is equivalent with religiousness A. \\"Religiousness A is the dialectic of inward deepening; it is the relation to an eternal happiness that is not conditioned by something but is the dialectical inward deepening of the relation, consequently conditioned only by the inward deepening, which is dialectical.\\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 556. This is the individual who is living in an esthetic way. A young man or woman who is still maturing. Still looking for the highest good. They've found love of a woman to be the highest but none have had any experience except for the seducer. Who may or not be telling the truth. Kierkegaard says, \\"Even “The Seducer’s Diary” was only a possibility of horror, which the esthete in his groping existence had conjured up precisely because he, without actually being anything, had to try his hand at everything as possibility.\\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Note p. 295. In a conscious reference to Plato's Symposium, it is determined that each participant must give a speech, and that their topic shall be love. Lee M. Hollander said, \\"it excels Plato's work in subtlety, richness, and refined humor. To be sure, Kierkegaard has charged his creation with such romantic superabundance of delicate observations and rococo ornament that the whole comes dangerously near being improbable; whereas the older work stands solidly in reality.\\"Selections from the Writings of Kierkegaard p. 29-30 University of Texas Bulletin Lee M Hollander 1923 Plato and Kierkegaard may have been testing the reader's ability to discern truth from fiction or poetry. It is possible that Plutarch's The Banquet of the Seven Wise Men may have also influenced Kierkegaard.The Banquet of the Seven Wise Men He has Victor Eremita,Victor Erimeta's Speech the Young Man,The Young Man's speech the Fashion Designer,The Dress-Maker's Speech Constantine,Constantin's Speech Johannes the SeducerJohannes the Seducer's Speech speak about love. Constantin, the psychologist, mediates between the speakers. Tellingly for the reader, however, each account given is ultimately disheartening. The inexperienced young man, for example, considers it to be simply disturbingly puzzling. To the seducer, it is a game to be won, while the foppish fashion designer considers it to be simply a style, empty of real meaning, which he can control like any other style. These individuals believe that \\"he who has hidden his life has lived well.\\" All the speakers at the banquet say \\"love is ludicrous.\\"Stages on Life's Way, Hong pp. 16−18, 36. Kierkegaard compared this section with Philine in Johann Goethe's Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship.Journals and Papers VA 82 Much of the content of \\"In vino veritas\\" will no doubt seem to be terribly sensuous; already I hear an outcry, and yet what is this compared to Goethe, for example, Philine in Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship. He took up Goethe's Dichtung und Wahrheit (My Life: Poetry and Truth) in the third section of this book, Guilty/Not-Guilty.Stages on Life's Way, Hong pp. 148−149. Goethe reflected on his life in almost all of his books. A, or the esthete, in Stages writes about reflection because Kierkegaard has found that he has made an art of recollection and reflection also. Some Reflections on Marriage in Answer to Objections — By a Married Man The second section of the book begins with the party's interruption by the nearby passing, and stopping, of a carriage containing one William Afham and his wife. He's experience speaking to possibility. Afham wants to stop A from \\"moving restlessly from possibility to possibility [because it] will ultimately end in despair.\\" Even so, Kierkegaard himself remained a bachelor all his life. But he found meaning in life that was not associated with the married state.Training in Christianity, Lowrie translation, 1941, 2004 chronology p. xxvii He says, \\"The resolution of marriage is a positive resolution and essentially the most positive of all; its opposite is also a resolution that resolves not to will to actualize the task.\\"Stages on Life's Way, p. 107. He says, \\"Ordinarily we speak only of a married man’s unfaithfulness, but what is just as bad is a married man’s lack of faith. Faith is all that is required, and faith compensates for everything. Just let understanding and sagacity and sophistication reckon, figure out, and describe how a married man ought to be: there is only one attribute that makes him lovable, and that is faith, absolute faith in marriage. Just let experience in life try to define exactly what is required of a married man’s faithfulness; there is only one faithfulness, one honesty that is truly lovable and hides everything in itself, and that is the honesty toward God and his wife and his married estate in refusing to deny the miracle.\\"Stages on Life's Way, Hong beginning on p. 90. He's against system builders in the realm of marriage just as he's against them in the realm of the religious. This section corresponds to what Kierkegaard called religiousness B. > \\"Religiousness B, or paradoxical religiousness, or religiousness that has > the dialectical in second place make conditions in such a way that the > conditions are not the dialectical concentrations of inward deepening but a > definite something that qualifies the eternal happiness more specifically > (whereas in A the more specific qualification of inward deepening is the > only more specific qualification), not by qualifying more specifically the > individual’s appropriation of it but by qualifying more specifically the > eternal happiness, yet not as a task for thinking but as paradoxically > repelling and giving rise to new pathos.\\"Concluding Unscientific Postscript, > Hong p. 556. Howard Hong said the three sections of Stages on Life's Way were meant to complement the Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions published only one day earlier. The discourse on marriage corresponds to On the Occasion of a Wedding.Stages on Life's Way, Introduction, pp. x-xi. \\"Guilty?\\"/\\"Not Guilty?\\" Victor Eremita was the pseudonymous author of Either/Or who wrote the preface to the book. In the preface he buys a writing desk in which there is a secret compartment containing the papers of A and B.See the \\"Preface\\" to Either/Or. In this book the writer of the preface, Hillarius Bookbinder, finds a small packet of papers left over from an old customer, Mr. Literatus, and parts one and two of Stages On Life's Way are found there. A repetition occurs in this third book. He's out fishing with a naturalist. He was there for the sake of science, and the author for the sake of friendship and curiosity.Stages on Life's Way, Hong p. 189. He catches something wrapped in \\"oil cloth\\" and finds a box with the papers of this section of the book inside, much like the Greeks kept hope in a box this box contained guilt. This is Quidam's Diary (Kierkegaard used _____ \\"no name\\").Stages on Life's Way, Lowrie 1967 p. 404. It is very reminiscent of Johann Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther.See the similarities by comparing Goethe's book The Sorrows of Young Werther or perhaps Either/Ors Diary of a Seducer is an imitation of Sorrows or both together. This section of the book corresponds to the third discourse from Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions published one day earlier, The Decisiveness of Death or At the Side of a Grave. The manuscript proves to be the diary of a young man written much in the style of Night Thoughts by Edward Young.Stages on Life's Way, Hong p. 216. He writes morning and evening thoughts that alternate between his guilt and his innocence. Later, in 1847 he wrote once more about this problem of guilt as he had earlier in 1843. Either/Or Part II Hong p. 341 The Upbuilding That Lies in the Thought That in Relation to God We Are Always in the Wrong and Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong P. 265 the joy of it that in relation to God a person always suffers as guilty. He believes \\"God sanctions intrigues\\" but that it would do no good for a leper to find a way to move his sores to the inside of his body. He would still be found guilty by someone.Stages on Life's Way, Hong pp. 229-231. But he sticks to his thesis with proof from Solomon's dream.Stages on Life's Way, Hong pp. 250-252. He writes about what could be interpreted as accusations against himself regarding Regine Olsen. And admits he's \\"really no religious individuality; I am just a regular and perfectly constructed possibility of such a person. With a sword hanging over my head, in peril of my life, I discover the religious crisis with a primitivity such as if I had not known of them before, with such a primitivity that if they had not been I would have to discover them.\\"Stages on Life's Way, Hong pp. 253-258. But Kierkegaard has already said he is none of the pseudonymous authors. Yet in some way he is them all. This unending guilt leads him to ask, \\"What similarity is there between her sorrow and mine, what solidarity is there between guilt and innocence, what kinship is there between repentance and an esthetic sorrow over life, when that which awakens repentance is that which awakens her sorrow? I can sorrow in my way; if she must sorrow, she must also do it on her own account. A girl may submit to a man in many things, but not in the ethical; and it is unethical for her and for me to sorrow jointly in this way. Taking this path, how will she ever come to sorrow religiously when she must leave undecided an ethical issue such as my behavior toward her, when it is indeed over its result that she wishes to sorrow. Would that I might be a woman for half a year so that I could learn how she is dissimilar to man.\\"Stages on Life's Way, Hong p. 300-303 The guilty-not guilty discussions by Marie Beaumarchais, Donna Elvira, and Margarete were written in Kierkegaard's Either/Or (1843). Marie Beaumarchais says of Goethe's Clavigo, \\"Yes, he was a deceiver. Otherwise, how could he stop loving me?\\" \\"He was no deceiver. What snatched him away, I do not know; I do not know that dark power, but it pained him personally, pained him deeply.\\" Kierkegaard understands that both men and women suffer from guilt and deception. He repeated the discussion again in the same book between Johannes the Seducer and Cordelia.See Either/Or Vol I p. 176ff. and p. 302ff. Hong translation Vol II is about a Judge who tries to help these people understand themselves. Kierkegaard took up deception as mistrust and belief in Works of Love, Hong 1995 p. 225ff. Letter to the Reader Kierkegaard finished his book with a Letter to the Reader from Frater Taciturnus (Brother Silent). He was upset that the critics had not a done good job on Either/Or so he decided to contact his readers directly. He begins with analogies: He states it was his task to present \\"an unhappy love affair in which love is dialectical in itself and in the crisis of infinite reflection acquires a religious aspect.\\"Stages on Life's Way, Hong pp. 415-416. His task resulted in an editorial from the Danish newspaper The Corsair directed at Frater Taciturnus which brought Kierkegaard into open conflict with Peder Ludvig Møller and Meïr Goldschmidt. The Corsair had reviewed Either/Or March 10, 1843, it had been published on February 20, 1843. On July 4, 1845 the Corsair praised Hilarious Bookbinder for his work on Stages. Victor Eremita was praised for his work on Either/Or once again in November and then in December Moller wrote A Visit in Soro and Frater Taciturnus replied with The Activity of a Traveling Estetician and How He Still Happened to Pay for the Dinner.Howard V. hong and Edna H. Hong published The Corsair Affair in 1982. In that book they have all the materials available if one wants to read it. The newspaper began to caricature Kierkegaard after he wrote to them in reply after reply. Kierkegaard wrote the following in his Journals in relation to this external episode in his life as an author. Criticism Georg Brandes is credited with introducing Soren Kierkegaard to the reading public with his 1879 biography about him, he also wrote an analysis of the works of Henrik Ibsen and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in which he made many comparisons between their works and the works of Kierkegaard. Brandes' translator called Stages on Life's Way, Stages on the Path of Life, in 1899. He considered Stages on Life's Way in relation to Either/Or and the works of Ibsen. This is what Brandes had to say: The Review of Reviews in 1894 discussed Kierkegaard's book in relation to his affair with Regine Olsen like this: Douglas V. Steere translated part of Kierkegaard's Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits and wrote an introduction to David F. Swenson and Lillian Marvin Swenson's translation of Works of Love. He wrote the following in his introduction to Works of Love: John Daniel Wild wrote the following in 1959: Julia Watkin says the bulk of Stages was composed between September 1844 and March 1845. And that Quidam's diary is the conterpart of the seducer's diary.Julia Watkin, Historical Dictionary of Kierkegaard's Philosophy, p. 241. Naomi Lebowitz said, \\"Kierkegaard takes his most cherished model Socrates, who hid his beauty behind the Silenus skin of a \\"hectoring satyr\\". He spends his whole life, says Alcibiades in the Symposium, a favorite dialogue of Kierkegaard, pretending and playing with people, and I doubt whether anyone has ever seen the treasures which are revealed when he grows serious and exposes what he keeps inside. And he would imitate Christ,As was the prototype, so must the imitation also be, even though it is a slow and difficult task to deny oneself, a heavy cross to take up, a heavy cross to bear, and one that, according to the prototype’s instructions, is to be carried in obedience unto death, so that the imitator, even if he does not die on the cross, nevertheless resembles the prototype in dying “with the cross on.” Søren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, 1847 p. 220-221 Hong in whom everything is revealed and everything hidden, so that his words are heard as offense and stumbling blocks.\\"1 Corinthians 1:20-25 The BibleNaomi Lebowitz, Kierkegaard: A Life of Allegory,1985 p. 2-3 Walter Lowrie notes that Kierkegaard wrote a \\"repetition of Either/Or\\" because it stopped with the ethical. \\"He said of it that, like Aladdin's palace, it was left with an unfinished window, this lack he proposed to supply by adding a story entitled Guilty?/Not Guilty? He advised readers to read the Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses as well as Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions \\"to understand how it is that Quidam's Diary leads up to and into the religious stage.\\"A Short Life of Kierkegaard, Lowrie, 1942, 1970 p. 164-165 Paul Sponheim, in his introduction to Lowrie's translation of Stages, compares the book with Fear and Trembling. He agrees that the religious stage is not \\"fully stated in Stages because Quidam cannot understand the paradigm \\"for he fails to speak of the forgiveness of sins, which lies outside his task.Stages on Life's Way, Lowrie 1940, 1967 p. 10. Thom Satterlee, a Danish translator and novelist has Soren Kierkegaard as one of the characters in his 2013 book, The Stages.The Stages by Thom Satterlee In 1988 Mary Elizabeth Moore discusses Kierkegaard's method of indirect communication in this book.

The 13th Division was an infantry division of the United States Army. It was established at Camp Lewis, Washington, in 1918, during World War I. The war ended before the division saw combat, and it was inactivated in 1919. Creation The 13th Division was activated at Camp Lewis, Washington on July 16, 1918 as part of the U.S. military mobilization for World War I. It was manned and trained at Camp Lewis in preparation for combat in France, and formed from a few existing units as the organization's nucleus, while draftees, predominantly from the West Coast of the United States, filled out the majority of the division. The \\"square\\" 13th Division's complement of four regiments included the 1st, 44th, 75th, and 76th Infantry Regiments. In August 1918, the regiments were organized to form two brigades—the 25th (1st and 75th Regiments, plus the 38th Machine Gun Battalion) -- and the 26th Brigade (44th and 76th Regiments, plus the 39th Machine Gun Battalion). =Task organization= * 13th Division Headquarters Troop  25th Infantry Brigade  26th Infantry Brigade  13th Field Artillery Brigade *37th Field Artillery Regiment *38th Field Artillery Regiment *39th Field Artillery Regiment *13th Trench Mortar Battery 213th Engineer Regiment 213th Field Signal Battalion 13th Train Headquarters and Military Police 13th Supply Train 213th Engineer Train 13th Ammunition Train 13th Sanitary Train * 249th Field Hospital and Ambulance Company * 250th Field Hospital and Ambulance Company * 251st Field Hospital and Ambulance Company * 252nd Field Hospital and Ambulance Company Community support Cornelius Vanderbilt III served as the division's interim commander in the summer of 1918. As they had for the recently departed 91st Division, community leaders welcomed Vanderbilt at a formal reception which took place at the newly-constructed Camp Lewis gymnasium, and included an orchestra, and more than 1,000 guests, including Governor Ernest Lister. In addition to the reception for Vanderbilt, the civilian community welcomed the 13th Division's soldiers with public events, including a picnic and a track meet. Horace R. Cayton Sr., the publisher of Cayton's Weekly and Seattle's first African American journalist, criticized Vanderbilt for barring black troops from Camp Lewis's most popular recreation center. He had also segregated the camp's Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) Hostess House, which was widely popular among soldiers. Vanderbilt lifted the bans in September as the result of the public outcry generated by Cayton's articles. Service at Camp Lewis The 13 Division was briefly commanded by Brigadier General Frank B. Watson, with Vanderbilt taking command of the 25th Brigade. When the permanent commander, Major General Joseph D. Leitch arrived in October 1918, Watson assumed command of the 26th Brigade. In late September 1918, the Spanish influenza epidemic reached Camp Lewis, and the post soon averaged 10 deaths per week. In early October, the 213th Engineer Regiment arrived for assignment to the 13th Division, and brought even more ill soldiers into the camp. In an effort to halt the widening epidemic, Leitch imposed a quarantine on October 19. A Tacoma Daily Ledger fundraising campaign to erect the world's largest flagpole at Camp Lewis culminated on October 12, 1918, when soldiers attempted to raise a 60-by-90-foot American flag which was mounted on a 314-foot-tall pole made from a Douglas fir tree. The event was sparsely attended because of the flu quarantine, and soon after the pole went up, a gust of wind whipped the flag hard enough to snap the pole in three places. An attempt to raise a 214-foot pole in November also met with failure, as the wind caught the flag during the dedication ceremony, snapped the pole into two pieces and shredded the flag. A third, more traditional flagpole was successfully erected later in November. The death of Alexander P. Cronkite Major Alexander P. Cronkhite was a company commander in the 213th Engineers and the son of Major General Adelbert Cronkhite. He arrived at Camp Lewis in early October, and was soon hospitalized with influenza. Major Cronkhite was released on October 21, and joined his company for a cross-country hike. Because he was still recovering, another officer was temporarily in command. When the group stopped to rest and eat lunch, Cronkhite used a borrowed handgun to engage in target practice by shooting at a tobacco tin on a nearby fence post. While engaged in this activity, Cronkhite sustained a gunshot wound and died at the scene. Subsequent investigation found that it was accidental and self-inflicted. Adelbert Cronkhite did not accept this finding, and pushed for several years to have the investigation reopened. In the mid-1920s, the sergeant and captain who had been with Alexander Cronkhite when he died were arrested and charged with murder. Because the captain was Jewish, Adelbert Cronkhite's cause was taken up by anti-Semitic newspapers, creating a nationwide story. When the sergeant was tried, defense attorneys were able to demonstrate that an accidental shooting was the most likely possibility. He was acquitted, and charges against the captain were soon dismissed. Post-war The armistice of November 11, 1918 ended World War I before the 13th Division could complete its training and depart for France. Within a few days, Leitch began permitting the release of officers who were no longer needed, as well as soldiers who requested discharge so they could return home to support their families. The 13th Division held a demobilization parade on November 22, 1918, with members of the local community watching primarily from their automobiles as a precaution against the spread of influenza. The division was nearly demobilized by February 1919, except for the 13th Field Artillery Brigade, which was briefly employed in Seattle to help restore order during a labor strike. Demobilization resumed again on February 25, and the soldiers of the 13th Field Artillery Brigade were soon discharged to civilian life. Insignia The 13th Division's shoulder sleeve insignia was approved by the War Department shortly before the division demobilized. It consisted of a blue circle featuring the number 13 in white. A black cat depicted above a red horseshoe open at the top were intended to represent hoodoo that the Germans could not defeat, and the good luck that the division expected to have during combat in France.

The battle was fought in Corinthian territory, at the dry bed of the Nemea River. The battle was a decisive Spartan victory, which, coupled with the Battle of Coronea later in the same year, gave Sparta the advantage in the early fighting on the Greek mainland. Prelude Hostilities in the Corinthian War began in 395 BC with raiding in northwestern Greece, eventually leading to a clash between Sparta and Thebes at the Battle of Haliartus, a Theban victory. In the wake of this battle, Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos joined together to form an anti- Spartan alliance, with its forces commanded by a council at Corinth.Diodorus Siculus, Library 14.82.1-3 In 394 BC, the council gathered together its forces at Corinth. A Spartan army under Aristodemus, the guardian of the boy king Agesipolis, was sent north from Sparta to challenge the allies. The allied army, meanwhile, waited at Corinth, while the council debated over who should command it. Before a decision was reached, the Spartan army entered Corinthian territory, burning and plundering along the way. The allies marched out to meet the Spartans, and the two armies met each other near the dry bed of the Nemea river.Xenophon, Hellenica 4.2.9-15 The battle The Spartan army was composed of some 18,000-19,000 hoplites, with associated light troops. Of the hoplites, 6,000 were Spartan, with the remainder coming from the other states of the Peloponnesian League: 3,000 from the Eleans, Triphylians, Acrorians, and Lasionians; 1,500 from Sicyon; and at least 3,000 from Epidaurus, Troezen, Hermione, and Halieis. There was also a cavalry force of about 600, about 300 Cretan archers, and at least 400 Marganian, Letrinian, and Amphidolian slingers. Opposing the Spartans, the allied side consisted of about 24,000 hoplites, with associated light troops. Thebes, Athens, and Argos each provided about one quarter of the allied hoplites: 6,000 hoplites from Athens, about 7,000 from Argos, 5,000 from the Boeotians, 3,000 from Corinth, and 3,000 from Euboea. Of the allied cavalry, 800 were Boeotian, 600 were Athenian, about 100 from Chalcis in Euboea, and about 50 from the Ozolian Locrians.Xenophon: A History of My Times (Hellenica) 4.2.17 197-198 The Spartans and their allies lined up for battle with the Spartans on the right and the allies on the left. The opposing coalition was divided over how to arrange themselves; the Athenians wanted to line up on the right, but ultimately had acceded to the demand of the Boeotians that they take the left, while the Boeotians took the right. This meant that the Athenians were opposite the Spartans, while the Boeotians and other allies faced the Spartans' allies. As the two phalanxes closed for battle, both shifted to the right (This was a common occurrence in hoplite battles--hoplites carried their shield on their left arm, so men would shift to the right to gain the protection of their neighbor's shield as well as their own.). This shift meant that, by the time the armies met, both of them extended past their opponents' left flank. Consequently, the right flanks of both armies were victorious, while the left flanks of both were defeated. The Spartans then turned from their defeat of the Athenians to face the soldiers from the allied right wing who were returning from their pursuit of the Spartans' allies. The Spartan phalanx took first the Argives, then the Corinthians, and then the Boeotians in the side, inflicting heavy losses on all three. At the end of the day, the Spartans had inflicted 2,800 casualties, while suffering only 1,100.Diodorus Siculus, Library 14.83.1-2Xenophon, Hellenica 4.2.16-23 Aftermath Although the Spartans held the field at the end of the battle, they were unable to force their way past Corinth and enter central Greece. Accordingly, they returned home. The allied army, after several months of inactivity, saw action in a second major battle at Coronea later in the same year. These two battles marked the only traditional large-scale land fighting that would take place in the war, which lasted until 386 BC.Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 549-50 See also *Spartan hegemony References *Fine, John V.A.

Each site includes one to three pit houses, and was discovered in 1993 during an archaeological dig. The remains of twelve humans were found at one of the pit house sites, dating to the 12th century.  Initial dig  The site, designated 5MT10010, dates to between approximately 1150 and 1175 A.D. It is located on the south slopes of Ute Mountain near Towaoc, approximately 15 miles west of Mesa Verde, the famous Anasazi cliff dwellings. Some archeologists believe that the site was settled by immigrants from Chaco Canyon, or the Chuska Mountains.Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). The Archeology of Colorado, Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. pp. 162. . Five of the human skeletons at the site were from burials. The remaining seven exhibited many signs of cannibalism including defleshing, fragmentation of long bones to extract marrow, chopped, cut, and blackened bones. A stone tool kit appropriate for butchering a mid-sized mammal was found.Cummins, Joseph. (2001) Cannibals. Globe Pequot The initial excavation was supervised by University of North Carolina archaeologist Brian Billman, employed by a private firm contracted by the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe. The land on which the site was located is within the Ute Mountain Indian Reservation and was owned by a local Ute religious leader, who supervised the dig and reburied the bones once the examination was complete. What is particularly interesting about the Cowboy Wash site is that it appears to have been abandoned very quickly. Generally, the ancient peoples would have taken all salvageable materials with them, yet the excavators found everything had been left behind. Analysis of coprolite The initial reports speculating that the seven humans had been cannibalized was met with skepticism from some scientists and criticism by Native American groups including the Ute tribe. (The Ute are a separate people from either the alleged victims or the alleged perpetrators.) The Ute have a strong oral tradition of peace between their ancestors and neighboring groups, which is not necessarily in agreement with the traditions of other groups or historical information. To investigate the theory that cannibalism had been practiced at the Cowboy Wash site, Richard Marlar, a University of Colorado molecular biologist examined the coprolite (fossilized human feces) found on site and discovered it tested positive for human myoglobin, which is found in human muscle tissue. This type of myoglobin was not found in 20 'control' coprolites in comparable sites.\\"Most compelling evidence of cannibalism yet\\", ABC Science http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2000/09/08/173228.htm This indicated the feces contained the remains of digested human flesh. Malar also found the myoglobin protein during a chemical analysis of a cooking pot at the ancient Anasazi site.  Explanation  There are conflicting theories about whether or not cannibalism occurred at Cowboy Wash. According to Billman, the current explanation for the apparent cannibalism was that drought struck the region, prompting groups to move and seek food. This led to territorial conflicts between groups and a decline in social order. The remains were dated to be around the time consistent with the demise of the Chaco system. Some researchers have found reference to warfare-related cannibalism within Puebloan culture, for example, that among the Hopi, \\"chewing on shreds of enemy scalps was thought to make children brave hearted\\".Malotki, E. and K. Gary. (1999)Hopisosont-\\"Human Cravers\\": Echos of Anthropophagy in Hopi Oral Traditions. European Review of Native American Studies. Vol 13 Issue 1 p.9-13 However, others speculate that the coprolite found at Cowboy Wash contains remains of Ancient Pueblo people who were killed and consumed by a cultural outsider.Fry, Douglas P. (2007). Beyond War: The Human Potential for Peace. Oxford University Press US. Other theories include the bones reflect evidence of reburial rituals or perhaps ritual killing of those suspected of witchcraft. It has even been suggested that Billman's team mistook a coyote coprolite for human. Bower, B. (9 Sept. 2000). Ancient Site Holds Cannibalism Clues.

Roman Nose (c. 1823 – September 17, 1868), also known as Hook Nose (Cheyenne: Vóhko'xénéhe,Cheyenne Dictionary, 2004–2007 also spelled Woqini and Woquini), was a Native American of the Northern Cheyenne. He is considered to be one of, if not the greatest and most influential warriors during the Plains Indian War of the 1860s. Born during the prosperous days of the fur trade in the 1820s, he was called môséškanetsénoonáhe (Bat) as a youth. He later took the warrior name Wokini, which the whites rendered as Roman Nose. Considered invincible in combat, this fierce warrior distinguished himself in battle to such a degree that the U.S. military mistook him for the Chief of the entire Cheyenne nation. Biography Hook Nose was born around 1830 and was a Northern Suhtai, a band within the Northern Cheyenne tribe. A common mistake is to confuse him with a supposed son of the Minniconjou Lakota Sioux Lone Horn and brother of Spotted Elk and Touch the Clouds called Roman Nose. Following the Sand Creek Massacre in November 1864, Hook Nose became a principal figure among his people, leading retaliatory strikes against Euro-American settlements at the Battle of Julesburg along the Platte Road and Powder River regions of south-central Wyoming and in the Platte valley of Nebraska, western Kansas, and eastern Colorado. The Native American author and physician Charles A. Eastman allegedly wrote of Hook Nose that, \\"Perhaps no other warrior attacked more emigrants along the Oregon Trail between 1860–1868.\\"Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa), Indian Heroes and Great Chieftains, Mineola, Dover Publications, 1997, p. 86, . Contrary to popular myth, Hook Nose was never a chief, nor a leader of any of the six Cheyenne military societies. However, known to all plains Indians as a great warrior, and the acknowledged leader during combat, Hook Nose's reputation spread among the whites who credited him with initiating most hostilities between the Cheyenne and U.S military. A member of the Crooked Lance Warrior Society, Hook Nose continually refused seats among the Cheyenne Chiefs and headsmen, and never held a position of authority within his tribe. Physically imposing in stature, there are several historical references to Hook Nose's flamboyant, intimidating personality and battle prowess. Isaac Coates, General Winfield S. Hancock's surgeon, observed a verbal confrontation between Hancock and Hook Nose outside Fort Larned in April 1867. Coates wrote in his journal; \\"of all the chiefs, he is one of the finest specimens, physically, of his race. He is quite six feet in height, finely formed with a large body and muscular limbs. His appearance, decidedly military, and on this occasion, particularly so, since he wore the uniform of a General in the Army. A seven-shooting Spencer carbine hung at the side of his saddle, four large Navy revolvers stuck in his belt, and a bow, already strung with arrows, were grasped in his left hand. Thus armed and mounted on a fine horse, he was a good representative of the God of War; and his manner showed plainly that he did not care whether we talked or fought...\\"Isaac Taylor Coates, On the Plains with Custer and Hancock: The Journal of Isaac Coates, Army Surgeon (edited by W. J. D. Kennedy), Boulder, Johnson Books, 1997, p. 64. Hook Nose opposed treaties with the United States Federal Government, while other leaders urged peace. Following the implementation of the Little Arkansas Treaty in 1865, Hook Nose moved south, pledging to assist his friends, Bull Bear, Grey Beard, and the Cheyenne Dog Soldiers, defend their ancestral hunting grounds along the Smoky Hill River and within the Republican Valley. He was killed by American soldiers during the Battle of Beecher Island on September 17, 1868, while attempting to charge the island in the Arikaree River, and annihilate General Forsyth's command. He was mostly known as \\"Roman Nose\\" among the Americans. Some of his other aliases were Arched Nose, and Woo-kay-nay. Hook Nose was known by his peers as being dedicated and willing to protect his people. Hook Nose was known as a warrior with many skillful and bold tactics to fight against his enemies. Hook Nose was also known to be a very spiritual individual and practiced traditional Cheyenne medicine. Hook Nose and his peers believed it was this medicine that protected him and made him such a great warrior. He died during the Battle at Beecher Island in 1868. \\"He had refused a chieftaincy when young, on the grounds that he spent the major portion of his time in battle rather than in council\\". Although Hook Nose never accepted the role of chief, many of his peers respected him as a leader and protector of his people and their resources. \\"Roman Nose, was a leader of Indian warriors and a member of the crooked Lance Society of the Cheyenne Indian Tribe\\". Hook Nose's intentions might have been to protect his people; however, non-Indians perceived him a malicious man. \\"Roman Nose, the fierce Dog Soldier Warrior, was considered a 'bad' Indian. He wanted the white man evicted from the plains. His lance meant to sweep the lands clean of whites fences, houses, cattle and the 'iron horse'\\". Hook Nose's leadership, battle tactics, and spirituality are a few things that made him known to many. Although he died fairly young, Hook Nose left an impact on the west during his time. Battle tactics and leadership skills Hook Nose's battle tactics and leadership skills were not only known by his tribe, but also by other people who encountered him. \\"His bravery came naturally and spotless; his influence was enormous as he was the acknowledged leader in war...though he was not a chief\\". Witnesses of Hook Nose's warfare talked highly about his tactics and leadership abilities. \\"A common battle tactic of his was to ride up and down the line of army troops within rifle range, getting them to discharge their weapons and waste their ammunition.\\" Hook Nose used deadly and malicious tactics to protect himself, his people, and his culture. \\"Roman Nose was a prominent Southern Cheyenne warrior best remembered for his key role in the ongoing battle against white advancement in the west throughout the 1860s\\". Hook Nose did not accept the idea that the west was expanding and being industrialized. Giving in to the enemy did not seem to be an option for him. Spiritual practices Hook Nose was known to be very spiritual. \\"He spent endless hours in preparing his medicine, his mind and his spirit\\". It is believed the reason he would show up late to most battles was due, in part, in that he spent a longer amount of time than usual in prayer for blessings and to prepare for warfare. It is known that Hook Nose would spend days on quests to cleanse his spirit and gain strength through his medicine. Not only was Hook Nose protected by his medicine he gained through ceremony, but he also felt that he was protected by his famous War-bonnet that was made and given to him by White Bull. It was also believed that it was because of his war-bonnet and the medicine he practiced to be the reason why he was such a successful warrior.  Death and believed causes  It was believed that through Hook Nose's spiritual practices and his war-bonnet, he and others surrounding him were protected. In order for his war-bonnet to protect him, there were certain rules and rituals he had to obey. Some of these rules included never shaking hands with anyone, and never eating food that had been prepared or served using metal. Hook Nose had complete faith in his war-bonnet, and believed that it had always protected him in battle. Hook Nose and his fellow warriors believed that, on the morning of the Battle of Beecher's Island, Hook Nose's medicine had been tampered with. Hook Nose had felt that something was wrong and said, \\"Something was done that I was told must not be done, the bread I ate was taken out of the frying pan with something made of iron... If I go into this fight I shall certainly be killed\\". The war bonnet Roman Nose being shot (from an 1895 book). Hook Nose possessed an elaborate warbonnet that he believed gave him special powers. The medicine man Ice, later known as White Bull, made the warbonnet, and assured Hook Nose he would be impervious to the white man's bullets as long as he followed certain conditions. Hook Nose could not shake hands in the way of the white man, nor could he eat food that had been touched with any iron implement. Ice told Hook Nose that should he violate either of these conditions, he would surely be killed in battle. Several days prior to the Battle of Beecher Island, Hook Nose visited the nearby Sioux camp, where he participated in a feast. During the feast, he ate some fry bread. However, the woman who cooked the bread had used an iron fork to remove it from the cooking pan, which violated one of the conditions of his medicine. As he left for battle, he was made aware of this fact, but he did not have the time to perform the necessary cleansing ceremony to restore his medicine. Because of this, he did not participate in the fighting as he normally would, preferring to watch the battle from afar. During the battle, he was chastised by an elderly warrior named White Contrary for his lack of participation, and thus decided to enter the battle after all, knowing that he would die. After donning his war clothes, including his war bonnet, he led an assault on the island. He was shot at close range during the attack and died late that afternoon, near sunset. The demise of Hook Nose had devastating effects on the Cheyenne's efforts to defend their lands, which virtually ended with the defeat of Tall Bull and the Dog Soldiers, at the Battle of Summit Springs, near Sterling, Colorado, in July 1869.

In front of it usually stands the haiden, or oratory. The haiden is often connected to the honden by a heiden, or hall of offerings.Heiden, Encyclopedia of Shinto, accessed don November 17, 2009 Physically, the honden is the heart of the shrine complex, connected to the rest of the shrine but usually raised above it, and protected from public access by a fence called tamagaki. It usually is relatively small and with a gabled roof. Its doors are usually kept closed, except at religious festivals. Shinto priests themselves enter only to perform rituals. The rite of opening those doors is itself an important part of the shrine's life.Mori Mizue Inside the honden is kept the , literally, \\"the sacred body of the kami\\". The go- shintai is actually not divine, but just a temporary repository of the enshrined kami.Smyers (1999:44) Important as it is, the honden may sometimes be completely absent, as for example when the shrine stands on a sacred mountain to which it is dedicated, or when there are nearby himorogi (enclosure) or other yorishiro (substitute object) that serve as a more direct bond to a kami. Ōmiwa Shrine in Nara, for example, contains no sacred images or objects because it is believed to serve the mountain on which it stands (Mount Miwa).See Ōmiwa Shrine siteTamura, page 21 For the same reason, it has a , but no honden. In this sense, it is a model of what the first Shinto shrines were like. Another important shrine without a honden is Suwa Taisha, head of the Suwa shrine network. The honden's structure determines the shrine's architectural style. Many exist, but three (taisha-zukuri, shinmei- zukuri and sumiyoshi-zukuri) are of particular importance because they are the only ones believed to predate the arrival of Buddhism, and have therefore a special architectural and historical significance. They are exemplified respectively by the honden at Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha. German architect Bruno Taut compared the importance of Ise Shrine's honden to that of Greece's Parthenon. For details, see the article Shinto architecture.

The name of this group was derived from the word iraya, which means \\"upstream\\". Karay-a people speak the Karay-a language, also known as Kinaray-a. The term Hamtikanon, is incorrectly substituted to generally refer to all ethnic Karay-a; however, it pertains to the Karay-a people living in Antique and deals more with location of residence than ethnicity. They are part of the wider Visayan ethnolinguistic group, who constitute the largest Filipino ethnolinguistic group.

They were first believed to be the descendants of immigrants from Borneo, through the epic-myth of the \\"Ten Bornean Datus\\". Recent findings, however, revealed that the ancestors of the Karay-a are the Austronesian-speaking immigrants who came from South China during the Iron Age. They primarily speak Karay-a. Meanwhile, Hiligaynon, Tagalog, and English are used as second languages. Most are Christians. About 80% are Roman Catholics, and the rest are Protestants. Some people belonging to the Suludnon tribe, are animists. As of 2015, there are about 1,300,000 Karay-a speakers all over the country. About 45% from Antique province, 38% from Iloilo and 7% in Mindanao specifically Sultan Kudarat and North Cotabato. Culture Most Karay-a engage in agriculture, as well as in cottage industries. Several towns in Antique have the distinction of producing quality ware ranging from salakot and sawali from Belison, bamboo-craft from San Jose, ceramics from Sibalom, pottery from Bandoja, Tibiao; mats from Pandan and Libertad; and loom-woven patadyong (barrel skirt) from Bagtason, Bugasong, the only one of its kind in the Visayas and well known throughout Panay. Music, such as courtship songs, wedding hymns, and funeral recitals, is well-developed, as it is with dance.

In public international law the doctrine essentially serves an \\"escape clause\\" to the general rule of pacta sunt servanda (promises must be kept). Because the doctrine is a risk to the security of treaties, as its scope is relatively unconfined, the conditions in which it may be invoked must be carefully noted.Peter Malanczuk, Akehurst's Modern Introduction to International Law, 7th rev. edn (London: Routledge, 1997), p. 144. Function in international law The doctrine is part of customary international law but is also provided for in the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, under Article 62 (Fundamental Change of Circumstance). Although the doctrine is not mentioned by name, Article 62 provides the only justifications for its invocation: the circumstances that existed at the time of the conclusion of the treaty were indeed objectively essential to the obligations of treaty (sub-paragraph A), and the instance for the change of circumstances has had a radical effect on the obligations of the treaty (sub-paragraph B). If the parties to a treaty had contemplated for the occurrence of the changed circumstances, the doctrine does not apply and the provision remains in effect. Clausula rebus sic stantibus relates to changed circumstances only if they had never been contemplated by the parties. That principle is clarified in the Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (United Kingdom v. Iceland, 1973). Although it is clear that a fundamental change of circumstances might justify terminating or modifying a treaty, the unilateral denunciation of a treaty is prohibited. A party does not have the right to denounce a treaty unilaterally. (However, that has been debated.)  Function in private law  The principle of clausula rebus sic stantibus exists in all legal systems which descend from Roman law. In Swiss law, article 119 of the Swiss Code of Obligations is not the source of the principle's applicability in Swiss contract law. History A key figure in the formulation of clausula rebus sic stantibus was the Italian jurist Scipione Gentili (1563–1616), who is generally credited for coining the maxim omnis conventio intelligitur rebus sic stantibus ('every convention is understood with circumstances as they stand').: p. 13, citing De iure belli libri tres, lib. 111, cap. XIV. The Swiss legal expert Emer de Vattel (1714–1767) was the next key contributor. Vattel promoted the view that 'every body bound himself for the future only on the stipulation of the presence of the actual conditions' and so 'with a change of the condition also the relations originating from the situation would undergo a change'. During the 19th century, civil law came to reject the doctrine of clausula rebus sic standibus, but Vattel's thinking continued to influence international law, not least because it helped reconcile 'the antagonism between the static nature of the law and the dynamism of international life'. While individual cases invoking the doctrine were much disputed, the doctrine itself was little questioned. Its provision in the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties established the doctrine firmly but not without dispute as 'a norm of international law'.  Examples  * According to Polybius, in 211 BC, Lyciscus of Acarnania argued that the Lacedaemonians should abandon their treaty with the Aetolian League because of fundamentally changed circumstances. This is perhaps the earliest recorded example of the principle of rebus sic stantibus at work. * Elizabeth I of England sought to amend the 1585 Treaty of Nonsuch on the grounds of fundamentally changed circumstances, but her efforts have not been well regarded by modern jurists. * In a 'classic' case for the doctrine, Russia attempted to change the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1856) on military shipping in the Black Sea. Russia achieved this in connection with the Treaty of London (1871), partly by invoking clausula rebus sic stantibus. One important outcome was the insistence by other parties that unilateral termination of a treaty was not legal on those grounds. * Article 59 of the Treaty of Berlin (1878) made Batumi a free port. In 1886, Russia terminated the arrangement, partly on the grounds of a fundamental change in circumstances. * In 1881, the United States attempted to end the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty with the United Kingdom. Various arguments were advanced, including clausula rebus sic stantibus. Although that principle ultimately did not apply in the resolution of the case, it is noteworthy as the first time that the US invoked the principle, as it had previously been opposed to it. The US went on to cite the doctrine again in its arguments for the revision of the Treaty of London (1915). * During the 1908 Bosnian crisis, Austria-Hungary renounced its rights and obligations under Article 25 of the Treaty of Berlin (1878). Austria-Hungary's arguments have been seen as an invocation of fundamentally changed circumstances. Moreover, despite protests at its actions, Austria-Hungary succeeded, arguably setting a precedent for the use of the doctrine. * On 7 February 1923, the Permanent Court of International Justice issued an advisory opinion on a case between France and the United Kingdom on the application to British nationals of French nationality decrees issued by the capitulatory regimes in Tunis and Morocco. France cited a fundamental change of circumstances, and the case seems to be the first example of a state invoking rebus sic stantibus before an international court. However, the states settled before the court was required to issue a verdict. * In 1924, Norway dissolved its 1907 treaty with Sweden that had arisen from the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden, citing changed circumstances including the Russian Revolution, the Treaty of Versailles and Norway's entry into the League of Nations. Since the 1907 treaty was also time-limited, the case has been seen as a precedent for rebus sic stantibus applying not only to indefinite treaties. * In 1926, China came to terms with Belgium after its efforts to denounce the Sino-Belgian Pact (1865), citing fundamentally changed circumstances. * In November 1923, France moved its customs office to Gex, Ain, provoking the 'Freezones Controversy' with Switzerland. The matter was brought before the Permanent Court of International Justice, and France invoked rebus sic stantibus, but Switzerland argued that the doctrine did not apply in respect of territorial rights. In 1932, the court found in favour of Switzerland on the basis of fact, but it did not reject that rebus sic stantibus might be a valid basis for France's argument.Case of the Free Zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex , Permanent Court of International Justice, Parties: France & Switzerland, August 19th, 1929, Initiated March 29th, 1928. It was the second time rebus sic stantibus had been argued before an international court.

It builds on a preceding step, called placement, which determines the location of each active element of an IC or component on a PCB. After placement, the routing step adds wires needed to properly connect the placed components while obeying all design rules for the IC. Together, the placement and routing steps of IC design are known as place and route. The task of all routers is the same. They are given some pre-existing polygons consisting of pins (also called terminals) on cells, and optionally some pre-existing wiring called preroutes. Each of these polygons are associated with a net, usually by name or number. The primary task of the router is to create geometries such that all terminals assigned to the same net are connected, no terminals assigned to different nets are connected, and all design rules are obeyed. A router can fail by not connecting terminals that should be connected (an open), by mistakenly connecting two terminals that should not be connected (a short), or by creating a design rule violation. In addition, to correctly connect the nets, routers may also be expected to make sure the design meets timing, has no crosstalk problems, meets any metal density requirements, does not suffer from antenna effects, and so on. This long list of often conflicting objectives is what makes routing extremely difficult. Almost every problem associated with routing is known to be intractable. The simplest routing problem, called the Steiner tree problem, of finding the shortest route for one net in one layer with no obstacles and no design rules is NP-hard if all angles are allowed and NP-complete if only horizontal and vertical wires are allowed. Variants of channel routing have also been shown to be NP-complete, as well as routing which reduces crosstalk, number of vias, and so on. Routers therefore seldom attempt to find an optimum result. Instead, almost all routing is based on heuristics which try to find a solution that is good enough. Design rules sometimes vary considerably from layer to layer. For example, the allowed width and spacing on the lower layers may be four or more times smaller than the allowed widths and spacings on the upper layers. This introduces many additional complications not faced by routers for other applications such as printed circuit board or multi-chip module design. Particular difficulties ensue if the rules are not simple multiples of each other, and when vias must traverse between layers with different rules.  Types of routers  A PCB as a design on a computer (left) and realized as a board assembly populated with components (right). The board is double sided, with through-hole plating, green solder resist and a white legend. Both surface mount and through-hole components have been used. The earliest types of EDA routers were \\"manual routers\\"—the drafter clicked a mouse on the endpoint of each line segment of each net. Modern PCB design software typically provides \\"interactive routers\\"—the drafter selects a pad and clicks a few places to give the EDA tool an idea of where to go, and the EDA tool tries to place wires as close to that path as possible without violating design rule checking (DRC). Some more advanced interactive routers have \\"push and shove\\" (aka \\"shove-aside\\" or \\"automoving\\") features in an interactive router; the EDA tool pushes other nets out of the way, if possible, in order to place a new wire where the drafter wants it and still avoid violating DRC. Modern PCB design software also typically provides \\"autorouters\\" that route all remaining unrouted connections without human intervention. The main types of autorouters are: * Maze router  Lee router  Hadlock router  Flood router * Line-probe router  Mikami–Tahuchi router  Hightower router * Pattern router * Channel router  Switchbox router  River router  Spine and stitch router * Gridless router  Area router  Graph theory-based router * Bloodhound router (CADSTAR by Racal-Redac / Zuken) * Specctra (aka Allegro PCB Router) (gridless since version 10)  Topological router * FreeStyle Router (aka SpeedWay, a DOS-based autorouter for P-CAD) * TopoR (a Windows-based autorouter, also used in Eremex's Delta Design) * Toporouter (Anthony Blake's open-source router in PCB of the gEDA suite) * TopRouter (the topological pre-router in CadSoft/Autodesk's EAGLE 7.0 and higher) * SimplifyPCB (a topological router with a focus on bundle routing with hand- routing results)  How routers work  Many routers execute the following overall algorithm: * First, determine an approximate course for each net, often by routing on a coarse grid. This step is called global routing, and may optionally include layer assignment. Global routing limits the size and complexity of the following detailed routing steps, which can be done grid square by grid square. For detailed routing, the most common technique is rip- up and reroute aka rip-up and retry: *Select a sequence in which the nets are to be routed. *Route each net in sequence *If not all nets can be successfully routed, apply any of a variety of \\"cleanup\\" methods, in which selected routings are removed, the order of the remaining nets to be routed is changed, and the remaining routings are attempted again. This process repeats until all nets are routed or the program (or user) gives up. An alternative approach is to treat shorts, design rule violations, obstructions, etc. on a similar footing as excess wire length—that is, as finite costs to be reduced (at first) rather than as absolutes to be avoided. This multi-pass \\"iterative- improvement\\" routing method is described by the following algorithm: * For each of several iterative passes: * Prescribe or adjust the weight parameters of an \\"objective function\\" (having a weight parameter value for each unit of excess wire length, and for each type of violation). E.g., for the first pass, excess wire length may typically be given a high cost, while design violations such as shorts, adjacency, etc. are given a low cost. In later passes, the relative ordering of costs is changed so that violations are high-cost, or may be prohibited absolutely. * Select (or randomly choose) a sequence in which nets are to be routed during this pass. * \\"Rip up\\" (if previously routed) and reroute each net in turn, so as to minimize the value of the objective function for that net. (Some of the routings will in general have shorts or other design violations.) * Proceed to the next iterative pass until routing is complete and correct, is not further improved, or some other termination criterion is satisfied. Most routers assign wiring layers to carry predominantly \\"x\\" or \\"y\\" directional wiring, though there have been routers which avoid or reduce the need for such assignment. There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. Restricted directions make power supply design and the control of inter-layer crosstalk easier, but allowing arbitrary routes can reduce the need for vias and decrease the number of required wiring layers.

Early life Saxon was born Charles David Isaacson in Brooklyn; both his parents were musicians, and his great-uncle had been court violinist to the British Queen Victoria. Career and education He played drums and worked in jazz bands while at Columbia University, which he entered at 15; he became editor of its humor magazine, Jester. After earning his B.A. he worked at Dell Publishing as editor of the satire magazine Ballyhoo before serving as a bomber pilot in the Army Air Corps during World War II, flying 40 missions over Germany.Murphy, p. 103. After the war he rejoined Dell, left to edit This Week for a year, and returned to edit Modern Screen. He also began drawing cartoons on weekends, selling them to The Saturday Evening Post. His first appearance in The New Yorker was a spot illustration in 1943; after becoming a full-time cartoonist in 1955, he joined their staff in 1956 and over more than 30 years drew 92 covers and more than 700 cartoons for the magazine. Much of his New Yorker work gently pokes fun at the privileged denizens of prosperous suburbs; unusually, he wrote his own words, often highlighting clichés, as in an image of well-fed executives in a boardroom, the chairman stating \\"Of course, honesty is one of the better policies.\\"Murphy, pp. 186–87. After The New Yorker was taken over and William Shawn left the editorship, his work was rarely published there.Murphy, pp. 188–89. He published three collections of his cartoons for the magazine: Oh, Happy, Happy, Happy! (1960), One Man's Fancy (1970), and Honesty Is One of the \\"Better\\" Policies: Saxon's World of Business (1984). Saxon also drew numerous ads, including for Chivas Regal, American Airlines, Bankers Trust, I.B.M., and Xerox. As his obituary in The New York Times noted, \\"So ubiquitous was his advertising work in the late 1970s that one edition of The Wall Street Journal featured ads by Mr. Saxon for three different companies.\\" Saxon had one-man shows at the Nicholls Gallery. He was awarded a gold medal by the Art Directors Club of New York in 1963 and an honorary doctorate by Hamilton College in 1972. He received the National Cartoonist Society Advertising Award for 1977, and their Gag Cartoon Award for 1980, 1986, and 1987. For his work with The New Yorker, he received their Reuben Award for 1980. Personal life He was married to Nancy Lee Saxon, née Rogers, a sculptor and portraitist, and illustrated her children's books; they had three children. Death Saxon died of heart failure on December 6, 1988, at St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford, Connecticut. He spoke his last words to paramedics after suffering a heart attack at home: \\"I guess I'd better die; I just broke our best lamp.\\"Murphy, p. 189.

He was educated at Queen's University, Belfast, the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium and the University of Michigan, where he lectured in political philosophy for two years from 1952. He worked for the Birmingham Post from 1953, where he was noticed by Godfrey Winn, who became a significant influence upon him as well as, later, Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere. The film critic of the London Evening Standard from 1960, he remained in the role until his death in 2003. His most extended work being a book trilogy on the history of the British film industry: Hollywood England, National Heroes and Icons in the Fire. In addition, he was the author of an Elizabeth Taylor biography, a history of the impact made on Hollywood by the rise of the talkies (The Shattered Silents) and a study of the work of Stanley Kubrick. = Ken Russell = Walker had a close relationship with Kubrick but was a fierce critic of the British director Ken Russell, referring to the director's visceral The Devils (1971) as being \\"a garish glossary of sado-masochism … a taste for visual sensation that makes scene after scene look like the masturbatory fantasies of a Roman Catholic boyhood.\\" Having previously been a defender of Russell's early work for the BBC he was increasingly critical of Russell films of the 1970s, reviewing The Music Lovers (1970) he wrote: \\"This man must be stopped: bring me an elephant gun.\\" In a television showdown between the two men in response to Walker's assessment of The Devils as \\"monstrously indecent\\", Russell reached over and hit him around the head with a rolled up newspaper copy of his own review. In later life, when asked about the incident and if he regretted it, Russell responded that he did regret it, \\"I wish it had been an iron bar.\\" Walker assembled a collection of more than 200 drawings and prints by modern artists, which were bequeathed to the British Museum after his death in 2003.

Bisaya, on the other hand, is a combination of Cebuano and other Visayan ethnolinguistic groups, shown in royal blue. The Cebuano people () are the largest subgroup of the larger ethnolingustic group Bisaya, who constitute the largest Filipino ethnolinguistic group in the country. Their primary language is the Cebuano language, an Austronesian language. They originated in the province of Cebu in the region of Central Visayas, but then later spread out to other places in the Philippines, such as Siquijor, Bohol, Negros Oriental, southwestern Leyte, western Samar, Masbate, and large parts of Mindanao. It may also refer to the ethnic group who speak the same language as their native tongue in different parts of the archipelago. History A Visayan freemen (or timawa) couple, depicted in the Boxer Codex (). American period. The earliest European record of Cebuanos was by Antonio Pigafetta of the Magellan expedition. He provided some descriptions of their customs as well as samples of the Cebuano language. Ferdinand Magellan was killed in Cebu during the Battle of Mactan against the forces of Lapu-Lapu. Later early Spanish colonists referred to the Cebuanos (and other Visayans) as the pintados (\\"the painted ones\\"), due to their widespread practice of tattooing to record battle exploits. Culture and festivities The majority of Cebuanos are Roman Catholic, with many in rural areas synchronizing Catholicism with indigenous Anitism, maintaining beliefs and rituals around saints as avatars for older diwata. A minority of Cebuanos (specifically those in Mindanao) are Muslim, or in mixed Chinese- Cebuano families, incorporate Catholic beliefs with aspects of Buddhism or Taoism. Among the island's notable festivities are the Sinulog festival, which is a mixture of Christian and native cultural elements, celebrated annually every third week of January.

It is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It is one of Pitt’s six schools of the health sciences and one of several dental schools in Pennsylvania. It is closely affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The School of Dental Medicine accepted 3.6% of applicants for the class of 2016, a record low for the school's entire history. It is located in Salk Hall on Pitt’s campus. Each year, between 70 and 80 students graduate from Pitt’s D.M.D. program. Admission into the School of Dental Medicine is highly competitive. Eighty incoming students were accepted out of 2,200 applications submitted. Total mean college GPA of incoming students in 2017 was 3.74 (science 3.67); academic average DAT score was 21.6. Dr. Bernard J. Costello is the School of Dental Medicine’s current dean as of 2018. History Founded as the Pittsburgh Dental College, the school was organized and chartered simultaneously with its establishment as a department of dentistry at the Western University of Pennsylvania, the former name of the University of Pittsburgh. The School of Dental Medicine welcomed its first class of 119 freshmen that September. The school grew quickly and moved into increasingly larger facilities. Under the leadership of Dean H. Edmund Friesell, the Dental College was renamed the School of Dentistry when it became an integral part of the university when the university assumed charge of the Dental Department and property following the implementation of an agreement on October 5, 1905. By the 1920s, the dental school was reported to be, for at least a time, the largest in the world. The School of Dental Medicine has occupied its current space in Salk Hall, which was converted from a former municipal hospital facility to house Pitt’s dental and pharmacy schools, since 1967. Noteworthy events in School of Dental Medicine history: * The Pittsburgh Dental College admitted its first female student, Ms. Mary L. Glenn, in 1898. In 2008-09, 34 percent of the students in the School of Dental Medicine’s entering freshman class were women. * The School of Dentistry awarded its first master's degree in dentistry to Nora E. Murry in 1935. The School of Dental Medicine now awards advanced degrees in 10 different disciplines. * In 1963, the school graduated its first class of dental assistants. Pitt’s dental hygiene program is the only such program in the state of Pennsylvania that is part of a major university and accredited dental school and affiliated with a medical center. * In 1965, five of the dental school’s chairs were dedicated to the treatment of children with disabilities. Today, the School of Dental Medicine bears the reputation of leadership and innovation in treatment of patients with special needs. * The Doctor of Dental Medicine (D.M.D.) degree replaced the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree in 1967 and the school was renamed the School of Dental Medicine to reflect the profession’s evolution.

It is equipped with six dedicated, multi-specialty treatment rooms including two private treatment areas equipped for general anesthesia, a designated recovery area for sedation and general anesthesia patients, and a dedicated waiting and reception area. * _Multidisciplinary Implant Center_ : Because they look and feel more like natural teeth, implants offer a superior alternative for tooth replacement, and the MIC offers a high-quality facility and a collaborative environment for providing this increasingly common treatment. Housed in of space, the MIC features nine operatories, including two full surgical suites. * _Emergency Clinic_ : The School of Dental Medicine is equipped to handle dental emergencies for patients who do not have access to such care elsewhere. Dental emergencies may include acute pain, swelling, or bleeding, for example. * _Cone-beam computed topography unit_ : The CBCT unit uses a cone-shaped X-ray rather than a linear one to create three-dimensional images that have many applications in dental medicine. CBCT imaging can be helpful in planning implants, orthognathic surgery, and evaluating pathology, among other dental procedures. Dentists practicing in the Pittsburgh region may schedule patients for CBCT scans as an additional resource in their course of treatment. Other The School of Dental Medicine’s Dental Museum features a host of dental artifacts used by early 20th century practitioners. It also includes works of fine art by alumnus Dr. Frederick Franck (DDS ’42) and Mr. Virgil Cantini. The Dental Museum is open to the public from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday–Friday. Publications The School of Dental Medicine publishes Pitt Dental Magazine biannually to inform the school’s alumni and friends about its activities and initiatives. It also distributes an electronic alumni newsletter a number of times throughout the year and a monthly e-newsletter to faculty, staff, and students at the school. The school also publishes a Facts and Figures brochure, which is updated annually.

Set in the lobby, restaurants, and bar of an up-scale Paris hotel (probably the Hôtel Ritz), the play follows the lives of a variety of socialites over a three-year period from 1924 to 1926. It is remarkable among its contemporaries due to its prominent treatment of sexuality, including homosexuality. This, however, is but the facade of Coward's exploration of the disconnected monotony of the lives of the elite. The play, directed by Philip Prowse, was first produced in 1977 by the Glasgow Citizen's Theatre. The English premiere was produced by the Crescent Theatre, Birmingham, in 1979. It has been produced only once since, in 2001 by Thelma Holt, Karl Sydow and Bill Kenwright at the Lyric Theatre, London, also directed by Prowse.Wolf, Matt. \\"Semi-Monde\\", Variety, 25 March 2001, accessed 12 August 2020 No further professional performances are known of; the only other production recorded was a production by Arts Canterbury in Ottawa in 2006. In addition, it was also produced as a public performance at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, London in the autumn of 2004 and the Central School of Speech and Drama, London, between 28 February and 3 March 2007. Significance Noël Coward, it is assumed, knew that Semi-Monde could not be produced in the environment of censorship that existed in the 1920s. However, in private correspondence, Coward described it as \\"jagged with sophistication\\", and sought to have it produced in Germany. It has been put forward that Semi-Monde is Coward's personal exploration of the high society of which he was a member.

The district includes the northern part of Marion, Iowa, an area in Cedar Rapids, part of Robins and rural areas in the county. As of 2019, more than 7700 students were enrolled in district schools. History The Linn-Mar Community School District was formed in 1948 when 17 sub-districts (including twelve one-room school buildings and a two-room school building) were joined together to build the Marion Rural Independent School District. At that time, 678 students were enrolled in grades K-8. Schools The district operates ten schools: *Linn-Mar High School, Marion (est. 1959) *Excelsior Middle School, Marion (est. 1995) *Oak Ridge Middle School, Marion (est. 2003) *Bowman Woods Elementary School, Cedar Rapids (est. 1968) *Echo Hill Elementary School, Marion (est. 2008) *Indian Creek Elementary School, Marion (est. 1961) *Linn Grove Elementary School, Marion (est. 2007) *Novak Elementary School, Marion (est. 2010) *Westfield Elementary School, Robins (est. 1999) *Wilkins Elementary School, Marion (est. 1966)  Referendums  * March, 1993, district residents approved an $8.5 million bond issue to construct a new 5-6 intermediate building, fund media center expansions, construct 14 additional High School classrooms, and create additions to four elementary buildings: Bowman Woods, Indian Creek, Wilkins and Novak (current LRC building). * February, 1997 a $25 million bond proposal was voter approved. This bond helped fund the 1999 District change from a K-4, 5-6, 7-8, and 9-12 configuration to a K-5, 6-8, and 9-12 configuration. Westfield elementary was constructed and additions were made to Wilkins and Indian Creek. Excelsior was expanded to become a 6-8 building and the High School underwent a remodeled to make it a more efficient 9-12 building. * A $12 million bond proposal allowed for the construction of Oak Ridge (originally constructed as a K-8 building) and the Bowman Woods Gymnasium. This bond proposal was approved in 2001. * January 2006 voters approved a $27.5 million bond referendum by nearly 75% approval. The District constructed two new elementary schools (Linn Grove and Echo Hill), converted Oak Ridge to a 6-8 building and made renovations to the High School and Novak Elementary (current LRC building). * September of 2018 voters approved a $55 million bond. This bond will be utilized to fund the construction of two 5-6 grade buildings and change the district to a PreK-4, 5-6, 7-8, and 9-12 building configuration. The future construction of these buildings will provide major support to overcrowding in the current PreK-5 elementary buildings.  SILO (School Infrastructure Local Option)  Voters in Linn County approved a 10-year School Infrastructure Local Option (SILO) Sales Tax on February 13, 2007. SILO tax revenues are distributed across all school districts in Linn County for the first five years of the tax. In 2008, the Iowa Legislature passed SAVE legislation which extended the penny sales tax for schools to 2029 and created an average per student allocation for school districts across the state. The increase in the sales and use tax from 5% to 6% was intended to replace the 1% SILO tax that had been in effect. To date, SILO revenue has allowed the district to build the new Novak Elementary school, air condition five schools, construct a 6,000 seat multipurpose stadium, install additional high school parking, purchase property to relocate Transportation and Operations & Maintenance, relocate the baseball and softball fields to the Oak Ridge property and construct an indoor aquatics center.  Enrollment  In the fall of 2017 Linn-Mar Community School District had a certified enrollment count of 7436 students. Since 2000 Linn-Mar’s certified enrollment number has grown at an average yearly rate of 2.24%. = Fall enrollment per year (since 2000) = 2000: 4,998 2001: 5,149 2002: 5,263 2003: 5,412 2004: 5,628 2005: 5,780 2006: 6,196 2007: 6,371 2008: 6,490 2009: 6,601 2010: 6,644 2011: 6,729 2012: 6,879 2013: 6,942 2014: 7,145 2015: 7,197 2016: 7,312  Test data  In the 2017-2018 school year Linn-Mar Community School District had a reading proficiency level of 84.1% compared to a state level of 77%. From 2014-2018 district ACT test scores averaged 24.34. The state average for the same timeframe was 21.675. In 2016 the national average for the ACT test was 20.8.

This term is typically used when addressing education policy and curriculum choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy. The science in STEM typically refers to two out of the three major branches of science: natural sciences, including biology, physics, and chemistry; and formal sciences, of which mathematics is an example, along with logic and statistics. The third major branch of science, social science such as: psychology, sociology, and political science, are categorized separately from the other two branches of science, and are instead grouped together with humanities and arts to form another counterpart acronym named HASS - Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. Psychology however is considered a major part of STEM, besides the other 2 subjects. In the United States/ United Kingdom education system, in elementary, middle, and high schools, the term science refers primarily to the natural sciences, with mathematics being a standalone subject, and the social sciences are combined with the humanities under the umbrella term social studies. The change was, in part, instigated at an interagency meeting by Peter Faletra the director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists. The acronym was adopted by Rita Colwell and other science administrators in the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2001. However, the acronym STEM predates NSF which was used by a variety of educators including Charles E. Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE). In the early 1990s, CAHSEE started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area called the STEM Institute. Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education, Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics and engineering education; it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM. One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which was founded in 1998 true to its word.

The peer country with the greatest proportion of STEM graduates, Finland, has over 30% of their university graduates coming from science, mathematics, computer science, and engineering programs. SHAD is an annual Canadian summer enrichment program for high- achieving high school students in July. The program focuses on academic learning particularly in STEAM fields. Scouts Canada has taken similar measures to their American counterpart to promote STEM fields to youth. Their STEM program began in 2015. In 2011 Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist Seymour Schulich established the Schulich Leader Scholarships, $100 million in $60,000 scholarships for students beginning their university education in a STEM program at 20 institutions across Canada. Each year 40 Canadian students would be selected to receive the award, two at each institution, with the goal of attracting gifted youth into the STEM fields. The program also supplies STEM scholarships to five participating universities in Israel. = China = To promote STEM in China, the Chinese government issued a guideline in 2016 on national innovation-driven development strategy, instructing that by 2020, China should become an innovative country; by 2030, it should be at the forefront of innovative countries; and by 2050, it should become a technology innovation power. In February 2017, the Ministry of Education in China has announced to officially add STEM education into the primary school curriculum, which is the first official government recognition of STEM education. And later, in May 2018, the launching ceremony and press conference for the 2029 Action Plan for China's STEM Education was held in Beijing, China. This plan aims to allow as many students to benefit from STEM education as possible and equip all students with scientific thinking and the ability to innovate. In response to encouraging policies by the government, schools in both public and private sectors around the country have begun to carry out STEM education programs. However, in order to effectively implement STEM curricula, full-time teachers specializing in STEM education and relevant contents to be taught are needed. At present, China lacks qualified STEM teachers and a training system is yet to be established. = Europe = Several European projects have promoted STEM education and careers in Europe. For instance, Scientix is a European cooperation of STEM teachers, education scientists, and policymakers. The SciChallenge project used a social media contest and the student-generated content to increase motivation of pre- university students for STEM education and careers.  France  The name of STEM in France is industrial engineering sciences (sciences industrielles or sciences de l'ingénieur). The STEM organization in France is the association UPSTI. = Hong Kong = STEM education has not been promoted among the local schools in Hong Kong until recent years. In November 2015, the Education Bureau of Hong Kong released a document titled Promotion of STEM Education, which proposes strategies and recommendations on promoting STEM education. = India = India is next only to China with STEM graduates per population of 1 to 52. The total fresh STEM graduates were 2.6 million in 2016. STEM graduates have been contributing to the Indian economy with well paid salaries locally and abroad since last two decades. The turnaround of Indian economy with comfortable foreign exchange reserves is mainly attributed to the skills of its STEM graduates. = Italy = In Middle Ages, Quadrivium was indicated the scientific \\"liberal arts\\" (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy) as opposed to Trivium for humanistic ones. = Philippines = In the Philippines, STEM is a two-year program and strand that is used for Senior High School (Grade 11 and 12), as signed by the Department of Education or DepEd. The STEM strand is under the Academic Track, which also include other strands like ABM, HUMMS, and GAS. The purpose of STEM strand is to educate students in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, in an interdisciplinary and applied approach, and to give students advance knowledge and application in the field. After completing the program, the students will earn a Diploma in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In some colleges and universities, they require students applying for STEM degrees (like medicine, engineering, computer studies, etc.) to be a graduate of STEM, if not, they will need to enter a bridging program.  List of STEM Degrees in the Philippines  Science Technology Engineering Mathematics = Qatar = In Qatar, AL-Bairaq is an outreach program to high-school students with a curriculum that focuses on STEM, run by the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at Qatar University. Each year around 946 students, from about 40 high schools, participate in AL- Bairaq competitions. AL-Bairaq make use of project-based learning, encourages students to solve authentic problems, and inquires them to work with each other as a team to build real solutions. Research has so far shown positive results for the program. = Singapore = STEM is part of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) that the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) has been promoting since 2013, and currently, all secondary schools have such a programme. It is expected that by 2023, all primary schools in Singapore will have an ALP. There are no tests or exams for ALPs. The emphasis is for students to learn through experimentation – they try, fail, try, learn from it and try again. The MOE actively supports schools with ALPs to further enhance and strengthen their capabilities and programmes that nurtures innovation and creativity. The Singapore Science Centre established a STEM unit in January 2014, dedicated to igniting students’ passion for STEM. To further enrich students’ learning experiences, their Industrial Partnership Programme (IPP) creates opportunities for students to get early exposure to the real-world STEM industries and careers. Curriculum specialists and STEM educators from the Science Centre will work hand-in-hand with teachers to co-develop STEM lessons, provide training to teachers and co-teach such lessons to provide students with an early exposure and develop their interest in STEM. St. Uriel Education, a specialist curriculum developer that was founded in Singapore and having active presence in China and Thailand, integrates Robotics and Arts into STEM curriculum - i.e. STREAM (Science Technology Robotics Engineering Arts and Maths). Their curriculum is aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and each lesson illustrates life-skills, universal values and ethics. Their research based curriculum attempts to not only develop 21st Century Skills, but also men and women who can do good and add value to the communities that they live in. = Thailand = In 2017, Thai Education Minister Dr Teerakiat Jareonsettasin said after the 49th Southeast Asia Ministers of Education Organisation (SEAMEO) Council Conference in Jakarta that the meeting approved the establishment of two new SEAMEO regional centres in Thailand. One would be the STEM Education Centre, while the other would be a Sufficient Economy Learning Centre. Teerakiat said that the Thai government had already allocated Bt250 million over five years for the new STEM centre. The centre will be the regional institution responsible for STEM education promotion. It will not only set up policies to improve STEM education, but it will also be the centre for information and experience sharing among the member countries and education experts. According to him, “This is the first SEAMEO regional centre for STEM education, as the existing science education centre in Malaysia only focuses on the academic perspective. Our STEM education centre will also prioritise the implementation and adaptation of science and technology.” Thailand government schools have been hampered by budget, but those private international schools have done an outreach to secure training for their STEM teachers and have explored the conduct of such training using latest robotics technologies and coding - such as those offered by St. Uriel Education. The Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology (IPST) has initiated a STEM Education Network whose objectives are to encourage integrated learning activities and enhance student creativity and application of knowledge in daily or professional life, and to establish a collaborative network of public and private organisations and personnel in promoting STEM education in Thailand. This network includes the National STEM Education Centre, 13 Regional STEM Education Centres, which were founded last year, schools in the STEM Education Network and other supporting networks. Regional STEM Education Centres are located in large-scale secondary schools in selected provinces, each centre works as a hub of academic support for teachers and educational personnel in the region and disseminates the STEM education concept in its areas of responsibility. These centres also act as a co-ordinating agency linking IPST, local personnel and institutes in basic and higher education, as well as other public and private organisations. Each of the 13 STEM Education Centres is a centre for six satellite schools in their locations: two primary schools, two secondary schools and two opportunity extension schools. In Bangkok, there are two centres: Bodindecha School and Samsenwittayalai School. The STEM Education Network also consists of subordinate networks and systems to support the operation of the major units. These include the Academic Mentor University Network, Supervisor Network, Academic Mentor Network, STEM Ambassador network, STEM Personnel Recognition Program and iSTEM Resource Centre. = Turkey = Turkish STEM Education Task Force (or FeTeMM—Fen Bilimleri, Teknoloji, Mühendislik ve Matematik) is a coalition of academicians and teachers who show an effort to increase the quality of education in STEM fields rather than focussing on increasing the number of STEM graduates. = United States = In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum. Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the public education agenda of the United States. The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States work visas for immigrants who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas. The term tends not to refer to the non-professional and less visible sectors of the fields, such as electronics assembly line work.  National Science Foundation  Many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the National Science Foundation on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broader definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of chemistry, computer and information technology science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, social sciences (anthropology, economics, psychology and sociology), and STEM education and learning research. Eligibility for scholarship programs such as the CSM STEM Scholars Program use the NSF definition. The NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences. Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and information science and engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geosciences, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.  Immigration policy  Although many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the National Science Foundation on what constitutes a STEM field, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy. In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM designated-degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States are able to remain in the country and receive training through work experience for up to 12 months. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can remain for an additional 17 months on an OPT STEM extension.  STEM-eligible degrees in US immigration  An exhaustive list of STEM disciplines does not exist because the definition varies by organization. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lists disciplines including architecture, physics, actuarial science, chemistry, biology, mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, computational science, psychology, biochemistry, robotics, computer engineering, electrical engineering, electronics, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, information science, information technology, civil engineering, aerospace engineering, chemical engineering, astrophysics, astronomy, optics, nanotechnology, nuclear physics, mathematical biology, operations research, neurobiology, biomechanics, bioinformatics, acoustical engineering, geographic information systems, atmospheric sciences, educational/instructional technology, software engineering, and educational research.  Education  By cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved. STEM supports broadening the study of engineering within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the \\"Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)\\" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects. In the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees. STEM education often uses new technologies such as RepRap 3D printers to encourage interest in STEM fields.J.L. Irwin, D.E. Oppliger, J.M. Pearce, G. Anzalone, Evaluation of RepRap 3D Printer Workshops in K-12 STEM. 122nd ASEE 122nd ASEE Conf. Proceedings, paper ID#12036, 2015. open access In 2006 the United States National Academies expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to: * Increase America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education * Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics and technology * Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees The National Aeronautics and Space Administration also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century. Individual states, such as California, have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success. Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where Florida Polytechnic University, Florida's first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), was established. During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S. Some states include New Jersey, Arizona, Virginia, North Carolina, Texas, and Ohio. Continuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program as well as the University of Cincinnati.  Racial gap in STEM fields  In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders.\\"Science and Engineering Indicators 2014.\\" S&E; Indicators 2014 - Figures - US National Science Foundation (NSF). N.p., n.d. Web. In 2011, eleven percent of the U.S. workforce was black, while only six percent of STEM workers were black.Landivar, Liana C. Disparities in STEM Employment by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin . Rep. N.p.: n.p., 2013. Though STEM in the U.S. has typically been dominated by white males, there have been considerable efforts to create initiatives to make STEM a more racially and gender diverse field.\\"FACT SHEET: President Obama Announces Over $240 Million in New STEM Commitments at the 2015 White House Science Fair.\\" National Archives and Records Administration. National Archives and Records Administration, n.d. Web. Some evidence suggests that all students, including black and Hispanic students, have a better chance of earning a STEM degree if they attend a college or university at which their entering academic credentials are at least as high as the average student's.Gail Heriot, Want to Be a Doctor? A Scientist? An Engineer?: An Affirmative Action Leg Up May Hurt Your Chances, Engage (2010). However, there is criticism that emphasis on STEM diversity has lowered academic standards.  Gender gaps in STEM  Although women make up 47% of the workforce \\"Women in STEM: 2017 Update\\", U.S. Department of Commerce. in the U.S., they hold only 24% of STEM jobs. Research suggests that exposing girls to female inventors at a young age has the potential to reduce the gender gap in technical STEM fields by half.\\"Who Becomes an Inventor in America? The Importance of Exposure to Innovation\\", Opportunity Insights. Campaigns from organizations like the National Inventors Hall of Fame aimed to achieve a 50/50 gender balance in their youth STEM programs by 2020.  American Competitiveness Initiative  In the State of the Union Address on January 31, 2006, President George W. Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced R&D; programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through DOE) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines. The NASA Means Business competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education. The National Science Foundation has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some Arizona schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields. The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit- status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students. It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model. The practices, strategies, and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under- represented minority and low-income student growth, close achievement gaps, decrease dropout rates, increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness. The STEM Academy represents a flexible use academic model that targets all schools and is for all students. Project Lead The Way (PLTW) is a leading provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. The national nonprofit organization has over 5,200 programs in over 4,700 schools in all 50 states. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called Pathway To Engineering, a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called Gateway To Technology. PLTW provides the curriculum and the teacher professional development and ongoing support to create transformational programs in schools, districts, and communities. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President Barack Obama and United States Secretary of Education Arne Duncan as well as various state, national, and business leaders.  STEM Education Coalition  The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Coalition works to support STEM programs for teachers and students at the U. S. Department of Education, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies that offer STEM-related programs. Activity of the STEM Coalition seems to have slowed since September 2008.  Scouting  In 2012, the Boy Scouts of America began handing out awards, titled NOVA and SUPERNOVA, for completing specific requirements appropriate to scouts' program level in each of the four main STEM areas. The Girl Scouts of the USA has similarly incorporated STEM into their program through the introduction of merit badges such as \\"Naturalist\\" and \\"Digital Art\\". SAE is an international organization, solutions'provider specialized on supporting education, award and scholarship programs for STEM matters, from pre-K to the College degree. It also promotes scientific and technologic innovation.  Department of Defense programs  The eCybermission is a free, web-based science, mathematics and technology competition for students in grades six through nine sponsored by the U.S. Army. Each webinar is focused on a different step of the scientific method and is presented by an experienced eCybermission CyberGuide. CyberGuides are military and civilian volunteers with a strong background in STEM and STEM education, who are able to provide valuable insight into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to students and team advisers. STARBASE is a premier educational program, sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs. Students interact with military personnel to explore careers and make connections with the \\"real world.\\" The program provides students with 20–25 hours of stimulating experiences at National Guard, Navy, Marines, Air Force Reserve and Air Force bases across the nation. SeaPerch is an innovative underwater robotics program that trains teachers to teach their students how to build an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in an in-school or out- of-school setting. Students build the ROV from a kit composed of low-cost, easily accessible parts, following a curriculum that teaches basic engineering and science concepts with a marine engineering theme.  NASA  NASAStem is a program of the U.S. space agency NASA to increase diversity within its ranks, including age, disability, and gender as well as race/ethnicity.  Legislation  The America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69) became law on August 9, 2007. It is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. The act authorizes funding increases for the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Standards and Technology laboratories, and the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008–FY2010. Robert Gabrys, Director of Education at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, articulated success as increased student achievement, early expression of student interest in STEM subjects, and student preparedness to enter the workforce.  Jobs  In November 2012 the White House announcement before congressional vote on the STEM Jobs Act put President Obama in opposition to many of the Silicon Valley firms and executives who bankrolled his re-election campaign. The Department of Labor identified 14 sectors that are \\"projected to add substantial numbers of new jobs to the economy or affect the growth of other industries or are being transformed by technology and innovation requiring new sets of skills for workers.\\" The identified sectors were as follows: advanced manufacturing, Automotive, construction, financial services, geospatial technology, homeland security, information technology, Transportation, Aerospace, Biotechnology, energy, healthcare, hospitality, and retail. The Department of Commerce notes STEM fields careers are some of the best-paying and have the greatest potential for job growth in the early 21st century. The report also notes that STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and training in STEM fields generally results in higher wages, whether or not they work in a STEM field. In 2015, there were around 9.0 million STEM jobs in the United States, representing 6.1% of American employment. STEM jobs were increasing around 9% percent per year. Brookings Institution found that the demand for competent technology graduates will surpass the number of capable applicants by at least one million individuals. The BLS noted that almost 100 percent of STEM jobs require postsecondary education, while only 36 percent of other jobs call for that same degree.  Trajectories of STEM graduates in STEM and Non-STEM jobs  According to the 2014 US Census \\"74 percent of those who have a bachelor's degree in science, technology, engineering and math — commonly referred to as STEM — are not employed in STEM occupations.\\"  Updates  In September 2017, a number of large American technology firms collectively pledged to donate $300 million for computer science education in the U.S. PEW findings revealed in 2018 that Americans identified several issues that hound STEM education which included unconcerned parents, disinterested students, obsolete curriculum materials, and too much focus on state parameters. 57 percent of survey respondents pointed out that one main problem of STEM is lack of students' concentration in learning. The recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) report card made public technology as well as engineering literacy scores which determines whether students have the capability to apply technology and engineering proficiency to real-life scenarios. The report showed a gap of 28 points between low-income students and their high-income counterparts. The same report also indicated a 38-point difference between white and black students. The Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) announced the release of a five-year strategic plan by the Committee on STEM Education of the National Science and Technology Council on December 4, 2018. The plan is entitled \\"Charting a Course for Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education.\\" The objective is to propose a federal strategy anchored on a vision for the future so that all Americans are given permanent access to premium-quality education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In the end, the United States can emerge as world leader in STEM mastery, employment, and innovation. The goals of this plan are building foundations for STEM literacy; enhancing diversity, equality, and inclusion in STEM; and preparing the STEM workforce for the future. The 2019 fiscal budget proposal of the White House supported the funding plan in President Donald Trump's Memorandum on STEM Education which allocated around $200 million (grant funding) on STEM education every year. This budget also supports STEM through a grant program worth $20 million for career as well as technical education programs.  Events and programs to help develop STEM in US schools  * FIRST Tech Challenge * VEX Robotics Competitions * FIRST Robotics Competition * The Tech Museum Challenge = Vietnam = In Vietnam, beginning in 2012 many private education organizations have STEM education initiatives. In 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Liên minh STEM organized the first National STEM day, followed by many similar events across the country. in 2015, Ministry of Education and Training included STEM as an area needed to be encouraged in national school year program. In May 2017, Prime Minister signed a Directive no. 16http://vanban.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=2&mode;=detail&document;_id=189610 stating: \\"Dramatically change the policies, contents, education and vocational training methods to create a human resource capable of receiving new production technology trends, with a focus on promoting training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), foreign languages, information technology in general education; \\" and asking \\"Ministry of Education and Training (to): Promote the deployment of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in general education program; Pilot organize in some high schools from 2017 to 2018.  Women  \\"Woman teaching geometry\\" Illustration at the beginning of a medieval translation of Euclid's Elements () Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs. In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014). In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts. The gender ratio depends on field of study. For example, in the European Union in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.  Criticism  The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article \\"The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage\\" in The Atlantic, demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, \\"No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher\\", and that \\"Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably- skilled occupations.\\" Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since World War II to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in \\"mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts\\"; including one driven by the Space Race of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to \\"a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s.\\" IEEE Spectrum contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article \\"The STEM Crisis Is a Myth\\", also noting that there was a \\"mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job\\" in the United States, with only around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree. Economics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for FiveThirtyEight, wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, \\"many sciences, particularly the life sciences, pay below the overall median for recent college graduates.\\"  See also  * American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) * Hard and soft science * List of African American women in STEM fields * Maker culture * NASA RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge * National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) * Pre-STEM * Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network * Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) * STEAM fields * STEM Academy * STEM.org * STEM pipeline *Underrepresented group  References  = Citations = = Sources = *  Further reading     UNESCO PUBLICATION ON GIRLS EDUCATION IN STEM -Cracking the code: girls’ and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) \\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002534/253479E.pdf \\" *  External links  * NASA information for educators Category:Education by subject Category:Education policy Category:Experiential learning Category:Science education Category:Engineering education Category:Mathematics education Category:Learning programs Category:Science and technology studies ","title":"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics"},{"id":"3437670","text":"Gober's Untitled (Leg), 1989-90, beeswax, cotton, wood, leather and human hair, Museum of Modern Art, New York Robert Gober (born September 12, 1954) is an American sculptor. His work is often related to domestic and familiar objects such as sinks, doors, and legs. Early life and education Gober was born in Wallingford, Connecticut and studied literature and then fine artRobert Gober Museum of Modern Art, New York. at Middlebury College, Vermont and the Tyler School of Art in Rome. Gober settled in New York in 1976 and initially earned his living as a carpenter, crafting stretchers for artists and renovating lofts.Robert Gober Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. He also worked as an assistant to the painter Elizabeth Murray for five years.Robert Gober National Gallery of Art, Washington. Work During Gober's initial years in the art world he first focused on painting. He then decided to do sculptures and to broaden his scope of art in the 1980s. Gober's work is often related to domestic and familiar objects such as sinks, doors, and legs, and has themes of nature, sexuality, religion, and politics. The sculptures are meticulously handcrafted, even when they appear to just be a re-creation of a common sink. While he is best known for his sculptures, he has also made photographs, prints, drawings and has curated exhibitions. In 1982-83, Gober created Slides of a Changing Painting, consisting of 89 images of paintings made on a small piece of plywood in his storefront studio in the East Village; he made a slide of each motif, then scraped off the paint and began again.Roberta Smith (October 2, 2014), Reality Skewed and Skewered (Gushing, Too) – ‘Robert Gober: The Heart Is Not a Metaphor,’ at MoMA New York Times. One of his most well known series of more than 50 increasingly eccentric sinks – made of plaster, wood, wire lath, and coated in layers of semi-gloss enamelJerry Saltz (October 1, 2014), Art Review: The Great, Inscrutable Robert Gober New York Magazine. – which he produced in the mid-1980s.Jason Farago (October 3, 2014), Robert Gober opens at MoMA: sober, haunting and genuinely affecting The Guardian. By 1989, Gober was casting beeswax into sculptures of men's legs, completed not only with shoes and trouser legs but also human hair that was inserted into the beeswax. In the Whitney Biennial 2012, Gober curated a room of Forrest Bess's paintings and archival materials dealing with the artist's exploration into hermaphrodism.David Colman (March 16, 2012), Art Between the Cracks New York Times. He also curated \\"Heat Waves in a Swamp: The Paintings of Charles Burchfield\\" at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles in 2009 (which traveled to the Burchfield Penney Art Center, Buffalo and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York in 2010).  Art plays a role during the AIDS epidemic  During the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, Robert Gober, along with other artists, used art to support the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP). ACT UP was a large group of people that were infuriated by the lack of action from the government and scientists to stop the spread of AIDS and find a cure. A few artists, including Gober, organized an art auction to help raise funds to donate to ACT UP. Gober's Untitled (Leg),1989-90, alone was sold at a very high price, which helped prove to the public that art can be used to make the voices of the people be heard, to fight for a cause that is important to the communities, and that art is not just a commodity,nor is art just for pleasure. Robert Gober's sculptures portrayed a different aspect to the way art had been seen, he used his sculptures to send a strong message to the viewers. Exhibitions In 1984, the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York hosted Gober's first solo exhibition. The Art Institute of Chicago presented the artist's first museum exhibition in 1988.Phyllis Braff (October 7, 2001), A North Fork Artist at the Venice Biennale New York Times. Gober has since had exhibitions of his work in Europe and North America. He represented the United States at the 2001 Venice Biennale and has had several one-person museum exhibitions including at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Jeu de Paume, Paris, and Dia Art Foundation, New York. His work has also been included in five Whitney Biennials, including the 2000 Whitney Biennial with Sarah Sze, Doug Aitken, Cai Guo-Qiang, Louise Lawler and Richard Tuttle. In 2007 there was a retrospective exhibition of his work at the Schaulager in Basel.https://www.schaulager.org/en/activities/exhibitions/robert-gober The exhibition was accompanied by a comprehensive book of his sculptures entitled Robert Gober. Sculptures and Installations 1979-2007. Gober participated in the group show Lifelike that originated at the Walker Art Center in 2012. From October 2014 to January 2015, The Museum of Modern Art, New York presented \\"Robert Gober: The Heart Is Not a Metaphor\\", a 40-year retrospective of his work including approximately 130 sculptures, paintings, drawings, prints and photographs. This exhibition was the first large-scale display in the United States.https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1452 It was also accompanied by a catalogue of the same name including essays by Hilton Als, Ann Temkin and Christian Scheidemann, plus a chronology by Claudia Carson and Paulina Pobocha with Robert Gober.http://www.momastore.org/museum/moma/ProductDisplay_Robert%20Gober%20The%20Heart%20Is%20Not%20a%20Metaphor_10451_10001_192542_-1_26683_11486_192544 Gober created a three-story permanent installation in the Haunted House at the Fondazione Prada, Milan which opened in May 2015. In autumn 2016, two new sculptures by Gober were included in the Artangel exhibition at Reading Prison in England.

It is one of the Burial Acts 1852 to 1885. Its purpose is to regulate burial grounds. It regulates where and how deceased people may be buried, and provides for the exhumation of remains. The Act made it illegal to disturb a grave (other than for an officially sanctioned exhumation). The Act did not make it illegal to steal a dead body, and it is only the opening of the grave which constitutes an offence, not the removal of the contents.  Guidance for Burial Ground Managers  The Government Department for Constitutional Affairs provides guidance for burial ground managers, and many aspect of it relate to provisions contained in the Burial Act 1857.  Disturbing a Burial and Exhumation  Concerns arose that due to pressures of population movement to urban areas during the Industrial revolution that burial graves were reused too quickly. The offence of disturbing a burial included in the Burial Act 1857 was based on the Victorian value that a burial was for eternity. Section 25 of the Burial Act 1857 makes it unlawful in England and Wales to disturb human burials without a licence from the Secretary of State, or on ground consecrated by the rites of the Church of England, without the permission of the church. The mechanisms about how the Church of England provides this permission slightly differs depending if the remains are at a church or cathedral. In Scotland, the law is different and covered by the Burial and Cremations Act (Scotland) Act 2016. The powers for a coroner to permit an exhumation fall outside the scope of the Burial Act 1857 and The Coroners And Justice Act 2009 allows them to authorise an exhumation for the purposes of a post-mortem and in relation criminal proceedings.  Viewpoint of Licensing Authorities on Exhumation  The Blagdon Cemetery [2002] Court of Arches case is the basis of the Church of England exhumation guidelines. The viewpoint of the Church of England is burial is final and only grants exhumation in exceptional circumstances. The Advisory Panel on the Archaeology of Burials in England is a partnership between Historic England, and the Church of England providing guidance based on the law, archaeological research, and theology. In England and Wales, The Ministry of Justice holds the right to issue exhumation licence. Before issuing a licence, consent is required from close relatives of the deceased, grave owner, and burial authority.  Modern amendments  In 2004, the Government, in response to the problem of the lack of space for new burials, partly a consequence of the Burial Act 1857, held a consultation called, “Burial Law and Policy in the 21st Century”. The consultation considered how to address the problem that when a burial ground became full, it generated no income from new burials, and without income, it may become difficult to maintain and fall into neglect. London Burial Authorities in some instances could reclaim and reuse a grave after 75 years, under the London Authorities Act 2007. Extending this provision elsewhere in the country was deliberated. The consultation considered the ‘Exclusive Rights for Burial’. When purchasing a grave, a person usually buys the right to exclusively be buried in it for a period, often 100 years, they do not buy the land. Noted was the possibility of reusing graves with the permission of the Church of England. Section 25 of the Burial Act 1857, amended by Section 2 of the Church of England (Miscellaneous Provisions) Measures 2014 permitted the disturbance of graves with Church of England permission. Successive Government have considered the problem of lack of space for graves but not taken any action.

They are part of the wider Visayan ethnolinguistic group, who constitute the largest Filipino ethnolinguistic group. Demographics The Masbateño 677,942 in 2010. They are the descendants of the Austronesian-immigrants who came from South China during the Iron Age who probably came to Masbate after reaching the more southern Visayan islands. Masbateños may be considered Visayans by language but are Bicolanos by region. They speak the Masbateño language, a Visayan language and almost all practice Roman Catholicism. Culture Most of the people of Masbate speak Masbateño a language that is closely related to Hiligaynon and Capiznon. However, in various municipalities of the island, various other languages are spoken. In the vicinity of the towns of Cataingan, Palanas and Dimasalang, most residents speak Waray-Waray. In Pio Corpuz the people speak Cebuano while in Placer and in the west coast along coast of Mandaon, Hiligaynon (Ilonggo) and Capiznon are spoken. Bicolano is also spoken by the residents. The province of Masbate is known as cattle country. The cattle breed found on the island was taken from herds in India that have flourished in the benign climate of the island. The province is the second largest supplier of cattle that is brought to Manila for slaughter. This industry has inspired the establishment of a 'Rodeo Filipino' on the third week of June. This festival features a week-long tournament of bull riding, cattle wrestling, lassoing, calf casting, post driving, carabao racing and a host of other ‘rodeo’ games. This unique observance is also accompanied by cattle raising contests, a trade fair and parades, much like the rodeos in the American West.

She began her career in the field of commercial photography but soon started her own agency which specialised in family portraits, and wedding photos. In the 1970s, she refocused her work towards documentary photography, adopting a politicized approach to her art form, with socialist and feminist themes revisited throughout her career. Self-portraits about her own fight with breast cancer, depicting various stages of her breast cancer to subvert the notion of an idealized female form, inspired projects in 'photo therapy', a means of using the medium to work on psychological health.  Life  Jo Spence was born on 15 June 1934 in London to working class parents. She started off as a wedding photographer and ran a studio from 1967–1974. Soon afterwards, she began documentary work in the early 1970s, motivated by her political concerns. Both a socialist and feminist, she worked to represent these issues through her practice of photography, first as a founding member of the Hackney Flashers (1974), a collective of broadly feminist and socialist women who produced exhibitions such as 'Women and Work' and 'Who's Holding the Baby'. She was subsequently active in establishing the Photography Workshop (1974), a group focused on education and publishing, including its Camerawork magazine (1976–1985), along with the socialist historian of photography Terry Dennett (1938-2018), with whom she continued to collaborate for the rest of her life. In 1979, Spence studied the theory and practice of photography at the Polytechnic of Central London with photo theorist Victor Burgin. She gained a first class Honours Degree and moved on from her previous notions of photography, taking greater account of visual semiotics manifested in the medium. With fellow students Mary Ann Kennedy, Jane Munro and Charlotte Pembrey, Spence co-founded The Polysnappers. During the late 1970s and into the early 1980s her work became more focused on themes of domesticity and family life. In a companion piece for Beyond the Family Album, Public Images, Private Conventions she wrote on how she wished to \\"question [...] who represents who in society, how they do it and for what purpose.\\" In 1982, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. After her diagnosis, Spence started to focus on identity, subjectivity, mental and physical health. She rejected conventional therapy and explored holistic therapy and the personal and feminist political dimension of living with cancer. It was through experiencing the effectiveness of using photography in confronting and documenting her hospitalisation and illness that Spence, with Rosy Martin, developed 'photo therapy' in which the subject was empowered to control their image to discover and represent unexpressed or repressed feelings and ideas. By working collaboratively the person in front of the camera was both subject and author of the image.Paul Pieroni, Joe Scotland, Louise Shelley, George Vasey (eds). 2012.

Directed by Steve Boyum, it stars Courtnee Draper, Tamara Hope, Lance Guest, and Khrystyne Haje. Summary Megan Larson is an ordinary 16-year old teenage girl. Her workaholic father Fred and windsurfing mother Kathy are divorced, and Megan longs for them to get back together as much as she longs for her little brother Trevor to be less annoying. But the thing she wants the most is for popular boy Cutter to be her boyfriend, so her dearest wish is to be in with the popular group. Things begin to get out of control when her mother meets Cosmo Cola, a nice but very strange man. He has a pretty and intelligent daughter named Ariel who is even weirder than her dad. Ariel hides under her father's car when the wind blows because she is afraid of wind, talks in a sophisticated manner, wears many layers to 'protect her essence' and cannot ride a bicycle, even with training wheels and a football helmet. Mostly she complains that she hates the town where they live and wants to return to her hometown in Yukon to be with her boyfriend Fanul. Worst of all for Megan, the kids at school think that the way Ariel behaves is 'cool and revolutionary'. Her teachers believe her mannerisms are poetic, and she even gets to sit at the popular table on her first day, which attracts Cutter's attention. What Megan does not realize is that Ariel and her father are aliens from Planet Zircalon. Because Ariel's father was a freedom fighter on their home planet, they escaped to Earth, leaving behind their home, Ariel's mother who perished in the escape, and Ariel's boyfriend Fanul who is the son of the tyrannical emperor S'Vad. On her home planet, every citizen is a gaseous bubble that floats carelessly, so Ariel is very uncomfortable with the solid objects of Earth. She hates everything on Earth: her name, the way the wind blows, food, the solid objects and the people. \\"Every time I look at this horrid vehicle; the rubbery flesh, the flat face, the ghastly yellow hair that grows out of this hideous skull, I can only think I am grotesque.\\" Ariel and Megan become enemies despite Megan's mother's engagement to Ariel's father. As Ariel and Megan realize that they both want to break up their parents, they agree on a temporary alliance to achieve their common goal. However, none of their plans work out. After a while, Megan begins to suspect something especially unusual is occurring and discovers that Ariel and Cosmo are aliens. Fanul and S'Vad arrive to take Ariel and Cosmo home to Zircalon, but Fanul turns on his father after Megan, Ariel, and Cutter convince him of the benefits of freedom. As Ariel's race is vulnerable to wind, she, Megan, Cutter, Fanul, and Trevor are able to defeat S'Vad with a leaf blower and hairdryers. After S'Vad is defeated, Cosmo marries Kathy, Megan and Fanul develop feelings for each other while Ariel and Cutter do the same, and Ariel and Megan become best friends. Fanul plans to return home and take over as ruler after the death of his father, but also plans to make changes to the way things are run and to grant the people freedom. Fanul promises to return to Earth occasionally to visit Megan. Megan and Ariel realize that even though they are from different worlds they are a lot alike.

He aided European-American settlement of large areas of southern Utah and northern Arizona, where he was seen as an honest broker between Mormon settlers and the Natives. He is sometimes referred to as the \\"Buckskin Apostle,\\" or the \\"Apostle to the Lamanites.\\"Early Latter-day Saints referred to Native Americans as \\"Lamanites,\\" a term derived from the Book of Mormon. In 1958, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Early life and family Hamblin was born in Salem, Ohio, to a family of farmers. He grew up learning farming. He was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on March 3, 1842, at the age of 22. Hamblin and his first wife Lucinda had four children. When Hamblin proposed moving west with the Latter-day Saints to the Salt Lake Valley, Lucinda refused to go. In February 1849, Hamblin and Lucinda decided to end their marriage, and he continued west without her, taking the four children with him. In September, Hamblin met and married Rachel Judd, a widow, in Council Bluffs, Iowa. He and Rachel had five children. Hamblin lived the Mormon doctrine of plural marriage, and he married Sarah Priscilla Leavitt on September 11, 1857, Eliza Hamblin on February 14, 1863 (see Todd Compton, book) with whom he had one child, Clara Melvina Hamblin B. Nov. 5, 1876 (their daughter was raised by Priscilla after Eliza left Jacob for Paiute Poinkum), and Louisa Bonelli on November 16, 1865. With Leavitt he had 14 children and also raised Clara (https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/sarah-priscilla- leavitt-24-j7dt0), and with Bonelli he had 6 children. Leavitt and Bonelli were sealed to him in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City. Conversion to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and migration west As an adult, Hamblin and his family lived in Spring Prairie, Wisconsin. Hamblin was injured and thought he would die of his wound. Hamblin prayed that if he survived, he would serve God the rest of his life. Soon after, a woman knocked on his door who said she had felt called to go to his house. A nurse, she had the medicines and poultices needed, and helped heal Hamblin's wound and saved his life. From then on Hamblin turned to God. In 1842, he and his children converted to Mormonism. They moved from Wisconsin to Nauvoo, Illinois, where the Latter Day Saints had gathered. After Joseph Smith's death, Hamblin witnessed the \\"succession crisis\\" among the Mormons. He became a supporter of Brigham Young for the leadership of the church and, with the majority of Latter-day Saints, affiliated himself with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In his memoir, Hamblin wrote of the moment he decided to support Young: > \\"On the 8th of August, 1844, I attended a general meeting of the Saints. > Elder Rigdon was there, urging his claims to the Presidency of the Church. > His voice did not sound like the voice of the true shepherd. When he was > about to call a vote of the congregation to sustain him as President of the > Church, Elders Brigham Young, Parley P. Pratt and Heber C. Kimball (all > members of the Quorum of the Twelve) stepped into the stand. Brigham Young > remarked to the congregation: 'I will manage this voting for Elder Rigdon. > He does not preside here. This child' (meaning himself) 'will manage this > flock for a season.' The voice and gestures of the man were those of the > Prophet Joseph. The people, with few exceptions, visibly saw that the mantle > of the Prophet Joseph Smith had fallen upon Brigham Young. To some it seemed > as though Joseph again stood before them. I arose to my feet and said to a > man sitting by me, 'That is the voice of the true shepherd—the chief of the > Apostles'.\\" Richard Van Wagoner,\\"The Making of a Mormon Myth: The 1844 Transfiguration of Brigham Young\\", \\"Dialogue : A Journal of Mormon Thought\\", 1995, Pages 1-24 Hamblin was a Mormon pioneer and in 1850 settled in Tooele, near Salt Lake City. He became well known for creating good relations between the white settlers and Indians. After an altercation, when his gun failed to fire as he shot at an Indian, Hamblin said God had revealed he was to be a \\"messenger of peace\\" to the Indians, and that if he did not thirst for their blood, he should never fall by their hands. In 1854, Hamblin was called by President Young to serve a mission to the southern Paiute Indians and settled at Santa Clara in the vicinity of the modern city of St. George, Utah. Hamblin's first home in Sant Clara was destroyed by a flash flood. His second wife, Rachael, saved one of their young children from drowning, but the child died soon after from exposure. Rachael never fully recovered from the exposure she got from the flood. Swearing to avoid the risk of flood, Hamblin built a new home on a hill in Santa Clara. Owned today by the LDS Church, the house is operated as a museum, where Mormon missionaries give tours daily. Utah War and the Mountain Meadows massacre Location of Jacob Hamblin's home in the Mountain Meadows In August 1857, Brigham Young made Hamblin President of the Santa Clara Indian Mission. Young directed Hamblin by letter to > continue the conciliatory policy towards the Indians which I have ever > commended, and seek by works of righteousness to obtain their love and > confidence. Omit promises where you are not sure you can fill them; and seek > to unite the hearts of the brethren on that mission, and let all under your > direction be united together in holy bonds of love and unity. Young had become aware in July of an approaching United States army ordered to invade the Utah Territory to put down a supposed \\"rebellion\\" among the Mormons. Anticipating what would become known as the Utah War, Young urged Hamblin to \\"not permit the brethren to part with their guns and ammunition, but save them against the hour of need.\\" He wrote to Hamblin that the Indians \\"must learn to help us or the United States will kill us both.\\" In late August, Hamblin traveled north to Salt Lake City with President George A. Smith, who had been dispatched to the southern Mormon colonies to warn of the approaching U.S. army and recommend against colonists' trading with non- Mormons then traveling through their territory. At Corn Creek near Fillmore, Utah, Smith, Hamblin, and Thales Haskell encountered the Baker–Fancher party, a wagon train of Arkansans en route to California. Hamblin suggested to them that they stop further south in the grassy Mountain Meadows, where he maintained a homestead at a traditional stopping point on the Old Spanish Trail from New Mexico to California. Hamblin and his party continued on to Salt Lake City, where he stayed for roughly a week to \\"conduct Indian business and take a plural wife.\\" This \\"Indian business\\" included bringing a delegation of Southern Paiute to meet with LDS Church leaders. In Salt Lake City, Hamblin reported later that he was told that the Fanchers had \\"behaved badly\\" and had \\"robbed hen-roosts, and been guilty of other irregularities, and had used abusive language to those who had remonstrated with them. It was also reported that they threatened, when the army came into the north end of the Territory, to get a good outfit from the weaker settlements in the south.\\" By one account, Hamblin was on his way home and was met by his adopted Indian son, Albert, who recounted the horror of the slaughter of the Baker–Fancher Party in the infamous Mountain Meadows massacre. In fact, on his trail south, he also met John D. Lee who was on his way to Salt Lake City. In both his autobiography and his testimony at the second trial of Lee for the massacre, Hamblin claimed that to his great distress, Lee admitted to him his role in the killings along with other Mormons, although he placed the blame for the attack on the Paiutes. Many accept Hamblin's account of his meeting with Lee because Hamblin was well known for honesty. (Professor A. H. Thompson of the U.S. Geological survey once said, \\"I would trust my money, my life and my honor in the keeping of Jacob Hamblin, knowing all would be safe\\"), Hamblin's home in Santa Clara As Hamblin continued south towards Santa Clara, he was told that a band of Paiutes was planning to attack a second wagon train, the Duke party. Perhaps believing Lee's account that the Indians were primarily responsible for the Mountain Meadows massacre, he quickly returned south to prevent another slaughter. He recounts that he did not himself overtake that wagon train, but as he had been traveling very quickly without sleep he sent Samuel Knight and Dudley Leavitt before him. Knight and Leavitt overtook the train and were able to negotiate with the Paiutes wherein the Indians took the trains' loose cattle (nearly 500 head) and left the train in peace. Knight and Leavitt continued with the company and saw it safely through to California. Hamblin was later able to return that stock to the Duke party after conferring with those Indians involved. Upon reaching the massacre site, the diary of Sarah Priscilla Leavitt, Hamblin's third wife, recounts the horrors of her lying in the covered wagon as they got to the scene. Although Hamblin warned her to not look out, she peeked for a few seconds, which she always regretted. The remaining children that survived (some accounts say 17, some say 20) were brought to the Hamblin home that night. Sarah cared for three of the children herself. Eventually, federal agents returned all the children to their Arkansas relatives. Brevet Major J. H. Carelton interviewed Albert, who gave a detailed account of what he saw of the massacre. Later, he was found lying face down dead in a cactus. Sarah wrote in her diary that both she and Hamblin felt his knowledge of what really happened at the massacre resulted in his murder. Hamblin spent the rest of 1857 and early 1858 shepherding non-Mormons through Utah on the trail to California and Mormons returning to Utah from outlying settlements in order to participate in its defense should the army attack. After the conclusion of the Utah War, Hamblin claims to have been willing to testify to his knowledge of the massacre at the behest of George A. Smith. However, due to the amnesty proclaimed by the President of the United States to the Mormons, the new governor, Alfred Cumming, did not wish to discuss the matter. Hamblin did, however, testify at Lee's second trial for the massacre in 1876. Later missions to Native Americans Hopi village of Oraibi The Vermillion Cliffs near Lee's Ferry Aerial photograph of Jacob Hamblin Park, Kanab Utah, spring 2017 In 1858, while he was in Salt Lake City, Hamblin was made a sub-Indian agent. That same year he was called on a mission to the Moquis (Hopis) of northern Arizona. He traveled southeast through Pipe Springs, crossed the Buckskin Mountain (Kaibab Plateau), and forded the Colorado River at the Crossing of the Fathers which is now under Lake Powell at Padre Bay. This was somewhat north of the later crossing at Lee's Ferry which he discovered. Upon his arrival at the village of Oraibi, he was told by the Hopis that it was prophesied that he and his companions would come and bring the Hopi knowledge which they formerly had. However, they were also told that the Hopi would not cross over the Colorado River to live with the Mormons until the three prophets which had led them to their mesas returned to give them further instructions. (See Hopi mythology). The Hopi also questioned why they should cross the Colorado River to meet the Mormons when they would soon have settlements to their south in any case. At the time there were no plans for Mormon settlements to the south of the Hopi, although Hamblin helped found Mormon settlements on the Little Colorado River years later. Hamblin went home, but returned on several occasions to keep up good relations with the Hopis and the Navajos. In 1862, three Hopi men accompanied him to Salt Lake City to meet Brigham Young. In 1870 he brought a minor Hopi leader, Toova, and his wife across the Colorado River to visit the Mormon settlements in southern Utah. Tuba eventually joined the LDS Church, and invited the Mormons to settle near his village of Moencopi where they founded Tuba City, named in honor of their Hopi friend. Earl Spendlove's article, \\"Let Me Die in Peace,\\" states that Hamblin originally purchased Eliza, a Paiute from Utah of the Shivwit or Cedar Band, to free her from slavery. Hamblin adopted Eliza when she was a teen. Hamblin and Eliza bore one child, a girl named Clara Melvina Hamblin, on November 5, 1876 (see Autobiography of Sarah Priscilla Hamblin donated by Sharon Black). Jacob later took wives Priscilla and Louisa, along with Mary Elizabeth, Clara Melvina, Jake (Jacob Jr.), and the rest of his kids to Kanab, Arizona. A Paiute known as Old Poinkum had run off with Hamblin's bride Eliza and hid her in New Harmony Valley, Utah; Eliza left her baby girl Clara with Jacob and Priscilla. Later, after Priscilla Hamblin left Nutrioso ranch in Arizona, she and Jacob moved to Eagar, then Alpine, Arizona. Priscilla never told Clara Melvina about her mother Eliza (whom Jacob nicknamed \\"Suzie\\"). However, Priscilla's kids eventually figured out that Clara was not Priscilla's biological child, as Priscilla had coal black hair and did not look like the like Priscilla's other kids. Louisa Hamblin later wrote to her daughter that she had knit a pair of \\"pink stockings\\" for \\"Eliza's baby\\". (Note: Jacob and Eliza have living relatives: Priscilla Turner, Jim Turner, Theresa Bingham, Douglas Bingham. Eliza's cause of death and place of burial unknown.) Hamblin was an invaluable diplomat between the Latter-day Saints and the Native Americans, surviving numerous dangerous encounters between the two. In 1870 he also acted as an adviser to John Wesley Powell before his second journey through the Grand Canyon. Hamblin acted as a negotiator to ensure safety for Powell's expedition from local Native tribes. Powell related that Hamblin \\"speaks [the Indians'] language well and has great influence over the Indians in the region round about. He is a silent, reserved man, and when he speaks it is in a slow, quiet way that inspires great awe.\\" Said a Native Chief to Powell, \\"We believe in Jacob, and look upon you as a father .... We will tell [the other Indians] that [Powell] is Jacob's friend.\\" Hamblin attributed much of his success with the Indians to his conviction that he \\"had received from the Lord an assurance that I should never fall by the hands of the Indians, if I did not thirst for their blood.\\" Indeed, on many occasions, Hamblin dealt with hostile Indians with no companion and carrying no weapon to defend himself. During one particularly trying period in 1874, three Navajo Indians were shot by a member of the Butch Cassidy gang in central Utah. Hamblin had previously promised the Navajos they could safely trade with the Mormons in that area, and Mormons were falsely blamed for the killing. Hamblin was asked by Brigham Young to talk with the angry Navajos and avert war, but Hamblin's local bishop made two desperate attempts to keep him from walking into a \\"certain death-trap\\". Hamblin refused to return home, stating that \\"I have been appointed to a mission by the highest authority of God on Earth [Brigham Young]. My life is but of small moment compared with the lives of the Saints and the interests of the Kingdom of God.\\" One eye-witnessLetter to the Pioche, Nevada Register dated Feb. 5, 1874, submitted by Mr. J. E. Smith to the events that followed, reported that \\"no braver man ever lived.\\" Hamblin offered his rules for dealing with the Indians as follows: > #I never talk anything but the truth to them. #I think it useless to speak > of things they cannot comprehend. #I strive by all means to never let them > see me in a passion. #Under no circumstances show fear, thereby showing to > them that I have a sound heart and a straight tongue. #Never approach them > in an austere manner nor use more words than are necessary to convey my > ideas, not in a higher tone of voice than to be distinctly heard. #Always > listen to them when they wish to tell of their grievances, and redress their > wrongs, however trifling they may be if possible. If I cannot I let them > know I have a desire to do so. #I never allow them to hear me use profane or > obscene language or take any unbecoming course with them. #I never submit to > any unjust demands or submit to coercion under any circumstances, thereby > showing them that I govern and am governed by the rule of right not by > might. Hamblin added, \\"I believe if the rules that I have mentioned were observed there should be little difficulty on our frontier with the Red Man.\\" He treated the Native Americans as intelligent equals. He said, \\"some people call the Indians superstitious. I admit the fact, but do not think that they are more so than many who call themselves civilized. There are few people who have not received superstitious traditions from their fathers. The more intelligent part of the Indians believe in one Great Father of all; also in evil influences, and in revelation and prophecy; and in many of their religious rites and ideas, I think they are quite as consistent as the Christian sects of the day.\\" Hamblin kept a home in Kanab, Utah (Kanab's city park is named Jacob Hamblin Park). Hamblin started a ranch in the House Rock Valley in the Arizona Strip at the base of the Vermillion Cliffs. Jacob Lake, Arizona, on the Kaibab Plateau north of the Grand Canyon is named after him, as is Jacob Hamblin Arch in Coyote Gulch and Hamblin Wash along U.S. Highway 89 in northern Arizona. In 1963, the actor David Brian played Hamblin in the episode \\"The Peacemaker\\" of the syndicated western television series Death Valley Days. In the episode, Hamblin works feverishly to hold the peace treaty with the Navajo after a white man kills some Indians who come onto his property. Bing Russell, Michael Pate, and Richard Webb also appeared in this episode. At the end of the broadcast one of Hamblin's grandsons appeared with host Stanley Andrews, who noted a historical marker which honors Hamblin's work on behalf of peace on the frontier.

A veteran of World War II and a photographer, he emigrated to the United States in 1960 and had many exhibitions in Europe and North America. He was on the founding editorial staff of Artforum from 1962 to 1971, and was Editor-in-Chief from 1972 to 1977.  Early life and WWII service  John Coplans was born in London in 1920. His father, was Joseph Moses Coplans a medical doctor and a Renaissance man of many scientific and artistic talents. His father left England for Johannesburg while John was an infant. At the age of two, John was brought to his father in South Africa; from 1924-1927 the family was in flux between London and South Africa, settling in a seaside Cape Town suburb until 1930. Despite the instability of his early home life, Coplans developed an enormous admiration for his father, who took him to galleries on the weekends and instilled within him a love for exploration, experimentation, and a fascination with the world. In 1937, John Coplans boarded a Union Castle ship and returned to England from South Africa. The eighteen-year-old Coplans was commissioned into the Royal Air Force as an Acting Pilot Officer. Due to his hearing being affected by a rugby match, two years later, he volunteered for the army. His childhood experience living in Africa led to his appointment to the King’s African Rifles in East Africa. He was active as a platoon commander (primarily in Ethiopia) until 1943, after which his unit was deployed to Burma. In 1945, after eight years serving in the army, Coplans returned to civilian life and decided to become an artist.  Early career  After WWII, Coplans settled in London, rooming at the Abbey Art Center; he wanted to become an artist. The British government was giving grants to recent veterans of the war as the city rebuilt itself, and he received one such grant to study art. He tried both Goldsmiths and Chelsea College of the Arts, but found that art school did not suit him. He painted part-time whilst running his business John Rivers Limited. It specialised in interior decorating and he worked for Cecil Beaton, Basil Deardon and other luminaries of the time. In the mid-1950s, Coplans began attending lectures by Lawrence Alloway at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Here he was introduced to the budding Pop Art movement, which he would become deeply involved in as both critic and curator. His experience viewing exhibitions such as the Hard-Edged Painting exhibition (ICA, 1959) and New American Painting (The Tate, 1959) helped to solidify his growing passion for not just Pop Art, but American art as well. During this period he struggled as a young artist to find his artistic voice, and developed an abstract painting practice which reflected trends of tachism and Abstract Expressionism pioneered by Americans Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. Coplans would later refer to this early painting work as \\"derivative\\"; these paintings were shown in exhibitions at the Royal Society of British Artists (1950) and later at the New Vision Center. In 1960, Coplans sold all of his belongings and moved to the United States, initially settling in San Francisco and taking a position at UC Berkeley as a visiting assistant design professor. Here he met gallerist Phil Leider, the future editor of ArtForum. Leider connected Coplans to John Irwin, who wanted to start a magazine. Coplans convinced Irwin that the West Coast needed an art publication: one that gave voice to art that was important, but had not yet received critical attention. He further suggested that it should be published in square format so that both vertical and horizontal images would be viewed equally, thus giving birth to ArtForum's iconic shape—and to the successful foundation of ArtForum itself. Coplans was a regular writer for the magazine. His perspective on art writing was anti-elitist, using popular appeal and excitement over new work to “stimulate debate and awareness” especially for West Coast artists. Finding himself conflicted between his painting and writing careers, he chose the latter, devoting the next twenty years of his life to the magazine, curatorial pursuits, and a career as a museum director. It was not until 1981, at the age of 62, that he returned to his career as an artist. Artistic practice \\"Frieze, No. 2, Four Panels, 1994\\" by John Coplans, in the collection of The Whitney Museum of American Art and the Tate Modern. Coplans is known for his series of black and white self-portraits which are a frank study of the naked, aging body. He photographed his body from the base of his foot to the wrinkles on his hand. As he never photographed his face, his images are not focused on a specific man nor identity. In 1980, during his one-year appointment as head of the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, Coplans first began experimenting with photography. Here he took his initial nude photographs with a timer, but would not return to the idea until 1984, when he began a serious exploration into the self portraits with the help of an assistant. The poses were inspired by an intuitive connection to a pre-conscious, pre-lingual awareness of the body. “I don’t know how it happens, but when I pose for one of these photographs, I become immersed in the past...I am somewhere else, another person, or a woman in another life. At times, I’m in my youth.” His technique for making the photographs involved use of Polaroid positive/negative 4x5 film, so that he could quickly see the result of the poses and make immediate adjustments. He later used a video camera connected to a television monitor to see the back of the 4x5 camera for an even more immediate mirror effect. Although this technique deepened his control and accuracy, it is of note that he claimed to possess a sense of pre-determined clarity about the poses. His photographs ultimately question the taboo of age through the provocative and direct style of addressing his body. Said Coplans: “I have the feeling that I’m alive, I have a body. I’m seventy years old, and generally the bodies of seventy-year old men look somewhat like my body. It's a neglected subject matter...So, I’m using my body and saying, even though it's a seventy year old body, I can make it interesting. This keeps me alive and gives me vitality. It's a kind of process of energizing myself by my belief that the classical tradition of art that we’ve inherited from the Greeks is a load of bullshit.”  Exhibitions  His major one-person exhibitions include: the Art Institute of Chicago (1981, 1989), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1988), the Museum of Modern Art, NY (1988), Boymans-van Beuningan, Rotterdam (1990), the Fundacio Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon (1990), the Centre George Pompidou, Paris (1994), Ludwig Forum, Aachen (1995), P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, NY (1997), Paco dasArtes, São Paulo (1998), Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh (1999), Malmö Konsthall, Sweden (1999). Artforum Coplans had a long affiliation with ArtForum as one of its founding members (1962), a contributing critic, and chief editor (1971-1976). Along with fellow founding member John Irwin he followed the magazine to Los Angeles and, in 1967, to its permanent home in New York. In June 1971, he replaced Philip Leider as chief editor (first announced on the magazine's masthead in January 1972). He subsequently presided over the magazine's tumultuous years, which saw the core editorial group of the mid- to late 1960s break apart into a handful of factions; the majority fo the group had left the magazine by the end of the 1970s. Coplans's reign at Artforum was considered a time of editorial catholicity, reflecting a moment of expanding media, practices, and modes of engagement within contemporary art. He was dismissed, along with his managing editor Max Kozloff, by the magazine's publisher Charles Cowles in December 1976. Curator and museum director From 1965 to 1967 Coplans was director of the Art Gallery of the University of California at Irvine. As senior curator at the Pasadena Art Museum (1967 – 1970), Coplans was among the earliest champions of Pop Art and a vociferously sympathetic critic of the work of Roy Lichtenstein and especially Andy Warhol. Coplans began a series of exhibitions in a small gallery in the old Pasadena Art Museum which included West Coast artists Dewain Valentine, Doug Wheeler, James Turrell, Robert Irwin, Wayne Thiebaud, and Judy Chicago. In many of these cases, such as with Lichtenstein, it was their crucial first exhibition. Many of the catalogue essays that accompanied these exhibitions were also published in ArtForum, bringing critical attention of these West Coast artists to a New York audience. In 1968, Coplans became Acting Director of the Pasadena Art Museum and curated the \\"Serial Imagery\\" show. He resigned in 1970 and left California in 1971 to become the editor in chief of ArtForum in New York City. He did, however, curate another major Warhol exhibition as well as a Richard Serra show before his move to New York. He was director of the Akron Art Museum, Ohio beginning in February, 1978, and ending in December, 1979, when he left his position due to a dispute with the Museum's Board of Directors. During his leadership he brought many exhibitions to Akron from New York, helped the institution to focus on photography and art of the Nineteenth Century and thereafter. He led the Museum's efforts to raise $5 million and design a new art museum facility utiling the 1899 Post Office Building in downtown Akron. This brief period was also important as Coplans bought cameras, set up a dark room in his apartment, and actively began his photographic work, initially by mimicking photographers who he admired, such as Lee Friedlander, Jan Groover, and others. He moved back to New York City in February, 1980.  Publications  = Writings by Coplans = Coplans wrote critical essays on the work of such artists as Andy Warhol, Robert Smithson, Philip Guston, and Donald Judd, many of which are included in his anthology entitled Provocations (1996). Many of these texts were initially writings for exhibition catalogues of exhibitions he had curated, and were in turn published in ArtForum. Several of these essays, including an early writing on the work of artist Ed Ruscha from a 1965 Artforum article, have been translated to French: Ed Ruscha: Huit textes Vingt-trois entretiens (2011). Following his 1969 Guggenheim Fellowship, he published a monograph on the work of Ellsworth Kelly (1973). = Writings about Coplans and artist monographs = His artist monographs include A Body (2002) and A Self-Portrait: John Coplans 1984-1997 which was published in tandem with his solo exhibition by the same title at MoMA P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center in New York, 1997. The photographic work of John Coplans has been a focus of academic study and art criticism since he began his self-portraits in the 1980s. His challenge of the ageist norm and beauty standards in Western culture, as articulated through his photography, has been studied in books such as Christophe Blazer's The Century of the Body, James Hall's The Self Portrait: A Cultural History, Jules Sturm's Bodies We Fail: Productive Embodiments of Imperfection, Davis Melody's The Male Nude in Contemporary Photography, and many others.  Museum collections  The photographs of John Coplans are featured in over sixty museum collections all over the world. These collections include:  Awards and honors  *Guggenheim Fellowship *National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship (1981) *Distinguished Visiting Professor, American University of Cairo (1983) *Guggenheim Fellowship (1985) *National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship (1986) *Richard Koopman Distinguished Chair, University of Hartford (1991) *Officer de L’Orde de Arts et de Letters (2001)  Personal life  John Coplans had a daughter, Dr. Barbara Ann Rivers Coplans, born in East Africa by his first wife Betty Coplans (née Little) and a son, Joseph John Coplans born in California, USA with his third wife, Carolyn Coplans (née Teeter). His fourth wife was New York photographer Amanda Means, who is Trustee of the John Coplans Trust in Beacon, New York.

The title refers to the five-day span during which the album was recorded. An almost entirely acoustic recording, the album features original songs and covers of traditional folk songs in near equal number, and was produced by R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck. Along with the rest of the Uncle Tupelo back catalog, this album was re-released in 2003. Background In 1990, R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck attended an Uncle Tupelo concert at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia. Buck was particularly impressed with the band's rendition of the Louvin Brothers' \\"Great Atomic Power\\", and contacted the band after the show. Uncle Tupelo singers Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy exchanged their interests in bluegrass music with Buck, and decided to collaborate on an acoustic music project in the future.Kot 2004, p. 61 Two years later, alternative rock bands such as Nirvana broke into the mainstream. Farrar was irate about the pressure from the music industry to sound like the trend: > This should insulate us from that industry bullshit, people looking for the > next Nirvana. I don't think anybody is the next Nirvana, certainly not us. > People always talk about the next Beatles, the next Elvis. You can't predict > that stuff. Uncle Tupelo's frustrations with their record label Rockville Records grew when the label refused to pay the band's royalties for the sales of their first two albums. This resulted in a \\"nothing-to-lose context\\" for the recording of a third album. In what was a sharp contrast to the popular music styles at the time, Uncle Tupelo decided to record an album of folk songs.Kot 2004, p. 63 Recording Before the band began recording, drummer Mike Heidorn announced that he intended to leave the band for personal reasons. However, Heidorn wanted to work with Peter Buck, so he agreed to postpone his departure until after the March 16–20, 1992 recording sessions.Kot 2004, pp. 68–69 The band stayed at Peter Buck's house while in Athens, Georgia to record the album. Buck offered to host the band for free, so that the $13,500 budget allotted by Rockville could be spent to pay the fees of the recording studio and audio engineers David Barbe and John Keane. Buck encouraged the band to arrange a certain amount of material each night to keep the band on pace. Guitarist Brian Henneman also contributed and learned how to play mandolin—the same one that Buck used in R.E.M.'s hit \\"Losing My Religion\\"—and bouzouki for the album. The five-day span that the band spent in the recording studio was ultimately used as the title of the album. The album's content reflected folk themes juxtaposed with new material from Tweedy and Farrar. Several of the songs have Christian themes but were placed on the album to reflect the \\"madness and fear that would drive men to wish for such redemption\\". Jeff Tweedy's lyrics were strongly influenced by Nick Drake's 1972 album Pink Moon. Farrar's \\"Criminals\\" paraphrases a George H. W. Bush campaign speech and was considered by music journalist Greg Kot to be one of the band's \\"angriest songs\\". Farrar's rendition of Sarah Ogan's \\"Come All You Coal Miners\\" Last accessed January 11, 2008. (the title was shortened to \\"Coalminers\\" and the song listed as \\"traditional\\" on the album) lamented the harsh working conditions in the coal mining industry, but the choice was received poorly by some of the band's closest peers; according to singer Nick Sakes of Dazzling Killmen:Kot 2004, p. 64–65 > We could occasionally imitate Jay's singing and insert our own words: 'It > gets real hot working down at my mom's bookstore.' It was a little too much > to hear these songs about coal miners coming from regular dudes that worked > in record stores and bought SST Records and went to Black Flag shows. Three songs, the gospel tune \\"Warfare\\", the hymn \\"Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\" and the ballad \\"I Wish My Baby Was Born\\" were taken from High Atmosphere, a compilation of songs recorded by John Cohen in Virginia and North Carolina. Last accessed January 13, 2008 Along with Ogan's version of \\"Coalminers\\", the murder ballad \\"Lilli Schull\\" had previously been released on Oh My Little Darling, a compilation of Southeastern folk song types released on New World Records. Last accessed January 13, 2008 In a 2002 interview with Anthony DeCurtis, Tweedy noted that, of all of the songs that Uncle Tupelo recorded throughout their career, \\"Sandusky\\" holds a special place for him: > \\"Sandusky\\" is probably the track that I'm most proud of.

Release and reception March 16–20, 1992 sold more copies than their first two albums, No Depression and Still Feel Gone, combined. Uncle Tupelo embarked on a tour of small clubs to promote the album. However, the band resisted performing material from March, since many of the venues attracted a punk rock audience; Tweedy thought \\"it would have been suicide\\" if Uncle Tupelo performed acoustic songs. The album generated mostly positive reviews. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic called the album \\"a brilliant resurrection of a bygone era of American folk artistry\\". Bill Wyman of Entertainment Weekly remarked that it was \\"a moving and sincere New Depression manifesto\\". March was re-issued in 2003 through Legacy Records. The re-release contained five bonus tracks: acoustic demos of \\"Grindstone\\" and The Stooges' \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\", a live version of \\"Moonshiner\\", the previously unreleased \\"Take My Word\\", and a version of the theme song from The Waltons. Reviews for the re-issue were also mostly positive. Pitchfork writer William Bowers called March Uncle Tupelo's best album \\"by far\\", claiming \\"The acoustic guitar has rarely sounded better than it does here.\\" However, Bowers also criticized the addition of the bonus tracks.

It was founded in 1981 by Greg Wanless and a group of local actors and graduates from Queen's University including Timm Hughes, Joan Gardiner, Mo Bock, and Kathryn Mackay. Artistic Director Wanless and Assistant Artistic Director Mackay retired at the end of the 2012 season. The current Artistic Director is Brett Christopher, and the Associate Artistic Director is Sophia Fabiilli. Thousand Islands Playhouse operates two theatres, the former Gananoque Canoe Club building as the 348-seat Springer Theatre in which musicals and larger plays are performed, and a black-box theatre, the 140-seat Firehall Theatre in which smaller, experimental plays are produced. The Thousand Islands Playhouse's programming also includes a Playwrights’ Unit with workshop productions for the public, a touring show performed by their Young Company, and the Studio ‘S’ Classical Music Series. The company has also recently renovated a new premier production facility. Playwrights’ Unit The Playwrights’ Unit is a year-long residency program to nurture promising playwrights. The selected writers create new plays while having the Playhouse audience and resources of both the Springer Theatre and Firehall Theatre in mind. During the month of December, the Playhouse holds full day workshops during the PlayReading series; a series of free-public reading on the playwrights’ work. =2015 Playwrights’ Unit= Bed and Breakfast was written in the 2014 Playwrights’ Unit and is being presented in the company’s 2015 season. It is about two men who escape the big city life and move to a small town in Ontario seeking to call it home. Young Company Beginning in mid- April until the end of June, The Young Company introduces children to the magic of theatre with a travelling show, incorporating reading, singing, storytelling and dance. The Young Company has been bringing high-calibre acting to the Thousand Islands Playhouse since 1997, performing their shows across Eastern Ontario to school-aged children, as well as in parks, libraries, and at special events. They employ a troupe of young professionals providing them with professionally led-workshops and master classes. The graduates have gone on to take well-earned places in the profession. Studio ‘S’ Music Series Throughout the summer on select Monday evenings, the Thousand Islands Playhouse presents the popular Studio ‘S’ series, an intimate concert and conversation series with world-renowned classical musicians, hosted by Eric Friesen. Each season features four new performers in the intimate 348 seat Springer Theatre. Production Facility In May 2014, the Thousand Islands Playhouse began to renovate a 10,395 square foot warehouse into Eastern Ontario’s premier production facility. The facility allows plenty of room to build and store many things such as sets, costumes, props and a space for the actors to rehearse plays and musicals. This project was incorporated with a sprung floor, sound proofed rooms and rack systems for the Playhouse’s inventory of props and costumes that finished on March 31, 2015.\\"Workshops focus on two winning plays\\".

History =Origins of the clan= Dean Castle, previously known as Kilmarnock Castle, ancient stronghold of the chiefs of Clan Boyd The name Boyd is said to be descriptive, being derived from the Scottish Gaelic buidh which means fair or yellow. The progenitor is said to have been Robert, son of Simon and nephew of Walter fitz Alan, the first High Steward of Scotland. This theory however is challenged by genealogist, William Anderson, who points out that most of the friends and dependents of the High Stewards were of Norman origin and it is therefore unlikely that they would use a Celtic nickname for one of their own family. Anderson believed the name to be of either Norman or Saxon origin. The historian, George Fraser Black, asserts that the first Boyds were vassals of a Norman family, the de Morvilles, for their lands around Largs and Irvine.Black, George Fraser. (1946). The surnames of Scotland, their origin meaning and history. p. 94. Black also states that the surname Boyd may be derived from the Scottish Gaelic for the Isle of Bute which is Bòd. Black gives an example of the Marquess of Bute in Scottish Gaelic being Morair Bhoid. Modern sources give the Isle of Bute in Scottish Gaelic as Eilean Bhòid.Visit Bute visitbute.com. Retrieved August 14, 2015. In 1205 Robert de Boyd (or Robertus de Boyd) witnessed a contract between the Lord of Eglinton and the burgh of Irvine. Robert de Boyte is listed on the Ragman Rolls, giving homage to Edward I of England in 1296. =Wars of Scottish Independence= In 1306 Duncan Boyd was executed for supporting the cause of Scottish Independence. Also during the Wars of Scottish Independence, Sir Robert Boyd was a strong supporter of King Robert the Bruce and was even one of the commanders at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. He was rewarded for his gallantry, with lands that had been confiscated off the Balliols, including Kilmarnock, Bodington and other substantial lands in Ayrshire. =15th century and clan conflicts= Sir Thomas Boyd, 8th chief of Clan Boyd is recorded as having killed Sir Alan Stewart of Darnley in a feud that was in its third year.Boyd, William. P. (1912). History of the Boyd Family and Descendants. pp. 48 - 49. Boyd himself was killed in revenge by Alexander Stewart, brother of Alan, on 9 July 1439 at Craignaucht Hill in the parish of Dunlop. Stewart had set upon Boyd in open battle in which Boyd was killed along with many men on either side. Boyd's force consisted of only 100 men, where as Stewart's force consisted of three detachments each of seventy men.Robertson, William. (1889). Historical Tales and Legends of Ayrshire. Glasgow : T. D. Morison. pp. 295-305. Boyd's scout only saw one of the Stewart detachments and so the Boyds were expecting their enemy to be inferior in number. However the battle was joined by the other two Stewart detachments which meant that the Boyds were outnumbered by more than two to one. The battle was so fierce that both sides would retire only to re- counter again at the sound of a trumpet. The battle eventually went in favour of the Stewarts of Darnley, however it did not end the feud as another of the Stewarts was later killed in revenge by the Boyds in the town of Dumbarton. =15th century and royal relations= The chief of the clan was raised to the peerage under the title Lord Boyd of Kilmarnock by James II of Scotland. On the death of that king, Robert Boyd, 1st Lord Boyd was appointed as one of the regents to the young James III of Scotland. Boyd's younger brother was appointed as the military tutor to the new king. Lord Boyd was also later appointed as Great Chamberlain while his son, Thomas, was married to Princess Mary, the king's sister and was given the title Earl of Arran. The family's success naturally brought them powerful enemies and those opposed to the Boyds began conspiring against them. In 1469 Lord Boyd along with his son, Thomas, and his brother, Alexander were summoned to appear before the king and Parliament to answer charges made against them. Lord Boyd realizing that he faced death escaped to England, while his brother Alexander was executed. His son, Thomas, the Earl of Arran, had been on state business abroad and upon learning of the reversal of his family's fortunes accepted his exile but was well received in royal courts throughout Europe. James Boyd, 2nd Lord Boyd, 11th chief of the clan, was killed in a feud with Hugh Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Eglinton in 1484.Boyd, William. P. (1912). History of the Boyd Family and Descendants. pp. 51 - 52. He was succeeded by his uncle, Alexander Boyd, 3rd Lord Boyd, 12th chief, who was a favourite of James IV of Scotland who made him Bailie and Chamberlain of Kilmarnock. =16th century= Alexander's son was Robert Boyd, 4th Lord Boyd who according to historian William Boyd had the estates and honours of Lord Boyd restored to him in 1536 by James V of Scotland. Although according to the Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia the estates and honours were restored during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. Robert had two children, Robert and Margaret. Margaret married Neil Montgomery of Lainshaw, but the connection between the two families was not friendly and her father Robert Boyd, along with Mowat of Busbie, assassinated Neil Montgomery at Irvine in 1547 in revenge for the death of his cousin, James Boyd, in 1484. The Boyd family were restored to royal favour when Robert Boyd, a descendant of the first Lord Boyd received confirmation of all the family's estates and honours from Mary, Queen of Scots. After the Queen's escape from Lochleven Castle, Lord Boyd was one of the first to join her and fought for her at the Battle of Langside. He later made many visits to her when she was held captive in England. He died in 1590. =17th century and Civil War= During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms the Clan Boyd supported the royalist cause. They were rewarded after the Restoration (1660) when William, Lord Boyd was created Earl of Kilmarnock. =18th century and Jacobite risings= The third earl opposed the Jacobite rising of 1715 and commanded a regiment of Ayrshire volunteers for the government. However his son, the fourth earl, did support the Jacobite rising of 1745 and fought for Charles Edward Stuart at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, after he had made him a member of the Privy Council with the rank of general. Boyd was captured at the Battle of Culloden and taken to the Tower of London. He was beheaded on Tower Hill on 18 August 1746. All of the Boyd titles were then forfeited, however his eldest son succeeded through his mother to the title of Earl of Erroll and changed his surname to Hay. (See: James Hay, 15th Earl of Erroll). =Modern history= The 22nd Earl of Errol died in Kenya in 1941. His daughter was entitled to succeed in the earldom of Erroll and the chiefship of the Clan Hay but was excluded from the barony of Kilmarnock which could only pass to males. Consequently the brother of the 22nd Earl resumed the surname of Boyd and succeeded to the barony of Kilmarnock. Clan Chief Alastair Boyd, 7th Baron Kilmarnock and Chief of Clan Boyd, died 19 March 2009. obituaries updated on 6:59PM GMT 20 Mar 2009, in The Daily Telegraph The barony and the chiefship pass to his brother Dr Robin Boyd, who has not yet claimed either title. =Chiefly arms= Quarterly, 1st Azure a fess chequy Argent and Gules (for Boyd), 2nd Argent three inescutcheons Gules (for Hay), 3rd Argent three gillyflowers Gules within a double tressure flory counter flory Vert (for Livingston), 4th Sable a bend between six billets Or (for Callendar). =Crest badge= The crest badge used by members of House of Boyd contains the motto CONFIDO (\\"I trust\\"). The blazon of the crest is A dexter hand erect in pale having the outer fingers bowed inwards. The crest badge is the heraldic property of the chief, though any member of the clan may wear this badge to show allegiance to the chief and family.

It made its public debut in November 2002 when a development aircraft was displayed at the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) convention. As of March 2007 orders totaled more than 130 aircraft, with deliveries scheduled to begin in June 2008. On December 2, 2005 NetJets signed an order for 50 of the new aircraft, the largest single commercial order in the history of Raytheon Aircraft. The Hawker 4000 is being certified to FAA FAR Part 25 standards, which places a five-year time limit on certification of a new transport category aircraft. The 4000 completed Function and Reliability Tests on May 25, 2006. During September 2005, a prototype underwent testing at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. However, since the Part 25 five-year window expired May 31, 2006, the company filed an extension request to head off the possibility that the certification program would need to restart from the beginning. On November 21, 2006, the company announced that the 4000 had received its FAA type certification. In May 2008, BJETS completed an order for ten Hawker 4000 business jets from Hawker Beechcraft Corporation. The contract value including all options exercised was said to be in excess of $330 million. The deal was announced at EBACE on May 20, 2008. and Following the BJETS order, Hawker Beechcraft delivered its Hawker 4000 super-midsized business jet to customer Jack P. DeBoer during a special ceremony at the company's Customer Delivery Center in Wichita, Kan. At the time, the Hawker 4000 was the first aircraft in its class to be based on its composite construction. The Hawker 4000 received its certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China in December 2009. In February 2010, Hawker Beechcraft delivered its first Hawker 4000 to a customer in mainland China. As of May 2013, Hawker-Beechcraft is offering its jet division, including the Hawker 4000 project, for sale.

University of Waterloo The University of Waterloo has four affiliated institutions, collectively referred to as the \\"university colleges\\" or \\"church colleges\\": Conrad Grebel University College, a college owned by the Mennonite Church Eastern Canada that offers programs in peace and conflict studies, music, and Mennonite studies; Renison University College, a public college affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada that offers programs in social development studies, social work, East Asian studies, and languages; St. Jerome's University, a public Roman Catholic liberal arts university established in 1865; and St. Paul's University College, a public college formerly affiliated with the United Church of Canada that offers programs on social justice and environmental issues. All students can take courses offered by the university and any of the colleges, degrees bear the university's name and seal, and admission to college residences is not restricted based on religious beliefs. University of Windsor The University of Windsor has three affiliated institutions: Assumption University, a Roman Catholic university offering graduate degree programs in religious subjects; Canterbury College, a public liberal arts college affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada; and Iona College, a public liberal arts college formerly affiliated with the United Church of Canada. University of Western Ontario The University of Western Ontario has three affiliate colleges: Huron University College, a public liberal arts college established in 1863 and affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada ; Brescia University College, a public Roman Catholic women's college established in 1919 by the Ursulines; and King's University College, a public Roman Catholic co-educational college established in 1954 that offers programs in liberal arts, business, social justice, and theology (through an affiliation with St. Peter's Seminary). UWO previously had affiliation agreements with other institutions, including Alma College, Assumption University and Wilfrid Laurier University. = India = Several thousand schools affiliated with larger universities educate a large number of undergraduates in India. = Pakistan = Similar arrangements exist between universities and affiliated colleges in Pakistan.The list of affiliated colleges recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan can be found here. =United Kingdom= Historically, affiliated colleges have existed at some universities in the UK. These include: University of Cambridge The University of Cambridge affiliated university colleges in the UK from the late 19th century. Students who had completed two years at these institutions were permitted to reduce the time spent getting an undergraduate degree at Cambridge by a year. The affiliated colleges in 1914 were: * St David's College, Lampeter * University College of Wales, Aberystwyth * University College, Nottingham * St Edmund's College, Old Hall, Ware * Hartley University College, Southampton * University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, Cardiff * Royal Albert Memorial University College, Exeter Durham University Durham University has had various forms of affiliated college from the late 19th century, including \\"affiliated colleges\\" where students could study for Durham degrees (for which provision still exists in the statutes as of 2020, although without any institutions having this status) and \\"associated theological colleges\\" where students could study for the Durham License in Theology and could count the three years spent on that course against two years on the BA course at Durham. The affiliated colleges were: * Sunderland Technical College * Codrington College, Barbados * Fourah Bay College, Sierra Leone The associated theological colleges included at various times: * St Aidan's College, Birkenhead * St Andrew's College, Oyo, Nigeria * St Augustine's College, Canterbury * The Bible Churchmen's Missionary College, Clifton * Burgh Missionary College * Chichester Theological College * Cumbrae Theological College * Dorchester Missionary College * Edinburgh Theological College * Gloucester Theological College * Highbury College, London * Church Missionary Society College, Islington * Jamaica Theological College * St John's (Armidale, NSW) * Lichfield Theological College * Lincoln Theological College * Moore Theological College (Sydney) * Queen's College (St John's, Newfoundland) * Salisbury Theological College * Selwyn College (Dunedin) * Truro Theological College * St Boniface Missionary College, Warminster * Bishop Wilson Theological College, Isle of Man * The Theological Department of King's College London * The Theological Department of Queen's College, Birmingham University of London As first created in 1836, the University of London was an examining board for its affiliated colleges (initially only University College London and King's College London, often referred to as the 'founding colleges'), including a number of Catholic institutions and dissenting academies whose students could not take degrees at Oxford, Cambridge or Durham. This system continued until 1858, when University of London examinations were thrown open to all students with the establishment of the external degree system. The University of London later became a federal university in 1900. By 1858, the following institutions (as they are given in the 1858 charter) had been recognised as affiliated colleges: * University College London * King's College London * Queen's College Belfast * Queen's College Galway * Queen's College Cork * St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw * Stonyhurst College * Manchester New College * St Mary's College, Oscott * St Patrick's College, Carlow * St Edmund's College, near Ware * Spring Hill College, Moseley, near Birmingham * The College, Regents Park (late Stepney College) * College of St Gregory the Great, Downside, near Bath * Countess of Huntingdon's College at Cheshunt * The Baptist College at Bristol * Airedale College, Undercliffe, near Bradford * Protestant Dissenters' College at Rotherham * Presbyterian College at Carmarthen * St Kyran's College, Kilkenny * Huddersfield College * Lancashire Independent College * Wesley College near Sheffield * Queen's College, Birmingham * Wesleyan Collegiate Institution, Taunton * Western College, Plymouth * West of England Dissenters' Proprietary School, Taunton * St Patrick's College, Thurles * New College, London * Owen's College, Manchester * Bedford Grammar Schools * Brecon Independent College * Horton College, Bradford, Yorkshire * Hackney Theological Seminary * Trevecca College, Brecon * Springfield College, Ennis * Bishop Stortford Collegiate School * Working Men's College, London * Queen's College, Liverpool University of Oxford The University of Oxford affiliated university colleges in the UK from the late 19th century.

The affiliated colleges in 1906 were: * St David's College, Lampeter * University College, Nottingham * Firth College, Sheffield * Reading College, Reading * Hartley University College, Southampton =United States=  Columbia University  In the United States, Columbia University is associated in various ways with several affiliated schools. Most notably, Barnard College is legally and financially separate from Columbia but its students have access to the instruction and facilities of Columbia. A similar arrangement exists with Teachers College, which since its affiliation with Columbia has served as the University's Faculty and Department of Education. Columbia has more limited cooperative arrangements and joint programs and degrees with two nearby independent institutions: Union Theological Seminary and Jewish Theological Seminary.  Harvard University  Radcliffe College's relationship to Harvard University resembled that of Barnard to Columbia until Radcliffe was completely merged into Harvard in 1999.  Yale University  The Yale Divinity School, part of Yale University, is associated with two affiliated schools, Berkeley Divinity School and the Andover-Newton Seminary. Both Berkeley (from 1854 until 1971) and Andover-Newton (from 1807 to 2017) were once entirely independent seminaries and they still maintain their own Boards of Trustees and distinctive missions. Berkeley also still awards its own diplomas and certificates in Anglican ministry. But the students of both affiliated schools are also enrolled at, and receive degrees from, the Yale Divinity School and both their students and their faculty are fully integrated into the life of the larger institution.  University of California  The University of California, Hastings College of the Law is affiliated, as its name suggests, with the University of California, but it is not directly governed by the Regents of the University of California.

The station is owned by KZIA, Inc., which also owns KZIA (102.9 FM). It is Cedar Rapids' second-oldest radio station, after WMT. KGYM does not broadcast a digital HD signal on its AM frequency of 1600 kHz, but it can be heard in HD on KZIA-HD3 and KZIA-HD4.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=9718 History KGYM signed on as KCRG on December 20, 1947, under the ownership of the Cedar Rapids Gazette Company (later known as Gazette Communications). The Gazette Company had launched Cedar Rapids' first FM station, KCRK-FM 96.1, a month earlier and had applied for a construction permit for a television station on channel 9 that year. (KCRK-FM signed off in 1954 as FM radio was still in its infancy and the station proved to be unprofitable.) In 1953 the Gazette Company consolidated its interests with the Cedar Rapids Television Company, another group interested in the channel 9 license, and in October 1953 the call letters of the radio and television stations were changed to KCRI. After the Gazette Company bought out the Cedar Rapids Television Company's stock on August 27, 1954, the KCRG call letters were restored to both the AM and TV stations. During the early 1990s KCRG was a country music station, and it later adopted a news/talk format. By 2000 the station had moved to its current sports talk format but continued to simulcast KCRG-TV's newscasts and ABC's World News Tonight for radio listeners. KCRG radio adopted the nickname \\"The Zone\\" in 2003. On July 10, 2006, Gazette Communications announced that KCRG was being sold to owners of another local broadcaster, KZIA FM 102.9, subject to FCC approval. The sale was finalized on October 31, 2006, and the call letters were changed to KGYM as a result of the sale. After the acquisition, KGYM ended its simulcasting of KCRG-TV's newscasts, and KGYM's studios moved from downtown Cedar Rapids to KZIA's studios on the city's southwest side. Programming KGYM currently broadcasts ESPN Radio programming along with Iowa State University sports, college basketball and the NFL from Westwood One, the IndyCar Series, Minnesota Twins baseball on 107.5 FM and area high school football and basketball games. It also carried Cedar Rapids Kernels games before sharing rights with KMRY, another Cedar Rapids radio station, during the 2006 season. Kernels games moved exclusively to KMRY starting in 2007. Local talk shows include The Gym Class hosted by KGYM sports director Scott Unash and former Cedar Rapids Gazette sports editor Mark Dukes and The Todd Brommelkamp Show with Alex Kuhn hosted by Voice of the Hawkeyes magazine editor Todd Brommelkamp and St. Louis native Alex Kuhn.

He also worked on English. He was a prolific writer, penning over 20 novels, 30 collections of short stories and scores of radio plays in Urdu, and later, after partition of the country, took to writing in Hindi as well. He also wrote screen-plays for Bollywood movies to supplement his meagre income as an author of satirical stories. Krishan Chander's novels (including the classic : Ek Gadhe Ki Sarguzasht, trans. Autobiography of a Donkey) have been translated into over 16 Indian languages and some foreign languages, including English. His short story \\"Annadata\\" (trans: The Giver of Grain – an obsequious appellation used by Indian peasants for their feudal land-owners), was made into the film Dharti Ke Lal (1946) by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas – which led to his being offered work regularly as a screenwriter by Bollywood, including such populist hits as Mamta (1966) and Sharafat (1970). He wrote his film scripts in Urdu. Early life and education Chander was born in Bharatpur, Rajasthan where his father worked as a doctor. The family originally belonged to Wazirabad District Gujranwala, of undivided Punjab, British India. Chander spent his childhood in Poonch, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, where his father worked as the physician of Maharaja Poonch. His novel Shakast (Defeat) is related to Kashmir's partition. Mitti Ke Sanam one of his most popular novel is about the childhood memories of a young boy who lived with his parents in Kashmir. His another memorable novel is \\"Gaddar\\", which is about the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947. In this novel, he brilliantly picturised the sufferings of the people during that time through a selfish young man's feelings, who himself was a gaddar (betrayer). His short stories are the stories of Kashmiri villages, as well as those of displaced expatriates and rootless urban man. He used Pahari (dialect of people living in Poonch) words while writing in Urdu. In the 1930s he studied at Forman Christian College and edited the English section of the college house magazine, and was at that time interested in English writings. As the then editor of the Urdu section of the magazine, Mehr Lal Soni Zia Fatehabadi was instrumental to his career in having got published, in the year 1932, Chander's first Urdu short story, \\"Sadhu\\". Career His literary masterpieces on the Bengal famine and the savagery and barbarism that took place at the time of the partition of India in 1947 are some of the finest specimens of modern Urdu literature, but at other times too he continued relentlessly to critique the abuse of power, poverty and the suffering of the wretched of the earth; but above all he never stopped protesting casteism, fanaticism, communal violence and terror. He was a humanist and a cosmopolitan.

As the campaigning season of 627 ended, Heraclius gathered his heterogeneous army of Göktürks and Byzantines, and invaded the Persian heartland at the beginning of September. The news threw Khosrau into a panic. After fifteen years of war, his army was exhausted and his two foremost generals were not available; Shahin was dead and Shahrbaraz was away in Egypt, fearing that Khosrau wanted him dead. Consequently, Khosrau gathered an army and appointed as its commander Rhahzadh, a warlike and brave nobleman. Rhahzadh moved to cut off Heraclius and prevent him from reaching Ctesiphon, the Persian capital. Heraclius continued burning and pillaging as he went, Rhahzadh following Heraclius, bidding his time until he was ready to meet the Romans. Finally Heraclius crossed the Great Zab River and set up camp preventing Rhahzadh from crossing by the same bridge without forcing battle.Kaegi (2003), pp. 159–160 Instead he moved down and forded further downstream. When Heraclius heard of this he detached part of his army under Baanes to harass Rhahzadh. In the ensuing skirmish the Romans killed and captured many Persians, including Rhahzadh's personal aide. From him Heraclius learned that Rhahzadh was awaiting some 3000 reinforcements. Heraclius became concerned when he heard of this: his army was severely depleted by the desertion of the Turkic contingent and was concerned that Rhahzadh's reinforcements could tip the scale.Kaegi (2003), p. 160 So on 12 December 627, near Nineveh, Heraclius drew up his army on a plain and waited for Rhahzadh. Rhahzadh saw this and moved to meet the Byzantines. He drew up his army in three divisions similar to phalanxes, and advanced towards Heraclius.Kaegi (2003), pp. 161–162 At the height of the battle Rhahzadh suddenly challenged Heraclius to single combat with the hope of forcing the Romans to flee. Heraclius accepted the challenge and spurred his horse forward and with a single blow struck off Rhahzadh's head, taking from the dead Persian his shield of 120 gold plates and gold breastplate as trophies. With Rhahzadh's death perished the Persians' hopes of victory: seeing their brave commander and many other high-ranking officers being slain by Heraclius and his household troops, the Persian troops lost heart and were slaughtered suffering around 6,000 casualties.

It replaced the earlier cow- amulet. Symbolism Hypocephali symbolized the Eye of Ra (Eye of Horus), which represents the sun deity. The scenes portrayed on them relate to Egyptian ideas of resurrection and life after death, connecting them with the Osirian myth.Alfred Wiedemann, Religion of the Ancient Egyptians, 2001, p.306 To the ancient Egyptians the daily setting and rising of the sun was a symbol of death and rebirth. The hypocephalus represented all that the sun encircles -- the world of the living, over which it passed during the day, was depicted in the upper half, and that of the dead, which it crossed during the night, in the lower portion. Hypocephali first appeared during the Egyptian Saite Dynasty (663-525 B.C.) and their use continued for centuries. Chapter 162 of the Book of the Dead version of that period contain directions for the making and use of hypocephali.E. A.

Sometimes the term is used in exclusive reference to Mexico & Guatemala. After the petroleum boom previous to the government of Mexican president José López Portillo (from 1976 to 1982), the Mexican government began to rely heavily on export barrels to support the financial needs in the country. These exports were mainly directed towards the United States, mainly due to the petroleum crisis of 1973, taking advantage of the high prices these barrels garnered. When the market finally settled, thus reducing the high prices per barrel, the financial stability of the country was endangered. Diversification of income would have prevented the problem, but due to the inability of other production sectors to make up for the reduced profit, Mexico had to inflate the currency to by then historic levels. The Mexican peso would then be devaluated by almost 500%. Given these circumstances, López Portillo nationalized all financial institutions in 1982, during his last public address to the nation by saying: \\"Defenderé el peso como un perro\\" (\\"I'll defend the peso like a dog\\"). During the next period, president Miguel de la Madrid tried to bring back foreign investment and new trade agreements, culminating with Mexico's admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on January 1986 and also his proposed \\"Economic Solidarity Pact\\" in 1987, which finally put inflation under control, which averaged 100% until that time.

Malay edition. Arabic edition. Faza'il-e-A'maal (, [Virtues of deeds]), originally titled Tablighi Nisab (, [Curriculum for Tabligh]), is a religious text composed mainly of treatises by the Indian hadith scholar Muhammad Zakariya Kandhlawi . The book is written in simple and lucid Urdu and is a collection of pious and edifying tales, based mostly on inspirational hadith traditions and anecdotes. Tablighi Jamaat promote the book to the non- Arab communities, while to Arabic speaking communities they suggest reading Riyad as-Salihin by Yahya Nawawi instead. The book has been translated into several languages, including: Arabic, French, and Malay.  History  In the preface of the book is mentioned that, Muhammad Zakariyya Kandhlawi wrote, \\"Hikayat-e-Sahaba\\" at the request of Abdul Qadir Raipuri, \\"Fazail-e-Quran\\" (Virtues of Quran) at the request of Muhammad Yasin Niginwi, \\"Fazail-e-Namaz\\", \\"Fazail-e-Zikr\\", \\"Fazail-e-Tableegh\\" and \\"Fazail-e-Ramadan\\" at the request of his uncle Muhammad Ilyas Kandhlawi. \\"Fazail-e-Sadaqat\\" and \\"Fazail-e-Hajj\\" was written at the request of Muhammad Yusuf Kandhlawi. In about 1955 a collection of works by Muhammad Zakariya was published in two volumes under the title Tablighi Nisab. A single volume version was published in 1958. The first English translation was published in 1960. A revised English edition was published by Kutub Khana Faydi in Lahore in 1980. Another English translation of the book was published in 1984 by Waterval Islamic Institute, Johansberg and later become immensely popular in South Africa. In 1985, the translations from the second edition were published in Delhi as Teachings of Islam. The English edition published in Delhi in 1986 contained both parts one and two; part two was ommited from later versions. Kutub Khana Faydi published the third revised English edition of the book in 1985 as Faza\`il A\`maal. The 1987 Karachi edition was a reprint of the third edition, and was reprinted in England and South Africa. A simple English edition was published in 1995. The 1985 Kutub Khana Faydi edition has been published in French translation. The English and French translations retain the madrasa idioms, and the Uttar Pradesh town background and world-view of the original Urdu books.  Overview  Some new Urdu editions also add: *Muslim Degeneration and its Only Remedy (1939) (, ) by Ihtishamul Hasan Kandhlawi. English editions include writings such as: *Six Fundamentals (translation of Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri's Chhe Baten (, [Six points])), *A Call to Muslims (translation of a 1944 speech by Muhammad Ilyas Kandhlawi), and *Muslim Degeneration and its Only Remedy (1939) (translation of Ihtishamul Hasan Kandhlawi's Musalmānoṉ kī maujūdah pastī kā wāḥid ‘ilāj). Some editions of Faza'il-e-A'mal do not contain: *Zakariya's Virtues of durood (1965) (, ) This was omitted because some Deobandi scholars in Pakistan were against its inclusion.  Contents  The book has two parts (or volumes): *Part one Stories of sahabah (). This consists of stories of Mohammad's companions, depicting them as role models for Muslims. (272 pages) Statements regarding the number of pages in various parts of Fazail-e-Amaal refer to the 1987 Karachi edition. Virtues of the holy qur'aan (). Forty hadith on the merits of the Quran. (120 pages) Virtues of salaat (). Hadith on the merits of prayer. (112 pages) Virtues of zikr (). Quranic verses and hadith on the merits of phrases known as kalima that are used to remember God. (265 pages) Virtues of tabligh (). The significance of preaching the faith. (48 pages) Virtues of ramadan (). The merits and significance of ramadan, the month of fasting.

The text consists of selected verses of the Qur'an, Hadiths, commentary thereon, and other material. The book is a compilation of different previous books written by same author. It has been translated into English, Arabic, Persian, Bengali, and many other languages. Initially it was popular in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and among South Asian immigrants in the United States or UK but now the popularity is exponentially grown up in recent years all over the Europe, Asia Pacific, African and Latin American countries. It is also used by the Tablighi Jamaat for taalim (teaching) purposes.  Criticism  The book has been claimed to be based mostly on historically suspect and non-authentic hadith traditions and anecdotes. The Ahl al-Hadith and Salafi communities allege that this Islamic book contains references to many baseless hadiths. So they continue to preach not to read the book. The Salafi scholar Salih Al- Munajjid said, \\"the scholars continue to warn against the book Tableeghi Nisaab, otherwise known as Fadaa’il al-A‘maal. It is not permissible for any Muslim to read it; rather they should focus on the books of the saheeh Sunnah, books whose authors follow the path of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah. As for books that contain myths and lies, they should not have any place in the heart or mind of the Muslim.\\" Hammood at-Tuwaijri wrote that the Tabligh Jamaat \\"pay a great deal of attention to this book, which they respect as Ahl as-Sunnah respect as-Saheehayn and other books of hadeeth. The Tableeghis have made this book the most important reference work for the Indians and other non-Arabs who follow them. It contains a great deal of matters of shirk, innovation (bid'ah), myths, and fabricated (mawdoo‘) and weak (da‘eef) hadeeths. In fact it is a book of evil, misguidance and confusion (fitnah).\\" Quoted in Shams ad-Deen al-Afghaani wrote, \\"The leading imams of the Deobandis have books which are venerated by the Deobandis, but they are filled with the myths of grave-worshippers and Sufi idolatry, such as – and he mentioned a number of books, including Tableeghi Nisaab, i.e., Nisaab at- Tableegh, and Manhaj at-Tableegh. These Deobandis did not openly disavow these books or warn against them, and they did not put a stop to the printing and sale of these books. The markets of India and Pakistan and elsewhere are full of them.\\" Quoted in It is said in , \\"In their gatherings in Arab countries they – i.e., Jamaa‘at at-Tableegh – focus on reading from Riyadh as-Saaliheen, but in non- Arab countries they focus on reading from Hayat as-Sahaabah and Tableeghi Nisaab; the latter book is full of myths and da‘eef (weak) hadeeths.\\" Quoted in  See also  * Dala'il al-Khayrat * Al-Muhannad ala al-Mufannad  References   External links  * Faza'il-e-A'maal in English * Faza'il- e-A'maal in French * Faza'il-e-A'maal in Arabic Category:Deobandi Category:Maturidi literature Category:Sunni literature Category:Sufi literature ","title":"Fazail-e-Amaal"},{"id":"3438215","text":"Aerial view of the Moses Rock Dike diatreme, San Juan County, Utah A diatreme, sometimes known as a maar-diatreme volcano, is a volcanic pipe formed by a gaseous explosion. When magma rises up through a crack in the Earth's crust and makes contact with a shallow body of ground water, rapid expansion of heated water vapor and volcanic gases can cause a series of explosions. A relatively shallow crater is left (known as a maar) and a rock-filled fracture (the actual diatreme) in the Earth's crust. Diatremes breach the Earth's surface and produce a steep inverted cone shape. The term diatreme has been applied more generally to any concave body of broken rock formed by explosive or hydrostatic forces, whether or not it is related to volcanism. The word comes from Greek δία (\\"through\\") and τρῆμα (\\"hole, aperture\\").  Global distribution  Maar-diatreme volcanoes are not uncommon, reported as the second most common type of volcanoes on continents and islands. Igneous intrusions cause the formation of a diatreme only in the specific setting where groundwater exists. This means most igneous intrusions do not produce diatremes. Examples of diatremes include the Blackfoot diatreme and Cross diatreme in British Columbia, Canada.  Economic importance  Diatreme formation is sometimes associated with kimberlite magma, which originates in the upper mantle. When a diatreme is formed due to a kimberlite intrusion, there is a possibility that diamonds may be brought up, because diamonds are formed in the upper mantle at depths of 150-200 kilometers. Kimberlite magmas can sometimes include chunks of diamond as xenoliths, making them economically significant. Diatremes are sometimes associated with deposition of economically significant mineral deposits.

The bridge was built by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission. The bridge is a multiple span dual roadway with a steel plate structure. The roadways are wide each and separated from each other by a concrete Jersey barrier. The facility opened to the public on December 16, 1953, at ceremonies attended by Governor of Pennsylvania John S. Fine and Governor of New Jersey Alfred E. Driscoll. The bridge carried US 611 (now Pennsylvania Route 611) for four miles (6 km) in New Jersey to a connection with Route 94. I-80 was routed onto the bridge in 1959. There is a pedestrian sidewalk on the south side of the New Jersey-bound section of the bridge, separated from motor vehicles with a concrete divider. The pedestrian walkway on the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge connects Pennsylvania's northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail with New Jersey's southern end. The Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area straddles both sides of the river near the bridge; Worthington State Forest is located along the bridge's New Jersey side.

It serves the Greater Milwaukee area. Mayfair Shopping Center was constructed from 1956 and completed in 1959 by the Hunzinger Construction Company. It has been expanded several times since it was first built. The mall contains 164 stores and the anchor stores are Macy's, Williams Sonoma, Crate & Barrel, Talbots, Barnes & Noble, Nordstrom, and AMC Theatres. There is one vacant anchor store that was once Boston Store. History Mayfair Mall opened in October 1958, featuring more than 70 stores. The mall's original design was a open-air concourse, with Marshall Field's as the northern anchor and Gimbels as the southern anchor. Chicago-based Marshall Field's opened at Mayfair in 1959 to complement Gimbels, which opened just prior to Mayfair being dedicated. Three east–west corridors (North Mall, Central Park, and South Mall) ran the width of the mall, with each corridor decorated in a different color. The mall's central court also featured a park, which included trees, flowers, benches and picnic tables. In 1973 the 'new' Mayfair Mall was advertised. The mall was fully enclosed. An arcade called The Bazaar replaced the Central Park area of Mayfair. An office tower was built on the southwest side of the mall in 1975, and construction began on a second in November 1977. In 1986, Mayfair was rededicated following a $15 million remodeling effort. The Bazaar and a short- lived ice rink were both removed. A two-level atrium was built, featuring a new food court. The upper level was also expanded, adding of retail space. Following this expansion, the mall included 109 stores including Milwaukee based Boston Store which replaced Gimbels. In 1998, the shopping center was purchased by General Growth Properties. A subsequent renovation project added a movie theater and a Barnes & Noble bookstore in 1999, and more than of retail space to the upper level in 2000. The second floor of the atrium was expanded across the entire mall adding new restaurants and shops. A cinema was also added, acting as a third anchor at Mayfair. Mayfair dealt with increased competition from other Milwaukee area shopping centers, including Bayshore Town Center, which underwent remodeling and nearby Brookfield Square. After a number of incidents involving teens, Mayfair increased security and imposed a student curfew on the weekends In 2005, a Crate & Barrel opened in front of the main mall entrance. The General Cinema multiplex was acquired by AMC Theatres after GCC's purchase by AMC.

History =Military use= The site known as Camp Hero, or the Montauk Air Force Station, was originally commissioned by the U.S. Army in 1942. Camp Hero was originally a coastal defense station that was disguised as a fishing village, and its location was chosen to prevent a potential invasion of New York from the sea. Camp Hero was named after Major General Andrew Hero, Jr., who was the Army's Commander of coastal artillery, who died in 1942. Three gun batteries were built at Camp Hero, replacing most of the other heavy guns in the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound, which also included Fort H. G. Wright, Fort Michie, and Fort Terry. Two batteries of two 16-inch guns each were built, Batteries 112 and 113 (officially named Battery Dunn).Berhow, p. 208 Another battery of two 6-inch guns was also built, Battery 216. All three batteries consisted mainly of a large concrete bunker covered with earth, containing ammunition magazines and fire control equipment. The 16-inch guns were protected by large casemates, the 6-inch guns by shields.Camp Hero at FortWiki.com In 1992, Preston Nichols and Peter Moon wrote The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time in which they alleged that secret experiments were carried out at the Camp Hero site. The book was popular with conspiracy theorists, and spawned several sequels. =Post-military use= In 1984, the General Services Administration attempted to sell the entire facility to real estate developers. Local environmental activists protested, claiming that the site had many unique ecosystems and animal habitats. The remaining portions of the military reservation at Montauk were decommissioned and most of the facility, including Camp Hero, was donated to the National Park Service, which then turned it over to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. Portions not deemed environmentally sensitive were sold off. Camp Hero remained largely undeveloped through the 1980s and 1990s. In 1996, a feasibility study was undertaken for developing the site as a golf course. However, environmentalists were concerned that the golf course would impact rare species of plants and endangered wildlife such as the blue-spotted salamander and eastern tiger salamander, and that irrigation would deplete limited sources of groundwater on the peninsula. Although there was demand to create new golf courses on Long Island, particularly on the East End, the idea of creating a new golf course in Montauk in addition to Montauk Downs State Park was dropped in 1999. Camp Hero State Park was opened to the public on September 18, 2002. There are plans to create a museum and an interpretive center that will focus on World War II and Cold War history inside the radar tower. Some parts of the camp remained closed off and guarded, especially the areas near the old satellite installations. The show Stranger Things is based in part on supposed experiments conducted at Camp Hero. Park description Camp Hero State Park offers picnic areas, a beach, and trails for hiking, biking, horseback riding, and cross-country skiing. It is a popular surf fishing beach due to the underwater structure that tends to hold fish. Common game fish found in this area are striped bass and bluefish. Portions of the former military installation within the park are registered as a National Historic Site.

Iyengar was the Advocate-General of Madras Presidency from 1916 to 1920. He also served as a member of the bar council from 1912 to 1920, the law member of Madras Presidency from 1916 to 1920 and as the president of the Swarajya Party faction of the Indian National Congress from 1923 to 1930. Srinivasa Iyengar was the son-in-law of renowned lawyer and first Indian Advocate-general of Madras, Sir Vembaukum Bhashyam Aiyangar. Iyengar's followers called him Lion of the South. Srinivasa Iyengar was born in the Ramanathapuram district of Madras Presidency. He graduated in law and practised as a lawyer in the Madras High Court rising to become Advocate-General in 1916. He also served as a member of the bar council and was nominated as the law member of the Governor's executive council. He resigned his Advocate-General post, his seat in the Governor's executive council and returned his C. I. E. in 1920 in protest against the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and joined the Indian National Congress. He participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement. However, in 1923, he broke away along with other leaders as Motilal Nehru and Chittaranjan Das due to differences with Mahatma Gandhi over participating in elections. The breakaway faction later formed the Swarajya Party. Iyengar served as the President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee and later, the Madras Province Swarajya Party and was the leader of the party when it refused to form the government in the province despite winning a majority in the 1926 elections. In later life, he established the Independence of India league and organised protests against the Simon Commission. He retired from politics due to differences with other Congress politicians over the goal of Dominion status. He briefly returned to politics in 1938. On 19 May 1941, Iyengar died in his house in Madras. Srinivasa Iyengar remains the youngest lawyer from the Madras bar to be made Advocate-General. Srinivasa Iyengar was also the mentor of freedom-fighters U. Muthuramalingam Thevar and Sathyamurthy. K. Kamaraj, who later became the President of Tamil Nadu Congress Committee and served as the Chief Minister of Madras from 1954 to 1962 is believed to be his greatest find. Srinivasa Iyengar's 1939 book on \\"Mayne's Hindu laws\\" is a much- acclaimed and well read book. During Iyengar's tenure as leader, the Congress was often criticised by Periyar and politicians of the Justice Party as a party dominated by Brahmins. This was because top Congress leaders as Iyengar, Sathyamurthy and C. Rajagopalachari were all Brahmins. Early life Srinivasa Iyengar was born on 11 September 1874 to Seshadri Iyengar, a prominent landowner of Ramanathapuram district. His parents were orthodox Sri Vaishnava Brahmins of Madras Presidency. Srinivasa Iyengar had his schooling in Madurai and graduated from Presidency College, Madras. His early schooling was in his mother tongue, Tamil. Legal career Srinivasa Iyengar commenced practice as lawyer in the Madras High Court in 1898. He had an extensive knowledge of Hindu Dharmasastra and this helped him make a mark for himself. Soon, Iyengar became the right-hand for C. Sankaran Nair.Some Madras Leaders, Pg 11 During this time, the Indian freedom-fighter S. Satyamurthi worked as a junior under Iyengar. Later, he followed Iyengar into the Indian National Congress and the Indian independence movement. Satyamurthi worked under Iyengar while he was the president of the Swarajya Party. He later referred to Iyengar as his \\"political mentor\\". In 1911, Bhupendranath Basu introduced the Civil Marriages Bill in the Imperial legislature. This bill was heavily criticised. Iyengar led agitations for the bill. When V. Krishnaswamy Iyer was criticised by extremists after his death, Iyengar defended him. In 1912, Iyengar was appointed to the Madras Bar Council and he served from 1912 to 1916. In 1916, he became the Advocate-General of Madras Presidency, the youngest ever to occupy the post. He also served as a member of the Madras Senate from 1912 to 1916. In recognition of his services, Srinivasa Iyengar was appointed Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1920 New Year Honours.K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar, Pg 5 Iyengar also served as the Law member on the executive council of the Governor of Madras from 1916 to 1920. Political activities = Indian independence movement = Right from his younger days, Srinivasa Iyengar displayed an interest, though trivial, in politics. He attended the historically significant 1907 session of the Indian National Congress held at Surat which is remembered for the split between the moderates and the extremists.Sastry, Pg 5 In 1908, V. Krishnaswamy Iyer introduced him to Rash Behari Bose \\"as the son-in-law of Sir V. Bhashyam Aiyangar and in some ways greater than him\\". However, Iyengar took politics seriously only after the Jallianwala Bagh episode. In 1920, Srinivasa Iyengar resigned as the Advocate-General of Madras and from the Governor's executive council protesting the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre.Sastry, Pg 102 In February 1921, he also returned his C.I.E in protest. He joined the Indian National Congress and participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement. In 1927, Srinivasa Iyengar chaired the reception committee of the 29th session of the Indian National Congress which met in Madras.Sastry, Pg 25 Iyengar presided over the 1920 Madras Provincial Conference held at Tinnevely and participated in the Congress sessions held at Ahmedabad(1921), Gaya(1922), Kakinada(1923), Delhi(1923), Belgaum(1924), Kanpur(1925), Gauhati(1926), Madras (1927), Calcutta(1928) and Lahore (1929). His work is believed to have given an unparalleled lead to the Congress in Madras for about ten years. Srinivasa Iyengar presided over the Guwahati session of the Congress in 1926. Iyengar worked hard to deliver a resolution upholding Hindu-Muslim unity, bringing about a temporary political agreement between the political leaders of the two communities. He published Swaraj Constitution, in 1927, outlining a federal scheme of government for future India. = Madras Province Swarajya Party = When the Congress split in 1923 between the Gandhians and those in support of Council entry, Srinivasa Iyengar was in the non-Gandhian camp and founded the Madras Province Swarajya Party. The Madras Province Swarajya Party contested in the elections to the provincial legislature held between 11 September 1923 and 10 November 1923. Though, as expected, the performance of the Swarajya Party wasn't by any means remarkable, its presence had a major impact on the fortunes of the Justice Party whose majority was considerably reduced compared to the 1920 elections. The Swaraj Party won 20 seats in the 98 member assembly and was the leading opposition party. More importantly, however, the Justice Party won just 44 seats in the 1923 elections compared to the 1920 elections when it had won 64 seats. The Raja of Panagal was elected for a second term as Premier while Srinivasa Iyengar was elected leader of opposition in the assembly. A little later, a few prominent members of the Justice Party broke off to form the United Nationalist Party and projected themselves as \\"Democrats\\". The dissidents were led by C. R. Reddy, a leader of the Justice Party, who complained of the dictatorial rule of the Raja and his insensitive, unimaginative policies. Backed by Srinivasa Iyengar and the Swarajists, Reddy introduced a no-confidence motion against the government of the Raja of Panagal on 27 November 1923. The no-confidence motion was, however, defeated by a margin of 65 votes to 44. The Swarajya Party won 44 seats in the 1926 elections and emerged as the single largest party in the house. Comparatively, the Justice Party had won just 20 seats. The Raja of Panagal stepped down as Premier. The Governor Lord Goschen invited Srinivasa Iyengar as leader of opposition to form the government. However, Srinivasa Iyengar refused. As a result, the Governor set up an independent government under P. Subbarayan and nominated 34 members to the assembly to support it. Because of the fact that Subbarayan's regime was appointed and largely controlled by the Governor, it became the target of strong criticism both from the Justicites as well as the Swarajists. In March 1927, P. Munuswamy Naidu of the Justice Party passed a motion recommending salary cuts for Government ministers. However, they were defeated by a margin of 41 votes. A no-confidence motion was passed on 23 August 1927, but was defeated 56 to 67 with the support of the Governor and the members nominated by him. The Simon Commission was appointed by the British Parliament in 1927 to report on the working of the progress of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms. The Swarajya Party moved a resolution to boycott the Commission and this was passed 61 to 50 with 12 remaining neutral. Subbarayan opposed the resolution but his cabinet ministers Ranganatha Mudaliar and Arogyaswamy Mudaliar supported it. Subbarayan resigned as Chief Minister, but at the same time, he also compelled his ministers to submit their resignations. Fearing the possibility of the formation of a Swarajya Party-Justice Party coalition Government, the Governor stepped in to foster discord amongst the opposition. To obtain the support of the Raja of Panagal,he appointed Krishnan Nair, a leading member of the Justice Party as his Law Member. Led by the Raja of Panagal, the Justice Party switched sides and lent its support to the Subbarayan government. Soon afterward, the Justice Party passed a resolution welcoming the Simon Commission. The Simon Commission visited Madras on 28 February 1928 and 18 February 1929 and was boycotted by the Swarajya Party and the Indian National Congress. However, the Justicites and the Subbarayan Government accorded the Commission a warm reception. =Nehru report= See Also: Simon Commission In the Congress session held at Nagpur in November 1927, decision was made to draw up a \\"Labour Constitution of the future Government of India\\". Motilal Nehru was elected as the convenor of the Constitution Drafting Committee. On 10 August 1928, the committee submitted its report declaring dominion status as the goal of the Congress. The report was presented at the Lucknow session of the Indian National Congress held between 28 August 1928 and 31 August 1928. On 30 August 1928, Jawaharlal Nehru, Srinivasa Iyengar and Subhas Chandra Bose formed the Indian Independence League. This league declared purna swaraj or complete independence from British rule as its ultimate goal and not dominion status. Srinivasa Iyengar was elected President of the league with Nehru and Bose as its secretaries. When the All-Parties Report (known as the Nehru Report) was published in 1928 outlining a constitution for India in terms of Dominion status, Srinivasa Iyengar organised the Independence League with himself as President and Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose as leading members. Iyengar was elected President of the Congress Democratic Party with Subhas Chandra Bose as its Secretary.Sastry, Pg 47 Srinivasa Iyengar, however, announced his retirement from active public life early in 1930.  Later life  Srinivasa Iyengar briefly returned to politics in 1938 and supported Subhas Chandra Bose as president of the Congress.

In his later life, he became a Hindu monk and adopted the name Swami Anvananda.  Legacy  Besides law, Srinivasa Iyengar's other interest were education, social reform, and politics. Iyengar's 1939 book Mayne's Hindu Law is considered to be a masterpiece.Sastry, Pg 100 Among his early influences were Sir Sankaran Nair and C. Vijayaraghavachariar, two former Congress leaders. He was also an admirer of Gopal Krishna Gokhale (in whose name he endowed a prize) and later of Mahatma Gandhi. Iyengar was the personal lawyer and a family friend of Muthuramalingam Thevar whom he encouraged to participate in the 1927 Congress session that was held in Madras.

He was a staunch believer in the concept of \\"linked leadership\\". He was responsible for the induction of K. Kamaraj and Muthuramalinga Thevar in the Indian National Congress. Iyengar's followers and colleagues called him \\"Lion of the South\\".  Criticism  At the 1920 session of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, E. V. Ramasamy, a leader of the Congress desired to propose a resolution introducing communal representation in education and employment. However, Iyengar who presided over the session refused to permit it reasoning that it would cause unnecessary communal tension. Periyar criticised Iyengar along with the rest of the Brahmin leadership of the Congress and declared that non- Brahmins can never hope to get justice from the Congress.

The original was only the fourth lightship designed and commissioned to serve a U.S. coastal port. One of these, Lightship Ambrose (built 1908) is now a museum in New York City. The original light station was put into operation on August 23, 1967, replacing the obsolete Lightship Ambrose, and cost $2.4 million. The tower design was a Texas Tower, a very strong steel pipe structure based on the oil platforms built for use in the Gulf of Mexico. The structure was prefabricated in Norfolk, Virginia and shipped in sections on barges for assembly on-site. The tower station was situated about off of the coast of Sandy Hook, New Jersey in approximately of water and was supported by four steel pipes, sunk down about to the bedrock. The light was about above mean low water and the 10,000,000 candle-power light could be seen for . The lower deck was designed for fuel and water storage while the top deck served as living quarters for a 6 to 9 man crew. The roof of the platform also served as a flight deck for helicopters, the main mode of transport to and from the station for crew rotations. The tower was automated and the crew was removed from duty on October 15, 1988. Ambrose light station was controlled electronically by the United States Coast Guard station on Governors Island until the island and base were transferred to New York State and City for $1 in 2003. In October 1996, on a clear night the Greek oil tanker Aegeo struck the tower, causing severe damage. Coast Guard Lighthouse Technicians verified that the light was functioning properly when the tanker hit the tower. The Aegeo's captain was later found to be at fault. Three years later, in September 1999 after repairs were deemed insufficient, the old structure was razed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and replaced with a new tower. The new tower was built about east of the old site, and was approximately above mean low water, and the 60,000 candle-power light was visible for . In January 2001, the Maltese freighter Kouros V struck the new tower. The tower suffered extensive damage, and the light was rendered inoperable.

It was originally published in January 1995 by Alfred A. Knopf. In 1995, Nicholas Negroponte outlines the history of digital technologies in his book, Being Digital. Along with the general history, he also predicts possibilities for the future of these technologies and where he sees their focus on advancement lacking such as his belief that high-definition television becomes obsolete in comparison to its transition to a digital medium. Being Digital provides a general history of several digital media technologies, many that Negroponte himself was directly involved in developing. The message in Nicholas Negroponte's, Being Digital, is that eventually, we will move toward an entirely digital society (be it newspapers, entertainment, or sex). Being Digital also introduces the \\"Daily Me\\" concept of a virtual daily newspaper customized for an individual's tastes. This prediction has also come to pass with the advent of web feeds and personal web portals.  Synopsis  Being Digital is made up of an introduction, three parts, and an epilogue. In the first part Negroponte discusses the fundamental difference between bits and atoms. He describes \\"atoms\\" as a weighted mass form such as a book and \\"bits\\" as \\"instantaneous and inexpensive transfer of electronic data\\" that \\"move at the speed of light.\\" The \\"bit\\" is digital or virtual where there is no mass and it can travel and communicate instantaneously throughout multiple platforms. The public utilizes and depends on the information superhighway because the people demand instantaneous results. Bits bring upon instant results without weight or physical matter to rummage through. Decentralizing, globalizing, harmonizing, and empowering are the four qualities of the digital age. Negroponte points out that though we are emerging into a digital world, we still experience the world in analog form. Analog form consists of many atoms the senses, such as sight and touch, are analog receptors. A disadvantage he points out about bits is the \\"constraints of the medium on which it is stored or through which it is delivered.\\" In part two, Negroponte discusses the importance of the computer's user interface and how underdeveloped design and functionality can make \\"being digital\\" so needlessly complicated. Negroponte views good interface design as the computer's ability to \\"know you, learn about your needs, and understand verbal and nonverbal languages.\\" Negroponte also discusses the importance of a computer's graphical persona and how that influences users' interactions with the machine. In part three, \\"Digital Life\\", the author states that humanity is in the post-information age where \\"true personalization\\" is imminent. The machines will understand individuals and their preferences as humans understand humans. =\\"Negroponte Switch\\"= In the 1980s, Negroponte had originated an idea that came to be known as the \\"Negroponte Switch.\\" Negroponte Switch refers to the information transmission medium used by different devices. He suggested that due to accidents of engineering history we had ended with static devices such as televisions receiving their content via signals traveling over the airways, while devices that should have been mobile and personal, such as telephones, were receiving their content over static cables. It was his idea that a better use of available communication resources would result if information such as phone calls going through cables was to go through the air, and information now going through the air, such as television signals, was to be delivered over cables. Negroponte called this \\"trading places\\", but his co-presenter, George Gilder, at an event organized by Northern Telecom called it the \\"Negroponte Switch\\" and the name stuck. An example is telephones, The mobility that cellular phones provided meant that telephones would become wireless, while the increasing bandwidth requirements for television meant that they would become hardwired.  Analysis  = Manipulation of bits = Much of what Negroponte states is that there is more dependency on the \\"bits\\", and that they are not confined to the \\"constraints of physical reality\\". However, the energy and material that make up these bits prove that information technology is very much \\"grounded in the physical environment\\". James Martin, in response to Negroponte's assumption, calls this new dematerialized world the \\"Wired Society\\". Martin predicts that the information superhighway allows for a \\"radical restructuring of both social and geographical relationships\\". The result is that people will choose the country life over the city life. Yet, this is not the case. An example Ensmenger and Slayton use is that our global climate change is very dependent on the \\"assistance of massive databases and complex programs for simulation\\". Atoms will not completely disappear because of the bit emergence.The people will not dramatically shift to the rural life because the information technology will prove simpler as the country life seems to represent. Rare earth elements are essential to both information technology and alternative fuel industries. The elements used to produce alternative fuel industries will cause electronic waste, or e-waste. This \\"implicates the entire digital economy in the transnational flow of toxic materials\\". More so, the article argues that it is not so much the \\"bits\\" that are essential for the information superhighway, but rather the electron. It is the electrification systems that prove to be more efficient in the twentieth century. Yet, it did not decrease the use of resources, or the atomic component. Computers are able to function without the \\"binary digits\\", yet they are useless without the electricity, or electron. = Back to atoms = Bernd Schmitt argues that the digital revolution is going from bits back to atoms. He says the consumer experience with \\"technocultural consumption\\" is far less favored then its physical and solid products. There is less enjoyment in the digital realm. An example is that people are less likely to \\"donate\\" for a digital souvenir than a physical souvenir, such as a photograph. He says there is a stronger sense of \\"psychological ownership\\". Physical possessions resemble a person's self-identity. Schmitt predicts that medical AI is likely to \\"become a $10 billion industry in the US by 2025 and replace 80% of the work that doctors do\\". However, people prefer human interaction regarding medical care than some algorithm-made technology. Schmitt does agree with Negroponte on the notion that whatever can be digital, will become digital. An area that is still in development is where technology is increasingly becoming humanized. Schmitt believes there will be no difference between a machine and a human being. In a group focus research conducted on gamers, it shows that a game was less enjoyed when given help from a \\"computerized helper\\" as opposed to a helper \\"construed as a mindless entity\\". = The digital = Thomas Haigh argues that \\"the digital\\" has always been sold to be a new realm of human experience. However, the digital stems from the AMC \\"computing machinery\\" because of the quantities the computer calculated with were represented by numbers 1s and 0s binary numbers. He argues that the term digital was not necessary to use with computers by the 1970s. In 1993, Wired released a new resonance of the term digital. In Wired, Negroponte promotes the idea of \\"the digital\\". He states that Negronponte claims past things made of atoms are all important, and in the future everything that mattered would be \\"made of bits\\". Elaborating on the fact that the computer's digital nature and main focal points shouldn't just be on it being an \\"information machine\\". He the quotes Negroponte's predictions of \\"cuff links or earrings communicating with each other, phones being able to respond to calls, socializing in digital neighborhoods, mass media being refined by systems for transmitting and receiving personalized information and entertainment, and more\\". Haigh agrees that \\"our phones do support call screenings, online communities have contributed to increasing curtail and political polarization\\". Also, new platforms like Netflix, social media and YouTube have done more that \\"refine\\" mass media. The digital environment that Negroponte has mentioned is a new area of \\"the digital\\", but \\"the digital\\" has been a thing since 1940s. Negroponte predictions relate more to the \\"future area\\" which is the current. = Cybernetic subjectivity = Timothy Luke prefers the notion of \\"cybernetic subjectivity\\" as opposed to Negroponte's concept of being digital. He says it better exemplifies the idea that being digital is more an idea of teaching individuals what or how to think. They develop an additional consciousness.  Some Varieties of Digital Being  The government is one preliminary form. It is when the government and politics use persuasive tactics on the people's decision making. Voters do not act on their own will but rather become these mind-trained or manipulated robots. Being digital is \\"animal- like\\". Luke categorizes digitalization into categories: Nature/Culture, Humanity/Technology, History/Society, and Being/Time. He points out that Negroponte recognizes that humans are a form of atoms and realms of \\"mentality, dimensionality, and temporality\\" unfold into bits This concept is what cybernetic subjectivity is all about.  Virtual Personae  Luke talks of the hacker, telecommuter, or the web surfer emerging and representing themselves as cyber subjects. He says these positions of \\"individual agency are more than minor variants of conventional tool usage\\" and that they bring more participation in which causes a buzz or stir.  Androidized Machines  Another form is the transformation of devices into smart-talking digital beings. Human-like traits of consciousness, intelligence, personality, memory, speech, and experience are embedded into once non interactive machines. Luke explains this as Negroponte's bits occupying atoms.  Netizenship  Luke says there is an issue with many people putting trust in Negroponte's optimism of the new age in multimedia and various platforms. He believes few look at the consequences of the netizens producing a better world from emerging technology and greater social participation. Luke says Negroponte's \\"lame musings of being digital\\" is a more compound subject and of something more significant. The significance is that being digital is rather digital beings \\"affecting our history, politics, and culture\\".  Reception  In an essay review by Marshall Ruffin, he says Negroponte presents the concept of our society migrating from analog to digital communication in a simplistic way that includes \\"humor, grace, and no equations\\". Ruffin says the book is an \\"enthusiastic prose\\" piece that is full of \\"import without technical detail\\". The lack of technical detail is something that F. W. Landcaster addresses as a problem in his 1996 review, stating the book is \\"more sociological than technological\\" which is a result of discussing ideas of futuristic technologies without providing enough detail. However, Landcaster agrees with Ruffin and appreciates the book's coherence and inclusion of \\"interesting anecdotes and nice humor\\". In a 1995 review, Samuel C. Florman acknowledges Negroponte's view of the impending digital age, but finds its implications rather \\"sinister\\". He views the book as a piece that \\"celebrates information while disparaging the material world\\". This outlook is one that reaffirmed his connection to the physical, which are the atoms Negroponte believes will be phased out. Kirkus Reviews states that although the book offers \\"informed observations\\" on how technology will impact the future, it offers little useful analysis on these concepts. Its wide array of content is scattered and disorganized\\" and is difficult to follow due to a \\"veering between oversimplification and clunky jargon\\". Its main takeaway lies in its \\"occasional flashes of insight\\", but is a piece that is muddled by \\"retreated cyber-hype and familiar predictions\\". A common source of concern for many reviews is that Negroponte fails to address the negative implications of being digital. Landcaster and Alex Raksin cite copyright as a prevailing issue that Negroponte does not offer insight on how such data can be protected. Simson L. Garfinkel's concern lies within Negroponte's optimism deterring him from considering the potential misuse of the \\"highly detailed, personal information\\" that is used to fuel this advancement in technology. Scott London, a California-based author and journalist, reviewed the book as \\"Being Dismal\\", and does not \\"claim\\" the same digital technology optimism Negroponte holds for the future. In an essay review, Barry M. Katz describes the book to be filled with \\"stimulating, suggestive ideas that can only feed the imagination\\". However, Katz does recognize that Negroponte writes with \\"uncritical zeal\\", and says that although the book predicts the future with \\"advent steam\\", it fails to acknowledge the world \\"that passed\\". Martin Levinson says reading the book will \\"allow you to talk more intelligently with technologically sophisticated young people\\", and suggests for people to become familiar with Negroponte's \\"bits and other digital jargon\\" because the future is being shaped by the \\"digiterati\\". Haigh reviews the timeline of how \\"being digital\\" has transformed into different meanings over the years. He goes over his thoughts and ideas about if we are truly being digital today. He discusses the book and analyzes the predictions contained therein.

After completing Tom Sawyer for Paramount Pictures in 1930, he continued working at the studio for more than twenty years. The style of lighting he introduced in A Farewell to Arms became heavily identified with all of Paramount's films during the 1930s and 1940s, though he occasionally worked for other studios, for instance on The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947). In 1951, he began the second phase of his career, this time as a free-lance cinematographer. His credits include The Big Heat (1953) with Glenn Ford and Lee Marvin, Sabrina (1954) with Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, Gunfight at the O.K.

He wrote a number of books on the Ozarks, as well as Little Blue Books and juvenile fiction. Early life Randolph was born in Pittsburg, Kansas in 1892, the son of a lawyer and a teacher. Despite being born in a privileged home, Randolph dropped out of high school to work on left-leaning publications. This did not stop him from attending college and he graduated from what is now Pittsburg State University in 1914. He pursued graduate work at Clark University and received a Master of Arts degree in psychology. He later dedicated his book Ozark Superstitions (1947) to the memory of his Clark mentor G. Stanley Hall. In 1917 he was drafted into the U.S. Army, and served until the next year when he was given a disability discharge never serving overseas.https://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/r/randolph/[Historic Missourians: The State Historical Society] Career In 1927, Randolph had his first article published in the Journal of American Folklore, based on work on Ozark dialect and folk beliefs. The dialect work led to multiple publications throughout the 1920s and 1930s in American Speech and Dialect Notes. He moved to Pineville, McDonald County, Missouri in 1919. He never moved away from the Ozarks and remained in the Ozark Mountains from 1920 until his death. He made a living by writing for sporting and outdoor publications. While writing, Randolph used pseudonyms, but never for his work on the Ozark culture. Randolph also wrote about non-folklore aspects of Ozark society, such as music. His Ozark Mountain Folks (1932) describes the creation of a distinctive church choir singing style created by a corps of uncredentialled, itinerant choral instructors. Pissing in the Snow and Other Ozark Folktales (1976) was a national bestseller. He published over a dozen works on Ozark folklore. In 1949 he and the poet John Gould Fletcher founded the Ozark Folklore Society. Honors In 1951 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Arkansas. A longtime member of The Missouri Folklore Society, he was elected a Fellow of the American Folklore Society in 1978. Personal life He met his first wife in McDonald County, Marie Wardlaw Wilbur and married in 1919. He married his second wife, Mary Celestia Parler in 1962.

The current release, version 2020 (Release 20 internally), is available only as part of the Corel's WordPerfect Office productivity suite. History Presentations shares much of its code with WordPerfect. It originally evolved from DrawPerfect, a MS-DOS-based drawing program released in 1990 by the now- defunct WordPerfect Corporation. The first version, WordPerfect Presentations 2.0 for DOS, appeared in 1993, and was followed by a Microsoft Windows port of the DOS version a few months later. Due to severe usability and performance issues, the first Windows version was not considered a serious contender in the market. Novell acquired WordPerfect Corporation in April 1994 and shipped an upgrade of Presentations, Novell Presentations 3.0 for Windows, as part of the Novell PerfectOffice 3.0 for Windows productivity suite in December 1994. Corel acquired PerfectOffice in January 1996 and released the first 32-bit version of Presentations in May of that year. Since then, the company has issued twelve upgrades: version 8 (1997), version 9 (1999), version 10 (2001), version 11 (2003), version 12 (2004), version 13 (2006), version 14 (2008), version 15 (2010), version 16 (2012), version 17 (2014), version 18 (2016), version 19 (2018) and version 20 (2020). The last DOS release, version 2.1, appeared in 1997 as part of the Corel WordPerfect Suite for DOS. Corel Presentations for Linux was included with the various editions of Corel WordPerfect Office for Linux. Corel no longer develops programs for the Linux operating system. User interface Over the years, the program's interface has evolved to more closely resemble that of Microsoft PowerPoint. Its primary strengths remain in the areas of graphics manipulation, although it does include a number of advanced transition and animation effects not found in its competitors. The program also has the ability to save to Microsoft PowerPoint and PDF formats, as well as to publish presentations to the Internet. Features Corel Presentations can be a handy tool for creating effective and in-depth presentations. This program includes a number of templates and different types of slide shows to help to lay out an end user's show properly. The templates include a set background, font, color and set up of the slide. These defaults can be changed within the slide show.

The Outer Limits was the final album to feature vocalist Denis Bélanger until his 2002 return. It was also Voivod's first album without original bassist Blacky, who had left the band before the release of the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful 1991 album Angel Rat. Uncomfortable with the idea of bringing in an immediate replacement for Blacky, Voivod opted to have session musician Pierre St-Jean play bass guitar for the recording of the album. In March 2018, the album, along with Nothingface and Angel Rat, was reissued on CD in Japan as a budget edition.

Stated throughout history in one form or another, the belief in this right has been used to justify various revolutions, including the American Revolution, French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and the Iranian Revolution. History =Early examples= Ancient China To justify their overthrowing of the earlier Shang Dynasty, the kings of the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256 BC) of China promulgated the concept known as the Mandate of Heaven, that Heaven would bless the authority of a just ruler, but would be displeased and withdraw its mandate from a despotic ruler.Perry, Elizabeth. [2002] (2002). Challenging the Mandate of Heaven: Social Protest and State Power in China. Sharpe. The Mandate of Heaven would then transfer to those who would rule best. Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that the Mandate of Heaven had passed on. Throughout Chinese history, rebels who opposed the ruling dynasty made the claim that the Mandate of Heaven had passed, giving them the right to revolt. Ruling dynasties were often uncomfortable with this, and the writings of the Confucian philosopher Mencius (372–289 BC) were often suppressed for declaring that the people have the right to overthrow a ruler that did not provide for their needs. Ancient Rome The Roman Republic was established following the overthrow of the Roman monarchy. The populist leader Tiberius Gracchus attempted to show just cause for his right to undermine the power of the tribune Marcus Octavius by arguing that a tribune of the people who violates his duty to serve them ought to suffer deposition, since 'he stands deprived by his own act of honours and immunities, by the neglect of the duty for which the honour was bestowed upon him.' Tiberius Gracchus even went as far as to say that he 'who assails the power of the people is no longer a tribune at all.' To strengthen his case, Tiberius Gracchus highlighted the precedent of the deposition of Tarquin the Proud 'when he acted wrongfully; and for the crime of one single man, the ancient government under which Rome was built was abolished forever.'Plutarch (1952). Tiberius Gracchus (J. Dryden, Trans.). In R. M. Hutchins (Ed.), Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans (1st ed., Vol. 14, Great Books of the Western World, pp. 671-681). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. (Original work published 1927) From then on, the historian Edward Gibbon observes, 'the ambitious Roman who should dare to assume their title or imitate [Tarquin's] tyranny was devoted to the infernal gods: each of his fellow-citizens was armed with the sword of justice; and the act of Brutus, however repugnant to gratitude or prudence, had been already sanctified by the judgement of his country.'E. Gibbon (1952). The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In R. M. Hutchins (Ed.), Gibbon II (1st ed., Vol. 41, Great Books of the Western World, p. 92). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. Following the death of Augustus, the soldier Percennius used his oratical skills to foment mutiny among the legions of Pannonia. He justified their right to violently rebel on the grounds that they deserved better treatment and greater appreciation from the state, rhetorically asking his fellow soldiers why they submitted to the centurions when military life entailed such low pay and so many years in service. He obtained a positive response. According to the historian Tacitus, 'The throng applauded from various motives, some pointing to the marks of the lash, others to their grey locks, and most of them to their threadbare garments and naked limbs.'P. Cornelius Tacitus (1952). The Annals, Book I (A. J. Church, Trans.). In R. M. Hutchins (Ed.), The Annals and Histories of Tacitus (1st ed., Vol. 15, Great Books of the Western World, pp. 1-184). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. (Original work published 1927) The Praetorian Subrius Flavus justified his right of revolution against Emperor Nero on the grounds that his crimes meant he no longer deserved the love of the people: 'I began to hate you when you became the murderer of your mother and your wife, a charioteer, an actor, and an incendiary.'Tacitus, The Annals, Book XV, p. 174 In 285 A.D., Maximian suppressed a rebellion of the Bagaudae, Gallic peasants violently resisting the tyranny of their masters. These peasants decided to fight for their natural rights, against the miserable conditions they were placed under. Gibbon notes that 'They asserted the natural rights of men, but they asserted those rights with the most savage cruelty.'E. Gibbon (1952). The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In R. M. Hutchins (Ed.), Gibbon I (1st ed., Vol. 40, Great Books of the Western World, p. 144). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. Medieval Europe Magna Carta marks one of the earliest attempts to limit a sovereign's authority and it is seen as a symbol of the rule of law. One example of the emergence of a right of revolution can be traced back to Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker, who in 1018 had a dramatic confrontation with the King of Sweden. The lawspeaker claimed the King of Sweden was accountable to the people and would be overthrown by them if he continued with his unpopular war with Norway. Another example is Magna Carta, an English charter issued in 1215, which required the King to renounce certain rights and accept that his will could be bound by the law. It included a \\"security clause\\" that gave the right to a committee of barons to overrule the will of the King through force if needed. Magna Carta directly influenced the development of parliamentary democracy and many constitutional documents, such as the United States Constitution.Ralph V. Turner. Magna Carta. Pearson Education. (2003). p.1 The Golden Bull of 1222 was a golden bull, or edict, issued by King Andrew II of Hungary. The law established the rights of Hungary's noblemen, including the right to disobey the King when he acted contrary to law (jus resistendi). The Golden Bull is often compared to Magna Carta; the Bull was the first constitutional document of the nation of Hungary, while Magna Carta was the first constitutional charter of the nation of England. Thomas Aquinas also writes of the right to resist tyrannical rule in the Summa Theologica. He considers a law not to be a law at all, but an act of violence, if it contradicts either human or Divine good, overextends the political power of the lawgiver, or hampers different parts of society unequally.T. Aquinas (1952). Summa Theologica, Part I-II, Question 96, Article 4 (Fathers of the English Dominican Province, Trans.). In R. M. Hutchins (Ed.), The Summa Theologica of Saint Thomas Aquinas (1st ed., Vol. 20, Great Books of the Western World, pp. 445-548). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. (Original work published 1947) For Aquinas, it is not inherently seditious to overthrow a tyrannical lawgiver. Rather, it is the tyrant who commits 'sedition', by which Aquinas means disturbance of those who work together lawfully for the good of the multitude: > Indeed it is the tyrant rather that is guilty of sedition, since he > encourages discord and sedition among his subjects, that he may lord over > them more securely; for this is tyranny, since it is ordered to the private > good of the ruler and to the injury of the multitude.'Aquinas, Summa > Theologica, Part II-II, Question 42, Article 2, Reply 3 Nicole Oresme, in his Livre de Politiques, categorically denied any right of resistance. John of Salisbury advocated direct revolutionary assassination of unethical tyrannical rulers in his Policraticus. Early Modern Europe Theological notions of the right of revolution were elaborated in the Early Modern Period. The Jesuits, especially Robert Bellarmine and Juan de Mariana, were widely known and often feared for advocating resistance to tyranny and often tyrannicide--one of the implications of the natural law focus of the School of Salamanca. John Calvin believed something similar. In a commentary on the Book of Daniel, he observed that contemporary monarchs pretend to reign \\"by the grace of God\\", but the pretense was \\"a mere cheat\\" so that they could \\"reign without control\\". He believed that \\"Earthly princes depose themselves while they rise up against God\\", so \\"it behooves us to spit upon their heads than to obey them\\". When ordinary citizens are confronted with tyranny, he wrote, ordinary citizens have to suffer it. But magistrates have the duty to \\"curb the tyranny of kings\\", as had the Tribunes of the Plebs in ancient Rome, the Ephors in Sparta, and the Demarchs in ancient Athens. That Calvin could support a right of resistance in theory did not mean that he thought such resistance prudent in all circumstances. At least publicly, he disagreed with the Scottish Calvinist John Knox's call for revolution against the Catholic Queen Mary I Tudor of England. Dave Kopel, \\"The Calvinist Connection\\", Liberty (libertarian magazine), October 2008, pp. 27–31 DaveKopel.com The Catholic Church shared Calvin's prudential concerns – the Pope condemned Guy Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot, and Regnans in Excelsis was widely considered to be a mistake. Instead, the safest course of action for the people was to endure tyranny for as long as it could be borne, rather than run the larger risks of armed revolution. The right of revolution was expounded by the Monarchomachs in the context of the French Wars of Religion, and by Huguenots thinkers who legitimized tyrannicides. In the last chapter of The Prince, Niccolò Machiavelli exhorts the Medici family to take up violent insurrection 'to liberate Italy from the barbarians'. He explains how the political circumstances of the day give justification for the Medici's right of revolution: > Italy, left without life, waits for him who shall yet heal her wounds and > put an end to the ravaging and plundering of Lombardy, to the swindling and > taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany, and cleanse those sores that for long > have festered. It is seen how she entreats God to send someone who will > deliver her from these wrongs and barbarous insolencies. It is seen also > that she is ready and willing to follow a banner if only someone will raise > it.N. Machiavelli (1952). To Liberate Italy, Chapter XXVI (W. K. Marriott, > Trans.). In R. M. Hutchins (Ed.), The Prince (1st ed., Vol. 23, Great Books > of the Western World, pp. 36-37). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia > Britannica. (Original work published 1908) =Philosophical views= John Locke Two Treatises of Government, written by John Locke, developed the idea of 'right of revolution'. This notion was used as a basis for the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Perhaps no other major philosopher has written as much directly about the right of revolution as the Enlightenment thinker John Locke. The concept was developed in his work Two Treatises of Government, especially its last two chapters, 'Of Tyranny' and 'Of the Dissolution of Government'. The right formed an integral part of his social contract theory, in which he tried to define the origins and basis for social conditions and relationships. Locke declared that under natural law, all people have the right to life, liberty, and estate; under the social contract, the people could instigate a revolution against the government when it acted against the interests of citizens, to replace the government with one that served the interests of citizens. In some cases, Locke deemed revolution an obligation. The right of revolution thus essentially acted as a safeguard against tyranny. Locke affirmed an explicit right to revolution in Two Treatises of Government: > \\"whenever the Legislators endeavor to take away, and destroy the Property of > the People, or to reduce them to Slavery under Arbitrary Power, they put > themselves into a state of War with the People, who are thereupon absolved > from any farther Obedience, and are left to the common Refuge, which God > hath provided for all Men, against Force and Violence. Whensoever therefore > the Legislative shall transgress this fundamental Rule of Society; and > either by Ambition, Fear, Folly or Corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, > or put into the hands of any other an Absolute Power over the Lives, > Liberties, and Estates of the People; By this breach of Trust they forfeit > the Power, the People had put into their hands, for quite contrary ends, and > it devolves to the People, who have a Right to resume their original > Liberty.\\"Powell, Jim (1 August 1996). \\"John Locke: Natural Rights to Life, > Liberty, and Property\\". In The Freemann. Foundation for Economic Education, > Irvington, New York, US. Locke specifically challenged those rulers who meddled with a citizen's right to estate. In his mind, these governments are their own undoing. He believed that 'governments are dissolved' when 'they endeavour to invade the property of the subject', since it is the right of the people to 'choose and authorise a legislative' and accompanying institutions that act 'as guards and fences to the properties of all society'.Locke, Concerning Civil Government, Chapter XIX, Section 221, p. 75 In other writings, he used the analogy of a robber to explain why tyrannical infringement on property produces illegitimate law: 'Should a robber break into my house, and, with a dagger at my throat, make me seal deeds to convey my estate to him, would this give him any title? Just such a title by his sword has an unjust conqueror who forces me into submission. The injury and the crime is equal, whether comitted by the wearer of a crown or some petty villain.'J. Locke (1952). Concerning Civil Government, Chapter XVI, Section 176, p. 66 Locke (1st ed., Vol. 35, Great Books of the Western World) Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. Thus, according to Locke, if a government acts against a citizen's right of property, that citizen may exercise his right of revolution against that government. Locke drew on the Old Testament story of Hezekiah's rebellion against the King of Assyria to make the case that God is on the side of any people rebelling against unrighteous rule, saying that 'it is plain that shaking off a power which force, and not right, hath set over any one, though it hath the name of rebellion, yet it is no offence before God, but that which He allows and countenances'.Locke, Concerning Civil Government, Chapter XVI, Section 196, p. 70 Like Aquinas, Locke believed that the truly seditious or rebellious individuals are not those who change the legislative to ensure public wellbeing, but the despots who violated public wellbeing in the first place with their illegitimate laws, 'For when men, by entering into society and civil government, have excluded force, and introduced laws for the preservation of property, peace, and unity among themselves, those who set up force again in opposition to the law, do rebellare - that is, bring back again the state of war, and are properly rebels'.Locke, Concerning Civil Government, Chapter XIX, Section 226, p. 77 Also like Aquinas, Locke considered it just for a subject to disobey any ruler overextending his political power. In A Letter Concerning Toleration, he argued that 'if the law, indeed, be concerning things that lie not within the verge of the magistrates authority, [...] men are not in these cases obliged by that law, against their consciences.'J. Locke (1952). A Letter Concerning Toleration. In C. L. Sherman (Ed.), Locke (1st ed., Vol. 35, Great Books of the Western World, pp. 1-22) Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. (Original work published 1923) However, Locke was not only a proponent of fighting tyranny through civil disobedience of unjust laws. He also suggested using violent insurrection in situations where an illegitimate centre of power, such as a rogue executive, has used force to subdue the supreme power in the land, that is, the legislature, > 'For having erected a legislative with an intent that [the people] should > exercise the power of making laws, [...] when they are hindered by any force > from what is so necessary to the society, and wherein the safety and > preservation of the people consists, the people have a right to remove it by > force. In all states and conditions the true remedy of force without > authority is to oppose force to it.'Locke, Concerning Civil Government, > Chapter III, Section 155, p. 61 Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality argues in favour of the right of revolution against despots. Jean-Jacques Rousseau Later, Jean-Jacques Rousseau would be in agreement on Locke's point about force, stating in his work On the Origin of Inequality that: > the contract of government is so completely dissolved by despotism, that the > despot is master only so long as he remains the strongest; as soon as he can > be expelled, he has no right to complain of violence. The popular > insurrection that ends in the death or deposition of a Sultan is as lawful > an act as those by which he disposed, the day before, of the lives and > fortunes of his subjects. He was maintained by force alone, it is force > alone that overthrows him.J. Rousseau (1952). On the Origin of Inequality. > (G. D. H. Cole, trans.) In R. M. Hutchins, Rousseau (1st ed., Vol. 28, Great > Books of the Western World, pp. 361-362) Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia > Britannica. (Original work published 1937) left Immanuel Kant Not all Enlightenment thinkers supported the rebellion principle. Immanuel Kant would have strongly disagreed with Locke and Rousseau as regards the notion of there being any general principle of a right to revolution. He believed that 'if the ruler or regent, as the organ of the supreme power, proceeds in violation of the laws, as in imposing taxes, recruiting soldiers, and so on, contrary to the law of equality in the distribution of the political burdens, the subject may oppose complaints and objections (gravamina) to this injustice, but not active resistance.' He reaffirms this repeatedly in The Metaphysics of Morals, stating that 'there is no right of sedition, and still less of revolution', the reason being that 'it is only by submission to the universal legislative will, that a condition of law and order is possible.' Moreover, Kant believed that any 'forcible compulsion of [the dethronement of a monarch], on the part of the people, cannot be justified under the pretext of a right of necessity (casus necessitatis)'.I. Kant (1952). The Science of Right. (W. Hastie, trans.) In R. M. Hutchins, Kant (1st ed., Vol. 42, Great Books of the Western World, pp. 439-441) Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. (Original work published 1887) John Stuart Mill John Stuart Mill believed in a morally justifiable form of right to revolution against tyranny, placing him firmly in the tradition of Aquinas, Locke, and Rousseau. In his introduction to On Liberty, he gave an account of the historical limitation of kingly power by the multitude, a conflict he termed 'liberty'. This progress was sought 'by obtaining a recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it was to be regarded as a breach of durty in the ruler to infringe, and which if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, was held to be justifiable.'J. S. Mill (1952). On Liberty, p. 268 J. S. Mill (1st ed., Vol. 43, Great Books of the Western World) Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. On the question of tyrannicide, Mill came down firmly in favour of the virtue of 'the act of a private citizen in striking down a criminal, who, by raising himself above the law, has placed himself beyond the reach of legal punishment or control, [since it] has been accounted by whole nations, and by some of the best and wisest of men, not a crime, but an act of exalted virtue'.Mill, On Liberty, Chapter 2, p. 274 Author Samuel Johnson saw the justifications for the right to rebel against tyranny. Samuel Johnson Scottish biographer James Boswell noted the literary critic Samuel Johnson's attack on the widespread assumption that 'the King can do no wrong': > if the abuse be enormous, Nature will rise up, and claiming her original > rights, overturn a corrupt political system. [emphasis in original] Boswell emphasised this sentence 'with peculiar pleasure, as a noble instance of that truly dignified spritit of freedom which ever glowed in his heart'.J. Boswell (1952). Life of Johnson, p. 120 Boswell (1st ed., Vol. 44, Great Books of the Western World) Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. Johnson seemed to believe that some form of a right to revolution inhered in natural law. He considered 'that in no government power can be abused long. Mankind will not bear it. If a sovereign oppresses his people to a great degree, they will rise and cut off his head. There is a remedy in human nature against tyranny, that will keep us safe under every form of government. Had not the people of France thought themselves honoured as sharing in the brilliant actions of Lewis XIV, they would not have endured him; and we may say the same of the King of Prussia's people.'Boswell, Life of Johnson, p. 195 =Use in history= Revolutionary movements subsequent to this, all drew on Locke's theory as a justification for the exercise of the right of revolution. The Glorious Revolution During the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Parliament of England effectively deposed James II of England and replaced him with William III of Orange-Nassau, due to the former's unacceptable leanings towards absolutism and Catholicism. Although Locke's treatise was published the year after, his ideas were already widely current in the English political system at the time. The storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 has come to symbolize the French Revolution, when a people rose up to exercise their right of revolution. Although Locke claimed that his book's purpose was to justify William III's ascension to the throne, it has been argued that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679–1680 during the Exclusion Crisis, which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place. Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, Locke's mentor, patron and friend, introduced the bill, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.Laslett, Peter. \\"Introduction\\". Two Treatises of Government. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988), 59–61. Alternatively, the work is better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the Rye House Plot.Ashcraft, Revolutionary Politics. The American Revolution The right to revolution played a large part in the writings of the American revolutionaries in the run up to the American Revolution. Thomas Paine's political tract Common Sense used the concept as an argument for rejection of the British monarchy and separation from the British Empire, as opposed to merely self-government within it. The right was also cited in the Declaration of Independence of the United States, written by Thomas Jefferson, two thirds of which consists of a list of the wrongs committed by King George III which violated the colonist's natural right to life, liberty, and property. According to the declaration: > 'whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is > the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new > government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its > powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their > safety and happiness.'T. Jefferson (1952). The Declaration of Indpendence In > R. M. Hutchins, American State Papers (1st ed., Vol. 43, Great Books of the > Western World, pp. 1-3) Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. > (Original work published 1776) However, the Revolution did change course to set certain limits on the right of rebellion. In Federalist No. 28, Alexander Hamilton successfully made the case for a federal standing army, in opposition to Locke's principle that a republican government rules not by violence, but by law. Hamilton thought: > 'that seditions and insurrections are, unhappily, maladies as inseperable > from the body politic as tumours and eruptions from the natural body; that > the idea of governing all at all times by the simple force of law (which we > have been told is the only admissable principle of republican government) > has no place but in the reveries of those political doctors whose sagacity > disdains the admonitions of experimental instruction.' Simply put, 'An insurrection, whatever may be its immediate cause, eventually endangers all government.' However, Hamilton did point out that the wide geography of the United States meant that a federal army could not provide absolute limitation on the right of revolution, since 'If the federal army should be able to quell the resistance of one State, the distant States would have it in their power to make head with fresh forces.'A. Hamilton (1952). The Federalist Papers, Number 28, In R. M. Hutchins, American State Papers (1st ed., Vol. 43, Great Books of the Western World, pp. 96-98) Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. (Original work published 1787) The French Revolution The right of revolution was also included in the 1793 preface to the French Constitution of 1793 during the French Revolution. This preface from 24 June 1793 contained a declaration of the rights of man and citizen including right to rebellion in §35: \\"When the government violates the rights of the people, insurrection is for the people, and for every portion thereof, the most sacred of rights and the most indispensable of duties.\\" American Civil War The inherent (rather than constitutional) right to revolt was cited in the year prior the civil war's start as justifying the secession of the Confederate States of America. (Iverson said this in 1860, 1861 is when Globe published it) Nature of the right =Individual or collective right= Although some explanations of the right of revolution leave open the possibility of its exercise as an individual right, it was clearly understood to be a collective right under English constitutional and political theory.See Christian G. Fritz, American Sovereigns: The People and America’s Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2008), 14 (noting that under English constitutional law the right of revolution \\"belonged to the community as a whole, as one of the parties to the original constitutional contract\\"). See also John Phillip Reid, Constitutional History of the American Revolution (4 vols., University of Wisconsin Press, 1986–1993), I:111 (identifying the collective right of the people \\"to preserve their rights by force and even rebellion against constituted authority\\"), III:427n31 (quoting Viscount Bolingbroke that the \\"collective Body of the People\\" had the right to \\"break the Bargain between the King and the Nation\\"). As Pauline Maier has noted in her study From Resistance to Revolution, \\"private individuals were forbidden to take force against their rulers either for malice or because of private injuries\\".Pauline Maier, From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain, 1765–1776 (Alfred A. Knopf, 1972), 33. Instead, \\"not just a few individuals, but the 'Body of the People' had to feel concerned\\" before the right of revolution was justified and with most writers speaking of a whole people who are the Public', or the body of the people acting in their 'public Authority', indicating a broad consensus involving all ranks of society\\".Maier, From Resistance to Revolution, 35–36. In the second of his Two Treatises of Government, John Locke quotes the jurist William Barclay as stating 'That particular men are allowed [...] to have no other remedy but patience; but the body of the people may with, with respect, resist intolerable tyranny, for when it is moderate they ought to endure it.'Barclay, Contra Monarchomachos, iii. 8. in Locke, Concerning Civil Government, Chapter XIX, Section 233, p. 79 =Right versus duty= Some philosophers argue that it is not only the right of a people to overthrow an oppressive government but also their duty to do so. Howard Evans Kiefer opines, \\"It seems to me that the duty to rebel is much more understandable than that right to rebel, because the right to rebellion ruins the order of power, whereas the duty to rebel goes beyond and breaks it.\\" Morton White writes of the American revolutionaries, \\"The notion that they had a duty to rebel is extremely important to stress, for it shows that they thought they were complying with the commands of natural law and of nature's God when they threw off absolute despotism.\\" The U.S. Declaration of Independence states that \\"when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government\\" (emphasis added). The phrase \\"long train of abuses\\" is a reference to John Locke's similar statement in the Second Treatise of Government, where he explicitly established overthrow of a tyrant as an obligation. Martin Luther King Jr. likewise held that it is the duty of the people to resist unjust laws. Preconditions =In philisophical discourse= Certain theories of the right of revolution impose significant preconditions on its exercise, sometimes limiting its invocation to the most dire circumstances. Aristotle insisted that 'men of rank' who 'excel in virtue have the best right of all to rebel'.Aristotle, Politics, Book V, Chapter 1 Although Plato argued that a dissident should openly criticise his nation's policies, 'provided that his words are not likely either to fall on deaf ears or to lead to the loss of his own life', he also stipulated against seemingly necessary violent insurrection: 'force against his native land he should not use in order to bring about a change of constitution, when it is not possible for the best constitution to be introduced without driving men into exile or putting them to death'.Plato (1952). The Seventh Letter (J. Harward, Trans.). In M. J. Adler (Ed.), Plato (1st ed., Vol. 7, Great Books of the Western World, pp. 800-814). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. (Original work published 1928) Thinkers often emphasise the great responsibility in taking hold of the right to revolution. Aquinas believed that would-be revolutionaries held no right to rebel against a tyrant if 'the tyrant's rule be disturbed so inordinantly that his subjects suffer greater harm from the consequent disturbance than from the tyrant's government.'Aquinas, Summa Theologica, Part II-II, Question 42, Article 2, Reply 3 Michel de Montaigne was equally cautious, warning that 'to establish a better regimen in the stead of that which a man has overthrown, many who have attempted it have foundered.'M. de Montaigne (1952). 'Of Presumption' (C. Cotton, Trans.). In W. C. Hazlitt (Ed.), The Essays of Michel Eyquem de Montaigne (1st ed., Vol. 25, Great Books of the Western World, pp. 318-319). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. (Original work published 1877) Even the American Declaration of Independence admits that 'Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes'.T. Jefferson, Declaration of Independence, p. 1 In Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes argued that, since they have consented to invest their sovereign with the right of rulership, monarchical subjects can only change rulers with the original sovereign's permission. He states that 'they that are subjects to a monarch cannot without his leave cast off monarchy and return to the confusion of a disunited multitude; nor transfer their person from him that beareth it to another man, or other assembly of men'.T. Hobbes (1952). Leviathan, Part II, Chapter XVIII. In N. Fuller (Ed.), Hobbes (1st ed., Vol. 23, Great Books of the Western World, pp. 101-104). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. Elsewhere he emphasises this point by saying that 'the commands of them that have the right to command are not by their subjects to be censured nor disputed.'Hobbes, Leviathan, Part II, Chapter XX, p. 112 John Locke believed in the precondition that the right of violent insurrection could only be retained by those challenging tyranny, stipulating 'that force is to be opposed to nothing but to unjust and unlawful force'.Locke, Concerning Civil Government, Chapter XVIII, Section 204, p. 72 The right of revolution only gave a people the right to rebel against unjust rule, not any rule: 'whoever, either ruler or subject, by force goes about to invade the rights of either prince or people, and lays the foundation for overturning the constitution and frame of any just government, he is guilty of the greatest crime I think a man is capable of'.Locke, Concerning Civil Government, Chapter XIX, Section 230, p. 78 In Two Treatises of Government, Locke discusses the pro-monarchy philosopher William Barclay's notions about the preconditions for the right of revolution against a monarch: 'First. He says it must be with reverence. Secondly. It must be without retribution or punishment; and the reason he gives is, \\"because an inferior cannot punish a superior.\\"' Locke disagreed with both these preconditions, explaining that it is impossible to strike against any opposition 'with reverence' and that an oppressor loses his superiority by being an oppressor.Locke, Concerning Civil Government, Chapter XIX, Section 235, p. 79 Elsewhere Barclay insists that a king must be dethroned as a precondition for the right of revolution against a monarchy: 'The people, therefore, can never come by a power over him unless he does something that makes him cease to be a king', which may only happen if the king tries to overturn his kingdom or make his rule dependent on force provided by another country.Barclay, Contra Monarchomachus, I. iii. c. 16. in Locke, Concerning Civil Government, Chapter XIX, Section 235-237, p. 80 In his treatise Politics, Aristotle disapproves of the Cretan constitution's provision for the aristocratic right of revolution against the Cosmi, the ten most important magistrates in the country: 'Worst of all is the suspension of the office of Cosmi, a device to which the nobles often have recourse when they will not submit to justice.' For Aristotle, this is evidence of oligarchical interference codified into supposedly constitutional, republican government.Aristotle (1952). Politics, Book II, Chapter 10 (B. Jowett, Trans.). In R. M. Hutchins (Ed.), Aristotle II (1st ed., Vol. 9, Great Books of the Western World, pp. 445-548). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. (Original work published 1915) In contrary to this view, the French Enlightenment thinker Montesquieu believed that this institution successfully hindered the abuse of power, thanks to the existing precondition of a powerful patriotism felt by the Cretans towards their island.Baron de Montesquieu (1952). The Spirit of Laws (T. Nugent, Trans.). In M. J. Adler (Ed.), Montesquieu (1st ed., Vol. 38, Great Books of the Western World, p. 54). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. (Original work published 1914) The presentation of the draft of the Declaration of Independence in John Trumbull's Declaration of Independence depicts another idealization of the exercise of the right of revolution. =During the American Revolution= In the American Revolutionary context, one finds expressions of the right of revolution both as subject to precondition and as unrestrained by conditions. On the eve of the American Revolution, for example, Americans considered their plight to justify exercise of the right of revolution. Alexander Hamilton justified American resistance as an expression of \\"the law of nature\\" redressing violations of \\"the first principles of civil society\\" and invasions of \\"the rights of a whole people\\".Alexander Hamilton, The Farmer Refuted (February 23, 1775), The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, I:136 For Thomas Jefferson, the Declaration was the last-ditch effort of an oppressed people—the position in which many Americans saw themselves in 1776. Jefferson's litany of colonial grievances was an effort to establish that Americans met their burden to exercise the natural law right of revolution. Certain scholars, such as legal historian Christian Fritz, have written that with the end of the Revolution, Americans did not renounce the right of revolution. In fact they codified it in their new constitutionsSee Christian G. Fritz, American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War (In Chapter 2, entitled \\"Revolutionary Constitutionalism\\", Professor Fritz notes that after the Revolution, \\"[i]ncreasingly, as Americans included it in their constitutions, the right of revolution came to be seen as a constitutional principle permitting the people as the sovereign to control government and revise their constitutions without limit.\\")(Cambridge University Press, 2008) at p. 25 and even today 35 constitutions of American states have the same or similar provisions on the right of revolution as in the preamble of the American Declaration of Independence.See Marsavelski, A. \\"The Crime of Terrorism and the Right of Revolution in International Law\\", Connecticut Journal of International Law, Vol. 28, at p. 270 For instance, constitutions considered to be \\"conservative\\", such as those of post-revolutionary Massachusetts in 1780, preserved the people's right \\"to reform, alter, or totally change\\" government not only for their protection or safety but also whenever their \\"prosperity and happiness require[d] it\\".Massachusetts 1780 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Art. 7. This expression was not unusual in the early American constitutions. Connecticut's 1818 constitution articulated the people's right \\"at all times\\" to alter government \\"in such a manner as they may think expedient\\".Connecticut 1818 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 2. Fritz, in American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War, describes a duality in American views on preconditions to the right of revolution: \\"Some of the first state constitutions included 'alter or abolish' provisions that mirrored the traditional right of revolution\\" in that they required dire preconditions to its exercise.Christian G. Fritz, American Sovereigns: The People and America’s Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War (Cambridge University Press, 2008), 24. Maryland's 1776 constitution and New Hampshire's 1784 constitutions required the perversion of the ends of government and the endangering of public liberty and that all other means of redress were to no avail.See Maryland 1776 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 4; New Hampshire 1784 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Art. 10. But in contrast, other states dispensed with the onerous preconditions on the exercise of the right. In the 1776 Virginia constitution the right would arise simply if government was \\"inadequate\\" and Pennsylvania's 1776 constitution required only that the people considered a change to be \\"most conducive\\" to the public welfare.Virginia 1776 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 3; Pennsylvania 1776 Constitution, Bill of Rights, Sec. 5. Natural law or positive law Descriptions of the Right of Revolution also differ in whether that right is considered to be a natural law (a law whose content is set by nature and that therefore has validity everywhere) or positive law (law enacted or adopted by proper authority for governing of the state). An example of the dual nature of the right of revolution as both a natural law and as positive law is found in the American revolutionary context. Although the American Declaration of Independence invoked the natural law right of revolution, natural law was not the sole justification for American independence. English constitutional doctrine also supported the colonists' actions, at least up to a point. By the 1760s, English law recognized what William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England called \\"the law of redress against public oppression\\".William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (4 vols., Oxford, 1765–1769, Facsimile ed., repr., 1979), I:238. Like the natural law’s right of revolution, this constitutional law of redress justified the people resisting the sovereign. This law of redress arose from a contract between the people and the king to preserve the public welfare. This original contract was \\"a central dogma in English and British constitutional law\\" since \\"time immemorial\\".John Phillip Reid, \\"The Irrelevance of the Declaration\\", in Hendrik Hartog, ed., Law in the American Revolution and the Revolution in the Law (1981), 72. The Declaration’s long list of grievances declared that this bargain had been breached.New Jersey 1776 Constitution, Preamble in Francis Newton Thorpe, ed., The Federal and State Constitutions Colonial Charters, and Other Organic Laws of the ... United States of America, V:2594 (noting that the King breached his contract with the people). This well-accepted law of redress justified a people resisting unconstitutional acts of government. Liberty depended upon the people’s \\"ultimate\\" right to resist. Unconstitutional commands breaching the \\"voluntary compact between the rulers and the ruled\\" could be \\"ignored\\" and arbitrary commands opposed with force.John Phillip Reid, Constitutional History of the American Revolution (4 vols., 1986–1993), III:140. This right implied a duty on the part of the people to resist unconstitutional acts. As Alexander Hamilton noted in 1775, government exercised powers to protect \\"the absolute rights\\" of the people and government forfeited those powers and the people could reclaim them if government breached this constitutional contract.Alexander Hamilton, \\"The Farmer Refuted\\" (February 23, 1775), The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, I:88. The law of redress had limits like the right of revolution under natural law. The law of redress, like the right of revolution, was not an individual right. It belonged to the community as a whole, as one of the parties to the original constitutional contract.See Reid, Constitutional History, I:111 (identifying the collective right of the people “to preserve their rights by force and even rebellion against constituted authority”), III:427n31 (quoting Viscount Bolingbroke that the \\"collective Body of the People\\" had the right to \\"break the Bargain between the King and the Nation\\"); Pauline Maier, From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain, 1765–1776, 33–34 (\\"Private individuals were forbidden to take force against their rulers either for malice or because of private injuries, even if no redress for their grievances were afforded by the regularly constituted government\\"). It was not a means of first resort, or response to trivial or casual errors of government.Some commentators endorsed the right of resistance if Parliament \\"jeopardized the constitution\\", but most identified the need for oppression and tyranny before its exercise. See Reid, Constitutional History, III:121, 427n31; Maier, Resistance, 33–35. Blackstone’s Commentaries suggested that using the law of redress would be \\"extraordinary\\", for example applying if the king broke the original contract, violated \\"the fundamental laws\\", or abandoned the kingdom.Blackstone, Commentaries, I:243 and 238. During the Stamp Act crisis of the 1760s the Massachusetts Provincial Congress considered resistance to the king justified if freedom came under attack from \\"the hand of oppression\\" and \\"the merciless feet of tyranny\\".Reid, Constitutional History, I:112 A decade later the \\"indictment\\" of George III in the Declaration of Independence sought to end his sovereign reign over the colonies because he violated the original constitutional contract.Reid, \\"Irrelevance of the Declaration\\", 84. As explained in legal historian Christian Fritz's description of the role of the right of revolution in American Revolution, American independence was justified by conventional theories under Anglo-American constitutional thought at the time about the people's collective right to cast off an arbitrary king. \\"Both natural law and English constitutional doctrine gave the colonists a right to revolt against the sovereign’s oppression.\\"Fritz, American Sovereigns, 14. But these understandings about the right of revolution on the eve of the American Revolution rested on a traditional model of government. That model posited the existence of a hypothetical bargain struck in the mists of antiquity between a king and a people. \\"In this bargain, the people were protected by the monarch in exchange for the people giving the king allegiance. This was a contractual relationship. American revolutionaries accused George III of breaching his implied duty of protection under that contract, thereby releasing the people in the colonies from their allegiance. The sovereign's breach of the hypothetical contract gave rise to the subjects' right of revolution—grounded on both natural law and English constitutional doctrine.\\"Fritz, American Sovereigns, 13. =Examples as positive law= Although many declarations of independence seek legitimacy by appealing to the right of revolution, far fewer constitutions mention this right or guarantee this right to citizens because of the destabilizing effect such a guarantee would likely produce. Among the examples of an articulation of a right of revolution as positive law include: Modern relevance Some have argued that because in modern times democratic governments can be overthrown by popular vote, the right of the people to remove the government has become embedded into the political system. In a study of the idea of rule by the people in the American Revolution and in early post-revolutionary America, legal historian Christian G. Fritz writes: However, events such as the Arab Spring provide evidence that the revolutionary period of history has not necessarily ended. This raises the question of the importance of right of revolution in 21st century. As terrorism is gaining recognition as a crime under international law, the concept of right to revolution is seen as a legal mechanism to distinguish terrorists from freedom fighters.See Aleksandar Marsavelski, The Crime of Terrorism and the Right of Revolution in International Law (In Chapter II.A.4., entitled \\"Criteria for the Use of Revolutionary Force\\" Marsavelski notes that there are certain limits to the right of revolution, guided by four principles: (1) principle of democracy, (2) principle of proportionality, (3) principle of just cause, and (4) principle of distinction), (Connecticut Journal of International Law, Vol. 28) at pp. 278–275.

The CNPRC is part of a network of seven National Primate Research Centers developed to breed, house, care for and study primates for medical and behavioral research. Opened in 1962, researchers at this secure facility have investigated many diseases, ranging from asthma and Alzheimer's disease to AIDS and other infectious diseases, and has also produced discoveries about autism. CNPRC currently houses about 4,700 monkeys, the majority of which are rhesus macaques, with a small population of South American titi monkeys. The Center, located on 300 acres (1.2 km²) 2.5 miles west of the UC Davis campus, is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Research program Scientists using the Center's facilities produce numerous papers annually detailing their investigations into human health issues. The center's research units are focused on four primary topics: Brain, mind, and behavior; infectious diseases; reproductive sciences and regenerative medicine; and respiratory diseases. Outreach Through their Affiliate and Pilot Research program, CNPRC supports visiting scientists by providing access to facilities and equipment. Similarly, the Center aids off-site researchers with veterinary services from in-house professionals. As with most federally funded research institutions, CNPRC provides educational outreach programs to the local community. They invite local elementary school students to learn about the research and animals through a standardized two-hour program. Children and their teachers learn some basics of primate biology, and about some of the primate-based biomedical research that is performed at the Center. Furthermore, the Center provides resources to elementary science teachers to promote biology, particularly primate biology and behavior, instruction. Incidents and controversies The California NPRC has been criticized for a number of issues related to its care of monkeys including several violations of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) that have resulted in the deaths of over a dozen animals in recent years. In 2013 a monkey was crushed by his cage door and in 2011 another monkey accidentally strangled himself with a bungee cord left in his cage. The center was cited by the USDA for AWA violations for failing to provide veterinary care to 19 monkeys who subsequently died between 2010-2009. In 2004 the center was fined by the USDA after seven monkeys died after the building overheated. Federal inspectors have also noted that as many as 50 monkeys were at times able to escape their enclosures. Critics of the center — who have called for the laboratory to be closed— say that the animals are treated poorly, subjected to cruel experiments and that more than 2,000 monkeys are kept in small indoor cages for their entire lives. The University has defended their care of the animals and the use of monkeys in medical experimentation. According to the center’s director, “To abandon primate research now would be the biggest hindrance to…medicine\\" claiming that the animals are needed for the development of new treatments for illnesses, a claim critics of the center dispute. In 2009 an outbreak of a monkey-killing cold virus identified as an adenovirus infected both monkeys and humans, with the sickness killing about a third of the 65 titi monkeys there. Only four of the 23 sick monkeys survived the illness. The research center was the site of this outbreak in what is being considered the first known case of an adenovirus jumping from monkeys to humans. There is a growing evidence of the contribution of CNPRC to the origins of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Evidence from the full length sequences has shown formation of a distinct cluster of SIVmac (the SIV strain that infect the old world monkeys in Asia) within HIV-2 and SIVmac phylogeny. It has been suggested that these monkeys could have been infected at CNPRC by captive Sooty Mangabey.

United States,. thereby replacing the Aguilar–Spinelli test for probable cause with the \\"totality of the circumstances\\" test. Facts and procedural history In May 1978, the Bloomingdale, Illinois Police Department received an anonymous letter. The letter stated: Detective Mader decided to follow up on the tip, obtaining further information that an \\"L. Gates\\" had purchased an airline ticket leaving from Chicago's O'Hare Airport and arriving in West Palm Beach, Florida. Working with the DEA, Mader was able to ascertain that Gates had boarded the plane and arrived in West Palm Beach. The DEA surveillance team determined that Gates had met a woman at a Holiday Inn room registered to Susan Gates and that the couple had gotten into a car together driving toward the Chicago area. They estimated the pair due back in Bloomingdale within 22 to 24 hours. Mader signed an affidavit laying down the events as they had unfolded, in addition to the anonymous letter. A judge of the Circuit Court of DuPage County issued a warrant. Upon the Gateses' arrival home, the Bloomingdale Police searched the car, recovering over 350 lb. of marijuana. A search of the Gateses' residence led to the discovery of additional marijuana and weapons. The Illinois Circuit Court decided that the search was unlawful based on the test established in the Supreme Court ruling in Spinelli v. United States. In essence, the affidavit did not provide enough evidence to establish probable cause, which led to the exclusion of evidence obtained on the basis of that warrant. This ruling was upheld by both the Illinois Appellate Courts and the Supreme Court of Illinois. The case was brought to the United States Supreme Court when the state and several amici curiae, friends of the court, asked them to review the decision. The main question that was presented was, \\"May a judge issue a search warrant on basis of partially corroborated anonymous informant's tip?\\" Holding The Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the Illinois courts. Justice William Rehnquist delivered the decision in favor of the State of Illinois. Justice Rehnquist stated: This rejected the Aguilar–Spinelli test and put in place a totality-of-the-circumstances standard. This was put into place because the court recognized that there was more evidence that the Gateses were involved in drug trafficking than just the letter standing alone. The court agreed that if the letter had just stood alone it would not be probable cause to get a warrant. The court also recognized that under the Aguilar–Spinelli two-pronged test, it would be very hard for the \\"reliability\\" prong to ever be satisfied from an anonymous tip so it therefore should be abandoned. This case is a landmark case in the evolution of probable cause and search warrants. In this case, the Supreme Court abandons the Aguilar–Spinelli test.  Dissent In dissent, Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, stated that \\"Only one of the cases cited by the Court in support of its 'totality of the circumstances' approach, Jaben v. United States, 381 U.S. 214 (1965), was decided subsequent to Aguilar. It is by no means inconsistent with Aguilar.\\"Gates, 462 U.S. at 286 (Brennan, J., dissenting). The dissent argued that the two pronged test of the honesty of the informant and the basis of knowledge was more protective of a citizen's rights, leaving less chance of a warrant being issued based upon the claims of a dishonest or unreliable \\"informant.\\" The dissenters believed that the Aguilar–Spinelli test was effective and should not have been replaced; that tests and laws that protect the rights of accused are too easily disregarded because the court and law enforcers are eager to prosecute suspects; and that the rights of the suspects also have to be protected. The dissenters stated,\\"By replacing Aguilar and Spinelli with a test that provides no assurance that magistrates, rather than the police, or informants, will make determinations of probable cause; imposes no structure on magistrates' probable-cause inquiries; and invites the possibility that intrusions may be justified on less than reliable information from an honest or credible person, today's decision threatens to obliterate one of the most fundamental distinctions between our form of government, where officers are under the law, and the police-state, where they are the law.\\" Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall also argued that the court did not show any persuasive reason for rejecting Aguilar and Spinelli, saying that the Court \\"reflects impatience with what it perceives to be overly technical rules governing searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment.\\" The dissenters supported their opinion by stating that, \\"Words such as practical, nontechnical, and common sense, as used in the Court's opinion, are but code words for an overly permissive attitude towards police practices in derogation of the rights secured by the Fourth Amendment.\\" In other words, taking away suspects' rights is not a correct way to enforce drug laws, even though drug trafficking is reprehensible. The dissenters would have affirmed the Illinois court and excluded the evidence. Concurring Justice White concurred in the judgment. He believed that in this case, the search and seizure was consistent with the Fourth Amendment. He believed that it was reasonable for the search of the Gateses' house. He stated that the exclusion of the evidence would have set the criminals free and it would not have served \\"any constitutional interest in securing compliance with the important requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\\" Justice White does not believe that the exclusionary rule should be used in any case where law enforcement officials reasonably believe their actions are consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Additional points In Illinois v. Gates, probable cause was achieved for the warrant under the new \\"totality-of-the-circumstances\\" standard because the investigation by DEA and Detective Mader would have, on its own, been probable cause for a search warrant. The Gateses' actions were suspicious because Florida is a known source of illegal drugs. Lance Gates' stay at a motel for one night and immediate return to Chicago suggests that he was not going for a vacation and also implies that he might be involved in something illegal. The Court, after having heard oral argument, furthermore requested in November 1982 that the parties and amici submit briefs on the broader issue of whether the exclusionary rule should be modified. When the opinion in Gates was rendered, however, the Court declined to rule on the issue, stating that the issue was \\"not pressed or passed upon below\\"meaning that it was not explicitly contested or argued in the state court, see Gates at 222. and that the exclusionary rule had become too difficult as an issue of great public importance to have been re-examined at the time.

It is the seat of the gmina administrative district called Gmina Izbica. It lies approximately south of Krasnystaw and south-east of the regional capital Lublin. It has a population of 1,933. History First mentioned in a church document from 1419, Izbica became a town in 1750, granted location privileges by Augustus III of Poland including the right of a Jewish settlement. Previously, the unconcluded city rights were issued in 1540 to Hetman Jan Tarnowski, who nevertheless gave them back to the crown. In 1662 some 23 Catholics lived there. In 1744 the Jews of Tarnogóra were brought to Izbica by Antoni Granowski who secured the town privileges for them independently of the already existing old settlement. A notable centre of trade and commerce, with time the town became a shtetl inhabited almost entirely by Polish Jews. In 1760 the city charter was reaffirmed. After the partitions of Poland in 1772 Izbica was annexed by Austria-Hungary and then purchased back from the Austrian government by Ignacy Horodyski in 1808. It remained part of the Duchy of Warsaw until the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte. Following the Congress of Vienna in June 1815 Izbica joined the Russian-controlled Congress Poland. The town was consumed by fire in 1825. In 1827 it had 51 houses and 407 inhabitants, all of them Jewish. By 1860 the population tripled to 1,450 Jews. In the 19th century the town was a notable centre of Hasidic Judaism, particularly thanks to the tzadik Grand Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner, who was a disciple of Mendel of Kotsk, and his son Grand Rabbi Yaacov Leiner who established the Hasidic dynasty of Ishbitz. The Grand Rabbi Yaakov Leiner was the author of Beit Ya'akov and father of the Tzadik Gershon Chanokh Leiner of Radzyn. After the January Uprising of 1863 against the Russian Empire, in which many of the local inhabitants took part, the town was stripped of its city rights in 1869 for punishment, and attached to the nearby commune of Tarnogóra. = Twentieth century= Following Poland's return to independence in the aftermath of World War I, the town grew significantly. Streets were paved and the marketplace rebuilt. According to 1921 census, Izbica had 3,085 inhabitants including 2,862 Jews, but by 1939, the total number grew to roughly 6,000 with 5,098 Jews. Izbica expanded particularly well because of the paved Lublin-Zamość thoroughfare, and a railway line to Zamość inaugurated in 1917. A black-marble cenotaph at the Jewish cemetery in Izbica Following the German and Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 during the opening stages of World War II the town was overrun by the Nazis. A number of prominent Polish Christians were arrested and murdered in the course of the AB Action against Polish intelligentsia.Kosiarski 2014, pp. 11-12. Jews were brutalized and robbed from the beginning of the occupation. The Germans resettled thousands of other Jews in Izbica beginning at the end of 1939. These included deportees from Biała Podlaska, Komarówka, Wohyń, and Czemierniki arrived. Almost the entire town was a ghetto. In the spring of 1941 in preparation for the attack on the Soviet lines in eastern Poland the German military storage facilities were set up in Izbica, and kept under heavy guard. The first mass deportation of ghetto inmates to the Bełżec extermination camp took place in mid-March 1942 conducted by the Reserve Police Battalion 101 with the aid of Ukrainian Trawnikis. During Operation Reinhard the ghetto served as a transfer point to the extermination camps in Bełżec and Sobibór for foreign Jews deported from Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and western Poland (Reichsgau Wartheland). In rounding them up in Izbica, typically the guards murdered dozens or hundreds in the town. Following the departures, Jews were hunted down and murdered in hiding places or in nearby fields. More than 20,000 Jews passed through the Izbica ghetto. Of all Jews of Izbica (over 90% of its prewar population), only 14 survived the Holocaust.Izbica - a story of a place by Foundation for the Preservation of Jewish Heritage in Poland.

Biography Born at Bagheria, Italy into a merchant's family, after having taken part in World War I Buttitta joined the Italian Socialist Party and around this time started to write poetry in Sicilian. His first volume of poetry published was Sintimintali (Sentimental), followed in 1928 by Marabedda. Soon after, Buttitta relocated to Milan, where he achieved some success in the commercial world while continuing to pursue his passion for literature. Due to his political leanings, he had to leave Milan during World War II; after which he joined the Resistance, was jailed by the fascists, and narrowly avoided the death penalty, before returning to Milan, where he spent time with Sicilian intellectuals such as Elio Vittorini, Salvatore Quasimodo and Renato Guttuso. In 1954 he published his new book of poetry, Lu pani si chiama pani (The bread is called bread), financed by the Italian Communist Party. In this volume he defined himself as Pueta e latru (Poet and thief), an allusion to the manner in which he would pass among the people like a thief, appropriating their feelings, leaving behind a sentimental thread. This was especially the case in relation to his nostalgia for his homeland, but there are also more socially-oriented themes, in particular, protests against the social situation of Italy and Sicily, such as A stragi di Purtedda (1947, about Salvatore Giuliano and the Portella della Ginestra massacre), and Lamentu per la morte di Turiddu Carnevale (1956, about Salvatore Carnevale - a Sicilian trade unionist from Sciara who was killed by the Mafia on 16 May 1955 - and his mother Francesca Serio). In 1964 cantastorie and folk singer-songwriter Otello Profazio set to music several Buttitta's poems in the album Il treno del sole (also known as Profazio Canta Buttitta). In 1972 Buttitta won the Viareggio Prize, for the volume Io faccio il poeta (I am a poet). His works have been translated into French, Russian and Greek. Buttitta, during his career as a poet, has never hidden his pride in being Sicilian, and his love for the language of the island. In one of his most famous poems, Lingua e dialettu (Language and dialect), he explicitly talks about language as a key issue for his people, and implores his fellows Sicilians to preserve their language: A contemporary Berlin-based Sicilian folk singer, Etta Scollo, celebrates the work of Sicilian folk singer and Buttitta associate, Rosa Balistreri, including rendering a version of Buttitta's The Pirates of Palermo: References  External links  *Selection of poems (in Sicilian, Italian, French and Spanish *Some English translations of some Buttitta poems Category:1899 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Italian male poets Category:Italian resistance members Category:People from the Province of Palermo Category:Sicilian writers Category:20th-century Italian poets Category:Sicilian-language poets Category:20th-century Italian male writers ","title":"Ignazio Buttitta"},{"id":"3438710","text":"This is a list of Spanish words of Celtic origin.

The long run contrasts with the short run, in which there are some constraints and markets are not fully in equilibrium. More specifically, in microeconomics there are no fixed factors of production in the long run, and there is enough time for adjustment so that there are no constraints preventing changing the output level by changing the capital stock or by entering or leaving an industry. This contrasts with the short run, where some factors are variable (dependent on the quantity produced) and others are fixed (paid once), constraining entry or exit from an industry. In macroeconomics, the long run is the period when the general price level, contractual wage rates, and expectations adjust fully to the state of the economy, in contrast to the short run when these variables may not fully adjust.Paul A. Samuelson and William D. Nordhaus (2004). Economics, 18th ed., [end] Glossary of Terms, \\"Long run\\" and \\"Short run.\\"  History  The differentiation between long-run and short-run economic models did not come into practice until 1890, with Alfred Marshall's publication of his work Principles of Economics. However, there is no hard and fast definition as to what is classified as \\"long\\" or \\"short\\" and mostly relies on the economic perspective being taken. Marshall's original introduction of long-run and short-run economics reflected the ‘long- period method’ that was a common analysis used by classical political economists. However, early in the 1930s, dissatisfaction with a variety of the conclusions of Marshall's original theory led to methods of analysis and introduction of equilibrium notions. Classical political economists, neoclassical economists, Keynesian economists all have slightly different interpretations and explanations as to how short-run and long-run equilibriums are defined, reached, and what factors influence them.Panico C., Petri F. (2008) Long Run and Short Run. Some of Marshall's original theories, adapted into new terminology and a variety of other analyses are some of the ways the Long Run and Short Run theories have been shaped. In: Palgrave Macmillan (eds) The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Palgrave Macmillan, London Long run Since its origin, the \\"long period method\\" has been used to determine how production, distribution and accumulation take place within the economy. In a long run, firms change production levels in response to (expected) economic profits or losses, and the land, labour, capital goods and entrepreneurship vary to reach the minimum level of long-run average cost. In the simplified case of plant capacity as the only fixed factor, a generic firm can make these changes in the long run: * enter an industry in response to (expected) profits * leave an industry in response to losses * increase its plant in response to profits * decrease its plant in response to losses The long run is associated with the long-run average cost (LRAC) curve in microeconomic models along which a firm would minimize its average cost (cost per unit) for each respective long-run quantity of output. Long-run marginal cost (LRMC) is the added cost of providing an additional unit of service or commodity from changing capacity level to reach the lowest cost associated with that extra output. LRMC equalling price is efficient as to resource allocation in the long run. The concept of long-run cost is also used in determining whether the firm will remain in the industry or shut down production there. In long-run equilibrium of an industry in which perfect competition prevails, the LRMC = LRAC at the minimum LRAC and associated output. The shape of the long-run marginal and average costs curves is influenced by the type of returns to scale. The long run is a planning and implementation stage. Melvin & Boyes, 2002. Microeconomics, 5th ed., p. 185. Houghton Mifflin.Boyes, W., 2004. The New Managerial Economics, p. 107. Houghton Mifflin. Here a firm may decide that it needs to produce on a larger scale by building a new plant or adding a production line. The firm may decide that new technology should be incorporated into its production process. The firm thus considers all its long-run production options and selects the optimal combination of inputs and technology for its long-run purposes.Melvin & Boyes, 2002. Microeconomics, 5th ed., p. 185. Houghton Mifflin. The optimal combination of inputs is the least-cost combination of inputs for desired level of output when all inputs are variable. Once the decisions are made and implemented and production begins, the firm is operating in the short run with fixed and variable inputs. Perloff, J, 2008. Microeconomics Theory & Applications with Calculus, p. 230. Pearson . . Another part of the development of planning what a firm may decide if it needs to produce more on a larger scale or not is Keynes theory that the level of employment(labor), oscillates over an average or intermediate period, the equilibrium. This level of fixed capital is determined by the effective demand of a good. Changes in the economy, based on capital, variable and fixed cost can be studied by comparing the long run equilibrium to before and after changes in the economy. Short run All production in real time occurs in the short run. In the short run, a profit-maximizing firm will: * increase production if marginal cost is less than marginal revenue (added revenue per additional unit of output); * decrease production if marginal cost is greater than marginal revenue; * continue producing if average variable cost is less than price per unit, even if average total cost is greater than price; * shut down if average variable cost is greater than price at each level of outputs Transition from short run to long run The transition from the short run to the long run may be done by considering some short-run equilibrium that is also a long-run equilibrium as to supply and demand, then comparing that state against a new short-run and long-run equilibrium state from a change that disturbs equilibrium, say in the sales-tax rate, tracing out the short-run adjustment first, then the long-run adjustment. Each is an example of comparative statics. Alfred Marshall (1890) pioneered in comparative-static period analysis.• John K.

The law is related to a positive slope of the short-run marginal-cost curve.While the law does not directly apply in the long run it is not irrelevant. The long run is the planning phase. A manager deciding which of several plants to build would want to know the shape of the SR cost curves associated with each of these plants. Marginal diminishing returns are related to the shape of the short-run marginal and average cost curves. Thus the law indirectly effects long-run decision making per R. Pindyck & D. Rubinfeld, 2001, Microeconomics, 5th ed., pp. 185-86. Prentice-Hall. Macroeconomic usages The usage of long run and short run in macroeconomics differs somewhat from the above microeconomic usage. John Maynard Keynes in 1936 emphasized fundamental factors of a market economy that might result in prolonged periods away from full-employment.Carlo Panico and Fabio Petri, 2008. \\"long run and short run,\\" Short- and long-period in Keynes, The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition. Abstract.John Maynard Keynes, 1936. The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, pp. 4–5. In later macroeconomic usage, the long run is the period in which the price level for the overall economy is completely flexible as to shifts in aggregate demand and aggregate supply. In addition there is full mobility of labor and capital between sectors of the economy and full capital mobility between nations. In the short run none of these conditions need fully hold. The price level is sticky or fixed in response to changes in aggregate demand or supply, capital is not fully mobile between sectors, and capital is not fully mobile across countries due to interest rate differences among countries and fixed exchange rates.N. Gregory Mankiw, 2002. Macroeconomics, 5th ed. pp. 240, 120, and 327–329. A famous critique of neglecting short-run analysis was by Keynes, who wrote that \\"In the long run, we are all dead\\", referring to the long-run proposition of the quantity theory of money, for example, a doubling of the money supply doubling the price level.J. M. Keynes, 1923. A Tract on Monetary Reform, p. 65. Macmillan.

Neodymium isotope ratios together with samarium-neodymium ratios are used to provide information on age information and the source of igneous melts. It is sometimes assumed that at the moment when crustal material is formed from the mantle the neodymium isotope ratio depends only on the time when this event occurred, but thereafter it evolves in a way that depends on the new ratio of samarium to neodymium in the crustal material, which will be different from the ratio in the mantle material. Samarium–neodymium dating allows us to determine when the crustal material was formed. The usefulness of Sm–Nd dating stems from the fact that these two elements are rare earth elements and are thus, theoretically, not particularly susceptible to partitioning during sedimentation and diagenesis. Fractional crystallisation of felsic minerals changes the Sm/Nd ratio of the resultant materials. This, in turn, influences the rate at which the 143Nd/144Nd ratio increases due to production of radiogenic 143Nd. In many cases, Sm–Nd and Rb–Sr isotope data are used together. Sm–Nd radiometric dating Samarium has five naturally occurring isotopes, and neodymium has seven. The two elements are joined in a parent–daughter relationship by the alpha decay of parent 147Sm to radiogenic daughter 143Nd with a half-life of 1.06 years and by the alpha decay of 146Sm (an almost-extinct nuclide with a half-life of 1.08 years) to produce 142Nd. (Some of the 146Sm may itself have originally been produced through alpha- decay from 150Gd, which has a half-life of 1.79 years.) To find the date at which a rock (or group of rocks) formed one can use the method of isochron dating. The Sm-Nd isochron plots the ratio of radiogenic 143Nd to non- radiogenic 144Nd against the ratio of the parent isotope 147Sm to the non- radiogenic isotope 144Nd. 144Nd is used to normalize the radiogenic isotope in the isochron because it is a stable and relatively abundant neodymium isotope. The Sm-Nd isochron is defined by the following equation: : \\\\left(\\\\frac{{}^{143}\\\\mathrm{Nd}}{{}^{144}\\\\mathrm{Nd}}\\\\right)_{\\\\mathrm{present}} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{{}^{143}\\\\mathrm{Nd}}{{}^{144}\\\\mathrm{Nd}}\\\\right)_{\\\\mathrm{initial}} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{{}^{147}\\\\mathrm{Sm}}{{}^{144}\\\\mathrm{Nd}}\\\\right) \\\\cdot (e^{\\\\lambda t}-1), where: : t is the age of the sample, : λ is the decay constant of 147Sm, : (eλt-1) is the slope of the isochron which defines the age of the system. Alternatively, one can assume that the material formed from mantle material which was following the same path of evolution of these ratios as chondrites, and then again the time of formation can be calculated (see #The CHUR model). Sm and Nd geochemistry The concentration of Sm and Nd in silicate minerals increase with the order in which they crystallise from a magma according to Bowen's reaction series. Samarium is accommodated more easily into mafic minerals, so a mafic rock which crystallises mafic minerals will concentrate neodymium in the melt phase relative to samarium. Thus, as a melt undergoes fractional crystallization from a mafic to a more felsic composition, the abundance of Sm and Nd changes, as does the ratio between Sm and Nd. Thus, ultramafic rocks have high Sm and low Nd and therefore high Sm/Nd ratios. Felsic rocks have low concentrations of Sm and high Nd and therefore low Sm/Nd ratios (for example komatiite has 1.14 parts per million (ppm) Sm and 3.59 ppm Nd versus 4.65 ppm Sm and 21.6 ppm Nd in rhyolite). The importance of this process is apparent in modeling the age of continental crust formation. The CHUR model Through the analysis of isotopic compositions of neodymium, DePaolo and Wasserburg (1976) discovered that terrestrial igneous rocks at the time of their formation from melts closely followed the \\"chondritic uniform reservoir\\" or \\"chondritic unifractionated reservoir\\" (CHUR) line – the way the 143Nd:144Nd ratio increased with time in chondrites. Chondritic meteorites are thought to represent the earliest (unsorted) material that formed in the Solar system before planets formed. They have relatively homogeneous trace-element signatures, and therefore their isotopic evolution can model the evolution of the whole Solar system and of the \\"bulk Earth\\". After plotting the ages and initial 143Nd/144Nd ratios of terrestrial igneous rocks on a Nd evolution vs. time diagram, DePaolo and Wasserburg determined that Archean rocks had initial Nd isotope ratios very similar to that defined by the CHUR evolution line. =Epsilon notation= Since 143Nd/144Nd departures from the CHUR evolution line are very small, DePaolo and Wasserburg argued that it would be useful to create a form of notation that described 143Nd/144Nd in terms of their deviations from the CHUR evolution line. This is called the epsilon notation, whereby one epsilon unit represents a one part per 10,000 deviation from the CHUR composition.Dickin, A. P., 2005. Radiogenic Isotope Geology, 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 76–77. Algebraically, epsilon units can be defined by the equation : \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{Nd}(t)} = \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac{^{143}\\\\text{Nd}}{^{144}\\\\text{Nd}}\\\\right)_{\\\\text{sample}(t)}}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{^{143}\\\\text{Nd}}{^{144}\\\\text{Nd}}\\\\right)_{\\\\text{CHUR}(t)}} - 1\\\\right] \\\\times 10\\\\,000. Since epsilon units are finer and therefore a more tangible representation of the initial Nd isotope ratio, by using these instead of the initial isotopic ratios, it is easier to comprehend and therefore compare initial ratios of crust with different ages. In addition, epsilon units will normalize the initial ratios to CHUR, thus eliminating any effects caused by various analytical mass fractionation correction methods applied. =Nd model ages= Since CHUR defines initial ratios of continental rocks through time, it was deduced that measurements of 143Nd/144Nd and 147Sm/144Nd, with the use of CHUR, could produce model ages for the segregation from the mantle of the melt that formed any crustal rock. This has been termed TCHUR. In order for a TCHUR age to be calculated, fractionation between Nd/Sm would have to have occurred during magma extraction from the mantle to produce a continental rock. This fractionation would then cause a deviation between the crustal and mantle isotopic evolution lines. The intersection between these two evolution lines then indicates the crustal formation age. The TCHUR age is defined by the following equation: : T_\\\\text{CHUR} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right) \\\\ln \\\\left[1 + \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac{^{143}\\\\text{Nd}}{^{144}\\\\text{Nd}}\\\\right)_\\\\text{sample} - \\\\left(\\\\frac{^{143}\\\\text{Nd}}{^{144}\\\\text{Nd}}\\\\right)_\\\\text{CHUR}}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{^{147}\\\\text{Sm}}{^{144}\\\\text{Nd}}\\\\right)_\\\\text{sample} - \\\\left(\\\\frac{^{147}\\\\text{Sm}}{^{144}\\\\text{Nd}}\\\\right)_\\\\text{CHUR}}\\\\right]. The TCHUR age of a rock can yield a formation age for the crust as a whole if the sample has not suffered disturbance after its formation. Since Sm/Nd are rare-earth elements (REE), their characterisity enables theitic immobile ratios to resist partitioning during metamorphism and melting of silicate rocks. This therefore allows crustal formation ages to be calculated, despite any metamorphism the sample has undergone. The depleted-mantle model Graph to show the depleted-mantle model of DePaolo (1981) Despite the good fit of Archean plutons to the CHUR Nd isotope evolution line, DePaolo and Wasserburg (1976) observed that the majority of young oceanic volcanics (Mid Ocean Ridge basalts and Island Arc basalts) lay +7 to +12 ɛ units above the CHUR line (see figure). This led to the realization that Archean continental igneous rocks that plotted within the error of the CHUR line could instead lie on a depleted-mantle evolution line characterized by increasing Sm/Nd and 143Nd/144Nd ratios over time. To further analyze this gap between the Archean CHUR data and the young volcanic samples, a study was conducted on the Proterozoic metamorphic basement of the Colorado Front Ranges (the Idaho Springs Formation).DePaolo, D. J. (1981). Neodymium isotopes in the Colorado Front Range and crust – mantle evolution in the Proterozoic. Nature 291, 193–197. The initial 143Nd/144Nd ratios of the samples analyzed are plotted on a ɛNd versus time diagram shown in the figure. DePaolo (1981) fitted a quadratic curve to the Idaho Springs and average ɛNd for the modern oceanic island arc data, thus representing the neodymium isotope evolution of a depleted reservoir. The composition of the depleted reservoir relative to the CHUR evolution line, at time T, is given by the equation :ɛNd(T) = 0.25 T2 – 3 T + 8.5. Sm-Nd model ages calculated using this curve are denoted as TDM ages. DePaolo (1981) argued that these TDM model ages would yield a more accurate age for crustal formation ages than TCHUR model ages – for example, an anomalously low TCHUR model age of 0.8 Gy from McCulloch and Wasserburg's Grenville composite was revised to a TDM age of 1.3 Gy, typical for juvenile crust formation during the Grenville orogeny.

The younger brother of another footballer, Klaus Allofs, he was a prolific goalscorer, having scored nearly 200 overall goals as a professional, always playing in the Bundesliga (a brief spell in France notwithstanding). Allofs represented West Germany at the 1982 World Cup. Club career Born in Düsseldorf, Allofs started his professional career aged 19, netting five goals in 17 contests with local giants Fortuna Düsseldorf. In his first year, he combined with sibling Klaus for 29 team goals (out of 70, league's third-best), as Fortuna finished seventh; he also played in five matches in the club's UEFA Cup Winners' Cup runner-up run, including the extra time final loss against FC Barcelona. In 1982, Allofs joined 1. FC Kaiserslautern, where he proceeded to score at an impressive rate (an average of 15 per season), although the team did not win any silverware. Subsequently, he moved to 1. FC Köln, rejoining with his brother in 1986–87, and being crowned the league's top scorer in his third season, with the team finishing second. Allofs wrapped up his career in 1992 at his first club, after an unassuming five-month stint in France with RC Strasbourg in the 1989–90 season. He stayed connected with Fortuna as a director. International career Allofs was an uncapped (an unused) member for West Germany in the 1982 FIFA World Cup campaign, which ended with runner-up honours.

Nelson in the 1920s. Many key archaeological sites from the Daxi culture, including the site at Daxi, were inundated or destroyed after the completion of the Three Gorges Dam. Material culture Daxi sites are typified by the presence of dou (cylindrical bottles), white pan (plates), and red pottery. The Daxi people cultivated rice extensively. Daxi sites were some of the earliest in China to show evidence of moats and walled settlements. The Daxi culture showed evidence of cultural interactions with the Yangtze River Delta region. The white pan artefacts from the culture were discovered at several Yangtze River Delta sites, including the type site of the Majiabang culture. Conversely, jade artefacts at Daxi sites show possible influence from the Yangtze River Delta region. The Daxi culture was followed by the Qujialing culture. People of Daxi Remains at Daxi were found to possess a high frequency of the Y-chromosome haplogroup O3d, which was not found at other prehistoric sites in China. This haplogroup is very rare in modern populations, with significant incidence only among Hmong–Mien (10%) and Austroasiatic (6%) populations. This might indicate that the people of Daxi were the ancestors of Hmong–Mien speakers, who subsequently migrated to the southwest.

It can also simply refer to an overheard conversation or anonymous sources of information, e.g. \\"I heard through the grapevine that Brad died.\\" Etymology In his autobiography Up From Slavery, Booker T. Washington says that slaves in the South kept up-to-date on current events by \\"what was termed the 'grape-vine' telegraph.\\" However, the New York Public Library contends that the phrase derives from the infamous Grapevine Tavern in New York City's Greenwich Village. During the Civil War it \\"...was a popular hangout of Union officers and Confederate spies... It was the ideal place to get news and information, or in the case of spies and politicians, the ideal place to spread rumors and gossip, leading to the popular phrase 'heard it through the grapevine'.\\"Village Landmarks - The Old Grapevine Tavern New York Public LibraryRepublic of Dreams: Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia, 1910-1960, Ross Wetzsteon, Simon & Schuster, 2002 The term gained a boost in popularity through its use in the Motown song I Heard It Through the Grapevine, a major hit single for both Marvin Gaye and Gladys Knight & the Pips in the late 1960s. Grapevine communication existed from the American Civil War to the First World War. It was coined this because of its nature of networking and reaching several at once; it causes the transformation of information between one individual and another.  Features  Flexibility: There is no formal control over grapevine, so it is more flexible than other forms of communication. This also makes it more vulnerable and problematic, as one cannot send a message to any specific person, but is rather putting faith in the vagaries of luck, having no idea how many people, or who, might eventually hear the communication. Compare this to sending a letter to a person, or telephoning them, for example. Rapid communication: It is faster than many other forms of communication such as the postal service or posting bulletins. No record: There is no evidence which can be documented for future reference. Distortion: The message which is passed gets distorted when it passes from one person to another. Spontaneity: Grapevine communication is spontaneous as it is passed automatically from the top level of the organization to the bottom level without any difficulty in delivering the message. It is used by management to spread information that either cannot be shared officially or in an attempt to test the waters. Cheap: It does not require any funds to take place. However, it can cost the speaker money if there are negative consequences of messages being garbled in transmission from person to person, or if they fail to receive the message through some misunderstanding, such as others believing they were already informed, since there is no control over or record kept of the communication and thus no idea of who heard it, when they heard it, or even what they actually heard.

He served as President of the University of Connecticut from 1985 to 1990 and as Professor of English and President of the University of Virginia from 1990 through 2010. Early life and career Casteen earned his B.A. (1965), M.A. (1966) and Ph.D. (1970) degrees in English from the University of Virginia. He was a medievalist and member of Phi Beta Kappa. From 1968 to 1969, he wrote a column called \\"Soundings\\" for the student newspaper, The Cavalier Daily, in which he wrote about the administration of the University, conducting sympathetic interviews with deans and defending the policies of the administration. Casteen began his professional career teaching English at the University of California, Berkeley, and later at the University of Virginia. From 1975 to 1982, he served as Dean of Admissions at the University of Virginia, resigning to serve as Virginia Secretary of Education under Governor Charles S. Robb from 1982 to 1985.University biography: Office of the President of the University of Virginia website. Retrieved on February 12, 2012. While serving as secretary, he taught as an adjunct professor at Virginia Commonwealth University.  President of the University of Connecticut  Casteen served as the eleventh president of the University of Connecticut from August 1985 through October 1990. In 1987, the university became the first public university in New England to ascend to the top-tier ranking of Doctoral Universities - Very High Research Activity (R1) of the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Enrollment rose from 23,878 students in 1985 to 26,478 in 1990, while the university's endowment rose from $2 million to $23 million. However, UConn continued to struggle with shrinking state support and deteriorating campus infrastructure. In 1988, the west side of the Homer Babbidge Library, which had opened in 1978 and was already experiencing structural deficiencies, was wrapped in safety netting to prevent bricks from falling off the facade and injuring passersby. The building remained wrapped in plastic—a state of affairs that historian Bruce M. Stave described as an \\"institutional embarrassment\\"—until 1998. Casteen lent his support to the University Library's successful efforts to fund the construction of the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center to house the university's archives and special collections. Starting in his second year, Casteen taught an introductory English literature class to stay in touch with his teaching roots. More intellectual and reserved than his gregarious predecessor, John A. DiBiaggio, Casteen was an aloof and demanding, albeit effective, president. In July 1990, Casteen submitted his resignation, effective October 1990, to accept the presidency of the University of Virginia. He had told many of his friends that leading his alma mater was his life's ambition. Casteen was succeeded as UConn president by Harry J. Hartley. President of the University of Virginia As president of the University, Casteen advocated increasing UVA's enrollment of women, minority, and economically disadvantaged students. In 2003, he directed the creation of AccessUVA, the University's full-need financial aid program. He presided over substantial growth, both financial and physical, at UVA.

It has three spillways across the Murrumbidgee River located in the South West Slopes region of New South Wales, Australia. The dam's purpose includes flood mitigation, hydro-power, irrigation, water supply and conservation. The impounded reservoir is called Lake Burrinjuck. It was designed by Lawrence Augustus Burton Wade (of the New South Wales Public Works Department)Article on Leslie Wade by C.J. Lloyd in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 12 (1990), Melbourne University Press. and built from 1907 to 1927 by Lane & Peters, Sydney. It is also known as Barren Jack Dam and Barrenjack. The property is owned by Department of Planning and Infrastructure (State Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Commenced in 1907, completed in 1928, and upgraded in 1957 and 1994, the Burrinjuck Dam is a major gated dam, located approximately south- west of Yass. The dam was built by the New South Wales Water, Conservation & Irrigation Commission and the NSW Department of Public Works for town water supplies, river flows and domestic requirements, irrigated agriculture, industry, flood mitigation and environmental flows. The Yass and Goodradigbee rivers also flow into the dam. Together with releases from Blowering Dam, on the Tumut River, Burrinjuck Dam also provides a regulated flow of water for the Coleambally and Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas. The dam divides the upper and lower catchment of the Murrumbidgee River and is the headwater storage for the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. History =Concept= The pastoralist Samuel McCaughey accumulated hundreds of thousands of hectares in the Riverina after owning his first property in 1864. He had an interest in water conservation that led him to construct a series of irrigation channels and steam pumps that were critical to the rice-growing activities in the area at the turn of the century. The New South Wales government liked his ideas so much they agreed to build a larger dam. =Initial construction= 220px Car built for the railway Construction commenced in 1907. Prior to about February 1911, the dam was known as Barren Jack, a corruption of the Aboriginal name of the locality. A narrow gauge railway was constructed from the New South Wales Government Railways' Main Southern Line at Goondah to bring materials to the site.Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, June, July & August 1987 pp122-142;158-168;176-189 The railway was about long, had a grade of 1 in 30 and some 90 foot-radius curves and took about 2 hours and 20 minutes to traverse. Burrinjuck Dam under construction, 1911 Delays were experienced throughout the construction period. Problems were found in part of the foundations of the dam wall in 1911, which led to a 12-month delay in completion of the first stage of the construction works. Delays were caused by World War I, construction of extensions to the spillways, and the fact that deep foundations were necessary. Flooding in July 1922 filled the reservoir to the record height of above sea level, or above the bed of the Murrumbidgee River at the dam wall. The flood waters tore through the unfinished southern spillway and fell to the river below, resulting in a massive fog which one journalist compared to that of Niagara Falls. The flood water came within of spilling into the finished northern spillway, which was being used as a storage site for sand and granite used in the dam's construction. Had the water entered the northern spillway, the construction materials, worth £25,000, would have been swept away. Another major flood in May 1925 far exceeded all previously recorded floods and resulted in the dam wall being overtopped to a depth of . Due to World War I, the dam was not completed until 1928. At the end of 1927, £1,712,730 had been spent on construction work, excluding the cost of the hydroelectric facilities. =Enlargement and remedial works= In 1937, it was discovered that the dam had developed a structural weakness that required remedial action. The weakness was not due to a design flaw per se; rather it was due to strains and stresses that were not scientifically understood at the time the dam was designed. The New South Wales Government brought in dam engineering expert Professor P.G. Hornell from Sweden to report on the defects that had developed in the dam. Apparently there were real fears of the dam wall bursting, so detailed plans were prepared for the evacuation of 20,000 people in the Murrumbidgee basin downstream of the dam in the event that the dam wall failed. The State Government played down these fears and felt that the evacuation plans would never have to be used. In the event of a catastrophic failure of the dam wall, it was anticipated that flood waters would reach Jugiong within an hour, Gundagai within 90 minutes, Wagga Wagga in six hours and Narrandera in 22 hours. Arrangements were made with police, the New South Wales Government Railways, the postal service, military and air force officials, radio stations, boat operators and local committees to be put into effect at a moments' notice. Remediation work was carried out between 1937 and 1957. The remediation work was authorised by the NSW Cabinet around January 1939, and at the time was anticipated to cost more than £1,000,000. The first stage of remediation works involved lowering the dam wall by and was estimated in 1937 to cost approximately £100,000. In 1941, the State Government appointed a committee to estimate the probability of the dam flooding. This flood probability was used by consulting engineers to estimate the cost of the remediation work. The engineers estimated the remedial work would cost £1,800,000 but according to Government experts this figure was likely to be substantially exceeded. In February 1951 a fire destroyed some of the workshops at the construction site. The compressing room, machine shop and first-aid surgery were the worst affected, and much of their contents were destroyed. The damage was estimated to cost between £50,000 and £100,000. Eventually, the remediation work strengthened and enlarged the dam wall, increased the discharge capacity of the spillways (to about twice the peak discharge of the 1925 flood), and increased the storage capacity of the dam from about to . A major flood in 1974 eroded unweathered granite from an unlined spillway discharge channel which then resulted in the destruction of a penstock to the Burrinjuck Power Station. The outlet valves of the dam were also destroyed during the same flood. These events prompted a review of the safety of the dam which recommended a new remedial works program. =Deaths= At 8 A.M. on Thursday morning of 19 October 1950, 9 men plunged to their deaths after a platform collapsed unexpectedly. The men were pulled into the spillway. They were pulling wires to open the southern spillway in order to alleviate floodwaters when the platform they were working from collapsed. 8 out of 9 of the men's bodies were found. Mr. Frank Lloyd Barton's body was found a mile down the river from the dam. The other 8 men were Frederick Rule, Frederick Basham, James Chant, James Fillery, Robert Elliott, Reginald Lippiatt, Peter Steinmanis, and Eugene Podusteanu. There was a 10th man, Bruce Grieves, working as well but he survived the accident because he had one leg off the platform and managed to pull back when the platform gave way. =Upgrade= In response to the 1974 floods, the Burrinjuck Dam Flood Security Upgrading project was undertaken to raise the existing dam wall by to its present height of and to install post-tensioned ground anchor cables to improve the security of the dam during major floods. At the time, the project was unprecedented in two respects: #the post-tensioning force required per metre length of dam crest and, #the intensity of the flood discharge over the unlined sections of the side channel spillways during the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF). The upgrading works were completed in 1999 at a cost of A$79.5 million. Climate Owing to the windward position of Burrinjuck astride the western slopes of the Brindabella Range, maximum temperatures are significantly cooler relative to altitude than regions on the eastern side of the range—i.e. the Australian Capital Territory; this difference in maxima is most pronounced in winter, jointly with much higher winter precipitation. Snow falls occasionally at the bottom of the valley, but it regularly occurs on the surrounding ranges and farmland above (such as at Wee Jasper); nearby Black Andrew Mountain (935 metres) and Mount Barren Jack (972 metres) overlooking the lake, are periodically snow-capped from June to August.  Description  Dam wall Burrinjuck Dam is situated on the Murrumbidgee River 60 km by road from Yass in southern New South Wales. The dam is part of a larger system of weirs and controls which include that of Blowering Dam and Berembed Weir. Burrinjuck Dam provides water supplies for the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area which has a combination of licensed agricultural, irrigation and stock use, with also town and domestic users. Apart from acting in a regulatory role the dam can also pass water through its 10 megawatt hydro-electric power station thus becoming a very fast and clean supply of electricity. The dam is a steel reinforced cyclopean concrete gravitation dam. Large rocks known as granite plums were mixed with cyclopean concrete during construction as a cost saving measure. The dam wall constructed with of concrete is high and long. The maximum water depth is and at 100% capacity the dam wall holds back of water at AHD. The surface area of the Lake Burrinjuck Reservoir is and the catchment area is . The three sector gates plus two side channel spillways are capable of discharging . Linked to the dam is a pump house, left and right spillways and a hydro electric power generation system.DLWC S170 Register Power station, 1928 =Power generation= The dam houses a hydroelectric power station and has three operational turbine generators, with a generating capacity of 28 MW of electricity; with a net generation of per annum.  Ecological impact  The unnaturally cold water released from the dam, up to colder than it naturally should be, is believed to have directly contributed to the disappearance of the freshwater catfish from the Murrumbidgee between Burrinjuck and Wagga Wagga.NSW Cold Water Pollution Interagency Group (2012) Cold Water Pollution Strategy in NSW - report on the implementation of stage one, NSW Department of Primary Industries, a division of NSW Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services, Sydney, New South Wales,  Heritage listing  The dam is an example of how applied modern technology has been used to meet the demand of an expanding rural area. The dam was part of a larger system of weirs and controls providing water for the government-sponsored Murrumbidgee Irrigation Scheme which enabled agriculture to expand in the area. It is the first major water storage built specially for irrigation purposes in NSW. The dam is also part of the New South Wales's first hydro-electric scheme. Burrinjuck Dam was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. It is listed as a National Engineering Landmark by Engineers Australia as part of the Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

(JNFL) (日本原燃 Nihon Gennen) is a nuclear energy company based in Rokkasho, Aomori Prefecture, Japan involved in the production of nuclear fuel, as well as the reprocessing, storage and disposal of nuclear waste. The mission of Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited is to establish a nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure in Japan. In uranium enrichment JNFL plans to provide for an ultimate capacity of 1,500 ton-SWU/year, enough to meet one third of the nuclear fuel needs of all nuclear power plants in Japan. The first generation Uranium Enrichment Plant in Rokkasho, Aomori operated 1992 to 2010 with a capacity of up to 1,050 ton-SWU/year, which is equivalent to the nuclear fuel used by 8 or 9 reactors at 1,000 MW-class nuclear plants. A second generation plant using centrifuges with composite carbon-fibre rotors started operating in 2011. Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant, Japan's first commercial reprocessing plant, began reprocessing in 2007, however complications have delayed full commercial operation until 2012. The plant has a design reprocessing capacity of 800 tonnes-U/year, enough to reprocess the spent fuel produced by 30 reactors at 1,000 MW-class nuclear power stations, though full capacity has yet to be realized. Responding to a December 1998 request from The Federation of Electric Power Companies, JNFL has been conducting technological studies regarding MOX fuel fabrication technology. According to the current plan, Japanese electric power companies will be implementing Plutonium-Thermal utilization (MOX) with 16 to 18 of the nuclear reactors operating in Japan. In late October 2010, work formally got under way on a 130 tonne/year J-MOX fuel fabrication plant, which is located on the same site as the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant. JNFL also operates low and high level nuclear waste long-term storage facilities which will accommodate 2,880 canisters of vitrified high level waste and the ultimate capacity of the Low- Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Center now under construction will be 600,000 m3.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross of Nazi Germany. Early career Infantes was born in Toledo on May 18, 1892. In 1907, aged 15, he entered the Toledo Infantry Academy where his classmates included Francisco Franco and Juan Yagüe. Graduating in 1910, he was commissioned as a lieutenant and was sent to join the Spanish African Army in Morocco. In 1912, at only 20 years of age, he received a meritorious promotion to captain during combat activity in the prolonged Rif War which lasted from 1909 to 1927. By 1928 he had achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel and in that year, following the end of the Moroccan war, was appointed a professor at the General Military Academy in Zaragoza by its new director, General Francisco Franco. Spanish Civil War He was in Madrid on July 17, 1936, when the military insurrection against the Republican government began and had to quickly escape to Burgos, where he joined the Nationalist forces under Franco. As a result, he was sentenced to death in absentia by the Republican government. During the war, he held various major military appointments including chief of general staff of the Castillian Army Corps during the Brunete offensive in July 1937 and the subsequent Battle of Teruel between December 1937 and February 1938. He then took over as colonel in command of the 5th Division of Navarre and received the Military Medal for his contribution to the ultimate success and victory of the Nationalist forces. In May 1940, a year after the civil war had ended, he was promoted to brigadier- general in command of the Army General Staff of Morocco and Military Region IV. Second World War After Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union in June 1941, Franco's government authorized the dispatch of a volunteer Spanish division under the overall command of the German Wehrmacht. This became the 250th Infantry Division (popularly known \\"Blue Division\\"), initially commanded by General Agustín Muñoz Grandes. The division was deployed within Army Group North under the overall command of Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, and engaged in several battles against the Red Army near Leningrad. However, despite being popular with his soldiers, Muñoz Grandes behavior began to show too much of a \\"pro-German slant\\" for Franco who, even in mid-1942, was preoccupied with the general direction and possible outcome of the war. Esteban Infantes was close friend of the Minister of War, General José Enrique Varela, and for several months he had been pressing for a transfer to a combat role with the Blue Division. However, Varela knew that there was only room for one brigade general and therefore Esteban Infantes could only be sent to the war zone in the Soviet Union as the commander of the division. The issue was finally resolved by Franco, who knew him well as a former colleague at both the Toledo and Zaragoza Academies. Franco viewed Esteban Infantes as a more moderate and diplomatic option compared to the more controversial Muñoz Grandes. Consequently, Esteban Infantes was dispatched to Germany where he was inducted into the Wehrmacht with the rank of Generalmajor and with the military oath being administered directly to Hitler at the Berghof. In December 1942, Esteban Infantes formally took command of the Blue Division. He faced a difficult situation replacing such a legendary and popular commander as Muñoz Grandes. The German generals also initially considered him to be too anglophile in his outlook but Esteban Infantes soon won their respect as he began to demonstrate his considerable skill as a great military planner especially in more counter-offensive situations that developed on the Eastern Front during 1943. Esteban Infantes faced a major Soviet attempt to break the siege of Leningrad in February 1943, when the 55th Soviet Army, reinvigorated after the Soviet victory at Stalingrad, attacked the Spanish positions at the Battle of Krasny Bor, near the main Moscow-Leningrad road. Despite heavy casualties, the Spaniards were able to hold their ground against a Russian force seven times larger and supported by tanks. The assault was contained and the siege of Leningrad was maintained for a further year. This victory established the reputation of Esteban Infantes both with his own soldiers and with the German general staff. The commander of 18th Army, Generaloberst Georg Lindemann, came to visit him and to congratulate him on this great feat. He was promoted to Generalleutnant and awarded the German Gold Cross. On October 3, 1943, he was finally also awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. After this, due to the course that the war was taking, Franco decided to withdraw the Blue Division and replace it with the smaller Blue Legion. Esteban Infantes was responsible for the establishment of this smaller unit before handing the command over to Oberst Antonio García Navarro. He then returned to Spain in December 1943, where he was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of Military Region IX. Later career After the war he occupied various posts including president of the Supreme Council of Military Justice, commander of the VII Military Region and head of Franco's military household before finishing his career as Chief of Central General Staff. He published his memoirs in 1958: \\"Blue Division: Spanish Volunteers in the Eastern Front.\\" He reaffirmed how proud he was to have participated in the Russian campaign and said that it served to counter the poor history of foreign Spanish military campaigns during the 19th century. His motto was: \\"Fighting is our glory! Our thought: Spain.\\" He died at home in Gijón on September 6, 1962, aged 70, after a long illness.

Purpose of framework Canada's boreal biome comprises forest, wetlands, mountains, rivers and lakes. It is still largely intact ecologically; along with the Amazon Rainforest and Siberian Taiga, it is one of the Earth's largest remaining intact wilderness regions. Abundant wildlife, including some of the world's largest populations of caribou, bears, wolves and lynx are present here. It provides the summer range for one third of North America's songbirds and three fourths of its waterfowl. The Boreal Forest Conservation Framework promotes conservation of the entire boreal region. This is critical to achieving the sustainability and well-being of communities that rely on it, and preserve its ecological values. If the framework is acted upon, it will position Canada as a world leader in forest and wetlands conservation and management. The Framework supports the spirit of a 1999 report of the Senate of Canada that recommended the following goals: *a long-range goal for the boreal of 20% in strict protected areas, *60% in conservation areas where maintaining ecological values was the primary goal, and *20% in intensive development. The Framework simplifies the Senate recommendation by redistributing the 60% identified for conservation equally between the protected areas other conservation areas. This allows for greater flexibility in decision-making with respect to protected areas. It also recognizes that to become truly sustainable, better land use practices will be needed in the connective lands and waters of the boreal between protected areas. The need for conservation planning This approach to large-scale conservation planning is supported by recent research in conservation biology and landscape ecology. Avoiding the effects of habitat fragmentation on wildlife populations requires conservation of at least 30-50% of original habitat. However, maintaining all ecological functions, natural services and cultural values will likely require conservation of significantly more than 50% of a landscape. This highlights the importance of protection and careful management of the remaining lands and waters. Moreover, given the importance of large-scale natural disturbances (such as fires) to ecosystem function of the boreal forest, planning must occur over very large areas.

It prefers to live in deserts with very little vegetation, where it blends in with the sandy soils. LeConte's thrashers are nonmigratory birds that reside in the same territory annually. Although the species has been decreasing in certain areas of its range, in particular California, it still is abundant enough to not be considered for vulnerable status. These birds are terrestrial and only fly occasionally. Both sexes are heavily involved in the nest building, incubating, and brooding process, though each alternates with primary responsibility of the tasks. LeConte's thrashers frequently compete with species such as the northern mockingbird, loggerhead shrike and greater roadrunner, as well as being potential prey for the latter. Taxonomy LeConte's thrasher is named after Dr. John Lawrence LeConte, an entomologist who eventually became president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. There are two subspecies: T.l. lecontei (Lawrence, 1851) - range is from southwestern United States (south central and eastern California, southwest Utah, and south central Arizona) to northwestern Mexico (north east Baja California and northwest Sonora). T.l. arenicola (Anthony, 1897) Rosalia thrasher; west coast of Baja California. T.l. arenicola has been proposed by the American Ornithologists Union as separate species, and treated as a separate species by other authors. and a name of Vizcaino thrasher if it becomes official. T.l. arenicola still is treated as a subspecies of lecontei by some authors, however. A proposed race T.c. macmillanorum only exhibits minor differences in plumage from T.l. lecontei (such as a darker crown and lighter flanks), but is not justified by biochemical or morphological grounds. One study suggested that the phylogeographic structure of the LeConte's is consistent with both its geographic distribution and genetics, with the Vizcaíno Desert in Baja California acting as a barrier initiating allopatric speciation. The two closest living relatives of LeConte's thrasher, the California thrasher and the crissal thrasher, form as the lecontei group. The similarities with these three species contrasted with other Toxostoma thrashers, in particular the sickle-shaped bill, longer legs and smaller wings indicated its adaption to a preference to running and digging for food. Description Leconte's thrasher illustration from Baird, 1905 LeConte's thrasher weighs from and are , and there is no sexual dimorphism within the species. Their wings are typical of birds that are sedentary, as they are short and rounded. There are noted differences among the subspecies. The crown, back, shoulders, and rump of T.c. lecontei possess a sandy pale-gray color. The primaries and secondaries are grayish brown. The rectrices are of a darker gray brown that contrasts with the plumage. Lores and ear-coverts are a mottled gray brown. The throat is an off-whitish color of a darker stripe. The chest and belly is puffy gray, and the vent and uppertail coverts are of a warmer tint in contrast to the palish chest and belly. The underwing is both gray and buff, with a brown-chestnut iris, a black-sickle shaped bill, and legs that are nearly black. T.l. arenicola has a darker chest and underparts and a shorter tail. In its juvenile stages, the thrasher is darker brown, and its feathers looser and fluffy in appearance, especially on the vent. Range and habitat This bird ranges from California as far west as the San Joaquin Valley through southern Nevada and southwestern Utah and central and southern Arizona, and is a resident species throughout its range. It resides in some of the harshest climates in its region, including the Sonoran Desert and the San Joaquin Valley, and where annual rainfall only averages 4 to 20 cm. The typical desert habitat consists of dunes, alluvial fans, and flat to gently rolling hills with shallow washes with sparse vegetation. The vegetation that it may utilize includes low vegetation such as saltbush, creosote, cholla cacti, and Mojave yucca. The range of altitude spans as low as 80 m below sea level (in Death Valley) to as high as 1,600 m, although 500 m above sea level is the average. It does not generally coexist with other thrashers due to its habitat, but does overlap breeding ranges and general habitat with the California thrasher in the higher desert regions of its range. The thrasher has had its population decline in certain regions of its range, notably the Coachella, Imperial and the San Joaquin Valley regions. Major reasons for its decline include urbanization, cultivation of land for livestock, oil and gas development, and fire with the increase of invasive species of grasses. Off- road vehicle use is a minor factor, while military operations conducted in the region have been considered, but not properly researched. However, there are apparent areas of suitable acreage for the thrasher that have not been utilized, and its population in undisturbed regions appear to be more stable. Although the thrasher has relatively small numbers on a worldwide scale for a passerine, and has been listed as a species of concern in the state of California, its large range overall justifies its status as least concern. Behavior Toxostoma lecontei This thrasher is a highly terrestrial bird, and is only seen flying when nest building or feeding its young. It runs at a surprisingly fast pace, even at speeds to outpace a trotting horse. When it does run, its tail is generally held upward, exposing its buffy crissum. LeConte's thrasher is a ground forager, and will dig small pits in leaf litter or soil to find its prey. It is a monogamous species, and generally seen in pairs, and juveniles may form small parties from two to eight birds. =Song= The song is a large, prolonged outpouring of warbled phrases that can be repeated two or several times and can be heard from considerable distances, which is typical of the genus Toxostoma. The song starts softly, then increases in volume, and has a more measured delivery than that of the crissal thrasher. The song bouts have been compared to curve-billed thrashers, but are higher pitched and marked by clear intervals. The song is generally uttered from an exposed perch, and is generally heard either in the morning or in the evening, though it has been heard at night. Females also sing on occasion, in a manner similar to juvenile male LeConte's. Calls include a short whistle note suuuweeee, hew-eep or pooh-ip, along with the double-noted whistling distress call. =Diet= The diet is omnivorous, and includes arthropods such as beetles, scorpions, spiders, grasshoppers, butterflies, moth larvae, and small lizards and snakes. Eggs are also part of its diet, including those of its own species. Plant consumption includes seeds and berries. The LeConte's conserve water as an adaptation to their arid habitat and obtain what they need from their food. While they generally do not have to drink, there has been one recorded instance of such an event. =Breeding= The singing season typically begins in mid-autumn and peaks around late December and early January, when nest building begins. The nests are generally of a bulky build, with outer layer of twigs, a middle layer of twigs, grasses, and rootlets, and an inner layer of insulating materials such as fuzzy plant seeds, leaves or flowers. Feathers and artificial material have been used as well, but these instances are rare. Dense and thorny shrubs such as the saltbush are preferred sites, although artificial sites such as abandoned vehicles and heights as high as 2.4 m with smoke trees have been used when the general distance of nests off the ground are usually only half as low. Both sexes take part in nest building, although the participation of the male varies. Nest fidelity is generally observed with the species until one of the mates die. The territories of the nesting pairs may be adjacent to one another due to food sources, although conflicts are rarely had. LeConte's thrasher illustration from Merriam, 1895 The egg dates generally range from February to the end of May in California, and in the Sonoran region from December to April, though dates have been listed as early as late January and as late as the latter part of June. The clutch size ranges from 2 to 5 eggs, but the number is generally 3–4. The eggs are large-sized and bluish green that may either contain various degrees of brown spotting or no markings. The eggs are generally laid once a day and incubation begins once the last egg is laid, and lasts from 14 to 20 days. The male generally provides the food for the female, as well as food for the young during the brooding stages. The female is more likely to incubate during at night, however. If the nest is destroyed or preyed upon, a new one is generally built, as they can have up to three broods during the reproductive season. The young are fed by both parents during the fledgling period, which can span from 12 to 20 days, and can be continued to be fed after for 15 to 18 days afterward, especially if the female is brooding the next clutch. At around 30 days old, the fledglings disperse, and may form small groups. Predators and competitors These birds defend their territory year-round, but males are generally less territorial in the summer months during molting and the fledgling dispersals. Males may give a visual display to intruding males by employing a head down position, showing off their crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) while simultaneously disappearing into a bush head first in a slow motion. Their territories are most actively defended from early December to early February. Potential competitors for food and nesting sites include the northern mockingbird, sage thrasher, loggerhead shrike, house finch, black-throated sparrow, cactus wren, and the greater roadrunner. They may share the same nesting shrub or tree with their competitors, such as the loggerhead shrike. They are rarely victims of cowbird parasitism. LeConte's thrasher has been recorded being victimized by the bronzed cowbird in a least one instance, but not by the brown-headed cowbird. However, when 11 brown-headed cowbird eggs were placed in the thrasher's nest in an experiment, they were accepted. Some of the predators of the eggs, young, and adults of this species include birds of prey, greater roadrunners, antelope squirrels, domestic cats, dogs, coyotes, and various snake species.

In the US, such a center is referred to as an air route traffic control center (ARTCC). A center typically accepts traffic from, and ultimately passes traffic to, the control of a terminal control center or another center. Most centers are operated by the national governments of the countries in which they are located. The general operations of centers worldwide, and the boundaries of the airspace each center controls, are governed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In some cases, the function of an area control center and a terminal control center are combined in a single facility. For example, NATS combines the London Terminal Control Centre (LTCC) and London Area Control Centre (LACC) in Swanwick, UK. FAA definition Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center, United States The United States Federal Aviation Administration defines an ARTCC as: An ARTCC is the U.S. equivalent of an area control centre (ACC). There are twenty-one ARTCCs, located in eighteen states. Subdivision of airspace into sectors The flight information region controlled by a center may be further administratively subdivided into areas comprising two to nine sectors. Each area is staffed by a set of controllers trained on all the sectors in that area. Sectors use distinct radio frequencies for communication with aircraft. Each sector also has secure landline communications with adjacent sectors, approach controls, areas, ARTCCs, flight service centers, and military aviation control facilities. These landline communications are shared among all sectors that need them and are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Aircraft passing from one sector to another are handed off and requested to change frequencies to contact the next sector controller. Sector boundaries are specified by an aeronautical chart. Center operations Controllers at work at the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center, United States Air traffic controllers working within a center communicate via radio with pilots of instrument flight rules aircraft passing through the center's airspace. A center's communication frequencies (typically in the very high frequency aviation bands, using amplitude modulation (AM) 118 MHz to 137 MHz, for overland control) are published in aeronautical charts and manuals, and are also announced to a pilot by the previous controller during a hand-off. Most VHF radio assignments also have a UHF (225 to 380 MHz) paired frequency used for military flights. In addition to radios to communicate with aircraft, center controllers have access to communication links with other centers and TRACONs. In the United States, centers are electronically linked through the National Airspace System, which allows nationwide coordination of traffic flow to manage congestion. Centers in the United States also have electronic access to nationwide radar data. Controllers use radar to monitor the progress of flights and instruct aircraft to perform course adjustments as needed to maintain separation from other aircraft. Aircraft with center contact can be readily distinguished by their transponders. Pilots may request altitude adjustments or course changes for reasons including avoidance of turbulence or adverse weather conditions. Controllers can assign routing relative to location fixes derived from latitude and longitude, or from radionavigation beacons such as VORs. Typically, centers have advance notice of a plane's arrival and intentions from its pre-filed flight plan. Oceanic air traffic control Some centers have ICAO-designated responsibility for airspace located over an ocean such as ZNY and ZOA, the majority of which is international airspace. Because substantial volumes of oceanic airspace lie beyond the range of ground-based radars, oceanic airspace controllers have to estimate the position of an airplane from pilot reports and computer models (procedural control), rather than observing the position directly (radar control, also known as positive control). Pilots flying over an ocean can determine their own positions accurately using the Global Positioning System and can supply periodic updates to a center. A center's control service for an oceanic flight information region may be operationally distinct from its service for one over land, employing different communications frequencies, controllers, and a different ICAO code. Pilots typically use high frequency radio instead of very high frequency radio to communicate with a center when flying over the ocean, because of HF's relatively greater propagation over long distances. Military aircraft, however, are typically installed with ARC-231 SATCOMs that allow over-the-horizon communication.https://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/arc231 World ACCs *List of area control centers See also *National Track Analysis Program References Category:Air traffic control ","title":"Area control center"},{"id":"3438854","text":"A United States Coast Guard cutter with one of the force's maritime patrol aircraft and a helicopter Maritime patrol is the task of monitoring areas of water. Generally conducted by military and law enforcement agencies, maritime patrol is usually aimed at identifying human activities. Maritime patrol refers to active patrol of an area, as opposed to passive monitoring systems such as sound-detection fixtures or land-based spotters. A patrol consists of a ship, submarine, aircraft or satellite examining the patrolled area and seeking out activities to be identified and reported. Maritime patrol is critical in wartime situations for navies to locate enemy forces to engage or defend against. Peacetime patrols are important for interdiction of criminal activities and for ensuring legal use of waters. Maritime patrols can be conducted by surface ships and submarines, by aircraft (e.g. MPA) and other aerial vehicles, and even by satellites. Human spotting remains an important part of detecting activity, but increasingly electronic systems are used. Several types of maritime patrol missions exist: * Military: Navies and air forces employ patrols to locate and identify enemy or potential enemy ships and submarines. The patrols report these findings to combat vessels which can then take appropriate action. Characteristics to identify are the numbers and types of vessels, as well as bearing and speed information to assist tracking the units. Anti-submarine patrols often deploy sonobuoys or other devices to assist with tracking. During peacetime, patrols are maintained by military forces for practice and to prevent surprise deployments by enemies. * Law enforcement: Countries with extensive coastlines are vulnerable to those entering or exiting the country undetected. In particular smuggling is often carried out over water. Law enforcement agencies often employ maritime patrols to assist interception of such activities. * Economic: Water areas, in particular those close to the coast, are areas of economic activity. Not only shipping but also fishing and even tourism are important economic activities to coastal countries. Patrolling these waters falls to maritime patrols. Such patrols may seek fishing vessels which are outside of prescribed fishing grounds (often from neighboring countries' fleets) or which are not adhering to regulations. Additionally, patrols may assist customs agencies by monitoring commercial shipping traffic in controlled waters. * Coast defence: Coast defence identifies and intercepts threats to coastal areas. This may include preventing infiltrations or discouraging enemy surveillance of coastal installations. Law enforcement patrols aim at preventing criminals from reaching the shoreline. * Rescue: Although not necessarily a primary mission of maritime patrol assets, they are often used to assist in maritime rescue operations, both for searching and often to extract survivors too.

As glycerol contains both primary and secondary alcohol groups two different types of monoglycerides may be formed; 1-monoacylglycerols where the fatty acid is attached to a primary alcohol, or a 2-monoacylglycerols where the fatty acid is attached to the secondary alcohol. Synthesis Monoglycerides are produced both biologically and industrially. They are naturally present at very low levels (0.1-0.2%) in some seed oils such as olive oil, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil. They are biosynthesized by the enzymatic hydrolysis of triglycerides by lipoprotein lipase and the enzymatic hydrolysis of diglycerides by diacylglycerol lipase; or as an intermediate in the alkanoylation of glycerol to form fats. Several monoglycerides are pharmacologically active (e.g. 2-oleoylglycerol, 2-arachidonoylglycerol). Industrial production is primarily achieved by a glycerolysis reaction between triglycerides and glycerol. The commercial raw materials for the production of monoacylglycerols may be either vegetable or animal fats and oils. Uses Monoglycerides are primarily used as surfactants, usually in the form of emulsifiers. Together with diglycerides, monoglycerides are commonly added to commercial food products in small quantities as \\"E471\\" (s.a. Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids), which helps to prevent mixtures of oils and water from separating. The values given in the nutritional labels for total fat, saturated fat, and trans fat do not include those present in mono- and diglycerides as fats are defined as being triglycerides. They are also often found in bakery products, beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, shortening, whipped toppings, margarine, and confections. In bakery products, monoglycerides are useful in improving loaf volume and texture, and as antistaling agents. Monoglycerides are used to enhance the physical stability towards creaming in milk beverages.

It was in limbo during the Second World War; however, following the end of hostilities, a facility was acquired in Borehamwood, which remained in use until it was closed in 1970. Pre-war The films produced during the initial period at Denham were A Yank at Oxford (1938), The Citadel (1938), Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939) and Busman's Honeymoon (US: Haunted Honeymoon, 1940). The first production head was Michael Balcon. However, he left after a single film and was replaced by Victor Saville. The subsidiary was in abeyance during the war. Meanwhile, Amalgamated Studios Ltd constructed a large studio on the north side of Elstree Way between 1935 and 1937. A January 1937 deal for eight films to be made for the American studio Columbia Pictures soon collapsed. The company was unable to meet the cost of building work, and sold the facility to the Rank Organisation, which was not interested in using the studios itself, but wanted to stop John Maxwell's rival British International Pictures (BIP) from being able to compete more effectively with Rank's recently opened Pinewood Studios. During the war, the studios were leased from Rank by the Ministry of Works which used them for storage.Warren, p.83 Post-war Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased the former Amalgamated Studios, Borehamwood in April 1944. MGM's Edward, My Son (1949), with Spencer Tracy and Deborah Kerr, was the first film to be produced at the studio. Films made at the MGM-British studios for the parent company include Ivanhoe (1952) and The Dirty Dozen (1967). Production designer Alfred Junge's castle setting for the former was to dominate the Borehamwood skyline for some years afterwards. The facilities were hired by other companies; 20th Century Fox shot the films Anastasia (1956) and The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958) at Borehamwood. When Ealing Studios sold its own studios in 1956, they moved production of their last few films to MGM-British (with their logo now reading Ealing Films rather than Ealing Studios). Lew Grade's ITC used it for television series, including The Prisoner (1967–68). One of the last films shot there, MGM's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), has been cited as one of the primary causes behind the closure of the studio, owing to Stanley Kubrick's production occupying more and more of the available studio space—eventually using all of it—for almost two years. The studio was in operation until 1970, one of the last productions being the UFO television series. At that time, MGM made a production and distribution deal with EMI, and began to use its facility (commonly known as Elstree Studios, Shenley Road) becoming MGM-EMI, an arrangement which only lasted until 1973, with MGM having a financial interest in only a few films.

When logs are sold, in order to determine the basis for a sale price in a standard way, the logs are \\"scaled\\" which means they are measured, identified as to species, and deductions for defects assigned to produce a net volume of merchantable wood. There are several different scales or rules that are used to determine the volume of wood. Scribner Decimal C rule is based on diagrams of circles that show the amount of boards that will be utilized from diameters of logs. Cubic rule, often called Metric in Canada, determines the cubic volume of the log material. The logs are recorded as gross scale (actual log measurements, length and diameter) and net scale (volume after deductions for defects are taken out). This occupation is usually performed by a third party organization qualified to \\"scale\\" government timber. Since internal defects are determined by external indications, scaling is not an exact science and is subject to interpretation of log scaling rules. The log scaler is subject to random \\"check scales\\" in which another scaler rescales exactly the same logs and the results are compared. The log scaler must be within + or - 1% of the gross scale and + or - 2% of the net scale to keep their certification to scale. The scale is used for payment, quality control and inventory purposes. Historical methods Historically, in the Pacific Northwest, logs were first sold after they were delivered to the water and rafted to the mill. Bundle rafts have bundles of logs that are tightly fastened together and some logs are well below the water line. Consequently, log scalers would walk the rafts and measure and grade the logs in the water. When logging was done by hand, the fallers and buckers were often paid on a piecework basis so the individual workmen's production was scaled daily as well. Presently, few logs are ever rafted. Ramp scaling Ramp Scale at Mist, Oregon A log scaling method that has been popular since the adaptation of trucks to haul logs has been the 'ramp scale'. In this approach, the log truck is driven beside a scale ramp which is simply an elevated platform, and from there the log scaler climbs around on the truck and on the load and measures and grades the logs. Although the ramp is typically operated by the scaling bureau, it may be located with a sawmill yard that is buying the logs or it may be at some other convenient location. Depending on the location, the ramp may scale logs for a single mill, or the ramp may be located so that logs scaled may proceed to multiple destinations. The photo at the right shows two trucks at a typical Pacific Northwest bureau scale ramp. Ramp scaling is often used where space is limited, speed is important, or the logs are of relatively low value. Assessing the grade of each log involves inspecting it for defects, but when a given log is situated in the middle of a truckload of logs it may be difficult to examine it. Rollout scaling Rollout scaling in Oregon Log yard The preferred method of scaling, particularly when high-value logs are involved, is the 'roll out' method. In this process, the logs are unloaded from the truck and rolled out on the ground or on skids a single layer deep, so that the scaler can then see a good part of every log in order to assist in determining the number and size of defects such as bend or rot. Rollout scaling must be done where heavy machinery is available to handle the logs, and requires the space to do the rollout as well as the time and expense of the extra handling. Rollout scaling can be more efficient (at least for the trucks) as the trucks do not have to wait to be scaled and can be unloaded and leave immediately. This is in contrast with the ramp scale, where the truck must wait until the scaling is complete. In some jurisdictions, there are still places where the logs arrive via railroad car, and here they can be left for rollout scaling. Timber cruisers also estimate the volume of timber, for example in a timber sale where the timber is sold on the stump, and can see the logs and where limbs grew on a tree, especially the lower logs in a tree which have the most volume and often the best grade of log and thus often the most value, better than a scaler. However, rollout scaling helps the scaler do this better than truck scaling or, in the Canadian province of British Columbia, in a log raft. The better the wood quality and the bigger the size of the logs, the better it is to scale logs when they are \\"rolled out\\". Standing wood scaling Method of standing wood scaling is used for high- value logs volume measurement or for creation of allometric equations. measured by special scope) allows obtaining accurate stem volume.

He was a high-note specialist for Jimmie Lunceford's band, and later played in several other big bands. Early life Webster was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on August 24, 1909. He attended Fisk University. Later life and career Webster became a professional musician around 1927. He played in bands led by George E. Lee (1927), Bennie Moten (1927–28), Paul Banks (1930), and Jap Allen (around 1930). He joined Jimmie Lunceford's band in 1931, then moved to Tommy Douglas (around the same year), and vocalist Eli Rice (1933–34). Webster returned to Lunceford in 1935, and became known as a high-note specialist. He appeared on film in Jimmie Lunceford and His Dance Orchestra, which was made in 1936. After leaving Lunceford in 1944, he joined Cab Calloway's band, and played with them on and off into the 1950s. He was part of other bands in the same period, including those led by Charlie Barnet (1946–47, and 1952–53), Sy Oliver (1947), Eddie Wilcox, and Count Basie (1950). He played part-time from 1953 into the 1960s. Webster died in New York on May 6, 1966.

Description The bird grows to 32 cm (12.5 inches), and has a deeply curved bill. The eyes are dull yellow. Bird expert Roger Tory Peterson described its singing as sweeter and less spasmodic than other thrashers.Peterson's Field Guide to Birds of North America, page 322 It can be found near desert streams in dense underbrush, mesquite thickets, willows, scrub oak, high elevations in manzanita, and in the low desert near canyon chaparral. The bird seldom flies in the open.The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds, Western Region, pg. 523 The crissal thrasher rarely flies, preferring to walk or run around its territory and will mostly run for cover when disturbed by a potential predator. The bird's name is derived from the characteristic bright coloring, in contrast to the balance of its plumage, of the area between its tail and vent—a region known as the ' in bird terminology. History In the early years of the study of the birds of western North America, this species was confused with the California thrasher (Toxostoma redivivum), to which it is closely related. Descriptions of T. redivivum in John Cassin's 1856 book Illustrations of the Birds of California, Texas, Oregon, British, and Russian AmericaJohn Cassin (1856), Illustrations of the Birds of California, Texas, Oregon, British, and Russian America. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott & Co. Pages 260-264. led later ornithologists to conclude that at least three of the birds described were actually the crissal thrasher. When an army surgeon working in New Mexico sent Cassin specimens of a bird that he believed to be the California thrasher, Cassin sent the specimens to Spencer Baird at the Smithsonian Institution. Baird determined that it was not a California thrasher and published his findings in 1858, identifying the crissal thrasher as a new species. Printer's errors in Baird's 1858 publication led to longstanding confusion and contention over the naming of the crissal thrasher. As printed, Baird's publication identified the new species as Toxostoma dorsalis, because the printer had switched the species name of the new thrasher with the species name of a new junco species, Junco dorsalis. Baird arranged for the error to be corrected, recording the name as T. crissalis the following month. Thereafter, the T. crissalis name was accepted and used until 1920, when ornithologist Harry Oberholser published a note asserting that T. dorsalis must be used instead because it had publication priority over T. crissalis, even though the original publication had been a mistake and had been quickly corrected.H. C. Oberholser (1920), \\"Toxostoma crissalis versus Toxostoma dorsalis,\\" The Auk, Vol. 37, page 303. As a result, the T. dorsalis epithet appeared in ornithological literature until 1983, when the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature formally restored Baird's intended name of T. crissale. Nest The crissal thrasher builds its nests in dense shrubs about 3 to 8 feet up, typically under a large branch for protection both from other birds and the sun. The male and female cooperate in building the cup- shaped nest, which is built from twigs and lined with finer vegetation. The eggs, which are blue in color and lack spots (this is the only species of thrasher to lay eggs without spots), are laid in clutches of 2 to 3 eggs and incubated for about 2 weeks, with both the male and female taking turns on the nest. The young are fledged 11 to 13 days after they hatch. The chick is paler and duller than the adult, with a browner undertail. Diet The species is an omnivore, eating both insects and spiders, and seeds and fruits. The crissal thrasher is mainly a ground feeder, using its long bill to probe for its prey amongst the leaf litter, particularly under shrubs. References Further reading =Book= * Cody, M. L. 1999.

Born in Horsforth, West Riding of Yorkshire, he made his film debut in 1932, and played either first or second film leads throughout his career. He appeared in films from the 1930s to the 1970s. Life and career =Early life= On 11 November 1911, Reginald Lawrence Knowles was born in Milton College, Horsforth. His father, Lawrence Knowles, was age 22 and was working as an accountant clerk. Reginald's mother, Nellie Knowles, was age 19 and working as a dressmaker. The couple had only been married for under a year at the time of Knowles birth. He also had two brothers, Phillip and William Knowles. From the age of 14, Knowles left school and was being groomed to take his place alongside other relatives in the family bookbinding business in Leeds. However, Knowles was persistent in following his dreams as an actor and ran away from home at the age of 14, but was brought back. He ran away again in later years, which proved to be more successful. =British Acting Career= Knowles began his acting career with the British sound films early in 1932, calling himself, Patric Knowles. He made his film debut in Men of Tomorrow (1932), produced by Alexander Korda. He later joined the repertory group of the Playhouse Theater in Oxford and began touring with various companies and was involved in some seasons in regional theater, being featured in 14 British films, including The Poisoned Diamond (1933), directed by W. P. Kellino; Norah O'Neale (1934), directed by Brian Desmond Hurst; Regal Cavalcade (1935); and The Girl in the Crowd (1935), directed by Michael Powell. He had the male lead in The Student's Romance (1935) with Grete Natzler and Honours Easy (1935) with Greta Nissen and was in Abdul the Damned (1935), Mister Hobo (1935) with George Arliss, Wrath of Jealousy (1936), and Two's Company (1936). During the same time, Knowles met Gladys Enid Percival, an actress and homemaker, and married the 23 year old on 3 October 1935. After a few tours Knowles went to London and appeared in \\"By Appointment\\" in 1936, where he was spotted by Irving Asher of Warner Bros. and got a Hollywood contract for more than 2 years. He had the lead in his final British films, The Brown Wallet (1936), directed by Powell; Fair Exchange (1936),directed by Ralph Ince; and Crown v. Stevens (1936), directed by Powell. =Warner Bros= In 1936 he arrived in New York alongside his wife and appeared in his first American film, Give Me Your Heart (1936) with Kay Francis, released in Great Britain as Sweet Aloes, Knowles was cast as a titled Englishman of means. In 1939 and at the age of 27, Knowles moved to his new residence with his wife in Tarzana, Los Angeles, California, USA. During his free time Knowles became a licensed private pilot in the late 1930s. His second film for Warners was The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), where he played the younger brother of Errol Flynn, who was loved by Olivia de Havilland. Knowles returned to England to make Irish for Luck (1936), and then supported Bette Davis in It's Love I'm After (1937). Knowles was top billed in some B pictures at Warners, Expensive Husbands (1937) and The Patient in Room 18 (1938). He was reteamed with Flynn and De Havilland in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), playing Will Scarlett, and Four's a Crowd (1938). He supported Flynn and Davis in The Sisters (1938).More than two decades after Flynn's death, biographer Charles Higham accused Flynn of having been a fascist sympathizer and Nazi spy. Knowles, who had served in World War II as a flying instructor in the Royal Canadian Air Force, came to Flynn's defense, writing Rebuttal for a Friend as an epilogue to Tony Thomas' Errol Flynn: The Spy Who Never Was (Citadel Press, 1990) . Republic borrowed Knowles to play the lead in Storm Over Bengal (1938). At Warners he had support roles in two B pictures, Heart of the North (1938) and Torchy Blane in Chinatown (1939), then he left the studio. =RKO= Knowles signed a contract at RKO, for whom he made Beauty for the Asking (1939) with Lucille Ball; Five Came Back (1939) also with Ball, directed by John Farrow; and The Spellbinder (1939). He went to MGM for Another Thin Man (1939) and Fox for The Honeymoon's Over (1939) then went back to RKO for two more with John Farrow, Married and in Love (1940) and A Bill of Divorcement (1940), then Anne of Windy Poplars (1941), playing Gilbert Blythe. In 1940 a limerick circulated about Knowles: How pleasant to know Patric Knowles/ Who is the kindest of souls/ But being handsome and a British swell/ Nobody expects him to act very well/ Which is why he never gets good roles. =World War II= In 1940 Knowles left Hollywood and travelled to Canada to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He had hundreds of hours of flying experience but an eye ailment meant he became an instructor. At Fox he was in How Green Was My Valley (1941) for John Ford. =Universal= Knowles went to Universal for a support part in The Wolf Man (1941). He went to Republic for Women in War (1941) then was top billed in Universal's The Strange Case of Doctor Rx (1942), and Mystery of Marie Roget (1942) with Maria Montez. He supported Irene Dunne in Lady in a Jam (1942), Constance Bennett in Sin Town (1942), Abbott and Costello in Who Done It? (1942) and Hit the Ice (1943), Ilona Massey in Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943), Rosemary Lane in All by Myself (1943), The Andrews Sisters in Always a Bridesmaid (1943), Olsen and Johnson in Crazy House (1943), Donald O'Connor and Peggy Ryan in Chip Off the Old Block (1944) and This Is the Life (1944), and Gloria Jean in Pardon My Rhythm (1944). During this time he continued to serve as a flying instructor with the US Air Force. =Paramount= Knowles went to Paramount where he supported Paulette Goddard in Kitty (1945), Dorothy Lamour in Masquerade in Mexico (1945), Barbara Stanwyck in The Bride Wore Boots (1946), and Alan Ladd in O.S.S. (1946). He went to Warners for Of Human Bondage (1946) and Universal borrowed him to play Joan Fontaine's leading man in the thriller Ivy (1947). He went back to Paramount for Monsieur Beaucaire (1946) with Bob Hope, Variety Girl (1947), Dream Girl (1948), and Isn't It Romantic? (1949). Knowles went to RKO for The Big Steal (1949), and Fox for Three Came Home (1950), second billed, playing Claudette Colbert's husband. =Television= Knowles began appearing on TV shows such as The Bigelow Theatre, Studio One in Hollywood, Lights Out, Hollywood Opening Night, Robert Montgomery Presents, The Revlon Mirror Theater, The United States Steel Hour, The Whistler, Studio 57, The Ford Television Theatre, and Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre. He still appeared in features such as Quebec (1951), Mutiny (1952), Tarzan's Savage Fury (1952) (as the villain), Jamaica Run (1953), Flame of Calcutta (1953) for Sam Katzman (second billed to Denise Darcel), World for Ransom (1954), Khyber Patrol (1954) and No Man's Woman (1955). From the late 1950s Knowles became an almost exclusively television actor appearing in Star Stage, The 20th Century-Fox Hour, Tales of the 77th Bengal Lancers , Ethel Barrymore Theatre, Lux Video Theatre, Matinee Theatre, Schlitz Playhouse, The Millionaire, Lux Playhouse, Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, Wagon Train, General Electric Theater, 77 Sunset Strip, Tightrope, Maverick in episodes \\"The Wrecker\\" with Jack Kelly and \\"Guatemala City\\" with James Garner, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Klondike, The Jim Backus Show, Death Valley Days, The Islanders, Checkmate, Peter Gunn, Whispering Smith, Hawaiian Eye, Have Gun – Will Travel (as Phileas Fogg in the episode \\"Foggbound\\"), Gunsmoke, The Rogues, Mickey, and Jericho. He had a small role in the feature Band of Angels (1957), From the Earth to the Moon (1958) and Auntie Mame (1958). He wrote a novel, Even Steven (Vantage Press, 1960, ASIN B0006RMC2G). =Later career= Knowles' later appearances included The Way West (1967) for director Andrew McLaglen Family Affair, Garrison's Gorillas, The Devil's Brigade (1968) for McLaglen, In Enemy Country (1968), D.A.: Murder One (1969), Chisum (1970) with John Wayne for McLaglen as John Tunstall, Getting Together, Marcus Welby, M.D., The Man (1972), Terror in the Wax Museum (1973) and Arnold (1973). Knowles was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame. =Death= Knowles died from a brain hemorrhage at West Hills Hospital in West Hills, California on 23 December 1995, where he was cremated and his ashes distributed to family and friends. He left behind his wife Gladys, his two children as well as four grandchildren.

This term is usually applied to media criticism in the fields of feminism and queer theory to describe the ways in which the media promotes stereotypes and denies specific identities. Gaye Tuchman (1978) divided the concept of symbolic annihilation into three aspects: omission, trivialisation and condemnation. This multifaceted approach to coverage not only vilifies communities of identity, but work to make members invisible through the explicit lack of representation in all forms of media ranging from film, song, books, news media and visual art. \\"Representation in the fictional world signifies social existence; absence means symbolic annihilation.\\" (Gerbner & Gross, 1976, p. 182) Tuchman states in the Mass Media book for A-level students on page 109 that women are represented far less than males on TV. Tuchman also stated that when women have roles, they are mostly negative. Symbolic or \\"gentle\\" violence Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu described symbolic annihilation as a form of subtle violence which disregards the legitimacy of an identity. A society is susceptible to the media it consumes and the social norms as depicted by the media can be instructive to consumers as a model of behavior toward the minority group. Invisibility or negative portrayal of minorities in media denies their existence in society. The result is that familiarity and behavioral codes are not well established and interaction is characterized by differences between groups. Feminist argument Since the 1970s, scholars of feminism have used the concept of annihilation to express the effects misrepresentation and/or absence of women and girls in mass media has had on their ability to find secure employment, advance in the workplace, and create unique identities. Lisa P. Hebert notes that media are \\"crucial in the construction and dissemination of gender ideologies, and thus, in gender socialization\\". Many such scholars argue that mainstream depictions of women and girls result from dominant racial, gender, and class ideologies. These ideologies, when skewed from reality, distort representation into demeaning stereotype or trivializing portrayals. Feminist theorists argue that such flawed media representations further distort the viewer's conceptualization of women, their role in a society, and how one interacts with them. The ultimate cost of this pattern, to feminist scholars, is the symbolic erasure (or annihilation) of positive and empowered female role models in popular media. Women who consume this media, over a period of years, are said to internalize oppression through giving merit to stereotype. Hebert, in speaking about the effects of misrepresentation and symbolic annihilation of black females, describes the stereotype that is depicted in mainstream media and often adopted by female viewers: > \\"In addition to the black body ideal of large breasts, thin waist and round > buttocks presented in videos, many of the black women featured depict a > Westernized beauty ideal of lighter skin, long hair, and blue or green eyes. > Racist and sexist thinking informs the way color-caste hierarchies affect > black females.\\" Dr. Marty Klein writes that for such women to conform to the stereotypical norms depicted in mass media, to be an acceptable female, many feel they \\"have to carefully modulate, and therefore undermine, their own sexuality\\". Gay and lesbian argument Like feminist scholars, gays and lesbians also argue that the misrepresentation of LGBT people in mainstream media has bolstered negative treatment towards many self-identified LGBT individuals in the last century. Media educators Larry Gross and George Gerbner argue that \\"the commercial structure of the mass media limits the opportunity for representing diverse characters\\". Many similar scholars and activists feel entertainment media networks and film companies avoid portraying openly LGBT characters in the plots of prime-time shows and big-budget films for fear of alienating or offending advertisers, investors, and audiences who remain loyal to heteronormativity. Many LGBT activists posit profit motives scare away openly LGBT characters from scripts or advertising imagery due to the perceived repercussions or backlash of heterosexuals in the media consumer market. =Latest trends= However, in recent years many television shows and Hollywood films are featuring prominent gay or lesbian characters, which are oftentimes white. The popularity of shows like Will & Grace and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy as well as films like Brokeback Mountain illustrate that networks are increasingly willing to feature gay characters, as long as produced content draws high ratings, and generate profits for advertisers during show hours. Some, like Ramin Setoodeh of the Daily Beast, note many media executives are forcing popular straight gay-for-pay to ensure and accomplish these profits. Openly gay and lesbian actors like Neil Patrick Harris or Portia de Rossi often play straight roles to ensure heterosexual audience comfort, further annihilating depictions of LGBT reality from media. This profit-motivation means that networks are careful in their portrayals of gay and lesbian characters. While Will & Grace does feature two openly gay male characters, the content lacks discussion about gay romance or intimacy. The two gay characters are merely friends, never depicted as lovers, and are rarely shown engaging in sexual relations with other males. The primary focus of their depictions are as friends to the heterosexual female characters on the television broadcast. See also *Critical theory *Larry Gross References * Gerbner, G., & Gross, L.

The school is affiliated to the Presbyterian Church, and serves approximately girls from Years 7 to 13 (ages 10 to 18).  History  St Andrew's Church at Rangi Ruru The school was founded in 1889 when Frederick Gibson bought a school run in Papanui by friends of his, Ada, Kate and Jessie Gresham, who were moving to Australia. The school had 18 students, aged 5 to 16 years old. Initially Gibson's daughters Alice and Helen and their mother Mary ran the school, calling it \\"Miss Gibson's Private School for Girls\\". In 1891 the school moved to a building in Webb Street and was renamed Rangi Ruru, meaning \\"wide sky-shelter\\". This name had been suggested by a Māori chief of Rapaki Pa, Pāora Taki, a friend of Frederick Gibson. Helen Gibson continued as Principal and her sisters Alice, Ethel, Ruth and Winifred joined as teachers. The school prospered under Helen Gibson's leadership, and grew to over 200 students at the time of her death in 1938. From 1938 until the sale of the school in 1946, Ethel Gibson was principal; her sisters continued to assist and support her. The school moved to its present site in 1923, as the Webb Street building was becoming too small. Te Koraha, the original house on the site, had been the home of the Rhodes family; it was made available to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York for their June 1901 royal visit to Christchurch. The Rangi Ruru Board of Governors was established in 1946 when Presbyterian Church members purchased the school from the Gibson family. While the Christchurch Presbytery approves appointments, the board is autonomous. In the early 1980s the school wanted to have an on-site chapel, while simultaneously the congregation of St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church at Hospital Corner was declining. It was decided to relocate the church to the school site, and in 1986 the building was moved to land adjacent to the school on Merivale Lane. The church became known as \\"St Andrew's at Rangi Ruru\\". Academic achievement Rangi Ruru is consistently one of New Zealand's highest-achieving schools in academic achievement. In 2013, 100 percent of girls leaving Rangi Ruru held at least NCEA Level 1, 98.2 percent held at least NCEA Level 2, and 92.0 percent held at least University Entrance. This is compared to 86.8%, 77.2%, and 55.4% respectively for girls nationally. Academic scholarships Each year about 3 per cent of Year 13 students studying each subject at level 3 will get Scholarship. In 2009 Rangi Ruru students achieved a total of 62 Scholarships in 18 subjects by 38 students, including 14 with Outstanding Performance. In 2008, Rangi girls achieved a total of 41 Scholarships, including five with Outstanding Performance, in 14 subjects by 31 students. In 2007, Rangi girls achieved 51 Scholarship awards with nearly 44% of successful scholarship entries. Athletics Rangi girls are highly active in over 40 sport codes and the school is recognised for its sporting achievements. It is regularly one of the top performing schools at rowing's Maadi Cup having won the Dawn Cup for overall achievement on a number of occasions. The school has a very high sports participation rate (consistently over 95% per annum), and a large number of girls who are high performance athletes, representing the region or country in their sports code. Culture Rangi Ruru has an excellent reputation for the cultural and creative opportunities it offers students and the achievement of students in this area. Both while at school and for those who pursue their creative interests through tertiary and career. The school's Visual Arts Faculty is held in particularly high regard and is notable for the number of students achieving NZ Scholarships. In 2004, Rangi Ruru was the first school in New Zealand to perform the musical Les Misérables: School Edition in collaboration with Christ's College.

It was later shown in reruns on Sci-Fi Channel's Cartoon Quest. Structured as a battle between good and evil, the show was played for comedy. The Grump, the purportedly-threatening villain of the piece, was voiced by extravagant prop comic Rip Taylor. History The main character was a small, grumpy wizard who put a spell of gloom on the kingdom of the Princess Dawn. The Princess and her friend Terry Dexter (a boy from the \\"real\\" world) searched for the Cave of the Whispering Orchids to find a crystal key to break the spell, while the Grump tried to stop them. In each episode the Grump flew a dragon named Dingo, chasing Terry and Princess Dawn. This led them to bizarre places with strange characters, such as the Blabbermouth of Echo Island, where the mountains were made of living Swiss cheese. The Princess had a pet named Bip — a vaguely doglike creature with tentacular legs, that sniffed clues like a hound dog, turned around by pulling in its tail and head and popping them back out at opposite ends, and communicated in the sounds of a soprano bugle. In most episodes, the Princess and her friends traveled in a flying car supported by a big balloon. A recurring gag was that at the very last minute when the Grump was about to catch up with Princess Dawn, the Dragon would sneeze and burn the little wizard. The character of the Grump was based upon Yosemite Sam, also created by Friz Freleng. The Grump's Dragon was similar to Sam's in \\"Knighty Knight Bugs\\", right down to the fiery nasal explosions upon its master. Broadcast The series was broadcast by NBC from September 6, 1969 to December 27, 1969. NBC continued to air reruns until December 28, 1970. The series lasted one season and was rerun, the most recent airing was on the Sci-Fi Channel in the mid 1990s. The complete series was released on DVD on January 31, 2006. The series was called Ahi viene cascarrabias in Spanish and was in retransmitted into the 1970s and 1980s by Televisa and another rerun in 2006 after the DVD set was launched. It was \\"Grump, o feiticeiro trapalhão\\" in Brazilian Portuguese and was in retransmitted until 1993 by Rede Globo. The only known merchandise for the show was a \\"Here Comes the Grump\\" Halloween mask, produced by the Ben Cooper Costume Company, for the 1969 holiday season.

The venue plays host to contemporary performance, film, visual art exhibitions and television production. Having closed for redevelopment in September 2014, Riverside Studios reopened in the autumn of 2019 with one of the first television broadcasts to come from Studio 1 at Riverside was the 2019 December UK election coverage on Channel 4. Film studio In 1933, a former Victorian iron foundry on Crisp Road, London, was bought by Triumph Films and converted into a relatively compact film studio with two stages and a dubbing theatre. In 1935 the studios were taken over by Julius Hagen (then owner of Twickenham Studios) with the idea of using Riverside as an overflow for making quota quickies. However, by 1937 his company had gone into liquidation. Between 1937 and 1946, the studios were owned by Jack Buchanan and produced such films as We'll Meet Again (1943) with Vera Lynn and The Seventh Veil (1945) with James Mason. In 1946 the studios were acquired by Alliance Film Studios (then owners of Twickenham Studios and Southall Studios) and produced films including They Made Me a Fugitive (1948) with Trevor Howard, The Happiest Days of Your Life (1950) with Alistair Sim and Margaret Rutherford and Father Brown (1954) with Alec Guinness. BBC Studios In 1954, the studio was acquired by the British Broadcasting Corporation for its television service.'Direct Television from Alexandra Palace', by Arthur Dungate. A history of the Riverside Studios. http://www.vtoldboys.com/arthur/river.htm Renamed The BBC Riverside Television Studios, the building was officially opened on 29 March 1957 by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Series 2 to 6 of Hancock's Half Hour (1957–60) were made there, along with other comedy, drama and music programmes, including the science-fiction serial Quatermass and the Pit (1958–59), Dixon of Dock Green, Six-Five Special, Z-Cars, Top of the Pops, the children's programmes Blue Peter and Play School. Episodes of Doctor Who were made at Riverside between 1964 and 1968, and Studio 1 was where First Doctor William Hartnell's regeneration scene was filmed. The facility remained in regular use until the BBC left in 1974. Riverside Studios / Riverside Trust The mission of Riverside Studios is to present a high quality arts programme and to make it accessible to all. In 1974, a charitable trust formed by Hammersmith and Fulham Council took control of the building, and two large multi-purpose spaces designed by Michael Reardon were created from the studio's two main sound stages. While preparing Riverside's opening festival in 1976, the venue's first Artistic Director Peter Gill permitted an amateur West London music group called The Strand to use one of the performances spaces to rehearse. They went on to become The Sex Pistols. Riverside's original policy was to have a combination of in house and visiting company productions of classical and contemporary plays and dance. Running concurrently with the main programme were regular events and activities including a film, music, education, workshop and play reading programme. David Gothard, the founding programming director, brought \\"The Dead Class\\" by Tadeusz Kantor and the Cricot 2 company from Krakow in Poland in 1977. Gothard was pivotal in Riverside Studios next steps. Riverside Studios became fully operational in 1978 with Gill's landmark production of The Cherry Orchard, for which Julie Covington turned down the lead in Evita. The venue quickly acquired an international reputation for excellence and innovation with productions including The Changeling with Brian Cox and Robert Lindsay (1979), Measure for Measure with Helen Mirren (1979) and Julius Caesar with Phil Daniels (1980), as well as a variety of international work – including, notably, that of Polish theatre maestro Tadeusz Kantor. In 1978, Riverside hosted the first of many Dance Umbrella seasons, featuring the work of Rosemary Butcher and Richard Alston. Gill also offered residencies to artists including Bruce McLean and Ian Coughlin and companies such as the Black Theatre Co-operative (now nitroBEAT). Art exhibitions (including 'Prints' by Howard Hodgkin, 1978) had been curated by Milena Kalinovska in Riverside's foyer, but following Gill's departure in 1980, a purpose-built gallery space was established by the resident Architect Will Alsop and John Lyall along with Technical Director Steven Scott. The directorship of Jenny Stein established the first exhibition and showed works by the painter and graphic artist Edvard Munch. Subsequent exhibitions included David Hockney (Paintings and Drawings for Parade, 1981), Antony Gormley (New Sculpture, 1984), Louise Bourgeois (Recent Work, 1990) and Yoko Ono (In Facing, 1990) From 1980, David Gothard directed the performing arts program and invited Michael Clark to become Riverside's first resident choreographer and made 16 original pieces at the studios before establishing his own dance company in 1984. Also in 1980, Samuel Beckett directed the San Quentin Theatre Workshop's rehearsals of his play Endgame in Studio 2, returning to Riverside four years later to direct the same company in Waiting for Godot. Under David Gothards direction the international theatre and dance program thrived with performance by Dario Fo and Franca Rame, Le Cirque Imaginaire, Eckehard Scall and the Berliner Ensemble, The Market Theater of Johannesburg, Cricot 2 of Krakow, Collectivo De Parma, and dance independent dance collaborations with Merce Cunningham and John Cage and members of the Judson Church. At the same time the legendary american tap dancers appeared in a sellout production of No Maps on My Taps featuring Chuck Green. During this period Riverside Studios was an artistic powerhouse that laid the foundations for its future. British artists flocked to the foyer and joined in collaborations with David Gothard from across all the arts disciplines including Peter Greenaway, Michael Nyman, Hanif Kureshi, Rebecca O'Brien, Jane Bernstein, David Leveaux, and a network of the worlds leading arts festivals and producing theaters including Edinburgh Festival, Spoleto Festival, Avignon Festival and Berlins Hebbel Theater. The in-house team in the early years was headed by the acclaimed lighting designer Rory Dempster and production manager John Leonard, Marketing guru's Erica Bolton and Jane Quinn, photographer and graphics master Chris Harris/Ha and his assistant Brian Maloney and completed by Steven Scott leading the productions, technical and building developments. Alsop and Lyall were housed in the building followed by Percy Harris and the Motley Design Course, Michael Clark who all joined Bruce McLean in the residencies. On 2 November 1987, a 200-seat cinema was opened by the actress Vanessa Redgrave. In 1990, jazz veteran Adelaide Hall starred in the movie Sophisticated Lady, a documentary about her life, which included a performance of her in concert recorded live at the Riverside Studios.\\"Jazz on a Summer's Night: Sophisticated Lady (1990)\\", BFI. William Burdett-Coutts (also Artistic Director of Assembly) was appointed Artistic Director of Riverside Studios in 1993. While Riverside continued its multi-arts programming (hosting companies such as Complicite, The Wooster Group and Howard Barker's The Wrestling School), its 200-seat cinema was celebrated for its double bill programmes and the variety of international film festivals which took place annually. In 1996, television production returned to Riverside when TFI Friday with Chris Evans took up residence in Studio 1 (until 2000). CD:UK was broadcast from Riverside between 2003 and 2006, while later TV projects included Channel 4's T4 (2006–2009), Popworld and The Last Leg, BBC's Never Mind the Buzzcocks and ITV's Celebrity Juice (2008–2014). In September 2014, Riverside closed for redevelopment. Redevelopment London developer Mount Anvil, working in conjunction with A2 Dominion, redeveloped the old Riverside Studios and the adjacent Queen's Wharf building. Assael Architecture, were employed to design a new building on the site centred around 165 residential flats, with new studio facilities for theatre and television, two cinemas, a riverside restaurant and café/bar as well as flexible event spaces. As part of the redevelopment, a new riverside walkway connects to the Thames Path alongside the late Victorian Hammersmith Bridge. During the redevelopment, Riverside continued to produce shows including Nirbhaya by Yael Farber at a number of international venues including Southbank Centre and Lynn Redgrave Theatre (2015), Raz, a new play by Jim Cartwright at Trafalgar Studios (2016) and A Christmas Carol with Simon Callow at the Arts Theatre (2016–17). Riverside's digital production team also recorded a number of theatre and dance productions for broadcast including Land of Our Fathers by Chris Urch, Northern Ballet's adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four and Out of Joint's production of The Winters Tale. A blue plaque produced by the Hammersmith and Fulham Historic Buildings Group to commemorate Riverside's history was installed at the venue's main entrance in March 2018. In January 2019 it was announced that the studios were taking bookings ahead of reopening in August 2019.

He formerly worked at The Kansas City Star and Times- Picayune in New Orleans. Thompson's topics have covered a wide range of sports issues, from football, basketball, and baseball, to car racing, sports history, Father's Day, and bullfighting. Thompson also covered the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup in the subcontinent of India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka.  Early life and education  Thompson is a native of Clarksdale in northern Mississippi, the son of Mary Thompson. His late father, Walter Wright Thompson, an attorney, played a pivotal role in Clarksdale's emergence as a tourist destination based on blues music. The senior Thompson was an ardent Democrat who was the Mississippi finance chairman for the 1984 John Glenn presidential campaign. He later supported Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton in their campaigns against George Herbert Walker Bush.  Career  Thompson started his sportswriting career while a student at the University of Missouri in Columbia, having covered Missouri sports and writing as a columnist for the School of Journalism's Columbia Missourian. Between his junior and senior years, he interned at the Times-Picayune in New Orleans and later was the LSU beat writer there. He later moved to the Kansas City Star, where he covered a wide variety of sports events including Super Bowls, Final Fours, The Masters, and The Kentucky Derby. In 2006, he assumed full-time writing duties at ESPN.com.

He is credited with developing the elite theory and the doctrine of the political class and is one of the three members constituting the Italian school of elitism together with Vilfredo Pareto and Robert Michels.Robert A. Nye, The Anti-Democratic Sources of Elite Theory: Pareto, Mosca, Michels, Sage, 1977, p. 22.J. J. Chambliss (ed.), Philosophy of Education: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2013, p. 179.  Life  Mosca earned a degree in law from the University of Palermo in 1881. In 1887 he moved to Rome and took a position as editor of proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies of Italy. Having taught occasionally at Palermo and Rome, Mosca became chair of constitutional law at the University of Turin in 1896. He would hold this position until 1924, when he settled permanently in Rome to occupy the chair of public law at the University of Rome. Mosca held several other academic positions throughout his life. He was skeptical towards democracy, and placed his lifelong liberalism in direct opposition to mass democracy. In a 1904 interview, he stated: > I can certainly call myself an anti-democrat, but I am not an anti-liberal; > indeed I am opposed to pure democracy precisely because I am a liberal. I > believe that the ruling class ought not to be monolithic and homogeneous but > ought to consist of elements which are diverse in regard to origin and > interests; when, instead, political power originates from a single source, > even if this be elections with universal suffrage, I regard it as dangerous > and liable to become oppressive. Democratic Jacobinism is an illiberal > doctrine precisely because it subordinates everything to a single force, > that of the so-called majority, on which it does not set any limits. In 1909 Mosca was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of Italy, in which he served until 1919. During this time, he served as Under-secretary for the Colonies from 1914 until 1916. During this time, Mosca also worked as a political journalist for the Corriere della Sera of Milan (after 1901) and the Tribuna of Rome (from 1911 to 1921).A.. Colombo, \\"L'eredità di Gaetano Mosca\\", Corriere della Sera, August 8, 2010, p. 38. In 1919, Mosca was nominated life senator of the Kingdom of Italy. He served actively in this capacity until 1926. In 1925 he signed the Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals. On numerous occasions, the elderly Mosca took to the floor to speak against bills endorsed by Benito Mussolini which intended to curtail political rights and parliamentary institutions. Mosca explained his opposition to these bills not only by referring to his own faith in political liberties as values worth preserving, but also by appealing to the \\"development and progress\\" that accompanied those nations where political liberties had been safeguarded through representative institutions. Parliamentary regimes were able to protect civil and political liberties because they provided an independent source of authority through which to limit the power of the rulers. Mosca's speeches in support of civil liberties and parliamentary government, as well as his steadfast refusal to compromise with the fascist regime, exerted an important influence on members of the intellectual opposition to Mussolini's dictatorship such as Gaetano Salvemini and Piero Gobetti. Mosca is most famous for his works of political theory. These were ' (Theory of Governments and Parliamentary Government), published in 1884; ' (The Ruling Class), published in 1896; and ' (History of Political Doctrines), published in 1936.  Political thought  Mosca's enduring contribution to political science is the observation that all but the most primitive societies are ruled in fact, if not in theory, by a numerical minority. He named this minority the political class. That means that every society could be split between two social classes: the one who rules and the one which is ruled. This is always true, for Mosca, because without a political class there is no rule. Although his theory is correctly characterized as elitist, it should be observed that its basis is far different from The Power Elite described by, for example, C. Wright Mills. Unlike Mills and later sociologists, Mosca aimed to develop a universal theory of political society and his more general theory of the Political Class reflects this aim. C.. Martinelli, \\"L'organizzazione del potere nel pensiero di Gaetano Mosca\\", Giornale di Storia Costituzionale, 17, first semester, 2009, pp. 177-205. Mosca defined modern elites in term of their superior organizational skills. These organizational skills were especially useful in gaining political power in modern bureaucratic society. Nevertheless, Mosca's theory was more liberal than the elitist theory of, for example, Pareto, since in Mosca's conception, elites are not hereditary in nature and peoples from all classes of society can theoretically become elite: when this happens, the reproduction of power is defined as democratic; whereas, when the member's recycle remains inside the elite, the reproduction of power is defined as aristocratic. He also adhered to the concept of the circulation of elites, which is a dialectical theory of constant competition between elites, with one elite group replacing another repeatedly over time. That concept came from his materialist idea of history as a conflict between classes (Marx), from the conflicted nature of politic considered as a fight for acquisition and department of power (Machiavelli) and finally from the non-egalitarian and hierarchical structure of society. Unlike Marx, Mosca has not a linear concept of time, but a circular one, as in classical political theory, which consists in a perpetual condition of conflict and recycle of the elite. For Mosca, the dichotomous structure of society wouldn't be solved by the revolution.

The economic and other disadvantages experienced by such countries makes the majority of landlocked countries Least Developed Countries (LDCs), with inhabitants of these countries occupying the bottom billion tier of the world's population in terms of poverty.Paudel. 2005, p. 2. Apart from Europe, there is not a single successful highly developed landlocked country as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI), and nine of the twelve countries with the lowest HDI scores are landlocked.Faye et al. 2004, p. 31-32. Landlocked European countries are exceptions in terms of development outcomes due to their close integration with the regional European market. Landlocked countries that rely on transoceanic trade usually suffer a cost of trade that is double that of their maritime neighbours.Hagen. 2003, p. 13. Landlocked countries experience economic growth 6% less than their non- landlocked countries, holding other variables constant.Paudel. 2005, p. 11. About 442.8 million people live in current LLDCs, as of 2012.  UN-OHRLLS  The United Nations has an Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS). It mainly holds the view that high transport costs due to distance and terrain result in the erosion of competitive edge for exports from landlocked countries.UN-OHRLLS. 2005. In addition, it recognizes the constraints on landlocked countries to be mainly physical, including lack of direct access to the sea, isolation from world markets and high transit costs due to physical distance. It also attributes geographic remoteness as one of the most significant reasons why developing landlocked nations cannot alleviate themselves, while European landlocked cases are mostly developed because of short distances to the sea through well-developed countries. One other commonly cited factor is the administrative burdens associated with border crossings as there is a heavy load of bureaucratic procedures, paperwork, custom charges, and most importantly, traffic delay due to border wait times, which affect delivery contracts.Faye et al. 2004, p. 47. Delays and inefficiency compound geographically, where a 2 to 3 week wait due to border customs between Uganda and Kenya makes it impossible to book ships ahead of time in Mombasa, furthering delivery contract delays.Faye et al. 2004, p. 48. Despite these explanations, it is also important to consider the transit countries that neighbour LLDCs, from whose ports the goods of LLDCs are exported. Dependency problems Although Adam Smith and traditional thought hold that geography and transportation are the culprits for keeping LLDCs from realizing development gains, Faye, Sachs and Snow hold the argument that no matter the advancement of infrastructure or lack of geographic distance to a port, landlocked nations are still dependent on their neighbouring transit nations.Faye et al. 2004, p. 32. Outlying this specific relationship of dependency, Faye et al. insist that though LLDCs vary across the board in terms of HDI index scores, LLDCs almost uniformly straddle at the bottom of HDI rankings in terms of region, suggesting a correlated dependency relationship of development for landlocked countries with their respective regions.Faye et al. 2004, p. 39. In fact, HDI levels decrease as one moves inland along the major transit route that runs from the coast of Kenya, across the country before going through Uganda, Rwanda and then finally Burundi. Just recently, it has been economically modeled that if the economic size of a transit country is increased by just 1%, a subsequent increase of at least 2% is experienced by the landlocked country, which shows that there is hope for LLDCs if the conditions of their transit neighbours are addressed.Paudel. 2012, p. 17. In fact, some LLDCs are seeing the brighter side of such a relationship, with the Central Asian nations geographic location between three BRIC nations (China, Russia and India) hungry for the region's oil and mineral wealth serving to boost economic development.Fara. 2012, p. 76. The three major factors that LLDCs are dependent on their transit neighbours are dependence on transit infrastructure, dependence on political relations with neighbours, and dependence on internal peace and stability within transit neighbours.Faye et al. 2004, p. 40. =Burundi= thumb400px Burundi is shown in blue. Its possible export routes were: * dependent on infrastructure of transit neighbour Tanzania (yellow), or * dependent on political relations with transit neighbour Kenya (orange), or * dependent on internal stability of transit neighbour Mozambique (red). When all three routes were unavailable, Burundi had to rely on the port of Durban in South Africa (brown). Burundi has relatively good internal road networks, but it cannot export its goods using the most direct route to the sea since the inland infrastructure of Tanzania is poorly connected to the port of Dar es Salaam.Faye et al. 2004, p. 44. Thus Burundi relies on Kenya's port of Mombasa for export; but this route was severed briefly in the 1990s when political relations with Kenya deteriorated. Further, Burundi's exports could not pass through Mozambique around the same time due to violent civil conflict. Thus, Burundi had to export its goods using a 4500 km route, crossing several borders and changing transport modes, to reach the port of Durban in South Africa. =Other African countries= * Mali had problems exporting goods in the 1990s as nearly all its transit neighbours (Algeria, Togo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire) were engaged in civil war around the same time.Faye et al. 2004, p. 46-47. The lone exception was Ghana, which was under military rule but did not have an active civil war at the time. * The Central African Republic's export routes are seasonal: in the rainy season Cameroon's roads are too poor to use; and during the dry season the Democratic Republic of Congo's Oubangui River water levels are too low for river travel. =Central Asia= The mineral resource-rich countries of Central Asia and Mongolia offer a unique set of landlocked cases to explore in more depth, as these are nations where economic growth has grown exceptionally in recent years. In Central Asia, oil and coal deposits have influenced development: Kazakhstan’s GDI per capita in purchasing power parity was five times greater than Kyrgyzstan's in 2009. Despite substantial development growth, these nations are not on a stable and destined path to being well developed, as the exploitation of their natural resources translates into an overall low average income and disparity of income, and because their limited deposits of resources allow growth only in the short term, and most importantly because dependence on unprocessed materials increases the risk of shocks due to variations in market prices.Fara. 2012, p. 77. And though it is widely conceived that free trade can permit faster economic growth,Paudel. 2012, p. 11. Mongolia is now subjected to a new geopolitical game about the traffic on its railway lines between China and Russia.Bulag. 2009, p. 100. Russian Railways now effectively owns 50% of Mongolia's rail infrastructure, which could mean more efficient modernization and the laying of new rail lines, but in reality also translates into powerful leverage to pressure the government of Mongolia to concede unfair terms for license grants of coal, copper, and gold mines.Bulag. 2009, p. 101. Thus, it can be argued that these nations with extraordinary mineral wealth should pursue economic diversification. All of these nations possess education qualifications, as they are inheritors of the Soviet Union's social education system. This implies that it is due to poor economic policies that more than 40% of the labour force is bogged down in the agricultural sector instead of being diverted into secondary or tertiary economic activity. Yet, it cannot be ignored that Mongolia benefits exceptionally from its proximity to two giant BRIC nations, resulting in a rapid development of railway ports along its borders, especially along the Chinese border, as the Chinese seek to direct coking coal from Mongolia to China's northwestern industrial core as well as for transportation to Japan and South Korea, resulting in revenue generation through the port of Tianjin. =Nepal= Nepal is another landlocked country with extreme dependency on its transit neighbour India. India does not have poor relations with Nepal, nor does it lack relevant transport infrastructure or internal stability. However, there have been two cases of economic blockades imposed by the government of India on Nepal - the official 1989 blockade and the unofficial 2015 blockade - both of which left the nation in severe economic crisis. In the 1970s, Nepal suffered from large commodity concentration and a high geographic centralization in its export trade: over 98% of its exports were to India, and 90% of its imports came from India.Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1114. As a result of all this, Nepal had a poor trade bargaining position. In the 1950s, Nepal was forced to comply with India's external tariffs as well as the prices of India's exports. This was problematic since the two countries have different levels of development, resulting in greater gains for India which was larger, more advanced and with more resources. It was feared that a parasitic relationship might emerge, since India had a head start in industrialization, and dominated Nepal in manufacturing, which could reduce Nepal to being just a supplier of raw materials.Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1116-7. Because of these problems, and Nepal's inability to develop its own infant industries (as it could not compete with Indian manufactures)Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1117. treaties were drafted in 1960 and 1971, with amendments to the equal tariffs conditions, and terms of trade have since progressed.Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1118. Almaty Ministerial Conference In August, 2003, the International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries on Transit Transport Cooperation (Almaty Ministerial Conference) was held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, setting the necessities of LLDCs in a universal document whereas there were no coordinated efforts on the global scale to serve the unique needs of LLDCs in the past. Other than acknowledging the main forms of dependency that must be addressed, it also acknowledged the additional dependency issue where neighbouring transit countries are often observed to export the same products as their landlocked neighbours. One result of the conference was a direct call for donor countries to step in to direct aid into setting up suitable infrastructure of transit countries to alleviate the burden of supporting LLDCs in regions of poor development in general. The general objectives of the Almaty Program of Action is as follows: *Reduce customs processes and fees to minimize costs and transport delays *Improve infrastructure with respect to existing preferences of local transport modes, where road should be focused in Africa and rail in South Asia *Implement preferences for landlocked countries’ commodities to boost their competitiveness in the international market *To establish relationships between donor countries with landlocked and transit countries for technical, financial and policy improvementsUN-OHRLLS. 2003.

The drawing can be left as it is or used as the basis for further refinement. While superficially similar to brass rubbing and other forms of rubbing intended to reproduce an existing subject, and in fact sometimes being used as an alternative term for it, frottage implies using this rubbing technique to create an original image. It was developed by surrealist artist Max Ernst in 1925. Ernst was inspired by an ancient wooden floor where the grain of the planks had been accentuated by many years of scrubbing. The patterns of the graining suggested strange images to him. He captured these by laying sheets of paper on the floor and then rubbing over them with a soft pencil.

Generally, restite is composed of a predominance of mafic minerals because these are harder to melt (see Bowen's reaction series). Typical minerals are amphibole, biotite, pyroxene, ilmenite or other iron oxides and some plagioclase feldspar. When chunks of restite are caught up within the granite it is known as a restite inclusion or enclave.  S-type restite reactions  Restite in S-type granites is produced from the melting, within the Earth's crust, of a typical metamorphic mineral assemblage of high-pressure gneiss of sedimentary origin; :biotite + quartz + feldspars → OH-bearing melt + orthopyroxene + cordierite + residual feldspars The melt reaction produces a granitic melt and solid orthopyroxene and cordierite. Cordierite in restite inclusions is unstable at low pressures; this reverts to Al-rich mica and quartz during ascent with the entraining magma. Orthopyroxene, unstable at low temperatures, reverts to an assemblage of biotite plus quartz. Restite feldspars will typically be a sodic plagioclase. Thus, restite inclusions in S-type granites will be a recrystallised granoblastic textured inclusion of biotite-muscovite-feldspar- quartz. If the restite minerals are carried with the magma, as the minerals become thermo-barometrically unstable during ascent, they will react back with the magma to form biotite from orthopyroxene, and feldspar or mica from cordierite. These reactions also involve consumption of significant quantities of water, and hence, will preclude the generation of a hydrothermal solution.  I-type restite reactions  Restite reactions in I-type granites are essentially similar, but due to the mafic and granitic source rocks, the restite assemblage is predisposed to produce an orthopyroxene + clinopyroxene + plagioclase +/- garnet assemblage. Similar to the reactions occurring in S-type granites, the restite minerals will revert to hornblende and plagioclase upon ascent, resorbing water and precluding generation of hydrothermal solutions. Porphyry copper deposits are generally associated with I-type granites which are not restite mediated.  Importance of restite  Restite is an important constituent in fractional crystallisation and igneous differentiation processes. Restite acts as a form of buffer within magma, acting as a reservoir primarily of water and water-adsorbent minerals, which may prevent or retard a granitic magma from attaining water saturation. This is analogous to the behaviour of a chemical buffer solution or mineral redox buffer except in this case it is a mineral-water exchange. This process occurs by hydration of ferromagnesian minerals, particularly hornblende, which may adsorb up to 5% H2O, and by conversion of pyroxene to hornblende during melting or fractionation at temperatures below the pyroxene stability field. This process is envisaged as, for instance, pyroxene-bearing restite inclusions 'soaking up' water and being converted to hydrous hornblende- bearing inclusions. Secondly, restite acts as a compositional buffer, providing elements to the surrounding magma as it is melted and ground up by erosive forces within the ascending magma. Restite can, in large enough amounts, retard the compositional changes of a magma either via providing more reagents or physically trapping crystals within the magma. Generally, restite is not present within magmas in large amounts and thus the effects of the above processes are not usually profound. However, it is likely that, particularly for S-type granite which is formed by wholesale anatexis (melting) of metasedimentary rocks, restite mediated melting and fractionation is crucial to the composition and behaviour of these magmas. In magmas which do not have a restite component, such as most M-type granites, some A-type granites, and most basaltic magmas, it is much easier for these magmas to achieve more dramatic fractional crystallization effects.

Future US is owned by parent company, Future plc, a specialist media company based in Bath, Somerset, England. History The company was established when Future plc acquired struggling Greensboro (N.C.) video game magazine publisher GP Publications, publisher of Game Players magazine, in 1994. The company launched a number of titles including PC Gamer, and relocated from North Carolina to the San Francisco Bay Area, occupying various properties in Burlingame and South San Francisco. When Chris Anderson, the founder of Future plc, sold Future to Pearson plc he retained GP, renamed Imagine Media, Inc. in June 1995, and operated it as his sole company for a few years. Buoyed by the Internet economy and the success of Business 2.0 in the US (and subsequently in the UK, France, Italy and Germany), Future rode the boom of the late nineties. During this period the company won the exclusive worldwide rights to produce the official magazine for Microsoft's Xbox video game console and cemented its position as a leader in the games market. In the spring of 2001, buffeted by economic factors and the market downturn, Future Network USA went through a strategic reset of its business that included the closure of some titles and Internet operations and the sale of Business 2.0 to AOL/Time Warner.

He probably used several aliases throughout his career, including Benjamin Bridgeman, and was known as Long Ben to his crewmen and associates. Dubbed \\"The Arch Pirate\\" and \\"The King of Pirates\\" by contemporaries, Every was infamous for being one of few major pirate captains to escape with his loot without being arrested or killed in battle, and for being the perpetrator of what has been called the most profitable act of piracy in history. Although Every's career as a pirate lasted only two years, his exploits captured the public's imagination, inspired others to take up piracy, and spawned works of literature. Every began his pirate career while he was first mate aboard the warship Charles II. As the ship lay anchored in the northern Spanish harbour of Corunna, the crew grew discontented as Spain failed to deliver a letter of marque and Charles IIs owners failed to pay their wages, and they mutinied. Charles II was renamed the Fancy and Every elected as the new captain. Every's most famous raid was on a 25-ship convoy of Grand Mughal vessels making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, including the treasure-laden Ghanjah dhow Ganj-i-sawai and its escort, Fateh Muhammed. Joining forces with several pirate vessels, Every found himself in command of a small pirate squadron, and they were able to capture up to £600,000 in precious metals and jewels, equivalent to around £ in , making him the richest pirate in the world. This caused considerable damage to England's fragile relations with the Mughals, and a combined bounty of £1,000—an immense sum at the time—was offered by the Privy Council and the East India Company for his capture, leading to the first worldwide manhunt in recorded history. Although a number of his crew were subsequently arrested, Every himself eluded capture, vanishing from all records in 1696; his whereabouts and activities after this period are unknown. Unconfirmed accounts state he may have changed his name and retired, quietly living out the rest of his life in either Britain or an unidentified tropical island, while alternative accounts consider Every may have squandered his riches. He is considered to have died anywhere between 1699 and 1714; his treasure has never been recovered.  Early life  =Background= Modern scholarship suggests Henry Every was born on 20 August 1659 in the village of Newton Ferrers, about southeast of Plymouth, Devon, England. Parish records suggest that he was the son of John Every and his wife, Anne (maiden name unknown); the Every family of Devon was quite established at the time, and it is likely he was a kinsman of the Every family of Wycroft Castle. According to the deposition of William Phillips, a member of Every's crew who gave a \\"voluntary confession\\" after his capture, in August 1696 Every was \\"aged about 40 years,\\" his mother lived \\"near Plymouth,\\" and his wife was a periwig seller who lived \\"in Ratcliffe Highway.\\"The National Archives SP 63/358 fols. 127–32 Every was married and records suggest that he wed one Dorothy Arther at St James Duke's Place in London on 11 September 1690, though there is no evidence that he had any children. The earliest biographical account of the man, The Life and Adventures of Capt. John Avery (London: J. Baker, 1709), states that he was born in 1653 in Cattedown, Plymouth. Although this location and date are now known to be incorrect, they have been frequently cited in earlier literature. (Another suggested year for Every's birth is 1665, though this too is in error.) The memoir's Dutch author, who wrote his account a little over a decade after the pirate had vanished, uses the name Adrian van Broeck, but this is probably a pseudonym. The account tells of Van Broeck's short captivity by Every's crew aboard Fancy, and claims that Every's father was a trading captain who had served in the Royal Navy under Admiral Robert Blake. Several later accounts of Every's life, most prominently Daniel Defoe's The King of Pirates (1720), have made reference to the earlier work, but it is of questionable veracity and has been described by the Dictionary of National Biography as \\"fiction, with scarcely a substratum of fact.\\" Although a theory existed that Every's birth name was actually Benjamin Bridgeman (especially in light of his nickname \\"Long Ben\\"), and that \\"Henry Every\\" was in fact an alias, modern scholarship has debunked it. It is accepted by historians that \\"Henry Every\\" was the pirate's real name, given that he used this name when he entered the Royal Navy. As this was prior to the onset of his piratical career, he would have had no need for an alias; he used the name \\"Bridgeman\\" only after committing piracy. Every may have been a cousin of the well-known Every baronets, though this has not been proven conclusively. = Royal Navy service = A steel engraving by Jean Antoine Théodore de Gudin depicting the Battle of Beachy Head, a naval engagement Every likely participated in while serving in the Royal Navy Every was probably a sailor from youth, serving on various Royal Navy ships. Popular accounts state that Every served aboard the English fleet bombarding Algiers in 1671, buccaneered in the Caribbean Sea, and even captained a logwood freighter in the Bay of Campeche, although these stories come from Van Broeck's fictional memoir. The substantiated record picks up in March 1689, shortly after the breakout of the Nine Years' War. England and its alliesthe Grand Alliance—Bavaria, the Dutch Republic, the Palatinate, Saxony, and Spainwere waging war against Louis XIV of France in an attempt to stop his expansions, and it was against this background that Every, now in his early thirties, was working as a midshipman aboard the sixty-four gun battleship HMS Rupert, then under the command of Sir Francis Wheeler. Every's naval records suggest he was something of a family man, who spent \\"little of his wages on extras such as tobacco and regularly consigned his pay to his family.\\" In mid-1689, HMS Rupert helped capture a large enemy French convoy off Brest, France. This victory gave Every an opportunity to better his fortunes and by the end of July he was promoted to Master's mate, although he was probably the most junior of HMS Ruperts three Master's mates. In late June 1690, he was invited to join Captain Wheeler on a new ship, the ninety-gun HMS Albemarle. He likely participated in the Battle of Beachy Head against the French two weeks later, although this engagement ended disastrously for the English. On 29 August of that year, Every was discharged from the Royal Navy. =Every and the slave trade= After discharge from the Royal Navy, Every entered the Atlantic slave trade. Between 1660 and 1698, the Royal African Company (RAC) maintained a monopoly over all English slave trade, making it illegal to sell slaves without a license. To ensure compliance, the navy protected the company's interests along the West African coast. Although illegal, unlicensed slaving could be a highly lucrative enterprise, as Every was certainly aware; the prospect of profits ensured that violations of the company's monopoly by \\"interlopers\\" (unlicensed slavers) remained a fairly common crime. In 1693, Every is identified in a journal prepared by an agent of the RAC, Captain Thomas Phillips of Hannibal, then on a slaving mission on the Guinea coast, who writes: \\"I have no where upon the coast met the negroes so shy as here, which makes me fancy they have had tricks play'd them by such blades as Long Ben, alias Every, who have seiz'd them and carry'd them away.\\" (Every was known to lure potential slave traders onto his ship by flying friendly English colours, then seize the slave traders themselves and chain them in his ship's hold alongside their former captives.) Captain Phillips, who according to his own writings had come across Every on more than one occasion—and may have even known him personally—also alluded to Every as slave trading under a commission from Issac Richier, the unpopular Bermudian governor who was later removed from his post for his carousing behavior. However, Every's slave trading employment is relatively undocumented.  Piratical career  = Spanish Expedition Shipping = In the spring of 1693, several London-based investors led by Sir James Houblon, a wealthy merchant hoping to reinvigorate the stagnating English economy, assembled an ambitious venture known as the Spanish Expedition Shipping. The venture consisted of four warships: the pink Seventh Son, as well as the frigates Dove (of which famed navigator William Dampier was second mate), James, and Charles II (sometimes erroneously given as Duke). Charles II had been commissioned by England's ally, Charles II of Spain (the ship's namesake), to prey on French vessels in the West Indies. Under a trading and salvage license from the Spanish, the venture's mission was to sail to the Spanish West Indies, where the convoy would conduct trade, supply the Spanish with arms, and recover treasure from wrecked galleons while plundering the French possessions in the area. The investors promised to pay the sailors well: the contract stipulated a guaranteed monthly wage to be paid every six months throughout deployment, with the first month's pay paid in advance before the start of the mission. Houblon personally went aboard the ships and met the crew, reassuring them of their pay. Indeed, all wages up to 1 August 1693, not long before the start of the mission, were paid on that date. An 1837 woodcut from The Pirates Own Book by Charles Ellms depicting Henry Every receiving three chests of treasure on board his ship, the Fancy. As a result of his previous experience in the navy, Every was promoted to first mate after joining the Spanish Expedition. The convoy's four ships were commanded by Admiral Sir Don Arturo O'Byrne, an Irish nobleman who had previously served in the Spanish Navy Marines. The voyage was soon in trouble, as the flag captain, John Strong, a career mariner who had previously served with Sir William Phips, died while the ship was still in port. Although he was replaced by Captain Charles Gibson, this would not be the last of the venture's misfortunes. By early August 1693, the four warships were sailing down the River Thames en route to Spain's northern city of Corunna. The journey to Corunna should have taken two weeks, but for some reason the ships did not arrive in Spain until five months later. Worse still, the necessary legal documents had apparently failed to arrive from Madrid, so the ships were forced to wait. As months passed and the documents still did not arrive, the sailors found themselves in an unenviable position: with no money to send home to support their families and unable to find alternative sources of employment, they had become virtual prisoners in Corunna. After a few months in port, the men petitioned their captain for the pay they should have received since their employment began. If this request had been granted, the men would no longer have been tied to the ship and could easily have left, so predictably their petition was denied. After a similar petition to Houblon by the men's wives had also failed, many of the sailors became desperate, believing that they had been sold into slavery to the Spanish. On 1 May, as the fleet was finally preparing to leave Corunna, the men demanded their six months of pay or threatened to strike. Houblon refused to acquiesce to these demands, but Admiral O'Byrne, seeing the seriousness of the situation, wrote to England asking for the money owed to his men. However, on 6 May some of the sailors were involved in an argument with O'Byrne, and it was probably around this time that they conceived of a plan to mutiny and began recruiting others.The National Archives, CO 388/4, f. 49 One of the men recruiting others was Every. As William Phillips, a mariner on Dove, would later testify, Every went \\"up & down from Ship to Ship & persuaded the men to come on board him, & he would carry them where they should get money enough.\\" Since Every had a great deal of experience and was also born in a lower social rank, he was the natural choice to command the mutiny, as the crew believed he would have their best interests at heart. = Mutiny and ascension to captaincy = On Monday, 7 May 1694, O'Byrne was scheduled to sleep ashore, which gave the men the opportunity they were looking for. At approximately 9:00 p.m., Every and about twenty-five other men rushed aboard Charles II and surprised the crew on board. Captain Gibson was bedridden at the time, so the mutiny ended bloodlessly. One account states that the extra men from James pulled up in a longboat beside the ship and gave the password, saying, \\"Is the drunken boatswain on board?\\" before joining in the mutiny. Captain Humphreys of James is also said to have called out to Every that the men were deserting, to which Every calmly replied that he knew perfectly well. James then fired on Charles II, alerting the Spanish Night Watch, and Every was forced to make a run to the open sea, quickly vanishing into the night. After sailing far enough for safety, Every gave the non-conspirators a chance to go ashore, even deferentially offering to let Gibson command the ship if he would join their cause. According to Charles Ellms, Every's words to Gibson were, \\"if you have a mind to make one of us, we will receive you; and if you turn sober, and attend to business, perhaps in time I may make you up of my lieutenants; if not, here's a boat, and you shall be set on shore.\\"Ellms 1837, p.26 The captain declined and was set ashore with several other sailors. The only man who was prevented from voluntarily leaving was the ship's surgeon, whose services were deemed too important to forgo. All of the men left on board Charles II unanimously elected Every captain of the ship. Some reports say that Every was much ruder in his dealings with Gibson, but agree that he at least offered him the position of second mate. In either case, Every exhibited an amount of gentility and generosity in his operation of the mutiny that indicates his motives were not mere adventure. Every was easily able to convince the men to sail to the Indian Ocean as pirates, since their original mission had greatly resembled piracy and Every was renowned for his powers of persuasion. He may have mentioned Thomas Tew's success capturing an enormous prize in the Red Sea only a year earlier. The crew quickly settled the subject of payment by deciding that each member would get one share of the treasure, and the captain would get two. Every then renamed Charles II the Fancy—a name which reflected both the crew's renewed hope in their journey and the quality of the ship—and set a course for the Cape of Good Hope. = The Pirate Round = At Maio, the easternmost of the Cape Verde's Sotavento islands, Every committed his first piracy, robbing three English merchantmen from Barbados of provisions and supplies. Nine of the men from these ships were quickly persuaded to join Every's crew, who now numbered about ninety-four men. Every then sailed to the Guinea coast, where he tricked a local chieftain into boarding Fancy under the false pretense of trade, and forcibly took his and his men's wealth, leaving them slaves. Continuing to hug the African coastline, Every then stopped at Bioko in the Bight of Benin, where Fancy was careened and razeed. Cutting away some of the superstructure to improve the ship's speed made Fancy one of the fastest vessels then sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. In October 1694, Fancy captured two Danish privateers near the island of Príncipe, stripping the ships of ivory and gold and welcoming approximately seventeen defecting Danes aboard. In early 1695, Fancy finally rounded the Cape of Good Hope, stopping in Madagascar where the crew restocked supplies, likely in the area of St. Augustine's Bay. The ship next stopped at the island of Johanna in the Comoros Islands. Here Every's crew rested and took on provisions, later capturing a passing French pirate ship, looting the vessel and recruiting some forty of the crew to join their own company. Every's total strength was now about 150 men. At Johanna, Every wrote a letter addressed to the English ship commanders in the Indian Ocean, falsely stating that he had not attacked any English ships. His letter describes a signal English skippers could use to identify themselves so he could avoid them, and warns them that he might not be able to restrain his crew from plundering their ships if they failed to use the signal. It is unclear whether this document was true, but it may have been a ploy by Every to avoid the attention of the East India Company (EIC), whose large and powerful ships were the only threat Fancy faced in the Indian Ocean. Either way, the letter was unsuccessful in preventing the English from pursuing him. = The Grand Mughal's fleet = In 1695, Every set sail for the volcanic island of Perim to wait for an Indian fleet that would be passing soon. The fleet was easily the richest prize in Asia—perhaps in the entire world—and any pirates who managed to capture it would have been the perpetrators of the world's most profitable pirate raid. In August 1695, Fancy reached the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, where Every joined forces with five other pirate captains: Tew on the sloop-of-war Amity, with a crew of about sixty men; Joseph Faro on Portsmouth Adventure, with sixty men; Richard Want on Dolphin, also with sixty men; William Mayes on Pearl, with thirty or forty men; and Thomas Wake on Susanna, with seventy men. All of these captains were carrying privateering commissions that implicated almost the entire Eastern Seaboard of North America. Every was elected admiral of the new six-ship pirate flotilla despite the fact that Tew had arguably more experience, and now found himself in command of over 440 men while they lay in wait for the Indian fleet. A convoy of twenty-five Grand Mughal ships, including the enormous 1,600-ton Ganj-i-sawai with eighty cannons, and its escort, the 600-ton Fateh Muhammed, were spotted passing the straits en route to Surat. Although the convoy had managed to elude the pirate fleet during the night, the pirates gave chase. Dolphin proved to be far too slow, lagging behind the rest of the pirate ships, so it was burned and the crew joined Every aboard Fancy. Amity and Susanna also proved to be poor ships: Amity fell behind and never again rejoined the pirate flotilla (Tew having been killed in a battle with a Mughal ship), while the straggling Susanna eventually rejoined the group. The pirates caught up with Fateh Muhammed four or five days later. Perhaps intimidated by Fancys forty-six guns or weakened by an earlier battle with Tew, Fateh Muhammeds crew put up little resistance; Every's pirates then sacked the ship, which had belonged to one Abdul Ghaffar, reportedly Surat's wealthiest merchant. While Fateh Muhammeds treasure of some £50,000 to £60,000 was enough to buy Fancy fifty times over, once the treasure was shared out among the pirate fleet, Every's crew received only small shares. An 18th- century depiction of Henry Every, with the Fancy shown engaging its prey in the background Every now sailed in pursuit of the second Mughal ship, Ganj-i- SawaiGanj-i-sawai (meaning \\"Exceeding Treasure,\\" and often Anglicized as Gunsway), overtaking it a few days after the attack on Fateh Muhammed. With Amity and Dolphin left behind, only Fancy, Pearl, and Portsmouth Adventure were present for the actual battle. Ganj-i-sawai, captained by one Muhammad Ibrahim, was a fearsome opponent, mounting eighty guns and a musket-armed guard of four hundred, as well as six hundred other passengers. But the opening volley evened the odds, as Every's lucky broadside shot his enemy's mainmast by the board. With Ganj-i-sawai unable to escape, Fancy drew alongside. For a moment, a volley of Indian musket fire prevented the pirates from clambering aboard, but one of Ganj-i-sawais powerful cannons exploded, instantly killing many and demoralizing the Indian crew, who ran below deck or fought to put out the spreading fires. Every's men took advantage of the confusion, quickly scaling Ganj-i-sawais steep sides. The crew of Pearl, initially fearful of attacking Ganj-i-sawai, now took heart and joined Every's crew on Indian ship's deck. A ferocious hand-to-hand battle then ensued, lasting two to three hours. Muhammad Hashim Khafi Khan, a contemporary Indian historian who was in Surat at the time, wrote that, as Every's men boarded the ship, Ganj-i-sawais captain ran below decks where he armed the slave girls and sent them up to fight the pirates. Khafi Khan's account of the battle, appearing in his multivolume work The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians, places blame squarely on Captain Ibrahim for the failure, writing: \\"The Christians are not bold in the use of the sword, and there were so many weapons on board the royal vessel that if the captain had made any resistance, they must have been defeated.\\" In any case, after several hours of stubborn but leaderless resistance, the ship surrendered. In his defense, Captain Ibrahim would later report that \\"many of the enemy were sent to hell.\\" Indeed, Every's outnumbered crew may have suffered anywhere from several to over a hundred casualties, although these figures are uncertain. According to Khafi Khan, the victorious pirates subjected their captives to an orgy of horror that lasted several days, raping and killing their terrified prisoners deck by deck. The pirates reportedly utilized torture to extract information from their prisoners, who had hidden the treasure in the ship's holds. Some of the Muslim women apparently committed suicide to avoid violation, while those women who did not kill themselves or die from the pirates' brutality were taken aboard Fancy. Although stories of brutality by the pirates have been dismissed by sympathizers as sensationalism, they are corroborated by the depositions Every's men provided following their capture. John Sparkes testified in his \\"Last Dying Words and Confession\\" that the \\"inhuman treatment and merciless tortures inflicted on the poor Indians and their women still affected his soul,\\" and that, while apparently unremorseful for his acts of piracy, which were of \\"lesser concern,\\" he was nevertheless repentant for the \\"horrid barbarities he had committed, though only on the bodies of the heathen.\\" Philip Middleton testified that several of the Indian men were murdered, while they also \\"put several to the torture\\" and Every's men \\"lay with the women aboard, and there were several that, from their jewels and habits, seemed to be of better quality than the rest.\\" Furthermore, on 12 October 1695, Sir John Gayer, then-governor of Bombay and president of the EIC, sent a letter to the Lords of Trade, writing: > It is certain the Pyrates, which these People affirm were all English, did > do very barbarously by the People of the Ganj-i-sawai and Abdul Gofor's > Ship, to make them confess where their Money was, and there happened to be a > great Umbraws Wife (as Wee hear) related to the King, returning from her > Pilgrimage to Mecha, in her old age. She they abused very much, and forced > severall other Women, which Caused one person of Quality, his Wife and > Nurse, to kill themselves to prevent the Husbands seing them (and their > being) ravished. Later accounts would tell of how Every himself had found \\"something more pleasing than jewels\\" aboard, usually reported to be Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's daughter or granddaughter. (According to contemporary EIC sources, Ganj-i-sawai was carrying a \\"relative\\" of the Emperor, though there is no evidence to suggest that it was his daughter and her retinue.) However, this is at odds with the deposition of Philip Middleton, who testified that \\"all of the Charless men, except Every, boarded [Fateh Muhammed and Ganj-i-sawai] by Turns.\\" At any rate, the survivors were left aboard their emptied ships, which the pirates set free to continue on their voyage back to India. The loot from Ganj-i-sawai, the greatest ship in the Muslim fleet, totaled somewhere between £200,000 and £600,000, including 500,000 gold and silver pieces. All told, it may have been the richest ship ever taken by pirates (see Career wealth below). All these factors combined made Every the richest pirate in history. The proclamation for the apprehension of Henry Every, with a reward of £500 sterling, that was issued by the Privy Council of Scotland on 18 August 1696 = Sharing the spoils = Every's pirates now busied themselves dividing their treasure. Although it is sometimes reported that Every used his phenomenal skills of persuasion to convince the other captains to leave the Mughal loot in his care, quickly slipping away into the night with the entire haul, this comes from Charles Johnson's A General History of the Pyrates, an unreliable account. More reliable sources indicate that there was an exchange of clipped coins between the crews of Pearl and Fancy, with Every's outraged men confiscating Pearls treasure. (Portsmouth Adventure observed but did not participate in the battle with Ganj-i-sawai, so Faro's crew received none of its treasure.) Every's men then gave Mayes 2,000 pieces of eight (presumably an approximate sum as the treasure captured would have been in Indian and Arabian coins of a different denomination) to buy supplies, and soon parted company. Fancy sailed for Bourbon, arriving in November 1695. Here the crew shared out £1,000 (roughly £93,300 to £128,000 today) per man, more money than most sailors made in their lifetime. On top of this, each man received an additional share of gemstones. As Every had promised, his men now found themselves glutted with \\"gold enough to dazzle the eyes.\\" However, this enormous victory had essentially made Every and his crew marked men, and there was a great deal of dispute among the crew about the best place to sail. The French and Danes decided to leave Every's crew, preferring to stay in Bourbon. The remaining men set course, after some dissension, for Nassau in the Bahamas, Every purchasing some ninety slaves shortly before sailing. Along the way, the slaves would be used for the ship's most difficult labor and, being \\"the most consistent item of trade,\\" could later be traded for whatever the pirates wanted. In this way, Every's men avoided using their foreign currency, which might reveal their identities. Sailing from the Indian Ocean to the Bahamas was a journey halfway around the world, and Fancy was forced to stop along the way at Ascension Island, located in the middle of the Atlantic. The barren island was uninhabited, but the men were able to catch fifty of the sea turtles that crawled ashore to lay their eggs on the beach, providing them enough food for the rest of the voyage. However, about seventeen of Every's crew refused to go any further and were left behind on the island. = Aftermath and manhunt = The plunder of Emperor Aurangzeb's treasure ship had serious consequences for the English, coming at a time of crisis for the East India Company (EIC), whose profits were still recovering from the disastrous Child's War. The EIC had seen its total annual imports drop from a peak of £800,000 in 1684, to just £30,000 in 1695, and Every's attack now threatened the very existence of English trade in India. When the damaged Ganj-i-sawai finally limped its way back to harbor in Surat, news of the pirates' attack on the pilgrims—a sacrilegious act that, like the raping of the Muslim women, was considered an unforgivable violation of the Hajj—spread quickly. The local Indian governor, Itimad Khan, immediately arrested the English subjects in Surat and kept them under close watch, partly as a punishment for their countrymen's depredations and partly for their own protection from the rioting locals. A livid Aurangzeb quickly closed four of the EIC's factories in India and imprisoned the officers, nearly ordering an armed attack against the English city of Bombay with the goal of forever expelling the English from India. To appease Aurangzeb, the EIC promised to pay all financial reparations, while Parliament declared the pirates hostis humani generis (\\"enemies of the human race\\"). In mid-1696, the government issued a £500 bounty on Every's head and offered a free pardon to any informer who disclosed his whereabouts. When the EIC later doubled that reward, the first worldwide manhunt in recorded history was underway. The Crown also promised to exempt Every from all of the Acts of Grace (pardons) and amnesties it would subsequently issue to other pirates. As it was by now known that Every was sheltering somewhere in the Atlantic colonies, where he would likely find safety among corrupt colonial governors, he was out of the jurisdiction of the EIC. This made him a national problem. Accordingly, the Board of Trade was tasked with coordinating the manhunt for Every and his crew. = Escape to New Providence = Meanwhile, Fancy had reached St. Thomas, where the pirates sold some of their treasure. In March 1696, Fancy anchored at Royal Island off Eleuthera, some northeast of New Providence in the Bahamas. Four of Every's men took a small boat to Nassau, the island's largest city and capital, with a letter addressed to the island's governor, Sir Nicholas Trott. The letter explained that Fancy had just returned from the coast of Africa, and the ship's crew of 113 self-identified interlopers (unlicensed English traders east of the Cape of Good Hope) now needed some shore time. In return for letting Fancy enter the harbor and for keeping the men's violation of the EIC's trading monopoly a secret, the crew would pay Trott a combined total of £860. Their captain, a man named \\"Henry Bridgeman,\\" also promised the ship to the governor as a gift once his crew unloaded the cargo. An early 20th-century painting depicting Captain Every's encounter with Emperor Aurangzeb's granddaughter and her retinue For Trott, this proved a tempting offer. The Nine Years' War had been raging for eight years, and the island, which the Royal Navy had not visited in several years, was perilously underpopulated. Trott knew that the French had recently captured Exuma, to the southeast, and were now headed for New Providence. With only sixty or seventy men living in the town, half of whom served guard duty at any one time, there was no practical way to keep Nassau's twenty-eight cannons fully manned. However, if Fancys crew stayed in Nassau it would more than double the island's male population, while the very presence of the heavily-armed ship in the harbor might deter a French attack. On the other hand, turning away \\"Bridgeman\\" might spell disaster if his intentions turned violent, as his crew of 113 (plus ninety slaves) would easily defeat the island's inhabitants. Lastly, there was also the bribe to consider, which was three times Trott's annual salary of £300. Trott called a meeting of Nassau's governing council, likely arguing that interloping was a fairly common crime and not a sufficient reason for turning away the men, whose presence now aided Nassau's security. The council agreed to allow Fancy to enter the harbor, apparently having never been told of the private bribe. Trott sent a letter to Every instructing him that his crew \\"were welcome to come and to go as they pleased.\\" Soon after, Trott met Every personally on land in what must have been a closed-door meeting. Fancy was then handed over to the governor, who found that extra bribes—fifty tons of ivory tusks, one hundred barrels of gunpowder, several chests of firearms and ammunition, and an assortment of ship anchors—had been left in the hold for him. The wealth of foreign-minted coins could not have escaped Trott. He must have known that the ship's crew were not merely unlicensed slavers, likely noting the patched-up battle damage on Fancy. When word eventually reached that the Royal Navy and the EIC were hunting for Fancy and that \\"Captain Bridgeman\\" was Every himself, Trott denied ever knowing anything about the pirates' history other than what they told him, adamant that the island's population \\"saw no reason to disbelieve them.\\" This he argued despite the fact that the proclamation for the pirates' capture specifically warned that Every's crew could \\"probably be known and discovered by the great quantities of Gold and Silver of forreign Coines which they have with them.\\" In the meantime, however, Every's men were free to frequent the town's pubs. Nevertheless, the crew soon found themselves disappointed with the Bahamas; the islands were sparsely populated, meaning that there was virtually no place to spend the money they had pirated. For the next several months the pirates spent most of their time living in relative boredom. By now Trott had stripped Fancy of everything valuable, and it was lost after being violently driven against some rocks, perhaps deliberately on the orders of Trott, who was eager to rid himself of a key piece of evidence. = Vanishing act = When the proclamation for the apprehension of Every and his crew reached Trott, he was forced to either put a warrant out for Every's arrest or, failing to do so, effectively disclose his association with the pirate. Preferring the former choice for the sake of his reputation, he alerted the authorities as to the pirates' whereabouts, but was able to tip off Every and his crew before the authorities arrived. Every's 113-person crew then fashioned their hasty escape, vanishing from the island with only twenty-four men ever captured, five of whom were executed. Every himself was never seen again. His last words to his men were a litany of conflicting stories of where he planned to go, likely intended to throw pursuers off his trail. It has been suggested that because Every was unable to buy a pardon from Trott or from the governor of Jamaica, his crew split up, some remaining in the West Indies, the majority heading to North America, and the rest, including Every himself, returning to England. Of these, some sailed aboard the sloop Isaac, while Every and about twenty other men sailed in the sloop Sea Flower (captained by Faro) to Ireland towards the end of June 1696. They aroused suspicions while unloading their treasure, and two of the men were subsequently caught. Every, however, was able to escape once again.  Fate  Avery sells his Jewels, an engraving by Howard Pyle which appeared in the September 1887 issue of Harper's Magazine British author and pirate biographer Charles Johnson suggested that, after attempting to sell his diamonds, Every died in poverty in Devon after being cheated out of his wealth by Bristol merchants. It is, however, unclear how Johnson could have discovered this. If Every was known to be living in poverty, it is most likely that he would have been apprehended and the large bounty on his head collected. As such, ascribing this fate to Every may have been a type of moral propagandizing on Johnson's part. Others have suggested that after Every changed his name, he settled in Devon and lived out the rest of his life peacefully, dying on 10 June 1714; however, the source for this information is The History and Lives of All the Most Notorious Pirates and their Crews (London: Edw. Midwinter, 1732), considered an unreliable (and slightly expanded) reprint of Johnson's General History. In October 1781 John Knill, the Collector of Customs at St Ives, Cornwall, held a meeting with a descendant of Every who stated that his ″father had told him that Captain Every, after wandering about in great poverty and distress, had died in Barnstaple, and was buried as a pauper ...″ As the manhunt for Every continued in the decade following his disappearance, sightings were frequently reported, but none proved reliable. After the publication of a fictional memoir in 1709, which claimed Every was a king ruling a pirate utopia in Madagascar, popular accounts increasingly took on a more legendary, romantic flavor (see In contemporary literature). Although such stories were widely believed to be true by the public, they had no basis in reality. No reliable information about Every's whereabouts or activities emerged after June 1696.  Fate of Every's crew  = North American colonies = About seventy-five of Every's crew sailed to North America in hopes of escaping the transcontinental manhunt. His crew members were sighted in the Carolinas, New England, and in Pennsylvania, where some even bribed Governor William Markham for £100 per man. This was enough to buy the governor's allegiance, who was aware of their identity and reportedly even allowed one to marry his daughter. Although other local officials, notably magistrate Captain Robert Snead, tried to have the pirates arrested, the governor's protection ensured that they remained audacious enough to boast of their exploits \\"publicly over their cups.\\" When Snead's persistence started to irritate the governor, the magistrate was reprehended: > He [Markham] called me rascal and dared me to issue my warrants against > these men, saying that he had a good mind to commit me. I told him that were > he not Governor I would not endure such language, and that it was hard to be > so treated for doing my duty. He then ordered the constables not to serve > any more of my warrants; moreover being greatly incensed he wrote a warrant > with his own hand to the Sheriff to disarm me. Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, and other colonies published the proclamation for Every's capture, but rarely went beyond this. Although harboring pirates became more dangerous for the colonial governors over time, only seven of Every's crew were tried between 1697–1705, and all of these were acquitted. = British Isles = John Dann (Every's coxswain) born in East Hoathly, Sussex, was arrested on 30 July 1696 for suspected piracy at the Bull Hotel, a coaching inn on the High Street of Rochester, Kent. He had sewn £1,045 in gold sequins and ten English guineas into his waistcoat, which was discovered by his chambermaid, who subsequently reported the discovery to the town's mayor, collecting a reward in the process. In order to avoid the possibility of execution, on 3 August Dann agreed to testify against other captured members of Every's crew, joining Middleton, who had given himself up to authorities a few weeks prior. Soon after, twenty-four of Every's men had been rounded up, some having been reported to authorities by jewelers and goldsmiths after trying to sell their treasure. In the next several months, fifteen of the pirates were brought to trial and six were convicted. As piracy was a capital crime, and the death penalty could be handed down only if there were eyewitnesses, the testimony of Dann and Middleton was crucial. The title page of the report issued in 1696 by the High Court of Admiralty following the trial of Every's crew The six defendants—Joseph Dawson, 39 years old, from Yarmouth; Edward Forseith, 45, Newcastle upon Tyne; William May, 48, London; William Bishop, 20, Devon; James Lewis, 25, London; and John Sparkes, 19, London—were indicted on charges of committing piracy on Ganj-i-Sawai, with the trial commencing on 19 October 1696 at the Old Bailey. The government assembled the most prominent judges in the country to attend the trial, consisting of presiding judge Sir Charles Hedges, Lieutenant of the High Court of Admiralty; Sir John Holt, Chief Justice of the King's Bench; Sir George Treby, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; and six other prominent judges. Other than Joseph Dawson, all the pirates pleaded not guilty. One of the witnesses against the accused mutineers was David Creagh, second officer of Charles II. He testified that after refusing to participate in the mutiny—the only officer to do so—he was ordered to return below deck. On the way to his cabin, Creagh encountered May, Captain Gibson's former steward. May, described by Every as one of the \\"true cocks of the game, and old sportsmen,\\" was zealously supportive of the mutiny, and Creagh testified of their bone- chilling exchange: > I met with W. May, the Prisoner at the Bar. What do you say here? says he. I > made him no Answer, but went down to my Cabin; and he said, God damn you, > you deserve to be shot through the Head; and he then held a Pistol to my > Head. Then I went to my Cabin, and presently came orders from Every, that > those that would go ashore, should prepare to be gone. And when the Captain > was got out of Bed, who was then very ill of a Feaver, Every came and said, > I am a Man of Fortune, and must seek my Fortune. Despite considerable pressure on the jury to find the defendants guilty, with Judge Advocate of the Admiralty Sir Dr Thomas Newton reminding the jury that the consequences of an acquittal would be \\"the total loss of the Indian trade, and thereby the impoverishment of this kingdom,\\" the jury passed a verdict of not guilty. The shocked court rushed through another indictment, and twelve days later the pirates were tried on a different set of charges, this time on account of conspiring to steal Charles II with piratical intent. Although legally dubious today, the 17th century court assumed the defendants had the legal burden of proving themselves innocent of mutiny, having been found aboard \\"a ship...run away with.\\" As before, the court continually impressed the need for the pirates' conviction. Judge Hedges condemned the \\"dishonorable\\" former jury and instructed their successors to act with \\"a true English spirit\\" by passing a conviction, repeatedly reminding them to \\"support...the navigation, trade, wealth, strength, reputation, and glory of this nation.\\" When the guilty verdict was read aloud in court soon after, no one could have been surprised. The pirates were given their last chance to show why they should be spared execution, with most simply claiming ignorance and pleading for mercy. May argued that, being \\"a very sickly man,\\" he had \\"never acted in all the voyage,\\" while Bishop reminded the court that he was \\"forced away,\\" and, being only eighteen years of age during the 1694 mutiny, desired mercy. Dawson, the only defendant to plead guilty, was granted a reprieve. The remainder of the death sentences were upheld. Sparkes was the only pirate to publicly express some regret, but not for piracy, which was of \\"lesser concern\\"—instead, he was repentant for the \\"horrid barbarities he had committed, though only on the bodies of the heathen,\\" implying that he had participated in the violation of the women aboard the Mughal ships. His \\"Last Dying Words and Confession\\" declared that his eyes were \\"now open to his crimes,\\" and he \\"justly suffered death for such inhumanity.\\" On 25 November 1696, the five prisoners were taken to the gallows at Execution Dock. Here they solemnly gave their dying speeches before a gathered crowd, which included Newgate Prison ordinary Paul Lorrain. As they faced the River Thames, the place where the Spanish Expedition voyage began only three years earlier, the pirates were hanged. Dann escaped the hangman by turning King's witness. However, he remained in England, having received on 9 August 1698 an, \\"Order for one Dann, lately Every's mate but pardoned, to attend the Board to- morrow.\\" This he did on 11 August at the East India House, giving details of his voyage and plunder on board Fancy. In 1699, Dann married Eliza Noble and the following year became a partner to John Coggs, a well-established goldsmith banker, creating Coggs & Dann at the sign of the King's Head in the Strand, London. The bankers (particularly Dann) were duped by fraudster Thomas Brerewood, one of their clients, and in 1710 the bank became insolvent. Dann died in 1722.  Career wealth  = Ganj-i-Sawai = A woodcut from The Pirates Own Book showing the Fancy engaging the Ganj-i-Sawai. The value of Ganj-i-Sawais cargo is not known with certainty. Contemporary estimates differed by as much as £300,000, with £325,000 and £600,000 being the traditionally cited numbers. The latter estimate was the value provided by the Mughal authorities, while the EIC estimated the loss at approximately £325,000, nevertheless filing a £600,000 insurance claim. It has been suggested that the EIC argued for the lowest estimate when paying reparations for Every's raid, with the company's president naturally wanting the most conservative estimate in order to pay as little for the damages as possible. Others contend that the Mughal authorities' figure of £600,000 was a deliberate overestimate aimed at improving their compensation from the English. While some historians have argued that £325,000 was probably closer to the true value, partly because this agreed with the estimate provided by contemporary Scottish merchant Alexander Hamilton, then stationed in Surat, and partly for the above reasons, others have criticized this position as being largely unsubstantiated. Although Every's capture of Ganj-i-Sawai has been cited as piracy's greatest exploit, it is possible that other pirates have perpetrated even more profitable raids. In April 1721, John Taylor and Olivier Levasseur captured the 700-ton Portuguese galleon Nossa Senhora do Cabo (\\"Our Lady of the Cape\\"), bound to Lisbon from the Portuguese colony of Goa. It had been damaged in an Indian Ocean storm and was undergoing repairs at the French island of Réunion when the pirates struck. Reportedly carrying the retiring Luís Carlos Inácio Xavier de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Louriçal, the galleon was laden with silver, gold, diamonds, gems, as well as pearls, silks, spices, works of art, and church regalia belonging to the Patriarch of the East Indies. The total value of the treasure on board has been estimated as being anywhere from £100,000 to £875,000 (£500,000 in diamonds and £375,000 in other cargo), all of which was divided among the crews of Cassandra and Victory, captained by Taylor and Levasseur respectively. If the latter number is correct, it would far eclipse Every's haul. Historian Jan Rogoziński has called Cabo \\"the richest plunder ever captured by any pirate,\\" estimating its reported treasure of £875,000 to be worth \\"more than $400 million.\\" In comparison, the EIC's estimate of £325,000 for Ganj-i-Sawais goods equals \\"at least $200 million.\\" If the larger estimate of £600,000 is taken, this would be equivalent to $400 million, approximately rivaling the raid committed by Taylor and Levasseur. In any case, if one accepts the EIC's estimate of £325,000, Rogoziński writes that even then \\"only two or three times in history did criminals take more valuable loot.\\" = Other ships = Fateh Muhammeds cargo was valued to £50,000–60,000 according to the estimate provided by Dann at his trial; this amount is worth some $30 million in modern currency. Every is known to have captured at least eleven vessels by September 1695, including Ganj-i-Sawai. Aside from Emperor Aurangzeb's fleet, one of the more fruitful prizes was Rampura, a Cambay trading ship that produced the \\"surprising haul of 1,700,000 rupees.\\"  Legacy  Jack Avery, Capturing Ship of the Great Mogul, from the Pirates of the Spanish Main series (N19) for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes MET DP835024 = Influence among pirates = Every's exploits immediately captivated the public's imagination, and some considered him a sort of gallant maritime Robin Hood who exemplified the working class idea that rebellion and piracy were acceptable ways to fight back against unfair captains and societies. By joining the pantheon of other \\"noble pirates,\\" including Francis Drake and Henry Morgan, Every doubtlessly inspired many others to take up piracy. In particular, Every accomplished his feats while many infamous pirates of the post-Spanish-Succession period—Blackbeard, Bartholomew Roberts, Calico Jack, Samuel Bellamy, Edward Low, Stede Bonnet, and others—were still children, and his exploits had become legendary by the time they were young men. English pirate Walter Kennedy, who was born the same year Ganj-i-Sawai was plundered, had learned of Every's story at a young age and committed it to memory. When he retired from piracy, he returned to London to spend his riches, even opening a brothel in Deptford. However, Kennedy's crimes caught up with him and in 1721 he was arrested and sentenced to death. While awaiting his execution, Kennedy's favorite pastime was recounting tales of Every's adventures. Another Irishman, Edward England, one-time quartermaster to Charles Vane, spent most of his career in the Indian Ocean raiding Mughal ships in much the same way Every had done two decades earlier. After parting ways with Vane, England raided slaving ships off the coast of West Africa. In 1720, he captured a 300-ton Dutch East Indiaman of thirty-four guns off the Malabar Coast, and renamed his new flagship to Fancy. Unfortunately for England, he was subsequently marooned on Mauritius by his mutinous crew after refusing to grant them permission to torture their captives. After fashioning a makeshift raft, he drifted to the very island believed to be ruled of the King of Pirates himself. No pirate utopia awaited him, however, and he died an alcoholic beggar. Ironically, this was the fictional but moralized fate Charles Johnson ascribed to Every in his General History. It has been suggested that, like Every before him, England had a \\"brief, yet spectacular career,\\" and he may have come \\"closest to living out the Every legend.\\" = In contemporary literature = Some fictional and semi- biographical accounts of Every were published in the decades following his disappearance. In 1709, the first such account appeared as a sixteen-page pamphlet titled The Life and Adventures of Capt. John Avery; the Famous English Pirate, Now in Possession of Madagascar (London: J. Baker, 1709). It was written by an anonymous author using the pseudonym Adrian van Broeck, who claimed to be a Dutchman who endured captivity by Every's crew. In the account, Every is depicted as both a treacherous pirate and a romantic lover; after he raids the Mughal's ship, he runs off with—and later marries—the Emperor's daughter. The couple then flee the Mughal's army to Saint Mary's Island, where Every sets up a pirate utopia similar to the fictional pirate state of Libertalia. Every even has several children with the princess and establishes a new monarchy. The King of Madagascar soon commands an army of 15,000 pirates and a fleet of forty warships, and is said to be living in fantastic luxury in an impregnable fortress beyond the reach of his English and Mughal adversaries. Furthermore, Every mints his own currency: gold coins engraved in his royal likeness. Although wild rumours of Every's fate had been circulating for years, Adrian van Broeck's fictionalized biography provided the popular legend of Every that was to be borrowed by subsequent publications. Over time, much of the English public came to believe the memoir's sensationalist claims. European governments were soon receiving people who claimed to be Every's ambassadors from Saint Mary's, and as the legend grew even heads of state started to believe the astonishing stories. At one point, \\"English and Scottish officials at the highest level gave serious attention to the proposals of these 'pirate diplomats',\\" while Peter the Great \\"tried to hire the Saint Mary's pirates to help build a Russian colony on Madagascar.\\" The idea of a pirate haven on Saint Mary's had become a household idea. Owing to his notoriety, Every was, along with Blackbeard, one of the few pirates whose life was dramatized on stage. In 1712, playwright Charles Johnson published his highly romanticized tragicomedy The Successful Pyrate. It proved to be at once both controversial and successful, and was performed to regaled audiences at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, appearing in print in London the following year. The play was not without its detractors, however. Dramatist and critic John Dennis wrote a letter to the Master of the Revels criticizing him for licensing the play, which he blasted as \\"a prostitution of the stage, an encouragement to villainy, and a disgrace to the theater.\\" Nevertheless, the play ran into several editions. In 1720 Every appeared as the primary character of Daniel Defoe's The King of Pirates and as a minor character in his novel Captain Singleton. Both tales acknowledged the widely believed stories of Every's pirate republic. It was Charles Johnson's influential General History (1724) that established the competing account of Every. Arriving over a decade after Adrian van Broeck's memoir, Johnson's \\"historical\\" account revealed that Every was cheated of his wealth after attempting to sell his ill-gotten goods, in the end \\"not being worth as much as would buy him a coffin.\\" Yet another account appeared in The Famous Adventures of Captain John Avery of Plymouth, a Notorious Pirate (London: T. Johnston, 1809), although this is likely a retelling of earlier publications. In addition to the play and books written about Henry Every, a successful ballad was also printed in England during his career. Titled \\"A Copy of Verses, Composed by Captain Henry Every, Lately Gone to Sea to seek his Fortune,\\" it was first published as a broadside sometime between May and July 1694 by the London printer Theophilus Lewis, and was reportedly written by Every himself. Consisting of thirteen stanzas set to the tune of the 1686 ballad \\"The Success of Two English Travellers; Newly Arrived in London,\\" it was subsequently collected by Samuel Pepys and added to the Pepys Library. At least nine different reprints of the ballad, of varying similarity to the original published by Lewis, were printed between 1694 and 1907. More recently, the ballad has been featured in Roy Palmer's Oxford Book of Sea Songs (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986). \\"A Copy of Verses\\" contains a few statements, such as Every's declaration to have been \\"part-owner\\" of land near Plymouth, that were later corroborated by William Philips, the captured crew member with whom Every had once shared information. Despite this, it is unlikely Every wrote the verses. A more likely scenario is that one of the approximately fifteen or twenty loyal sailors who refused to join the mutiny had shared their knowledge of Every upon returning to England, where it was quickly turned into a ballad. A slightly modified copy was delivered to the Privy Council of England by Sir James Houblon on 10 August 1694, where it was used as evidence during the inquiry on the mutiny. By announcing Every's supposed intentions of turning pirate even before the mutiny was carried out, the ballad may have served to strengthen the council's convictions that the mutinous crew harbored piratical intentions from the outset. It is thus possible that the ballad was written and distributed as a way to convict Every. In any case, the strength of the ballad likely played a role in the government's outlawing of Every nearly two years before he had become known as the most infamous pirate of his time. During Every's career, the government used the media to portray him as a notorious criminal in an effort to sway public opinion on piracy, but the result has been described as a \\"near-total failure.\\" Much of the public continued to remain sympathetic to the pirate's cause. = Every's flag = There are no reliable contemporary accounts of Every's pirate flag. According to the ballad \\"A Copy of Verses,\\" Every's flag was red with four gold chevrons. The ballad suggests that the flag also had green lining the border, but more likely the ballad was mentioning a shield. Although red was a popular colour for pirate flags of the time, the meaning of the four chevrons is not certain; it may be an attempt (justified or not) to link Every with the West-Country gentry clan of Every whose coats-of-arms showed varying numbers of chevrons, red on gold or vice versa. However, there is no reliable evidence that Every actually flew such a flag. Another flag ascribed to Every depicts a white skull in profile wearing a kerchief and an earring, above a saltire of two white crossed bones, on a black or red field. = In modern popular culture = * A pirate captain named \\"Avery\\" is repeatedly mentioned in the 1966 Doctor Who serial The Smugglers; the plot centres on the search for Avery's treasure. * George Macdonald Fraser 1983 novel \\"the Pyrates\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pyrates traces the adventures of a classic hero (Captain Benjamin Avery, RN, very loosely based on Henry Avery), multiple damsels in distress, and the six captains who lead the infamous Coast Brotherhood (Calico Jack Rackham, Black Bilbo, Firebeard, Happy Dan Pew, Akbar the Terrible and Sheba the She-Wolf). It also concerns the charismatic anti-hero, Colonel Thomas Blood (cashiered), a rakish dastard who is loosely modeled on the historical figure, Thomas Blood. in 1986 the BBC released a movie adaptation of the novel https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470897/ with Marcus Gilbert in the role of Long Ben Avery. * The 2011 Doctor Who episode \\"The Curse of the Black Spot,\\" also features a pirate captain named Henry Avery, played by Hugh Bonneville. The fictional Avery is depicted as having started his career in the Royal Navy before turning pirate, being dedicated to his wife and children, and having captured a great treasure from an Indian Mughal. It also provides a fictional aetiology for his disappearance. In a \\"prequel\\" released by the BBC prior to the episode, the fictional Avery names his vessel as \\"the good ship Fancy.\\" Four episodes later, in \\"A Good Man Goes to War,\\" the Doctor recruits Avery and son in their new capacity as space pirates to assist him at the Battle of Demon's Run. * Henry Every is mentioned repeatedly in the TV series Black Sails, a prequel to Treasure Island. He is credited with inventing the Black Spot and discovering the Treasure Island. * Henry Avery is featured in the video game Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, in which protagonist Nathan Drake and his brother Samuel hunt for his treasure. * Enemy of All Mankind: A true story of piracy, power, and history's first global manhunt by Steven Johnson describes the attack of Every's group on the ship Ganj-i-sawai and its consequences.

Buddy Lee was an advertising mascot for Lee Jeans. The doll, a promotional item for the company from 1920 to 1962, was brought back as the star of television advertising for the company's Lee Dungarees line from 1998 until the mid-2000s. Early years Sales manager Chester Reynolds, later Lee's board president, came up with the idea of using a doll to \\"model\\" miniature versions of the company's clothes for store displays. The 12½-inch composition dolls first appeared in the windows of Dayton's flagship store on Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis, then were used at stores nationwide. Lee encouraged stores to sell the dolls after the displays were taken down, and later provided the dolls for retail sale, including versions dressed as a cowboy, Coca-Cola deliveryman, railroad worker and gas station attendant. Starting in 1949, Buddy Lee was produced as a 13-inch hard plastic doll. Although female versions of the so-called Betty Lee doll surface from time to time, there was no official Betty Lee doll ever made by the H. D. Lee Company; they never made any female doll at all. These dolls instead are composition carnival dolls (term used by collectors — dolls sold at carnivals as prizes) that look similar to the Buddy Lee doll. This information is direct from the historian who researched the Lee company archives in 2008 for a special Lee company function on the Buddy Lee doll. The Buddy Lee dolls were discontinued in 1962 because they were no longer profitable. By then, Buddy Lee had become the second-highest-selling doll in the United States. Television advertising In 1998, ad agency Fallon McElligott brought back the doll, along with the 1940s Lee tagline \\"Can't Bust 'Em,\\" to promote the Lee Dungarees line, aimed at 17- to 22-year-old males. The main campaign was preceded by guerrilla marketing techniques, including movie trailer-style teaser spots, unbranded posters of the doll, and a 6-minute mockumentary, \\"The Buddy Lee Story,\\" which was aired in segments during late-night cable television. The 1998 TV spots — \\"Car,\\" \\"Twister\\" and \\"Parachute\\" — were directed by Spike Jonze while Phil Morrison helmed the 1999 TV spots: \\"Actress\\" co-starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, \\"Animal Guy\\" co-starring Jack Hanna, \\"Blues Guy\\" co-starring Bobby Womack, \\"Sergeant\\" and \\"Fans\\". The comedic ads touted the unmoving Buddy Lee as a \\"Man of Action.\\" The doll was usually presented as a heroic figure who survived all manner of certain doom, prompting his human co-stars to marvel at the durability of his jeans. Three nemeses for Buddy Lee — Curry, Roy, and Super Greg (the latter portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen). — were introduced in 2000 through Web sites and appeared in three TV spots directed by Fredrik Bond. The following year, Lee Dungarees ads adopted a heroic folk theme song for the doll and the tagline \\"Be Like Buddy Lee.\\" Besides \\"Apartment,\\" \\"Street\\" and \\"Suburbia\\" directed by Ulf Johansson & Mats Lindberg from Traktor and \\"Barbershop\\" directed by Craig Gillespie, this series also included a special unbranded ad — directed by Fallon art director Harvey Marco and aired on behalf of the American Red Cross after the September 11, 2001 attacks — in which the doll sports a rolled-up sleeve, bandage and \\"I Gave\\" sticker to promote blood donation. 2002's campaign consisting of the TV spots \\"Cheese\\" and \\"Emu\\" was directed by Dante Ariola while Chris Smith helmed 2003's \\"Trailer,\\" \\"The Chase\\" and \\"Hall of Mirrors.\\" In November 2004, the doll starred in \\"Buddy Lee: Guidance Counselor,\\" a Jon Nowak-directed series of three 6-minute sponsored segments on otherwise commercial-free episodes of MTV2's interactive show Control Freak.

History Maid services may be different from what is generally thought to be the historically prevalent services performed by a maid, and these services may be provided by both male and/or female individuals. Stylized drawing of a maid on a Works Progress Administration poster Once part of an elaborate hierarchy in affluent homes and profitable businesses, today a maid may be the only domestic worker that upper and even middle-income households can afford, as a household domestic-help employee. Maids perform typical domestic chores such as cooking, ironing, washing, cleaning, grocery shopping, walking the family dog, and tending to the household children. Socio-economic factors In the Western world, comparatively few households can afford live-in domestic help employees, in lieu of live-in staff, a maid service is utilized as a periodic cleaner. In developing nations, differences found within income and social status between different socio-economic classes, lesser educated women, with less opportunity are believed to provide a labor source for domestic work. Socio-economic opportunities, not being confined to any specific global location, may allow cleaning services to perform 'cleaning' as their source of business as a service. There are thousands of residential cleaning businesses throughout the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Historically and traditionally, cleaning was considered a woman's role, but as more and more women have joined the workforce, the time pressure on families with children has grown, so paying a service for cleaning makes sense to persons who can afford it. Additionally, many modern homeowners lack the proper knowledge to use the safest and most effective cleaning products. Services provided Maids, per se, perform typical domestic chores such as cooking, ironing, washing, cleaning, folding clothes, grocery shopping, walking the family dog and taking care of children. Some maid services offer hourly, daily, weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly work as well. Reasons for use Utilizing a maid service may be considered due to a number of personal factors, including but not limited to geographical location, social standing, lack of personal time, lack of experience. There are many reasons why individuals may consider hiring help around the house, especially with cleaning. It may, for example, prove easier for them to enjoy time with their family rather than spending time cleaning. A maid service \\"maid car\\" used to transport maids to assignments, Ypsilanti Township, Michigan A maid service may be more expensive than simply hiring a part-time maid, but it offers a number of advantages. Usually the service will provide not only someone to do the cleaning, but also all of the necessary cleaning supplies. Also, as a bona fide employer, the service is responsible for withholding Social Security and other income taxes. Third, a service is insured and often bonded, so it can be held accountable if something is stolen or missing.

His New Zealand Sevens career began in 1988 and ran until past his 39th birthday in 2004. Rush played in more than 60 tournaments, with the highlights being two Commonwealth Games gold medals and the World Cup Sevens victory in 2001. He was also voted Best and Fairest Player at the 1991 Hong Kong Sevens. He was regarded as a pacy and skillful winger and also played for the All Blacks briefly until the emergence of Jonah Lomu effectively ended his All Blacks career. Lomu played a major role in the 2001 World Cup Sevens win, effectively filling in for Rush, who suffered a broken leg in New Zealand's last group match of that tournament. Career Rush switched full-time to rugby sevens in 1999 to compete in the newly formed IRB international Sevens circuit. Rush helped New Zealand to win the first six editions of the World Sevens Series. Over the course of 14 years, Rush regularly appeared for the New Zealand Sevens team at the Hong Kong Sevens and other sevens tournaments, mostly as captain. In later years, he was converted into a forward in the sevens version, with the wing position given to his understudy Karl Te Nana. In 15's rugby, Rush played first for Auckland Rugby Union then moved North to play for North Harbour at NPC level, where he blossomed. Retirement On retiring from playing in 2005 he became assistant to New Zealand Sevens coach Gordon Tietjens. In 2010 Rush became owner operator of the Browns Bay franchise of the New World Supermarket chain and in February 2014 took over the New World store in Kaikohe.

Angerer has played for Frauen- Bundesliga clubs Bayern Munich, Turbine Potsdam (with whom she won the 2005 UEFA Women's Cup) and FFC Frankfurt. In 2008, she played for Djurgårdens IF of the Swedish Damallsvenskan and she spent two periods on loan with Brisbane Roar of the Australian W-League in 2013 and 2014. During her extensive international career, Angerer was recognised as one of the world's best female goalkeepers. Since making her debut for the Germany women's national football team in August 1996, Angerer won a total of 146 caps. She understudied Silke Rottenberg at the UEFA Women's Championship in 1997, 2001 and 2005; the FIFA Women's World Cup in 1999 and 2003; as well as the 2000 and 2004 Olympic football tournaments. When Rottenberg was injured before the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, Angerer took over as first choice and kept a clean sheet in every round as Germany won the tournament. She remained first choice for the 2009 and 2013 editions of the UEFA Women's Championship, the 2011 and 2015 FIFA Women's World Cups and the 2008 Olympics. Germany won the UEFA Women's Championship on each of the five occasions Angerer was involved and won the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2003 and 2007. Their best finish at the Olympics was third in 2000, 2004 and 2008. Angerer is a penalty-saving specialist, having stopped Marta's kick in the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup Final and both Trine Rønning and Solveig Gulbrandsen's during the UEFA Women's Euro 2013 Final. She was appointed captain of Germany in 2011 following the retirement of Birgit Prinz. On 13 January 2014, Angerer was named FIFA World Player of the Year, becoming the first goalkeeper – male or female – to win the award. She announced her retirement for the end of the 2014–15 season on 13 May 2015. Club career Angerer was born in Lohr am Main, near Frankfurt. Her career began with ASV Hofstetten, where she played as a forward. When she substituted for the injured goalkeeper during a youth scouting game, she was discovered as a goalkeeping talent. In 1995, she moved to 1. FC Nürnberg and one year later to FC Wacker München. While at Wacker, she rejected the opportunity to play for an American college soccer team. From 1999 to 2001, Angerer played at FC Bayern Munich, helping the team achieve promotion to Germany's top division, the Bundesliga. She transferred to 1. FFC Turbine Potsdam in 2001, where she claimed two national Bundesliga championships, three German Cup wins and the UEFA Women's Cup in the 2004–05 season. After seven years at Potsdam, Angerer left Germany in 2008 to play at Djurgårdens IF Dam in Sweden, replacing Bente Nordby. She returned to Germany after only one season to join 1. FFC Frankfurt. She won the German Cup for a fourth time with Frankfurt in 2011. Following Birgit Prinz's retirement she was appointed Frankfurt's new captain. While playing at the UEFA Women's Euro 2013 Angerer announced her signing on a free transfer with the Brisbane Roar in Australia's W-League\\"DFB-Frauen: Angerer wechselt zu Brisbane Roar\\" , Focus, 14 July 2013 and further plans for a move to an as yet unspecified team in the NWSL by January 2014. =Portland Thorns FC= On 13 January 2014, Portland Thorns FC announced Angerer's acquisition to play for Portland for the National Women's Soccer League 2014 Season, replacing Karina LeBlanc who was traded to the Chicago Red Stars. She made her debut for Portland with a shutout against the Houston Dash on 12 April and went on to start 22 games for the Thorns, adding another three saves while compiling 74 saves (both ranking fourth in the league). After the season, Angerer was loaned to the Brisbane Roar with plans to return to Portland for the start of the 2015 season.Thorns FC loan goalkeeper Nadine Angerer to Australian club Brisbane Roar, defender Steph Catley to Melbourne Victory , Portland Thorns FC, 4 September 2014 Angerer retired from being a professional footballer in 2015. On July 17, 2020, Angerer was signed as an emergency replacement goalkeeper by Portland Thorns FC during the 2020 NWSL Challenge Cup. International career Angerer warming up for a match with Germany women's national football team in 2009 Angerer made her international debut for Germany against the Netherlands in August 1996. However, after five matches in quick succession she was only used sporadically thereafter. Angerer was Germany's second choice goalkeeper behind Silke Rottenberg for almost a decade, winning six major titles as a reserve player without having played in a single game, including the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, two Olympic bronze medals in 2000, 2004, and three UEFA European Championships in 1997, 2001 and 2005. When Rottenberg suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury, Angerer was picked as the starting goalkeeper for the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup. During the entire tournament she did not concede a single goal, setting the record for most consecutive minutes played without conceding a goal in World Cup play to 540 minutes. This included blocking a penalty kick by Marta in the 2–0 final win over Brazil. Along with Norway's Bente Nordby, she was named in FIFA's tournament All-Star Team. Angerer remained Germany's national team goalkeeper for the 2008 Summer Olympics, claiming the bronze medal. She won the European Championship for a fourth time in 2009, the first time she had been a starter for Germany.

Anja Mittag's goal gave the Germans their sixth successive title. In May 2015, Angerer was named to Germany's roster for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada. During a quarter-final match against France, she denied Claire Lavogez who took the crucial fifth penalty during the penalty shootout to clinch the win and advance to the semi-finals against the United States. Germany lost the semi-final 2–0 to the United States after Carli Lloyd scored a penalty and Kelley O'Hara added a second goal. In Angerer's final game with the national team she was beaten by another penalty, despite her angry protests. Fara Williams gave England a 1–0 extra time win in the bronze medal match. Coaching career Nadine Angerer coaching the Portland Thorns FC goalkeepers in 2017 =Portland Thorns FC= On 2 December 2015, Angerer was announced as the goalkeeper coach for the Portland Thorns.

He was governor of Buenos Aires in 1820, and then again from 1827 to 1828. Life and politics Dorrego was born in Buenos Aires on 11 June 1787 to José Antonio do Rego, a Portuguese merchant, and to María de la Ascensión Salas. He enrolled in the Real Colegio de San Carlos in 1803, and moved to the Real Universidad de San Felipe in the Captaincy General of Chile to continue his studies. He supported the early steps of the Chilean War of Independence in 1810, which led to the removal of the Spanish colonial authorities and the establishment of the first Chilean Government Junta.Galasso, p. 257 He moved to the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (modern Argentina), and joined the Army of the North, under the command of Manuel Belgrano. He fought in the battles of Tucumán and Salta, being injured in both. He was sanctioned by Belgrano for promoting a duel. As a result, he did not take part in the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, two defeats of the Army of the North, and Belgrano regretted later the absence of Dorrego from them. Dorrego opposed the Luso-Brazilian invasion of the Banda Oriental, encouraged by Juan Martín de Pueyrredón to counter the influence of José Gervasio Artigas. He was exiled by Pueyrredón, and stayed some time in Baltimore (United States). He studied federalism in the United States, and thought that each state of a country should have some autonomy, rejecting the strong centralization into a single government sought by Pueyrredón. During this times he wrote the Cartas apologéticas, criticizing the support of Pueyrredón to the Luso-Brazilian invasion.Galasso, pp. 257–258 He returned to Buenos Aires in 1819, following the departure of Pueyrredón. He was appointed as interim governor, and fought against the armies of Alvear, Carrera and Estanislao López. Still, he was resisted in the city, and the stable appointment as governor was given to Martín Rodríguez instead. He was banished again, and moved to Upper Peru. He met Simón Bolívar in Quito, and supported his ideas of unifying all the continent into a giant federation.Galasso, p. 258 Dorrego returned to Buenos Aires a short time afterwards and worked in the legislature of Buenos Aires in the 1826 Constituent Assembly. He strongly supported a federal system of government and criticized the qualified suffrage. However, the 1826 Constitution promoted a strong centralized government and qualified suffrage.Galasso, pp. 258–260 Execution of Manuel Dorrego. Dorrego opposed the government of the unitarian Bernardino Rivadavia, who was appointed as the first president of Argentina, and voiced his criticism in the newspaper \\"El Tribuno\\". Resisted by all the provinces, Rivadavia resigned as president, and vice president Vicente López y Planes resigned as well. No longer having a national head of state, the legislature appointed Dorrego as governor of the Buenos Aires province. He took measures to support the poor, promote a federal organization of the country, and ended the Argentine–Brazilian War.Galasso, pp. 260–264 The Argentine troops were discontented with Dorrego because he accepted the conditions imposed by the British diplomacy despite their military victories in the conflict. Encouraged by the Unitarian party, Juan Lavalle led a coup against Dorrego on 1 December 1828. Dorrego left the city and organized his forces in the countryside. He was defeated, and then executed by Lavalle.Galasso, pp. 265–266 Lavalle closed the legislature and began a period of political violence against the Federals, but he was defeated and forced to resign by Juan Manuel de Rosas, who restored the institutions that existed before Lavalle's coup.Galasso, pp. 265–271 See also *Argentine Civil War *Manuel Dorrego national institute References Bibliography * Category:1787 births Category:1828 deaths Category:Leaders ousted by a coup Category:Governors of Buenos Aires Province Category:Executed politicians Category:Foreign ministers of Argentina Category:Argentine military personnel killed in the Argentine Civil War Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:People of the Argentine War of Independence Category:People executed by Argentina by firing squad Category:Executed Argentine people Category:Argentine people of Portuguese descent Category:Extrajudicial killings Category:Federales (Argentina) Category:Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery ","title":"Manuel Dorrego"},{"id":"3439292","text":"The Waccamaw Neck is a long narrow peninsula between the Atlantic Ocean and the Waccamaw River in Georgetown County, South Carolina.

Notable cultural locations are Brookgreen Gardens, Huntington Beach State Park, and the Belle Baruch Nature Preserve at Hobcaw Barony, a group of former plantation purchased between 1905 and 1910 as a hunting preserve by financier Bernard Baruch. The Waccamaw Neck Bikeway is part of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long system of trails that connects Maine to Florida.

About half of the pages are devoted to football, whereas the rest deals with athletics, auto racing, basketball, boxing, cycling, judo, karate, handball, tennis, shooting, skiing, swimming, volleyball, waterpolo, wrestling, and other olympic and non-olympic sports. This may slightly vary in the off-season or during big sporting events. Žurnal's first issue appeared in 17 May 1990, and it has since been published under the umbrella of Politika AD's family of newspapers and magazines (PNM). Controversy Known for spreading criticism of foreign players and supporting a discriminatory theory that foreign players should be welcomed only if they are \\"at least as double as good that a domestic player on same position\\" (an idea its chief editor regularly expresses in this, or similar, manner, in his chronicles), the newspaper had hard time condemning the racial abuse suffered by Brazilian FK Partizan player Everton Luiz, when, on 20 February 2017, in an away Serbian SuperLiga match against FK Rad, already notorious hooligans from the home side with a long portfolio of similar incidents, United Force, made continuous racist remarks and chants towards the Partizan player. Embarrassing chants of primitive behavior frequently even audible on the TV live transmission itself, culminated with an emotional outburst of the player in the 70th minute when he stopped the game and grabbed the ball with his hands while was in her possession and taking the racial abuse from the stand where the FK Rad supporters were. Feeling revolted, he was promptly supported by his teammates and technical stuff which despite their efforts couldn't prevent Everton from falling into a deeply emotional state of sadness which resulted in tears in front of cameras making the live transmission. The case had international coverage by the media, however, despite all, Sportski zurnal made a soft and balanced account of the event which after the initial report gave full space to the FK Rad vice-director, Jelena Polic, whose open defense of the racial abuse by the fans of her team created an even bigger worldwide condemnation.Serbian football chief tells racially abused rival player to \\"go back to Brazil and show your dark fingers\\" at mirror.co.uk, 22 February 2017. Retrieved 1 January 2020 Sportski zurnal limited to label as \\"scandalous\\" her allegations in the article title, while actually took the chance to transmit her allegations further explaining them and repeatedly referring to her as \\"lady\\" with one occasion even going as far as saying that those were the words of that \\"gorgeous lady\\".Skandalozno, kapitenka Rada i funkcioner Građevinara poručila Evertonu: „Ma, idi ti druže u svoj lepi Brazil, tamo pokazuj svoje tamnopute prstiće, psuj brazilsku majku...” at zurnal.rs, 22 February 2017 During the following months, Sportski zurnal made no interview whatsoever with Everton, kept their anti-foreigners overall narrative, and the culmination was a series of reports praising the fine work and excellent organisation Jelena Polic was doing by leading the woman's team of FK Rad. If there were any doubts on where the editorial board stands regarding that incident, they disappeared when at the end of the season Everton was clearly among the best players in the league, and deserved no exclusive space, while the \\"gorgeous lady\\" that praised and supported the racial abuse received exclusive news report glorifying her alleged beauty.FOTO UBOD: Polićeva mamila uzdahe na Banjici at zurnal.rs, 19 February 2019 Another recurring event in Sportski zurnal is to see constant differentiation between domestic and foreign players, with frequent outrageous blatant description of players as \\"dark- skinned\\".

Retrieved 1 January 2020 that being just one example of the usual description of a player by which subconsciously remind readers that it is a player of different skin colour they are referring to. Despite commentators having called the attention of this for already years, nothing has changed, and the redaction continues labeling sportists by their skin colour pretending to be totally unaware of the problems and harm it makes. In a country and a society that was quite avant-garde and progressive regarding racial tolerance and inter-ethnic exchange, especially during the period of Cold War when Yugoslavia lead the Non-Aligned movement and involved in the struggle for independence, decolonisation, and education of their own people of countries of the third world, time when Yugoslav companies got lucrative deals for major projects worldwide, and Yugoslav universities were filled with foreign exchange students, tolerance towards foreigners was at highest levels. Yugoslavia was accomplishing major successful results in numerous sports during the 1970s and 1980s and frequently their clubs became pioneer in bringing foreign signings compared to eastern-bloc countries. However, the start of the Yugoslav wars and the UN sanctions which imposed Serbian and Montenegrin teams absence from international competitions from 1992 till 1995 created a disastrous result for clubs in all modalities, which, without being able to fight for continental titles, ended making them loose theur main motivation. Clubs, which had just been European and International champions in football, as Red Star did in 1991, or KK Partizan in basketball same year, saw themselves having to search for new ways to survive, and most opted to start a massive selling of players to foreign clubs. By time sanctions were lifted and clubs could return to continental competitions, 3 years of wars, economic sanctions and record inflation which resulted in huge impoverishment of the society, meant clubs were no longer in the position of forming and keeping strong teams able to challenge the top ones, but rather had to continue surviving by selling players. Corruption, which had spread all over Serbian society, made its way into sports as a rapid spreading disease. Enjoying the reputation and value Yugoslav sportsman had archived in recent periods, obscure underground figures made their way into sports with its main purpose of expanding their fortunes by selling sportsman to top world clubs. The club's achievements became irrelevant, just as their results, which were only important to match the fixed outcomes for the betting agencies which from being inexistent in the late 1980s, were inaugurated by hundreds a week in any open corner. During the 1990s, football in Serbia saw its lowest possible, with frequent scenes that would be unimaginable elsewhere. As show-off of their power and judicial impotence, war-lords like Arkan took minor clubs, FK Obilić in his case, and made them champions in record time by successive promotions. Everyone simply knew they had to be the champions. Football, just as many other sports, was not played anymore competitivelly, and professionalism came to its lowest. There was no money from titles, sponsors were weak, attendances were low, and European competitions provided more expenses and obligations than profit. Locally, people turned to the only rentable outcome, convince the coach to \\"force\\" (Serbian: \\"forsira\\") your son in the team, and let's hope some foreign club notices him and split the money if they buy him. In this environment, foreigners became very unwelcome because they could only ruin the deal for the son by showing how crappy he is, and then, coaches often knew no foreign languages, so besides making enemies with one kid's family, he would also avoid making himself ridiculous by showing everyone that his English skills are absolute zero. Its in 1992 that all this starts and lasts strongly during the 1990s, while progressivelly, but very slowly and with many many setbacks, tries to improve somewhere since the mid-2000s. During this time, many great players from previous times, have splendid careers abroad, and some as coaches or others in other ways, tried to return to Serbia and bring their wisdom and knowledge to put it in service to improve local football by bringing the modern methods which demonstrably had been working elsewhere, but instead of a welcome and joy, they are received right the opposite way, as people who want to ruin the corrupt scheme of selling players and making money by fixing matches. It is precisely here that Sportski zurnal plays a crucial role. As the most popular sports newspaper, takes that advantage to manipulate public opinion and using a system of misleading and misinforming opinion articles, clearly backed by an entire group of sport workers whose role is elevated to statuses of \\"legend´s\\" and opinion, to statuses of mighty wisdom, clearly spends decades refusing to adapt to modern football, consider alternative views, and blatantly selectively chooses the space and time it provides to people sharing their opinion, against others. Instead of being an independent news agency, they became purely a weapon by which an identified group of foreigners-critics propagate their propaganda. Since there is clearly a major number of local coaches unable to find job outside Serbia and have difficulties in communicating with foreigners, while in the same time they believe that sparing the local youngsters from competition will improve their chances of being sold abroad, they firmly stick together defending the 4 foreigners limit per club, a limit radical as no other even nearly in Europe, despite Serbia being basically in Central Europe at EU doors. In what was once a popular place for commenting, today, there is clear censorship towards known commentators with opposing views of theirs, while in the same time they fill the comments section with one same person signing different names but unable to even disguise its writing style and use of same expressions. With their chief editor, Zoran Stojadinovic, making frequent articles in which repeatedly expresses the same view how foreigners are hurting \\"our children\\", it is the condoning of racial attacks such as the one Everton suffered and glorification of a person which responded him by sending him to him some land, that indicates that Sportski zurnal as a newspaper suffers serious problems regarding racism and \\"dark-skinned\\" sportists.

The hotel was established in May 1952 and the main building was completed on October 10, 1973. It is owned by the Duen-Mou Foundation of Taiwan, a non-profit organization, and has played host to many foreign dignitaries who have visited Taipei. The main building of the hotel is one of the world's tallest Chinese classical buildings at high. It was also the tallest building in Taiwan from 1973 to 1981. History After Chiang Kai-shek's retreat to Taiwan in 1949, Chiang felt it was difficult to accommodate foreign ambassadors due to the lack of five-star hotels in Taipei. He wanted to build an extravagant hotel that would cater to foreign guests. His wife Soong Mei-ling (Madame Chiang) suggested building it on the old Taiwan Hotel on Yuanshan Mountain, the site of the ruins of the Taiwan Grand Shrine, a Shinto shrine during the Japanese rule. Chiang decided on a Chinese palace-style architecture to promote Chinese culture to the West through its extravagance. Taipei-based architect Yang Cho-Cheng was responsible for the design of the new hotel. The hotel was established in May 1952, but it was expanded several times before it became the landmark as it is known today. The swimming pool, tennis court, and the membership lounge were constructed in 1953, and the Golden Dragon Pavilion and Golden Dragon Restaurant opened in 1956. The Jade Phoenix Pavilion and Chi-Lin Pavilion opened in 1958 and 1963, respectively. In 1968 the hotel was rated as one of the world's top ten hotels by the US Fortune magazine. Finally, on the Double Tenth Day in 1973, the main Grand Hotel building was completed and became an instant Taipei icon. In June 1995 a disastrous fire broke out on the roof of the main building during necessary reconstruction and refurbishment. As neither ladders nor high pressure pumps could reach the fire, the roof and the upper floors were destroyed. Not until 1998 did the hotel recover from the damage and fully reopen to the public. Following the fire, the two dragon heads on the roof were rotated 180 degrees to point inwards. As dragons are traditionally a symbol of rain and water, this was intended to symbolize preparedness against a future fire. Features =General features= With its vermilion columns, the roof makes the hotel a visible showcase of Chinese architecture and culture. The hotel itself contains numerous objets d'art, wall panels, paintings, carvings, and significant restaurants. Dragon motifs are frequently intertwined throughout the various structures that make up the hotel, earning the hotel the name \\"The Dragon Palace\\". Besides dragons, lion and plum flower motifs also make a significant presence in the hotel. Each of the eight guest levels represents a different Chinese dynasty, as reflected through the murals and general decor. The hotel has a total of 490 rooms. The rooms facing south offer guests a panoramic view of Taipei City. The presidential suite, as the hotel claims, contains former President Chiang Kai-shek's desk and Madame Chiang's dressing table. Currently the presidential suite costs NT$160,000 per night (Approx. US$4,850). Budget rooms are available from ca. $99 per night. The hotel also features auditoriums and meeting rooms, making it a popular venue for conventions and conferences in Taiwan. =Secret passages= Ever since the opening of the hotel, rumour had it that secret passages ran from the hotel to the nearby Shilin Official Residence and farther out to the Presidential Office Building for Chiang's convenience.http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/taiwan- issues/2010/09/25/273824/Whats-in.htm The truth was uncovered after the 1995 fire as part of the safety commission that was conducted. The secret passages were revealed to be two air-raid tunnels, each of them 180 m in length leading to nearby parks, not to the presidential residence or the emergency headquarters as rumours had suggested. The western passage is equipped with a slide for the disabled as an alternative to the spiraling stairs. The exits are obscured by concrete walls, thus escaping public detection for decades. The tunnels have a maximum capacity of about 10,000 people. As of 2005 the tunnels were closed to the public except for special events, when hotel officials invite the press and public inside the tunnels for a tour. Notable guests * Dwight D. Eisenhower – The only American president who visited Taiwan (18-19 June 1960) while still in power. * Richard Nixon – Stayed at the hotel during an Asian trip in 1965 * Ronald Reagan * Bill Clinton * Warren Christopher – His arrival from nearby Sungshan Airport in 1978 was delayed several hours by crowds throwing eggs and screaming protests over U.S. President Jimmy Carter's decision to break relations with Taiwan. *Benigno \\"Ninoy\\" Aquino, Jr. – Stayed at the hotel the night before his assassination on August 21, 1983 * Nelson MandelaIron Chef: \\"Dried Abalone Battle,\\" Season 4, episode 2, January 12, 1996. * Margaret Thatcher * Shigeru Yoshida * Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi * King Hussein of Jordan * Lee Kuan Yew – Stayed at least 14 times and once was so impressed with the level of service that he requested that the hotel butler accompany him throughout his visit to Taiwan. * The King of Thailand, Bhumibol Adulyadej and his wife, Queen Sirikit Kitiyakara, 1963 Notable events * Sixth Chen–Chiang summit (20–22 December 2010) * House of Bishops Meeting of the Episcopal Church (17–23 September 2014)https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/2014/09/17/house-of-bishops-begins- historic-meeting-in-taiwan/ In popular culture * The Taipei Grand Hotel was featured in the 1994 film Eat Drink Man Woman by Taiwanese film director Ang Lee. * A level in the 2010 videogame Alpha Protocol is set here. * Major Motoko Kusanagi stays at the hotel in an episode of Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG. * A scene from the third season premiere of the American sitcom Fresh off the Boat was filmed in the hotel. * The hotel's lobby hosted the Finish Line for the third season of the Israeli edition of The Amazing Race.

Geography The town is located in the heart of the Chartreuse Mountains 25 kilometers north of Grenoble. Etymology The town was earlier known as Catorissium, Cantourisa, Caturissium, and Chatrousse.Oxford English Dictionary, 1st edition, 1888 s.v. The name is of Gaulish origin;Juan Luis García Alonso, Continental Celtic Word Formation: The Onomastic Data, p. 42 and is perhaps related to the name of the Caturiges tribe.Robert Ellis, A Treatise on Hannibal's Passage of the Alps, 1853, p. 174 History The town is mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana under the name Catorissium, and in the Ravenna Cosmography as Cantourisa.

In the early twentieth century, tourism took an important place, including the construction of the 'Grand Som' high- end hotel that hosted famous guests including Queen Victoria of England for example. The village was rated weather resort in the 1930s and people came here to recharge, visit the monastery of the Grande Chartreuse (which was open to the public between 1903, date of the expulsion of the monks, until 1940 date of their return from Italy).

Additionally, beginning in 2018 he is a lead commentator for the Seven Sport test cricket coverage. Between 2003 and 2011 he was also an AFL commentator for Network Ten. Lane is well known for commentating on a variety of sports, in particular cricket for decades. As well as AFL and as a track and field commentator for both the Summer Olympics and Commonwealth Games. He famously called Cathy Freeman for ABC Grandstand radio at the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Early career Born in Launceston, Lane moved with his family to Devonport in 1963 and matriculated from Devonport High School in 1969. Lane then studied at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, where he resided at St. John Fisher College, but after failing first year found work at an Edgell factory before trying sports commentary. Lane began his sports broadcasting career in 1972 and was employed by the ABC in 1973, commentating NTFA Australian rules football matches. Established media career After some time working for the ABC in Hobart, Lane moved to Melbourne in 1979, where he has been based since. Lane began calling a wide variety of sports, including tennis, cricket, athletics and Australian rules football matches in the Victorian Football League and Australian Football League.

Having been recruited to Nine's AFL commentary team, Lane quit just days prior to the season's commencement, claiming Nine had refused to honour a stipulation in his contract that Eddie McGuire would not commentate alongside him in matches involving the Collingwood Football Club. Lane held the view that McGuire's role as Collingwood president put him in a conflict of interest, as his freedom to report matters regarding the club would be compromised by his requirement to keep certain inside knowledge confidential.

Branches of the family have since settled in the United States. Migration through the years The immigration history of the Mucciolo and Muccioli family is extensive. The beginning of this history has been documented by the Vittorio Spreti, the historical encyclopedia for Italian nobility which traces the Mucciolo lineage to Spain, where the family was formed following the merger of the Spanish towns of Mulcios and Orosos Albos not far from Toledo. The Mucciolo family faced particular hardships following the Moorish invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 because of their noble status as Dukes with the prior Christian monarchy. As a result of these hardships, somewhere around 1000, the Mucciolo family left Spain as political and religious refugees and immigrated to Marchigiana where the first Italian generations were born. Somewhere between 1600 and 1750 a branch of the Mucciolo settled in Castel San Lorenzo, located in Salerno just outside Naples, where over 70 families of the Mucciolo line are known to live today. Notable branches of the family also migrated to the United States (Mocciolo) as well as San Marino and Bologna. Of these branches the most successful have been those who migrated to San Marino where the family has been able to continue to enjoy the \\"prestige of nobility and wealth.\\" Many of these San Marino Mucciolos (over the generations the name has changed to Muccioli in San Marino) have served as the Capitani Reggenti (Ruling Captain). The Capitani Reggenti is the head of the executive branch of government, San Marino's equivalent of a president or prime minister. The most recent of the Mucciolo family Capitani Reggenti is Claudio Muccioli whose term ended in April 2006. Social standing in Spain On April 12, 1920, King Alfonso XIII of Spain re- recognized the Mucciolos in Spain, as well as those in San Marino, Bologna and Castel San Lorenzo as Spanish nobility, confirming that all the \\"family Mucciolo\\" was nobility and restoring the title of Duke.

Although its operational career was short, it was the first of the Albatros D types which equipped the bulk of the German and Austrian fighter squadrons (Jagdstaffeln) for the last two years of the war. Design and development The D.I was designed by Robert Thelen, R. Schubert and Gnädig, as an answer to the latest Allied fighters, such as the Nieuport 11 Bébé and the Airco D.H.2, which had proved superior to the Fokker Eindecker and other early German fighters, and established a general Allied air superiority. It was ordered in June 1916 and introduced into squadron service that August.Cheesman 1960, p. 108. The D.I had a semi-monocoque plywood fuselage, consisting of a single- layered outer shell, supported by a minimal internal structure. This was lighter and stronger than the fabric-skinned box-type fuselage then in common use, as well being easier to give an aerodynamically clean shape. At the same time its panelled-plywood skinning, done with mostly four-sided panels of thin plywood over the entire minimal fuselage structure, was less labour-intensive (and therefore less costly to manufacture) than a \\"true\\" monocoque structure.Gray and Thetford 1970, p. 39. The Albatros D.I was powered by either a Benz Bz.III or a Mercedes D.III six-cylinder water cooled inline engine. The additional power of the Mercedes (Daimler) engine enabled twin fixed Spandau machine-guns to be fitted without any loss in performance. The D.I had a relatively high wing loading for its time, and was not particularly manoeuvrable. This was compensated by its superior speed and firepower and it quickly proved the best all-round fighter available. Operational history A total of 50 pre-series and series D.I aircraft were in service by November 1916, replacing the early Fokker and Halberstadt D types, giving real \\"teeth\\" to the Luftstreitkräfte's new Jagdstaffeln (fighter squadrons). Further production of D.Is was not undertaken, however; instead, a reduction in the gap between the upper and lower wing in order to improve the pilot's forward and upward vision resulted in the otherwise identical Albatros D.II, which became Albatros' first major production fighter.

His rescue and that of William Jimeno is the subject of the Oliver Stone film World Trade Center released in 2006, in which McLoughlin was portrayed by Nicolas Cage. McLoughlin graduated from the State University of New York at Oswego, where he was a member of the Sigma Tau Chi fraternity. September 11, 2001 McLoughlin led a team of officers, including Jimeno, who were on the main concourse between the two towers when the South Tower collapsed. The five ran toward a nearby freight elevator, and were buried in the ensuing collapse of the concourse. Officers Antonio Rodrigues and Chris Amoroso were killed immediately. McLoughlin, Jimeno and a third officer, Dominick Pezzulo, were trapped but alive. The freight elevator withstood the devastation, creating breathing room that saved their lives. Pezzulo, who was the only one not pinned, immediately managed to free himself and tried to free Jimeno, but the subsequent collapse of the North Tower caused shifting and additional debris falling through. Pezzulo was mortally wounded and died minutes after the collapse. McLoughlin and Jimeno were rescued after former U.S. Marine Corps sergeant Jason Thomas and staff sergeant Dave Karnes heard their cries for help about ten hours after they were first buried. The two men were eventually rescued after hours of painstaking work — Jimeno after 13 hours and McLoughlin after 22 hours. McLoughlin was gravely injured. Doctors kept him in an induced coma for six weeks. He underwent 27 surgeries and spent nearly three months in the hospital and rehabilitation. Four months after their rescue, McLoughlin and Jimeno — who both have since retired — took part in a ceremony at Ground Zero to watch as the final column was removed. When all the uniformed officers walked out of The Pit, the last two were last to leave. Only 20 people were pulled out of the rubble alive, Jimeno and McLoughlin were numbers 18 and 19. On June 11, 2002, McLoughlin (with a walker) and Jimeno (with a limp) walked across a stage at Madison Square Garden to receive the Port Authority's Medal of Honor.

Biography Belle Baruch was born on August 16, 1899, the daughter of Bernard Mannes Baruch and Annie Griffin. Her paternal grandfather was Simon Baruch, a physician. Her uncle was Herman B. Baruch, also a physician. Baruch was a noted athlete who excelled as an equestrian, sailor and hunter. In 1930 and 1931, she was awarded the President of the Republic's Cup for winning the classic competition in the Paris horse show and, in the 1931 competition, she was the only one of 119 contestants to post a perfect score. All told, she won more than 300 prizes in competitions in France and other countries. When the U.S. embassy in France would not issue her a license to ride in international shows because she was a woman, she obtained one from the French. She was, however, unable to achieve her ambition of competing in the Olympics as women could not join the equestrian team before 1956. Legacy Her legacy is preserved in the Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences (University of South Carolina) and the Belle W. Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology & Forest Science (Clemson University) both established on Hobcaw Barony, a former rice plantation purchased by her father. Upon her death in 1964, the property was transferred to the Belle W. Baruch FoundationFoundation website for the creation of a nature and research preserve.

Early life Bennett was born at Plymouth, England. On leaving school at 15 years of age he visited Ceylon and on his return studied for the medical profession, initially at Plymouth, later at the Middlesex Hospital and the Hunterian School of Medicine. He obtained the degree of M.R.C.S. on 7 March 1828, and later became F.R.C.S. Career After qualifying as a physician Bennett obtained employment as a ship's surgeon, and visited Sydney, New South Wales, in 1829. ln 1832 his friend Richard Owen was engaged in examining the structure and relations of the mammary glands of the Ornithorhyncus, and Bennett became so interested that on leaving England shortly afterwards for Australia he determined while in that country to find a solution of the question. In May 1832 Bennett left Plymouth on a voyage which terminated almost exactly two years later. An account of this appeared in 1834 in two volumes under the title Wanderings in New South Wales, Batavia, Pedir Coast, Singapore and China. In 1835 Bennett published in the Transactions of the Zoological Society of London, vol. I, pp. 229–58, \\"Notes on the Natural History and Habits of the Ornithorhyncus paradoxus, Blum\\", one of the earliest papers of importance written on the platypus. In 1833, Bennett lent support in absentia to the founding of what became the Royal Entomological Society of London. Bennett was awarded the honorary gold medal of the Royal College of Surgeons in recognition of his contributions to zoological science. Bennett went to Australia again in 1836 and established a successful practice as a physician at Sydney. However he kept up his general interest in science, and acted as honorary secretary of the Australian Museum which had just been established. He compiled A Catalogue of the Specimens of Natural History and Miscellaneous Curiosities deposited in the Australian Museum which was published in 1837. In 1860 he brought out his Gatherings of a Naturalist in Australasia. He kept up a correspondence with his early friend Sir Richard Owen, to whom he had sent the first specimens of the Nautilus to arrive in England, and with Darwin and other scientists of the time. He was much interested in the Sydney Botanic Gardens and the Acclimatization Society, and was a vice-president of the Zoological Society, and a member of the board of the Australian Museum. George Bennett in late life Bennett also contributed papers to The Lancet, the Medical Gazette, the Journal of Botany, Loudon's Magazine of Natural History, and other journals. The variety of his interests may be suggested by the fact that he published in 1871 papers on \\"A Trip to Queensland in Search of Fossils\\" and on \\"The Introduction, Cultivation and Economic Uses of the Orange and Others of the Citron Tribe\\". Late life and legacy Bennett was 84 years of age when he contributed the chapter on \\"Mammals\\" to the Handbook of Sydney, prepared for the Sydney meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science held in 1888.

It is located from the center of Paris. History The commune was created in 1791 under the name La Branche-du-Pont-de-Saint-Maur (literally \\"The Branch of Saint-Maur's Bridge\\") by detaching its territory from the commune of Saint- Maur-des-Fossés. The commune was renamed Joinville-le-Pont (literally \\"Joinville the Bridge\\") on 29 August 1831. Under Louis-Philippe of France, the Redoute de Gravelle was built in the commune. In 1929, the commune of Joinville-le-Pont lost more than a third of its territory when the city of Paris annexed the Bois de Vincennes, a part of which belonged to Joinville-le- Pont. Transport Joinville-le-Pont is served by Joinville-le-Pont station on Paris RER line A.

The album compiles material previously released on two 10 inch LPs in 1954 (Miles Davis All-Star Sextet and Side One of Miles Davis Quintet, dropping I’ll Remember April from Side Two (which had been on the 12” LP Blue Haze, released the previous year, itself a collection of tunes from previous 10” LPs) and replacing it with the previously unreleased Love Me or Leave Me recorded at the same session. Here credited to the \\"Miles Davis All- Stars\\", the songs were recorded on 3 April and 29 April 1954 by two slightly different groups led by Davis. Both sessions were recorded at Rudy Van Gelder's home studio. The earlier session was a quintet with David Schildkraut on alto saxophone, and produced the three tracks on side two. Schildkraut is the only musician not credited on the cover, and is otherwise almost unknown. Two of these tracks were originally released on the 10\\" LP Miles Davis Quintet, Prestige PRLP 185. The earlier release also included \\"I'll Remember April\\", recorded at the same time, now found on the Prestige album Blue Haze (PRLP 7054).April 3, 1954 Session Details, Miles Ahead: A Miles Davis Website, accessed May 26, 2014 Another tune from this session, \\"Love Me or Leave Me,\\" was previously unreleased and substituted here for \\"I'll Remember April.\\" The second session, which makes up all of side one, was a sextet with J. J. Johnson on trombone and Lucky Thompson on tenor saxophone. The rhythm section was the same as the earlier session. These two tracks were originally issued on the 10\\" LP Miles Davis All-Star Sextet PRLP 182.April 29, 1954 Session Details, Miles Ahead: A Miles Davis Website, accessed May 22, 2014 The album's title track, a staple of Davis's live set for many years, was key to the emerging hard bop approach developed in the mid-1950s, Davis providing it with an anthem. The composition has been attributed by various sources to Jimmy Mundy, Miles Davis, and Gene Ammons. The copyright registration listed the composer as Richard E. Carpenter, a businessman and artist manager who had professional relationships with Mundy and Tadd Dameron, and was not known to be a musician or composer. \\"Solar\\" was attributed to Davis and copyrighted in his name in 1963. Evidence revealed in 2012 showed that it is nearly identical to \\"Sonny\\", a piece written by guitarist Chuck Wayne in the 1940s, so Wayne is regarded as the composer of \\"Solar\\".
