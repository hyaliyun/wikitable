She is also a rapier fencer specializing in La Verdadera Destreza. Early life R√≠os began drawing as a child and is a self-taught artist. As a young adult, R√≠os attended University of A Coru√±a for architecture and afterwards worked as an architect for a few years while publishing comics on the side in fanzines. In 2008, she refocused her career on comics.  Career  In the same year R√≠os resigned from architecture, she participated in Lingua Comica, a transnational comics workshop program funded by the Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF). R√≠os has related in interviews that she did not feel like a real comics artist until she was selected for the program alongside Hwei Lim, with whom she currently co-creates Mirror. Shortly afterwards, she began to work for several comics publishers in the United States. Prior to resigning from architecture, R√≠os began her career in comics by self-publishing zines in her teenage years. Over time, R√≠os was a regular contributor to the Galicia, Spain-based small press and fanzine Polaquia.

R√≠os accredits Waid for pushing her to pursue a career in Marvel comics, where she has worked on many titles including The Amazing Spider-man, Runaways, Girl Comics, and Osborn, a mini-series about the Spider- man villain Norman Osborn. R√≠os partnered with Kelly Sue Deconnick for Osborn, whom she worked on several other projects with across multiple publishers. R√≠os and Deconnick joined forces for Pretty Deadly, an award-winning and ongoing western/fantasy series published by Image Comics. Deconnick and R√≠os collaborated previously at Image for ‚ÄúRailbirds‚Äù, a graphic reflection and tribute written by Deconnick for her friend, the late slam-poet Maggie Estep a year after her death. This appeared in Island magazine, a monthly comics anthology published from 2015 to 2017, which R√≠os co-edited and contributed to with Brandan-Graham. Although the magazine has since ended, R√≠os has spoken favorably of her work with the magazine. Her own solo story in Island, I.D, was also released as a solo graphic novel.

Description War is a large pastel on paper composition measuring 1600mm x 1200mm. A rabbit-headed woman stands prominently in the center carrying a wounded child, surrounded by several realistic and fantastical figures recalling a style Rego describes as \\"beautiful grotesque\\". For The Telegraph's Alastair Sooke, \\"The more you look at War, the curiouser and curiouser it becomes. Rego's white rabbits owe more to Richard Kelly's film Donnie Darko than Lewis Carroll's Wonderland.\\" Background The painting first appeared as part of Rego's \\"Jane Eyre and Other Stories\\" exhibition at Marlborough Fine Art in London in 2003. It was inspired by a photograph that appeared in The Guardian near the beginning of the Iraq War, in which a girl in a white dress is seen running from an explosion, with a woman and her baby unmoving behind her. In an interview conducted in relation to the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a's 2007 exhibition, Rego said of this painting, \\"I thought I would do a picture about these children getting hurt, but I turned them into rabbits' heads, like masks. It‚Äôs very difficult to do it with humans, it doesn‚Äôt get the same kind of feel at all. It seemed more real to transform them into creatures.\\" The composition features several recurring themes and motifs in Rego's work including social criticism, sexuality, and rabbits or fairy tale imagery generally. Rego donated War to the Tate's permanent collection in 2005.

She was also one of a small group of botanical illustrators who worked for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the early 20th century. Early life and education Elsie E. Lower was born September 30, 1882 in New Castle, Pennsylvania. She was the daughter of Cyrus B. Lower, a decorated Union Army American Civil War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient. She grew up in Washington D.C. and graduated from the Corcoran School of Art in the early 1900s. USDA illustrator Rose d'Italie grape, created for the USDA. By 1908, she was working as an artist for the USDA, drawing botanical illustrations for the USDA yearbooks. She was one of a select cohort of botanical illustrators working for the USDA at this time, among whom were also Deborah Griscom Passmore, Ellen Isham Schutt, Royal Charles Steadman, and Amanda Newton. She painted over 280 watercolors for the USDA, including both common fruits such as citrus, apples, and strawberries, and less common fruits such as cherimoyas. The 1908 USDA yearbook contained two of her images, including the Augbert peach (pg. 479) and Kawakami and Lonestar persimmons (pg. 484). The 1909 USDA yearbook contained two of her images, including an ear of corn (pg. 335) and the Diploma currant (pg. 414). Unlike most of her USDA colleagues, she would go on to have a career as an exhibiting artist after she left the service. Elsie E. Lower watercolor of diseased Eureka lemon (Citrus limon) In 1911, she married Carl Stone Pomeroy, a young pomologist at the USDA. By 1913, the couple had moved to Riverside, California, where Carl joined the Citrus Experiment Station and helped to develop the navel orange/citrus industry in Southern California. California painter While in Riverside, she began studies and friendships with Millard Sheets, Phil Dike, and Eliot O'Hara and was a member of the Riverside Art Association. During this time, she completed a series of four watercolors about the citrus industry in Riverside. These paintings were exhibited throughout the United States, won numerous awards, and are currently in the permanent collection at the University of California at Riverside. In 1935, she went to Washington, D.C., where she was employed as a botanical artist for several months by the U.S. Forestry Service. It was during this trip that she did studies for her painting \\"Melting Snow\\", which is now in the collection of the Butler Institute of American Art in Ohio. In the mid 1940s Elsie and Carl moved to Mill Valley in Marin County, California. An ardent nature lover, Elsie traveled throughout the state capturing the California scene. Her subjects included everything from Death Valley and coastal scenes to the Spanish missions and San Francisco cityscapes. She maintained her close ties with other California Scene painters such as Sheets, Rex Brandt, Milford Zornes, Emil Kosa, Jr. and Phil Paradise. Even in her early 80s she was painting and traveling with Sheets to San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Elsie lived in Marin County to the end of her life and was a member of the Marin Society of Artists. She died in 1971 in Mill Valley, California leaving behind hundreds of watercolors, oils, and drawings. Her USDA watercolors are now part of the USDA Pomological Watercolor Collection. Although not as well known as her male contemporaries, her work exemplifies the California Scene Painting movement from the 1920s-50s period. Her primary mediums were watercolor and oil, but she also did drawings and used tempera.

Camille Henrot Camille Henrot (born 1978) is a French artist who lives and works in Paris and New York. Biography Henrot was born in 1978 in Paris, France. She attended the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Arts D√©coratifs where she studied film animation and soon after helped assist Pierre Huyghe who worked in advertising and making music videos. She is based in New York and her work includes video installation, sculpture, drawing, and assemblage. She has worked with many diverse forms of media such as ethnographic film, the zoetrope, telephone hotlines and ikebana. Henrot has had solo exhibitions at the Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA), the Kunsthal Charlottenborg, the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux, the Mus√©e d'art contemporain de Montr√©al, the New Museum, and the New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA).  Works  = Grosse Fatigue = Grosse Fatigue is a 13-minute color video that includes videos of screens, bodies, computer desktop, and computer windows. Henrot created Grosse Fatigue during her 2013 fellowship at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. The video makes use of themes such as insanity, madness, euphoria, and information overload. The work was presented during the Venice Biennale, upon the invitation of curator Massimiliano Gioni. With Grosse Fatigue, Henrot set herself the challenge of telling the story of the universe‚Äôs creation. The text that provides the audio component of the work was written in collaboration with Jacob Bromberg, performed by artist Akwetey Orraca-Tetteh, and accompanied with music was composed by Joakim. = The Pale Fox = In 2014 the Chisenhale Gallery in London, in partnership with Kunsthal Charlottenborg, Copenhagen, B√©tonsalon ‚Äì Centre for art and research, Paris and Westf√§lischer Kunstverein, M√ºnster, commissioned The Pale Fox, an exhibition comprising an architectural display system, found objects, drawing, bronze and ceramic sculpture and digital images. The exhibition consisted of architectural display systems, found objects, drawings, bronze and ceramic sculpture and digital images. The project purports to articulate our desire to make sense of the world through the objects that surround us. A catalogue of the show, entitled Elephant Child, was published in 2016 by Inventory Press and Koenig Books. = \\"Bad Dad & Beyond\\" series = In 2015, Camille began a series of works that ponder the nature of authority figures. This series involved watercolors, interactive sculptures, and a zoetrope. For an exhibition at Metro Pictures, Henrot created a number of 3D printed telephones that connect to surrealist hotlines. = Saturday = Saturday is a 20-minute 3-D film that immerses the viewer into the religious practices of the Seventh-day Adventists, using footage of baptisms in the United States, Tonga, and Tahiti as a metaphor for resurrection and spiritual change. The work was part of the exhibit ‚ÄúDays Are Dogs‚Äù at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in 2017. = Monday = This exhibition was held at Fondazione Memmo a museum in Rome, and is inspired by the first day of the week, Monday. It is made up of various bronze sculptures that are somewhere in between the figurative and abstract which depict the feelings some may experience during this day of the week. = Egyptomania = This slideshow shows pictures of objects related to Ancient Egyptian Art that were found on sale in 2009 on eBay. This slideshow attempts to answer the many unanswered questions about why this civilization is so influential through this compilation of images that create a mental fantasy Ancient Egypt. The associations between these objects was either symbolic or formal and included similarities in product or repetition of symbols such as pyramids and mummies which ties back to many perceptions people have with this culture. = Endangered Species = Endangered Species is a set of sculptures made up of car engine hoses from cars with wild animal names such as Ford, Mustang and Opel Tigra. These car productions have stopped and relate back to the idea of what is destined to disappear and this idea of ecological threat shifting into the automobile industry, therefore inspiring Henrot to use some shapes from Bambara masks from Mali for her sculptures. = Sphinx = This collection of drawings is made up of oil pastel on standard A4 paper which are exhibited on a metal board held up by magnets. They are an experiment of what happens to a form when it is repeated by hand to the point of exhaustion? Henrot repeats this drawing of a Sphinx onto dozens of sheets of paper until it almost becomes like a structured abstract pattern instead of a drawing. This brings up the question of where is the borderline between repeated decorative and narrative which might cause an object to have no meaning and simply becomes a decorative pattern.  Public Commissions  In 2016 Henrot created the piece Ma Montagne (My Mountain) at Pailherols, Cantal, France. Honors and awards In 2010 Henrot was nominated for the Marcel Duchamp prize. She won the Silver Lion Award at the Venice Biennale in 2013 for Grosse Fatigue. In 2014, she was a finalist for the Hugo Boss Prize. In 2014, she was a finalist for the Absolut Art Award. The same year she won the Nam June Paik Award. In 2015 she was awarded the Edvard Munch prize .

Younge was an enlisted service member in the United States Navy, where he served for two years before being medically discharged. Younge was an active member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and a leader of the Tuskegee Institute Advancement League. Younge was the first African-American university student to be murdered in the United States due to his actions in support of the Civil Rights Movement. Three days after his death, SNCC became the first civil rights organization in the United States to oppose the Vietnam War, partly on the grounds that like Younge, innocent civilians should not face deadly violence. Early life Younge was born on November 17, 1944, in Tuskegee, Alabama. His father, Samuel Younge Sr., was an occupational therapist, and his mother was a local schoolteacher. From the age of 12 to 14, from 1956 to 1958, Younge attended Cornwall Academy, in Massachusetts. He graduated from Tuskegee Institute High School in 1962, after which he joined the United States Navy. Younge served in the United States Navy from 1962 until July 1964, when he was given a medical discharge as a result of having to have one of his kidneys removed. Upon his discharge from the Navy, Younge began attending the Tuskegee Institute, in 1965, as a political science student. Civil rights activism Younge became involved in the Civil Rights Movement during his first semester at the Tuskegee Institute. He participated in the Selma to Montgomery protest march in Montgomery, Alabama, against the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" incident in March 1965. Younge joined the SNCC and the Tuskegee Institute for Advancement League (TIAL) ‚Äî a local civil rights student group formed with the help of the SNCC. He soon started helping to lead protests by the organizations against civil rights infractions in Alabama. Then, in April 1965, he went to Mississippi and worked with Unita Blackwell and Fannie Lou Hamer to help the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party get black voters registered. In the Summer of 1965, Younge lead Tuskegee Institute students in challenging overt discrimination in Tuskegee. The group attempted to enter white restaurants, held rallies, and picketed establishments that refused to hire black people. Several times they attempted to attend segregated white churches and were brutally beaten twice. In September 1965, Younge was arrested and jailed after attempting to drive a group of African-Americans to get registered to vote in Lee County, Alabama. Younge continued his efforts to get blacks registered to vote in Macon County, Alabama four months after being released from jail, up until his death. Death Younge was shot in the face (under the left eye) p.3-4 https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/949026/download by Marvin Segrest, a 68-year-old white gas station attendant at a Standard Oil station in Tuskegee, Alabama, on January 3, 1966. The shooting came after a verbal altercation between Younge and the attendant about Younge using the \\"whites- only\\" bathroom. Younge became the first black college student to be murdered for his actions in support of the Civil Rights Movement. Samuel Younge Sr. said of his son's death, \\"This is an era of social revolution. In such revolutions, individuals sacrifice their lives.\\" Trial On January 4, 1966, Segrest was arrested, but released on $20,000 bond. He was indicted for murder in the second degree and tried on December 7. The trial was moved from Macon County, where blacks outnumbered whites by a 2-1 margin, to Lee County. He was found not guilty by an all-white jury the next day. His acquittal sparked outraged protests in Tuskegee. Tributes In January 1966, a protest was staged in front of the White House by Leslie Bayless, with a coffin with a picture of Younge attached to it. The protest was staged to call out the white supremacy caused shooting of Younge in Alabama. Police forcibly removed the casket and arrested Bayless for disorderly conduct. =SNCC reaction= After Younge's death, the SNCC decided to publicly join the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War; stating officially, on January 6, 1966, that: > The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee has a right and a > responsibility to dissent with United States foreign policy on any issue > when it sees fit. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee now states > its opposition to United States' involvement in Vietnam on these grounds: We > believe the United States government has been deceptive in its claims of > concern for the freedom of the Vietnamese people, just as the government has > been deceptive in claiming concern for the freedom of colored people in such > other countries as the Dominican Republic, the Congo, South Africa, > Rhodesia, and in the United States itself. ... The murder of Samuel [Younge] > in Tuskeegee, Alabama, is no different than the murder of peasants in > Vietnam, for both [Younge] and the Vietnamese sought, and are seeking, to > secure the rights guaranteed them by law.

Early history The church was established as a direct result of the Religious Revival of 1859, when fifty members were released from Ebenezer, Trecynon to establish a new church in the mining village of Cwmdare. Originally, meetings were held in a vestry but in August 1867 a new chapel was opened, when services were addressed by a number of ministers including David Price of Siloa, Aberdare. ¬£200 was raised towards the cost which was recognised as a significant achievement given that all members of the church were workmen. The mother church at Ebenezer was also recognised as giving significant support to Elim. The first minister was Abraham Matthews, who came from Bala College to minister at Elim together with Horeb, Llwydcoed. David Griffiths, a student from Brecon College, was inaugurated as minister at Elim in June 1869. He was a native of Llanarth, Cardiganshire and had migrated to Dowlais when around twenty years of age having previously worked as a farm labourer. Griffiths was urged to commence preaching by the minister at Bethania, Dowlais. Griffiths served for a time as a member of the Aberdare School Board. He remained at Elim until his death. Twentieth Century In 1903, the chapel was rebuilt. A memorial stone was laid on 11 August 1902 by Rees Llewellyn of Bwllfa House, Cwmdare and J.W. Evans of Hirwaun. In February 1906, David Griffiths died at the age of 65 having spent 37 years as minister of Elim. David Owen Davies was minister from 1961 until his retirement in 1981. He died in 1989. The chapel eventually closed in 1998.

His taxonomic studies of 71 new species dating back to 1927 enhanced the development of mosquito systematics and established the knowledge base for these winged vectors of the highly infectious tropical disease, malaria. His works contributed greatly to the control of malaria, severe cases of which even today can lead to death - 627,000 in 2012 alone according to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The first Filipino to be trained as a malaria technician by the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation, Baisas later was employed as an entomologist by the US Army's 3rd General Medical Laboratory and the Philippine's Institute of Malariology under whose auspices he conducted most of his life work. In 1955, the Philippine Government named him among the country's Ten Outstanding Scientists, awarding him a gold medal and a Diploma of Honor for his contributions to the study of malaria and mosquitoes in the Philippines. A prolific author who published scholarly scientific works almost to his dying day, his publications are archived at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC where specimen plates of the mosquito species he discovered and therefore carry his name are also preserved (catalogued as \\"F. Baisas Scientific Works, Smithsonian, Washington DC, South East Asia Mosquito Project, NHB455\\"). Some of his works, were also published by the Chicago Natural History Museum (now the Field Museum). A tireless researcher, he continued his work even in retirement, establishing his now defunct Baisas Entomological Research Laboratory in the backyard of his home in Pasig, a Manila suburb, where he wrote his perhaps most voluminous publication, the scrupulously illustrated, 300-page downloadable book entitled The Mosquito Fauna of Subic Bay Naval Reservation, published in the early 1970s, which details the taxonomy of some 90 mosquito species and subspecies in this area alone. The mosquito species named after him are often the subject vector of research studies on malaria being carried out to this day in laboratories all over the world, e.g., Anopheles baisasi among others, and often cited in the title and body of research papers on mosquito taxonomyhttp://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pi/pdf/1(1)-1-38.pdf and the prevention of malaria.http://imsear.hellis.org/bitstream/123456789/33606/2/68.pdf Francisco E.

Personal life He was born in the Philippines in the arts-and-crafts town of Paete, Laguna on June 4, 1896, the younger of two children of Lorenzo Baisas, a farmer who tilled his own land, and his wife Juana Edlagan.

She has exhibited extensively internationally, including solo exhibitions at MoMA PS1, La Conservera, Spain, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Dallas Museum of Art. Gallace's work was included in the 2010 Whitney Biennial. Early life and education Gallace was born in Stamford, Connecticut in 1960. She received her BFA from The Hartford Art School, University of Hartford in 1981 and her MFA from Rutgers University in 1983. Career Gallace paints intimately sized landscapes of houses and beaches devoid of people. She has been inspired by the rural New England landscape. Her process involves careful observation, omission, attention to brushstroke, color, and composition. Gallace describes the process of arriving at her streamlined representations as staring at something and breaking it down to what she finds most important. In a review of her show at 303 Gallery in New York in 2015, Peter Schjeldahl surmised that her aim is \\"description, not of how things look but of how they seem.\\"Schjeldahl, Peter (October 19, 2015). \\"America at the Edges.\\" The New Yorker p. 96\\\\. Retrieved via Biography in Context database, 13 September 2017. In Gallace's oil painting Cape Cod, Early September (2008) there is a simplified white cottage in the center surrounded by a pale blue sky and bright greenery. This painting was a part of the 2010 Whitney Biennial. She creates paintings with visible brushstrokes by painting wet on wet layers of oil on panel. Her technique flattens the perspective in the picture. She excludes details on the cottage, which allows viewers to make their own associations with the image. Gallace's work relates to early American Modernist painting, especially Edward Hopper's representations of small towns and Milton Avery's abstracted seascapes. Schjeldahl also suggests it has kinship with the still lifes of the mid-20th-century Italian painter Giorgio Morandi. Bruce Hainley selected Beach No. 2 (2013) as the \\"Best of 2013\\" in the December 2013 issue of Artforum. He wrote: > Gallace ... makes some of the most intense paintings going. Luminous grays, > glissandos of white, and auroral pinks and oranges dramatize her precise > blues.

Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Margaret Neilson Armstrong (1867‚Äì1944) was a 20th-century American designer, illustrator, and author. She is best known for her book covers in the Art Nouveau style. She also wrote and illustrated the first comprehensive guide to wildflowers of the American west, Field Book of Western Wild Flowers (1915). In later life she wrote mystery novels and biographies. Life Margaret Neilson Armstrong was born on September 24, 1867, in New York City, the daughter of American diplomat and stained glass artist Maitland Armstrong and his wife Helen, who was a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant and a niece of Hamilton Fish.Evans, Curtis. \\"Had I But Known Authors #2: Margaret Armstrong, HIBK Patrician\\". The Passing Tramp (blog), January 28, 2012. Her six siblings included Helen Maitland Armstrong (1869‚Äì1948), who followed in her father's footsteps to become a stained glass artist, and Hamilton Fish Armstrong, a magazine editor. She began her career as a designer in the 1880s, working initially for A.C. McClurg and later for other publishers as well.\\"Margaret Armstrong Decorated Bindings Collection\\" She designed more than 270 book covers and book bindings, about half of which were for Scribner's. She worked in the Art Nouveau style and favored plant-related motifs, bold colors, gold stamping, and often slightly asymmetrical designs‚Äîan unusual combination that helped to distinguish her among her peers. Authors for whom she designed several covers include Frances Hodgson Burnett, Florence L. Barclay, George Washington Cable, Charles Dickens, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Robert Louis Stevenson, Henry van Dyke, and Myrtle Reed. She has been called \\"the most productive and accomplished American book designer of the 1890s and early 1900s\\", and her work is often compared to that of her contemporary Alice Cordelia Morse. Her monogram appears on many covers after 1895; it is a simple 'MA' in upper case with the 'M' slightly overlapping the 'A'. Armstrong cut back on book cover design around 1913 as dust jackets began to come into fashion and turned to writing her own books. (Her signature style was so successful, however, that publishers then hired artists specifically to imitate her look.) An avid naturalist, Armstrong's passion for natural forms reflected her interest in botany and in particular, in wildflowers. During the 1911-1914 period, she traveled and camped throughout the Western United States and Canada, becoming one of the first women to reach the bottom of the Grand Canyon. She discovered there several species of flowers that had not yet been identified by botanists. She details those and many other species in her Field Book of Western Wild Flowers (1915). With its 550 illustrations (48 of which were in color), her Field Book is considered the first comprehensive guide on the subject.Gullans, Charles, and John Espey.

Soon after its first flight in 1933 it set an international class speed record. Design and development The C.430 Rafale was a two-seat development of the single seat Caudron C.362, the winner of the 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe. Slightly larger and heavier, though with a lower wing loading, the Rafale was a low wing cantilever monoplane, wood framed and covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its one piece, single spar wing was strongly straight tapered to elliptical tips and was plywood covered with an outer layer of fabric. There were flaps inboard of the ailerons. Its fuselage was flat sided and fabric covered, with a deep, rounded decking running the full length. It had an air cooled inverted four cylinder inline Renault 4Pei Bengali engine in the nose, driving a two blade, two position variable pitch propeller. The Rafale's two seats were in tandem, one over the wing and the other behind the trailing edge, under a long (about a third of the fuselage length), narrow multi-framed canopy with a blunt, vertical windscreen and sliding access. Behind the canopy a long fairing continued its profile to the straight tapered, round tipped vertical tail, which included a balanced rudder that ended at the top of the fuselage. The tapered horizontal tail, with inset elevators, was mounted on the top of the fuselage largely ahead of the fin. Construction of the empennage was similar to that of the wing. The Rafale had a fixed tailskid undercarriage. Its wheels were on vertical legs from the wings and were largely enclosed within magnesium spats. The C.430 Rafale probably flew for the first time in the last week of March 1934, though the Flight article specifically refers to F-AMVB which alphabetically at least was the second of the type. Jean Precetti built a replica of the F-AMVB, flown by race pilot Helene Boucher, now exposed at Mus√©e de l'Air d'Angers. Operational history On 31 March 1934, only about a week after its first flight, the C.430 F-AMVB set a new International speed record of over for aircraft with an empty weight less than . H√©l√®ne Boucher, a prominent French pilot in the mid-1930s, died in a landing approach accident in F-AMVB on 30 November 1934. Though Caudron dominated the 1935 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe, the single seat C.430/1 Rafale, F-AMVA re-engined with a more powerful Renault 438, was outclassed by the single seat C.450 and C.460 machines and retired with engine problems after a few circuits.

Aschoff is known for her decorated papers. Her work in this field was greatly admired because it was mostly done by hand with materials such as oil-paint and water-colour mixed with paste. This form of craft and style stood out compared to the mainstream mechanically produced decorated papers of the 20th century.

Educated at the University of Nottingham, the Australasian College of Sport and Exercise Physicians in Melbourne and Queen Mary University of London, she worked variously for West Ham United, the Public Health Department, the Olympic Medical Institute, and the England women's football team. Carneiro was employed by Chelsea in 2009, leaving her position under controversial circumstances in September 2015. Early life Carneiro was born in Gibraltar to a Spanish father Antonio Carneiro, an electrician, and his English wife Lourdes. At the age of 16, she was inspired to be a doctor in sport. She studied medicine at the University of Nottingham, spent two years at the Australasian College of Sports Physicians in Melbourne and completed her MSc in Sport and Exercise at Queen Mary University of London. Career =Early career= Carneiro worked for West Ham United upon completing her thesis, after which she was employed by the Public Health department at Islington Primary Care Trust before being appointed to the UK Sports and Medicine Specialist training programme with the Olympic Medical Institute preparing British athletes for the 2008 Olympic Games. She also worked with the England women's football team. =2009‚Äì2015: Chelsea= Carneiro joined Chelsea in 2009 and in 2011 she was appointed by manager Andr√© Villas-Boas to work with the first team having previously worked with their reserve team squad. After his dismissal she continued to work for Chelsea under the managerships of Roberto Di Matteo, Rafael Ben√≠tez and Jos√© Mourinho. In the 2014‚Äì15 season, Carneiro was reported to have been subjected to sexist chants by Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United supporters. The Football Association's Heather Rabbatts, from their Inclusion and Advisory Board, called on supporters to report sexism within the game with the FA vowing to act against sexist chanting. Chelsea called for an end to sexist chanting by fans. Prompted by the abuse aimed at Carneiro, UK Sports Minister, Helen Grant, demanded that sport do more to eradicate ‚Äúthe scourge of bigotry and discrimination‚Äù. Journalist Alex Clark of The Guardian quoted the abuse aimed at Carneiro as a reason to eradicate sexism from both within football and society in general. She was part of the backup team supporting the Chelsea side that won the Premier League and League Cup in 2015. Carneiro and chief physiotherapist Jon Fearn were the subject of criticism from Mourinho after the first game of the 2015‚Äì16 season: Chelsea were playing Swansea City at Stamford Bridge. According to Mourinho, she and Fearn rushed onto the pitch to attend to Eden Hazard when he felt the injury was not of a serious nature. He was further annoyed because this meant that Chelsea, having already had a player sent-off during the match, were temporarily left with eight outfield players. Under the Laws of the Game, medical staff are not allowed onto the field without the referee's permission, but have a duty to tend to an injured player when summoned. Carneiro and Fearn were twice summoned onto the field by referee Michael Oliver. Carneiro's view that she was simply doing her job has been fully supported by FIFA and its medical chairman Michel D‚ÄôHooghe. Both Fearn and Carneiro were absent for Chelsea's following game, away to Manchester City on 16 August. Back in 2007 Mourinho admitted that he called match referee Mike Riley filho da puta, which is an abusive Portuguese expression which translates as \\"son of a bitch/whore\\". After the Carneiro incident, it was alleged that Mourinho had called her filha da puta, which translates as \\"daughter of a bitch/whore\\". Mourinho denied using the feminine form of the phrase, saying \\"Filho da puta is a phrase I often use, all of the players know it. There is no sexist connotation in the use of the phrase - it is just like saying 'f*** off'.\\" On 22 September 2015 Carneiro left her position as first team doctor with Chelsea. On 30 September, after consulting a Portuguese language expert, the FA cleared Mourinho of making discriminatory comments towards Carneiro. Neither Mourinho nor Carneiro were called to give evidence to the FA. The report stated that the audio recording had been examined but did not contain the words which the expert concluded Mourinho had said. Campaign group Women in Football after consulting their own language expert, said they were \\"appalled\\" at the decision to clear Mourinho and that its language expert was certain Mourinho had used abusive language towards a woman, contrary to the verdict of the FA's expert. The decision to clear Mourinho also drew criticism from Football Association chairman, Greg Dyke, and Heather Rabbatts, the head of the FA's inclusion advisory board. In October 2015 lawyers acting on behalf of Carneiro served notice of a claim of constructive dismissal against Chelsea Football Club. In March 2016, Sam Wallace, the Telegraph's chief football writer, contrasted the speed with which Chelsea resolved issues with players and managers with the 'disgrace' of its seven-month delay over the proper treatment of Carneiro. Wallace said that the next manager must resolve the problem. Private negotiations took place in early 2016, with an employment tribunal scheduled for June 2016 and expected to last 10 days. The tribunal was the subject of many newspapers' front pages, and was settled on confidential terms on the second day of the hearing. Chelsea issued an unreserved apology for distress caused to Carneiro and her family, and said \\"We wish to place on record that in running onto the pitch Dr Carneiro was following both the rules of the game and fulfilling her responsibility to the players as a doctor, putting their safety first.\\" She also concluded the private case against Mourinho. Legal documents submitted to her employment tribunal revealed she had previously rejected an offer by the club of ¬£1.2 million to settle the claim. The documents also revealed that Carneiro refused to return to work unless she received a 40% increase in salary to ¬£400,000 per annum, a severance payment of one year's salary, participation in a bonus scheme ‚Äúto properly reward me for my contribution to the club‚Äôs success‚Äù; and a ‚Äúsubstantial payment‚Äù in compensation for distress. = 2016: Private practice = Carneiro operates a clinic in Harley Street specialising in sports medicine.

This building was joined via a loggia to the cathedral. The site was reconfigured in the mid 17th-century, during the reign of the Pope Alexander VII (1655-1667), when the bishop's palaze was razed, and this palace was enlarged and refurbished. Construction persisted for nearly a century. The loggia linking the former palace to the cathedral was built into an adjoining wing. The plans called for the entire three stories, already built on a slope, to be faced with white and black marble, as was completed for the first story (1718-1724) and for the Cathedral.

During this time, she was one of few women who was able to receive formal training in the arts. Although her most well known work was created in 1912 and exhibited in 1913, her career was disrupted by World War I, and thereafter consisted mostly of freelance illustration work. Early life Florence Howell Barkley was born Mary Florence Barkley in Maysville, Kentucky, on February 17, 1880 to Henry Clay Barkley, an Irish immigrant and hardware worker, and Isabella Imogene Howell. She and her seven siblings grew up in Maysville and all attended school. After the death of her parents in 1897, Barkley lived with her sister Helen, her brother Frank, her brother Harry, and his wife Lillie. Her brothers opened up a small shoe store, H.C. Barkley & Company, while she and her sister kept house. During this time, Barkley and her sister Helen began to create paintings of landscapes and floral arrangements in watercolor and pastel that they would submit to contests in the Mason County Fair. Barkley lived in Maysville with siblings until she was 20 years old. Education Frank Duveneck's class, Art Academy of Cincinnati, estimate 1890-1912 In 1900, at the age of 20, Barkley moved to Cincinnati to study art. She was educated at the Art Academy of Cincinnati, where she studied landscape painting. Barkley then attended the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, she was one of many women to be trained by Robert Henri. Henri aided in the development of female modernism as his students applied his modernist ideals across different media. Barkley flourished under his instruction, then creating some of her most famous works. She was friendly with several other notable female artists at the school, including Josephine Hopper and Henrietta Shore. Career Barkley moved to New York City to work for The World as an illustrator. She worked as an illustrator part-time and created landscape paintings in her free time. Florence Howell Barkley, Jerome Avenue Bridge, Armory Show of 1913 Barkley's most notable work is the landscape painting, \\"Jerome Avenue Bridge\\". This oil painting depicts the Macombs Dam Bridge, located in The Bronx, near her residence. Originally titled \\"Landscape over the City\\", this work, priced at $100, was exhibited in Gallery E of the Armory Show in 1913. It was shown near works of Arthur Bowen Davies, Walt Kuhn, and Joseph Stella. Barkley was one of fifty women whose work was exhibited at the show. At the beginning of her career, World War I broke out and she stopped painting and worked for the Red Cross.Wardle, Marian. American Women Modernists: The Legacy of Robert Henri, 1910-1945. Rutgers University Press, 2005. Barkley was employed after the war, in 1921, by New York's Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. She created illustrations for hundreds of articles. Her illustration style was modern with loose strokes and slightly abstracted figures. The Century Monthly stated that \\"the flaky style of Florence Howell Barkley is charming.\\" At this point in her career, Barkley worked almost entirely in black and white pen and ink. She lived in New York's 15th Ward with roommate Grace James, also an artist. In 1930, Barkley's widowed sister, Helen and niece Isabel moved to New York to live with Barkley. She supported Helen and Isabel, who took care of their apartment, through freelance illustration jobs. Death and legacy Barkley died in 1954 at the age of 74 in East Northfield, Massachusetts. Her work is included in the Museum of the City of New York. Her paintings are expressive, romantic, and showcase the introduction of female artwork into American modernism.

The three parts, referred to individually as South Pole‚ÄìQueen Maud Land Traverse I, II, and III (SPQMLT-1, -2, and -3), traveled a zigzag route across nearly 4200 km of the Antarctic Plateau in the austral summers of 1964‚Äì1965, 1965‚Äì1966, and 1967‚Äì1968. The participants included scientists from Belgium, Norway, and the United States. Their objectives included determining the thickness of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, the elevation and slope of its surface, the rate of ice accumulation, and the subglacial topography. Other objectives included measuring the density and temperature of the ice at depth, measuring the geomagnetic field and gravity, and obtaining snow samples and ice cores. Operations The traverse parties consisted of two to three traverse engineers and seven to eight scientists, who were affiliated with The Ohio State University, the University of Wisconsin, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Free University of Brussels, and the Norwegian Polar Institute. Three diesel-powered Tucker Sno-Cats, one of which was equipped with a drilling rig, provided locomotion. Fuel was hauled in large rolling rubber tires, and supplies were carried on several 1-ton and 2-ton sleds. Additional fuel and supplies were delivered en route by airdrops from LC-130 aircraft of the U.S. Navy's Operation Deep Freeze. Direction was maintained with solar and magnetic compasses. Two of the vehicles each carried several altimeters and a proton magnetometer, and traveled such that one led the other by 8 km. Every 8 km they paused for simultaneous readings of the altimeters and magnetometers; and for measurements of gravity, surface slope, and snow density, and for weather observations. The surface slope was measured by scanning the horizon with a theodolite and recording the azimuth and vertical angle of the highest and lowest points. Beginning with SPQMLT-2, the ice thickness was profiled en route with a new radio sounder. At the beginning and ending points, and approximately every 50 to 75 km in between, a station was set up for the following work: a vertical 40-m hole was bored into the ice, the density and temperature of the ice at various depths in the borehole were measured, the ice sheet was sounded seismically, the accumulation rate was studied in hand- excavated 2-m pits, the intensity and direction of the geomagnetic field were measured, snow samples and ice cores were collected and analyzed, and the geographic position (latitude and longitude) and a geographic azimuth were determined by celestial (solar) observations with a theodolite. =SPQMLT-1= SPQMLT-1 began on December 4, 1964, at Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station and, after traveling a zigzag route of 1530 km, ended on January 27, 1965, at the unoccupied Pole of Inaccessibility Station. The surface encountered varied from soft and smooth to hard and rough, with sastrugi over 1-m high. The sky was often clear or patched with light cirrus clouds. Solar halos were observed frequently, and whiteouts occurred several times. The average air temperature was ‚àí28 ¬∞C, with a maximum of ‚àíl8¬∞C on January 5 and a minimum of ‚àí45 ¬∞C on January 26. The greatest wind speed measured was 9 m/s, on December 29 and January 17. On January 8 two skuas were sighted. At Pole of Inaccessibility Station a snow-accumulation stake net was installed and the vehicles were secured. On February 1 personnel and cargo were airlifted to McMurdo Station. =SPQMLT-2= SPQMLT-2 began on December 15, 1965, at Pole of Inaccessibility Station (where SPQMLT-1 had ended the previous summer) and, after traveling a dogleg route of 1340 km, ended on January 29, 1966, at the newly constructed Plateau Station . At Pole of Inaccessibility Station a detailed map was drawn, the existing strain-rate and accumulation-stake networks were measured, and a 5-km accumulation stake line was installed. On January 4 a heavily crevassed zone at was encountered when a vehicle broke through a snow bridge and had to be retrieved. The main crevasses were several tens of meters wide, 5 to 7 km long, and oriented approximately east-west. The crevassed zone is above a major anomaly in the bedrock topography, an abrupt rise of over 1200 m over a horizontal distance of less than 9 km. Two similar crevassed zones were spotted by aerial reconnaissance at approximately and . After reaching Plateau Station, a strain network was installed, and all three vehicles were backloaded to McMurdo Station for reconditioning. =SPQMLT-3= SPQMLT-3 began on December 5, 1967, at Plateau Station (where SPQMLT-2 had ended nearly two years earlier) and, after traveling a dogleg route of 1326 km, ended on January 29, 1968, at geographic position . Aerial reconnaissance of the planned route showed no significant crevassing except near the end point. On December 14, at 320 km from Plateau Station, the traverse encountered a sled- mounted building, similar to the one at Pole of Inaccessibility Station, which was left by a Soviet traverse in March 1967. Cairns built of empty fuel drums were erected at the sites of resupply airdrops. The temperature ranged from ‚àí40 ¬∞C to ‚àí10 ¬∞C, and the wind rarely exceeded 18 km/hr. Severe whiteouts occurred during the final week of travel. Two pickup flights, on January 30 and 31, airlifted personnel, equipment, snow samples, and one Sno-Cat to McMurdo Station. Scientific Results =Surface Elevation and Slope= The elevation (above sea level) of the surface along the routes of SPQMLT-1 and SPQMLT-2, based on the altimeter measurements, averaged 2780 m and 3090 m, respectively. On SPQMLT-1 it ranged from 2628 m at the second turning point () to 3718 m at Pole of Inaccessibility Station. On SPQMLT-2 it decreased from there to 2512 m at the turning point (), from where it increased eastward (toward Plateau Station) at a gradient of 1 to 3 m/km. On SPQMLT-3 the elevation ranged from 3625 m at Plateau Station to 2210 m at the ending point (). From Plateau Station to the turning point, the surface sloped downward with an average gradient of -0.5 to -1 m/km, and became much more negative on the southwest leg of the traverse. Two pronounced valleys, about 50 m deep and 10 km wide, and several smaller valleys, were encountered near the end of the traverse. Based on the altimeter and slope measurements, the surface in the region of the traverse slopes downward to the west, toward the Weddell Sea, with a gradient of about -2 m/km. =Ice Thickness and Subglacial Topography= The elevation of the subglacial terrain, based on the seismic soundings, radio sounding (SPQMLT-2 and SPQMLT-3), and gravity measurements, ranged from nearly 1 km below sea level to more than 1 km above sea level. On SPQMLT-1 and SPQMLT-2 the thickness of the ice averaged 2740 m and 2770 m, respectively. =Accumulation Rate= The average rate of ice accumulation in the area of the traverse has been estimated at 3.7 g/cm2/yr with a method that involves profiling the radioactivity in the core samples and identifying layers that correspond to a 1955 atmospheric atomic test. This estimate is now considered to be more accurate than earlier estimates based on the pit studies. =Geomagnetism= The measurements of the intensity and direction of the geomagnetic field were added to the database (now maintained by the National Geophysical Data Center) upon which are based the 1970 and subsequent World Magnetic Charts, World Magnetic Models, and International Geomagnetic Reference Field. The measurements from SPQMLT-3 were compared to the (existing) 1965 World Magnetic Charts (corrected to 1968) and found to disagree on average by more than 1¬∞ in magnetic declination and magnetic inclination, and 500 nT in total intensity.

It was built alongside the Great Western Railway's Leamington station (which is still in operation) and provided a more convenient station in Leamington than the LNWR's original Milverton terminus. The original station was temporary, and made from wood, it was rebuilt as a permanent brick station in 1860. Leamington Spa Avenue provided passenger services towards Coventry, Rugby and Weedon via Daventry, but was closed in 1965 as a part of the Beeching cuts. The Coventry line was diverted into the former Great Western station and the branches towards Rugby and Weedon were closed. The site of the station was levelled in 1977 to make way for redevelopment. The site was originally covered by a garage, bus depot and public car park. In the late 2010s the site was cleared to make way for low rise residential housing and offices.

The author reflects the Passion of Jesus, based on the Four Evangelists, originally in 23 stanzas. The lyrics were written for an older melody, \\"Es sind doch selig alle, die im rechten Glauben wandeln\\" (Zahn No. 8303).Luke Dahn. BWV 402 at , 2017 The first and last stanzas have appeared in 11 hymnals. Catherine Winkworth translated it as \\"O man, thy grievous sin bemoan\\". The hymn has been used in Passion music and is known in Bach's setting as a chorale fantasia closing Part I of his St Matthew Passion.  Hymn  Sebald originally wrote a reflection of the Passion of Jesus based on the four gospels in 23 stanzas of 12 lines each. The original title begins \\"Der Passion au√ü den vier Evangelisten\\" (The Passion from the Four Evangelists). It reflects the Passion, narrating the stations of the cross and adding the context of Heilsbedeutung (meaning for salvation), beginning with man's sinful condition and ending with thanks. The first stanza opens addressing the listener \\"O Mensch\\" (O human being) and requesting him to remember and deplore his great sin (S√ºnde gro√ü). The following lines state that Jesus Christ left his Father's bosom, came to Earth (kam auf Erden), born of a virgin for us (f√ºr uns), wanting to become a mediator (Mittler). The second half of the stanza mentions that he gave life to the dead and removed all sickness (all Krankheit), until it became urgent that he was sacrificed for us, carrying the heavy load of our sins (unsrer S√ºnden schwere B√ºrd), long on the cross. The melody goes back to Matth√§us Greiter, around 1524, and appears in Strasbourg hymnals of 1525 and 1526 titled \\"Beati immaculati.Psalm 119\\". Current hymnals contain only the first and last stanzas.  Musical settings  Autograph score of BWV 622, O Mensch, bewein dein S√ºnde gro√ü The organ chorale prelude BWV 622 by Johann Sebastian Bach from the Orgelb√ºchlein has remained one of his most celebrated. In the second version of his St John Passion, Bach began the work with a chorale fantasia on the first stanza of the hymn, which he later modified to conclude Part I of his St Matthew Passion as movement 29. :Incipit in Bach's chorale fantasia Mauricio Kagel quoted the hymn in his oratorio Sankt-Bach-Passion telling Bach's life, composed for the tricentenary of Bach's birth in 1985.

Johnston was a self-taught painter; she was also an author, writing local and family history books and travel stories. Johnston spent most of her life in British Columbia, living in Salmon Arm from 1944 until her death in 1983. Major exhibitions of her work were held in 1988 and 2007. Biography Man in Canoe and Grizzly, 1960s. Oil on masonite. 46.0 x 60.6 cm Johnston was born Gladys Foster in Birch Hills, Saskatchewan in 1906. She showed promise as an artist at an early age. As a child on her family's dairy farm she would often draw the team of horses grazing outside her kitchen window. Her family encouraged her in developing these skills, alongside her studies in piano and writing. In 1925 she completed a brief painting course at the University of Saskatchewan. She married Ernest Johnston in 1926, with whom she had three sons. Johnston's painting may have been influenced by her husband. (Her husband also painted, and he had spent time learning from Charles Russell in Montana before his marriage.) However, her earliest works predate the marriage, and her color sense and style of paint application was very different from her husband's. Her earliest works are signed Gladys Foster. Gladys Johnston was very industrious as she homesteaded with her husband. There were many demands on her time as she raised her three sons, kept the household running, and helped with the trapping, log cabin construction and gardening. Her paintings were a part of how she supplemented the family income, along with writing and reading tea leaves. Her artworks were not lauded as special or rare pieces of fine art during this time. They were simply a part of her impetus to express herself in various ways, as well as another commodity with which she could support herself and her family.Ainslie & Cran, p. 14. The subject matter of Gladys Johnston's paintings deal with the local geography of the places she lived in and around British Columbia, adventure scenes (such as a man in a canoe encountering a bear, a man being thrown from a horse), nature and other homesteading scenes. She kept several scrapbooks and diaries. The scrapbooks were filled with sketches and pages torn from popular magazines. Her diaries included records of things seen while traveling and lists of chores. These are written in a straightforward, yet often poetic, fashion.Ainslie & Cran, pp. 14‚Äì15. Her vibrant use of colour is notable, as she made use of a full spectrum palette. The saturated hues are grounded by touches of black and nuanced neutrals. Purples are liberally used in skies and mountains. The sense of space is odd, subordinate to the narrative. Thin glazes sit next to thickly applied paintstrokes outlining figures. Johnston died in Salmon Arm, British Columbia in 1983.

It was perpetrated by irregular Turkish bands against the predominantly ethnic Greek town of Phocaea, modern Fo√ßa, in the east coast of the Aegean Sea. The massacre was part of a wider anti-Greek campaign of genocide launched by the Young Turk Ottoman authorities, which included boycott, intimidation, forced deportations and massive killings;Lieberman, 2013: pp. 79-80 and was one of the worst attacks during the summer of 1914.Bjornlund, 2013: p. 40 Background In 1914, the Ottoman Empire had just emerged from the disastrous Balkan Wars, in which it had lost most of its European territories, except for Eastern Thrace, to the Christian Balkan League.Bjornlund, 2013: p. 14 Several tens of thousands of Balkan Muslims were streaming into the Empire as refugees. At the same time tensions mounted with the Kingdom of Greece over possession of the islands of the northeastern Aegean, which Greece had captured during the wars. In February 1914, the Great Powers decided that Greece would keep most of them, a decision that the Ottoman government rejected. A Greco-Ottoman naval race was the result, with threats of war over the issue of the islands.Boubougiatzi, 2009: pp. 82‚Äì86 In this atmosphere, the Greek population of the Ottoman Empire became a target of the Young Turk Ottoman government, from a press campaign against them, limitations to the autonomy of their educational institutions, the imposition of military service, as well as various financial measures, culminating in a boycott of Greek-owned businesses.Boubougiatzi, 2009: pp. 76‚Äì100 The Young Turk leadership began implementing ethnic cleansing policies in the spring of 1914. The Greek communities of the Aegean region of Anatolia and Eastern Thrace were targeted, facing boycott, intimidation, attacks by irregulars and massacre.Lieberman, 2013: p. 79 Some communities had the opportunity to avoid death by converting to Islam.Bjornlund, 2013: p. 35 In the Aidin Vilayet, on the Aegean coast of Anatolia, a total of 8,000-10,000 armed irregulars (bashi-bazouks) were operating as part of this campaign. According to reports submitted by the Danish consul of nearby Smyrna, Alfred Van de Zee, these groups were financed and run by the Ottoman state.Bjornlund, 2013: p. 39 Massacre During early June 1914, Turkish irregular bands looted the villages south of Menemen, causing the Greek populations to flee. Greek refugees of the surrounding regions poured into nearby Phocaea (Eskifo√ßa and Yeni Fo√ßa) on June 11.Smith, 1998: p. 31 Phocaea, a coastal town north of Smyrna, comprised ca. 9,000 inhabitants and was predominantly populated by ethnic Greeks. On June 12, irregular bands launched their attack against Phocaea itself. The attack began during the night from three different sides and was well organized from the beginning. The armed groups broke into several dwellings and shot their inhabitants, irrespective of age and sex, while apart from the killings, several rapes also occurred.Boubougiatzi, 2009: p. 109 German ambassador Wangehheim and American ambassador Henry Morgenthau reported that about fifty people had been killed, while reports of Greek refugees from Phocaea raised the number to 100. The bodies of those massacred were thrown into wells and included priests, old men and children.Turks Slay 100 Greeks The New York Times, June 17, 1914. Dwellings and stores which were already abandoned by the panic-stricken population were systematically looted. The amount of the looted property was so extensive and widespread that even irregular groups who didn't participate in the massacre and the destruction took part in the share.Boubougiatzi, 2009: p. 110-111 The surviving civilian population ran to the harbor and tried to escape by boat. Due to the general disorder, some people were drowned while trying to swim in order to save themselves. Turkish irregulars showing their booty, while Phocaea is in flames, picture taken by archaeologist F√©lix Sartiaux On June 25, the Danish consul of Smyrna, Alfred Van de Zee, quoted an eyewitness of the destruction: Also, F√©lix Sartiaux and his excavation team witnessed the massacre.Emre Erol. The Ottoman Crisis in Western Anatolia: Turkey‚Äôs Belle Epoque and the Transition to a Modern Nation State, , I.B.Tauris, 2016. Sartiaux's documented testimony and photos are invaluable in describing the sequence of events before and during the massacre. The French archaeological mission took drastic measures to help the remaining population and managed to save hundreds of them. They hoisted French flags on their homes and provided shelter whenever possible while the irregular groups were still committing atrocities. According to French archaeologist and eyewitness, Charles Manciet, the Ottoman authorities sent regular troops to Phocaea to deal with the perpetrators, but these troops also participated in the destruction of the town. Manciet mentions that when they left their houses, he saw the most disgraceful acts ever imaginable.A Multidimensional Analysis of the Events in Eski Fo√ßa (Œ†Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒ¨ Œ¶œéŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒ±) on the period of Summer 1914-Emre Erol He also states that on 17 of June soldiers were sent from ƒ∞zmir to establish order but these soldiers ended up plundering the town and that the murder and plunder continued until the 18th of June. Manciet states that the atrocities he had witnessed were of an organized nature that aimed at circling Christian peasant populations of the region. He also eyewitness packed camels climbing the mountains through the roads connecting Eski Fo√ßa to outside while they were full with the plunder taken from the town.A Multidimensional Analysis of the Events in Eski Fo√ßa (Œ†Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒ¨ Œ¶œéŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒ±) on the period of Summer 1914 In addition, the German reporter, Harry Stuermer, who was the correspondent of K√∂lnische Zeitung newspaper and was usually sympathetic to Turkish authorities later saw the town's \\"smoking ruins\\". There were also cases in nearby Muslim butcher shops where the dismembered parts of the victims were in display with the label \\"Christian meat\\".Boubougiatzi, 2009: pp. 102 Also, Muslim residents of the town mention the massacre. They also stated that when the Greeks left, their houses were occupied by muhacirs (forced Muslim migrants). According to a local Muslim resident testimony, the local Muslims were happier with Greeks as their sharecroppers compared to having muhacirs and described the members of the chettes (irregular armed forces) as foreigners to the region and cursed them as \\"rats\\" who \\"looted, stole and burned down Greek property\\". According to another local testimony, \\"there was so much looting going on‚Ä¶ everybody took what was left from Greeks, food, carpets, furniture‚Ä¶\\". People who belonged to the local networks were radically different in their perception of the Greeks compared to the muhacirs who were alien to the local networks. The local communities favored the Greeks. Rescue The Ottoman authorities tried to cover up the incident. However, after two days a French steam tug boat arrived at Smyrna and spread the news about the massacre. The crew had observed a large number of people on the promontory and sent ca. 700 survivors to the nearby Greek island of Lesbos. The Greek authorities there rescued the remaining 5,000‚Äì6,000 inhabitants by sending boats to bring them to the island. According to Manciet, the massacre continued until 18 June, when there were no Greek inhabitants left and Phocaea was finally turned into a ghost town.Smith, 1998: p. 32 Aftermath Right before the massacre, the county reached a population of approximately 23,000 people most of whom were Ottoman Greeks, but after the forced migration and killing of the Ottoman Greeks due to the massacre the population of the entire county decreased down to 4,000. The events in Phocaea elicited sympathy for the victims in Europe, especially in France. The people of Marseille, which was founded by phocaeans circa 600 BC, raised a sum of 20,000 French francs to support the refugees.Boubougiatzi, 2009: pp.146-148 Similar activity was also carried out by Turkish irregular bands against several other settlements in western Anatolia, while on one occasion almost all inhabitants of the village of Serekieuy, near Menemen, were killed after local Greeks armed themselves for resistance.Bjornlund, 2013: p. 41 These attacks against the Ottoman Greeks were performed in manner similar to those undertaken at the time against the Armenian population in eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire.Lieberman, 2013: p. 80 During 1914, a total of ca. 154,000 ethnic Greek inhabitants living in the Ottoman Empire lost their homes. With the outbreak of World War I, the Ottoman policies against the Greek communities took a more violent and systematic form and affected a more extensive area, including also Pontus in northern Anatolia. These policies included confiscations of property, as well as the creation of forced labor battalions for all Greek males. Therefore, the Ottoman government deported many Ottoman Greeks to inner Anatolia.

Artillery Magazine featured Rodr√≠guez's artwork in 2015. Her work was described as \\"a language of scrapes, squiggles and large blemishes to express her perceptions of the environment.\\" Rodr√≠guez commented on the article to clear up some statements that were made regarding the landscapes of her work. Rodr√≠guez was one of the 2018 Anonymous Was A Woman Award recipients.  Inspirations  Abstract, gestural, and painterly, Rodr√≠guez's works are subjective meditations drawn from memory and experience. Rodr√≠guez cites her multicultural background as an important source of inspiration.\\"Roc√≠o Rodr√≠guez,\\" in 9 Women in Georgia: An Exhibition of Contemporary Art,(Washington, D.C.:Georgia Committee of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, 1996), pp. 48100 Years of Painting in Georgia, Alston & Bird, 1992, pp. 98. Several pieces of her work are inspired by this central overarching question: \\"what is the nature of a specific thing, if it can be represented in various ways, even in opposing ways?\\". This query has led to an examination of her own creative process by dissecting the image down to its most essential forms. Pedestals, boxes of color, and fragments of paint are stacked within her canvases and drawings as a way of offering up an image that elevates the parts of the whole, thus building via deconstruction. Rodriquez's artwork aims at creating visual tension.  Art  Rodr√≠guez's body of work, Neither Here nor There was made after a residency in Marfa, Texas. The work in this exhibit is the direct result of her response to the open desert. The colors, light, and her mood filters through uneven stacks of vibrant rectangular and square shapes that spill and overflow with color. Rodr√≠guez uses two elements: colors and lines. It offers two systems of denoting space and place; one is coloristic, ambiguous, the other is linear, harder edged, and provisionally clearer. Consisting of stacked sections to form blocks, each could be a mini-painting in its own right, their surfaces animated by a wild array of marks. Her palette is equally compelling as the glow of rose or gold- orange sweetens the grays, blacks, and whites. They are set against a rich ground of neutral shades that are subtly warmed and emit a low pervasive heat‚Äîarranged along the recessionals of an invisible one-point perspective diagram. In her 2015 exhibition at Kathryn Markel Fine Arts, \\"Neither Here nor There\\", several paintings and drawings were exhibited which included Wet Cluster. This work shows overlaid, complex brushwork that is scratched, squiggled, smeared, melting into each other, the brilliance of orange-gold, forced back by small tautly outlined rectangles of grey and black. But the brightness seeps through and around them, in a beautiful orchestration. It represents the tangible raw energy that makes her process memorable. In this painting, florid pyramids of vigorously scratched surfaces, which might be mistaken for a child's uncontrolled rigor, capture the environmental assault on her sensibility and elicit a visceral reaction to her application of paint. Rodriguez‚Äô seemingly reflexive marks combined with her flamboyant use of reds, yellows, mauves, greys, and black convey a palpable urgency and momentum. Here her uneven and fractured scores both confirm and deny order to great effect.

It was found to be the third most common (~3% of total) cause of amyloidosis in a set of more than 4,000 individuals studied at the Mayo Clinic; the first and second most common forms the disorder were AL amyloidosis and AA amyloidosis, respectively. Amyloidosis is a disorder in which the abnormal deposition of a protein in organs and/or tissues gradually leads to organ failure and/or tissue injury. Although more than 30 different proteins can cause amyloidosis, the disorder caused by LECT2 is distinctive in three ways. First, it has an unusually high incidence in certain ethnic populations. Second, it is a systemic form of amyloidosis (i.e. amyloid deposited in multiple organs), as opposed to a localized form (amyloid deposits limited to a single organ) but nonetheless injures the kidney without or rarely injuring the other organs in which it is deposited. Third, LECT2 amyloidosis is diagnosed almost exclusively in elderly individuals. Given its relatively recent discovery, exceptionally strong ethnic bias, limitation to causing kidney disease, and restriction to elderly individuals, LECT2 amyloidosis appears at present to be an under-recognized cause of chronic kidney disease particularly in the ethnic groups that exhibit a high incidence of the disorder.  Presentation  Most individuals diagnosed with LECT2 amyloidosis in the United States (88%) are of Mexican descent and reside in Southwest region of the United States (New Mexico, Arizona, far Western Texas). Other groups with higher incidence rates of the disorder include First Nation Peoples in Canada, Punjabis, South Asians, Sudanese, Native Americans, and Egyptians. In Egyptians, for example, LECT2 is second most common cause of renal amyloidosis, accounting for nearly 31% of all cases. LECT2 amyloidosis (ALECT2) is generally diagnosed in individuals between the ages 40 and 90, with a mean age of 67 years old. The disorder commonly presents with renal disease that in general is advanced or at an end stage. Associated signs and symptoms of their renal disease may include fatigue, dehydration, blood in urine, and/or other evidence for the presence of the nephrotic syndrome or renal failure. Further studies may find that these individuals have histological or other evidence of LECT2 amyloid deposition in the liver, lung, spleen, kidney, and/or adrenal glands but nonetheless they rarely show any symptoms or signs attributable to dysfunction in these organs. Unlike many other forms of systemic amyloidosis, LECT2 deposition has not been reported to be deposited in the myocardium or brain of affected individuals. Thus, LECT2 amyloidosis, while classified as a form of systemic amyloidosis, almost exclusively manifests clinically as renal amyloidosis. No familial link has been found in the disorder although there have been several cases described among siblings. Cause = Gene = The human LECT2 gene, LECT2, is located on the long, i.e, \\"q\\", arm of chromosome 5 at position q31.1 (notated as 5q31.1). This location is close to several immune modulating genes including interleukins 3, 5, and 9 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. LECT2 is conserved in zebrafish, chichen, rat, mouse, cow. dog, Rhesus monkey, and chimpanzee. Human LECT2 is composed of 4 exons, 3 introns, and ~8,000 base pairs. The gene has numerous single nucleotide variants as well as other variations, two of which (see Pathophysiology section) have been associated with human disease. Human LECT2 has several different transcriptional initiation sights and codes for a mRNA composed of 1,000 to 1,300 ribonucleotides. mRNA for LECT2 is highly expressed in liver tissue and expressed at far lower levels in a wide range of other tssues. =Protein = The LECT2 protein consists of 133\`amino acids Its structure is similar to that of the M23 family of metalloendopeptidases. Unlike this family of peptidases, however, LECT2 has not been found to possess enzymatic activity and does not appear to share any functions with M23 metalloendopeptidases. It is widely expressed in vascular tissues, smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, cerebral neurons, apical squamous epithelia, parathyroid tissues, the epithelial cells of sweat and sebaceous glands, Hassall bodies, and monocytes. The liver hepatocyte is considered to be the source of the LECT2 circulating in blood. However, its expression in these cells is extremely low or undetectable even though these cells express very high levels of LECT2 mRNA. This implies that hepatocytes secrete LECT2 almost immediately after they make it. Using very sensitive methods, LECT2 protein can also be detected at low levels in the endothelial cells of hepatic arteries and veins including central veins. Several cell types or tissues, e.g. osteoblasts, chondrocytes, cardiac tissue, gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells, and epithelial cells of some tissues normally do not express LECT2 but do so under a variety of disease conditions.  Pathophysiology  LECT2 as a hepatokine, a substance made and released into the circulation by liver hepatocyte cells that acts as a hormone or signaling agent to regulate the function of other cells. While the pathogenesis of LECT2 amyloidosis is unclear, the intact LECT2 protein may have a tendency to fold abnormally thereby forming non-soluble fibrils that are deposited in tissues. It has been suggested that individuals with the disease have an increase in LECT2 production and/or a decrease in LECT2 catabolism (i.e. breakdown) which may increase its tendency to deposit in tissues. On the other hand, there are genetic variations which appear to cause the deposition of LECT2 in tissues. Studies to date have failed to obtain evidence for LECT2 gene mutations in the disorder but most cases examined in the United States are associated with a particular homozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (i.e. SNP) in the LECT2 gene. This SNP occurs in exon 3 at codon 58 of the gene, contains a guanine rather than adenine nucleotide at this site, and consequently codes for the amino acid valine rather than isoleucine. Although not yet proven to occur in vivo, the Val58Ile variant of LECT2 may have a propensity to fold abnormally, form insoluble fibrils, and therefore deposits in tissues. The Val58Ile LECT2 variant is common in Hispanics and appears to be the cause of their high incidence of LECT2 amyloidosis. However, not all homozygous Hispanic carriers of the variant ever exhibit LECT2 amyloidosis. This suggests that another factor(s) besides the variant Val58Ile protein's structure is involved in its organ/tissue deposition. A second SNP which is also commonly found in Mexicans occurs at codon 172 of the LECT2 gene. This variant is homozygous for a G nucleotide at this codon position and is associated with an increased incidence of LECT2 amyloidosis. A reason for this association has not yet been proposed. It has been found repeatedly that the mere presence of LECT2 amyloid tissue deposits does not necessarily indicate the presence of LECT2 amyloidosis disease. For example, autopsy studies find that up to 3.1% of Hispanics have these deposits in their kidneys but no history of signs or symptoms that could be attributed to LECT2 amyloidosis. This finding suggests that the LECT2 amyloidosis and its ethnic bias reflect multiple poorly understood factors.  Diagnosis  LECT2 amyloidosis is diagnosed by a kidney biopsy which reveals two key findings: a) histological evidence of Congo red staining material deposited in the interstitial, mesangial, glomerular, and/or vascular areas of the kidney and b) the identification of these deposits as containing mainly LECT2 as identified by proteomics methodologies. Kidney biopsy shows the presence of LECT2-based amyloid predominantly in the renal cortex interstitium, glomeruli, and arterioles. LECT2 amyloidosis can be distinguished from AL amyloidosis, the most common form of amyloidosis (~85% of total cases), by testing their blood for the presence of high levels of a clonal immunoglobulin light chain. If the patient tests negative for this light chain, positive Congo Red staining of the kidney biopsy strongly suggests LECT2 amyloidosis.  Treatment  There has too little experience on the treatment of LECT2 amyloidosis to establish recommendations other than offering methods to support kidney function and dialysis. Nonetheless, it is important to accurately diagnose ALECT2-based amyloid disease in order to avoid treatment for other forms of amyloidosis. Prognosis ALECT2 Patient Survival Based on Creatine Levels' Based on studies conducted in the United States, the prognosis for individuals with ALECT2 is guarded, particularly because they are elderly and their kidney disease is usually well-advanced at the time of presentation. End-stage renal disease develops in 1 out of 3 patients and has a median renal survival of 62 months. A suggested prognostic tool is to track creatinine levels in ALECT2 patients. The attached Figure gives survival plotss for individuals with LECT2 renal amyloidosis and serum creatinine levels less than 2 mg/100 ml versus 2 mg/100 ml or greater than 2 mg/100 ml. The results show that afflicted individuals with lower creatinine levels have a ~four-fold higher survival rate.

Rosny - although it is possible that Rosny a√Æn√© was the principal contributor. It describes the fight that threatens humanity, in the beginning of its history, against a new form of intelligent non-organic life, the Xip√©huz, some sort of sentient crystals. It is both his first story set in prehistoric times, and his first science fiction story, although the term did not yet exist.  Plot  The narrative consists of two parts. First is a descriptive third-person description of encounters between nomadic tribes and the Xip√©huz, resulting in many deaths from mysterious weapons and powers. This is followed by meetings of the clans and tribes, ritual sacrifices, and assembly of an army which is defeated by the Xip√©huz. The second part is the memoir of a wise war chief who observes the Xip√©huz from afar, then carefully approaches them to find out their habits and vulnerabilities. Despite nearly being killed on several occasions, he discovers how individual Xip√©huz can be killed, and how to overwhelm them. He then describes a war of attrition where many thousands of warriors encircle the Xip√©huz and reduce their numbers, which have grown into the thousands, sacrificing many men to kill a greater number of the Xip√©huz. Finally the forest inhabited by the Xip√©huz is razed.  Analysis  Some contemporary commentators, inspired by later writings, describe the Xip√©huz as extraterrestrial lifeforms. However this is a later interpretation: it could equally be simply a form from another evolutionary line than organic life. The authors do not provide any additional information, merely noting the existence of this non-organic intelligence and its interaction with Neolithic humans. Furthermore, the appearance of a form of non-organic life on Earth (without the extraterrestrial implication) is equally addressed in another work of Rosny A√Æn√©: The Death of Earth. The text has sometimes been held as the first true science fiction story. \\"Before Rosny science fiction did not exist,\\" writes Jacques Van Herp, \\"There only existed a close literature: social science fiction... There was never an event or life- form contrary to what we could otherwise understand, for there was no real science fiction, only when an author \\"invented\\" a new science\\".J.H.

Murray is best known for her thin porcelain sculptures with fibreglass overlay and fine crackling effects, inspired by natural shapes such as shells, coils, and scrolls. She is known for her innovative approach to technique and in-depth knowledge of materials in ceramics. Her pieces have been used by the Canadian government as gifts to dignitaries such as George W Bush and Kofi Annan.  Education  Murray initially studied science at the University of Ottawa from 1975-77 before studying ceramics at Sheridan College, School of Craft and Design in 1979, and then at The Banff Centre's summer residency sessions. After graduation she established her own pottery studio in 1986 at Meech Lake. She was inducted into the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 2007.  Artistic Practice  Part of Murray‚Äôs artistic practice is the installation of her delicate work, sometimes suspended from the ceiling, other times balanced on shelves or arranged with displays on the ground. Murray achieves a unique crackling effect in many of her works through the shaping and drying process of her custom clay with fibreglass layered on the surface. She explores concepts of peace, connection, and understanding through sculptural form often in relation to the natural world.  Exhibitions  Murray has exhibited extensively in the Ottawa-Gatineau region at Ottawa City Hall, the Ottawa Art Gallery, the Ottawa School of Art, and Art-image et espace Odyss√©e in Gatineau. Murray has also exhibited internationally in the United States, China, Korea, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Paris.

Their mission was to present exceptional theater performance, and to provide theatrical training and education in an urban Indigenous performance practice. Spiderwoman theater was an early feminist theatre group that sprung out of the feminist movement in the 1970s. They questioned gender roles, cultural stereotypes, sexual and economic oppression. It was founded in 1976, the core of the group is formed by sisters Muriel Miguel, Gloria Miguel, and Lisa Mayo. It was the first Native American women's theater troupe and is named after the Spiderwoman deity from Hopi mythology. History Muriel Miguel developed a piece with Lois Weaver based on three stories of the Hopi goddess Spiderwoman teaching people how to weave. Miguel's sisters, Lisa Mayo and Gloria Miguel, joined the group. Spiderwoman Theater was founded in 1976 and the group premiered their first work, Women in Violence, at Washington Square Methodist Church. The play combined the actors' stories of violence, contrasting serious subject matter with slapstick and sexual humor. For the piece they created a simple lighting design and a backdrop made out of Native American quilts. They toured the play in the United States and Europe. At a theatre in Nancy, France, the women refused to sweep their performance space before their show. Hecklers gathered at the performance, upset that a male producer had to sweep the floor. Organizers of a later performance in Bologna, Italy cancelled it for fear of riots. Spiderwoman Theater debuted their second play, The Lysistrata Numbah!, in 1977. The production melded Aristophanes' Lysistrata with group members' stories. Schisms developed in the group that led to the theater dividing in two in 1981. The offshoot lesbian performance troupe Split Britches included Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin. Spiderwoman Theater continued on with the three sisters and shifted its focus to Native American issues that year with the play Sun, Moon and Feather. Spiderwoman Theater's Winnetou's Snake Oil Show from Wigwam City is a satire of the European and particularly German fascination with Native Americans. The play parodies the characters of dime-store novelist Karl May, New Ageism, and individuals who pretend to be Native American. The play includes a phony shaman workshop where white people are transformed into Indians for a weekend for $3000. According to the troupe, it was an act of resistance meant to reclaim their identity as real Native Americans.Spiderwoman Theatre (1999). ‚ÄúWinnetou‚Äôs snake oil show from Wigwam City‚Äù.

Additionally, Spiderwoman founder Muriel Miguel was the subject about a short documentary by Theatre Communications Group in a series about theatre companies about people of color.http://www.tcg.org/TheNext50Years/EDIInitiative/Legacy/News/MurielMiguelScreening.aspx In 1997, a repository for Spiderwoman Theater, the Native American Women Playwrights Archive (NAWPA), was created. It contains promotional and personal documents associated with the theater troupe and also holds a collection of manuscripts and related items pertaining to Native American women in theater.  Founders  Spiderwoman Theater was founded by sisters Muriel, Gloria Miguel and Lisa Mayo (born Elizabeth Miguel). They are of Kuna and Rappahannock ancestry and were born and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. The sisters' mother and maternal grandmother also grew up in Brooklyn, but their father, a Kuna Indian, was a born in the San Blas Islands near Panama. According to Muriel, their father struggled to provide for his family via conventional means, and so the family would perform dances and snake oil shows for money. The three sisters were embarrassed by these performances and decided they would rather associate with more professional types of theater as opposed to being \\"spectacles of clich√©.\\" Muriel Miguel is a founder of the Native American Theatre Ensemble at La MaMa. She is a choreographer, play writer, actor, educator, and Two-spirit woman. She gathered a diverse group of women including both of her sisters Gloria Miguel and Lisa Mayo, thus creating the Spiderwoman theater. She also taught theater at Bard College. In addition to Spiderwoman Theater, she was a founding member of Joseph Chaikin's Open Theater. Gloria Miguel studied drama at Oberlin College. She has worked extensively in television and theater with the Spiderwoman, she has toured throughout New Zealand, Australia and Europe. She was a drama consultant for the Minnesota Native American AIDS, she was also a drama teacher at the YMCA eastern district in Brooklyn. she is also the mother of Monique Mojica, another playwright and actress. Lisa Mayo (1924-2013) was trained as a mezzo- soprano at the New York School of Music. Mayo also studied dance and musical comedy. She has written and performed in more than 20 plays that were produced by The Spiderwoman Theater, and toured New Zealand, Europe, Australia, China, United States and throughout Canada. She has created two one-woman shows The Pause That Refreshes and My Sister Ate Dirt. Mayo contributed to the Minnesota Native American AIDS by teaching theater crafts to young people. She served on the Board of Directors of The American Indian Community House from 1998-2007.

Working primarily in oil paint and watercolor, her paintings are known to bridge ideas about formalist concerns, particularly luminosity with her explorations of nature, atmosphere and vistas. Beginning with figurative paintings in the 1960s and '70s, she moved on to bold, color drenched, landscapes and eventually abstractions that explore color spectrums. Her experimental assemblage paintings that incorporated objects began an inquiry into psychological content that she continued in a series of self-portraits and a long-running series of solitary female nudes and portraits. Osborne's later abstract paintings present a culmination of ideas‚Äîdistilling her study of luminosity, the landscape, and light.

Gowda studied painting at Ken School of Art, Bangalore, India (1979) pursued a postgraduate diploma at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, India (1982), and a MA in painting from the Royal College of Art in London in 1986. Trained as a painter Gowda expanded her practice into sculpture and installation employing a diversity of material like human hair, cow-dung, incense and kumkuma powder (a natural pigment most often available in brilliant red). She is known for her 'process-orientated' work, often inspired by the everyday labor experiences of marginalized people in India. Her work is associated with postminimalism drawing from ritualistic associations. Her early oils with pensive girls in nature were influenced by her mentor K. G. Subramanyan, and later ones by Nalini Malani towards a somewhat expressionistic direction depicting a middle class chaos and tensions underplayed by coarse eroticism. She is the recipient of the 2019 Maria Lassnig Prize. Early life Due to her father, she lived in both rural and urban areas. Her father documented folk music and collected folk objects. Gowda's art schooling began at Ken in Bangalore, a small college established by R. M. Hadapad. Later, she went to Baroda to study under Professor K. G. Subramanyan. Work Gowda moved into installation and sculpture in the 1990s in response to the changing political landscape in India. She had her first solo show at Iniva, London, entitled Therein and Besides in 2011. She was a finalist for the Hugo Boss Award in 2014. She creates apocalyptic landscapes using materials such as incense and kumkuma drawing a direct relationship between the labor practices of the incense industry and its treatment of women. Her works portrayed the condition of the women which is often defined by the load of their work, mental barriers and sexual violation.

It was built in the early 18th century as a Baptist chapel, but later adopted Unitarianism. The exterior was extensively renovated in the 19th century in an Italianate style. The chapel has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. Despite suffering significant persecution from their peers and the state, Baptists erected their first chapel in Taunton in 1670, on or near the current site. This was replaced in 1712 with the building that still stands today. During the 18th century, probably during the ministry of Joseph Jeffries, the chapel's form of worship became Unitarian, although this was forbidden by Parliament until 1813. The Presbyterians of Taunton merged with the Unitarian church in 1814, and later that century the chapel underwent significant renovation. In the early 21st century a range of structural and decorative restoration works were carried out on the building, which continues to serve the Taunton congregation, who meet for services twice a month at the chapel. History =Baptist Meeting House= After the English Reformation of the 16th century, an increasing number of people were unhappy with the control that the government and monarch had over the Church of England. This led to the formation of independent churches and schools by what are known as Dissenters. The worship of any faith other than Anglicanism was illegal, and those discovered taking part were arrested and even sentenced to death. Oliver Cromwell imposed a period of religious tolerance, but his death precipitated further persecution of Dissenters, principally through the Act of Uniformity 1549, which required the use of the Book of Common Prayer as the only legal form of worship in England. The South West of England in general, and Taunton specifically, had a significant Dissenter population. There was a Baptist community in the town by 1646, and despite continued persecution they erected their first Meeting House in Taunton, on Mary Street in 1670. The 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence was issued by Charles II in an attempt to introduce greater religious freedom, and within Somerset, 82 places applied for licences to meet and worship, 22 of them for Baptists. However, the Declaration was withdrawn at the urging of Parliament the following year. This led to further hostilities toward Dissenters, which were heightened after the failed Monmouth rebellion, in which a large number of Dissenters fought against the King's forces. After the Glorious Revolution removed James II, his successor William III introduced the Act of Toleration 1689, which specifically allowed nonconformist worship. By 1721, the Baptist community in Taunton had grown large, and reasonably affluent. They built a new chapel, funded entirely by the congregation, very near to the site of the original Meeting House. The pastor of the church at the time was Joseph Jeffries, and during his ministry the church transitioned from a Baptist church to Unitarianism. =Unitarian Chapel= In his history of Taunton, Joshua Toulmin suggested that the church adopted Unitarian worship in 1722. This form of worship remained outlawed, as the Act of Toleration did not extend to nontrinitarianism. Unitarianism believed in the \\"One God and Father of all\\", rather than the Trinity of God as three consubstantial persons. Writing a series on \\"Baptists in Taunton\\" for the Taunton Courier, H. J. Channon disagreed, placing the change in 1733. Both agreed that the zeal with which Jeffries preached helped to swell his congregation, although a history of the Baptist church in Wellington notes that Jeffries was obstructive regarding a Baptist church being built in that town. Toulmin himself served as the pastor of the chapel from 1764 until 1803, during which time he \\"experienced unremitted insult and misrepresentation.\\" At one time, an effigy was burned at his door, and it was said that Toulmin could have suffered the same fate, but for assistance from his friends. During Toulmin's ministry, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge occasionally preached at the chapel while staying at Coleridge Cottage in Nether Stowey. In a letter, Coleridge wrote, \\"I walked into Taunton (eleven miles) and back again, and performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin.\\" The Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813 legalised Unitarian worship. In 1814, a Calvinistic Baptist group was formed in Taunton, and the following year they built a church on Silver Street. In the same year, the Presbyterians in Taunton found themselves homeless; having previously met in chapels on Paul Street and then Tancred Street, the \\"ruinous condition\\" of their meeting house led them to abandon it, and they merged into the Unitarian congregation under the ministry of Henry Davies. Upon this merger, the congregation included \\"a few of the most influential inhabitants of the town\\", and the chapel was so full that \\"children had to sit on the stairs.\\" An organ was added to the chapel in 1826, and at the same time, the building renovated and \\"beautified\\" at a cost of ¬£600. The chapel was closed for a few months in 1881, when the building was renovated. At this time, the stucco frontage was added to the building, and a number of internal alterations were made. The building had formerly had two entrance doors, but these were replaced with one central doorway. The Unitarians provided a free school for poor children in Taunton, and were the first in the town to offer this service equally for girls and boys. In 1886, the Mary Street Memorial Schools were built next to the chapel, replacing a smaller school that had previously stood there. The schools, funded by John Collins Odgers were dedicated to the memory of Odgers late wife, and her father, William Arthur Jones, who had been a pastor of the Taunton chapel. The school was run under the care of the trustees of the Unitarian chapel until it was closed in 1933 during a reorganisation of education in Taunton. The school building was also used by the Unitarians for their Sunday school, and as a function hall for lectures and meetings. The building underwent a series of repairs and redecoration, carried out by the Steel Coleman Davis Partnership in the early 21st century. These included a significant structural repair, as the main supporting roof truss was badly damaged. The frontage was also upgraded to withstand the weathering effects of being north-facing, and the damage caused by being so close to the road. Services continue to be held at the Unitarian Chapel, and as of March 2015, are held twice a month, on the first and third Sundays of each month. Architecture The Unitarian Chapel retains much of its original interior, including square Corinthian columns, Oak galleries and a carved wooden pulpit. A large brass chandelier was donated to the chapel later in the 18th century by Nathaniel Webb, one the town's members of parliament. In 1881, the building's frontage was decorated with stucco to an Italianate style. Each floor is split by a number of Corinthian pilasters, and the doorway is framed by two pairs of similar identical pilasters, and topped by a triangular pediment. On the ground floor, there are four round-headed windows, while the first floor has five round-headed window bays, though the outer pairs are blocked. It was designated as a Grade II* listed building in 1952.

Her 2001 work M51 by Candlelight depicts the Whirlpool Galaxy and is included in the New Mexico History Museum's Pinhole Resource Collection. She created the image using an aluminum plate camera dotted with dozens of pinholes of varying sizes. A photograph that Bos took in Toulouse was used by graphic designer Jennifer Clark for her mural Timeless. Bos made pinhole cameras from old travel books for an exhibition at Toronto's Edward Day Gallery in 2011. R.M.

She is also remembered for her experimental videos in which she merged dance and video, becoming a pioneer in what is now known as screendance or videodanza (videodance). She also worked as a television producer and instructor of film, video, and television.  Life  Weiss was born in Mexico City in 1947 to a father of Alsatian descent and Mexican mother. She grew up, at a time, when television was rising as a dominating platform of mass communication. Her younger sister, Kitzia, recalled that Weiss had always been attracted to motion pictures as a child.Torres, Edna. 1997. El videoarte en M√©xico. BA thesis, Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico. Weiss attended the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM). Although her intended major was political science (which she would later change), Weiss enrolled in cinematography courses in the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematogr√°ficos (CUEC) at UNAM. As a student, she worked in broadcast television, specifically with Televisa and the state-owned Canal 13. Defying institutional policies, Weiss presented, for the first time in the history of UNAM, a thesis in the format of a videotape. Despite this, in 1975, Weiss graduated receiving her degree in mass communication and journalism. Thereafter, she began to produce works for public and commercial television. Later coining the term ‚Äúteleasta‚Äù to describe herself.Weiss, Pola. \\"La TV te ve,\\" Artes Visuales: Revista Trimestral del Museo de Arte Moderno, no.17 (Spring 1978): 19-20 It derived from a similar word ‚Äúcineasta‚Äù meaning filmmaker, but instead alluded to television. Similarly, scholars such as Dante Hern√°ndez Miranda agree that Weiss's playful and creative nature was evident through the continuous wordplay of her own name. For example, she used neologisms such as POLArizado, POLAca, POLAina, POLAr, POLAnco, POLAque, etc. Her works were largely influenced by the Fluxus movement which emphasized the process of creating art rather than the finished product. She was also influenced by the works of Nam June Paik and Shigeko Kubota. After a trip to New York, she came into contact with Nam June Paik and his wife Shigeko Kubota. Both were influential artists of the late 1960s that experimented with videography. Paik was a principal exponent of the Fluxus movement and pioneer of video art famously known for his experimentation with televised images. Kubota pioneered North American and European video sculpture and continuously embedded feminist discourse in her works. At this time, artists experimented with sound and image through technology for creative zeal because no platforms for the distribution and exhibition of this type of work existed. Therefore, Weiss sought to use television as a possible medium for artists to display their artwork. Weiss founded the arTV production company, in 1977, with the objective of providing a space that facilitated the creation of audiovisual productions. In an interview, Weiss stated that television served as the mother of video and could be conceived as a form of art. For this reason, she named her artistic productions ‚ÄúarTV‚Äù for their ability to engage in mass communication. In 1977, Weiss presented her first work Flor c√≥smica (Cosmic Flower), in the 9th Encuentro Internacional del Videoarte at the Museo Carrillo Gil in Mexico City. Additionally, this is the same year that, as a professor of UNAM, Weiss founds the first educational space for the production and research of video,Taller Experimental de Video, in the Facultad de Ciencias Pol√≠ticas at UNAM. From the time of her first release until her death in 1990, Weiss embarked on multiple projects and exhibitions throughout the United States, Venezuela, France, The Netherlands, Uruguay, Poland, Canada, Belgium, Brazil and Argentina. It is believed that after her father's death, Weiss fell under deep depression and committed suicide in front of her camera, in 1990.  Focus of videography  In the late 1970s, video as a medium of art in Mexico was relatively new. As Weiss began to experiment with videography, scholars agree she developed a kind of performance relationship with her camera. In a special issue of the magazine Artes Visuales, Weiss describes her conceptualization of video as a negotiation between its personal depictions and relationship to mass media and the public sphere. She used broadcast television as a frame that allowed her to access a large and diverse public that was not found in artistic institutions such as galleries and museums. However, Weiss carefully used television to the extent that it provided a platform in which she could exhibit her work but refrained from working under the uniform and commercial practices of television and cinema. Weiss attempted to redefine the uses of video and television through her productions to form a connection between an artist and their audience. She bridged media and real life to emphasize a relationship between media and art. Furthermore, she sought to use this bridge to reject the falsehoods of media portrayals and depict realities. In avoiding the unilateral conventions of television and media, she employed an interdisciplinary form of art in which she used a combination of intimate perspectives and emotions to convey her vision of ‚Äúthe Other‚Äù and evoke a subjective experience among viewers. Weiss used the formal structure of video and conceptual nature of television to engage viewers with art. She realized this by using projection- identifications; meaning that, she included and illustrated images using real- life to cause some sort of stimulus in the audience. As Weiss explained, her vision was to use video as a medium that reinvented communication through the media distinctly from how it was being done by television.Weiss, Pola. \\"El video como posibilidad contestataria de la comunicaci√≥n social.\\" Unpublished essay. Doc. 440, Fondo Pola Weiss, Centro de Documentaci√≥n Arkheia, MUAC, UNAM. Mainly, her works stemmed from feminist perspectives that she demonstrated through the presentation of body, identity, and emotions. Weiss employed a combination of documental and fictional styles in her videos. For example, Flor c√≥smica (Cosmic Flower) featured a changing kaleidoscope; in contrast, Santa Cruz Tepexpan can be seen as a documentary. Weiss used her body as a vessel to illustrate her lived realities in her world. She used psychedelic qualities, like optical illusions, to explore herself within her surroundings. Additionally, she utilized her body in a form of ‚Äúauto- representation.‚Äù Namely, she chooses how to view herself and how the audience internalizes her body. Author, Dante Hern√°ndez Miranda, in an interview about his book on Weiss, discusses that while Weiss performed dances, contortions, and other unusual movements, she, simultaneously, traversed different spaces to learn more about her identity.MAC MASTERS, M. ‚ÄúEl Videoasta Dante Hern√°ndez estudi√≥ la vida de Pola Weiss‚Äù. En: La Jornada. Edici√≥n Digital. M√©xico, 11 de junio de 2001. http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/06/11/05an1cul.html Ultimately, she redefined ‚Äúauto-representation‚Äù as being an in-depth process of understanding oneself by focusing on one‚Äôs interior.  Notable works  = Flor C√≥smica (1977) = This was the first video production Weiss created and exhibited in the 9th Encuentro Internacional del Videoarte at the Museo Carrillo Gil in Mexico City. The video is about five minutes long and presents a kind of kaleidoscope. It features black and white images that transform as music by Chick Corea plays in the background. The images open to yellow, violet, and pink lights leading to the formation of a flower. The tonalities turn towards yellow, red and blue hues and depict a combination of feminine, organic and notoriously sexual connotations. = Ciudad-Mujer-Ciudad (1978) = In this 18-minute video, Weiss creates a world utilizing chroma key, color saturations and psychedelic effects. The geometric configurations of strong colors give way to panoramic views of mountains, skies, and rivers and Mexican urban areas which are interspersed with the naked body of a woman, played by the actress Vivian Blackmore. The image of the woman dancing, to the melody or exclamations of the voice-over (by Weiss herself), dissolves as shots of Mexico City, its people, and surrounding pollution are shown. As the successive language of images and effects are presented, sounds of birds and laughter are heard in the background as well. The video also pans to the domes of a church, to the naked woman driving an imaginary car in the periphery, and to the dance of the woman which invades the \\"suffocating\\" space with her pubis. Weiss draws parallels between the city and the woman; in other words, the artificial and the natural. She uses the theme of water. The woman represents the earth and city that is thirsty because they have \\"cut\\" (tubed) their rivers and the only way the city has to create water is by crying. With this piece, Weiss conveys her social concerns and artistic interests. However, she does not invoke a formal ecological discourse, but rather a poetic one by employing narrative qualities typical of cinematography. Furthermore, the movements of the woman suggest freedom, sexuality in their nakedness, ease, enjoyment, and delight in physical exercise. Her silhouette of flesh tone contrasts with the extravagant and iridescent colors of the background (lemon yellow, green, light pink, and bluish). Through a seductive dance, the woman contorts her body through sinuous, erotic, and cathartic gestures. This video was presented in the exhibition Nuevas Tendencias at the Museo de Arte Moderno (MAM) in Mexico City and was scheduled to be televised. However, due to the frontal female nudity recorded, it is censored for commercial television and shocks the artistic community.Carrasco, Jorge. 2011. Pola Weiss: la cineasta olvidada. Etc√©tera, pol√≠tica y cultura en l√≠nea. http://www.etcetera.com.mx/2000/399/jcv399.html. = Somos mujeres (1978) = This work features images of indigenous women in the busy streets of Mexico City. Weiss references the kind of lifestyle the women lead amidst the noise and smog of the city. She employs saturated colors and psychedelic forms. Through sudden camera approaches, using the zoom component of her camera at full speed, she pans to different planes abruptly. It is noted that the images lack technique due to bad framing and the lack of a steady hand as Weiss did not use a tripod. Moreover, in one part of the video there is a text in dialect without a translation or description of its significance. In another scene, we see a woman throw things at Weiss' camera. She includes this to demonstrate her alternate vision for video and broadcast television. Weiss believed that by using different visual strategies a new role could be ascribed to the audience such that they become active participants.Aceves Sep√∫lveda, Gabriela. 2014. Mujeres que se visualizan: (En)gendering Regimes of Media and Visuality in Post-1968 Mexico. PhD dissertation, University of British Columbia. pp. 12-13. In this production, Weiss attacks gender, class, and racial structures found within urban spaces which marginalize women. She highlights a concern for the marginalization of indigenous women and the poverty surrounding their community within Mexico City. Like one scholar explains, her videos serve as an \\"archive\\" that depicts how everyday situations are placed on female bodies. = Autovideato (1979) = \\"Autovideoato\\" means video self-portrait. Therefore, Weiss makes this piece in the style of an autobiography where she shows a short visual essay. Weiss incorporates a nude, dancing, female body to mock Mexican media censors. At the time, the difference between pornography and eroticism was identified as whether a nude female body was shown moving or still. She also blends images of herself through chroma key and layering effects. In this production, Weiss includes a text that shows an incredibly emotional and intimate exchange between her father and her. She confides in her father about her life at the time and the new changes she is experiencing. Weiss writes that she believes she has found her calling in video art. Although she recognizes her father's hesitance and disapproval, she explains to him that she has had many triumphs and would like to share these with him. Furthermore, she states that she has found a new way of perceiving the world through video. = Mi Coraz√≥n (1986) = Many scholars, like Dante Miranda Hern√°ndez (author of a book on Weiss), agree that while it is difficult to name a single work as representative of Weiss' entire legacy, Mi Coraz√≥n is the most reflective of who Weiss was.Lasane Octavio (1994). \\"Pola Weiss: Primera dama del video independiente (primera parte).\\" Revista Visi√≥n. no. 2. M√©xico. In 1985, Mexico City suffers from a catastrophic earthquake devastating its people. In this ten-minute video, Weiss draws on the relationship between the body and the city again like she had done in Ciudad-Mujer-Ciudad and Somos Mujeres. As the video begins, the camera focuses on Weiss' mouth as she spells out mi co-ra-z√≥n. Aceves Sep√∫lveda, Gabriela. 2014. Mujeres que se visualizan: (En)gendering Regimes of Media and Visuality in Post-1968 Mexico. PhD dissertation, University of British Columbia. p. 400. She continues to say ‚Äúmi ojo es mi coraz√≥n\\" which means my eye is my heart. In doing so, she is reinstating her belief that seeing is equivalent to feeling. She, also, presents a new allegory between the real seismic movement and the internal convulsion within herself due to the loss of her baby. Beats of a living heart are heard and, simultaneously, she makes references to menstruation through a flower that drips blood. As she twists and dances, Weiss' figure acquires a greenish tint. Flashes of an electrocardiogram and crystalline tears are presented. Weiss makes an analogy between her pregnant figure and Gustav Klimt's painting, Esperanza I, of 1903. Weiss enters the hospital and the word fetus is written on a skull. Weiss illustrates an intersection between her personal imaginary and scenes of the earthquake in Mexico. Then the word Mexico emerges. A naked Weiss stretches and dances on a background of the ruined city. The fragments of another Klimt painting, Life and Death, of 1911 overlap. The specter of a skull with a scythe announces death. She positions herself in a V, face down, with a red and alive heart in the background that is beating.

Garc√≠a draws on interactivity and performance in her work, using the exhibition space as a platform to investigate the relationship between artwork, audience, and place. Garc√≠a transforms spaces into a sensory experiences by altering perception and creating situations of interaction, often using intermediaries (professional actors, amateurs, or people she meets by chance) to enhance critical thinking. By engaging with the binary of reality vs. fiction, visitors become implicated as protagonists either in the construction of a collective fiction or questioning of empirical constructions‚Äìsometimes knowingly, and sometimes not. Since 1999 Garc√≠a has created several artworks on the web.  Work  Dora Garc√≠a was born in Spain and studied in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. As a young artist she moved to Brussels where she lived for 16 years. She participated with the real time theatre in public space \\"The Beggar's Opera\\" in M√ºnster Sculpture Projects 2007, where the character Charles Filch made his first appearance in her work. She has always been interested in anti-heroic and marginal personas as a prototype to study the social status of the artist, and in narratives of resistance and counterculture. In this regard, Dora Garc√≠a has developed works on the DDR political police, the Stasi (\\"Rooms, Conversations\\", film, 24 ', 2006), on the charismatic figure of US stand up comedian Lenny Bruce (\\"Just because everything is different it does not mean that anything has changed, Lenny Bruce in Sydney\\", one-time performance, Sydney Biennale, 2008) or on the origins, rhizomatic associations and consequences of antipsychiatry (\\"Mad Marginal\\" book series since 2010, \\"The Deviant Majority\\", film, 34', 2010). In the last years, she has used classical TV formats to research Germany's most recent history (\\"Die Klau Mich Show\\", Documenta13, 2012), frequented Finnegans Wake reading groups (\\"The Joycean Society\\", film, 53', 2013), created meeting points for voice hearers (\\"The Hearing Voices Caf√©\\", since 2014) and researched the crossover between performance and psychoanalysis (\\"The Sinthome Score\\", 2013, and \\"Segunda Vez\\", 2017). She represented Spain at the 54th Venice Biennale in 2011, and presented her work in the next Biennale 2013 in the collateral events, and in the international exhibition of the Biennale 2015, curated by Okwui Ewenzor.  Biography  Garc√≠a was born in Valladolid, Spain and studied Fine Arts at the University of Salamanca, Spain, and the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam, Holland. She is represented by Michel Rein Gallery, Paris/Brussels, ProjecteSD Barcelona, galer√≠a Juana de Aizpuru, Madrid, and Ellen de Bruijne Projects, Amsterdam.

After his return to Svishtov, he also tried his hand at lithography, theater set design, home decoration and iconography, which included 73 icons for the Church of the Holy Trinity. He became the first modern-style history painter in Bulgaria, joining his father in promoting the Revival, and continued to do portraits. His best-known sitters included Tsvetan Radoslavov (his nephew), and .

She has conceived, written, produced and executed more than 250 performances, installations, environments and two big ‚Äúcontraespect√°culos‚Äù (anti-shows). She has presented performance art pieces through television broadcasts, which she called \\"social performances\\" involving the non-arts public. She also designs sets, costumes, and props for theatre, television, and cinema.  Education  She studied at Escuela Nacional de Pintura Y Escultura \\"La Esmeralda,\\" one of the two top art schools in Mexico, from 1968 to 1973.  Artwork and performance  In the 1970s, she began working as a conceptual artist, participating in the Groups (\\"Los Grupos\\") Movement in M√©xico City. She worked with the group NO GRUPO since its founding in 1979, until its dissolution six years later. SInce producing her first happening in 1971, she has researched non-traditional narratives. From 1977 to 1983, No Grupo staged several performances each year. In 1979, Bustamante spearheaded their extremely satirical Patente del Taco (1984). The piece primarily consisted of Bustamante‚Äôs application for and reception of a patent for the taco, an indigenous Mexican food. The taco and patent were photographed in erotic ways, with the food arranged vertically and decorated with slogans such as ‚ÄúAtr√©vase a cometer un acto er√≥tico c√≥mase un taco‚Äù (commit an erotic act: eat a taco). The images were then blown up to a cartoonish side to symbolize the inflated role of machismo in Mexican culture.McCaughan, Edward J. Art and Social Movements: Cultural Politics in Mexico and Aztaln. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2012. In 1983, with M√≥nica Mayer, she founded the first feminist art collective in Mexico, Polvo de Gallina Negra (Black Hen Powder). Bustamante and Mayer's work combined radical social criticism and humour, exemplified by the group‚Äôs name: ‚ÄúBlack Hen Powder ‚Äì to protect us from the patriarchal magic which makes women disappear.‚Äù For one performance, ¬°MADRES! (1984), Bustamante and Mayer became pregnant at the same time so they could experience the conditions of pregnancy in Mexico. One element of the performance was a television series on Canal 2 de Televisa Mexico called ‚ÄúMother for a Day,‚Äù in which Bustamante and Mayer ‚Äúimpregnated‚Äù famous men like anchorman Guillermo Ochoa (1987). A key discussion topic on the show was domestic life, with a focus on the massive amount of labor that goes into motherhood.Brooklyn Museum. Brooklyn Museum: Monica P.

He took his first degree at Leeds in 1960, then began to work for the degree of doctor of philosophy, but was distracted from that by interests in physics, maths, music, and philosophy, and in 1962 was appointed to his first academic post, at the University of Leicester. Career On his arrival at Leicester, his colleague Monica Jones described Nandy as \\"a coloured communist\\". In 1964, he was appointed as a lecturer, and from 1964 to 1967 chaired the Leicester Campaign for Racial Equality and also took part in sit-ins at the Admiral Nelson pub, which at that time had a colour bar. In 1966 and 1967, he was Director of the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination Summer Projects; he also joined the Information Panel of the National Committee for Commonwealth Immigrants and served as Secretary of Equal Rights. Nandy left his academic post in 1968 to found and run the Runnymede Trust, which he directed until 1973. He was also a member of the BBC's Immigrants Advisory Committee and of the Council of the Institute of Race Relations. After a brief break at Social and Community Planning Research, 1973-1974, he was recruited as a Special Consultant by the Home Office, to work on the Sex Discrimination Bill, before in 1976 helping to draft the Labour government‚Äôs Race Relations Bill. In 1975, Hugo Young described Nandy as a highly intelligent academic, administrator and politician. In 1976, he went to Manchester, where the Equal Opportunities Commission had been located, and remained its Deputy Director and chief policymaker for the next ten years, remaining until 1986. There, among other work, he was intimately involved in driving through the Government's policy on taxation (The Taxation of Husband and Wife, by pressing for the equalisation of the State Pension ages of men and women. He successfully briefed Liberal and Labour MPs and peers to redraft the Government's proposed amendment to the Equal Pay Act 1970. In 1979, Nandy began to forge a link with the Directorate-General V of the European Commission, and organised a representative conference on outstanding issues in the progress towards equal treatment of women throughout the nine members of the European Economic Community as at 1981, and acted as the Conference Secretary. Nandy always had a detailed personal interest in broadcasting as 'the way a society talks to itself', and he served as the Chairman of the BBC's Immigrant Programme, 1983-1988, and as a member of its General Council, 1983-1990. He was appointed a member of Lord Annan‚Äòs Committee of Inquiry into the Future of Broadcasting, 1974‚Äì77, which created Channel 4 instead of the widely expected ITV2, and successfully lobbied through the Committee's report for a unified Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Personal life In 1960, while still a student at Leeds, Nandy met Margaret Gracie, whom he dated until 1964, when they were married in Leeds.‚ÄúNANDY Dipak K and GRACIE Margaret‚Äù in Register of Marriages for Leeds, vol. 2C (1964), p. 654 They separated in 1971, and in 1972, in Lambeth, Nandy married secondly Ann Louise Byers,‚ÄúNANDY Dipak K and BYERS Ann L‚Äù in Register of Marriages for Lambeth, vol. 5D (1972), p. 248 a daughter of Lord Byers, Leader of the Liberals in the House of Lords.

Working with sculpture, video, photography and installation, and deriving from sociology, voyeurism and geographical and architectural location, her work gives her impression of a place, its people, and their experience. Early life and education Snelling was born in Oakland, California. She learned about alternative processes and contemporary artists while attending photography classes in Northern California, and began to experiment with photography. She took several years off to do conservation work with the California Conservation Corps and later attended the University of New Mexico, where she earned a BFA, working as a firefighter with the U.S. Forest Service to finance her education. Career After her graduation, Snelling worked primarily as a photographer and collage artist. She continued to experiment with photography, painting over images of everyday life and tearing negatives to create surreal images. Her collage photograph 1881 Chestnut Street, an elaborate 2-D representation of a New York brownstone created from snippets of 1940s-era LIFE magazines, inspired her first series of building-type sculptures. In 2005, she created El Mirador, a small scale sculpture of an adobe hotel with six windows. A DVD player behind the piece showed a montage of film clips, synced so that the characters appeared to be interacting with one another. The original El Mirador was twenty inches tall; Snelling subsequently made a six- and-a-half foot tall version of the piece (\\"Big El Mirador\\") to show at a solo exhibition in London and later at Sundance and the Oakland Underground Film Festival. In a review of El Mirador as it was exhibited during Art Basel in 2006, the Miami New Times wrote: \\"Snelling's voyeuristic work exudes a surreal vibe dripping with poignant haplessness. It plays with the viewer's desire to engage in the emotional mix of the strangers they are intruding upon, as if challenging one not to find seduction in people or things that are broken.\\" Snelling originally used found footage for her video work. In 2008, she created a large-scale installation, Woman on the Run, commissioned by Selfridges. She had previously used found footage for her video work; for Woman on the Run, she and her friends appeared as characters in the installation, and original footage was shot. Snelling and her co-producer, Idan Levin, collaborated on adding new elements to the installation each time it was shown. Woman on the Run traveled to five different museums in the US, following the debut in London. Snelling worked with Levin again in 2015 on The Stranger, a 4:42 minute film which explored belonging and identity. The film included two narrated poems, one in English and Spanish and the other in Hebrew and Arabic, with concurrent subtitles below. Snelling's 2013 work included Mystery Hour. It used large-scale posters and elaborate architectural models to create \\"archetypal worlds from middle- and lowbrow genre films\\" to \\"depict imaginary B movies whose premises are as facetious as they are seductively lurid.\\" ArtForum described Mystery Hour as \\"mesmerizing, sinister.\\" Her multi-media sculptural installation One Thousand Shacks (2016) conveyed the \\"precarious individual existence\\" of people living in extreme poverty. Composed of a 16-foot by 10 foot wall of small-scale shacks, photographs, wire, wood, and other materials were used in each shack to capture people \\"living the best they can in excruciating circumstances,\\" portraying her subjects \\"not as powerless victims, but rather as defiant and hopeful members of humanity.\\" A variation of One Thousand Shacks titled Tenement Rising was included in Snelling's Naked City solo show the gallery Krupic Kersting in Cologne, Germany in late 2016. Snelling has exhibited in international galleries, museums and institutions, including the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Palazzo Reale, Milan; Museum of Arts and Design, New York; Kunstmuseem Krefeld, Germany; El Museo de Arte de Banco de la Republica, Bogota; and the Stenersen Museet, Oslo. Her short films have screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, Circuito Off in Venice, Italy, and the Arquiteturas Film Festival Lisboa in Portugal, among other places.

Her body of work spans multiple media, including public sculpture, photography, drawing and audio. Deborah Stratman in FIC Valdivia, Chile 2017 Biography Stratman's work has been exhibited internationally at venues including the 2004 Whitney Biennial, Museum of Modern Art, the Centre Georges Pompidou, Hammer Museum, Witte de With, Walker Art Center, Yerba Buena Center, ICA London, MCA Chicago, Walker Art Center, Wexner Center for the Arts, Museum of the Moving Image NY, Robert Flaherty Film Seminar, Anthology Film Archives, Pacific Film Archives, Los Angeles Film Forum, San Francisco Cinemateque, REDCAT Los Angeles, Gene Siskel Film Center, Harvard Film Archives, Her work has screened extensively at Film Festivals such as Rotterdam Int‚Äôl Film Festival, Oberhausen Short Film Festival, Ann Arbor Film Festival, Images Festival, Toronto Int‚Äôl Film Festival, New York Film Festival, and the Sundance Film Festival, and many others. Deborah Stratman is currently an Associate Professor in the School of Art & Art History at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\\"UIC Faculty Directory\\" She earned her MFA from California Institute of the Arts (1995), and her BFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (1990).  Filmmaking  She credits Barbara Loden's Wanda,Interview with Aily Nash, \\"Volumes and Pressures\\", Brooklyn Rail, 2012 Jon Jost, Robert Nelson, Hollis Frampton, Jean Rouch, Straub-Huillet and Agn√®s Varda as key influences. Stratman's filmmaking style comes out of an experimental documentary tradition, though more recent films have incorporated staging and re-enactment. She typically directs, shoots, edits and designs the sound for each production. Her films, rather than telling stories, pose a series of problems ‚Äì and through their at times ambiguous nature, allow for a complicated reading of the questions being asked. Much of her work points to the relationships between physical environments and the very human struggles for power and control that are played out on the land. Most recently, they have questioned elemental historical narratives about faith, freedom, sonic subterfuge, expansionism and the paranormal. Other projects Stratman has completed a number of installations, public sculptures, and other projects, including collaborations with Steven Badgett. Her installation, \\"Tactical Uses of a Belief in the Unseen\\" (2010) was an Artforum Critic's Pick. The installation \\"draws on urban crowd control strategies that were used by the Central Intelligence Agency's Audio Harassment Division during the Vietnam War.\\" Her work \\"Ball and Horns (aka Desert Resonator and Range Trumpet)\\", (2011 ‚Äì ongoing) in collaboration with Steven Badgett, is permanently installed at the Center for Land Use Interpretation's Desert Research Station in Hinkley, California. While for \\"FEAR (Decade)\\" (2004‚Äì2014) Stratman set up a toll-free phone number where she invited the public to share what they were most afraid of. The responses were recorded, edited, and compiled onto an audio CD and broadcast over the radio on WLUW (88.7 fm). The FEAR hotline closed in 2014. In 2014 she participated in Chicago Film Archives' CFA Media Mixer project with Olivia Block. Together they created the 5-minute film, Second Sighted, utilizing solely films from CFA's collections. Stratman has screen credits for her camera work on Thom Andersen's films Los Angeles Plays Itself (2003) and Get Out of the Car (2010). Awards Stratman's multi-disciplined art practice has been recognized and supported by a number of prestigious granting organizations and awards. She has received the Herb Alpert Award in the Arts (2014), Creative Capital Award (2012), Guggenheim Fellowship (2003), Fulbright Fellowship (1995‚Äì96).

The mixtape was entirely produced by members of 808 Mafia, particularly Southside and hosted by Future. Background In 2014, DJ Esco was sentenced to jail for 56 days for possessing 15 grams of marijuana in Dubai where he traveled to perform with Future at the 2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Esco was arrested then taken to the police station where there is no English being spoken, Esco quotes, \\"There's no judge, no jury. They assign you to a prosecutor and the prosecutor can just do what he wants.\\" Being an American, Esco still has the mindset that he is going to get up the next day and be bailed out, but he claims it doesn't work like that in Abu Dhabi so they tell him, \\"Grab some extra clothes because you're gonna be here for a couple of days\\". He gets in and is the only American out of everyone in the jail with all types of people from Pakistanis, Saudis, Afghans, Kuwaitis and Iranians all the way to some Africans like Somalis, Nigerian, and Egyptians. Esco spends 56 nights in the jail learning the cultures and languages of the different people in there becoming closer with some of the inmates and even the warden by the end of his time there. The warden ultimately took a liking toward him teaching him some things about Islam which helped their relationship grow in the end helping Esco get out of jail.

From Braddock, Pennsylvania, Frazier began photographing her family and hometown at the age of 16, revising the social documentary traditional of Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange to imagine documentation from within and by the community, and collaboration between the photographer and her subjects. Inspired by Gordon Parks, who promoted the camera as a weapon for social justice, Frazier uses her tight focus to make apparent the impact of systemic problems, from racism to deindustrialization to environmental degradation, on individual bodies, relationships and spaces. In her work, she is concerned with bringing to light these problems, which she describes as global issues. Speaking to The New York Times about her position, Frazier said: \\"We need longer sustained stories that reflect and tell us where the prejudices and blind spots are and continue to be in this culture and society.... This is a race and class issue that is affecting everyone. It is not a black problem, it is an American problem, it is a global problem. Braddock is everywhere.\\" Frazier has been extensively educated in photography through education at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania (BFA), Syracuse University (MFA), the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program, and she was the Guna S. Mundheim Fellow for Visual Arts at the American Academy in Berlin. Career Frazier reports drawing and painting from a young age, and credits her Grandma Ruby's with setting high expectations for her achievements. Entering college at 17, Frazier studied photography under Kathe Kowalski, who became an important mentor, introducing her to feminist theory, semiotics and the political uses, good and bad, of photography. Frazier graduated in 2004 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Photography and Graphic Design from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, and in 2007 received a Masters of Fine Art Photography from the School of Visual Performing Arts at Syracuse University. After participating in the 2010‚Äì11 Whitney Independent Study Program, she began teaching at Yale University. Since 2009, she has been included in a range of major group exhibitions, including the New Museum's The Generational Triennial: Younger Than Jesus, MoMA PS1's \\"Greater New York: 2010, the 2011 Incheon Women Artists' Biennale Terra Incognita, and the 2012 Whitney Biennial. Her solo museum exhibition, A Haunted Capital, opened at the Brooklyn Museum in 2013. Additionally, she was part of the 2009-2010 cohort of artists who participated in Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's Workspace residency program.LMCC, LMCC Alumni Update, November 18, 2018. Retrieved May 7, 2019 In 2014, Frazier published her first book, The Notion of Family, which received the International Center for Photography Infinity Award. Awards Frazier is the recipient of many awards, including: Art Matters (2010), Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award (2011), the Theo Westenberger Award of the Creative Capital Foundation (2012), and the Gwendolyn Knight & Jacob Lawrence Prize from the Seattle Art Museum (2013). In 2014, Frazier was named a Guggenheim Fellow in Creative Arts. The following year, she became a TED2015 Fellow and her monograph, The Notion of Family, published by Aperture in 2014, was awarded the 2015 Infinity Award for Best Publication by the International Center of Photography (ICP). In 2015 Frazier was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, to which she responded that the award was \\"validation to my work being a testimony and a fight for social justice and cultural change.\\" In 2018, Frazier was announced as one of Sundance Institute's Art of Nonfiction Fellows.Sundance Institute Blog, Sundance Institute Names 2018 Art of Nonfiction Fellows and Grantees, October 23, 2018. Retrieved May 7, 2019. In 2020, Frazier was named the inaugural recipient of the Gordon Parks Foundation/Steidl Book Prize.  Work  The photographic work of LaToya Ruby Frazier includes both images of personal spaces, intensely private moments and the story of racial and economic injustice in America. Her work includes raw portraits of friends and family members in intimate moments and examples of social injustice. As Frazier explains, \\"the collaboration between my family and myself blurs the line between self-portraiture and social documentary\\" Often her work focuses on the plight of her home town of Braddock, Pennsylvania which became financially depressed after the collapse of the steel industry in the 1970‚Äì80s. With black and white photographs, Frazier highlights the beauty of Braddock and how this town has impacted her family's life along with other residents. Her still photographs have a raw sense of strength and vulnerability juxtaposed in an honest and personal way. Besides working on her most famous work Notion of Family, Frazier has worked with other contemporary issues such as the Flint water crisis. This particular project depicts and focuses on a young woman and her family living their everyday lives amongst the crucial water conditions within their lower class Flint community. She recently contributed photographs to a New York Times project, \\"Why America's Black Mothers and Babies are in a Life-or-Death Crisis\\". Informed by documentary practices from the turn of the last century, Frazier explores identities of place, race, and family in work that is a hybrid of self-portraiture and social narrative. Her primary subjects of these portraits are Frazier's Grandma Ruby (1925‚Äì2009), her mother (b. 1959), and the artist herself. The crumbling landscape of Braddock, Pennsylvania, a once- thriving steel town, forms the backdrop of her images, which make manifest both the environmental and infrastructural decay caused by postindustrial decline and the lives of those who continue‚Äîlargely by necessity‚Äîto live among it. As Frazier says, \\"I see myself as an artist and a citizen that's documenting and telling the story and building the archive of working-class families facing all this change that's happening, because it has to be documented.\\" Through her own family she has been able to recount the history of Braddock by way of the generations who experienced it. Her work begins dialogues about class structure, history, and social responsibility. A 2018 special issue of Atlantic Magazine featured aerial photography and an essay by Frazier documenting the impact of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. on the landscapes of Memphis, Chicago and Baltimore. Frazier's work was featured in the 2019 New York Times Magazine Money Issue for her photo essay on the people of Lordstown, Ohio, after the General Motors plant shut down.Latoya Frazier, Dan Kaufman \\"The End of the Line\\", The New York Times, May 1, 2019.

Originally developed in the 1980s by Robert Lee Constable and others, the system is now maintained by the PRL Project at Cornell University. The currently supported version, Nuprl 5, is also known as FDL (Formal Digital Library). Nuprl functions as an automated theorem proving system and can also be used to provide proof assistance.  Design  Nuprl uses a type system based on Martin-L√∂f intuitionistic type theory to model mathematical statements in a digital library. Mathematical theories can be constructed and analyzed with a variety of editors, including a graphical user interface, a web-based editor, and an Emacs mode. A variety of evaluators and inference engines can operate on the statements in the library. Translators also allow statements to be manipulated with Java and OCaml programs. The overall system is controlled with a variant of ML. Nuprl 5's architecture is described as \\"distributed open architecture\\" and intended primarily to be used as a web service rather than as standalone software. Those interested in using the web service, or migrating theories from older versions of Nuprl, can contact the email address given on the Nuprl System web page.  History  Nuprl was first released in 1984, and was first described in detail in the book Implementing Mathematics with the Nuprl Proof Development System, published in 1986. Nuprl 2 was the first Unix version. Nuprl 3 provided machine proof for mathematical problems related to Girard's paradox and Higman's lemma. Nuprl 4, the first version developed for the World Wide Web, was used to verify cache coherency protocols and other computer systems. The current system architecture, implemented in Nuprl 5, was first proposed in a 2000 conference paper. A reference manual for Nuprl 5 was published in 2002. Nuprl has been the subject of many computer science publications, some as recent as 2014.  Successors  Both the JonPRL and RedPRL systems are also based on computational type theory.

Her diverse collection of fine and decorative art became the founding gift of the Spencer Museum of Art. Early life Thayer was born in Covington, Kentucky and was a great-grandniece of US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall. After attending women's college in the 1870s, she married in 1880, merging her considerable social capital with that of prominent Kansas City merchant William Bridges Thayer (1852-1907). He would shortly become a partner in the Emery, Bird, Thayer Dry Goods Company. Career Acquisitive and catholic in her tastes, Sallie Casey Thayer amassed a collection of more than 7,500 objects over her lifetime, including more than 6,000 rare books, original artworks by Winslow Homer and Robert Henri, hundreds of Japanese prints, thousands of glass objects from virtually every era, antique textiles from four continents, Victorian valentines, snuff bottles, folk samplers, and quilts. Her collection was a trove of objects of almost every description, brought together \\"to encourage the study of fine arts in the Middle West\\". By 1914, the collection had grown to fill her home, and Thayer began actively advocating for the establishment of a permanent public art institution in the city‚Äîa dream she would ultimately abandon. From 1914 to 1917, Thayer vocally criticized Kansas City's cultural environment, arguing that \\"although the city had come of age financially in the late 1800s, it had not addressed its need for libraries, educational facilities, and, most of all, museums.\\" She called the new Union Station \\"hideously ugly\\", and she once decried the lack of women on the Board of Parks Commissioners, \\"for the men, as a rule, haven't much culture nor any well developed ideas on the subject of color aesthetics\\". In 1917, with the Nelson-Atkins Museum yet to be built‚Äîalthough enjoying earlier momentum and available funds in the region to establish an art institution‚ÄîThayer donated her collection to the University of Kansas in Lawrence. There, it found a home in the Helen F. Spencer Museum of Art.

Synopsis  The film begins by showing similarities between the politics of the Swedish Social Democratic Party with prime minister Olof Palme, and the successful semi-amateur club IFK G√∂teborg where all players had regular jobs as cooks, plumbers and clerks besides being footballers. Just as the combination of market economy and welfare state (the Swedish model) challenged the free market economies of Europe, IFK G√∂teborg challenged the fully professional European top clubs. The Last Proletarians of Football then follow how IFK, playing in the second division from 1971 to 1976, get back to Allsvenskan in 1977 and transform into a European football powerhouse during the 1980s. Some of the players‚Äîsuch as Torbj√∂rn Nilsson, Ruben Svensson, Dan Corneliusson and Glenn Hys√©n, alongside manager Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson‚Äîalso appear and get to tell their view of that period. The highlight of the film shows the success in the 1981‚Äì82 UEFA Cup, which culminated in the 1982 UEFA Cup Final against Hamburger SV. The contrast between the Swedish amateur side and their well-paid opponents is repeated. HSV had just won the Bundesliga, and were so confident that even after losing 1‚Äì0 in the first match in Gothenburg, pennants proclaiming \\"Hamburger SV ‚Äì UEFA Cup Winners 1982\\" () had been produced, distributed and sold in Hamburg before the second game. The Last Proletarians of Football then show how IFK G√∂teborg went on to beat the German team 3‚Äì0 away, the first ever European trophy won by a Swedish club (and currently only one of two as IFK repeated their success in the 1986‚Äì87 UEFA Cup). J√∂nsson and Hjorth√©n show how Swedish society changes in the mid 1980s, diverging from the Swedish model. Ideals change, egoism is on the rise and solidarity is no longer inherent to Swedish society. They contend that the assassination of Olof Palme in February 1986 is the turning point. But IFK G√∂teborg, still an amateur team, marches on and reaches the semifinals in the 1985‚Äì86 European Cup. The matches against FC Barcelona in April 1986 are then pointed out as the turning point for IFK G√∂teborg, and their success as an amateur club. Images from the convincing 3‚Äì0 win at home in Gothenburg, is followed by speculation about bribed referees and foul play before the match in Barcelona. J√∂nsson and Hjorth√©n argue that the rich and powerful Spanish club could not afford to lose against a Swedish amateur side. FC Barcelona goes on to win 3‚Äì0, and a goalless extra time is followed by Barcelona winning 5‚Äì4 in the penalty shoot-out. Scenes of IFK G√∂teborg getting eliminated from European football then cut to the scenes of Olof Palme's funeral as the documentary ends.  Release  An extended 80-minute cut of the film was sneak-previewed at the Draken cinema in Gothenburg on 4 January 2011, and on 1 April the general release 74-minute version started screening. The Last Proletarians of Football was released on DVD on 27 May 2011, early DVDs shipped with a replica of the Hamburger SV pennant claiming they won the 1982 UEFA Cup. The documentary has been televised by Sveriges Television twice, a 59-minute cut later the release year on 4 September, and the full- length film on 20 June 2012. The Last Proletarians of Football has also been screened abroad, in Barcelona (at the OffsideFest football film festival), London, Berlin, Palermo (at the SportFilm Festival), Liverpool (at the Kicking + Screening football film festival), New York City, Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo and Bilbao.  Reception and awards  The Last Proletarians of Football was praised in Sweden as well as abroad, and received favorable reviews in all the major Swedish newspapers. The main criticism the film received was that it tried to force the connection between politics and football too hard, but the connection has also been pointed out as one of the strengths of the film. The film won the Paladino d'oro, the award for the best football film at the SportFilm Festival in Palermo and was nominated to two further categories, best film editing and best cinematography.

Work Phelps began showing her work in New York City in 1995 after earning her MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design. She is well known for her pencil drawings, which are typically scenes taken from her own life. Through meticulous documentation of her everyday events, she has created an extensive body of work that explores her financial pitfalls and successes, her sexuality, and mundane everyday tasks. Her work is also often saturated with financial references, citing the value of her work as well as her student debt and foreclosure preceding. Her mother is a mathematician, which may explain some of her proclivity towards numbers. Her creative documentation is so detailed that it includes time spent walking her dog, having sex, any income earned, and every expenditure she makes (drawn in red). Phelps traces each drawing sold and adds tracing information of the previous buyers and the price to each further generation of a piece. These tracings are mounted to wood with her well known red and green lines marking the economic history of the work. In 2012, Phelps gained notoriety for The Cost of Love, a 25-panel painting constructed from an 8-page court ruling after a failed attempt to win back her New York apartment from her ex-girlfriend. After three years of co-habitation with her partner and child, Phelp's ex refused to leave their shared apartment. Legal fees and the losing ownership over the property had cost the artist an estimated $350,000, which is referenced in the painting with 350,000 individual red stripes. She is currently represented by Galerie Judin in Berlin, Werner Klein in Cologne, Hubert Winter in Vienna, Michael Sturm in Stuttgart, Patrick Heide in London, Luis de Jesus in LA, and Oath Contemporary in Tulsa; she was formerly represented by Brennan & Griffin Gallery in New York City.

She was a Royal Mail Ship until 1914, when on the eve of the First World War the Admiralty requisitioned her as a hospital ship. In 1917 a German U-boat torpedoed Asturias but her crew managed to beach her. She was raised and towed into port and spent the next two years as an ammunition hulk. In 1922‚Äì23 RMSP had her repaired and re-fitted as the cruise ship Arcadian. She was laid up in 1930 and sold for scrap in 1933. Ocean liner Harland & Wolff in Belfast, Ireland, built Asturias for the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. She was a member of RMSP's \\"A\\"-class of passenger liners on the Southampton ‚Äì Buenos Aires route. Asturias was long Length between perpendiculars, had a beam of and depth of . Her tonnages were , and 8,156 tons under deck. She had two screws, each driven by a four-cylinder quadruple expansion steam engine. Between them the two engines developed a total of 924 NHP. Harland and Wolff launched her on 26 September 1907 and completed her on 8 January 1908. There was an Anglo-German arms race before the First World War, and in 1913 the Admiralty armed most of RMSP's \\"A\\"-class liners as defensively equipped merchant ships (\\"DAMS\\") . Asturias was armed with two QF guns. Hospital ship However, just before the First World War the Admiralty decided to use Asturias as a hospital ship instead. Her First Class smokeroom was converted into an operating theatre. Her dining room was converted into a ward for 85 patients. Cabin partitions were removed to create other wards. Her children's dining room was converted into bathrooms and toilets. Radiology and disinfecting facilities were installed. Her total capacity was for 896 patients. Asturias was painted in the hospital ship livery of a white hull with a broad green band punctuated by large red crosses. On 5 August 1914, one day after the UK entered the war, Asturias left Southampton for the Royal Navy anchorage at Scapa Flow. She was soon sent to Le Havre in northern France, where she embarked wounded troops from the British Expeditionary Force. Asturias duties took her mostly to French and Mediterranean ports, from Saint- Nazaire on the Bay of Biscay to the Gallipoli Campaign in Turkey. She also visited Salonika and Egypt. On one occasion carried 2,400 sick and wounded back to the UK: more than twice the number she had was equipped to carry. At 5:05 on 1 February 1915 a German U-boat fired a torpedo that struck Asturias but failed to detonate. A month later Germany released a press statement claiming that Asturias was misidentified and that once the U-boat crew realized their mistake it broke off the attack.< In the spring of 1916 HM King George V visited Asturias. Later that year J. R. R. Tolkien returned to the UK aboard her. On 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked Regina Trench in the Battle of the Somme, he had caught trench fever. Tolkien was invalided to England on 8 November 1916, and remembered there being salt water baths on board. =Sinking and salvage= Asturias as a hospital ship On 20 March 1917 Asturias disembarked 1,000 wounded men at Avonmouth. She then sailed for Southampton, but that night off Start Point, Devon the German U-boat torpedoed her. Her machine spaces quickly flooded and her Master ordered her crew and medical staff of 50 nurses to abandon ship. Because her engine room was flooded the controls to shut down her engines could not be reached. Therefore, she was still slowly under way when her crew launched her lifeboats, and some occupants of one boat were drowned. Asturias was down by her stern and listing to port, but as she was still under way she made for shore. Her Master managed to beach her near Bolt Head. There she lowered her remaining boats, in which her survivors made landfall at Salcombe. One source counted 31 persons killed, and another 12 missing. Another counts the total number of dead as 35. A month later Asturias was refloated and taken to Plymouth. There she was dry docked, and the damage was found to be so extensive that she was not repaired until after the end of the war. She was declared a total loss, the Admiralty bought her and used her as an ammunition hulk at Plymouth for the remainder of the war. Cruise ship Arcadian A painting by Kenneth Shoesmith of Arcadian and her sister ship in the 1920s on a cruise in a Norwegian fjord In 1920 RMSP bought the damaged hulk and had her towed to Belfast. Shipyards were busy building new tonnage to replace vessels lost in the war, so Asturias repairs and refit did not begin until 1922. RMSP had her converted into a cruise ship, which included turning some of her cargo holds into passenger accommodation, making her cabins more spacious and adding more public rooms. At the same time she was converted from coal to oil fuel. The work took a year, at the end of which RMPS renamed her Arcadian. Arcadian cruised the Mediterranean and West Indies from 1923 until October 1930, when she was laid up. In 1933 Amakasu Gomei Kasha of Japan bought her for ¬£13,700 for scrap.

It occupies the block bounded by Avenida Paulista, Rua Augusta, Alameda Santos and Rua Padre Jo√£o Manuel. The project was authored by architect David Libeskind and is characterized by being one of the first major modern multifunctional buildings deployed in the city of S√£o Paulo. The complex is characterized by the blending of different uses in the same urban structure: within the building are the following usages: residential, commercial, services and leisure. The relationship between the collective trade usages, leisure-and uses private residences-gives the composition between two parts: in the horizontal part, which occupies the entire block on which to deploy the building-is a shopping arcade, and the vertical part, which occupies only a part of the projection of the terrain are the apartments. The Gallery proposal in the National Assembly became an architectural paradigm for projects of similar buildings in the central area of S√£o Paulo during the 1950s decade. Conjunto Nacional has restaurants, offices and other types of shops and services, plus the largest bookstore in Latin America by built area, the Livraria Cultura. For many years it housed the Cine Astor and the Fasano Restaurant. In 2005, the building was listed by Condephaat, the State Council of Defense of historical and architectural heritage.  History  The building began construction in 1952, after the decision of the Argentine Jewish businessman Jos√© Tjurs to build a large building on Avenida Paulista - which until then had largely residential character. His intention was to bring together in one building a hotel and a shopping center. In the late 50s, as the city did not allow the hotel construction at the site, some modifications to the original design of David Libeskind were implemented.  Clock  The clock of the National Assembly mark the time and the temperature of the city of S√£o Paulo.

Early life  Yaldwyn was born at Blackdown House in Lodsworth, Sussex, England on 6 September 1801 to Richard Yaldwyn and his wife Martha (n√©e Serle) and was privately educated on the family estate. In 1831 he had married Henrietta Mary Bowles in Cuckfield, Sussex. They were to have three children including William Yaldwyn Jr., who also went on to be appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council. Yaldwyn travelled to Australia on 5 May 1836 from Gravesend to Sydney on the \\"William Glen Anderson\\". His wife Henrietta, their two children William (Willy) and Henrietta (Dally) with Caroline Bowles his sister-in-law accompanied him. After a short stay in Sydney the family travelled to Yass where Yaldwyn purchased of land freehold from the New South Wales Government. William and Henrietta had their third child in Yass called Burton born on 19 September 1837. Yaldwyn sent trusted friend John Coppock (1795-1865) to Port Phillip to source a station there and in about September 1838 the Yaldwyn family occupied the station called \\"Barfold\\" near Kyneton. The stay at \\"Barfold\\" was brief and in 1839 they sold \\"Barfold\\" and moved to Melbourne. Yaldwyn was included on the first roll of magistrates by Captain William Lonsdale. Yaldwyn was one of the first subscribers to the Melbourne Club and ran two horses at the first race meeting at Flemington Racecourse as well as attending as a steward. He purchased several blocks of land at Brunswick, Prahran, Kal Kallo and Collins Street. Property values fell rapidly and William Yaldwyn was forced to sell.

D. Estilette (December 19, 1833 - November 7, 1919), was a lawyer and state district court judge from Opelousas, Louisiana, who from 1872 to 1877 was a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives during the era of Reconstruction. In 1876, he was the House Speaker, sandwiched in between the terms of the Republican Michael Hahn of St. Charles Parish in suburban New Orleans. Biographical sketch A native of St. Landry Parish in South Louisiana, Estilette attended the former St. Charles College in Grand Coteau. In 1857, Estilette received a Bachelor of Arts degree in classical studies from Yale University. While in New Haven, Connecticut, he married the former Fannie Thompson Bacon (1834-1897), whom he outlived by more than twenty years. The couple had one child, Julia B. Estinette Dupr√© (1860-1944). Estilette's sister-in-law married a Yale professor, Eugene L. Richards.Henry E. Chambers, A History of Louisiana, Vo. 2 (Chicago and New York City: American Historical Society, Inc., 1925), pp. 378-379 After returning to St. Landry Parish from Yale, Estilette engaged briefly in school teaching and was the editor of an independent newspaper The Opelousas Patriot. The publication was razed in the spring of 1863 in an invasion of U.S. Army troops during the American Civil War. Estilette then turned solely to his law practice and was appointed and then elected district attorney of the 8th Judicial District, which then encompassed St. Landry as well as Calcasieu, Lafayette, and Vermilion parishes in southwestern Louisiana. He was the state House Speaker under terms of the Wheeler Compromise. A decade after his legislative service ended, Estilette was appointed Judge of the 13th Judicial District, which consistes of St. Landry and Acadia parishes. In 1888, he resumed his legal practice. Over the years he was associated in the practice of law with not only his son-in-law but also Judge John E. King. Judge Estilette is interred with other family members, including the Dupr√©s, at Myrtle Grove Cemetery in Opelousas.

She has organized around the issues of health, student services and rights, rights for domestic workers, ending police brutality, anti-racism, and violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people of color. Her editorial writing has been published by The Guardian, The Nation, Rolling Stone, and Truthout. She currently directs Special Projects at the National Domestic Workers Alliance and is the Principal at the Black Futures Lab. Early life and education Garza was born in Oakland, California, on January 4, 1981. She grew up as Alicia Schwartz in Marin County in a mixed-raced and mixed-religion household, with an African-American mother and a Jewish stepfather. Garza identifies as Jewish. The family ran an antiques business, assisted later by her younger brother, Joey. In her teens, Alicia engaged in activism, promoting school sex education about birth control. Enrolling in the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), she continued her activism by joining the student association and calling for higher pay for the university's janitors. In her final year at college, she helped organize the first Women of Color Conference, a university-wide convocation held at UCSD in 2002. She graduated in 2002 with a degree in anthropology and sociology. In 2003 she met Malachi Garza, 24, a transgender man and a community activist. In 2004, Alicia came out as queer to her family. In 2008, she married Malachi and took the name Garza, settling in Oakland.  Career  =Black Lives Matter= With Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors, Garza birthed the Black Lives Matter hashtag. Garza is credited with inspiring the slogan when, after the July 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman of murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, she posted on Facebook: \\"I continue to be surprised at how little Black lives matter... Our lives matter.\\" Cullors shared this with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. She was also struck by the similarities of Trayvon Martin to her younger brother, Joey, feeling that Joey could have been killed instead. The organization Black Lives Matter was spurred on by the killings of black people by police in recent media and racial disparities within the U.S. criminal legal system. Concerns were over violence from the police, mass incarceration, police militarization, and over-criminalization. In particular, the movement was born and Garza's post became popularized after protests emerged in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was shot and killed by a white police officer. Garza led the 2015 Freedom Ride to Ferguson, organized by Cullors and Darnell Moore that launched the building of BlackLivesMatter chapters across the United States and the world. However, Garza does not think of the Black Lives Matter Movement as ever being created. She feels her work is only a continuation of the resistance led by black people in America. The movement and Garza are credited for popularizing the use of social media for mass mobilization in the United States; a practice called ‚Äúmediated mobilization‚Äù. This practice has been used by other movements such as the #MeToo movement. = The Movement for Black Lives = The Movement for Black Lives was created following concerns over the way that Black Lives Matter had become synonymous with the Ferguson riots. The Movement for Black Lives is the largest group inside the Black Lives Matter movement's network. This group directs their activism based on Garza's advocacy style, which works outside of the existing power structure as a way to avoid what they see as the organizational failures of past black activist groups. They reject traditional tactics and avoid making connections and compromises with politicians. The group also puts those with the most marginalized identities in leadership positions. In 2015, The Movement for Black Lives created the Policy Table in an attempt to translate their goals into a policy platform. This involved initiatives that give bail money to black mothers who could not afford it and a land-rights initiative. = Book = Garza's first book, The Purpose of Power: How We Come Together When We Fall Apart, will be published in October 2020 by Penguin Random House. Described as \\"an essential guide\\", the book tells Garza's story as an activist and shares lessons for future activists. Additional work Garza's editorial writing has been published by The Guardian, The Nation, The Feminist Wire, Rolling Stone, HuffPost and Truthout. She currently directs Special Projects at the National Domestic Workers Alliance. Previously, Garza had served as the director of People Organized to Win Employment Rights (POWER) in the San Francisco Bay Area. During her time in the position, she won the right for youth to use public transportation for free in San Francisco and also fought gentrification and exposing police brutality in the area. Garza is an active participant in several Bay Area social movement groups. She is on the board of directors of Forward Together's Oakland California branch and is also involved with Black Organizing for Leadership and Dignity. She is also on the board of directors for Oakland's School of Unity and Liberation (SOUL). In 2011, she was the Chair person of Right to the City Alliance In 2015, Garza was selected as the Member's Choice for Community Grand Marshal at 2015 Pride celebration, as she was considered a local hero in Oakland for her contributions to the LGBTQ community and society at large. Over two dozen Black Lives Matter organizers and supporters marched in the Pride Parade behind Garza, who sat next to trans activist Miss Major, the previous year's Community Grand Marshal. =Notable speeches= Garza presented at the 2016 Bay Area Rising event, speaking about the propagation of Black Lives Matter and human rights. In 2017, Garza spoke to graduating students from San Francisco State University. In her speech, Garza praised the persistence of the black women who came before her, saying that they laid the foundation for modern activism: \\"Were it not for black women, there would be no Underground Railroad, no one to campaign against black bodies swinging from trees like strange fruit, there would be no protest songs like the ones that came from the toes, through the womb up, through the lungs and out of the brilliant mind and mouth of Nina Simone. There would be no black women voting like the 96 percent of us who did vote and said hell no to this administration. There would be no America were it not for black women. This is an ode to black women ‚Äì because black women are magic. [...] We, I, you and me ‚Äì we owe everything to black women. [...] Yes ‚Äì all lives, all contributions. But this? This is bigger than all that. This is about black women, cisgender, transgender, no gender, disabled, queer, immigrant black women who time and time again keep trying to tell y'all and more than that... keep showing y'all. We are magic.\\" =Acts of protest= Garza participated in an attempt to stop a Bay Area Rapid Transit train for four and a half hours, a time chosen to reflect the time that Michael Brown's body was left in the street after he was killed. The protesters stopped the train for an hour and a half by chaining themselves both to the inside of the train and the outside, making it impossible for the door to close. The event ended when police removed the protestors by dismantling part of the train. Activism in politics = Organization Supermajority = Supermajority was established in the spring of 2019 and is focused on creating political power for American women. The organization Supermajority was created by Garza, Cecile Richards, and Ai-jen Poo. Supermajority intends to \\"train and mobilize two million women across America to become organizers, activists, and leaders ahead of the 2020 election\\" to create a \\"multiracial, intergenerational movement for women's equality.\\" One of the main goals of Supermajority is to create \\"'a women's new deal,'\\" with women's issues like \\"voting rights, gun control, paid family leave, and equal pay\\" being seen as \\"issues that impact everyone\\" for the 2020 presidency, as well as build a greater platform for women in politics. In the 2020 election, cofounder Cecile Richards says \\"[the group will be successful] if 54% of voters in this country are women and if we are able to insert into this country the issues that women care about and elect a president who‚Äôs committed to doing something about them.\\" = Black Political Power = In 2018 Garza launched Black Futures Lab, whose goal is to engage with advocate organizations to advance policies that make black communities stronger. The first project for Black Futures Lab was the Black Census Project. This project was the largest survey on Black People since the Reconstruction era of the United States. The survey included questions on subjects such as political attitudes, organization affiliation, experiences with racism and police violence, perceptions of social movements, access to healthcare and economic well being. Black Future Labs plans to use the results of the Black Census Project to determine pressing legislative and policy issues. Garza divided the Black Census Project into creating separate studies focusing on the black LGBTQ community as well as the black community's political engagement in the United States. = 2016 Presidential election = While Garza has been critical of Donald Trump, she has also been critical of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, saying: \\"The Clintons use black people for votes, but then don't do anything for black communities after they're elected. They use us for photo ops.\\" She voted for Bernie Sanders in the California Democratic Primary, but promised to do everything in her power \\"to make sure that we are not led by Donald Trump\\", and she voted for Clinton in the general election. = 2020 Presidential Election = Garza gave a speech to a crowd of 200 students on the 2020 elections in celebration of Black History Month. She spoke about how the Black Lives Matter Movement is misinterpreted as being anti-white, anti- law enforcement, or a terrorist organization. In this speech, she showed support for the Green New Deal, condemned voter suppression, and called for more voter involvement. Garza endorsed Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary. Recognition and awards Garza was recognized on the Root 100 list of African American Achievers between the ages of 25 and 45. She was also recognized on the Politico50 2015 guide to Thinkers, Doers, and Visionaries, along with Cullors and Tometi. Garza has received the Local Hero award from the San Francisco Bay Guardian. She has been twice awarded by the Harvey Milk Democratic Club the Bayard Rustin Community Activist Award for her work fighting racism and gentrification in San Francisco. She has also been awarded the Jeanne Gauna Communicate Justice Award from the Centre for Media Justice. In 2015, Garza, Cullors, and Tometi (as \\"The Women of #BlackLivesMatter\\") were among the nine runners-up for The Advocates Person of the Year. In November 2017, Black Lives Matter founders Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi were awarded the Sydney Peace Prize. In 2018 Garza was named in the inaugural cohort of the Atlantic Fellows for Racial Equity (AFRE). This first cohort of 29 Atlantic Fellows are focused on challenging racism in the U.S. and South Africa and disrupting the rise of white nationalism and supremacy. In 2020, Garza was named to Fortune magazine's '40 Under 40' list under the \\"Government and Politics\\" category. Garza is included in Time magazine 's 100 Most Influential People of 2020.

Early life and education Karasz was born in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, the oldest of three children of Mary Huber Karasz and silversmith Samuel Karasz. One of her younger sisters was the fashion designer and textile artist Mariska Karasz. She studied art at the Royal Academy of Arts and Crafts during a period when the reigning aesthetic owed much to the Wiener Werkst√§tte and was one of the first women to be admitted to the school. She immigrated to the United States in 1913, the year of her 17th birthday, and began to make a career for herself in New York City‚Äòs Greenwich Village, where she established herself as an influential practitioner of modern art and design. In 1914, Karasz co-founded (with Winold Reiss) the European-American artists' collective Society of Modern Art, and shortly afterwards she was commissioned to create advertising for the department store Bonwit Teller. For a few years in the late teens she taught textile design at the Modern Art School. Career =Textile and industrial design= During her late teens, Karasz taught textile design at the Modern Art School, an institution founded in 1915, where she taught alongside Marguerite and William Zorach. Karasz and a group of other European-born artists and designers, including Winold Reiss, founded the Society of Modern Art in 1914. The organization published Modern Art Collector, which published much of Karasz‚Äôs early designs. Her first work presented in the journal was a theatrical poster with checkerboard motifs, a common Austrian-German graphic style. The publication also showcased her bold, stylized floral patterns, cover designs, book illustrations, typography, and decorative panels. Karasz was the founding director of Design Group, a firm of industrial designers, craftspeople, and artists. From the 1910s to the 1960s, her designs‚Äîinspired equally by folk art and modern art‚Äîfound their way into a wide variety of textiles, wallpaper, rugs, ceramics, furniture, silverware, and toys. Between 1916 and 1918 she won several prizes (and gained visibility) for textile designs entered in competitions run by the fashion magazine Women's Wear. As early as 1918, she was being called \\"one of the best designers of modern textiles,\\" while by 1950 she was considered one of America's leading wallpaper designers, known for experimenting with different methods for transfer and layering of images. In the 1950s, she was one of a handful of artists selected by the aluminum manufacturer Alcoa to experiment with the use of aluminum for wall coverings. Cover by Ilonka Karasz, The Masses, December 1915. Karasz did textile work throughout her career for manufacturers in the United States, including Mallinson, Schumacher, Lesher-Whitman, Dupont-Rayon, Schwarzenbach and Huber, Cheney, Susquehanna Silk Mills, Standard Textile, and Belding Brothers. One of her most successful designs, Oak Leaves, was commissioned by Lesher-Whitman and appeared in many publications on modern design and contemporary textiles. Karasz‚Äôs fellow designers considered her a pioneer in modern woven textiles in America, a field avoided by many textile creatives because of the requirement of having to understand the Jacquard loom. Karasz ventured into a number of unusual areas connected with textile design and production. She was known as a pioneer of modern textile designs requiring the use of the Jacquard loom, and she became one of the few women to design textiles for planes and cars. In the late 1920s, Dupont-Rayon Company hired her to help improve the texture and feel of rayon and generally raise the production standards for this then-new material. Karasz experimented with many new materials and manufacturing processes throughout her career. Her work for F. Schumacher and Company in 1929 was used in a Fokker airplane. Karasz's exploration of furniture and silverware was most intense in the late 1920s and 1930s. Her furniture was often rectilinear and strongly planar, inspired by the European De Stijl movement; she also designed a number of multifunctional pieces. In 1928, she was included in a European-American exhibition put on by Macy's department store in New York, alongside such prominent designers as Kem Weber, Bruno Paul, and Josef Hoffmann. In another 1928 exhibition, organized by American Designers' Gallery in New York, she was the only woman given responsibility for designing an entire room, and in fact she designed both a model studio apartment and a nursery. The latter is considered possibly the first modern nursery designed in America, and Karasz followed it up with several later nursery designs pragmatically featuring convertible furniture and washable fabrics. Her nursery designs focused on giving a child ‚Äúan intimate sense of owning a room instead of being owned by it.‚Äù Rooms that allowed children to explore and develop intellectual, dramatic, and spatial capabilities. She also tried to incorporate elements that would help very young children learn, such as color-coded knobs on dressers. Her simple design aesthetic for furniture reflected the attention to designing for mass production. From 1934-1937, Karasz designed and decorated ceramic dinner ware for Buffalo Pottery. =Illustration= During the illustration portion of her career, Karasz was often referred to as the ‚Äúhermit painter‚Äù. This nickname, however, misrepresents the repeated work she completed for various Greenwich Village publications and the impressions she made on peers. Karasz began painting covers for The New Yorker in 1924 and continued up to 1973. She had a total of 186 New Yorker covers across those six decades, many of them featuring lively vignettes of daily life viewed from above and drawn using unusual color combinations. She also created covers and illustrations for avant-garde magazines‚Äîincluding Guido Bruno's Bruno's Weekly, Modern Art Collector, and Playboy: A Portfolio of Art and Satire‚Äîas well as for children's books such as The Heavenly Tenants. Less well known are the numerous maps she created, mostly for books but also as magazine covers. Personal life In 1920 Karasz married Dutch chemist Willem Nyland (died 1975), with whom she had two children. They built a house in Brewster, New York, where Karasz lived for most of her life and which was featured in a 1928 spread in House Beautiful magazine. The couple lived in Java between 1929 and 1931, where Karasz complemented her eclectic mix of modern and traditional furnishings with murals that paid homage to the surrounding tropical foliage. Death and legacy Karasz died at her daughter's home in Warwick, New York, seven weeks before her 85th birthday. The year after she died, the New York gallery Fifty/50 mounted a solo show of her work. In 2003, a retrospective of her paintings, prints, and drawings entitled \\"Enchanting Modern: Ilonka Karasz, 1896‚Äì1981,\\" was mounted by the Georgia Museum of Art. Several dozen of her drawings and sample books for wallpaper, rugs, and metalware are in the collection of the Cooper Hewitt Museum.

Early life  Shapiro was born in Santa Barbara, California, to mother Diane Wolf (n√©e Wallace) and father Perry Shapiro, a professor. She has a sister, Elizabeth Shapiro-Garza, who is an academic. Shapiro said she started writing when she was five years old, a book called Ergant Cries Ignored. At the age of 16, after attending a film class at Santa Barbara City College, Shapiro decided she wanted to be a director. Shapiro graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in with a BA in Fiction Writing and Filmmaking.  Career  After college, Shapiro interned at Christine Vachon's production company, Killer Films, and then worked for photographer David LaChapelle as a studio manager. In 2002, affected by the events of September 11 attacks and wanting to be closer to family, Shapiro moved to Los Angeles, California. In Los Angeles, Shapiro found work on the reality TV show High School Reunion, unknowingly signing a contract with the production company that allowed them to move her to different shows at their discretion, and which committed Shapiro to \\"unlimited renewable options for perpetuity.\\" Shapiro would eventually become a producer on The Bachelor TV franchise, a role she strongly disliked, but which would play an influential part in her later career. She worked on the show for four seasons over the course of two years, going from associate producer to field producer. In 2005, seeking to leave reality television and end her restrictive non-compete employment contract (which was only effective in California), Shapiro moved to Portland, Oregon, where she worked at the advertising agency Wieden + Kennedy. Shapiro was familiar with Portland from having interned at Portland's Northwest Film Center during college, where she met filmmakers Miranda July and other local artists and filmmakers. Initially she planned to be a kale farmer. At Wieden + Kennedy, Shapiro worked as a director, creating content in the form of short forms and documentaries. Wieden + Kennedy was an early supporter of her creative endeavors, allowing Shapiro to take leave and providing funding for a Kickstarter campaign for Sequin Raze. Shapiro worked on Sequin Raze, which she called a passion project, for four years while working at Wieden + Kennedy. In 2012, she was one of eight women selected for the American Film Institute's Directing Workshop for Women (DWW), where she wrote and directed the short film Sequin Raze, starring Anna Camp, Ashley Williams, and Frances Conroy. The film went on to win Honorable Mention at South by Southwest Film Festival's Short Film Jury Awards as well as screenings at the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York (MoMA/Lincoln Center) and Palm Springs International film festival. = UnREAL = A mentor at the ad agency in Portland, Sally DeSipio, connected Shapiro with Lifetime, where she pitched the show without an agent, and was paired with writer Marti Noxon. On July 30, 2013, Lifetime placed a pilot order on UnREAL, inspired by Sequin Raze. The pilot was written by Shapiro and Marti Noxon and was produced by A+E Studios. On February 6, 2014, UnREAL was green-lit, with a 10-episode series order, and premiered in June 2015. Shapiro is credited as co-creator, writer, and supervising producer on the show. On July 6, 2015, the series was renewed for a second season of 10 episodes, to premiere in 2016. She spoke about the creation of the series in a lengthy 2016 profile with The New Yorker writer D.T. Max. Shapiro's previous job working as a field producer on the American reality dating series The Bachelor was the inspiration behind both the short film as well as the Lifetime series. She talked about her journey navigating the world of Hollywood in an independent Tedx TED Conference.  Other work  While attending Sarah Lawrence College, Shapiro formed the band The New England Roses with Brendan Fowler and JD Samson of indie band Le Tigre. During her time while working on The Bachelor, Shapiro was in a band called Mean Streak. Shapiro is also a visual artist who created and wrote the music for a hand- animated film called I Wish I was an Animal, which was released on Doggpony Records.

Stimmel studied at the California School of Fine Arts and in 1938, graduated from the University of California, Berkeley. She also earned a teaching credential from Stanford University. In 1939, she married Julius Chase. She received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the California College of Arts and Crafts in 1961. Her thesis was titled \\"A discriminative study of the growth and development of the ceramic industry in California and its relation to the studio potter in the San Francisco Bay Area\\". Art career Around 1946, she began working with California Faience, producing ceramic figurines. Her work was marketed across the country. According to Chase, her products were sold at high end retailers like Marshall Field's in Chicago and Garfinckel's in Washington, DC. She also produced ceramic tiles, and was called the \\"backbone of the artistic community\\" at California Faience during her six years there. In the 1960s, Chase started a ceramics workshop in Berkeley, California, where she produced mostly handmade tile in the style she had learned from William Bragdon at California Faience. She later moved her gallery to Point Richmond, followed by Oakland. Her painting style in the 1970s incorporated elements of Pop art and Op art.

She lives and works in Amsterdam and Berlin. Her work focuses on issues of technology, evolutionary processes, digital imagery and corporate aesthetics. Novitskova is interested in investigating how, \\"media actively redefines the world and culture, and everything\\" related to art, nature and commerce. Education Novitskova holds degrees in Semiotics and Cultural Studies as well as a specialization in Media Arts from the University of Tartu, Estonia. She also completed a Masters of Science in Digital Media, University of L√ºbeck, Germany in addition to studying at the Graphic Design department at the Sandberg Instituut, Amsterdam. Further funding and research for her artistic practice has been supported by the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds, the residency programme for visual artists at the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten and the Mondriaan Fund. Work Novitskova has shown at SALTS, Basel, Bard Centre for Curatorial Studies with Timur Si-Qin, M HKA, Antwerp, Belgium and at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing. Key themes in her practice have evolved from an interest in post-internet art practices, technology and the biological evolution within the current geological era (the Anthropocene). A re-occurring theme in her works are images of animals sourced online, which appear larger than life in her installations and are digitally printed onto aluminium. These works belong specifically to a series of images titled Approximation. For her first solo exhibition Macro Expansion she reassembled images from online search engines by filtering them into recombinations influenced by advertisement and corporate branding. By lifting images from their \\"natural\\" habitat she wished to demonstrate the evolutionary processes of technological advancement, economic expansion and positivistic adaptations to flora, fauna and humankind. Novitskova was also a contributor to Digital Life Design Women14 in Munich, an exhibition moderated by the art curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist where she presented \\"Patterns of Activation\\". Regarding her text \\"Post Internet Survival Guide\\", Novitskova has stated that, \\"The notion of a survival guide arises as an answer to a basic human need to cope with increasing complexity.

Although lost in 1955, three photos of this painting were taken between 1940 and 1944. The painting was first displayed in January 1940 at the International Surrealism Exhibit at In√©s Amor's Gallery of Mexican Art in Mexico City, and a replica is currently displayed in the Kunstmuseum Gehrke-Remund, Baden-Baden, Germany. The painting was last exhibited in Warsaw in 1955, after which it disappeared, and is the subject of an ongoing international search. Description The painting reflects ongoing themes in Kahlo's work, including Mexicanidad, indigeneity, self-portraiture, and grief/loss. Kahlo is seated at the center of the table where figures previously seen in her painting The Four Inhabitants of Mexico City also appear. The table is spattered with blood and framed by a theatrical curtain, providing a stagelike setting, and she is surrounded by a precolumbian Nayarit figurine (part of her by now ex-husband Diego Rivera's collection), a papier- m√¢ch√© skeleton (often called a Judas-like figure), two children, and her pet deer Granizo. In The Wounded Table, \\"Kahlo is no longer a bewildered child but an adult-sized Kahlo sitting at the table.\\" Kahlo bleeds as a martyr for Mexicanidad, she comments on the performative aspects of Mexican identity. It supports Roger Bartr‚Äôs analysis of post-revolutionary culture. In The Wounded Table, Kahlo parodies the stereotypes of mexicanness. \\"A Tehuana-clad Kahlo shares a long table with the cord- and dynamite-wrapped male figure and the skeleton of Four Inhabitants. Her long dark hair is lifted up and draped over the skeleton's arm, tying the two figures together. Seated between Kahlo and the skeleton is a small Nayarit sculpture. The long arm of the sculpture extends toward Kahlo and, near her shoulder, merges with hers. Blood oozes from wounds in the table, the man's feet, and the skeleton. It pools near the hem of the Tehuana dress and splatters onto the skirt. Blood is never far removed from the heart, and in this particular work the skeleton is touched by the bloodheart linking the skeletal death figure with the heart-life.\\" Attempted sale In June 2019 Mexican authorities announced the arrest of a man in Morelos State who was attempting to sell the painting. Officials were tipped off when he attempted to have the contract of sale certified by a notary public. According to the documents, the painting would have been sent to a buyer in London in exchange for a Mex$20 million house in Acapulco. Mexican officials said the sale could have been a fraud since the detainee did not physically present the painting.

She works in a variety of media including woodcuts, reverse glass paintings, sculpture, video, and performance. She creates connections between art history and social or ethical issues, with a particular interest in notions of poverty, shame, vulnerability and dignity, and the belief systems that underpin them. B√ºttner has exhibited in both Europe and North America. Currently, she lives and works in both London and Frankfurt am Main. B√ºttner uses a broad range of media and techniques most notably video, performance, and installation art. However, her work is not limited to these mediums as she utilizes collage, sculpture, and more to discuss myths, gender, religion, shame, and society. Life and work Born in 1972 in Stuttgart, Andrea B√ºttner studied fine art at the Berlin University of the Arts. From 2003 to 2004, she studied at the University of T√ºbingen and Humboldt University, where she received a master's degree in art history and philosophy. From 2005 to 2010, she joined the Royal College of Art in London and received her doctorate. Her thesis \\"Aesthetics of Shame: The relevance of shame for contemporary art and visual culture\\" focused on the subject of shame, including its queer aspects, as an aesthetic feeling. Religion is a recurring theme in her work, from her video Little Sisters: Lunapark Ostia (2012), which documents B√ºttner in conversation with religious sisters. The video features nuns in an amusement park outside of Rome partaking in rides and attractions while discussing their own work. Little Sisters: Lunapark Ostia (2012) is not B√ºttner's only work to feature nuns, her short film Little Works (2007) features nuns making small objects, such as candles. B√ºttner's other work Vogelpredigt (Sermon to the Birds, 2010) reflects Christian iconography.

It was recognized as one of the central landmarks for LGBTQ culture, especially for lesbians and queer women, in San Francisco. The club was founded in 1997 and closed at the end of April 2015.  History  The Lexington Club was opened in 1997 by Lila Thirkield as a response to the numerous options for gay men but lack of options for lesbians and other queer women in San Francisco. She noticed that 16th and Mission had a \\"significant dyke presence\\" there and decided that it would make a good spot for her lesbian-owned business. Other such businesses and services in the area catering to queer women included The Women's Building, the Osento bathhouse, Old Wives Tales bookstore, and Amelia's bar, which had closed in 1991. The Lexington's site had previously housed a Mexican bar, Sunset. In October 2014, Thirkield announced that she would sell the Lexington Club and close the establishment in 2015. Thirkield cited rising rent and the changing neighborhood as factors behind her decision to sell, specifically the decline of LGBT patrons residing in the area that made the business unsustainable. She is a co-owner of another bar in the Mission, Virgil's Sea Room. In February 2015, she announced that the Lexington Club would close at the end of April, and that she sold the bar to the PlumpJack Group. The space is now a bar called Wildhawk.  Closing and response  The bar closed on April 30, 2015, the last remaining lesbian bar in San Francisco. Community members, including the GLBT Historical Society and Supervisor David Campos, initiated a fundraiser for a commemorative plaque. It was unveiled in a ceremony on September 19, 2016. Commemorative sidewalk plaque outside the former Lexington Club The Lexington Club Archival Project was started by two filmmakers, Susie Smith and Lauren Tabak, in early 2015. The project's mission is stated on their website as: \\"dedicated to documenting the stories, sounds and images from San Francisco's last full-time lesbian bar, which closed April 30th 2015.\\" The San Francisco International Film Festival screened a short version of the project's work-in-progress documentary film Never a Cover on April 30, 2015.

The monthly exhibitions at Savernack Street usually feature a single piece of artwork that appears larger or life size when viewed through the peephole.

History  Savernack Street Gallery was founded in 2013 by artist Carrie Sinclair Katz shortly after receiving her MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute. The artist said her motivation was to comment on the difficulties an emerging artist faces when trying to crack into the art world and that the small size of the gallery and its limited access was ‚Äú[..] a practical issue about how much square footage in San Francisco costs right now‚Äù and was all she could afford. In May 2015, Katz also stated a motivation for Savernack Street Gallery \\"[...]was trying to play with expectations and make people question why they had certain expectations [of an art viewing experience]‚Äù.

According to his account, this triggered a revelatory near- death experience. Allegedly inspired by this experience, Hubbard composed a manuscript, which was never published, with working titles of The One Command or Excalibur. The contents of Excalibur formed the basis for some of his later publications. =Advertisement= By 1957, Hubbard had advertised a \\"very limited edition\\" of Excalibur at a price of $1,500 per copy. Hubbard's ad cautions that \\"four of the first fifteen people who read it went insane\\". He promised that the work contained \\"data not to be released during Mr. Hubbard's stay on earth\\". =Story of Soviet involvement= In 1962, Hubbard wrote a letter addressed to President Kennedy in which he claimed Soviet agents had stolen a manuscript copy of Excalibur in 1950. In 1964, Hubbard gave an interview claiming that Soviet agents had \\"offered him $100,000 and laboratory facilities he needed in the USSR, so that he could complete his work\\". =Published excerpt= In an introduction published in 1991, Hubbard writes about his near-death experience. Under the influence of the gas, he speculates that \\"my heart must have stopped beating\\". He described his experience as \\"slipping through the Curtain and into the land of shades\\". A published excerpt introduced a story: \\"Once upon a time, according to a writer in The Arabian Nights, there lived a very wise old man.\\" The old man attempts to collect and distill all the knowledge in the world. After narrowing the work from a massive volume down to a single page and finally a single sentence: \\"All life is directed by one command and one command only‚ÄîSURVIVE!\\" Witnesses Multiple witnesses attest to the existence of Excalibur manuscripts. =Arthur J. Burks= Arthur J. Burks, who read the work in 1938, later recalled it discussed the \\"one command\\": to survive. This theme would be revisited in Dianetics. Burks also recalled the work discussing the psychology of a lynch mob. Hubbard would later cite Excalibur as an early version of Dianetics. In 1938, Burks wrote \\"The Great Amen\\", a story about a red-haired soldier who claimed to have come back from the dead. In 1939, Burks published a story entitled \\"Survival\\" in Marvel Science Stories. In 1961, Burks published an account publicly confirming the existence of Excalibur. =Forrest J. Ackerman= Hubbard literary agent Forrest Ackerman Forrest J. Ackerman was Hubbard's literary agent in the late 1940s. By Ackerman's account, Hubbard claimed the near-death experience had occurred not in a dentist's office but on an \\"operating table\\" sometime \\"during the war\\". Finding himself outside of his body, he was drawn to a \\"great ornate gate\\". Ackerman recalled that \\"on the other side of this gate spread out like an intellectual smorgasbord as the SUM TOTAL OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE!\\" In a 1949 letter to Ackerman, Hubbard discusses his work \\"DARK SWORD -cause and cure of nervous tension ‚Äì properly ‚Äì THE SCIENCE OF MIND, really EXCALIBUR\\". Hubbard promises that the work will give the reader the power to \\"rape women without their knowing it, communicate suicide messages to your enemies as they sleep, sell the Arroyo Seco Parkway to the mayor for cash, evolve the best way of protecting or destroying communism, and other handy house hold hints.\\" Hubbard assured Ackerman that the book had \\"more selling and publicity angles than any book of which I have ever heard.\\" In the same month, he told Writers' Markets and Methods magazine that he was working on a \\"book of psychology\\". Hubbard cautions his friend \\"If you go crazy, remember you were warned\\", adding that a \\"good publishing trick\\" is to require that buyers sign a legal waiver \\"releasing the author of all responsibilities if the reader goes nuts\\". =Gerry Armstrong= In 1980, the Church assigned Gerry Armstrong, then a member of the Church's elite Sea Org, to organize Hubbard's personal papers. Armstrong reported the existence of three drafts of Excalibur. Armstrong recalled that \\"Hubbard had a couple of teeth extracted, and it was while under the effect of nitrous oxide that he came up with Excalibur\\". Robert Vaughn Young also reported the existence of three manuscript copies of Excalibur among the archives. Influence on Dianetics On March 8, 1949, Hubbard wrote to friend and fellow science-fiction author Robert Heinlein from Savannah, Georgia. Hubbard referenced Heinlein's earlier work Coventry, in which a utopian government has the ability to psychologically \\"cure\\" criminals of violent personality traits. Wrote Hubbard: \\"Excalibur\\" symbolism Scientology purchased a ship and Hubbard renamed it \\"the Excalibur\\". Hubbard named his youngest son Arthur.

She is a member of San Francisco's Mission School art movement. Her work is considered to have Na√Øve or Folk character, and often uses unconventional media like housepaint, graphite, or other found materials. She is currently based in Oakland, California.  Early life and education  McCarthy was born in 1969 and grew up in Oakland, California. She received her BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1993 and an MFA from UC Berkeley in 2007.http://www.jackhanley.com/artists/alicia- mccarthy In 1992, the dean of the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) addressed an angry letter criticizing her campus graffiti, claiming that her art \\"looks like shit\\". Ironically, McCarthy is now featured as a part of SFAI's notable alumni.  Career  McCarthy was a key member of the Mission School movement, an punk artistic movement born in San Francisco. McCarthy painted graffiti under the names Fancy and Probe. She was a member of underground punk and LGBT movements in San Francisco in the early 1990s. The Jack Hanley Gallery (San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York) has represented McCarthy for over 15 years including a solo New York City show and a two-person exhibition. In 2015, McCarthy had two major exhibitions: Snobody at V1 Gallery in Copenhagen and also Alicia McCarthy + Jenny Sharaf at Johansson Projects in Oakland. Most recently McCarthy participated in Major Work, curated by Andrew Schoultz at Chandran Gallery, San Francisco, and has also recently participated in Patterned Chaos at Cinders, New York, Off the Grid, curated by Susette Min at EN EM Art Space, Sacramento, Fertile Ground: Art and Community in California at The Oakland Museum of California Art and Pierogi X X: Twentieth Anniversary Exhibition at Pierogi in New York. In 2013, McCarthy exhibited in Energy That Is All Around: Mission School with Chris Johanson, Margaret Kilgallen, Alicia McCarthy, Barry McGee, Ruby Neri at the Walter and McBean Galleries, San Francisco Art Institute and the Grey Art Gallery, New York University. McCarthy currently lives and works in Oakland, and incorporates California's culture into her much of her work. Although she has not been arrested since 2000, McCarthy has participated and advocated for the use of graffiti and street art in protest of capitalism. McCarthy's work, as part of the larger Mission School movement, is a direct response to the Dot-com bubble's effect on San Francisco's urban development.  Mission School  The Mission School was composed of five artists all born in the late 1960s and living and working in the 1990s in San Francisco's Mission District when it was still a low-rent neighborhood. The artists bonded over punk music, skateboarding, graffiti, queer politics and zine publishing, and they shared an appreciation for funky cartooning, offbeat social satire, quirky abstraction, folk art and old- fashioned graphic styles. Combining craft/folk art and urban street and graffiti culture, Alicia McCarthy and this Mission School group of artists cultivated an art style that prized the handmade in an increasingly technologized society. McCarthy's art featured punk messages transformed into poetic and geometric forms.  Style & materials  Alicia McCarthy, Untitled (2013) McCarthy creates abstract paintings that fuse the aesthetics of American punk with those of outsider artists (a style sometimes referred to as \\"urban rustic\\"). She uses a variety of different kinds of paint (gouache, house paint, spray paint), often on found wood or paper and sometimes including text. Her radiating zigzags, interweaving lines, and stripes of bright colors have a handmade quality that appear as if they are moving with an internal energy. Found objects, text, and spray paint often make their way into these wood surfaces, so that McCarthy's colorful woven patterns and geometric blocks become personalized beyond their shapes. McCarthy's paintings are visually abstract, and yet her deceptively simple motifs ‚Äî a weave or rainbow, for instance ‚Äî are deeply personal and her works often include a clue of her personal and physical presence, such as the ring left by a coffee cup, print from a boot or a note written by the artist.  Works  She is best known for her weave paintings, in which multi-colored lines weave together. She is also known for her series of color wheels, composed of shattered and interlocking arcs of color. She was also one of fifteen Bay Artists commissioned by Facebook in 2015 to create a site specific spray paint mural for their new Frank Gehry-designed Menlo Park headquarters. McCarthy's recent work shows a selective color palette on mixed-media panels to create art that is both intense and playful. Exhibitions McCarthy's work has been shown at the Dallas Museum of Art, the Berkeley Art Center, and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. Her work was featured at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in July 2017. In 2013, her work was included in a major traveling exhibition, which was shown at the Craft and Folk Art Museum in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Art Institute, and the Grey Art Gallery at New York University. *Fertile Ground: Art and Community in California, Oakland Museum of California (Sep, 2014) *Snobody, V1 Gallery (Jan, 2015) *Landscape: the virtual, the actual, the possible?, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (Oct, 2014) *PIEROGI X X: Twentieth Anniversary Exhibition, Pierogi (Sep, 2014) *Alicia McCarthy + Jenny Sharaf, Johansson Projects (Jun, 2014) *ENERGY THAT IS ALL AROUND/Mission School: Chris Johanson, Margaret Kilgallen, Alicia McCarthy, Barry McGee, Ruby Neri, Grey Art Gallery, NYU (Apr, 2014) *Alicia McCarthy, Berggruen Gallery (March 2017) =Energy that is All Around= Energy that Is All Around was a formative exhibition of Mission School artists, curated by Natasha Boas at the San Francisco Art Institute.

She creates site-specific sculptures and installations. She is a 2012 recipient of the SECA Art Award. She was also a 2017‚Äì2018 Pollock-Krasner Foundation grantee. Abdalian's first solo exhibition in New York, at Clifton Benevento, presents a constellation of subtly altered found objects that echo the features of the gallery and of each other. Abdalian's works have consistently explored liminal zones, from her simulation of broken glass on the windows of her graduate school building to reflect the dilapidated surrounding neighborhood, to her timed light installation in an abandoned storefront for the 2013 Shanghai Biennial. Born and raised in New Orleans, Abdalian is particularly attentive to the ways in which historical processes are embedded in physical transformations of spaces.  Biography  Abdalian obtained a Bachelor of Arts from Tulane University in 2003 and graduated with a Master of Fine Arts from the California College of the Arts in 2010. Work Abdalian produces site-specific sculptural works and interventions. Prior to focusing on her site-specific work, Abdalian worked in printmaking and painting. She became more interested in working directly with the elements of space after a 2004 exhibition in a non-traditional venue. Her works respond directly to architectural and outdoor spaces, using sound, light, and other natural forces to create subtle experiences that are open to multiple interpretations. She had a 2013 show called \\"Zarouhie Abdalian / MATRIX 249\\" at the Berkeley Art Museum, with sculptures that are sensitive to the exhibition space. The sculptures were set up to use the out-of-the-way location of the gallery and aspects of the walls and space as part of the effect of the art. In 2013 she also installed a sound sculpture, \\"Occasional Music\\", in Frank H. Ogawa Plaza in Oakland, with brass bells that occasionally ring together out of sight.

She was a charter apprentice at Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin, and the first former Taliesin fellow to join the MoMA staff. She was an influential advocate for modern architecture in the United States. Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Bauer Mock Kassler was born in Lexington, Massachusetts in 1911 as Elizabeth Bauer to Alberta Krouse Bauer, a homemaker, and Jacob Bauer, a New Jersey state highway engineer. Her older sister was Catherine Bauer Wurster, a prominent public housing advocate and urban planning educator, and her younger brother was Louis Bauer. She graduated from the Vail Deane School in 1928. In 1932 she graduated from Vassar College, where she majored in English. After college she became one of the first fellows at Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äôs Taliesin studio near Spring Green, Wisconsin. It was at Taliesin where she met her first husband, Rudolph Mock, a draftsman from Basel, Switzerland who worked in Wright‚Äôs studio from January 1931 to April 1933. After their marriage, they briefly lived in Switzerland. Her involvement with the MoMA started in 1937 when she began working part-time for the museum‚Äôs Curator of Architecture and Industrial Design, John McAndrew. A year later she co-circulated her first exhibition, ‚ÄúWhat is Modern Architecture?‚Äù. She became McAndrew‚Äôs full-time assistant in 1940. When McAndrew was dismissed in 1942, Mock became the director. She remained at MoMA until 1946. During her time there, she produced many exhibits, including: ‚ÄúBuilt in the U.S.A.: 1932‚Äì1944‚Äù (1944), ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äôs Small House: Models and Plans‚Äù (1945), and ‚ÄúIf You Want to Build a House‚Äù. She curated seven MoMA exhibitions in total between 1938 and 1946. In 1946 and 1947, she and Rudolph lived in Knoxville, TN designing pre-fab housing for the Tennessee Valley Authority. Some of the buildings were in Fontana Village. In 1948, she separated from Rudolph and moved to Taliesin West with her son Fritz for one season. In 1949 she became an assistant professor of architectural history and librarian at the University of Oklahoma. After her divorce, she married Kenneth Stone Kassler in 1951 and moved to Princeton, New Jersey. In Princeton she continued to write for architecture journals, the MoMA, and popular magazines. Kassler died in 1964, the same year Bauer became a research associate at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning at Princeton University where she served until 1971. According to Concordia University's Research Chair in Art History, Kristina Huneault, Mock's books \\"strove to persuade a new generation of homebuyers of how modernism might improve their lives and the quality of North American architectural culture overall.‚Äù They include If You Want to Build a House (1946), The Architecture of Bridges (1949), and Modern Gardens and the Landscape (1964, known then as Elizabeth B. Kassler). Her book on bridges is described by Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as \\"the first major book on bridges to give a modern viewpoint.\\" Modern Gardens and the Landscape is considered the authoritative survey of its subject. It was billed by the MoMA as \\"the first book to discuss the relationship between the modern garden and the natural landscape in terms of contemporary aesthetics.\\" Modern Gardens and the Landscape included the works of Burle Marx, Bernard Rudofsky, Gunnar Asplund and Luis Barragan. Her books were all published by the Museum of Modern Art. A 1979 visit to Taliesin West inspired her to put together a retrospective directory of the Taliesin Fellowship in time for its 50th anniversary (in 1982). She collected all the listings herself, and in 1981 published 450 copies of The Directory, 1932‚Äì1982, The Taliesin Fellowship, A Directory of Members. This was the first such directory in Taliesin history and it inspired the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to develop similar directories. In 1990 she retired to a retirement community in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Her work is represented by Aspect/Ratio in Chicago, IL.  Themes  Holman works across media in drawings, sculpture, photography and video. Her work often combines all of these in low-fi video productions that involve masks, costumes, and the choreography of multiple participants. Holman‚Äôs work is concerned with the performance of identity, alternative realities, and the relationship between self and other.  Exhibitions  In 2009, her work was shown in Los Angeles in the exhibition ‚ÄòHammer Projects: Desir√©e Holman.‚Äô Holman's project,‚ÄòReborn,‚Äô featured drawings, three-channel video installation and sculpture. The work was inspired by a subculture of women (primarily in the U.S. and Great Britain) called ‚Äòreborners‚Äô who care for incredibly lifelike baby dolls, bathing and feeding them as they would a real infant. Holman created her own realistic dolls and drew Mary Cassatt inspired images of mothers and their babies. The exhibition was organized by Hammer Curator Ali Subotnick. In 2011 Holman's exhibition ‚ÄòHeterotopias‚Äô was shown as part of the MATRIX 238 program at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. The exhibition included drawings and video. Holman had nine performers imagine alternate identities to create an avatar, or surrogate self, for which she then created props and costumes. Performers used the props and costumes to act out their character in a choreographed music video. She then had each performer fully rendered as a 3-D model in a virtual gamescape.

Segments were directed by Neil Marshall, Darren Lynn Bousman, Axelle Carolyn, Lucky McKee, Andrew Kasch, Paul Solet, John Skipp, Adam Gierasch, Jace Anderson, Mike Mendez, Ryan Schifrin, and Dave Parker. The film had its world premiere on July 24, 2015, at the Fantasia International Film Festival. It was released in a limited release and through video on demand on October 16, 2015, by Epic Pictures. Synopsis The ten stories take place in a suburban American town whose denizens are terrorized by ghouls, aliens, and killers one Halloween night as a DJ (Adrienne Barbeau) adds her commentary to a few of them. =Sweet Tooth= :Written and directed by Dave Parker. Mikey (Daniel DiMaggio) has just finished trick-or-treating around his neighborhood and come home with a bag full of candy. His parents (Greg Grunberg and Clare Kramer) have left him in the care of his babysitter Lizzy (Madison Iseman), who has invited her boyfriend Kyle over to watch the film Night of the Living Dead. As Mikey begins to enjoy the candy he's collected, Lizzy and Kyle share the urban legend of \\"Sweet Tooth\\"; long ago, a boy of Mikey's age named Timothy was denied his trick-or-treat candy by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Blake, but a curious Timothy discovered that the parents kept and ate all his candy themselves. Enraged, Timothy killed both of his parents and ate all the candy, but he wanted more, so he ate the ones already in his parents' stomach, and thus became Sweet Tooth, a demon who appears each Halloween looking for candy. The story concludes with the warning that children have to leave some candy to share with Sweeth Tooth or he will open your stomach for the ones already eaten. Mikey is rattled by this story and decides to go to sleep early. Despite Lizzy telling him Sweet Tooth is nothing but a story, Mikey still leaves a candy bar by the door. Lizzy and Kyle decide to make out and eat the candy, before being attacked by Sweet Tooth himself, which Mikey overhears. The ghostly being heads toward Mikey's bedroom but spares him and leaves after taking the candy he left. Later, Mikey's parents come home to find Lizzy and Kyle's grotesque corpses, with Mikey standing nearby exclaiming that they ate all his Halloween candy. We later learn in \\"Bad Seed\\" that Mikey was believed to have murdered Lizzy and Kyle himself and was arrested. =The Night Billy Raised Hell= :Written by Clint Sears, directed by Darren Lynn Bousman. Billy Thompson (Marcus Eckert) absurdly tries to start trick-or-treating early in the afternoon, prompting his older sister Britney (Natalis Castillo) and her boyfriend Todd (Ben Stillwell) to trick him into playing a prank, that, according to both teenagers, has been going on for years. They prepare an egg for Billy to throw at Mr. Abbadon's (Barry Bostwick) house, who is notoriously stingy and has never given out candy to the children over the years, but Billy is caught red-handed as his sister and her boyfriend flee. Billy is ushered into Mr. Abbadon's house, where he says he's going to teach Billy a lesson. Mr. Abbadon drives the young boy Mordecai, dressed in a red devil costume and mask similar to Billy's, around the neighborhood to cause mischief, ranging from spray-painting walls to more bloody terrors, including stabbing a rude neighbor who gave him a toothbrush instead of candy then later tricking the same neighbor into stepping on a bear trap, severing his foot. The duo even hijack Adrianne Curry's car along the way. After all the ruckus, Mr. Abbadon returns to his house and unties Billy, revealing that he is the Devil himself and under the mask Mordecai is also the Little Devil. He lets Billy go, only for Billy to be surrounded by police officers waiting for him outside for the reign of terror Mordecai caused in his Devil costume. A terrified Billy puts his hands in the air but pees his pants, and the disgusted police officers mock Billy just before they both shoot him dead. =Trick= :Written by Greg Commons, directed by Adam Gierasch. On a seemingly peaceful Halloween night, friends Nelson (Trent Haaga), Maria (Tiffany Shepis), James (John F. Beach) and Caitlyn (Casey Ruggieri) are lounging around Nelson's house, smoking pot. As Nelson goes to greet a girl trick-or-treating, the group is alarmed when the girl stabs Nelson multiple times in the abdomen, gravely injuring him. Panicked, Maria goes to her car to drive Nelson to the hospital, only to be attacked by four kids in costumes. Maria flees, but the injury causes her to drop dead on the house's pool. By this time, Nelson has succumbed to his injury and dies as well. James tries to find help, only to have his face burned by yet another trick-or-treater, and she completes her attack by stuffing his mouth with rat poison, killing him. Caitlyn, the only adult left, flees to the backyard, where she hides in a shack. It is then revealed that Caitlyn, Nelson, Maria and James are all psychopaths and have been kidnapping kids and torturing them for their amusement. The group of kids finds the shack, which turns out to be the place they tortured the previous kids, and cornered Caitlyn. A girl, whose one eye has been gouged by the adults, executes Caitlyn with an axe on her head. =The Weak and the Wicked= :Written by Molly Millions, directed by Paul Solet. Three bullies, Alice (Grace Phipps), Isaac (Booboo Stewart) and Bart (Noah Segan) proceed to torture a kid after trick-or-treating (Jack Dylan Grazer), but are interrupted by a teenager in a devil costume (Keir Gilchrist). The teenager hands Alice a drawing of a demon and warns Alice that the Demon will \\"spill the blood of the wicked where the wicked have harmed the weak\\". Alice dismisses the picture, and begins to chase the teenager away with the other bullies to the other side of the city, where the teenager stops by a burnt-down trailer car. In a flashback when Alice, Bart and Isaac were kids, they set the house on fire, which belonged to the teenager, complete with his parents inside it. When the bullies show up they recognize the teen as Jimmy Henson and proceed to beat him up and prepare to light him on fire, Bart and Isaac are attacked by an unseen force. When Alice turns around, a creature known as the Demon of All Hallow's Eve has shown up, looking exactly like Jimmy wearing his costume (as we learn in a flashback that the picture Alice dropped was actually instructions on how to summon it). As Alice is killed by the Demon, blood violently splashes on Jimmy's face, who smiles in satisfaction. =Grim Grinning Ghost= :Written and directed by Axelle Carolyn. Lynn (Alex Essoe) prepares to leave her mother's (Lin Shaye) Halloween party after hearing her mother recount a ghost story about a girl named Mary Bailey who was mocked her whole life for her disfigured physical appearance. As a ghost, Mary now appears on Halloween to laugh at people's appearances behind their backs, and takes the eyes of those who turn around to look at her. On her way home, her old car breaks down in the middle of the road, forcing her to finish her trip by foot. While walking, she senses that a shadowy figure, the one from her mother's story, is following her. Terrified, she runs into the safety of her house. She turns around to see nothing so she believes the figure has not followed her to her house. As Lynn settles to a couch to watch a film, her dog suddenly gets nervous and leaves the room. Lynn smiles and leans back to the couch, only to find out that Mary is sitting beside her. We later learn in \\"Bad Seed\\" that she succeeded in taking Lynn's eyesight but the police dismiss it as \\"hysterical blindness\\". =Ding Dong= :Written and directed by Lucky McKee. A year prior, Jack (Marc Senter) and his wife Bobbie (Pollyanna McIntosh) watch as children trick or treat on Halloween night. Bobbie is distraught by the fact she has no children of her own, to which Jack tries to cheer her up by dressing their dog as Gretel. This leads things to get heated and ends up with Bobbie suddenly turning into a red demonic witch and clawing Jack's face with her long, devilish nails. In the present time, Jack and Bobbie have prepared to greet trick-or-treaters, dressed as Hansel and a witch respectively, to Jack‚Äôs worry. Even though everything goes normally, with Bobbie excitedly performing a skit to the delight of the children, something feels uneasy between the couple every time there's children on their front porch. Finally, when a boy also dressed as Hansel is visiting the couple's house alone, Bobbie prepares to lead him inside, but Jack, aware of his wife's intent, alerts the boy's mother, who's looking for him. A disheartened Bobbie goes back inside, and Jack persuades her to stop what they're doing, telling her that it wouldn‚Äôt be right to have children of their own with the abusive way she treats him. Bobbie then appears to transform into the witch from Hansel and Gretel who eats children, and when Jack reveals he's secretly had a vasectomy to prevent a pregnancy, she becomes distraught and furious. She drags Jack into the house's oven, which resembles Hell, and ends up melting herself. =This Means War= :Written and directed by Andrew Kasch and John Skipp. Boris (Dana Gould) has proudly finished his Halloween-decorated house. But when children are about to greet his house, they are scared away because of his neighbor, Dante (James Duval) has set-up a rock and gore-oriented Halloween decorations on his house, complete with loud rock music blasting from the speakers. Boris walks up to Dante's yard to ask him to turn the volume lower, but Dante and his colleagues just laugh at him and mock his decorations. Enraged, Boris wrecks the sound system and halts the music, but Dante exacts revenge by planning to throw a huge bucket of blood to Boris' slick Halloween decorations. As Boris runs up to stop Dante, the latter splashes the blood on the former instead, and declares a war. Spectators begin to crowd as the two fight, placing bets and egging them on until the police come. Boris charges Dante towards a sharp piece of standing wood, killing both of them instantly, shocking the crowd. =Friday the 31st= :Written by Mike Mendez and Dave Parker, directed by Mike Mendez. A deformed serial killer (Nick Principe) who resembles Jason Voorhees hunts a girl dressed as Dorothy for Halloween (Amanda Moyer). The girl runs to a barn where she discovers several of the killer's victims, among them her friend, Casey. The killer hunts her down to the barn, and when she manages to escape and flee, he kills her by throwing a spear through her chest. As the killer celebrates the slaying, a UFO beams down a small alien that tries to trick-or-treat. Unable to give any candy, the killer proceeds to stomp over the tiny alien, seemingly crushing him, but the alien instead turns into goo and possesses the victim's body, chasing the panicked killer into his barn. The possessed girl and the killer then proceed to attack each other with sharp objects, which eventually concludes with both of them decapitating each other. The alien then leaves the girl's severed head to teleport back to his spaceship, taking the killer's head with him as his 'treat'. =The Ransom of Rusty Rex= :Written and directed by Ryan Schifrin. When they spot millionaire Jebediah Rex (John Landis) letting his son Rusty (Ben Woolf) out for trick-or-treating, former bank robbers Hank (Sam Witwer) and Dutch (Jose Pablo Cantillo) set out their plan to kidnap the millionaire's son. After succeeding doing so, the kidnappers tied up a still-masked Rusty into a chair and call his father. However, the father seems overjoyed that his 'son' has been kidnapped, tells them that they made a terrible mistake, and promptly hangs up the phone. Hank calls him one more time to discuss the ransom, but the father coldly tells them they can have his son. Exasperated, the kidnappers find out that the son is actually a deformed cat-like monster that clings to the people near him. After a vicious fight, they try to sink him in the river, but he comes back to their lair. Hank calls Jebediah once more, only to be told that Rusty has been holding Jebediah and his wife hostage for five years as he would not leave them since he came to them for Trick or Treat, and thanked the kidnappers for taking him away from them. He also warns to never forget to feed Rusty. Hank and Dutch once again tied Rusty, delivered him to Jebediah's door, and set him on fire, but as Hank comes back from buying food, Rusty, who has gotten hungry, has eaten Dutch's entire body up to his head. The segment ends with Hank screaming. =Bad Seed= :Written and directed by Neil Marshall. After a man has his head bitten off by a massive pumpkin he has just carved, Detective McNally (Kristina Klebe) investigates the crime scene. At first she refuses to believe the description of the victim's wife, but after the forensics team member, Bob, confirms the killer was indeed a carved pumpkin, she works to put a stop to it. The pumpkin proceeds to eat a trick-or-treating child and terrorizes the neighborhood, which has already suffered from the events portrayed earlier in the film. McNally manages to track the killer pumpkin down to a backyard, where it attacks her; though she initially runs out of bullets, Bob appears with a shotgun, and she is able to destroy it. Among the broken pieces of pumpkin, she finds a sticker from a company called Clover Corp. advertising the pumpkin as a 100% organic super-pumpkin. McNally and Bob visit the Clover Corp. headquarters and discover thousands of genetically- modified pumpkins, all potentially dangerous, waiting to be sold.

The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on October 16, 2015. Reception Reception for Tales of Halloween has been positive, with Rotten Tomatoes certifying it \\"fresh\\" with a 79% rating. The site's consensus reads, \\"Tales Of Halloween boasts a number of fun scares and is overall more consistent than many horror anthology films, even it isn't quite as dark or nasty as the classics of the genre.\\" Michael Gingold, writing for Fangoria, called it \\"Well-produced on its modest budget\\" and gave it three and a half out of four skulls. Kalyn Corrigan of Bloody Disgusting called it \\"a fun, exuberant addition to the subgenre of horror anthology films.\\" Katie Rife of The A.V. Club gave it a \\"B\\" saying the film \\"might make it a new annual tradition in horror-loving households.\\" Rob Hunter of Film School Rejects wrote \\"Tales of Halloween is good fun, but it‚Äôs difficult not to wish that more of the stories had aimed for darker, more terrifying and affecting goals. Still, the EC Comics attitude finds a new home with Carolyn and her crew, and with any luck the film will spawn a new Halloween tradition of fun, gory, spooky anthology films highlighted by short, messy bursts of genre talent.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety gave the film a mixed review, calling the segments \\"polished enough but utterly routine\\" and saying \\"Even the best of these, however, are held back by brevity from developing silly ideas into anything truly memorable.\\" References External links * Category:2015 films Category:2015 comedy horror films Category:American films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American ghost films Category:American monster movies Category:American slasher films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:Demons in film Category:The Devil in fiction Category:English- language films Category:Films about bullying Category:Films about extraterrestrial life Category:Films about psychopaths Category:Films based on Hansel and Gretel Category:American horror anthology films Category:Mariticide in fiction Category:Matricide in fiction Category:Patricide in fiction Category:American serial killer films Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Halloween horror films ","title":"Tales of Halloween"},{"id":"45610433","text":"Helen Kerly's helmet from World War II Roald Dahl's RAF flying helmet from World War II, fitted with oxygen mask and communications equipment During the first years of aviation pilots started wearing leather flying helmets as a form of protection from the cold and the noise of aircraft engines. Leather was becoming a popular choice for protective gear with the rise of motor sport and aviation at the start of the 1900s. It has many advantages that made it the ideal material for flying helmets. It is warm, durable, impermeable to liquids therefore waterproof, flexible and can be cut to curve around the head. It is wind-proof and has the great advantage of not accumulating dust. It was also found that leather helmets offered a level of protection against fire. Perhaps the most iconic design of early leather flying helmet was known as the Type B helmet. This was designed to accommodate earphones in pockets in the ear-flaps and was easy to wear with oxygen masks and goggles. A detailed description of a typical Type B helmet can be found on the website of The Imperial War Museum (London, England). It is made from six vertical panels which meet at a central ridge panel running from front to back. There is a rectangular horizontal panel which goes across the forehead and it includes padded leather oval housings at the ears. The chinstrap, also made of leather, is stitched to the right side and buckled to a small strap on the left. The brown leather of the helmet is lined with buff-coloured chamois and has a rectangular length of brown-coloured material sewn to the inside of the forehead. A particularly fine example of a Type B flying helmet can be found in the Thinktank, The Science museum for Birmingham, England. That helmet belonged to a female pilot, Helen Kerly who was a Spitfire delivery pilot during the Second World War. The Type B flying helmet was designed to accommodate the addition of earphones for radio communication, but unlike later models did not include integrated wiring. Similarly, the helmet was styled to be comfortably worn with an oxygen mask and separate goggles to protect the eyes. Protection from head injuries was not considered, the leather is soft and flexible not hard to withstand blows. There were many female pilots in the early part of the 1900s who wore the same design of protective clothing, including helmets, as their male counterparts. The leather helmets and jackets, the goggles and boots allowed the women to function as pilots in the same terms as men. Manufactures of early flying helmets were Alfred Dunhill Ltd., of England, Roold in Paris and Gammages of Holborn.

Biography  Laskey was born in San Luis Obispo, California in 1975. She graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1997 with a degree in Art History. She received a B.F.A. from the California College of Arts and Crafts in 1999 and an M.F.A. from the California College of the Arts in 2005. As of 2015, Laskey lives in San Francisco.  Work  Although Laskey has often grouped with fiber artists,her real contribution has been to the discussion of painting. Laskey came to weaving through painting. Beginning by making her own paints and weaving her own canvases, she started to paint individual threads that incorporate her designs into the canvas itself, calculating for color fades and interactions. Laskey's weaving/paintings are created painstakingly, taking months to weave after first completing a planning stage of preliminary graph drawings. Laskey maintains rigorous control over the elements of her work--although she follows Minimalist methods of precise and orderly construction, her work is also predicated on the craft ethos of Modernist weavers like Anni Albers and Gunta St√∂lzl.  Awards and honors  In 2016 Laskey won the Artadia Award. In 2010, she won the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's SECA Art Award.

There exists a 1340 design by Agostino di Giovanni. Completion of the palace took nearly a century. In 1466, the owner, Tofo di Cecco Sansedoni, was requested to complete the Piazza facade, and fill in many of the window arches.

The offensive started with General Offensive of 1 March 1949 and the Siege of Surakarta. Each proved a major boast for the moral of the TNI despite major defeats in both actions. General Offensive of 1 March 1949 In early 1949, Hamengkubuwono IX conceived the idea of a major offensive to be launched against Yogyakarta and the Dutch troops occupying it. The purpose of this offensive was to show to the world that Indonesia still existed and that it was not ready to surrender. The Offensive caught the Dutch by surprise. For his part, Hamengkubuwono IX allowed his palace to be used as a hide out for the troops. For 6 hours, the Indonesian troops had control of Yogyakarta before finally retreating. The offensive was a moral success, inspiring demoralized troops all around Indonesia. It failed in its attempt to show the world that the Indonesian army still existed. Not much attention was paid to it by the United Nations. Surakarta insurgency The Tentara Republik Indonesia made an attempt before the armistice, to get hands on Surakarta in Central Java and succeeded in many places to infiltrate the city. 325 men of the RST were hastily flown in to expel the TNI from Surakarta. In a few days time the insurgency was carried out. Approximately 400 members of the TNI were killed, while the RST numbered only three wounded. It can not be entirely ruled out that a number of civilian casualties have been counted among the losses of the TNI. Aftermath This last battle of the RST showed again the qualitative superiority of the KST/RST on the Indonesian nationalist fighters. The leader of the raid on Surakarta on August 7, 1949 was Lieutenant Colonel Slamet Riyadi. To commemorate this event, the main street of the city of Surakarta was renamed \\"Brigadier General Slamet Riyadi Street\\".

It is a long pedestrian staircase that extends from Edward and Turbot Streets up to Wickham Terrace. The name is a reference to the Biblical stairway ascending to Heaven. Geography Jacob's Ladder, King Edward Park, Brisbane, March 1915 Jacob's Ladder to the left of Trades Hall, circa 1928 Jacob's Ladder is within King Edward Park and provides the shortest but steepest pedestrian access from the Brisbane central business district to Spring Hill on the escarpment above. It is on the boundary of the park separating it from an office tower on the north-east, formerly the site of the Brisbane Trades Hall (1891‚Äì1984). History In 1895, Alderman James Hipwood made reference to: :That concrete water-tables and asphalt footpaths be laid on foot-path through reserve, leading from Wickham terrace to Turbot street; This reserve owned by the State Government was one of several parcels of parkland including the Observatory reserve, and municipally-owned Wickham Park. It is unclear when Jacob's Ladder was recognised by that name, but there are references to its existence by that name from as early as 1897. This may have been about the same time as Turbot Street was extended from Albert Street east to Edward Street, as well as the relatively new Central railway station. The adjoining park reserve was known for its amorous couples by 1904. Poinsettias were to be planted alongside the steps in 1914 so the steps would 'be made bright'. An unsuccessful attempt was made between 1918 and 1920, led by the Minister for Lands Harry Coyne but opposed by the municipal council, to resume the land so it may be added to the adjoining Trades Hall site. April 1922 saw representations to fully restore access to the steps following the trades hall construction. In 1920, the concrete steps were built, with earlier photographs showing a steep pathway without steps. As part of demonstrating reliability captured by photograph by a newspaper, the steep stairs were driven the length by a Whippet motor car in March 1928. The 1930 request for a hill-climb test for a truck was rejected by the municipal council. An unattended car, from a Wickham Terrace surgery, careered down the stairs and down Edward Street towards Adelaide Street, resulting in the injury to one pedestrian. In 1936, municipal parkland resumption was being considered between Albert and Edward Streets along Turbot Street, as far as Jacob's Ladder, for a new dental hospital, public library, and art gallery.

The temple was preceded by a cult site which dated back to the 8th century BC, with an altar discovered in excavation at the beginning of the twentieth century, and by an earlier temple from the middle of the sixth century BC.  History  Columns of the temple within the Duomo = Gelo and the construction of the temple = Right where the temple of Athena is located, there once was another, more archaic temple, still in the doric style, as archaeological discoveries during the excavations of 1912 and 1917 confirmed. They included architectural elements, terracottas and part of an altar, datable to the sixth century BC. The Athenaion was built, according to the literary sources, by Gelo, the first tyrant of Syracuse, who came from the Deinomenid dynasty of Gela, after his victory over the Carthaginians at the Battle of Himera in 480 BC. The similarity of the Temple of Athena to the Temple of Victory at Himera has convinced archaeologists that both the date and circumstances of the temples construction given in the literary sources is correct. The temple was dedicated to Athena, goddess of wisdom and warfare, as testified by Cicero in his Verrine OrationsCicero, Verrine II.4.122 and also by Plato and Athenaeus. Cicero provides extensive details in his speech, claiming that the temple had been respected by the conqueror of Syracuse, Marcus Claudius Marcellus and had only been plundered by the praetor Verres.Aedis Minervae est in Insula, de qua ante dixi; quam Marcellus non attigit, quam plenam atque ornatam reliquit; quae ab isto sic spoliata atque direpta est, non ut ab hoste aliquo, qui tamen in bello religionem et consuetudinis iura retineret, sed ut a barbaris praedonibus vexata esse videatur. Pugna erat equestris Agathocli regis in tabulis picta; iis autem tabulis interiores templi parietes vestiebantur. Nihil erat ea pictura nobilius, nihil Syracusis quod magis videndum putaretur. Has tabulas M. Marcellus, cum omnia victoria illa sua profana fecisset, tamen religione impeditus non attigit; iste, cum illa iam propter diuturnam pacem fidelitatemque populi Syracusani sacra religiosaque accepisset, omnes eas tabulas abstulit, parietes, quorum ornatus tot saecula manserant, tot bella effugerant, nudos ac deformatos reliquit. There is a temple of Minerva on the island, which I mentioned before, which Marcellus did not touch, which remained complete and decorated, which has been despoiled and ruined by that man [Verres]. It would seem to have been wrecked not by an enemy general (on the contrary, the general maintained religion and the customary law) but by barbarian hordes. There was a painting on panels of a battle, with King Agathokles on horseback; the inside walls of the temple were covered with these panels. Nothing was more famous than this picture, nothing in Syracuse was considered more worthwhile to see. Although he had made all things un-sacred by his victory, Marcus Marcellus did not touch these panels, held back by his own religious feeling. But although they had regained their sacred and religious character thanks to the enduring submission and loyalty of the Syracusan people, that man [Verres] removed all the panels and left the walls which they had decorated for so many centuries, which had escaped so many wars, naked and disfigured.  Structure of the Temple  Plan of the Temple of Athena of Syracuse The Athenaio was a peripteral temple with six columns on the short sides and fourteen on the long sides, fitting the proportions of the classical canon developed on the Greek mainland. On the front, the intercolumniation at either edge was reduced, the canonical solution to issues of perspective. In total, the building was 22 metres wide and 55 metres long. The peristyle surrounded a cella with a pronaos and an opisthodomos, both featuring two columns in antis. The temple was converted into a Christian place of worship and parts of it are still found incorporated into the walls of the Cathedral of Syracuse. On the left side of the Duomo, some columns of local limestone and the stylobate on which they stood remain visible. Other remains (marble tiles and water spouts shaped like lion's heads) are preserved in the Museo Archeologico Regionale Paolo Orsi. Inside the Duomo, 9 further columns from the right side of the peripteros are clearly visible, with a pronounced entasis, as well as the two from the front of the cella.  Architecture and pictorial decoration  Reconstruction of the front of the Temple of Athena with the gilded shield Part of the pediment of the Temple of Athena This is the description which Tommaso Fazello gave of the gilt shield located in the pediment of the Syracusan temple. From Cicero, who lists the decorations pillaged by Verres, we know that it was decorated with ivory, golden bosses on the doors, and a series of painted panels depicting a cavalry battle between Agathokles and the Carthaginians, as well as 27 portraits of the city's tyrants.

It was followed by a sequel, The Methods of Lady Walderhurst, but both have been subsequently published together, either under the original name The Making of a Marchioness or as Emily Fox-Seton. The collected version was republished by Persephone Books. It was made into a BBC Radio 4 Classic Serial in 2007.  Plot summary  Emily Fox-Seton is a young woman of good birth but no money who works as a companion and assistant for various members of the upper class. Her chief employer is Lady Maria Bayne, who is both very selfish and very funny, although she does come to care for Emily. In a \\"Cinderella-like\\" ending, Emily eventually marries a much older man, James, the Marquess of Walderhurst, thus herself becoming a marchioness. In the sequel, originally The Methods of Lady Walderhurst, Emily has Walderhurst's child, and his former heir, Alec Osborn, attempts to regain what he sees as his birthright.  Major themes  The Persephone Forum compares Emily Fox-Seton with Miss Pettigrew in Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day. Both are well-born women with little money in era when such women had few job opportunities. The book also reflects the casual racism of its day. The Persephone Forum comments: \\"The language of 1900 may offend now, but that was how it was, and Mrs Cupp‚Äôs ill-judged present of a little brown Testament to Hester Osborn‚Äôs Indian maid is firmly mocked.\\"  Publication history  The Making of a Marchioness and The Methods of Lady Walderhurst were originally published in 1901, while Burnett was also working on a longer and more complicated book, The Shuttle. Both books were republished in 2007 as The Making of a Marchioness by Persephone Books.  Adaptations  In 2007, The Making of a Marchioness was made into a BBC Radio 4 Classic Serial, dramatised by Michelene Wandor, directed by Chris Wallis, and featuring Charles Dance as Lord Walderhurst, Miriam Margolyes as Lady Walderhurst, Lucy Briers as Emily, Joanna David as the narrator, Anjali Jay as Hester, and Amara Karan as Lady Agatha. The Radio Times called the radio adaptation a \\"delightful and occasionally dark romance.\\" In 2012, the television film The Making of a Lady was created based on the book. Kate Brooke wrote the screenplay adaptation, and Richard Curson Smith directed. Lydia Wilson starred as Emily, Linus Roache as Lord James Walderhurst, Joanna Lumley as Lady Maria Byrne, and James D‚ÄôArcy as Captain Alec Osborn. The film premiered in 2012 on ITV in Britain, and was subsequently broadcast on PBS in the United States in 2014.

Pederson is known for her use of ordinary household, construction, and building materials to explore sculptural concepts of weight, tension, balance, and permanence. She is the recipient of a 2006 SECA Art Award. Pederson splits her time between San Francisco and Berlin. Early life and education Pederson was born in 1976 in Stuart, Florida. She has an M.F.A. in painting and drawing from the California College of the Arts, a B.F.A. in printing, painting, and drawing, along with a minor in architecture, from Carnegie Mellon University, and studied at L'√âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. Work Pederson uses everyday materials as the basis of her work, with an emphasis on the material of construction. She sources these materials from remnants of destruction, such as scrap heaps, as well as hardware stores and other retailers. Her sculptures have included cinderblocks, plywood, cellophane, fabric, tulle, wire, sand, glitter, and paint. The materials are often presented in a nearly-raw state, with light embellishment using ephemera such as gilding, tulle, and glitter.  Critical reception  Pederson began showing during her time at the California College of the Arts, appearing with regularity in gallery exhibitions at the institution and in galleries around the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2006, two years after completing her M.F.A. program, Pederson was announced as one of four recipients of the SECA Art Award from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In 2008, Pederson's work was included in the Whitney Biennial, at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. Both the SECA Award and the Whitney Biennial focus on emerging, lesser known contemporary artists; the Biennial has been described as \\"one of the most important surveys of the state of contemporary art in the United States.\\" In 2008, art critic Glen Helfand included Pederson's exhibition \\"Unlet Me Go\\" as a selection in his top ten \\"exhibitions, events, and films\\" from 2007 based on \\"joy, originality, and serious subtext.\\" Her work has been described by curators as possessing a graceful use of balance, deliberation, and incongruity, while marrying elements in unexpected or impracticable ways. She is noted for \\"restrained gestures,\\" \\"contemplative\\" investigations of energy and time. Critics have described her work as \\"sparse [and] smart,\\" having a \\"savvy humbleness,\\" and \\"slight in a cerebral way,\\" while citing her \\"aesthetic sensibility and formal courage\\" and ability to produce a \\"radical evolution of simple things.\\" Critics have suggested Pederson's work has antecedents in and influences from sculptors such Richard Serra, Richard Tuttle, and Anselm Reyle.

Using white paint and applying patterns of highly reflective mica, which can also make light look very white, Diaz painted the window-facing wall of the bridge to take advantage of the light flooding into the glass-walled corridor. Thinking about how the viewer's perception of the piece changes as he or she walks across the bridge, Castrillo Diaz also felt ‚Äúit needed to flow like water.\\" In this mural, the white palette and reflectivity of the mica are both elements of the design; however, distinctions in white that can be seen from one angle may not be visible at another angle.

It aired on April 12, 2015. The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Michael Slovis, his directorial debut for the series. Prior to airing, this episode along with the remaining first four episodes of the season were leaked online. This episode marks the final appearance of Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) and Ciar√°n Hinds (Mance Rayder). Plot =Prologue, in the Westerlands= A young Cersei meets Maggy the Frog, a fortune teller. Cersei demands to know whether or not she will marry Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and have his children. Maggy informs her that she will instead be wed to \\"the king\\" (Robert Baratheon) and she will have three children, who will wear golden crowns, but also golden shrouds (meaning they will all die), and that another queen, younger and more beautiful than Cersei, will cast her down. =In King's Landing= Cersei arrives at the Sept of Baelor to pay her respects to Tywin and chastises Jaime for freeing Tyrion. At the wake, Cersei is approached by Lancel, who has become a member of the Sparrows, a religious group devoted to the Faith of the Seven. Lancel apologizes to Cersei for their affair and for getting Robert drunk before the hunt in which he was mortally wounded, but Cersei feigns ignorance. Margaery catches Loras abed with Olyvar and warns him to be more discreet. Loras tells Margaery that no one can force Cersei to marry him now that Tywin is dead, but Cersei will remain in King's Landing instead of going to Highgarden. Margaery hints that she has a solution. =In Pentos= Tyrion and Varys arrive in Pentos. Varys tells Tyrion that he and Illyrio Mopatis worked in secret to make Daenerys the new ruler of Westeros and convinces him to travel to Meereen to meet her. =In Meereen= One of the Unsullied is killed by a member of Sons of the Harpy, an insurgency of former masters. Daenerys orders Grey Worm to find the killer. Daario and Hizdahr return from Yunkai and tell Daenerys that the Wise Masters will turn over power to a council of former slaves and former masters, in return for the reopening of the fighting pits, where slaves fought to the death. Daenerys refuses, despite Daario's insistence that she reconsider. Daenerys visits her dragons under the Great Pyramid but leaves when they try to attack her. =In the Vale= Lord Yohn Royce agrees to take Robin Arryn as his ward. Petyr tells Royce that he and Sansa will travel to the Fingers, but they instead head west. Meanwhile, Brienne and Podrick ponder their next move, unaware that Sansa's carriage has just passed them. =At the Wall= Stannis wants Jon to persuade Mance to bend the knee and have the wildlings fight for Stannis so that he can take back the North from Roose Bolton. Mance refuses and is sentenced to burn at the stake. Out of mercy, Jon shoots him dead before he succumbs to the fire.  Production  = Writing = The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. This episode was written by executive producers David Benioff and D. B.

The episode marked the first usage of flashbacks, a trope previously avoided to prevent the story from becoming more convoluted than it already was. Flashbacks are also avoided because the writers do not wish to take away from the current plot, as it allows viewers to see the reaction of characters in the present, something that would not be as easy with flashbacks. = Casting = With this episode, Michiel Huisman (Daario Naharis), Nathalie Emmanuel (Missandei) and Dean- Charles Chapman (Tommen Baratheon) are promoted to series regulars. Ian Gelder (Kevan Lannister) and Eugene Simon (Lancel Lannister) make return appearances after an absence of several years (since the second season).

In the UK, on Sky Atlantic, the episode broke the record for the highest viewer rating on the channel, with 2.63 million tuning in, It also received 0.145 million timeshift viewers. According to HBO, total viewership rose to 18 million over the next three weeks as more people watched the episode through other venues, such as streaming. = Critical reception = Reception to the episode has been positive. Based on 48 critic reviews, the episode received a 96% score from Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 7.82 out of 10, the site's consensus calling it a \\"solid season premiere\\" and saying it \\"ratchets up the anticipation for inevitable bloodshed while deepening focus on characters and locales.\\" BBC's Keith Uhlich praised the episode and the episode's \\"ostensible lead\\", Peter Dinklage, proclaiming that in the first season the character \\"provided comic relief\\" but has since \\"become more central to the narrative\\". He concluded stating \\"it's a show as capable of portraying one character's specific longings as it is widening its gaze to take in a soul-stirring view. And it always leaves the viewer wondering what other lands and adventures might lie over the horizon.\\" Matt Fowler from IGN gave it a mostly positive review stating \\"[the series] is off to a good start with this solid, though not stunning, premiere\\". He criticized the episode's character development saying \\"it's part of the show's harrowing design to constantly thin the herd [but] we do reach a point where we run low on character to really care about/connect with/invest in.\\" He gave the episode a rating of 8.2 out of 10. The A.V. Club published two reviews, as they have done for each prior episode. Erik Adams wrote the review for people who have not read the novels, and gave the episode a \\"B\\" rating. Myles McNutt, who reviewed the episode for people who have read the novels, positively reviewed the episode although he criticized the episode's overuse of filming locations stating \\"you wish you could spend more than three scenes in a given location\\". However, he expressed his excitement towards the series \\"offering new perspectives on those events offered by a less rigid approach to characterization, and creating new material out of whole cloth to push the story and its characters forward.\\" Charlotte Runcie of The Daily Telegraph gave it a four out of five star review and stated \\"the beginning of season five was a promise of more greatness to come\\" concluding that \\"this wasn't the most dramatic episode so far, but the acting and writing were sharper than ever.\\"  References   External links  * at HBO.com * * Category:2015 American television episodes Category:Game of Thrones (season 5) episodes Category:Television episodes written by David Benioff and D.B.

The episode received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series at the 67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. The episode was met with generally positive reviews, but received heavy criticism for the decision to kill off Ser Barristan Selmy, who in the novels is still alive and is a major supporting character.

Production =Writing= This episode was the first to be written by staff writer Dave Hill, who previously worked as an assistant to showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss and contains content from two of George R. R. Martin's novels, A Feast for Crows, Cersei IV and Cersei VI, and A Dance with Dragons, chapters Tyrion VII, Jon II, with elements of Daenerys II and the Epilogue. Like the season's earlier episodes, \\"Sons of the Harpy\\" deviated from George Martin's novels in several places. Hilary Busis and Darren Francich of Entertainment Weekly continued their approval of the decision to consolidate the Sansa and Arya impostor storylines. The scene between Stannis and Shireen was written specifically for the episode. Both Sarah Moran of Screen Rant and Matt Fowler of IGN agreed that interacting with a more visible and vocal Shireen gives Stannis's character some emotional depth, with Moran adding that the change \\"gives us insight into characters we already know.\\" Moran also approved of the streamlined story and cast, noting that the show has \\"whittled down Oberyn Martell's bastard daughters from eight to three\\" and giving Arianne Martell's plotline to the already-established Ellaria Sand. David Crow of Den of Geek expressed reservations about the scene in which Grey Worm and Barristan Selmy are wounded and left for dead, referring to it as \\"vainglorious and artificial,\\" but he also said, \\"Bringing Bronn back into the fold was one of Game of Thrones more astute changes from the books as he offers a great counterbalance to either Lannister brother.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN, however, found the acceleration of the Faith Militant storyline jarring, \\"like a time-crunch collage.\\" =Casting= The episode has the introduction of new recurring cast members Keisha Castle-Hughes, Jessica Henwick and Rosabell Laurenti Sellers, who play the Sand Snakes: Obara, Nymeria and Tyene Sand.

Ranking amongst the top 15 air carriers worldwide in terms of the scale of revenue-passengers-kilometres, and 10th in the world for the volume of international passengers carried, Singapore Airlines is one of the largest airline businesses in Asia. Origin An Airspeed Consul (VR- SCD) ‚Äì the first aircraft type operated by Malayan Airways, which was the forerunner of Singapore Airlines Singapore Airlines began with the incorporation of Malayan Airways Limited (MAL) on 1 May 1947, by the Ocean Steamship Company of Liverpool, the Straits Steamship Company of Singapore and Imperial Airways. The airline's first flight was a chartered flight from the British Straits Settlement of Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on 2 April 1947 using an Airspeed Consul twin-engined aircraft. Regular weekly scheduled flights quickly followed from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh and Penang from 1 May 1947 with the same aircraft type. The airline continued to expand during the rest of the 1940s and 1950s, as other British Commonwealth airlines (such as BOAC and Qantas Empire Airways) provided technical assistance, as well as assistance in joining IATA. By 1955, Malayan Airways' fleet had grown to include a large number of Douglas DC-3s, and went public in 1957. Other aircraft operated in the first two decades included the Douglas DC-4 Skymaster, the Vickers Viscount, the Lockheed 1049 Super Constellation, the Bristol Britannia, the de Havilland Comet 4 and the Fokker F27. When Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the airline's name was changed, from \\"Malayan Airways\\" to \\"Malaysian Airways\\". MAL also took over Borneo Airways. In 1966, following Singapore's separation from the federation, the airline's name was changed again, to Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA). The next year saw a rapid expansion in the airline's fleet and route, including the purchase of MSA's first Boeing aircraft, the Boeing 707s, as well the completion of a new high-rise headquarters in Singapore. Boeing 737s were added to the fleet soon after. Incorporation and growth An MSA Boeing 707 at Z√ºrich-Kloten Airport. (1972) MSA ceased operations in 1972, when Singapore wanted to develop its international routes but Malaysia wanted to develop its domestic routes before moving on to international routes, resulting in the formation of Singapore Airlines and Malaysian Airlines System. Hence, Singapore Airlines kept all of MSA's Boeing 707s and 737s, retained the international routes out of Singapore as well as the existing corporate headquarters in the city, with J.Y. Pillay, former joint chief of MSA as its first chairperson. Female flight attendants continued to wear the sarong kebaya uniform, which had been first introduced in 1968. A local start- up advertising company, Batey Ads was given the right to market the airline, eventually selecting the sarong and kebaya-clad air stewardesses as an icon for the airline and calling them Singapore Girls. DC-10-30 at Zurich in 1979. SIA expanded almost overnight after the split from MSA in 1972, adding cities in the Indian subcontinent and Asia, and adding Boeing 727s, Boeing 747s and Douglas DC-10s to its fleet. The 1st two 747s arrived in the summer of 1973 and were deployed on the lucrative Singapore-Hong Kong-Taipei-Tokyo (Haneda Airport) run. As additional 747-200s arrived they were placed on routes to London, Paris and Rome, Australia and the long cherished USA with service to Los Angeles. The DC-10s lasted only a couple of years in the SIA fleet. In 1977, Singapore Airlines took delivery of its first Boeing 727-200 Advanced, flying it on its inaugural service from Singapore to Manila. The B727 was Singapore Airlines' successor to the B737-100s that it had inherited from MSA. Concorde in Singapore Airlines livery at Heathrow in 1979. In 1977 British Airways and Singapore Airlines shared a Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain. The aircraft, BA's Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery on the port side and British Airways livery on the starboard side. The service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government; it could only be reinstated on a new route by passing Malaysian airspace in 1979. A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace so the route was discontinued in 1980. A Singapore Airlines Airbus A300 seen at the Farnborough Airshow in 1980. The 1980s saw expanded services to United States, Canada, and additional European cities with Madrid becoming the first Hispanic city to be served by SIA. Boeing 747-300s were leased and introduced into the SIA fleet in the early 1980s and named 'Big Tops'. The 747-300s replaced the 747-200s on all trans-pacific routes as well as the prime European destinations. Again a short-term affair was begun with a few Boeing 757s later followed by the addition of Airbus A310s and Airbus A300s The A310s became the Asian regional workhorse of the fleet, with the small A310-200 fleet serving until the late 1990s, and the much larger A310-300 fleet serving into the 2000s. In 1989, the first of 50 B747-400s was added to the fleet. The Airbus A340-300s augmented the 747-400s on long-range routes to Spain, Zurich, Copenhagen, San Francisco and cities not suitable for 747 service. Services extended to southern Africa in the 1990s when the airline began flights to Johannesburg in South Africa; Cape Town and Durban were later added. The 1990s also saw the opening of Terminal 2 in Changi Airport in 1991; all flight operations later moved to the new terminal. Police raided SIA's offices in Germany for offering tickets that were priced at such a low level they were allegedly illegal. The airline called a press conference condemning the police, which led to the raid being stopped. In 2003 SIA obtained 5 long range Airbus A340-500 aircraft and started the two longest nonstop flights in aviation history, Singapore ‚Äì Newark and Singapore ‚Äì Los Angeles. In winter 2007 SIA saw its first double decker Airbus A380-800 join the fleet. Today Singapore Airlines is the world's 2nd largest operator of the type after Emirates of the UAE. SIA employs the A380 on routes to London, Zurich, Frankfurt, Paris, Mumbai, Beijing, Sydney, Melbourne, Los Angeles and New York. SIA is also currently a far reaching global carrier and is a cornerstone member of Star Alliance. Modern history A Singapore Airlines Boeing 747-400, dubbed Megatop, at Auckland Airport, New Zealand. The Megatop was the flagship of the airline from 1989 until the introduction of the Airbus A380 in October 2007 In 2004, SIA began non-stop trans-Pacific flights from Singapore to Los Angeles and Newark, utilising the Airbus A340-500. These flights marked the first non-stop air services between Singapore and the USA. The Singapore to Newark flight held the record for the longest scheduled commercial flight, with a flying time of about 18 hours each way. Singapore Airlines has converted its five Airbus A340-500 aircraft from a 64 Business Class/117 Premium Economy Class configuration to a 100-seat all- Business Class configuration for its routes to Newark and Los Angeles. In January 2009, SIA took the decision to stop its thrice weekly flights to Vancouver, Canada as the global financial crisis had sapped demand on the route. The last flight was scheduled to take place on 25 April 2009. At a Cabinet meeting on 22 February 2006, the Government of Australia decided not to grant fifth freedom rights to Singapore Airlines on flights from Australia to the United States. Singapore Airlines had argued that transpacific flights from Australia suffered from under-capacity, leading to limited competition and relatively high air fares. The move was seen as a measure taken to protect Qantas from increased competition. SIA had encountered such protectionist measures in the past when SIA was shut out from the Toronto market after complaints from Air Canada, and was forced to stop flying Boeing 747-400s into Jakarta in the wake of protests from Garuda Indonesia when it could not use similar equipment to compete. Singapore Airlines, along with Star Alliance partner South African Airways, was fined 25 million South African Rand (S$4.1 million) as an administrative penalty to partially settle a price-fixing investigation against the airline by the South African Competition Commission from 2008 to 2012.SIA agrees to pay S$4.1m penalty for price fixing ‚Äì Channel NewsAsia On 6 April 2012, Singapore Airlines phased out the last 747 in its fleet after 40 years of service. A final round-trip commemorative flight was operated from Singapore to Hong Kong with flight numbers SQ747 and SQ748 respectively. As well as an extended flying time, special meals, performances and inflight celebrations, passengers were given well stocked 747 goody bags. The airline announced that it will end its direct flights from Singapore to both Newark and Los Angeles from 23 November 2013 and 20 October 2013, respectively. The flight to Newark was considered the longest flights in the world. However, Los Angeles will continue to be served from Singapore via Tokyo-Narita. On 13 October 2015, Singapore Airlines announced that it had signed an agreement with Airbus to be the launch customer of a new version of the Airbus A350 XWB called the A350-900ULR (for \\"Ultra Long Range\\"). The flights began on 11 October 2018, with regular daily commercially scheduled flights starting from 18 October 2018. This version of the A350 would have a 2 class layout, with 67 Business Class seats and 94 Premium Economy seats. SIA was the launch customer for the Boeing 787-10, and it was delivered on 25 March 2018. In June 2018, Singapore Airlines and subsidiary Scoot listed Taiwan as part of China under the requirement of Chinese civil aviation administration. = Airbus A380 = Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 taking off at Z√ºrich Airport in March 2011. On 29 September 2000, SIA announced an order for up to 25 Airbus A3XX (as the A380 was known at the time). The US$8.6 billion order comprised a firm order of 10 aircraft, with options on another 15 airframes. The order was confirmed by Singapore Airlines on 12 July 2001. In January 2005, the airline unveiled the slogan \\"First to Fly the A380 ‚Äì Experience the Difference in 2006\\", to promote itself as the first airline to take delivery of the A380-800, which was expected to take place in the second quarter of 2006. In June 2005, Airbus confirmed that due to unforeseen technical problems, initial deliveries of the Airbus A380 would be delayed by up to six months,Airbus confirms super-jumbo delay (BBC News: 1 June 2005) with the first delivery now slated for November 2006. The announcement was met with fury by SIA's chief executive officer, Chew Choon Seng, who threatened to sue Airbus, saying: \\"Airbus took some time to acknowledge the delay in the timetable for the A380's entry into service...I would have expected more sincerity.\\" He further stated that SIA will be turning its attention to Boeing instead, since it would be receiving the Boeing 777-300ER before the A380. Nevertheless, SIA has indicated that this would not affect its promotional campaign. In February 2006, the first A380 in full Singapore Airlines livery was flown to Singapore, where it was displayed at Asian Aerospace 2006. On 14 June 2006, Singapore Airlines placed an initial order for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner as part of its future aircraft expansion. The order consisted of 20 787-9s and rights for 20 more. This order came one day after Airbus announced that the A380 Superjumbo would be delayed by another 6 months. A third delay was announced on 3 October 2006, pushing the initial delivery of the first A380 to October 2007.Airbus Confirms Further A380 Delay and Launches Company Restructuring Plan (Airbus: 3 October 2006) On 25 October 2007, the first commercial A380 service, SQ 380, carried 455 passengers from Singapore to Sydney, touching down in Sydney Airport at 3:24 pm local time, where it received significant attention from the media. The airline donated all revenue generated from the flight to three charities in a ceremony the next day in Sydney. SIA began regular services with the A380 on 28 October 2007. It eventually served London, Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Zurich, Los Angeles as well as New York JFK (via Frankfurt) On 18 February 2009, SIA carried its one millionth A380 passenger. In 2012, SIA announced that it would order a further five more A380 planes (along with an order for 20 Airbus A350 XWB orders). In 2016 the airline confirmed that one A380 would be returned to its leasing company at the end of its 10-year lease in October 2017, with a decision still to be made regarding retention of four additional A380 aircraft whose leases expire between January and June 2018. = Fleet reductions = On 16 February 2009 the airline announced that it would remove 17 aircraft from its operating fleet between April 2009 and March 2010, as part of a cost-saving initiative to help counter falling passenger and cargo demand, having originally planned to phase out only four aircraft. The airline stated that it could not rule out delaying deliveries on aircraft already ordered. = Integration of SilkAir into Singapore Airlines = On 18 May 2018, Singapore Airlines announced that the SilkAir fleet would undergo a major cabin product upgrade from 2020 before being fully merged into the parent company. As part of the merger, SilkAir's website was discontinued and integrated into Singapore Airlines' website on 31 March 2019.https://www.silkair.com/en_UK/en/faqCategory/?category=12509 Cabin upgrades were expected to begin in 2020. On 11 February 2019, Singapore Airlines announced that Thompson Aero Seating had been selected for the upgrade of the SilkAir business class seats, prior to their incorporation into the Singapore Airlines fleet, with work beginning in May 2020. = Formula One = On 15 April 2014 Singapore Airlines announced that it would become the title sponsor for the Singapore Grand Prix, taking over Singtel who had sponsored the event since 2008. In August 2015, the airlines announced that it would extend its sponsorship another 2 years until 2017. In April 2020 SIA announced that they would continue to sponsor the event until 2021. = Response to the COVID-19 pandemic = Like other airlines, Singapore Airlines has been badly hit by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It began to cut capacity in early 2020, it quickly became clear that it would have to scale back flights further. On 17 March 2020, the airline announced that it would suspend more services, leading to a total reduction in the overall capacity of up to 50% of previously schedule flights through to the end of April 2020. On 19 March 2020, airline and the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs agreed to work together to help bring back Singaporeans stuck in the UK as a result of the pandemic. The arrangement made was to prioritise students but also to bring back Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents with the aim for the exercise to be completed by the end of March. On 23 March 2020, Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced that with SilkAir, Singapore Airlines will slash 96% of their capacity. About 138 Singapore Airlines and SilkAir aircraft will be grounded. In addition, on 24 March, SIA announced further measures to help reduce costs while the majority of the fleet is grounded. Captains would be required to take seven days of compulsory no-pay leave per month; first officers would have to take five days; while second officers would take four days. On 25 April, SIA announced that the cancellations would be extended all the way through to the end of June. In the second stimulus package or Resilience Budget on 26 March 2020, DPM Heng Swee Keat announced there would be additional support given to the aviation industry. In it, he announced that firms in the aviation and tourism sectors will receive 75 per cent co-funding per local worker, but would be subject to a monthly wage cap of S$4,600, up until the end of 2020. At the same time, there would be an enhancement to the package that would support the aviation sector more broadly to the tune of S$350 million. This would be used to fund rebates on landing and parking charges, and rental relief for airlines, ground handlers and cargo agents. On the same day it was reported that SIA was considering corporate action with the support of shareholder and government linked corporation, Temasek Holdings. This was confirmed on the 27 March, after the airline announced that it was raising some S$8.8 billion through a mixture of shares and bonds, which would be issued at a discount. As a result, the share ended the day down 43 cents or 6.6% from the end of the previous day's market close. With the significant reduction in flights, SIA agreed to provide some 300 staff to help with possible manpower shortages at hospitals. It was announced that the airline would consolidate all their Changi Airport operations from 1 May 2020 in to Terminal 3. In response to the government mandated \\"circuit breaker\\" from 7 April to 4 May, SIA announced that it would shut down its service centre located at the ION Orchard shopping mall during the lockdown period. On 10 April SIA announced that they would offer a full cash refund on Singapore Airlines, SilkAir and Scoot tickets bought amid the coronavirus outbreak. Alternatively they could choose a credit option for which they would be offered additional flight credits. It was reported on 27 March 2020, SIA received a rescue package of S$19 billion to get over the difficult period. Its major shareholder Temasek Holdings will underwrite the package which contains S$5.3 billion equity and S$9.7 billion convertible note. Singapore's biggest bank DBS will also lend it S$4 billion to help it get over the crisis and position itself for expansion. On 27 April 2020, Singapore Airlines and Scoot confirmed that they will be storing 4 A380s, 3 Boeing 777s and 2 Airbus A320s respectively at Alice Springs. It was mentioned that they will be holding an extraordinary general meeting to discuss about the funding to ensure the survival of the carrier. From 10 May, Singapore Airlines announced that passengers would have to bring their own face mask and wear it throughout the flight as well as observing safe-distancing measures. At the same time, there would no longer be meal services on certain flights - South East Asia and China. They would instead receive a snack pack and bottled water. From 23:59 on 10 May 2020, as directed by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Singapore Airlines and SilkAir both announced saying that passengers are required to wear masks during the entire flight, and will not provide meals and beverage throughout the flight in Singapore to China. On 14 May 2020, Singapore Airlines announced a full year loss for Financial Year 2019/2020 of S$212 million, this was the first loss in its 48 years of operation. On 1 June 2020, Singapore Airlines announced that it intended to restart flights to certain destinations such as Adelaide, Amsterdam, Auckland, Barcelona, Brisbane, Cebu, Christchurch, Copenhagen, Hong Kong, Medan, Melbourne and Osaka, for June and July, subject to regulatory approval. This would bring flight reductions to 94 per cent from the 96 per cent cut reported in March. It also announced that it was introducing additional measures to keep passengers and crew safe. This includes giving passengers a personal protection kit for when they travel, enhancing cleaning of both air planes and lounges. The company announced that, from 11 June 2020, it would allow passengers on Singapore Airlines and SilkAir flying from certain Australian and New Zealand cities in would be allowed to transit through Changi Airport, subject to certain conditions. The cities were Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth (via Scoot) and Sydney in Australia, while Auckland and Christchurch for New Zealand.

On 11 September, it was reported that SIA was considering launching 3 hour flights to no where. However, within a few days, several environmental campaigners argued that is was a bad idea. While Ms Chevon Low, of PM Haze did not want to participate in a direct engagement on the issue, she urged others to get others to the work for them, and \\"get the public to contribute their ideas\\" to stop SIA from flying, despite the dire financial straits the company was in and the large number of job losses expected. On 29 September, the airline announced that it would no longer be launching the flights to no where. Instead of these flights, SIA was offering three different experiences: 1) lunch on board an A380; 2) a tour of SIA's training facilities; 3) and delivery of meals from the first class and business class menus. On 5 October, SIA announced that it was increasing it flights through to year end such that passenger capacity would reach around 15% of its normal capacity.

Two niches have figures of Samson and David. Another room is frescoed with the Story of Camillus. Wall canvases have paintings of Roman history. Other rooms have mythologic frescoes. In 2014, the palace housed offices of the Soprintendenza per i Beni Architettonici e per il Paesaggio per le province di Siena e Grosseto.Beniculturali entry, director Mario Scalini, Coordinator Laura Martini. In the Piazza in front of the palace stands 15th century column surmounted by an iron statue of the Lupa Senese or Sienese Wolf, symbol of the city.

Early life and education  Shows was born in Manteca California, in 1977. Her childhood in Juneau, Alaska had an intense impact on the work she would create as an adult. She received her B.F.A. in 1999 from the San Francisco Art Institute and earned her M.F.A. from the California College of the Arts in 2006.  Work  Leslie Shows' earlier works were mixed-media collages depicting abstracted landscapes. Her more recent paintings, while retaining the use of mixed media, have become more abstracted and focus on mineral textures and geologic features.

Background Creepingbear was born in Lawton, Oklahoma, on 8 September 8, 1947, the son of Rita Littlechief (Kiowa) and Ted Creepingbear (Pawnee‚ÄìArapaho). He began painting in 1974 as a self-taught artist. Education Creepingbear was educated at Carnegie Oklahoma High School and the South Community College in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He also attended Oklahoma State University's School of Technology in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. He was a muralist and painter, who began painting actively and professionally in 1974. He was commissioned to paint a mural in The Kiowa Tribal Complex in Carnegie, Oklahoma along with artists Parker Boyiddle, Jr. and Sherman Chaddlesone. The mural depicts the history of the Kiowa tribe from its original home in the Yellowstone territory to its establishment in the Great Plains region of the United States. Career Creepingbear had a number of occupations including working for an electrical supply company before becoming a full-time painter in 1974. He is considered one of the more important of Oklahoma's traditional artists. His paintings, in oil, watercolor, acrylic and pastel, show a style that is fluid and dramatic and alludes to Native-American culture. He emulated the works of his Kiowa elders as well as American Western artists Frederic Remington and Charles Russell. He worked with gallery owner Doris Littrell who helped promote his work. She provided him with shows, as well as serving as his main gallery and hosted both his first one-man show in 1981 and his final one-man show in 1990.

Pick has exhibited frequently at New Zealand public art galleries; a major survey of her work was organised and toured by the Christchurch Art Gallery in 2009‚Äì10.  Education  Pick graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from Ilam School of Fine Arts, University of Canterbury in 1988. In 1991 she completed a Diploma of Teaching at the Christchurch College of Education.  Career  Early in her career Pick was grouped with other Ilam graduates, such as Tony de Lautour, Shane Cotton, Peter Robinson, Saskia Leek and Bill Hammond under the title of the Pencilcase Painters, known for a painting style that evoked the doodlings of bored teenagers. Pick drew on many sources for the imagery in her painting, from pop culture magazines to pre- Renaissance paintings to naive art. Writing about her work of the 1990s, curator Lara Strongman notes that 'Pick frequently incorporated renditions of talismanic objects from her childhood (red boots, party dresses, paper-bag masks, iron bed-frames) in earlier works, leading her practice to be viewed misleadingly as autobiographical'. Two early residency opportunities (the Olivia Spencer Bower Award in 1994 and the Rita Angus Artist Residency in 1995) enabled Pick to take time away from secondary school art teaching and concentrate on painting full-time. During both residencies she was able to produce bodies of work that 'built upon her past style and explored new challenges'. Curator Felicity Milburn has identified several stages to Pick's artistic development: > Pick's early work employed imagery sourced from significant moments in Art > History, making particular use of the Gothic emblems of the Medieval period. > By 1994, however, she had developed her own distinctive and captivatingly > personal iconography. Works from this period have been described as > 'dreamscapes' in which symbolic images from Pick's memory (beds, dresses, > pincushions, colanders) float surreally across rich surfaces. These > strangely dislocated objects were often domestic in nature, indicating the > special significance memory can inject into otherwise everyday objects. > Shortly after making those works, Pick travelled to Europe, where she found > she was again overwhelmed by the immense history of European art. When she > returned to New Zealand, she began painting in a very different way, using > figures and objects sculpted in the round with greens, blues, warm pinks and > browns to explore a new-found sensuality and flesh out a gentle, often naive > eroticism. Milburn notes that ‚Äòthe spidery drawing she scratches into the viscous surface of her canvases‚Äô remained a constant in Pick‚Äôs painting over this time. In 1997‚Äì1998 Pick lectured in painting at the Elam School of Fine Arts In 1999 she was awarded the University of Otago's Frances Hodgkins Fellowship and on completing the residency remained in Dunedin until 2007. In 2007 art critic Mark Amery noted that 'Even in this day and age Pick's intense focus on the female figure in a psychological landscape makes her something of a lone figure'. He continued: > If other contemporary artists unconsciously stay clear of the depiction of > women for the fact that its overexploited, it leaves it to Pick to breed > together imagery from fashion and art history in a hothouse, dreamily > upsetting mythologies still inherent in our treatment of the female figure. In 2009 Pick collaborated with writer Jo Randerson on the illustrated book Through The Door, published by Wedge Press. In the same year her work was the subject of a major survey exhibition S√©raphine Pick: Tell Me More at Christchurch Art Gallery, curated by Felicity Milburn and toured to City Gallery Wellington and the Dunedin Public Art Gallery. The exhibition was accompanied by a publication with essays by Milburn, Lara Strongman, Andrew Paul Wood and others. Reviewer James Dignan, writing of Tell Me More in the Otago Daily Times in 2010, described the development of Pick's work as moving > [...] from ghostlike scratches on canvas to full-blooded figurative darkness > [showing influences] from Bosch through Redon to Leonor Fini. Through it > all, the subterranean undercurrents are a dominant thread, notably in the > recent large crowd scenes and solitary figures surrounded by mental echoes > of their physical surroundings. > In recent years, Pick has moved from painting the nightmare directly to > implying it in a more intangible yet somehow more threatening way. A huge > darkness is now present in many of the works ‚Äì not an absence of light, but > a presence of black, a darkness which clearly shows the influence of > Goya.\\"Art seen: Gothic, magic realist and surrealist art\\", Otago Daily > Times, 10 June 2010. Retrieved 8 March 2015. In 2012 Pick produced paintings that were used as the basis for the opening credits for New Zealand director Jane Campion's BBC television series Top of the Lake. In more recent years, Pick has turned to the internet for her source material for her paintings. Her 2013 exhibition Wankered Again at Michael Lett Gallery (works from which were shown in 2014 at the Ilam Campus Gallery in Christchurch) included paintings that drew on photographs of drunken teenagers that had been posted on the web. Pick's work has often been interpreted as autobiographical. However, in an interview published in her 2009 monograph Seraphine Pick the artist stated: > I choose images because I like them, not because of any meaning they might > have. I might take images from something I've seen or read, or I'll make > them up, and that image becomes the starting point. I start adding other > things, and that triggers feelings or creates an atmosphere which makes me > think of something else. It's quite an organic process: building up > different layers of thought, working out ideas on the painting almost on a > subconscious level, plaiting the making and the concept together so that the > painting process itself creates the content. In a 2015 interview the artist explained that she is not wedded to any one style or approach to painting: > I keep changing. I don't sit still for long. That's just me exploring > painting really. There are just endless possibilities with it. I'm a > figurative artist and there's just so many ways you can approach figuration, > so I've always tried out lots of different things.

It was published in 2014 by Riverhead Books. The novel spans several decades and explores the attempted assassination of Bob Marley in Jamaica in 1976 and its aftermath, through the crack wars in New York City in the 1980s and a changed Jamaica in the 1990s. Synopsis The novel has five sections, each named after a musical track and covering the events of a single day: *‚ÄúOriginal Rockers: December 2, 1976‚Äù *‚ÄúAmbush in the Night: December 3, 1976‚Äù *‚ÄúShadow Dancin‚Äô: February 15, 1979‚Äù *‚ÄúWhite Lines/Kids in America: August 14, 1985‚Äù *‚ÄúSound Boy Killing: March 22, 1991‚Äù The first part of the novel is set in Kingston, Jamaica, in the build-up to the Smile Jamaica Concert held on 5 December 1976, and describes politically motivated violence between gangs associated with the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and the People's National Party (PNP), especially in the West Kingston neighbourhoods of Tivoli Gardens and Mathews Lane (renamed in the novel as Copenhagen City and Eight Lanes), including involvement of the CIA in the Jamaican politics of the time. As well as Marley (who is referred to as \\"the Singer\\" throughout), other real-life characters depicted or fictionalized in the book include Kingston gangsters Winston \\"Burry Boy\\" Blake and George \\"Feathermop\\" Spence, Claude Massop and Lester Lloyd Coke (Jim Brown) of the JLP and Aston Thomson (Buckie Marshall) of the PNP. Awards The book was awarded the 2015 Man Booker Prize. This marked the first time that a Jamaican-born author has won the prize.

The orbiter was initially proposed to be launched in September 2022 to link ground controllers with rovers and landers and extend mapping capabilities expected to be lost when the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2001 Mars Odyssey stop functioning, but officials elected to focus on flying the Perseverance rover first to cache various samples for a later sample-return mission that will incorporate a Mars telecom orbiter, now envisioned for the late 2020s. Features 2 kW Ion thruster in operation as part of the Hall Thruster Experiment at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Key features under study include solar electric ion drive engines, better solar arrays, and broadband laser communications (optic communication) between Earth and Mars. The orbiter is conceptually similar to the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, canceled in 2005, and could be a technology precursor for a future round-trip sample return mission and human expeditions to Mars. Robert Lock is leading the concept studies for the 2022 orbiter. Concern in NASA is that the currently used relay satellites, 2001 Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, may stop functioning, resulting in the need to press the MAVEN science orbiter into use as a backup telecommunications relay. Since the highly elliptical orbit of MAVEN limits its usefulness as a relay for surface operations, NASA will lower its orbit from to between altitude, where it can serve as a relay while continuing its science mission. Another suggested feature under study is \\"the sample rendezvous capture and return capability\\". The samples cached by the Mars 2020 rover would be placed in Mars orbit by a future Mars ascent vehicle. From there, the orbiter would rendezvous, transfer the samples into a capsule and send it back to Earth. =Propulsion= The proposed orbiter would be propelled with two solar-electric ion thrusters; one engine would be active while the other one would be a spare. Electrical power to the engines would be provided by advanced solar arrays that generate 20 kW. An ion engine would give the spacecraft significant orbital flexibility for long-term support of future missions, opportunistic flybys of Phobos and Deimos, as well as the added capability of orbit support‚Äîrendezvous and capture‚Äîfor a sample return mission. An ion engine would also allow access to multiple latitudes and altitudes to optimize relay contacts. =Suggested payload= * Broadband laser communications (optic communication) between Earth and Mars * High resolution imager (30 cm/pixel) * Potential for rendezvous and capture of soil samples * Water ice detection and mapping * Potential for additional instruments from international partners Proposed sample return Sample return concept of the Mars ascent vehicle (MAV) The orbiter mission has been suggested by the Planetary Science Decadal Survey to be one of three missions comprising the proposed Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign. Samples would be collected and cached by the Mars 2020 mission and would be left on the surface of Mars for possible later retrieval. The orbiter would be launched on a medium-class vehicle, reaching Mars in about nine months and set to aerobrake down to a circular orbit over six to nine months. The third mission of the proposed MSR campaign, the lander, would nominally be launched two years after the orbiter launch. The lander would deploy a \\"fetch rover\\" to retrieve the sample caches. A container holding the samples would be launched by a Mars ascent vehicle (MAV) and placed in a 500-km orbit comparable with the new orbiter and perform a rendezvous while in Mars orbit. The container would be transferred to an Earth entry vehicle (EEV) which would bring it to Earth, enter the atmosphere under a parachute and hard-land for retrieval and analyses in specially designed safe laboratories. Status Some NASA officials consider the Mars 2022 orbiter an \\"essential orbital support for sample return\\", \\"significant\\" in maintaining the Martian communications infrastructure, and desirable for the continuity in remote sensing. The President's FY2017 Budget provided $10 million to begin early conceptual work on the proposed Mars orbiter. In July 2016, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory awarded five $400,000 sub-contracts to conduct concept studies. The five engineering companies are Boeing, Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, Orbital ATK, and Space Systems/Loral. However, in August 2017, Jim Green of NASA's Planetary Science Division stated that a 2022 launch for the orbiter was \\"probably off the table\\", as it would be too difficult to assemble an orbiter with all of the desired features in that time frame. Jim Watzin of NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated in September 2017 that the orbiter may have to be cancelled, citing that \\"the likelihood of all of the relay orbiters failing is so low that no more investments are needed for that purpose.\\" In February 2018, NASA announced that it was moving ahead with plans to alter the orbit of the MAVEN orbiter to have it serve as a communications relay. It will be lowered to altitude, where it can serve as a relay while allowing it to continue its science mission. In March 2018, NASA officials decided that the aging Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) will be managed such that it will continue service for about ten more years, and the program will now focus its resources on flying a sample-return mission first. The 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter will also be managed to continue operating until about 2025. A new Mars relay orbiter is likely to take part in the sample- return architecture envisioned for the late 2020s.

She was a central figure in Constructivist avant-garde in the early 20th century alongside El Lissitzky, Alexander Rodchenko other and her husband Gustav Klutsis. She is known for the Soviet revolutionary and Stalinist propaganda she produced in collaboration with Klutsis.  Biography  Klutsis and Kulagina in 1922, photomontage by Klutsis Kulagina left State Free Art Studios and entered the state-run art school Vkhutemas in 1920 at the urging of teacher Gustav Klutsis, whom she had recently met. On 2 February 1921, the couple wed and lived together at the school's headquarters.Gustav Klutsis and Valentina Kulagina: Photography and Montage After Constructivism. museum.icp.org (2004) In 1928, Kulagina joined the artists' group October, of which her husband was already a member. In 1930 she designed a poster for International Working Women's Day, employing avant-garde techniques combined with typography, lithography, and photomontage. Starting in 1932 Kulagina saw her works frequently rejected by the Communist Party's Central Committee. Her work as a designer began before she graduated the school, with the Soviet Pavilion at the Pressa exhibition in Cologne including areas which she designed. Later, she worked for IZOGIZ (the State Art Publishing Agency) and VOKS (the All-Union Society of Cultural Relations with Abroad) and VSKhV (The All-Union Agricultural Exhibition). Klutsis' and Kulagina's work was complementary, and their style of photomontage combined with graphic work saw them implemented as official revolutionary poster producers for the Communist Party under Stalin. On 17 January 1938, Klutsis was arrested as he prepared to leave for the New York World's Fair. Kulagina was never told the truth as to what happened to her husband, believing for the remainder of her life that he had died of a heart attack while imprisoned. In 1989, two years after her death in Moscow, it was discovered that he had been executed by order of Stalin, very soon after his arrest.  Work  Within the early formation of Soviet Union, politics was a potent influence on the artistic community, and the art and design produced during this early period is known for its revolutionary zeal and joyous utopianism. With this subject matter, Kulagina's work combined drawing and graphic symbolism with photomontage techniques (that had been pioneered by her husband). It was a combination that distinctively separated her work from Klutsis'. Klutsis and Kulagina never worked on projects together, their work was collaborative nevertheless, and was strengthened by one being around the other. Though Klutsis and Kulagina are known for these official pieces for the government, they also ran a personal art and photography practice, utilising styles such as superimposition and photomontage, often portraits of each other. As the political environment in Russia began to dissolve in the 1930s, Klutsis and Kulagina came under increasing pressure to limit the subject matter and humour that they had employed for official posters and graphic work, and their posters came to represent Stalinist visual rhetoric and propaganda rather than its original revolutionary hope.

Described by Austrian naturalist Rudolf Kner in 1866, it comprises two subspecies that have been regarded as separate species in the past and may be once again with further study. It is a common fish of rivers and estuaries along the eastern seaboard from Cape York in north Queensland to southern New South Wales, the Burdekin Gap in central-north Queensland dividing the ranges of the two subspecies. A small silvery fish averaging around in total length, the Pacific blue-eye is recognisable by its blue eye ring and two dorsal fins. It forms loose schools of tens to thousands of individuals. It eats water-borne insects as well as flying insects that land on the water's surface, foraging for them by sight. The Pacific blue-eye adapts readily to captivity. Taxonomy Austrian naturalist Rudolf Kner described the species in 1866, from a specimen collected in Sydney in 1858 during the course of the Novara Expedition and taken to Vienna by the SMS Novara. German‚ÄìBritish zoologist Albert G√ºnther described Atherina signata from collections in Cape York in 1867. British entomologist William Sharp Macleay named a \\"curious little fish\\" collected from the Bremer River, a tributary of the Brisbane River, by one Mr Jameson of Ipswich, Atherinosoma jamesonii in 1884; it was later classified as the same species by Australian ichthyologist James Douglas Ogilby in 1908. Variable across its range, the Pacific blue-eye is considered to be a single species, though it has been split by some into northern signata and southern signifer, with the former found from Ross River northwards and the southern from the Calliope River south. The division occurs at a biogeographic barrier known as the Burdekin Gap. In their 1919 monograph of the family Atherinidae, David Starr Jordan and Carl Leavitt Hubbs maintained the two as separate species‚ÄîP. signifer and P. signata‚Äîbased on the number of rays in the dorsal fins and differences in the filaments of males. Gilbert Whitley examined material from the Low Isles off Cairns and maintained them as separate in 1935. In 1979, Hadfield and colleagues analysed the two species and felt that the variations within both species were greater than those between them and that no characteristics enabled people to distinguish either species. Hence they recommended combining the species again. However, a 2002 and a further 2004 molecular study showed the two populations were genetically distinct and suggested that they may be once again reclassified as species. Species from the northern and southern extremes of the range do not appear to interbreed in captivity, suggesting that there may be two separate species within the current concept of the species. Alternative names include southern blue-eye and northern blue-eye. Within the northern population, five distinct lineages (or subclades) have been identified: one from Ross River and Herbert River, a second from Johnstone, Barron and Tully Rivers, a third from Mulgrave/Russell River and Trinity Inlet, a fourth from Daintree and Mossman Rivers and a fifth from Low Isles and Cape Melville. Four subclades have been identified in the southern population: the first from the Don, Calliope, Pioneer and Kolan Rivers, the second from Burnett and Mary Rivers, the third from Pine River and the fourth from Clarence River southwards. Description The Pacific blue- eye generally reaches a total length of around long; males can reach and females . The size of Pacific blue-eyes found north of the Burdekin Gap increases directly with distance from the gap, males and females being the same size. South of the Burdekin Gap, the species exhibits marked size difference between sexes, which becomes more pronounced as the distance from the gap increases. The elongate body is partly transparent and pale yellow or olive with a silver operculum and belly. The scales are relatively large and longer vertically than horizontally. The eye is large and has a blue iris. There are two dorsal fins, the first arising in line with or just posterior to the longest pectoral fin ray. The forked tail fin has rounded tips. The bottom and top edges of the tail fin are edged with white. The male has extended filaments on its dorsal, anal and pelvic fins. There are black markings at the base of the anterior rays of the anal and rear dorsal fins, and the front (anterior edge) is sometimes white and the rear (posterior) edge greyish in colour. The male's fins may turn orange during breeding season. Preserved specimens generally discolour to yellow or tan. The Pacific blue-eye can be distinguished from the highly invasive and noxious introduced eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) by its forked tail fin. Distribution and habitat The Pacific blue-eye is found from Narooma in southern New South Wales north to the Rocky River in Cape York, though it is uncommon in eastern Cape York. It lives in small, generally slow moving, streams to estuaries, as well as dune lagoons and salt marshes. It is also found in brackish and marine waters on some Queensland offshore islands such as Hinchinbrook Island, Lizard Island, Low Island and Dunk Island. It has been recorded as far as 300 km (185 mi) upstream in the Mary and Dawson Rivers in Queensland. Numbers can be prolific in some locations, such as the Mary River. Conversely it is uncommon in the Elliott and Kolan Rivers. Fish species it is commonly found with include Marjorie's hardyhead (Craterocephalus marjoriae), crimson-spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia duboulayi), Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni) and western carp gudgeon (Hypseleotris klunzingeri). In the wet tropics, the Pacific blue-eye is mostly found in streams flowing up to per second, or rarely per second. Within fast-flowing areas, it shelters in areas of slower- moving water‚Äîless than per second‚Äîsometimes in the lower half of the water column or in the lee of underwater rocks. Further south in southeastern Queensland it is mostly found in water flowing more slowly than per second. It can also be found in tidal pools that become isolated from rivers at low tide. The Pacific blue-eye also forages in mangroves; a field study in the waters around Hinchinbrook Island and near Ingham on mainland Queensland nearby found that the species entered mangroves with the incoming tide as soon as the water was deep enough to swim in but left again an hour later as they kept to areas of shallow water. A field study in two lakes polluted by coal mine runoff in central Queensland found that the Pacific blue-eye was more resistant than tadpoles of the striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) to adverse health effects. The fish species did not suffer acutely but showed markers of compromised health in the long term. Behaviour The Pacific blue-eye is found in loose schools of tens to thousands of fish. They are generally found in the mid- to upper water column within 1 metre (3 ft) of the riverbank and often close to underwater cover. The Pacific blue-eye is euryhaline‚Äîit can survive in a wide range of water salinities from fresh-water to marine environments. It responds to changes in salinity (and resulting change in buoyancy) by changing the volume of its swim bladder, which takes up to 6 hours and 40 minutes when salinity is reduced and around 5 hours when it is increased. In the meantime, the fish can swim with a head-up or head-down posture, which either increases or decreases buoyancy respectively. This adaptation helps the fish in the range of salinities it encounters in its estuarine environment. In a school of Pacific blue-eyes that is threatened, a few individuals accelerate and change direction, which initiates an escape wave that spreads through the whole cohort. Animals are known to dart in random directions and speeds as an escape response when threatened. Pacific blue-eyes on their own dart in this manner for up to ten seconds after being faced with a threat at close range. This period is briefer when faced with more distant threats or for fish in schools. Breeding Female Pacific blue- eyes are sexually mature at six months of age or when they have reached in standard length. Males are mature at standard length. A study published in 2003 showed that males will preferentially choose larger females‚Äîwho are more fecund as a rule‚Äîunless more energy is required to do so, such as swimming further against a current. Fish can breed in fresh and salt water. The life span of the species is around 1‚Äì2 years in the wild, and around 2‚Äì3 years in aquariums, though some males may reach 4 years of age. In an aquarium, Pacific blue-eyes spawn in gravel or moss at the base of aquatic plants. An experiment housing Pacific blue-eyes and mosquitofish together showed that growth and breeding of the former fish were severely affected by the presence of the latter. The mechanism was unclear‚Äîthere were some signs of direct aggression (bite marks on fins of Pacific blue-eyes) but stress from contact was thought to be a major factor. Feeding The diet consists of water-based and terrestrial insects, flying insects, such as various types of fly, and, to a lesser extent, tiny crustaceans and algae. Field work on Narrabeen Lakes showed that Pacific blue-eyes spent time near the surface looking for dead flying insects, consuming anything below their mouth gape size. This varied from around 2.5 to 3.5 mm, and was proportional to the length of the fish. The Pacific blue-eye forages using vision, and the turbidity of the water affects its ability to find food.

Kennedy Nolan principally work on residential projects, but their folio expands to include educational, retail and hospitality projects. Despite the increasing scale of their work, they retain a domestic intimacy to their buildings. Design The form of architectural detail is a preoccupation of Kennedy Nolan. An example of this approach is witnessed at the Laver House where an \\"oversized timber cruciform column\\" is overblown in scale to conceal the corridor behind. This playfulness with details salutes Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, an architectural hero of Kennedy Nolan, who stated \\"God is in the details.\\" Not only details but architectural fundamentals such as stairs and walls undergo examination with Kennedy Nolan. Architectural historian Philip Goad stated that: \\"What sets Kennedy Nolan apart from other practices in Melbourne is their investigation into the art of the wall. While the work of Mies is a referent, it [for Kennedy Nolan] is only a ghost of one.\\" Influences Kennedy Nolan cite Brutalist architecture and the Arts and Crafts movement as being influential upon their work, as they admire the \\"cultural sensitivity of the arts and crafts with the social optimism and technical empowerment of modernism.\\" Modernist projects such as The Barbican Estate by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon, Clyde Cameron College by Architects Group's Kevin Borland and Bernard Brown, and Marcel Breuer's Hooper House II and House Pack have been influential on the practice. Notable works =Leahy Swingler House, James Street= Kennedy Nolan's first project Leahy Swingler House was the renovation of a dilapidated Edwardian House in Melbourne's inner north. Kennedy Nolan's attention to the abstract form of architectural fundamentals is evident on the street elevation with an over-scaled chamfered chimney that accentuates the building's street presence. The commission was the catalyst for Rachel Nolan and Patrick Kennedy to begin their office. It received a Victorian chapter Australian Institute of Architects award for alterations and additions in 2001. =George Street= In 2004 Kennedy Nolan redeveloped an old factory site in Fitzroy into three-townhouses, each on approximately 85 square meters of land. The new three-story complex incorporates a single-story 1970s brick warehouse, which enabled the project to have zero setback from the adjacent property. Appearing as an abstract hybrid of house and factory, Patrick Kennedy states that this project \\"was our first chance to make the form in the public realm.\\" Awards * 2001 - AIA, Victorian Architecture Award: Residential Alterations & Additions * 2004 - AIA, Victorian Architecture Award: Multi-residential * 2007 - AIA, Victorian Architecture Award: Residential Alterations & Additions * 2013 - AIA, Victorian Architecture Award: Residential New * 2014 - AIA, Victorian Architecture Award: Residential Alterations & Additions * 2014 - AIA, Victorian Architecture Award: Residential Alterations & Additions * 2014 - Interior Design Excellence Awards (IDEA): Winner - Overall *2019 - AIA, Victorian Architecture Award: Residential New, Sandy Point House *2019 - AIA, Victorian Architecture Commendation: Residential New, Fitzroy Lane References External links * Category:Architecture firms of Australia Category:Architecture firms based in Victoria (Australia) Category:Australian women architects Category:Design companies established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in Australia Category:21st-century Australian architects ","title":"Kennedy Nolan"},{"id":"45612241","text":"Purification is an independent supernatural thriller film written, directed, and produced by Joseph Ciminera.

Plot Bret Fitzpatrick (Joe Ciminera) is a New York real-estate developer who values his business and money over the well- being of his family and friends. Bret has had a difficult childhood and all the success he has had in his life makes him want more. Soon Bret has to travel back to his home town to evict Mrs. Keller (Natalie Swan) his tenant due to late rent payments. Bret arrives at Mrs. Keller's rented house and gives her 12 days time to vacate the house. Mrs. Keller agrees to vacate the premises but requests for longer time but Bret does not agree. As he leaves the premises, he is distracted by a call and nearly gets hit by a car after walking into its path. After this, Bret starts seeing dead people. He sees his dead sister and goes to a priest to consult him. The rest of the movie is about Bret coming to terms with his imminent death.

Description Traditionally, a kick space is allowed for in modern cabinet designs by creating a separate, recessed platform upon which one's cabinetry may rest. The kick space is intended to prevent potential toe injuries and allow for closer proximity to a countertop (the toes being the furthest-extending ground-level human body parts). Typical dimensions are roughly high by deep. A fully enclosed cabinet base with a kick space. Many homes take advantage of this space by installing heating or ventilation ducts here. It also provides the additional advantage of serving as a \\"bumper against over-zealous mopping and vacuuming\\".  History  The kick space became more common in the 20th century. With a burgeoning middle class and advancements in industry and domesticity, countertops became a more prominent work surface. Whereas previously most standing crafts were done at tables, there developed a need for a work counter to which one could comfortably stand directly adjacent. As the name would suggest, the kick space provides a space in which one's toes can rest.

In 1938, she became the first Australian woman to graduate with a Diploma of Architectural Design. Four years later she became the first woman to be elected to an Australian Architectural Institute council in 1942, as well as the first female Fellow of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects in 1946. That same year, she became the first Australian woman to become a partner in a large firm. Ellison Harvie was recognised as an expert in hospital planning and administration, working on numerous Australian projects, including Mercy Hospital in East Melbourne (1934‚Äì36) and the original four multi-storey buildings of the Royal Melbourne Hospital (1936‚Äì41).  Early life and education  Ellison Harvie was born on 18 May 1902 in Prahran, Melbourne. Her parents were Robert William Harvie, a photographer, and his wife Alice Edington. As a child, Ellison Harvie was fascinated by architecture and encouraged by her father. After having attended Warwick, a girls' school in East Malvern, she sought to gain employment as an articled assistant at a Melbourne practice. However, as she was unsuccessful, she enrolled at Swinburne Technical College in 1920 and continued her architectural training there for three years. In 1921, she was invited by her lecturer Arthur Stephenson to join his newly established firm and serve her articles there. The firm, formed with Percy Meldrum, specialised in the design of hospitals, public housing developments and commercial developments. After graduating from Swinburne Technical College, she travelled to Europe to broaden her architectural knowledge and to learn about the latest trends and techniques in architecture. In 1925 she returned to Melbourne, where she completed her articles at Stephenson & Meldrum. It was at this time that she also attended the Architectural Atelier at the University of Melbourne, where she studied until 1928. Along with other architects at the Atelier, such as Margaret Morison, the course prepared articled students for the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects qualifying exams. Harvie won both the University of Melbourne's Atelier award and the President's Prize for best student work in 1927. In 1938 Harvie became the first Australian female recipient of a Diploma of Architectural Design.  Career  Ellison Harvie registered with the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects in 1926 and was elected an associate in 1928. The same year that she registered, Stephenson & Meldrum appointed her architect in charge of the Jessie MacPherson Wing of the Queen Victoria Hospital in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne. She would go on to contribute to every hospital project the firm worked on in Melbourne and Sydney during the 1930s, leading the work on St Vincent's Hospital (1933), Mercy Hospital (1934‚Äì36) and Freemasons Hospital (1935). As Stephenson & Meldrum's international reputation grew, its restructuring into Stephenson & Turner in 1937 saw Ellison Harvie being made an associate of the firm. In this new role she became responsible for running the Melbourne headquarters while a new office in Sydney was being established. When war broke out in 1945 however, Harvie effectively ran both practices. She was made a partner of the firm- the first Australian woman to do so in a large practice. As well as qualifying as an accountant, she developed a new building contract that could adjust to the economic instability of the time. Throughout the remainder of her career, Ellison Harvie cultivated a high public profile as a successful female architect, being mostly involved in large commercial and civic projects, rather than in residential architecture (the traditional domain of female architects). She was a strong advocate for the professional development of women and for their participation in public life. Melbourne's Lyceum Clubrooms (1959) and St Hilda's College (1963), Melbourne University, two of her few private commissions, were built to specifically serve women and clearly demonstrate the strong influence of International Modernism in her work. Harvie sat on the committees of the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects from 1929 and was a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Frustrated with the lack of architectural appreciation in Australia, she served on the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects Board of Architectural Education from 1946 until 1956 and on the board of the University of Melbourne's Faculty of Architecture from 1945 until 1973. In 1942 she became the first woman to be elected to an Australian Architectural Institute council and, later, was a life fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. She continued to work on hospitals until her retirement from full-time practice in 1968. Ellison Harvie died at East Melbourne on 27 September 1984 and was buried in Boroondara cemetery, Kew.

Biography Chen was born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He entered the imperial civil service and received the title of Jinshi (the highest and final degree in the imperial examination) in 1903. From 1904 to 1906, Chen was in Japan, studying political science and constitutional law at Hosei University. Following the Xinhai Revolution and the subsequent establishment of the Republic of China in 1912, Chen was selected as a representative to the National Assembly. He served in various important positions until 1915, including Secretary of the State Council and Secretary to the President's Office. However, he increasingly opposed the authoritarian tendencies of Yuan Shikai.Biography mingrenzhuan.com, August 28, 2014 From the late 1910s to the late 1930s Chen held a number of important positions, including Chairman of the Commercial Press in Shanghai and Chairman of The National Commercial Bank. Chen actively opposed the Japanese occupation during the Second Sino-Japanese War, categorically refusing to collaborate with the Japanese, who made an offer to appoint him as Mayor of Shanghai. After the end of the war, his many disagreements with Chiang Kai-Shek led him to escape to Hong Kong through an underground Communist Party of China organization in 1948. Following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Chen, who was present at the inauguration ceremony of the People's Republic standing next to Mao Zedong, went on to serve as a Vice Chairman of both the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from 1949 until his death in 1966, as well as Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce from 1953 until his death. Chen Shutong (far right) joins Mao Zedong in the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949 He was the author of numerous works on law and political science, including \\"Politics\\" and \\"General Theory of Politics and Law\\"; he also published poetry collections.

The number of Hindus, like the number of Muslims, fluctuates repeatedly. As of the 2006 Samoan Census, there were 25 Hindus. More than 55% of Hindus are concentrated in Faleata West. Growth and demographics Hinduism in Samoa began in the late 20th century, though natural disasters have made some of the fewer than 100 Hindus emigrate. Hinduism was not in the 2001 Census, possibly because it did not have any adherents at the time, unlike Muslims (48). Hinduism was added in the 2006 Census, which stated that there were 25 Hindus, 12 being male and 13 female. Due to smaller numbers, the Muslim and Hindu population count was merged in the 2011 Census, with the total now being 38 adherents. The 2011 Census stated that of the 38 Muslims/Hindus, 25 were male and 13 female. This gender imbalance, which has inflated the proportion of male to females, may have been a consequence of the 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami, when more than 150 people died and many emigrated.

The Valz Prize (Prix Valz) was awarded by the French Academy of Sciences, from 1877 through 1970, to honor advances in astronomy. History The Valz Prize was established in June 1874 when the widow of astronomer Benjamin Valz, Marie Madeleine Julie Malhian, donated 10,000 francs to establish a prize in honor of her late husband. The Valz Prize was to be awarded for work of similar stature as that honored by the pre-existing Lalande Prize. The first Valz Prize was awarded in 1877 to brothers Paul and Prosper Henry, and was for the sum of 460 francs. Save for 1924, the French Academy of Sciences awarded the Valz Prize annually from 1877 to 1943. After 1943, the prize was awarded only sporadically (only once per decade from 1950 to 1970). In 1970 the Valz Prize was combined with the Lalande Prize to create the Lalande-Valz Prize, which continued to be awarded through 1996. In 1997, that prize was combined with numerous other Academy prizes to create the Grande M√©daille.

Biography Lennon was born in Dublin, Ireland to parents William Lennon Snr and his wife Ann (n√©e Martin). Arriving with his family in Melbourne in 1855 he received his education there and by 1870 he was employed as a clerk with the Victorian Mines Department. In 1874 he joined the Bank of Australasia and was posted at Creswick and it was here that he made friends with David Temple and William Spence, two pioneers of the trade union movement in Australia.Lennon, William (1849‚Äì1938) - Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 1 May 2016. In 1881 he was transferred to Townsville to open a branch of the bank there and later supervised its expansion to other centres in North Queensland and by 1885 he was working in Sydney as a sub-inspector. He left the bank a year later to take up the role of manager of Burns, Philp & Co. Ltd. He was employed there for ten years but clashes with James Burns over administrative procedures and salary levels led to his resignation and Lennon then established his own mercantile and auctioneering business in Townsville. He was a director of the Bank of North Queensland and the Townsville Gas Company. On 29 November 1877 Lennon married Mary Cecilia Ryan (died 1937) at Ballarat and together had three sons and three daughters.Family history research -- Queensland Government births, deaths, marriages, and divorces.

As per Lennon's personal wishes, his family declined the offer of a state funeral and his funeral at the Toowong Cemetery was attended by a few close relatives. Public career Lennon started off his career by being a councilor on the Thuringowa Divisional Board. Then at the 1899 Queensland colonial election, representing the Labour Party, he unsuccessfully stood against his former employer, Robert Philp, for the seat of Townsville. In 1907, he stood for the seat of Herbert and narrowly defeated the sitting member, Alfred Cowley. He would go on to represent the electorate until his resignation on 1920 to take up the role of Lieutenant-Governor of Queensland. For the last four months he was the Speaker of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and from 1915 until 1919 the Secretary for Agriculture and Stock. When the first majority Labor government came to power in 1915, it found itself up against a hostile Queensland Legislative Council. The Labour Party saw the Council as undemocratic and a tool of patronage and wanted it abolished. After Bills for this purpose were rejected by the Council itself in 1915 and 1916, the government held a referendum to abolish it in 1917, but the people of Queensland rejected it. Hon. William Lennon ‚Äì taken from The Men Of Queensland 1929 Soon after the referendum, and apparently on the urging of the Labor government, the Queensland Governor, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams appointed thirteen new members, all of whom whose political allegiance lay with Labor, to the Council. As the council continued to reject money bills, Ryan urged the Governor to appoint more members to the Council in 1918, but this request was refused. Goold-Adams' term as Governor of Queensland expired in 1920 and before he set sail back home to England, appointed Lennon to the role of Lieutenant-Governor of Queensland with a salary of ¬£1000 per annum.Goold-Adams, Sir Hamilton John (1858‚Äì1920) - Australian Dictionary of Biography.

History =1965= Following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in August 1964, the 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (9th MEB) was activated by United States Pacific Command under Admiral Ulysses S. Grant Sharp. The 3rd Marine Division assistant commander and Medal of Honor recipient, Brigadier General Raymond G. Davis, was appointed its first commander. It consisted of 9th Marine Regiment regimental headquarters and three battalion landing teams (BLT). Almost 6,000 men were transformed into an effective force in readiness. When the Gulf of Tonkin crisis faded, one BLT was sent to Okinawa, another to the Philippines and a third one was served afloat as Special Landing Force of the Seventh Fleet under Admiral Roy L. Johnson. The skeleton headquarters of the brigade under BG Davis remained at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay for case of emergency and BG John P. Coursey relieved Davis on October 16, 1964. Meanwhile the situation in South Vietnam became critical, when Viet Cong (VC) forces won the Battle of Binh Gia at the beginning of January 1965 and it became obvious that this was an intensive military challenge which the South Vietnamese government could not meet with its own resources. BG Frederick J. Karch assumed command of the brigade on January 22, 1965 and 1st and 3rd Battalions, 9th Marines took part in the amphibious landing exercise. On 7 February 1965, the VC attacked the U.S. base in Pleiku killing 9 Americans, wounding 128 others and damaging or destroying 25 aircraft. President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered the deployment of 9th MEB to Da Nang by the end of February 1965 with the mission of protecting the Da Nang Air Base from enemy incursion. After initial delay because of negotiations with South Vietnamese government, Karch led his brigade ashore on 7 March 1965 on Red Beach. The 9th MEB was subsequently reinforced by the 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines. President Johnson also permitted a change of mission for the 9th MEB which would allow the use of Marines \\"in active combat under conditions to be established and approved by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the Secretary of State.\\" The Brigade absorbed the Marine Aircraft Group 16 and conducted defense duty at Da Nang for next two months. However with the increasing number of Marine forces in South Vietnam, the 9th MEB was deactivated on 6 May 1965 and reorganized as the III Marine Amphibious Force under Major general William R. Collins. =1966= The unit was reactivated on March 1, 1966 as 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade (9th MAB) on Okinawa, Japan with Colonel Herman Hansen Jr. as temporary commander. The brigade was designated Special Landing Force of the Seventh Fleet. BG William A. Stiles arrived on 30 March and assumed command of the brigade. Colonel Hansen Jr. was appointed brigade's chief of staff. The Brigade was composed of Headquarters and the Headquarters Company, Regimental Landing Team 5, Battalion Landing Team 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines and Sub Unit Two, Headquarters&Service; Company, 1st Service Battalion. The Brigade received its air unit, Marine Aircraft Group 13 (Reinforced) on 15 April 1966 and now was responsible for most Marine air and ground units in the Western Pacific outside of Vietnam. BG Michael P. Ryan relieved BG Stiles as commanding General on that date. Regimental Landing Team 5 was relieved by newly organized 26th Marine Regiment and the 9th MAB participated in Operation Osage between 27 April and 3 May 1966. The 9th MAB was assigned to the mission of destroying a VC battalion and elements of a People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) regiment reported to be operating in Th·ª´a Thi√™n-Hu·∫ø Province. The results were inconclusive with 8 VC killed while Marine losses were eight killed and 9 wounded. The 9th MAB provided Battalion Landing Team (BLT) of 1st Battalion, 26th Marines for Operation Deckhouse IV from 15‚Äì18 September 1966. The 9th MAB's Marines killed over 200 PAVN soldiers from 90th Regiment with the loss of 36 Marines. During the rest of the year, the 9th MAB and its units were stationed off the northern coast of South Vietnam in order to provide force for the defense of Vietnam Demilitarized Zone in case of emergency. =1967= BG Louis Metzger assumed command of the 9th MAB on 4 January 1967 and led it during Operation Deckhouse V in B·∫øn Tre Province a few days later. The Battalion Landing Team 1/9, now assigned to the 9th MAB, took part in the operation, but due to forewarning, the VC left the area before the attack. The units of 9th MAB killed only 21 VC and lost 7 Marines. III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) launched Operation Desoto on 27 January 1967 against known VC strongholds in the region. The 9th MAB launched the Operation Deckhouse VI on 16 February in order to disrupt enemy movement in the vicinity of Sa Huynh salt flats, search northward in the Nui Dat area, and, finally, link up with the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, then operating around Nui Dat in Operation Desoto. BLT 1/4 confirmed the presence of VC in the area, but enemy concentrated only on delaying and harassing tactics. BLT 1/4 destroyed 167 fortifications and captured 20 tons of assorted supplies during the 32 days of Phase I of Operation Deckhouse VI. Though there never were any major contacts, the BLT claimed 201 VC killed during this period; only 6 Marines died. On February 27, Phase II of Deckhouse VI started, but there was only occasional contact with the enemy and intermittent sniper fire marked the only enemy reactions. In the six days required to accomplish the Phase II, the battalion killed 78 more VC, destroyed 145 fortifications, and captured an additional five tons of supplies. Similarly, as in Phase I, 6 Marines died. Because of a growing threat to Firebase Gio Linh, III MAF launched Operation Beacon Hill on 20 March 1967. BLT 1/4 and Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron 363 were ordered for the mission. The contact with the enemy was light until March 21, when the BLT 1/4 engaged about 80 PAVN troops, killing 14 of them. The next day the battalion made contact again between Gio Linh and Con Thien. After a stiff fight the PAVN, apparently a company, withdrew leaving 43 bodies behind. Progress during both days was slow because the PAVN laced their positions with connecting tunnels which required detailed search. On 26 March, after two days of air and artillery preparation, BLT 1/4 broke through two well-prepared defensive trench lines and cleared the interconnecting tunnel system. The PAVN subsequently withdrew and only sniper fire and minor rear guard actions slowed the advancing Marines. The operation ended on April 1 and BLT 1/4 suffered 29 Marines killed and 230 wounded. The PAVN lost 334 men. Following Operation Beacon Hill, 1/4 Marines was transferred back to the 3rd Marine Division and 9th MAB's Special Landing Force (SLF) was reorganized into twin concept: SLF Alpha, which consisted of HMM-263 and the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines and SLF Bravo formed with 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines and HMM-164. The landing exercise at Kin Blue Beach, Okinawa followed during April 1967, where the 9th MAB practiced a combined surface and helicopter assault. Metzger's units subsequently participated in Operation Beacon Star between 22 April and 12 May 1967, where he could test SLF new concept. The main target of the operation was a VC stronghold and supply area along the border of Quang Tri and Thua Thien Provinces. Intelligence officers reported two battalions of the VC 6th Regiment and two main force battalions, the 810th and the 814th, were operating in the region. Due to bad weather and poor visibility, SLF Bravo launched a combined helicopter and overland assault which killed 940 VC with Marine losses of 71 killed and 349 wounded. Simultaneously with Operation Beacon Star, the 9th MAB took part in the Operation Beaver Cage between 28 April and 13 May 1967. SLF Alpha containing BLT 1/3 and HMM-263 and its mission was to clear Que Son Valley, southwest of Da Nang, important to the VC as a source of both food and manpower. The SLF Alpha casualties totaled 55 Marines killed and 151 wounded, but in 16 days of continuous operations the BLT claimed 181 VC dead and 66 prisoners. =1969= Commanding generals *BG Raymond G.

On June 12, 1883, the association elected a board of trustees, approved a constitution and by-laws, and made plans for establishing the library. Dr. John Joseph Craven was elected as president, a position he would hold until his death a decade later. A location for the library was found in July, in the back room of Overton‚Äôs Shoe Store, with Floyd Overton serving as de facto librarian. In August 1883, the library was formally dedicated at the First Congregational Church of Patchogue. The library moved frequently over the next seventeen years, alternately being housed in a stationery store, music store, and the New Lyceum theatre, along with other locations. For the remainder of its existence, the Patchogue Library Association worked at fundraising and finding the library a more permanent home. Financial difficulties, infrequent board meetings, a lack of facilities, and a precipitous drop in subscribers lead the eventual close of the PLA. It held its final meeting on October 28, 1899, and the proposal was made that an outside group should take charge of the library and shepherd its transition into a new organizational form was accepted. = Charter = In 1899, the Patchogue chapter of Sorosis, a women‚Äôs suffrage organization, took control of the library collection, and moved it to their club building. It was the aim of Sorosis to change the library from an association library to a public library, arrange a new system of library funding (from membership dues to local budget votes), and provide the library a permanent home. Under the care of the organization, a 1500-book demonstration public library was created and opened for public use. In August 1900, at a school district board meeting, a public vote officially established a new Patchogue Library, and elected its first board of trustees. When the board met the next day, officers were elected and Elizabeth Mott Smith became the first president. Following an inspection by the State Library, the Board of Regents granted Patchogue Library a state charter of incorporation in December 1900. = Carnegie Library = Carnegie Library postcard On its annual budget meeting on August 1, 1905, the school board unanimously agreed to fund the library at $1,000 a year. A lot at 10 Lake Street, a gift from Edwin Bailey, Sr., was used as the building site. Later that year, Carnegie granted the Library Board the funds for construction. In 1907, the construction contract was assigned to John V. Van Pelt of Manhattan. After under-budgeting the cost of construction, Van Pelt went to Carnegie for additional funds. Carnegie reluctantly agreed to provide the funds, as long as the approved maintenance cost, to be paid by the village, could be raised as well. On Tuesday, August 4, 1908, the school board approved an additional $500 in maintenance costs a year for the library, raising the total annual support provided the village to $1,500. Carnegie gave an additional five thousand dollars, which was used to reimburse Van Pelt and the village of Patchogue for expenditures. On March 4, 1908 Patchogue's Carnegie Library was formally dedicated. H. Allen Tenney, Library Building and Committee Chairman, and George D. Gerard, Head of the Board of Education, along with a number of other guests, spoke on the occasion. Carnegie himself was invited to speak at the dedication, but declined. Instead David A. Boody, former mayor of Brooklyn and president of the Brooklyn Public Library Trustees, was sent as a Carnegie representative and gave the dedication address. = Central Library = In 1961, the Suffolk Cooperative Library System (SCLS) was created as one of twenty-three public library systems providing services to 740 public libraries throughout New York State. For the first 10 years of its existence, SCLS operated out of the basement of the Patchogue-Medford Library. In 1978, Patchogue-Medford Library became the New York State-designated Central Library for Suffolk County. In this capacity, the Patchogue-Medford library supplies system-wide reference and collection evaluation services, interlibrary loan, collection services, tours and visits, and workshops, along with access to databases. = Modern period = A population explosion and the continued growth of the library collection in the aftermath of World War II meant that the library facilities would soon need to expand. An addition was added to the Carnegie building for additional space, but would soon be outgrown. In 1951 service was officially extended to Medford residents after the Patchogue and Medford School districts were combined. In 1973, the Patchogue Library officially changed its name to the Patchogue- Medford Library by state charter amendment. After 73 years at the Carnegie building, the library moved to a former W.T. Grants department store on East Main Street in 1981 to accommodate growing its collections and services. The nature and range of electronic resources and services have been steadily expanding and changing, ever since the computer revolution of the 1980s. In 1993, the Neighborhood Center was opened at the Eagle Elementary School, which provides a quiet study place and a large collection of adult and children's fiction to service to the residents of Medford. In 2000, the library celebrated its first 100 years under state charter, a fact noted in a commemorative article in the New York Times. Importance = Cultural impact = Head librarian Alma Custead and her staff at the reference desk. Alma Custead served as librarian from 1914 to 1945. She expanded adult and children‚Äôs collections and services as well as creating a comprehensive catalog for Suffolk County libraries which was housed at the Patchogue library. Custead regularly wrote bibliographies and articles for local newspapers, began services for young adults when such services were still considered experimental, and brought together librarians from around the county in the late 1920s and early 1930s to found the Suffolk County Library Association. She served as its first president, and launched state and countywide library conferences held in Patchogue, which supported local businesses. Custead headed a local book drive to support American troops in World War I, and a county book drive in World War II. In the Great Depression and road to World War II, the library featured business, self-help, and job- related books and works on the growing crisis in international affairs. During World War II, she created the first countywide Union Catalog (multiple library holdings) in Suffolk, and saw to it that it was based at Patchogue Library. She established the library as a center of county library affairs, setting the stage for future developments. She also supervised much needed repairs to the library. =Carnegie Library renovation= Patchogue's Carnegie Library was the first of only two ever built in Suffolk County. The original building (50 feet 6 inches by 45 feet 9 inches) was approximately 2,300 square feet in size and was designed by John Vredenburgh Van Pelt in the neoclassical style. It was in use until 1981 when the then Patchogue-Medford Library relocated to Main Street in Patchogue. The building was the home of Briarcliffe College for a number of years. Today the renovation is complete as the Carnegie Library has been moved to its permanent location next to the Suffolk County 6th District Court on Main Street. The Young Adult Department has moved from the main building into the Carnegie Building and now operates as the Teen Center at Patchogue-Medford Carnegie Library. The move has allowed the Young Adult department to improve its services to teens while expanding already existing services such as reading clubs, homework help, crafts, expanded book collection, etc.  References  External links * Patchogue-Medford Library * Celia M.

The lawsuits gained national attention due to their religious and civil rights implications. Legal case The first two legal cases, Ingersoll v. Arlene's Flowers and State of Washington v. Arlene's Flowers were consolidated by Benton County Superior Court Judge Salvador Mendoza into a single case for purposes of discovery. The first civil suit, Ingersoll v. Arlene's Flowers, was filed by a gay couple after Barronelle Stutzman, the owner of Arlene's Flowers, denied floral arrangements for their wedding. The couple had been customers of Stutzman's shop for nine years, but when they asked her to provide flowers for their wedding, the florist declined, citing her Christian beliefs. The same-sex couple denied Stutzman's services, Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed, were represented by the ACLU in their lawsuit against the business on grounds of discrimination per the anti-discrimination laws of the state of Washington. Attorneys for the ACLU proposed a settlement in the suit with the following conditions: Stutzman making a public apology, donating $5,000 to a local LGBT youth center, and a promise to no longer refuse service to customers based on their sexual orientation. The legal group representing Stutzman, Alliance Defending Freedom, countered the settlement offer, stating she should not be required to violate her religious beliefs. The second suit against Stutzman was a consumer protection suit filed by state Attorney General Bob Ferguson. The premise of the suit, State of Washington v. Arlene's Flowers, was filed by Ferguson in order to uphold the state's Consumer Protection Act. Upon settlement, the decision would bring a $2,000 fine under the Washington Consumer Protection Act, a $1 payment for costs, and agreement not to discriminate in the future. Stutzman, however, responded that she would not comply, with her counsel citing the state's constitution in regard to \\"freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment\\". Following Stutzman's response, Benton County Superior Court Judge Alexander Ekstrom ruled on January 7, 2015 that she could be sued in her personal capacity. A third lawsuit, Arlene's Flowers v. Ferguson, was filed as a countersuit by Stutzman to claim financial hardship she suffered as a result of the previous two lawsuits. Judge Ekstrom ruled on February 18, 2015 that Stuzman had violated the state's anti-discrimination law in both cases. The next day, Stutzman's lawyers announced they would appeal the ruling. On March 27, 2015, Judge Ekstrom ordered Stutzman to pay a $1,000 fine and $1 for court costs and fees. Via GoFundMe, Stutzman received over $174,000 in individual donations before the website removed her donation page citing a violation of their terms of service. GoFundMe stated their policy bars fundraising campaigns it deems discriminatory. On November 15, 2016, state Attorney General Ferguson personally argued the case before the Washington Supreme Court; the hearing was held before an audience at an auditorium on the campus of Bellevue College. On February 16, 2017, the state Supreme Court unanimously ruled against Stutzman, holding that her floral arrangements do not constitute protected free speech, and that providing flowers to a same-sex wedding would not serve as an endorsement of same-sex marriage. Rejecting Stutzman's Free Exercise Clause claim, Justice Sheryl Gordon McCloud wrote, \\"this case is no more about the access to flowers than civil rights cases were about access to sandwiches.\\" Following the state high court's decision, Stutzman filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States, asking the Court to hear the case.Arlene‚Äôs Flowers, Inc. v. Washington, SCOTUSblog. During this case, a similar case, Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, had made its way to the Supreme Court, and which was decided in early June 2018. The ruling was made on procedural grounds in that the bakery owner's religious views were treated with hostility by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, and remanded that a new hearing be made. Stutzman, on this news, stated that she had also found her religious views treated with hostility by the state of Washington, and sought a similar rehearing. On June 25, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Supreme Court of Washington for further consideration in light of the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision.https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062518zor_g3bh.pdf On June 6, 2019, the Washington Supreme Court unanimously ruled against Stutzman again, finding no evidence of religious animus. Stutzman's attorneys have once again requested the U.S. Supreme Court to take her case.

It is another name for Vishnu and also refers to the world, the universe. In literature, this word refers to the entire enchanted universe. The word (‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ) (vishva) appears in the Rig Veda, for example, Rishi Dirghatamas (R.V.I.146.1) states:- : ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß‡•ç‡§¶‡§æ‡§® ‡§∏‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§ó‡•É‡§£‡•Ä‡§∑‡•á‡§Ω‡§®‡•Ç‡§®‡§Æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡•á  : ‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ö‡§∞‡§§‡•ã ‡§ß‡•ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡•ã ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ö‡§®‡§æ‡§™‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç  that just as the seven bright rays of the sun and the brightness of Agni light up the entire world of inanimate and animate objects, so do the learned people with their wisdom gracefully illuminate the minds of all beings for mutual benefits. The Shatapatha Brahmana (IX.iii.1.3‚Äì6) also uses this word as meaning All. In sloka XI.18 of the Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna describing the vision of the universal Purusha states ‚Äì ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§™‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§®‡§ø‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç ‚Äì \\"you are the great treasure house of this Universe\\", in which phrase the compound-word ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø is read as ‚Äì \\"of universe\\". The significance of vishva in Hindu philosophy is revealed in the Upanishads. In the ƒÄgama Prakarana of his Karika on the Mandukya Upanishad Gaudapada explains that in the three states of consciousness, the one and the same object of experience and the experiencer appears in three-fold forms (‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§ß‡§æ ‡§≠‡•ã‡§ó‡§Ç) as ‚Äì ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ (vishva) ('gross'), ‡§§‡•à‡§ú‡§∏ (taijasa) ('subtle') and ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û (prajna) ('the blissful'). He tells us that ‡§¨‡§π‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡•ã ‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡•ã Vishva is he who is all-pervading and who experiences the external (gross) objects but although moving in them is distinct from the witnessed states, ‡§¶‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§ø‡§£‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§ø‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ñ‡•á ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡•ã he who cognizes in the right eye because the right eye is the means of perception of gross objects, ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡•ã ‡§π‡§ø ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡•Ç‡§≤‡§≠‡•Å‡§ô‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç who always experiences the gross (object), ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡•Ç‡§≤‡§Ç ‡§§‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç and whom the gross (object) satisfies because it is in the waking state that the gross is perceived and experienced differently. He states that vishva the first among the three states and first in the three- lettered \\"aum\\" is \\"a\\" the means to cognize its all-pervasiveness, it pervades all thought and speech and makes even words lose their distinct identity in a harmonious whole like the whole which is like the ƒÅkƒÅsha same everywhere. vishva, taijasa and prajna, these three padƒÅs ('quarters') which serve as means, are merged before the fourth, turiya, is realized. Purusha, related to all gross beings as their self, is called vai≈õvƒÅnara because he leads all (vishva) men (nara); vai≈õvƒÅnara is the self, the individual-cosmos-divinity triunity, the self revealed in the waking state. Thus, vishva which is bound to the cause and effect and therefore to duality is the outward oriented consciousness, taijasa which is also bound to cause and effect is the inward oriented consciousness and prajna which is bound to cause alone is the enmassed consciousness; all three are one though thought of as many, and can be experienced in the waking state. Vishva is a pronominal adjective; \\"pronominal adjectives are a class of words which share in common with the real pronouns certain peculiarities of declension, affected only if used in certain sense\\". Vishva is in the group of adjectives which have masculine stems ending in short \\"a\\", and feminine stem ending in long \\"ƒÅ\\". The derivatives of pronominal stems ‚Äì \\"ta\\"- which is demonstrative, \\"ya\\"- which is relative, and \\"ka\\"- which is interrogative, morph as comparative and superlative adjectives and serve as pronouns.

Her distinct illustrative and typographic style was directly influenced by the art world, particularly the works of Paul Klee.  Biography  Marget Larsen was born on September 10, 1922 in San Francisco and grew up in Burlingame, California. Larsen's first job was in the San Francisco department store I. Magnin, and she continued to study at night at the California College of the Arts. After a promotion, Larsen worked in the creative department with advertising managers and artists creating promotional work for the department store, creating a playful environment for the store that won her acclaim. Larsen worked as the art director for the specialty department store Joseph Magnin Co., collaborating with advertising manager Toni Harley and fashion illustrator Betty Brader to establish a distinctive graphic look for the fashionable store. In her early career, Larsen studied with a wide variety of artists and designers, including the sculptor Robert Howard and the jewelry designer Margaret de Patta. Her love of art, particularly the art of Paul Klee, influenced her style greatly. Her work typically ignored stylistic conventions of the time, showcasing illustration or attitude rather that product representation and using vibrant colors, making it a San Francisco approach. Larsen went to work with advertising innovator Howard Gossage at Weiner & Gossage. Together, they were recognized with changing the face of print advertising at the time, with projects like the paper bags for the Parisian Bakery, which was the first time paper bags had been decorated beautifully as a promotional device, to developing the first ecology ads of the 1960s. In 1964, she began freelancing, working with Leonard Martin, The Cannery, the Sierra Club, and Alvin Duskin as clients. The San Francisco Show named their design and art direction award after Larsen. Marget Larsen died of cancer in 1984, at the age of 62.

She explained why she had decided to put that name to the new album The concept is that you call Balas y Chocolate for things that live: we are among those ideas bullets and excesses, but also the chocolate remains and symbolizes our strength; it's a bit like corn represents what we are Mexicans, in Mayan and Olmec culture that is very important\\".

One side of the cover has a lenticular in which, on one side, Downs appears posing in an archaeological center of Oaxaca, and the other side is a skull-shaped drawing by plastic artist Humberto Valdez. The booklet is full of abstract images representing each of the songs that are strongly related to the current Mexican society, and also includes a poster with the route of Lila Downs referring to the \\"Dearly Departed\\". demos of several songs from the album were broadcast online by the channel Live Nation by Yahoo!

Ely established her reputation as an environmental artist in the early 1970s through her work on the Murray Darling rivers. She has a diverse practice across various media and has often addressed feminist, environmental and socio-political issues. Her work has been internationally exhibited, including in Documenta14 in Kassel, Germany and Athens, at Chisenhale Gallery, London, Kunstlerhaus Bethanien, Berlin, Harbourfront, Toronto, the 18th Street Arts Centre, Los Angeles, USA and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, Korea. Ely's experimental artworks are in international collections, such as the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, and has been selected for significant contemporary art events such as Fieldwork, the opening of the Ian Potter Centre for Australian Art, Federation Square, Melbourne. She has also produced three public sculptures for the City of Hue, Vietnam (1998, 2002, 2006). Art career Ely's first exhibition was in London in 1972, but recognition of her artwork in Australia effectively started at the Mildura Sculpture Triennial of 1975. Her interdisciplinary installation, C20th Mythological Beasts: at Home with the Locust People (1975) had its beginnings in New York where Bonita Ely lived from 1973 to 1975. Her performances of the 1970s and 1980s were concerned primarily with environmental and political issues. For instance in her performance, Jabiluka UO2, [1979] she explored issues surrounding Aboriginal Land Rights and uranium mining in the Northern Territory. In her work Breadline (1980) themes of womanhood and pregnancy were examined. Ely cast and moulded shapes of her body in bread dough which she washed off in a bath of milk. During this action bread was baked then served to viewers after the performance. As a complex exploration of women's traditional roles, the performance is both a celebration of motherhood and nurture, and a critique of woman as a consumable product of culture. Murray River Punch (1980) is one of Ely's most well known and significant performances. The work was first performed at Melbourne University's George Paton Gallery in June 1980 as part of a week of performance titled Women at Work. In this work the artist set up a cooking demonstration in the university's Student Union foyer at lunchtime and assumed the role of a cooking demonstrator who narrates the recipe for a ‚Äòpunch‚Äô drink, the ingredients coming from pollutants in the Murray River. The Murray River, one of the world's longest rivers (2,700 km) has been an enduring focus of her practice, most recently addressing its declining health during the Millennium Drought when environmentally unsustainable agricultural practices exacerbated acid sulphate contamination and outbreaks of blue green algae. Bonita Ely's forensic research along the length of the river resulted in a photographic series titled 'The Murray's Edge'. A reprise of 'Murray River Punch' with the subtitle, 'the C21st', produced a tasty (not) dip due to a scarcity of water, the ingredients all the pollutants in the river. In Dogwoman Communicates with the Younger Generation (1981), and Dogwoman Makes History (1983), the anthropomorphised fascination with another species was documented, alongside the gendered construction of history, using images of dogs in the art of Berlin museums, documented whilst artist in residence at Kunstlerhaus Bethanien, Berlin. In 1998 Bonita Ely was invited to create a public sculpture for the Children's Cultural Centre in Hue, Vietnam, participating in the 2nd Sculpture Symposium. Her interactive work takes the form of a hollow haystack, referencing the conical stacks made of rice 'hay' in the fields around Hue that were used for cooking fires, not animal feed. The sculpture's three arch shaped entrances are approximately one metre high, children's height, and its barrel shaped base acts like an acoustic chamber, collecting the sounds in the environment surrounding it. Small holes in the conical space above illumine the interior with soft bands of light. The sculpture is made from the small, traditional bricks from the Citadel's brickworks. As such it is a record of bygone cultural materials & practices. Research of Hue's longevity characters informed another public sculpture in Hue titled \\"Longevity: Scissors and Sickles\\" (2002). Scissors and sickles made by local blacksmiths were caste and braised together in a lattice pattern to form a three dimensional interpretation of a longevity symbol. Shaped like a gourd, the scrap metal used included shrapnel from the American War, as the Vietnamese call it. In 2006 Bonita was invited back for Hue's 4th International Sculpture Symposium, where her sculpture glows in the dark using solar paint ‚Äì a sceptre of the Earth's energies at night. The title, \\"Lake Thunder\\" brings the sculpture's site, Thuy Tien Lake, into focus as an essential aspect of the work. The conjunction of lake and thunder also refers to traditional Taoist philosophical principals: \\"THUNDER stands for our true essence, LAKE stands for our true sense, WATER stands for our real knowledge, and FIRE stands for our conscious knowledge. These four are the true 'four forms' inherent in us.\\" [from the Inner Teachings of Taoism, Chang Po-Tuan, Shambala Books, 1986] This zig zag symbol, warning of the danger of electricity, began its permutations in a three part installation, \\"We Live to be Surprised\\" in Performance Space, Sydney in 1991. Nine red thunderbolts shoot out of the floor. In the space opposite, 'snabbits' - genetically engineered creatures combining the snail's legless body and rabbit's head - hide in ruins. They are the only living creatures left on Earth. A short story tells us they are an excellent source of food in the future's dystopian environments as they cannot escape and are delicious. Between the thunderbolts and the snabbits' habitat, viewers pass through a corridor of golden light, a liminal space between energy and entropy. In 2010 Bonita Ely was selected to create a public artwork to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of Sydney's Green Olympics. Made from a recycled windmill, the 'Thunderbolt' is powered by solar energy, the sculpture's lighting signals to the community their level of energy consumption in the neighborhood at night, changing colour from green to yellow to red. These environmental works are informed by Ely's cross cultural research of our relationship to land, first tracing the narratives inscribed upon natural landscapes in Australia's Aboriginal mythologies, or song lines, that weave across tribal nations' countries, functioning as ethical, spiritual, and practical narratives used to navigate across complex terrain, embedding environmental knowledges essential for food gathering, hunting, reading the seasons, the winds, etc. Similarly in India's Hindu mythologies, Chinese and Japanese gardens, Europe's pre-Christian animistic belief systems, the landscape was/is inscribed with meaning. The installation, \\"Juggernaut\\" , shown in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Asian Biennale of Contemporary Art, Dhaka, Bangladesh (1999), evoked this inscription of terrain. Each giant, spiralling turn transforms its internal spatial form, its peripatetic force simultaneous to a sense of fragility - the giant spirals are kept in place with wedges at floor level and spacers held in tension between each turn of the spiral, so the sculpture's structural integrity is in 'suspended animation'. Bonita Ely's recent installations exhibited in Documenta14, 2017, are 'Interior Decoration' in the Palais Bellevue in Kassel, Germany, and in Athens, 'Plastikus Progressus'. 'Interior Decoration' investigates the inter- generational effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). ‚ÄúPTSD typically leads to emotional numbing, ‚Ä¶ recurrent nightmares, substance abuse (traditionally, alcoholism), ‚Ä¶ delusional outbursts of violence.‚Äù (Goldstein, 2001). The installation, 'Interior Decoration' is embedded into the domestic environment of the Palais Bellevue. It explores the inter generational effects of untreated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suffered, for example, by war veterans, refugees, Indigenous people, displaced people, victims of genocide. Constructed from domestic objects, the military is domesticated, the domestic militarised. For example, 'Sewing Machine Gun' is made from the conjunction of a Singer sewing machine, a woman's industry, bobbypins, her intimate femininity, to create a Vickers machine gun, problematising the encodings of these objects to present the viewer with emotionally charged conundrums reflective of complexities rather than a didactic illustration of gendered conflict. Similarly the bedroom furniture turned inside-out forms polished wooden tunnel-like trenches, hiding places, all surveyed by the ladder-less 'Watchtower', made from a marriage bed, its floor the wire springs of a child's cot mattress. The installation embeds the viewer in the uncanny feelings of an adult transported back to childhood, inviting exploration to uncover its multiplicities. The sculptural components are contextualised by a dado around the room composed of a visual narrative addressing trauma, and the names of Kassel's Jewish people deported and killed during WW2. Their names are inscribed on a section of railway tracks at the KulturBahnhof (Kassel Central Station), an installation by Dr. Horst Hoheisel, 'Das Ged√§chtnis der Gleise' (2015) - 'The Memory of the Tracks'. 'Interior Decoration' is a reminder of PTSD as a ubiquitous yet under acknowledged cause of conflict and suffering in social and personal relations. The installation, 'Plastikus Progressus' in the Athens iteration of Documenta14 is exhibited in the Athens School of Fine Arts Gallery. It addresses the contribution of casual littering to the plastic pollution of the trans-ecology of water. Set in the year 2054, it takes the form of a natural history display. A diorama features plastic eating creatures, their physiologies built on vacuum cleaners & the parts thereof the artist found discarded on Sydney's streets. The creatures have been genetically engineered using the CRISPR method to clean up the plastics polluting oceans and rivers. The diorama is contextualised by photographs of pristine nature as it would have been in 1905, the year bakelite was invented, plus case studies of rivers in Athens, Kassel and Sydney, 2017, showing plastic pollution off city streets floating towards the ocean, contextualised by a world history from 2000BC to 2054AD showing the emergence, dominance then decline of nations, ending in 2054 with plastic filled, swirling gyres. Each genetically modified creature is described in a taxonomy presented on a touch screen. For example, the taxonomy of the creature called Hells Angel - Classification: Inferna angelus : Common name, Hells Angel; Œ¨Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒøœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ∫œåŒªŒ±œÉŒ∑œÇ [√°ngelos tis k√≥lasis] ‚Äì Reptile, (tortoise). Symbolising longevity, living up to 150 years and more, the tortoise in many Eastern cultures is also known as the Black Warrior, hence the appellation, Hells Angel. Named for the motor cycle macho men whose expertise at sand drag racing hardly mirrors the slow gait of the species, averaging 0.27 km/hr, other characteristics reflect quite accurately the ultra masculine, whichever its gender Their black protective shell resembles Shogun head gear, with tiny horn shaped vodka bottle receptors that send low sound vibrations to the Hells Angel's eardrums. The legs of the reptile from which they evolved are the sound receptors. The Hells Angel has a long protruding tail in which its exclusive diet of plastic flowers is digested and stored, much like a fuel tank. Ironically the females are usually larger than the males. Their brain is small with no hippocampus, which anatomically enables behaviors such as emotion, learning, memory and spatial navigation. They are known to have survived after decapitation for up to 6 months. See http://plastikus.online Unfortunately an 'off target' outcome of the genetic engineering process has been the creation of plastic plants, which many of the creatures, such as the Hells Angel, prefer to eat rather than our disgusting plastic waste. The humour in Ely's artworks draws the viewer into a deep engagement with the concerns of her practice. References J.S.

She is currently Professor of Architecture, Dean and Head of the School of Architecture at the University of Queensland. Career Sandra Kaji-O'Grady has played an extensive role in architectural academia and tertiary education in Australia. She was Head of School at UTS (2005‚Äì2009), Professor and Head of Discipline at the University of Sydney (2011) and has been Professor, Head of School and Dean of Architecture at the University of Queensland since 2013. She currently sits on the editorial boards of Architecture and Culture, Studies in Material Thinking and Architecture Theory Review. Kaji-O'Grady resigned as Head of School from the University of Sydney \\"after the dean of architecture, design and planning, John Redmond, sent letters to more than 100 students at other universities guaranteeing them a place if they switched preferences to Sydney University ‚Äì contravening anti- solicitation rules.\\" Almost the entire department supported her in demanding the dean's resignation. Kaji-O'Grady co-directed, with architect John de Manincor, the 2013 National Conference of the Australian Institute of Architects. The conference, entitled Material, explored architecture's embrace of new materials and \\"expand the discourse on materiality beyond phenomena and affect to explore political, environmental and technological concerns.\\" Kaji-O'Grady and De Manincor assembled a diverse assemblage of speakers, \\"from Matthias Kohler's research into robotics, to Kathrin Aste's sublime interventions in steel and concrete, to Cesare Peeren's radical approach to upcycling.\\" The 2013 conference was also notable for ensuring a gender-balance in speakers at the architecture conference. Kaji-O'Grady writes that her co- director John de Manincor constructed a colourful spreadsheet that allowed them \\"to organize potential speakers according to material sub-theme, nationality and geographical reach of projects, scale of practice and, of course, gender.\\" Research Sandra Kaji-O'Grady's research interests include contemporary laboratory buildings and the cross-fertilization between architecture, science and art in the 1960s and 1970s. She was also part of the Australian Research Council-funded research project Equity and Diversity in the Australian Architecture Profession: Women, Work, and Leadership, led by Naomi Stead of the University of Queensland. One outcome of this research is publishing platform Parlour, which \\"brings together research, informed opinion and resources on women, equity and architecture in Australia.\\" Kaji-O'Grady writes that the \\"project began with the observation that while women are statistically more likely to leave the profession and significantly less likely to reach the upper echelons of architectural practice than men, there was wildly divergent representation of women across different practices.\\" Sandra Kaji-O'Grady, as part of Parlour, has made a significant impact on the Australian architectural profession by providing \\"employers, employees and industry bodies with a tool kit for addressing inequity in the workplace,\\" such as the informal promotion system that tends to favour males. Kaji-O'Grady is a member of the ATCH (Architecture Theory Criticism History) Research Centre, at the University of Queensland. Writing Kaji-O'Grady has written extensively for both academic and popular journals, including The Journal of Architecture, Journal of Architectural Education, Architecture Theory Review, Architecture Australia, Architectural Review Australia, Artichoke, Object Magazine and Monument. She made a significant contribution to Australian architectural theory in the publication Conditions, Connections and Change: Reviewing Australian Architectural Theory 1880‚Äì2000, which she co-authored with Julie Willis.

Barrows (born August 8, 1946, in Detroit, Michigan) is a biologist who earned his BS in Botany and Zoology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1968, and his PhD in entomology, mentored by Charles Duncan Michener, at the University of Kansas, Lawrence in 1975. Further, he is a retired U.S. Army officer. He has had a lifetime interest in nature, science, and art. He performed research on bee nesting, predation, and reproductive behavior, for example, finding that female Lasioglossum zephyrus sweat bees have individual odors perceived by conspecific males. This was evidently the first discovery of invertebrate individual odors, as opposed to group or nest odors. He later found that males of the Xylocopa virginica virginica (large carpenter bee) have highly complex mate searching and mate-acquisition behaviors, perhaps more complicated that any other bee species and many other animal species. Students and he studied feeding behavior and recovery from injuries in Mimus polyglottos (northern mockingbirds). With students and established scientists, he studied or is studying arthropod community structure in a rare, freshwater, tidal, marsh, and associated habitats, (About Dyke Marsh Wildlife Preserve, VA) evolution of floral display in Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed), parasitization and reproductive behavior of chalcidoid wasps, floral associates of rare plants, and other topics. His research in scientific communication led to the book Animal Desk Reference, A Dictionary of Animal Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution (3rd edition). His current research laboratory, the Laboratory of Entomology and Biodiversity, is in the Heyden Observatory of Georgetown University. He has written popular- style nature articles, for example, for The Kansas City Star and The Washington Star and The Echo (the Glen Echo, Maryland, town newsletter). In his popular-style book Nature, Gardens, and Georgetown (2006), he described biodiversity and changes in the natural environment at Georgetown University and nearby places. At the college level, he taught animal behavior, botany, entomology, earth stewardship, forest ecology, history of life, and sociobiology at Georgetown University, University of Kansas, and University of Michigan. He has been a professor in the Department of Biology at Georgetown, since 1975, where he mentored many undergraduate senior-thesis students, MS, and PhD students. His honors include being an honorary life-member of a premier conservation organization Friends of Dyke Marsh, a long-term research associate of the Smithsonian Institution, an Engelhard Teaching Fellow, a National Defense Education Act Fellow, an elected president of the Entomological Society of Washington, elected officer of the Glen Echo Heights Citizens' Association, an elected member of the Washington Biologists‚Äô Field Club (WBFC), and appointment as a member of the American Institute of Biological Sciences Council, and the Director of the Center for the Environment and the Director of Environmental Education at Georgetown University.

Description and history River Legend, designed by American artist Dimitri Hadzi, is a basalt sculpture installed outside the Edith Green ‚Äì Wendell Wyatt Federal Building in downtown Portland. It was commissioned for $65,000 in the 1970s by the General Services Administration's Art-in-Architecture Program and completed in September 1976. The allegorical sculpture (\\"rivers\\") measures x x , according to the Smithsonian Institution, or approximately x x , according to the General Services Administration. The arch is made of Columbia Basin basalt and named after a natural crossing that spanned the Columbia River and allowed tribes to interact, according to Native American lore. Hadzi has specifically referred to the former land bridge called Bridge of the Gods near Cascade Locks, and has also said the piece represents \\"man's power over nature and the taming of the wilderness\\". Originally, he intended to cast a bronze sculpture, but changed his mind after viewing natural geological formations along the Columbia River Gorge. The General Services Administration refers to the sculpture as a \\"monumental stone arch\\", while The Oregonian describes River Legend as a \\"street-level, dark- hued arch, made edgy by blond spiky protrusions around one segment\\". Plaque for the sculpture Despite being publicly financed, the sculpture was initially hidden from general public view because the Edith Green ‚Äì Wendell Wyatt Federal Building's original architect believed the arch competed with the building's design. It was installed on the building's plaza and was visible to occupants and visitors, but not from the street. Hadzi constructed a full-size cardboard replica to illustrate to the architect how it would look outside the building; according to Hadzi, the architect eventually realized \\"it was a mistake not to have [the sculpture] up front\\". The arch's five sections were originally built on-site by the artist. According to the General Services Administration, he \\"worked the surface of the stones with a variety of treatments and carefully pinned and fitted the sections together with minimal joinery\\". River Legend was relocated to the exterior in 2013 after the Edith Green ‚Äì Wendell Wyatt Federal Building underwent a major renovation. According to the Smithsonian Institution, the work remains administered by General Services Administration's Art-in-Architecture Program. Though not currently on display, the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection includes a maquette of River Legend. The cast bronze maquette measures 11 1/8 x 15 x 7 in. (28.1 x 38.0 x 17.9 cm) and is set on a marble base. Reception The sculpture in 2018 In his review for The Oregonian, Len Reed said the sculpture \\"seemed to offer relief, as if it were a jolt of reckless nature amid all the glass and concrete and metal. It seemed at once ancient and modern. It seemed to hold a secret.\\" Furthermore, he said: > River Legend may be decades old, but its energy is all new and very, very > public. Whether the pleasure it produces is encoded in cells or the result > of some mysterious learning doesn't really matter. The ancient rock soars. > That's true even if its nifty fins are wood shims to prevent a crack from > expanding. Somehow amid moving, storing, and re-siting, a segment of the > columnar basalt let go and requires an injection of epoxy to hold. It > wouldn't be crazy to think of the sculpture for now as a songbird with a leg > splint. Such a small price for a new life.

Thesleff was born in Helsinki, the eldest daughter of five siblings and her father was an amateur painter. She took private lessons and then, in 1887, studied for two years at the Finnish Art Society Drawing School (now known as the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts) with Gunnar Berndtson. In 1891, Tesleff moved to Paris and enrolled into Acad√©mie Colarossi. Thesleff spent all of her life in Finland, France, and Italy, visiting Italy first in 1894. In Finland, she had a family estate at Murole, Ruovesi. She never married. Thesleff took part in many big exhibitions in the 20th century, in particular, in 1949 her paintings were on display on a big exhibition of Nordic art in Copenhagen and were praised by media. At the beginning of her career, Thesleff worked on symbolist paintings in the style similar to Eug√®ne Carri√®re, though she insisted she was most influenced by √âdouard Manet. Later, she moved to expressionism and modernism, most notably landscapes. Thesleff was included in the 2018 exhibit Women in Paris 1850-1900.

Biography Valantine was born in The Gambia and lived in Banjul as a child. When her father was selected as the Gambian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, she and her family moved to London. She studied biochemistry at Chelsea College, London University and graduated from medical school at St. George's Hospital Medical School in 1978. Career After medical school Valantine performed post- graduate work in cardiology at the Brompton Hospital and Hammersmith Hospital in London. She recalls that her decision to enter this field elicited skepticism from colleagues, as only two other women cardiologists worked in the UK at the time. After her residencies in the U.K., she became a fellow at Stanford and worked with Norman Shumway, a pioneer in the field of heart transplants. She became a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine in 1989 and reached full professor rank in 2001. Valantine became SUMC's Senior Associate Dean for Diversity and Faculty Development in 2005. On taking this role, she cited the importance of mentorship and social engagement in developing the careers of young faculty and emphasized her experience as a working mother in shaping her advice to young scientists. During the 2009‚Äì10 academic year, Valantine was a Faculty Research Fellow at Stanford's Clayman Institute for Gender Research. She was selected in 2010 as one of six recipients of NIH Pathfinder Awards, which were intended for the study of women's underrepresentation in biomedical faculty positions in the United States. Valantine describes her pursuit of innovation as the foundation of her professional career - innovation in heart transplant and innovation in efforts to diversify the biomedical research workforce. NIH leadership In 2014, NIH Director Francis Collins announced Valantine's appointment as NIH's first Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity, a new position whose entire focus is diversity in biomedicine. Among her accomplishments in this position is the 2014 award of nearly $31 million to develop methods for outreach and career development targeted toward members of demographic groups underrepresented among professional scientists. Under Valantine's leadership, the racial gap in rates of NIH applications and awards to projects led by African-American researchers has been practically, and in some cases entirely, eliminated, with increases of up to 142% in some award areas. Similar trends are apparent for Hispanic/Latinx scientists. Valantine also developed the NIH Distinguished Scholars Program, which aims to increase diversity among tenure-track researchers in intramural research programs. This program reduces barriers to recruitment of cohorts of principal investigators from underrepresented groups in biomedical research such as people of color, individuals with disabilities, and women. Valantine also leads the Laboratory of Transplantation Genomics at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, focusing on heart transplant rejection.

Lucious is the main protagonist and anti-hero of the series. Created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, Lucious is the founder and CEO of Empire Entertainment, a world-famous and renowned record company that he runs with his family. Realizing he will need a successor after he is diagnosed with ALS, Lucious pits his three sons: the college-educated executive Andre Lyon (Trai Byers), the talented and gay singer-songwriter Jamal (Jussie Smollett), and youngest, rapper Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray), against one another. The story has parallels to William Shakespeare's King Lear and James Goldman's The Lion in Winter. Lyon is married to former drug dealer and ex-con Cookie Lyon (Taraji P. Henson). The company is preparing to go public on the NYSE. However, Lyon must contend with his wife Cookie (Henson) upon her release from prison as she demands her piece of the company. He also struggles with Jamal's sexuality and Hakeem's inability to step up to the plate and show maturity as an artist. At the same time, Lyon neglects Andre, seemingly due to his lack of musical ability. Lyon and Cookie's love for each other further complicates his existing relationship with his head of A&R;, Anika Calhoun (Grace Gealey). The character of Lyon, who starts out selling drugs as a teenager and develops into a well-respected rapper and music mogul, is loosely based on several real-life figures, including rappers, record producers and politicians. Storyline Lucious Lyon was born Dwight Walker. He grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and began selling drugs to support himself at age nine as an orphan, after his father was \\"killed\\" by the Nation of Islam, the details of which have yet to be revealed. He met his future wife, Cookie Holloway, who helped him sell drugs to finance his rap music career. Cookie is eventually arrested and sentenced to prison. Lucious then divorces her and raises their three young sons with the help of Vernon Turner (Malik Yoba) and Cookie's cousin, Bunkie Williams (Antoine McKay). Eventually, Cookie and Lucious remarry later on in the series. After becoming a successful rapper and singer, Lucious uses his drug money to build his own record company, Empire. After announcing his plans to take Empire public, Lucious is informed that he has ALS and is given 3 years to live. He soon becomes engaged to a younger woman and debutante named Anika Calhoun. His position in his company is threatened when Cookie returns from prison after having served her 17-year sentence, which was reduced due to her becoming an FBI informant (unbeknownst to Lucious). Cookie demands that Lucious give her half of Empire and the A&R; position with the knowledge that he used drug money to finance the company. He refuses her demands, but nonetheless hires her on the company board and allows her to be the manager of their son Jamal, claiming that he \\"never wanted\\" him anyway due to his homosexuality. Lucious and Cookie pit Hakeem and Jamal against one another in an effort to prove who has more musical talent and to determine which one will inherit Empire. Meanwhile, Lucious orders Bunkie to spy on Cookie. Bunkie refuses to do so and instead attempts to blackmail him, demanding US$3 million to pay off his gambling debts. Lucious kills Bunkie after meeting with him later near the city docks. He pretends to grieve at Bunkie's funeral, and has his oldest son Andre lie to the police about his location the night of the shooting. Lucious gets Anika's father, a doctor, to sign a false statement of health concerning his ALS. He hires another doctor who secretly provides him with drugs from the black market, informing him that the drugs could possibly cure his ALS. The drugs only exacerbate his condition and he is rushed to the hospital. Once he recovers, he reveals his diagnosis to his family. Lucious and Cookie have a brief affair, which causes Anika to leave him and go to the company of his detested rival, Billy Berretti (Judd Nelson). Lucious discovers that Jamal has a possible daughter named Lola with his ex-wife Olivia (Raven Symone). He also hires security guards to better protect himself and his company. The head of security, Malcolm DeVeaux (Derek Luke), is a former Navy SEAL, whom Cookie flirts with to make Lucious jealous. Despite tensions between Cookie and Lucious over their affair and subsequent breakup, they plan to release a collaborative family album called The Lucious Lyon Legacy Album. Cookie wants the album to feature Lucious, Jamal, and Hakeem as a supergroup, but Lucious decides to cancel it once Jamal comes out as gay to the public during a performance of his father's song, \\"You're So Beautiful.\\" During a company board meeting, Andre tries to gain the position of interim CEO should Lucious become ill or die. When a tie-breaker is needed to decide if Andre gets the position, Lucious votes against his son, later explaining to him in private his disapproval of Andre's interracial marriage to Rhonda (Kaitlin Doubleday). Andre, in turn, stops taking his medication for his bipolar disorder and angrily lashes out at his father during a board meeting, accusing him of being a murderer. Lucious has Andre restrained and sedated, allowing Rhonda to decide to place her husband in psychiatric care. Lucious attempts to restart his relationship with Cookie by hiring her to the now vacant A&R; position, but she turns him down and sleeps with Malcolm. He offers Hakeem's older girlfriend, Camilla (Naomi Campbell) money to pay off her numerous debts in exchange for leaving the country and Hakeem, as he views her as a bad influence on his son. During a family dinner, Olivia's jealous boyfriend Reg breaks into Lucious' house and pulls a gun on Jamal and then Cookie when she intervenes. Lucious tells him that he is Lola's father and that he deserves to die, but Malcolm shoots Reg in the head before he can fire on Lucious. Shortly after Reg's death, Lucious hosts a concert with Snoop Dogg and his son Hakeem, in which Hakeem repeatedly insults his father on stage for his role in getting Camilla to leave the country. Lucious punches his son in retaliation, but Hakeem sleeps with Anika to get revenge. Lucious discovers Cookie's relationship with Malcolm and reveals that he never actually hired her to the company board, and forces her out of her office. Lucious is told by his doctor that he was misdiagnosed with ALS and actually has MG (myasthenia gravis). While he is sleeping, Cookie hears Lucious confess to the murder of Bunkie, and she attempts to smother him with a pillow until Lucious nearly wakes. Overjoyed that he is not dying, Lucious decides to make amends with Hakeem and Andre. He finally recognizes Jamal's musical talent and realizes that he should lead Empire, making him the CEO. Lucious finally takes the company to the NYSE. In a celebration concert, Lucious is arrested for the murder of Bunkie. As he is escorted to jail, he believes Cookie informed the police of Bunkie's murder only to realize it was Vernon Turner. Creation and development Creator Lee Daniels took influence from his own father in creating the character: \\"Lucious is a lot of my dad.\\" Daniels also drew inspiration from several well respected men in the music industry including \\"Berry Gordy to Gamble and Huff to Jay Z to Puffy to Quincy Jones.\\" Howard described himself as \\"megalomaniac\\" to which Lee Daniels responded, \\"The character's a megalomaniac.\\" Howard replied in turn, \\"You need to be a megalomaniac to play a megalomaniac.\\" When they started production, Howard thought to play Lucious with his \\"head down or be softhearted about something,\\" but Daniels stated that \\"Lucious owns the world.\\" Howard said the first few episodes are basically him doing an impersonation of Daniels. Howard also drew on inspiration from the 1972 film, The Godfather. \\"[Lucious] wants to be Michael Corleone, but sometimes he's stuck at being Sonny.\\" Lucious does his best to \\"get rid of his emotions,\\" Howard said. However, his emotions always sneak up on him and \\"keep him human.\\" Howard had some admiration for his character. \\"I love that Lucious is unapologetic about who he is\\" and that he has a \\"backbone of pure determination.\\" However, Howard said what rubs him the wrong way about Lucious is his \\"inability to connect with the people that really mean the most to him.\\" In an interview Howard said \\"for me to play a character that is Archie Bunker, or really the rest of America unmasked, Lucious says exactly how he feels when he feels it... And despite who's watching because he has five billion dollars and doesn't need anybody's approval.\\" Howard is allowed to play someone who is \\"brutally, objectively and subjectively honest, in every circumstance.\\" =Casting and portrayal= On February 19, 2014, it was announced that Academy Award-nominated actor Terrence Howard had been in cast in the role of Lucious Lyon, the head of Empire Entertainment, which he is about to take public. Howard had recently appeared in Lee Daniels and Danny Strong's 2013 film The Butler. On taking the role, Howard explained that there is no longer a \\"distinction\\" between the stage, film or television. He had done movies, but stated that \\"the work I find on this show is more challenging than 90 percent of the roles in film, and that's what you want as an artist.\\" Those challenges helped Howard grow as an artist. Daniels admitted that he did have another actor besides Terrence Howard in mind for the role, and initially refused to disclose the actor's name. He later admitted that the other actor was Wesley Snipes, but Taraji P. Henson, who had already been in talks with the producers to play Cookie, suggested her former co-star Howard for the role. Otherwise, Henson would have declined her role. Howard and Henson worked together on the 2005 independent film, Hustle & Flow, for which Howard received his Academy Award nomination. \\"He had to be incredibly charming and charismatic and likable,\\" Danny Strong said of any actor playing Lucious. While Henson recommended Howard because she thought he \\"classed up this whole hip-hop thing,\\" Daniels had not initially been impressed with Howard. Daniels initially thought Howard was \\"too pretty,\\" and accredited the 1998 film Spark with changing his mind about Howard as an actor. But Daniels was still hesitant; \\"I didn't think Terrence was interested in TV.\\" However, Howard said he agreed to the role because he enjoyed working with Daniels on The Butler. \\"Anywhere you go, I'm going,\\" Howard told Daniels. After Howard first read the script, he was very skeptical of the show and its portrayal of homosexuality. He initially referred to the script as \\"crap\\" and said that he wasn't sure how \\"ready the world was\\" to be shown \\"two black men kissing.\\" Howard later admitted that he was \\"so wrong,\\" saying that \\"[The homophobic environment]'s the environment I grew up in. That's the environment my friends grew up in. So this is a show aimed towards the black demographic. And do you really think that this is going to fly?\\" Howard even personally called Fox and told them, \\"'You need to take the kissing out, because this is going to stop, shut down the show.\\" In response to the controversy surrounding his casting and whether he should have been excluded from the project because of his alleged past, Howard said \\"I hope that nothing will take away from the truly special project we all worked so hard on. I hope people enjoy it because it has been such a wonderful experience working with this cast and Fox.\\" Danny Strong admitted that he was not made aware of Howard's past until several months into the project. Strong said that while he did not condone Howard's alleged past behavior, \\"it is the polar opposite of what I've experienced with him, one-on-one and on set.\\" Producer Brian Grazer put faith in Howard to \\"do right.\\" Howard is a \\"guy that cares a lot... and he's been great with us on our sets, so I can only speak to that,\\" Grazer continued. Fox executive Dana Walden described Howard as \\"a great partner.\\" Walden explained that while it was the choice of the creators to hire Howard, the actor had impressed her and her co-chair Gary Newman. Walden also admitted that she and Newman were not made aware of the allegations until December 2014. By that time, Howard had been working with the network for nearly a year and showed no signs of trouble. =Personality= Homophobia Much like Lee Daniels' own father, Lucious is severely homophobic and extremely unapologetic about it. Daniels revealed that the decision to make Lucious homophobic stemmed from his experiences doing research for Precious. \\"Homophobia is rampant in the African American community\\" Daniels stated. \\"I wanted to blow the lid off more on homophobia in my community,\\" Daniels continued. The openly gay Daniels recalled his father's point of view on his sexuality: \\"You're an African- American man, that's hard enough. You're going to throw gay on top of it? What are you doing? You have a choice. Do you really want to go through [life] like this?\\" \\"What we're doing is telling a little bit of the story of Lee growing up in that way,\\" Terrence Howard said, referring to the scene in which Lucious throws his 4-year-old son Jamal in a trash bin when the boy puts on his mother's heels. That scene was based on Daniels' actual experience with his own father. Howard elaborated on his experience during the scene: \\"Watching Lee while we were shooting this ‚Äî at one point, he had to look away because he was in tears, because he was facing it. His mother was also there on the set. It was cathartic for Lee.\\" Howard continued, \\"Lee would not allow me to show any compassion in the scene. He reminded me how much Lucious loved little Jamal, but my need for the boy to be a strong man was greater than my need to show my love to him. That was a difficult scene.\\" Danny Strong initially did not tell Daniels about the decision to incorporate that part of his life story into the series because he feared Daniels would reject the idea. Howard revealed that his own father was also terribly homophobic and it scared him too. But \\"that's what's taught in most [African-American and Latino] households\\", Howard explained. \\"What we're really trying to do is give people an opportunity to see what they're doing is painful,\\" the actor continued. From Lucious' point of view, as a hip hop mogul, \\"He is supposed to be the epitome of a 'man' in the black community. He's raising three [strong] sons.\\" Lucious feels that Jamal's homosexuality detracts from that powerful image. When asked about the reason for the character's homophobia, show runner Ilene Chaiken said, \\"The why isn't something we've asked because I don't think there is a why.\\" It just is. It could be \\"generational\\" and \\"cultural\\" or it could just be his personal beliefs, \\"but it's not surprising that it would be his point of view,\\" Chaiken responded. \\"We don't talk about there being a specific incident in his life that made him homophobic,\\" because usually there isn't one. According to Chaiken, creators Lee Daniels and Danny Strong viewed Lucious' homophobia as \\"[T]he most important storyline.\\" They went on to state: \\"It‚Äôs central. We want to continue to play it, and play it with authenticity and roughness. We don‚Äôt want to soften it in any way.\\" By the end of Season one, Lucious is able to put his homophobia aside for the greater good of Empire. Jussie Smollett said of Lucious' evolution and eventual acceptance of Jamal's sexuality, \\"[W]here you meet Jamal and Lucious in the pilot is not where Jamal and Lucious end up. There's a journey, a certain level of growth, and that's the truth of humanity.\\" Smollett clarified that Lucious' evolution was not a complete reversal of his beliefs, but rather, a step in the right direction: \\"It's not to say that Lucious is going to be this incredible parent that supports his kid and goes and stands on the sidelines of gay marches, but it does mean that we're holding up a mirror and being like, \\"Lucious, if those are your points of view, as odd and jaded and bullshit as they are, if those are your points of view, the least you can do ‚Äî the least you can do ‚Äî is respect your child.\\" Co-creator Danny Strong said of the character's growth, \\"Lucious has had the most profound arc of the season when it comes to his understanding and acceptance of his son's sexuality, and it was sort of one of the driving ideas of the season thematically with addressing homophobia in a way that was honest.\\" ALS diagnosis When Lucious is diagnosed with ALS in the pilot, he starts to realize that he was not a great parent because he was so focused on \\"making the money.\\" Howard said, \\"I'm approaching it from that place of missed time and trying desperately\\" to make use of the time he has left. While Howard does not have personal experience with the disease, he focused in on the \\"fear\\" that comes with such a disease. \\"There is a fear of what's about to happen\\" Howard said. The character's longevity immediately comes into question due to the diagnosis. However, Danny Strong refused to comment on how the disease would affect Lucious in future seasons. Strong danced around answering the question about the fatality of Lucious' diagnosis and said viewers would have to wait and see how the disease would affect Lucious. Though the doctor gives Lucious three years, and maybe even less time, Bustle estimated Lucious would be killed off around the end of season 3. However, the magazine noted that while the disease is incurable, Stephen Hawking who was diagnosed at the age of 21 was now 73 years old. Lucious starts showing symptoms much earlier than the doctor predicts which makes it seems like his life expectancy could be shorter. However, Bustle argued against the potential of the character's death sooner rather than later because Howard is the lead of the show. Dr. Aletha Maybank said \\"even though shows like Empire are filled with climatic levels of drama, it has elevated the conversation around a disease that has historically been showed behind the curtain by thrusting it into the lights of primetime.\\" Ilene Chaiken discussed having Lucious come clean about his condition sooner rather than keeping the secret until the following season. In the Season one finale, Lucious discovers that he doesn't have ALS; rather, he has the treatable but still debilitating myasthenia gravis. Brian Moylan of The Guardian found Lucious' misdiagnosis to be a mistake on the part of the writers and creators, saying that it made the plot of the show \\"meaningless.\\" He went on to say that the ALS diagnosis was a \\"brave\\" decision that the writers \\"snatched away.\\" He claimed that the misdiagnosis \\"shows the audience that the bold choices this show makes have no real consequences. When they can find an easy way to brush off a serious disease such as ALS, what else will be swatted away when it becomes inconvenient to the writers? Is Andre's bipolar disorder going to be cured too?\\" However, co-creator Danny Strong revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that he had always intended for Lucious to have been misdiagnosed with ALS: \\"Lucious being misdiagnosed was in my original pitch. Lee and I pitched the show to four different networks, and it was always in the pitch that he was going to think he had ALS, but toward the end of the first season, he‚Äôs going to find out he was misdiagnosed. I‚Äôve heard a few stories about that; my ex-girlfriend‚Äôs father was misdiagnosed with ALS, but also my grandfather had an autoimmune disease that crippled him but then it just reversed itself.\\" Strong stated that the misdiagnosis was believable because \\"ALS is...a very hard disease to diagnose.\\" =Relationships= According to Ilene Chaiken, Lucious is all about \\"what he wants in the moment.\\" Cookie is \\"the one\\" for Lucious. Chaiken praised the chemistry between Howard and Henson but also gave credit to Daniels and Strong for creating the \\"extraordinary connection\\" between the two characters. Michael Slezak questioned whether Lucious and Cookie getting along would work in the long term because they are \\"fun adversaries.\\" Chaiken said the writers were well aware that their reunion would come, but had a plan in place once it did. Chaiken said \\"we know where we're going and it's complicated.\\" Howard explained that Lucious and Cookie have a mutual love for one another. Howard insisted that Lucious loves Jamal and only wants the best for him. \\"So when he has this one son who's shown some homosexual tendencies as a child ‚Äì [as a father] you're always kind of watchful, [wondering] why is Timmy over here playing with the dolls for so long?\\" Lucious identifies the \\"problem\\" early on and does what he deems necessary to get rid of those tendencies. \\"That's what father do. They take all of these kind of steps and precautions to make sure that any tendency that goes feminine, you try to nip that in the bud\\" Howard explained. Despite his disapproval over Jamal's sexuality, Lucious is able to give Jamal advice and some sort of comfort when his career starts taking off causing Jamal's boyfriend to leave him. \\"Lucious... talking to Jamal about how hard it is to be with an artist is a really authentic moment.\\" It's also one of the first times the share a bonding moment. When Jamal finally stands up to Lucious, Howard said Lucious never tried to \\"crush\\" the \\"greatness that's in [Jamal].\\" Instead, \\"Lucious always pushed it.\\" Howard explained and Lee Daniels agreed that had Lucious not been so harsh with his son at home, \\"Jamal may not have survived\\" where they grew up. Thanks to Lucious, \\"Jamal learned what the devil looked like.\\" One doesn't grow from having \\"safe haven,\\" Howard insisted. Reception Much like his character, Howard is no stranger to controversy. Some disapproved of his hiring due to his past allegations of domestic violence and suggested that Howard be removed from the project. That same year, NBC ended its partnership with Bill Cosby due to the allegations of sexual assault against him. Clover Hope of The Muse viewed Lucious in the pilot as a \\"straight-up villain\\" that would have to overcome very \\"tragic flaws\\" to be deemed \\"likable.\\" She continued, \\"The writers have so far succeeded in making [Lucious] one of the most compelling characters on television, and they're on the verge of pulling off another : making Terrence Howard likable.\\" While the role comes off as a continuation of Howard's Hustle & Flow character, Jeff Jensen praised Howard's portrayal. \\"Helped by his doleful visage, tender voice, and soulful air, Howard keeps us caring about Lucious even as he reveals his monstrous shades.\\" Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times described Howard's portrayal as \\"silky and understated.\\" Mark Blankenstop praised the writers for humanizing Lucious in \\"Our Dancing Days\\". Blankenstop said, \\"while the show doesn't forget this man is a villain ‚Äì he did kill his best friend, remember ‚Äì it also allows him to be a romantic who can actually love at least one person.\\" He also praised Howard's portrayal of Lucious' love for Cookie. \\"I buy that Lucious really does feel things about [Cookie] that don't involve platinum plaques\\" he continued. \\"The very thing one hates about Lucious is the thing one likes most about him\\" Jozen Cummings from Billboard when she ranked Lucious at No. 3 out of 7 characters, based on likability. Lucious has received comparisons to other TV antiheroes such as Tony Soprano, Walter White, Omar Little, and Don Draper. Scott Mendelson of Forbes said of the character, \\"Like the classic television anti-heroes of TV's so-called \\"golden age,\\" Mr. Lyon operates as both the show's would-be hero and its most obvious villain. The character of Lucious Lyon arguably offers one of the first non-white variations on the now-standard television anti-hero.\\" Lucious has been criticized for being a bad CEO and an even worse father. Zack O'Malley Greenburg said that Lucious' \\"intolerance\\" and \\"deep prejudice\\" inhibit him from making good decisions for the betterment of his company. Keertana Sastry of Bustle referred to Lucious as \\"a terrible boss\\" and \\"a terrible father,\\" and thought that Cookie and Anika would be better suited to the CEO position. Craig D. Lindsey agreed, saying that Lucious is \\"a terrible father, a horrible businessman, and just a despicable, downright sociopathic person.\\" Hettie Williams of The Huffington Post stated that Lucious is a \\"black caricature\\" who perpetuated the stereotype of the \\"black brute.\\" She continued, \\"Lucious is a brute to his family in that he harshly places his young son Jamal into a trash can for his effeminate ways (Jamal tries on a dress in his youth) to teach him a lesson about how to \\"man-up;\\" refuses to attend a therapy session with his son Dre; and apparently...sleeps with his own daughter-in-law.\\" However, Arienne Thompson disagreed, and found Lucious interesting as a \\"love-to-hate\\" character who embodied the best and worst qualities of all of TV's past anti-heroes and villains. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly proclaimed that although \\"Lucious was forced to be the single parent, he did it badly, wounding his three sons in myriad ways while he chased worldly significance.\\" Despite castigating Lucious for being a bad parent, Jensen thought that the character had depth to him due to Howard's impressive portrayal, saying that \\"Lucious may as well have been an absent dad, though in truth, he's just like too many so-called present fathers, distracted and remote. Howard effortlessly embodies the character's hypocrisies and imbues him with a palpable emotional life without sanding off his alienating edge.\\" References External links *Lucious Lyon at the Internet Movie Database Category:Empire (2015 TV series) Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional drug dealers Category:Fictional guitarists Category:Fictional singers Category:Fictional amputees Category:Fictional rappers Category:Fictional business executives Category:Fictional characters from Philadelphia Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 Category:American male characters in television ","title":"Lucious Lyon"},{"id":"45615777","text":"Shishir Anil Bhavane (born 24 September 1991) is an Indian cricketer who plays for Karnataka cricket team.

Early life  Jeanna Bauck was born in 1840. She was the daughter of a German- born composer and music critic Carl Wilhelm Bauck (1808‚Äì1877) and a Swedish mother, Dorothea Fredrique (1806‚Äì1834). She had another sister, Hanna Lucia Bauck, and two older brothers, Emanuel Bauck, and Johannes Bauck. Jeanna was raised in Stockholm. She remained in Sweden until 1863, at which time she moved to Germany to study painting, first in Dresden and then in Munich where she met the Danish portrait painter Bertha Wegmann. The two became life-long friends, living together, sharing a studio, and travelling to Italy and Paris, where they lived a number of years before returning to Munich.  Early career  Her art education began under Adolf Ehrhardt in Dresden, then under Albert Flamm in D√ºsseldorf, then Joseph Brandt in Munich. The majority of her landscape training was in Munich as well, under the tutelage of Academy- trained painter Johann Diedrich Christian Langko, who was notably inspired throughout his career by the Barbizon school of painting. Most of the paintings produced throughout Bauck‚Äôs career, like those of her teacher, are classified within the Barbizon style. Bauck began her career painting almost exclusively landscapes, and found moderate success doing so. She later expanded into portrait painting, and by the late 1890s was producing equal amounts of both. During the course of her career she won awards at exhibitions both within Germany and abroad, and was at various times represented by galleries in Stockholm and Trieste.  Later life  In 1880, Bauck moved to Paris and shared a studio with her friend Bertha Wegmann. During this time Bauck painted a portrait of Wegmann titled The Danish Artist Bertha Wegmann Painting a Portrait, and Wegmann painted, among some twenty other portraits, her well-known portrait of Bauck, M√•larinnan Jeanna Bauck. Also during their time in Paris, both Bauck and Wegmann showed works in the Paris Salons of 1881 and 1882. She showed works at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and her paintings Woodland Lake and Portrait of a man were included in the 1905 book Women Painters of the World.Women painters of the world, from the time of Caterina Vigri, 1413‚Äì1463, to Rosa Bonheur and the present day, by Walter Shaw Sparrow, The Art and Life Library, Hodder & Stoughton, 27 Paternoster Row, London, 1905Jeanna Bauck as a \\"German painter\\" at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and Exposition. By 1897, Bauck was living in Berlin and teaching painting night classes at the Association of Berlin Arts. It is here that she met and later befriended a student, then twenty-one year old Paula Modersohn-Becker, who would later describe Bauck as having been her favorite teacher. Becker would go on to become a highly influential early-expressionist painter. In 1926 Jeanna Bauck died in Munich, Germany, at age 85.

Early life Born in Te Puke on 12 July 1946, White grew up in Epsom, a suburb of Auckland, the youngest of seven children. Her father, Albert Tikitu White, was a builder and World War I veteran of NgƒÅti Awa descent. Education White completed a Diploma of Fine Arts at Elam School of Fine Arts in 1967. Along with her contemporaries Richard Killeen and Ian Scott, White was taught by Colin McCahon at Elam and has cited him as an important influence on her development and commitment as an artist. Career After art school, White moved to Bottle Creek, Paremata, in 1969, and taught art at Mana College. Here White taught herself to screenprint, motivated by a desire to make her art more accessible and affordable. She has frequently reproduced her oil paintings as prints, such as Mangaweka (1973) in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. While at Bottle Creek, White befriended local writers including Sam Hunt, Fleur Adcock, Alistair Te Ariki Campbell, and historian Michael King. Art historian Jill Trevelyan notes that it was while living at Bottle Creek that White developed her characteristic style, as she 'began to paint the local landscape using crisp, rhythmic outlines, strong light, and flat blocks of colours'. White became well known for these works, which often depicted scenes of small town life, such as flat-bed trucks and fish and chip shops. White is also a member of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith. In 1972 White moved to Portobello, near Dunedin, where she met her husband, also a member of the religion. In 1982 White and her family moved to the Republic of Kiribati, living on the island of Tarawa and working with the Baha'i community. Here she continued to make art, working almost entirely in woodcut prints as materials for this method were the most readily available. White returned to New Zealand in 1999 and is now based in Masterton, where she continues to work with weavers and artists from around the Pacific. In 2011 White was one of nine New Zealand and Australian artists selected to take part in the 'Kermadecs' research trip and exhibition project, organised by the Pew Research Center. White's collaborative exhibition of monumental ngatu (painted tapa) works, made with Tongan artist Ruha Fifita and a group of Tongan women, showed at Pataka Art + Museum in 2014. White has represented New Zealand at a number of international exhibitions including the sixth International Biennale of Sydney and the first Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art in Brisbane. In 2009 she was featured in the sixth Asia- Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art.  Notable works  * Mangaweka, 1973. Oil on canvas, 1016 √ó 1016 mm.

In 2009, following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government, she accepted redesignation as a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. In 2012, White received a University of Auckland Distinguished Alumni Award in 2012, and an Arts Foundation of New Zealand Laureate Award in 2017.

She attended the Ohrid High School (rather than her local school in her hometown Struga), and her family financed the first three years of her studies in Belgrade, the post second World War capital of the Federation of Yugoslavia, until she received a scholarship. She completed her architectural studies with the major project on ‚ÄòUrban resolution for the touristic district Trsija in Ohrid,‚Äô under the supervision of Professor Branko Maksimovic in Belgrade. This sense of a world open for her education and learning became a pattern in Nestorova-Tomiƒá career and she travelled widely. Early work The architectural career of Mimoza Nestorova-Tomiƒá is summarized in the first volume of the 2004 encyclopedic publication –ì—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏—Ç–µ –≤–æ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞ (City Builders in Macedonia), which covers the pioneering period of architectural production in the Republic of Macedonia. The author and editor of the publication, well known architect Georgi Konstantinovski, has structured the book such that each individual architect is represented on a double page spread, no matter their hierarchy or status, illustrating a socialist form of equality in representation. In the period between 1954 and 1962, after a brief period in the office of Drago Galiƒá in Zagreb, Nestorova-Tomiƒá pursued a series of study-related practical training in France (1957) and Britain (1960 funded by British Council), and in 1964 with her husband, Lyubomir Tomiƒá, to the USA (New York, Berkeley, and Chicago). During this time Nestorova-Tomiƒá worked with her husband on the design of the apartment block in Albert Einstein Street, in Skopje. Collaboration In 1964 Nestorova-Tomiƒá joined the Institute of Urbanism and Architecture in Skopje where in a team with architectural conservationists, consultants, and engineers, she worked on the project for the reconstruction and restoration of the Stara Charshija (Old Bazaar), a large area of Ottoman urban morphology, including significant Ottomon architectural edifices, mosques and hamams, on the north side of the Vardar river at the foothills of the Kale Fortress, in Skopje. This was a key component of the reconstruction of Skopje. It was followed with the project on the restoration of the historical Ottoman structure of Sulei Inn. With the team of the architect, Arsovski, Nestorova-Tomiƒá on the department store, ‚ÄòSkopjanka‚Äô in Skopje. One highlight of her career is the design for the Museum of Macedonia (1972, Skopje) for which she collaborated with the architect, Muratovski. Due to its innovative setting on the site within the context of the Stara Charishija, the museum project has been noted in a few publications including, Tokarev‚Äôs book, 100 Years of Modern Architecture, Volume 3: Contributions of Macedonia and Yugoslavia (1918-1990) and Kuliƒá‚Äôs 2011 book on Yugoslavian architecture, Modernism In-Between. Awards In 2011, Nestorova-Tomiƒá was the recipient of the Andreja Damjanov award, a national award given to an individual who has made significant contribution over a sustained period. Nestorova-Tomiƒá has been a model architectural figure in the Republic of Macedonia. In the first volume of Konstantinovski‚Äôs encyclopaedic publication, one of the very few publications on Macedonian architects, Mimoza Nestorova-Tomiƒá is one of 39 female architects out of 276 architects represented. Along with a few other women, Nestorova-Tomiƒá played a significant role in the production of Macedonian architectural modernity.

With her mother and sisters, she formed the first biracial women's abolitionist group, the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society. She hosted anti-slavery events at her home and with her husband Robert Purvis ran an Underground Railroad station. Robert and Harriet also founded the Gilbert Lyceum. She fought against segregation and for the right for blacks to vote after the Civil War. Personal life =Early life= Harriet Davy Forten, born in Philadelphia in 1810, was one of eight children of James Forten and Charlotte Vandine Forten, who lived at 92 Lombard Street. James Forten was a wealthy inventor, businessman and abolitionist who was born free. Forten, born in 1766, was a powder boy and was taken prisoner from the Royal Lewis during the Revolutionary War. Her father was given a start in business by Robert Bridges, a white sailmaker. Harriet was named for one of Bridge's daughters. The Fortens, the most well-known black family in the city, were noted for their gentility and hospitality. William Lloyd Garrison wrote of the family \\"who have few superiors in refinement, in moral worth, in all that makes the human character worthy of admiration and praise.\\" Her father is one of the 100 Greatest African Americans, as determined by Professor Molefi Kete Asante in 2002. James and Charlotte helped found and fund six abolitionist organizations. Many abolitionists who visited Philadelphia stayed in the Forten house. The first country's biracial abolitionist organization, the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society, was founded by Charlotte, her daughters, and Lucretia Mott. The Forten women were active members and officers. Her father established a private school with Grace Douglass. Harriet and her siblings attended the school and was also taught foreign languages and music by private tutors. Her younger sisters were Sara and Margaretta, born in 1814 and 1815. There was also a sister named Mary Isabella. Her brothers were James, William Deas, Robert Bridges, and Thomas. The girls were raised to be refined women. Abolitionist and poet John Greenleaf Whittier wrote a verse for Harriet, expressing his admiration of her. She was also said to have the ladylike demeanor and manners of a Southern belle. =Interests= Harriet read a wide range of literature, including novels, religious works, literary criticism, antislavery literature, and William Shakespeare. She engaged in debate and enjoyed reading aloud, with a clear speaking voice. She sought people who had similar interests in music, art, and literature. Harriet was a member of the Black Female Literary Association, Edgeworth Literary Association, and Female Minervian Association. =Marriage and children= Robert Purvis (1810-1898), circa 1840-1849 She was married in her family's home on September 13, 1831 to a light-skinned African- American, Robert Purvis from South Carolina. Like her father, Purvis was a wealthy man. They were married by an Episcopal bishop in an \\"elegant ceremony\\". Some people gossiped about the variation in their skin tone. Purvis, an abolitionist and anti-slavery lecturer, was very open about his family history. Harriet and Robert worked together on their shared interests, activism, and reform efforts. :The Purvises' egalitarian marriage and activist partnership presented a unique phenomenon. Few such relationships existed during the Victorian era. Their marriage demonstrated one man's commitment to the concepts of equality and freedom of expression. Further, it revealed one woman's ability to transcend contemporary mores to share in both the private and public spheres of her husband's life and work. :‚ÄîJoe Trotter and Eric Ledell Smith They employed servants, including an English governess, which made it possible for Harriet to actively work on the causes important to her. Harriet's elegant English-style house and grounds, called Saint's Rest by abolitionist Sallie Holley, had a calming and restful effect on its visitors. It was where: \\"the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.\\" She was often hostess to visiting fellow activists and abolitionists, including William Lloyd Garrison, George Benson, and George Thompson. They had deep and long-term friendships with notable black and white reformers, under the belief that we are all \\"but one race\\". Others in the city rallied against blacks and people who aided refugee slaves, which erupted in race riots and violence in the 1830s. In 1834, 44 churches and buildings owned by blacks were set on fire. Harriet's sister Sarah, who married Robert's brother Joseph Purvis, wrote articles and poems for the Liberator under pseudonyms. Frank Johnson, a black band leader, wrote music for her poem The Grave of the Slave, which was often played at anti-slavery events. They lived near Robert and Harriet's family in Byberry. Harriet's brother Robert was left a widower about 1840 and his daughter, Charlotte, lived with the Purvis's and received her education from a private tutor. Due to segregation in Philadelphia, Robert did not think that she would get a good education in the city. Charlotte \\"drew personal comfort and intellectual delight\\" from her aunt. Charlotte then lived in Salem, Massachusetts with another prominent black family in 1853. Harriet's eight children were one to eighteen years of age in 1850. Charles Burleigh Purvis was a physician, medical school educator, and the first African American to run a civilian hospital. He attended Oberlin College and Wooster Medical College (Western Reserve). During the Civil War, he served as both a physician and nurse for the Union Army. Activist =Abolitionist and rights activist= Early in their marriage, Harriet had the couple's first child and Robert lectured against slavery across the country. Harriet was a member of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society and, while pregnant, attended the Women's Anti-Slavery Convention in New York in 1837 with two of her sisters. In 1838, the convention was held in Philadelphia at the new Pennsylvania Hall, which was built by the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society. Robert Purvis helped his wife out of the carriage and angry people who looked on thought that they were an interracial couple promoting \\"amalgamation\\" of the races. The hall was destroyed when it was set on fire by a group of people who were pro-slavery. The convention then convened at teacher and abolitionist Sarah Pugh's school. Black and white women participated as equals in the organization, which rare at the time. It also generated reactions among people who feared mixture of the races, or miscegenation, and were generally concerned about women's intervention in public affairs. Not put off by the riot the previous year, Harriet attended the convention the following two years. She was a delegate at the 1838 and 1839 conventions. Unable to rent a hall in Philadelphia in 1839, the convention met at a riding stables. Harriet co-chaired Philadelphia Women's Anti-Slavery Society fairs, which between 1840 and 1861 raised $32,000 (). In 1841, the group rallied against the exclusion of black Sunday schools at the annual Sunday School exhibition in Independence Square. The following year, it was a biracial event. After the Thirteenth Amendment was passed, Purvis continued her efforts to improve the rights of African Americans. The Female Antislavery Society continued to meet and in September 1866 to discuss the status of the South. Robert and Harriet became involved with the Pennsylvania State Equal Rights League and American Equal Rights Association, and served on the executive committee. She spoke for the right to vote for women and blacks and against segregation. Harriet, Robert, and Octavius Catto worked to desegregate streetcars in Philadelphia. This was done in conjunction with the Pennsylvania State Equal Rights League. In 1867, a state law was passed that provided equal access to the public vehicles for all races. =Free produce movement= Harriet became involved in the Free Produce Society. Its members purchased local produce and boycotted produce grown and picked by slaves. She was often a delegate to the Free Produce Conventions and was a member of the Colored Free Produce Association. Harriet only bought produce and products that was not made or grown by slaves. It was an activity that she continued even after some, like Garrison, question its effectiveness. Purvis, Lucretia Mott, and Sarah Pugh stayed true to their stance on free produce as a matter of principle. As author Carol Faulkner states, they \\"believed that hypocrisy threatened the success of their crusade.\\" =Underground Railroad= Map of Underground Railroad routes Harriet and Robert, called the father of the Underground Railroad for his founding of Philadelphia's Vigilance Committee, began a station in their home at 9th and Lombard Street in Philadelphia. The situation became dangerous in central Philadelphia and the family moved to a farm in rural Byberry, Philadelphia in 1843 or 1844. They assisted about 9,000 runaway slaves along their journey to Canada. Slaves were hidden from authorities in their Byberry house through a trap door that installed in the floor by Robert. Harriet hosted meetings of abolitionists in her house and was a leader of the Female Vigilant Society, which provided monies for transportation and clothing to the travelers. =Education= She saw the need for anti-slavery legislation and means to affect greater equality for African Americans in greater clarity as a mother. Private schools for African Americans were not as good as the public schools for whites. And her children would be subject to racial prejudice, even though the family lived a financially comfortable life. The Byberry Friends Meeting, a Quaker meeting house, was located across the street from the Purvis house. The Purvis children attended the Byberry Friend School. Also nearby was the Friends' Library Company and Philosophical Society and Purvis Hall, which was built by Robert Purvis in 1846 and was a meeting location for anti-slavery meetings and other community activities. Robert Purvis refused to pay the local school tax in 1853, since his children would not be afforded an education in the schools. Their children were educated by private tutors and at Quaker schools. Harriet and her husband founded the Gilbert Lyceum. =Suffragist= Harriet was a member of the National Woman Suffrage Association and a friend of Susan B. Anthony and Lucretia Mott, who also worked for the right to vote for blacks and women, against slavery, and for safe passage of refugee slaves. Harriet and her sister Margaretta Forten were key organizers of the Fifth National Women's Rights Convention in Philadelphia in 1854. Harriet's daughter, Hattie became the first African American vice president of the organization. Harriet's sisters and Charlotte were also first generation suffragists. Other black women who worked for women's right to vote included Sojourner Truth, Amelia Shadd, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, Nancy Prince, and Francis Ellen Watkins Harper. Later years In 1873, Robert and Harriet moved to a Mount Vernon neighborhood with Georgianna and Harriet, who were still at home. They kept their Byberry home, Harmony Hall, and rented it to the Pierce family. The family was beset by a series of illnesses. Three of their sons died, one from meningitis and the others from tuberculosis, which was the cause of Harriet's death on June 11, 1875. She died in Washington, D.C., where Robert worked as commissioner of Freedman‚Äôs Saving Bank, and was buried in Germantown at the Quaker Fair Hill Burial Ground at 9th and Cambria. Two years after her death, a daughter died. Robert moved to a house in Mount Vernon, Philadelphia. He married the Quaker poet Tacie Townsend, a white woman from Byberry, about 1878.

She was the sister of Sarojini Naidu. In 1920, she married A. C. N. Nambiar in Madras, but they separated due to Nambiar's affair with his secretary, Eva Geissler. After they separated, they both resided in London for some time. Suhasini studied in Oxford, then moved to Berlin. She was invited by Jayasurya, son of Sarojini Naidu, who was studying medicine there. Both of them became employed there, Jayasurya editing periodicals and Suhasini teaching English. Influenced by her brother Virendranath Chattopadhyay, better known as Chatto, she became a communist. Her brother then aided in her admission to the Eastern University in Moscow, with the help of M.

They are composed of three distinct tribes, the Nunukul, the Goenpul and the Ngugi, and they live primarily on Moreton and North Stradbroke Islands, that form the eastern side of the bay. Many of them were pushed out of their lands when the English colonial government established a penal colony near there in 1824. Each group has its own language. A number of local food sources are utilised by the tribes. Name The term Quandamooka refers geographically to the southern Moreton Bay, the waters, islands and adjacent coastal areas of the mainland. The Nunukul and Goenpul tribes lived on Stradbroke Island, while the Ngugi tribe lived on Moreton Island. The Nunukul, Goenpul and Ngugi tribes together constitute the Quandamooka people. History The archaeological remains of the Moreton Bay islands were studied intensively by V.V. Ponosov in the mid 1960s, and indigenous occupation of the islands seems to go back at least some 18,000 years BP. The Quandamooka people first encountered Europeans in 1799, when the English navigator and cartographer Matthew Flinders passed several weeks exploring Moreton Bay. The Moreton Bay people occasionally took in and cared for English ticket-of-leave castaways, most notably Thomas Pamphlet, Richard Parsons and John Finnegan, whom the explorer John Oxley found when he sailed into the bay in 1823. The first settlement, a penal colony, was established the following year by Oxley at Redcliffe with 50 settlers, 20-30 of whom were convicts. Contacts were scarce for over a decade, as no free settlers were allowed to enter within a 50 mile radius of the penal colony. As free settlers began to move in, the indigenous peoples were pushed out of the more fertile lands into the coastal fringe, with many of them moving to the less occupied small islands. The three Quandamooka peoples each faced dispossession and the loss of their hunting and fishing grounds. The presence of settlers introduced a number of diseases that ravaged the islands and coastal areas. Forced displacements and the removal of children also had an impact. The indigenous people living on Stradbroke island were able to sustain their lifestyle for the longest period; however, in 1897 the Aboriginal Protection and Restriction of the sale of Opium Act moved all indigenous people to reservations, with the exception of those who were imprisoned or were employed as servants. Culture =Nomadism= The lifestyle of the Quandamooka people was semi-nomadic, moving between semi- permanent campsites. They built shelters of various kinds, ranging from simple lean-tos for an overnight stay to more robust huts used at well-frequented campsites. Their traditions were recorded in the form of art, songs, and dances. =Language= The three tribes that comprise the Quandamooka people spoke dialects of a Durubalic language. The language that the Goenpul tribe of central and southern Stradbroke Island speaks is Jandai, and the Nunukul dialect of northern Stradbroke island was called Moondjan, the term for its distinctive word for 'no'. =Food= The Quandamooka people used several local food sources, including many from the ocean. The collection of these resources was often segregated by gender. Canoes were used to fish in Moreton Bay for Mullet, and to hunt Dugongs and Sea Turtles. They were also used to travel to the mainland to hunt. Hunting and fishing were male specialisations. Dugongs were highly prized catch, because of their multiple uses. The meat was roasted and eaten, while medicinal oil was also obtained from the animals. The men used several different techniques to catch fish. These included netting them from canoes using nets made of vines or bark, spearing them, and trapping them. The collection of other sources of food was done by women. These included shellfish, fern roots, Pandanus trees, insect larvae, berries, lily bulbs, honey, and small game. The fern roots were roasted and pounded into flour, while the fleshy part of Pandanus trees were used to make a drink. The game animals consumed by the Quandamooka included lizards, snakes, waterbirds, and marsupials. =Art and tools= The Quandamooka people made several tools and weapons from materials found locally. These included boomerangs and shields, as well as dilly bags made from woven reeds. These tools were frequently decorated with patterns, which were either burned or painted.

Location  The building stands on the western side of Gda≈Ñska Street, between ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñska Street and Chocimska street. It stands close to remarkable tenements in the same street: * Alfred Schleusener Tenement at N¬∞62; * J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki tenement at N¬∞63; * Eduard Schulz Tenement at N¬∞66-68; * Rudolf Kern Tenement at N¬∞70; * Tenement at Gdanska street 71; * Tenement at Gdanska street 75; * Ernst Bartsch tenement at N¬∞79; * Paul Storz Tenement at N¬∞81; * Otto Riedl Tenement at N¬∞ 85. History The house was completed built in 1898 by the architect Fritz Weidner, a German builder who came to Bydgoszcz at the end of the 19th century, and had a frantic building activity in the city between 1896 and 1914. The architect lived in the tenement he built at Gda≈Ñska 34 in 1912. In the same area, Fritz Weidner built houses at the following addresses: * Mix Ernst tenement and movie theatre at Gda≈Ñska Street 10 in 1905; * Thomas Frankowski Tenement at Gda≈Ñska Street 28 in 1897; * George Sikorski Tenement at Gda≈Ñska Street 31, in 1906; * Max Rosental Tenement at Gda≈Ñska Street 42 in 1905; * Ernst Bartsch tenement at Gda≈Ñska Street 79, in 1898; * House at Freedom Square 3, in 1903. The tenement at then Danzigerstra√üe 52, was first owned by a master stonecutter, Carl Bradtke who lived until 1898 in Dworcowa street () before moving to his new house in 1899. He still kept his shop of\\"Marble commodities at Bahnofstrasse 52 until the start of World War I. Carl Bradtke also commissioned another local architect, Joseph ≈öwiƒôcicki, for the construction of a nearby tenement at N¬∞93. Architecture The house presents forms of prussian Historicism, at a transition time from the Eclecticism to Secession movement. The facade has gables with different forms, bay windows, loggias and various shaped windows. The main frontage is flanked with triangular topped gables. The middle section play on symmetry, through the network of arcades and open loggias, while the upper part is purposefully designed asymmetrically. This design is a choice undertaken by Fritz Weidner: to part from stuccoes for decorative arrangement as architectural elements. Interiors have noteworthy elements, especially the ceiling in hallway and entrance adorned with flower stuccoes. The building shows similarity with a neighbouring one, at N¬∞79, also designed by Fritz Weidner.

Sharpe was born in Wigan. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, and then studied business at Oxford Brookes University. Sharpe's grandfather Dave Whelan took control of Wigan Athletic in February 1995, when the club was in the Football League Third Division, then the fourth tier of English football. The club finished fourth from bottom in 1993-94, under threat of relegation to the non-league Football Conference. Under Whelan, the club was promoted several times, reaching the Premier League in 2005. Wigan won the FA Cup on 11 May 2013, but was also relegated to the Championship at the end of the 2012-2013 season.. The Whelan family continues to own all of the shares in the company that controls Wigan Athletic. Whelan had always ear marked Sharpe to run the club and he became a director at Wigan Athletic in December 2014, while the club was in the Championship. Sharpe was appointed as chairman after his grandfather's resignation in March 2015. At the age of 23, he became one of the world's youngest football bosses. Sharpe's appointment came with shock and scepticism from both fans and the media as the youngest chairman in English football. Sharpe‚Äôs first major decision was to sack Malky Mackay on Easter Monday after a 2-0 home defeat to Derby County. With 5 games remaining till the end of the season Sharpe appointed former club captain Gary Caldwell, however Wigan Athletic fell short and were relegated to League One. Current Wigan Athletic Chairman and his Grandfather David Whelan, previous Wigan Athletic chairman The 2015/2016 season, Sharpe and Caldwell‚Äôs first full season, saw the club winning League One and being promoted to the Championship. Ahead of the new championship season further recruitment was made for key players such as Jordi Gomez, Nick Powell and Dan Burn. In the championship season 2016/ 2017 and after a run of 14 games with only 2 victories Sharpe made the bold decision to sack Gary Caldwell. Sharpe appointed Warren Joyce from Manchester United who came highly recommended from well-known names such as Sir Alex Ferguson, Joyce had previously turned down manager roles at Burnley and Blackburn. However, results didn't bring the change that the appointment of a new manager had expected. In March 2017, Joyce was sacked. The club was now in a relegation battle and Graham Barrow took over as caretaker manager. After relegation was confirmed Sharpe made the decision to approach Portsmouth for their manager Paul Cook. Cook was appointed in June 2017. Wigan managed to keep star players and under Cook have dominated League One so far this season.

She studied at The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, the Department of Experimental Art at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, China, and at Malm√∏ Art Academy. Ramdas¬¥ work seems to always take its point of departure in lens-based technology unfolding her ideas through various mediums such as; sound, text, performance, drawing, film and photography. She employs advanced meditation techniques to access the multi- dimensional archive of her own unconscious mind and explores the complexity that lies between the idea and the sensed; negotiating the values of the detectable and the undetectable. In her series Parent Bodies she reads her own body as an agent of the light sensitive material and translates this data into hand drawn blueprints that serve for future three dimensional and time-based works. Through enigmatic objects and images, her visual thought experiments and cosmic messages remind us to see, feel, trust and listen beyond the vibrational frequencies of western principles but towards the beat of the cosmos, planet earth and our soul. She has done international residencies with: La Wayaka Current in Armila, Panama (2018‚Äì19) SALT Beyoglu in Istanbul, Turkey (2013), Can Lis in Porto Petro, Spain (2013), and Bucharest AIR in Romania (2012). In 2016 she collaborated with the Danish artist Christian Danielewitz on the project Against the Grain which addresses a very important topic; the relationship between our use of technology and the global strain on the environment which follows. The two Danish artists travelled to the industrial town of Baotou - the epicenter of the Chinese mining industry, in Inner Mongolia. Here they created the works on location, using radioactive material from the gigantic tailings dam Weikuang, situated on the outskirts of the city. Weikuang Dam is a nightmare landscape, which has formed as a result of the ruthless hunt for rare earth elements, the essential material basis of our high-tech societies. The project has been presented at Galleri Image, in Aarhus, Denmark (2016) Galleri [format] in Malm√∏, Sweden (2017) at Savvy Contemporary in Berlin, Germany (2019).

She had two general areas of interest in her work, first incorporating the use of spore surface patterns into the understanding of fern diversity and systematics, and second the fern family Pteridaceae.  Biography  Alice Faber Tryon was born Alice Elizabeth Faber in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on August 2, 1920 to Arthur and Laura Bindrich Faber. Alice Tryon completed her Bachelor's degree in 1941 at Milwaukee State Teacher‚Äôs College (now the University of Wisconsin). She completed her master‚Äôs thesis on the taxonomic utility of spore characters in the spikemoss genus Selaginella at the University of Wisconsin in 1945. Her Doctoral degree she received at Washington University in 1952, where her PhD dissertation was on the diversity and taxonomy of the New World species of Pellaea, a genus of xerically adapted ferns in the Pteridaceae. She first began working with Rolla Milton Tryon, Jr. in 1945 as a student at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In 1946, she became a member of the American Fern Society and became an honorary member in 1978. The Tryons moved to Harvard in 1958, where they spent the majority of their professional careers. At Harvard, they organized and offered an annual New England Fern Conference, which brought students and professors together in an informal and productive setting. Becoming the first woman member of the New England Botanical Club in 1968, Tryon was elected President in 1978. After retiring from Harvard, the Tryons founded the Institute for Systematic Botany and endowed the Tryon Lecture Series. Throughout her career she worked closely with her husband, traveling internationally and frequently publishing together‚Äîincluding their systematic survey of the ferns, with emphasis on tropical America. Her work on spore surface patterns was enhanced by her incorporation of scanning electron microscope images. With Bernard Lugardon, an authority on the interior structure of fern spores using transmission electron microscope images, she published a complete survey of fern spore diversity in 1991. Tryon also made significant contributions to the study of fern reproductive biology with her studies of apomixis in Pellaea. In 2002, her collection was donated to the Alice and Rolla Tryon Pteridophyte Library at the University of Vermont. In 2014, Tryonia was described as a new taenitidoid fern genus in the Pteridaceae segregated from Jamesonia and Eriosorus. The name honored Tryon for her \\"extraordinary\\" work in fern systematics, which included publishing revisions of both previous genera. Tyron died March 29, 2009 in Pensacola, Florida.

The title comes from Dorothy Parker's witticism that the Bloomsbury Group, whose lives it portrays, had \\"lived in squares, painted in circles and loved in triangles\\". Plot The three-part serial centres on the close and often fraught relationship between sisters, Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf, and Vanessa‚Äôs sexually complicated alliance with gay artist Duncan Grant as they, and their group of like-minded friends, navigate their way through love, sex and artistic life through the first half of the 20th century. Production The series was commissioned by Ben Stephenson and Lucy Richer, and produced by Ecosse Films in association with Tiger Aspect Productions. The executive producers are Lucy Bedford, Amanda Coe, Douglas Rae and Lucy Richer. Filming began in August 2014 in London and Charleston Farmhouse. Cast The main roles were played by: *Eve Best as Older Vanessa Bell *Ed Birch as Lytton Strachey *Lucy Boynton as Angelica Garnett *Jack Davenport as David Garnett *Jerome Finch as Saxon Sydney-Turner *Phoebe Fox as Young Vanessa Bell *Andrew Havill as Older Clive Bell *Guy Henry as Older Leonard Woolf *Sam Hoare as Young Clive Bell *Finn Jones as Julian Bell *Edmund Kingsley as John Maynard Keynes *Lydia Leonard as Virginia Woolf *James Northcote as Adrian Stephen *James Norton as Young Duncan Grant *Rupert Penry-Jones as Older Duncan Grant *Al Weaver as Young Leonard Woolf Critical reception Writing in UK newspaper The Guardian, Lucy Mangan found that, \\"The drama took a certain effort of will to get into. You just have to accept that you are in a world where people convened salons, and probably did say things like 'Childe Harold is a load of posturing nonsense! It can‚Äôt hold a candle to Don Juan, even if the alexandrines are forced to breaking point!'\\". However, having made this effort Mangan, added: \\"[‚Ä¶] it‚Äôs very, very good. From Phoebe Fox and Lydia Leonard as the loving/warring sisters Vanessa, soon-to-be-Bell, and Virginia, slightly-later-to-be-Woolf, around whose increasingly strained relationship the story essentially revolves, to the doctor in a single scene realising his patient (the painter Duncan Grant) is 'an invert', the performances are uniformly wonderful (though Ed Birch as Lytton Strachey has so far the best part and the best time). And the script ‚Äì once you take that linguistic leap of faith ‚Äì is glorious. 'That‚Äôs what they do,' muses Virginia as she and Vanessa ponder the proclivities of the men in their house and lives. 'Exclude us. From clubs. Schools. Orifices.' Though on the last, Vanessa comes to disagree. She marries the uninverted Clive Bell and sends her sister a letter. 'Copulation a tremendous success!' Attagirl\\". In The Independent, Ellen E Jones was less impressed, writing: \\"The romantic entanglements of this set are so complicated that there is an undeniable achievement in laying them out clearly, as writer Amanda Coe has done here. Alas, the work's the thing and while this opening episode contained all the gossip, it conveyed none of the depth of thought or artistic feeling that must ultimately justify our interest (if any) in these people\\". She concluded by citing both BBC Radio 4‚Äôs parody of the Bloomsbury Group, Gloomsbury, and the \\"excellent\\" BBC Four documentary How to Be Bohemian, as having \\"advanced an alternative view of the set as, essentially, self-indulgent ninnies, cosseted by their wealth. If you've had the pleasure of either programme it would have been especially difficult to take this new drama seriously\\".

The clause states that, in order to obtain a license to compete in the Bundesliga, a club must hold a majority of its own voting rights. The rule is designed to ensure that the club's members retain overall control, by way of owning 50% of shares, +1 share, protecting clubs from the influence of external investors. Background Prior to 1998, football clubs in Germany were owned exclusively by members' associations. This meant that clubs were run as not-for-profit organisations, and private ownership was not allowed under any circumstances. This changed following a ruling by the German Football Association (DFB) in October 1998, which allowed clubs to convert their football teams into public or private limited companies. However, the \\"50+1 rule\\" requires the parent club to own at least 50% plus one additional share of the football company, ensuring that the club's members still hold a majority of voting rights. =Exceptions= In cases where a person or company has substantially funded a club for a continuous period of 20 years, it is possible for that person or company to own a controlling stake in the club. This exception most notably applies to Bayer 04 Leverkusen (owned by pharmaceuticals company Bayer), and VfL Wolfsburg (owned by automobile manufacturer Volkswagen), and has more recently allowed SAP co-founder Dietmar Hopp to gain control of his former youth club of 1899 Hoffenheim. Criticism The rule has been criticised on a number of occasions. One of the rule's most vocal opponents is Hannover 96 president Martin Kind, who argued that the rule could be in breach of EU competition law. In 2009, Hannover put forward a motion to change the 50+1 rule, but this was overwhelmingly rejected, with 32 out of 36 clubs voting against the proposal. The effectiveness of the rule has also been brought into question following the rise of RB Leipzig. Although it is theoretically possible to become a voting member in the association, RB Leipzig reserves the right to reject any membership application without citing a reason. As a result, RB Leipzig has only a handful of members, most of whom are Red Bull GmbH agents. Critics have also noted that the annual membership fee is relatively expensive compared to other clubs.

It is registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. Location The building is somehow setback on the eastern side of Gdanska Street (N¬∞84), at the intersection with Zamoyskiego street. History The villa was built in 1898-1899 by architect Karl Bergner, following an order from Carl Grosse. Mr Grosse ran in Bydgoszcz a cork factory (), with the company seat here (Danzigerstrasse 127). A subsequent owner - wood wholesaler Otto Schmidt - in the years 1918-1920 enriched the villa: he had built the decor that is still preserved today. The building has undergone many renovations with succeeding owners and users. For many years in the 1920s, rumor went that the villa belonged to actress Apolonia Chalupiec, aka Pola Negri, from which it had been purchased by industrialist Jan K≈Çossowski, called \\"cardboard king\\", who lived there with his family in the 1930s. In reality, Jan K≈Çossowski bought the villa from the Bank Ludowy () in Bydgoszcz and Pola Negri's house was located at Zamoyskiego street 8. Between 1962 and 1992, the building was the headquarters of the Civic Militia (MO), with a factory shop and a cafeteria. Architecture The tenement is decorated in a style referring to German Historicism. The villa is separated from the street by a garden. Its facade has an asymmetric block, adorned with decorative bays, avant-corps, loggias and post-and-plank structures. The interior is designed in art deco style, by Johanna H. Fricke. In addition to the stuccoes, worth noticing are stained glass, wooden reliefs (animal and plant motifs) and handrail stairwell. In the ballroom overlooking the garden is placed a fountain decorated with a sculpture of a woman washing her hair. The building has been put on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List N¬∞601312 Reg.A/1079/1-2, on December 13, 1994. Gallery File:Ogr√≥d, 1898-1899 Bydgoszcz, ul.

Biography Kaisen was born in Jeju Island, South Korea and adopted to Denmark in 1980. She received her MA in Media Art and Art Theory from The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and an MFA in Interdisciplinary Studio Art from The University of California Los Angeles. She also participated in The Whitney Independent Study Program. Working with film, video installation, photography, performance, and text, Kaisen's artistic practice is informed by extensive interdisciplinary research and engagement with diverse communities. Recurring themes involve memory, migration, and translation at the intersection of personal and collective histories. Through non-linear layered montages of image, sound, voice, and archive, she creates distinct modes of storytelling that gesture towards sites of emergence and embodied memories that linger at the margins of the seen and the said. Her narrative experimental film The Woman, The Orphan, and The Tiger (2010) made in collaboration with Guston Sondin-Kung explores the gendered effects of war and militarism by tracing a genealogy between three generations of women. In 2011 Jane Jin Kaisen began the multi-channel video installation Reiterations of Dissent for which she was awarded the Montana ENTERPRIZE. The piece has been exhibited widely and in multiple formats, among others at Asia Culture Center (KR), Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art (KR), Aarhus Kunstbygning (DK), Kunsthallen Brandts (DK), Sonoma County Museum (USA), and The Jeju April 3 Peace Park (KR). Jane Jin Kaisen is the co-founder of the artist unit itinerant with Guston Sondin Kung and together they have organized and curated a series of art exhibitions and events. She is also co-founder of the artist groups UFOlab (Unidentified Foreign Object Laboratory) with Anna Jin Hwa Borstam, Charlotte Kim Boed, Jette Hye Jin Mortensen and Trine Meesook Gleerup) as well as the artist group Orientity along with Natsue Haji OH, kimura byol-nathalie lemoine, Adel KsK, Raymond Hahn, Naomi K.

Jane Jin Kaisen has also curated exhibitions and events. She was a curator of the 10th Open International Performance Art Festival in 2009 in Beijing, China, which included performance artists from many different countries. Awards In 2008, she received the AHL Foundation Visual Arts award at Gana Art NY. In 2011, she received the award Montana Enterprize at Kunsthallen Brandts.

They have released three studio albums and one EP to date, melding black metal and post-rock music. They initially gained notoriety for marketing themselves as being from China. History Originally the band claimed to have been from Chongqing, China. Their 2014 debut studio album Funeral was released on Chinese record label Pest Productions. They then signed to German label Northern Silence Productions for the release of their second album Moonlover in 2015. Upon gaining increased media attention, including critical acclaim from Pitchfork and Stereogum, the band was revealed to be from Minot, North Dakota and fronted by Dennis Mikula. When asked why the band did not correct the false reports on their origin, Mikula stated: \\"We refused to correct people because we do not wish to put actual faces onto our music. It is our wish as a band to connect to all human beings.\\" In 2017, band followed up Moonlover with Starmourner. Musical style Ghost Bath combine elements of black metal, including tremolo picking guitar play and shrieked vocals, with uplifting melodies and atmospheric qualities inspired by post- rock. Their style has thus been associated with blackgaze and post-metal and frequently compared to that of fellow American band Deafheaven, particularly on their breakthrough 2013 album Sunbather.

This first spaceflight was an uncrewed mission that launched on 2 March 2019 at 07:49:03 UTC or 02:49:03 EST, and arrived at the International Space Station on 3 March 2019, a little over 24 hours after the launch. The mission ended following a successful splashdown on 8 March 2019 at 13:45:08 UTC or 08:45:08 EST. During a separate test, on 20 April 2019, the capsule used on Crew Demo-1 was unexpectedly destroyed when firing the SuperDraco engines at Landing Zone 1. Mission The spacecraft tested the approach and automated docking procedures with the International Space Station (ISS), consequent undocking from the ISS, full re-entry, splashdown and recovery steps to provide data requisite to subsequently qualify for flights transporting humans to the ISS. Life support systems were being monitored all throughout the test flight. The same capsule was planned for re-use in an in-flight abort test, but it was destroyed in an accident during a static fire test of its SuperDraco thrusters. The mission was launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket contracted by NASA's Commercial Crew Program. Initial plans had hoped to see CCDev2 flights as early as 2015. DM-1 was eventually slated for no earlier than December 2016, and then delayed several times throughout 2017. The first exact date was published by NASA in November 2018 to be 17 January 2019, but this got pushed into February 2019. The static fire took place on 24 January 2019 and the launch date was set to 23 February 2019. By the end of January 2019, the launch was delayed to no earlier than 2 March 2019 according to a FCC filing by SpaceX for Dragon 2 capsule telemetry, tracking, and command. DM-1 passed its Flight Readiness Review and Launch Readiness Review on 22 February 2019 and 27 February 2019 respectively. The Falcon 9 with DM-1 rolled out to the LC-39A on 28 February 2019 at around 15:00 UTC and went vertical a few hours later. The spacecraft was launched on 2 March 2019 at 07:49:03 UTC and successfully docked to the ISS on 3 March 2019 at 10:51 UTC. The Dragon 2 capsule successfully undocked from the ISS on 8 March 2019 at 07:32 UTC, performed entry into the Earth's atmosphere and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean about off Florida's east coast later that day at 13:45:08 UTC. The capsule was recovered using SpaceX's recovery ship GO Searcher and was returned to the mainland where it was examined and the data collected by the on board sensors was analyzed.Mission SpX-DM1 accomplished: the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft has come back to Earth. Massimo Luciani, Tachyon Beam. March 8, 2019. Payload Instead of carrying astronauts to the ISS, this flight had an Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) wearing SpaceX's custom flight suit. The ATD is named Ripley, as a homage to Sigourney Weaver's character in the Alien movies franchise. The capsule was weighted similarly to missions with astronauts onboard and carried approximately of supplies and equipment including a \\"super high tech zero-g indicator\\" (a plush toy). The \\"zero-g indicator\\" was left on board the ISS after undocking, while Ripley returned safely to Earth on 8 March 2019.

The spacecraft, named Endeavour, launched on 30 May 2020 at 19:22:45 UTC (3:22:45 PM EST) on top of Falcon 9 Booster B1058.1, and carried NASA astronauts Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken to the International Space Station in the first crewed orbital spaceflight launched from the United States since the final Space Shuttle mission, STS-135, in 2011, and the first ever operated by a commercial provider. Demo-2 was also the first two-person orbital spaceflight launched from the United States since STS-4 in 1982. Demo-2 was intended to complete the validation of crewed spaceflight operations using SpaceX hardware and to receive human-rating certification for the spacecraft, including astronaut testing of Crew Dragon capabilities on orbit. During their time aboard, Behnken conducted four spacewalks with fellow American astronaut Chris Cassidy to replace batteries brought up by a Japanese cargo vehicle. Docking and undocking operations were autonomously controlled by the Crew Dragon, but monitored by the flight crew in case manual intervention became necessary. The spacecraft soft docked with the International Space Station at 14:16 UTC on 31 May 2020. Following soft capture, 12 hooks were closed to complete a hard capture 11 minutes later. Hurley and Behnken worked alongside the crew of Expedition 63 for 62 days. Endeavour autonomously undocked from the station at 23:35 UTC on 1 August 2020 and returned the astronauts to Earth on 2 August 2020 in the first water landing by astronauts since 1975. Endeavour will be refurbished and reused for the SpaceX Crew-2 mission, expected to launch in March of 2021. Crew Dragon's next mission, SpaceX Crew-1 ‚Äî SpaceX's first operational astronaut flight ‚Äî is slated to fly with four Expedition 64 astronauts in late October 2020.  Background  After the Space Shuttle program was brought to an end in 2011, NASA no longer had a spacecraft system capable of sending humans to space. As a result, it was forced to fly its astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard the Russian Soyuz space vehicle, at a cost of up to US$80 million per astronaut. As an alternative, NASA contracted with private companies such as SpaceX for the Commercial Crew Program, which is expected to cost 50% less than Soyuz once in regular operation. Up to the launch, NASA has awarded a total of US$3.1 billion for the development of the Dragon 2. The Demo-2 mission is expected to be SpaceX's last major test before NASA certifies it for regular crewed spaceflights. Prior to that, SpaceX had sent twenty cargo missions to the ISS, but never a crewed one. Other than SpaceX, Boeing is also working on crewed orbital spaceflight under the same NASA effort.  Crew  Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken were announced as the primary crew on 3 August 2018. Both astronauts are veterans of the Space Shuttle program, and the Demo-2 flight was the third trip to space for both of them. The lead flight director for this mission was Zebulon Scoville. NASA astronaut Kjell Lindgren was the sole backup crew member for the flight, backing up both Hurley and Behnken for the mission.  Insignia and livery  The mission insignia was designed by artist Andrew Nyberg from Brainerd, Minnesota, a nephew of spacecraft commander Hurley. The insignia features the logos of the Commercial Crew Program, Falcon 9, Crew Dragon, and the red chevron of NASA's \\"meatball\\" insignia. Also depicted are the American flag and a graphic representation of the ISS. The words NASA, SPACEX, FIRST CREWED FLIGHT and DM-2 are printed around the border along with the surnames of the astronauts. The insignia outline is in the shape of the Crew Dragon capsule. The Falcon 9 rocket used to launch Endeavour displayed NASA's \\"worm\\" insignia, the first time the logo had been used officially since it was retired in 1992. NASA TV and media coverage of the launch was branded as \\"Launch America\\", with its own logo. The SpaceX logo shows the top of the company's spacesuit, with the ISS and North America portrayed on the helmet shield and a white star denoting the launch site at Cape Canaveral. Behind the suit are the American flag, and around the insignia's black border SPACEX DRAGON and NASA DEMO-2 are written in white, alongside the names of the two astronauts at the bottom; with a cloverleaf between the two names.  Pre-launch processing  NASA calculated the loss-of-crew (LOC) probability for the test flight as 1-in-276, lower than the commercial crew program requirement threshold of 1-in-270. The 1-in-276 number included mitigations to reduce the risk, such as on-orbit inspections of the Crew Dragon spacecraft once it was docked to the space station to look for damage from micrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD). NASA pegged the overall risk of a loss of mission (LOM) as 1-in-60, covering scenarios where the Crew Dragon does not reach the space station as planned, but the crew safely returns to Earth. 320x320px The Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission was initially planned for launch in July 2019 as part of the Commercial Crew Development contract with a crew of two on a 14-day test mission to the ISS. The Crew Dragon capsule from the Crew Dragon Demo-1 mission was destroyed while its SuperDraco thrusters were undergoing static fire testing on 20 April 2019, ahead of its planned use for the in-flight abort test. SpaceX traced the cause of the anomaly to a component that leaked oxidizer into the high- pressure helium lines, which then solidified and damaged a valve. The valves were since switched for burst discs to prevent another anomaly. On 19 January 2020, a Crew Dragon capsule successfully completed an in-flight abort test. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said on 9 April 2020 that he was \\"fairly confident\\" that astronauts could fly to the ISS aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spaceship at the end of May or in early June 2020, pending final parachute tests, data reviews and a training schedule that could escape major impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. SpaceX CEO left On 17 April 2020, NASA and SpaceX announced the launch date as 27 May 2020. The arrival of the Crew Dragon will have raised the station's crew size from three to five. Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will have performed duties and conducted experiments as crew on board the ISS for several months. Hurley and Behnken were expected to live and work aboard the space station for two or three months, and then return to Earth for a splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean east of Cape Canaveral. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine urged space enthusiasts not to travel to the Kennedy Space Center to view the launch and asked people to instead watch the launch on television or online. Bridenstine explained that maintenance crews are working in cohesive shifts, to mitigate workers' exposure to SARS- CoV-2. On 1 May 2020, SpaceX successfully demonstrated the Mark 3 parachute system, a critical milestone for the mission approval. Crew Dragon Demo-2 will have marked the first crewed United States spaceflight mission not to include the presence of the public at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the mission was previously delayed, the Visitor Complex opened as of 28 May 2020 with limited capacity for publicly viewing the launch. Admissions sold out almost immediately. To engage the public, notably the Class of 2020, who were unable to attend their graduations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, both NASA and SpaceX invited students and graduates to submit their photos to be flown to the ISS. Behnken and Hurley arrived at Kennedy Space Center on 20 May 2020 in preparation for the launch. On 21 May 2020, the Falcon 9 rocket was rolled out to the launch pad, and a static fire test was conducted on 22 May 2020; a major milestone ahead of the launch. The mission used a Tesla Model X to transport Hurley and Behnken to LC-39A, the journey did not use Tesla Autopilot. = Launch attempts = An official launch weather forecast for Dragon Crew Demo-2 by the 45th Weather Squadron of the U.S. Space Force, for the original launch time at 20:33:33 UTC on 27 May 2020, predicted a 50% probability of favorable conditions. The launch was scrubbed at T‚àí16:53 minutes due to thunderstorms and light rain in the area. The first attempt to launch on 27 May 2020 was aborted due to bad weather caused by Tropical Storm Bertha, 16 minutes and 53 seconds prior to launch. The second launch attempt was successful and took place on 30 May 2020 at 19:22:45 UTC with a 50% probability of favorable conditions. The other launch windows were 31 May 2020 at 19:00:07 UTC, with a 60% probability of favorable conditions and 2 June 2020 at 18:13 UTC with a 70% probability of favorable conditions.  Mission  = Launch and orbit = Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump watch the Crew Dragon Demo-2 Falcon 9 rocket launch from Kennedy Space Center. Three days after the first launch attempt was scrubbed, the Crew Dragon Endeavour launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A at 19:22:45 UTC on 30 May 2020. The first stage booster (serial number B1058) landed autonomously on the floating barge Of Course I Still Love You, which was prepositioned in the Atlantic Ocean. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, with their wives, were at Kennedy Space Center in Florida to see the launch attempt on 27 May 2020, and returned for launch on 30 May 2020. The launch live stream was watched online by 3 million people on NASA feeds, and the SpaceX feed peaked at 4.1 million viewers. NASA estimated roughly 10 million people watched on various online platforms, approximately 150,000 people gathered on Florida's space coast in addition to an unknown number watching on television. Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken revealed the name of their Crew Dragon capsule 206, Endeavour, shortly after launch, reviving another old tradition from the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs where astronauts would name their spacecraft. It was the third US spacecraft named Endeavour, after the Space Shuttle Endeavour, built in 1991 to replace , which was destroyed in 1986, and the Apollo command and service module used for the Apollo 15 mission in 1971. Hurley said that they chose Endeavour as both his and Behnken's first flights to space were on the . NASA and SpaceX broadcast of the mission's launch, from ignition to capsule separationleft Each crew member brought along a toy from their family; an Apatosaurus dinosaur named \\"Tremor\\" and a Ty plush toy. As in past space missions, the plush toy was used as an indication of zero gravity for the strapped-in astronauts. Behnken and Hurley said, \\"That was a super cool thing for us to get a chance to do for both of our sons who I hope are super excited to see their toys floating around with us on board\\". The crew were awakened on the second day of the flight with Black Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan\\". NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts' families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities. = Approach, docking, and activities aboard the ISS = Nineteen hours later, Endeavour approached the ISS. Hurley demonstrated the ability to pilot the spacecraft via its touchscreen controls until it reached a distance of , after which Endeavour autonomously soft- docked to the pressurized mating adapter PMA-2 on the Harmony module of the ISS at 14:16 UTC on 31 May 2020. Following soft capture, 12 hooks were closed to complete a hard capture at 14:27 UTC. Approximately two hours after docking, the last of three hatches between Endeavour and ISS was opened and Hurley and Behnken boarded the ISS at 17:22 UTC, welcomed by and joining the ISS Expedition 63 crew, consisting of NASA astronaut Christopher \\"Chris\\" Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner. Over their time aboard the ISS, Hurley and Behnken spent over 100 hours completing science experiments, while traveling 27 million miles over their 1024 orbits of the Earth. Behnken also completed 4 spacewalks with Chris Cassidy. = Undocking and return = NASA mission managers had evaluated additional sites off Panama City, Florida, Tallahassee, Tampa, and Daytona Beach to provide more options in the event of stormy tropical weather. The United States Coast Guard advised against entering a square defined in its Notices to Mariners for the hours leading up to splashdown noting \\"hazardous space operations\\" and the FAA restricted air traffic in the area in a NOTAM. Endeavour stayed docked to the ISS for 62 days, 9 hours and 8 minutes, undocking at 23:35 UTC on 1 August 2020. At the time of undocking, Endeavour weighed approximately 12,520 kg (27,600 pounds). The capsule completed four departure burns to move away from the ISS, followed by a phasing burn lasting over six minutes to place the capsule on a trajectory to return to Earth. The crew was awakened on the final day of the flight with prerecorded voice messages from their sons. A yaw maneuver occurred at 17:51 to separate the \\"claw\\" umbilical mechanism from the trunk. The deorbit burn of 11 minutes and 22 seconds occurred shortly after 17:56 UTC. Just before reentry at 18:11 UTC, the nose cone was closed. Drogue chutes deployed at 18:44 UTC for approximately one minute drawing out main parachute deployment approximately one minute later. A maximum of 4 g was experienced by Dragon capsule and its crew during the re-entry period. Endeavour returned to Earth with 150 kg of cargo including 90 kg of science cargo, mostly kept in freezers. Sixty-three days, 23 hours, 25 minutes and 21 seconds after launch, at 18:48:06 UTC on 2 August 2020, Endeavour splashed down off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, marking the first splashdown in 45 years for NASA astronauts since the Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project, as well as the first splashdown of a crewed spacecraft in the Gulf of Mexico.https://www.wkrg.com/northwest-florida/nasa-confirms-spacex-crew- dragon-will-splashdown-in-pensacola/ SpaceX twitter update After splashdown, a crew in one fast boat approached the capsule, checking the air quality for any traces of highly toxic hypergolic propellant which could indicate a leak, while a crew in another fast boat collected the four parachutes which had disconnected from the capsule. While crews worked, many private boats entered the hazardous area defined by the Coast Guard despite earlier warnings. Some moving close to the capsule even passing between the capsule placing themselves and recovery crews themselves in danger. After radioed warnings, the boats dispersed to form a more distant ring around the capsule. The United States Coast Guard said in a statement later that evening that previous warnings were advisory in nature; the three patrol boats in the area were stationed within their jurisdiction and did not provide sufficient resources to board vessels interfering with the recovery. The statement added that they would be reviewing events with NASA and SpaceX. Later SpaceX and NASA confirmed that their next mission will have a enforceable keep-out zone patrolled by the U.S. Coast Guard. There will be more boats to assist in enforcing the keep-out zone. The GO Navigator ship, with the assistance of a fast boat crew, attached to the capsule using a retracting A-frame device over the back to place the capsule on the \\"nest\\". The \\"nest\\" was then pulled further on board the ship where a 30-minute purge of the service section took place, as there were abnormally high levels of dinitrogen tetroxide detected around the capsule. Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken were then greeted by crew aboard GO Navigator and were subsequently helped out of the capsule and onto stretchers where they were taken into the onboard medical facility, before taking a helicopter back to land. Post-flight analysis of the Dragon's heat shield revealed higher than expected erosion, at four points where the capsule bolts to the trunk of the vehicle using tension ties. SpaceX stated that the erosion was likely caused by air flow phenomena that were not expected to occur around the ties. The heat shield design was changed to include more erosion resistant martials at the ties. One of four ties was noted to have deep erosion. Though it could not be determined why this was not seen during SpaceX Demo-1, Hans Koenigsmann speculated that it may be related to different mass and trajectory flown by the spacecraft. In addition, SpaceX noted that the parachutes were deployed lower than expected, but still within the allowable range. To address the issue, the instrument used to measure barometric pressure which determines attitude was replaced. = Timeline = Note: all times in UTC * T+00:00:00 (19:22:45, 30 May 2020) ‚Äî the Crew Dragon spacecraft launches from Launch Complex 39A at Cape Canaveral, Florida. * T+00:01:01 (19:23:46) ‚Äî Max-Q * T+00:02:38 (19:25:23) ‚Äî MECO * T+00:02:40 (19:25:25) ‚Äî Stage separation of the Falcon 9. * T+00:08:50 (19:31:35) ‚Äî SECO * T+00:12:08 (19:34:53) ‚Äî Endeavour separates from the second stage. * T+17:54 (13:56, 31 May 2020) ‚Äî Crew Dragon reaches Waypoint 1 for docking with the ISS. * T+18:54 (14:16) ‚Äî Initial soft docking with the ISS. * T+19:05 (14:27) ‚Äî Hard docking with the ISS. * T+21:39 (17:01) ‚Äî Hatch opening. * T+21:59 (17:22) ‚Äî Behnken and Hurley board the ISS. * T+27 days (26 June 2020) ‚Äî First spacewalk. * T+32 days (1 July 2020) ‚Äî Second spacewalk. * T+47 days (16 July 2020) ‚Äî Third spacewalk. * T+52 days (21 July 2020) ‚Äî Fourth spacewalk. * T+63 days, 09:08 (23:35, 1 August 2020) ‚Äî Undocking from ISS. * T+63 days, 23:25:21 (18:48:06, 2 August 2020) ‚Äî Capsule return to Earth, splashdown, mission ends. * T+64 days, 00:36 (19:59, 2 August 2020) ‚Äî Crew recovery by GO Navigator.

Membership is open to anyone interested in these objectives. There have been eleven Presidents of the FSBI since its foundation including Ray Beverton FRS and Felicity Huntingford FRSE. Origins In the mid-1960s, several annual conferences on fish ecology were initiated in Liverpool in the United Kingdom, by Dr Jack W. Jones, a member of the Department of Zoology at the University of Liverpool. In March 1967 at one of these meetings informal discussion took place about the formation of a British society for fish and fisheries biology. Participants in the discussion were Jack Jones, David LeCren, a biologist at the Freshwater Biological Association Laboratory at Windermere, Peter Tombleson, an angling journalist and administrator, Lionel Mawdesley-Thomas, a fish pathologist at the Huntingdon Research Centre, and Alwynne Wheeler a taxonomist at the Natural History Museum, London. The discussions led to an inaugural meeting of the Fisheries Society of the British Isles on 21 October 1967 at the meeting rooms of the Zoological Society of London. James Chubb, also from the Department of Zoology, University of Liverpool, was appointed as the first editor of its journal, the Journal of Fish Biology. Medal awards The Society awards medals to recognize distinction in the field of fish biology and fisheries science and to raise the profile of the discipline and of the Society in the wider scientific community. Medals are awarded to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to fish biology and/or fisheries. Medals awarded include the Beverton Medal, named in honour of Ray Beverton, and the FSBI Medal awarded to younger scientists. Grants The FSBI supports research in the fields of fish biology and fisheries science through the award of a range of research grants, studentships, internships and travel scholarships. The schemes are designed to support researchers at all stages of their career, from undergraduate through to post-retirement.

Her career was relatively short, but during that time she exhibited at the Royal Academy twelve times. Early career Herford was born on 16 October 1831 to John Herford and Sarah Smith Herford. She studied under Eliza Fox (1824‚Äì1903), an artist best known for her genre and portraiture scenes which incorporated contemporary social commentary. Fox held drawing classes for female artists in the living room of her father's home in Regent's Park. Amongst others, Barbara Bodichon and Anna Mary Howitt attended these classes and others run by London-based artists. From the mid-1850s, Herford was heavily involved with the acceptance of women artists. She signed the 1859 petition to admit women to the Royal Academy. She applied under the name 'L. Hereford' and became a pupil in 1861 as the only woman at the Academy. She exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1861 to 1869 and also at the Suffolk Street Gallery and the British Institution.Laura Hereford in B√©n√©zit Hereford exhibited in 1864 a picture entitled A Quiet Corner, and followed up her success by similar domestic scenes in 1865, 1866, and 1867. She invited her sister's daughter, the painter Helen Allingham, to come live with her in London at the start of her career. Admittance to the Royal Academy Petitions for women to be accepted into the Royal Academy as students had been submitted to House of Commons since the 1840s, however, the Academy resisted the call for change. After encouragement from Charles Eastlake and Thomas Heatherley, Herford submitted several drawings to the Academy's admissions tutors signed \\"L. Herford\\". The use of initials masked her gender, leading to the assumption that she was a man. She was admitted on the merits of these drawings and an offer was made to \\"L. Herford, Esq\\" and she took up her place at the Academy in 1860. Her entry into the Academy marked a significant turning point for women artists in Britain. By 1863, there were ten women artists at the Academy and at the time of Herford's death there were about 40 women studying the full curriculum which included drawing from a live model.

It was released on 7 October 1991 on 4AD. The opening track, \\"Nothing Natural\\", was released as a single with the B-side \\"God's Gift\\". Several other songs were included on the EP, including a cover version of \\"Lady\\" by Dennis Wilson. Produced by Cocteau Twins guitarist Robin Guthrie, Black Spring was the result of several months of writing by Lush. The band originally intended to release a full-length studio album in spring 1991, but found themselves with little material after the release of their 1990 EPs. Lush recorded Black Spring at September Sound in London in September 1991, experimenting with their guitar and drum sound using sequencers and MIDI. Upon its release, Black Spring reached No. 2 in the UK Independent Singles Chart, and \\"Nothing Natural\\" peaked at No. 43 on the UK Singles Chart. The EP was followed by a national British tour, during which bassist Steve Rippon left the band and was replaced by Phil King. Background and recording Between 1989 and 1990, Lush released the mini album Scar, as well as two EPs‚ÄîMad Love and Sweetness and Light‚Äîthat were compiled and released on the compilation album Gala in November 1990. Receiving unanimous acclaim, Gala was due to be succeeded by a full-length debut album in spring 1991. However, Lush found themselves in a situation where they only \\"[had] about two and a half songs\\". Vocalist- guitarist Miki Berenyi attributed the lack of output to the sheer amount of material released between 1989 and 1990, explaining in Sounds in January 1991: \\"Having released Sweetness and Light with two extra songs on it, we're again left in a position where we haven't got any songs.\\" She further said that \\"most bands have been going a fair amount of time and've built up a set\\", whereas Lush had not and didn't feel like writing an album's worth of new material unless it was \\"a more coherent body of work\\". By summer 1991, Lush had composed up to 21 new songs, and hinted at new material, expressing an interest in experimenting with drum machines, sequencers and MIDI equipment. Guitarist Emma Anderson said the band were attempting to become more \\"technically minded\\" and create \\"some more interesting sounds\\" without sounding overproduced. Lush began recording Black Spring in September, choosing Guthrie as a producer; he had produced Mad Love for the band in 1990. The recording sessions were held at September Sound, Guthrie's own recording studio in southwest London, with Guthrie and assistant engineer Mitsuo Tate. Guthrie's contributions to Black Spring included extensive use of compressors and gates, and recording the majority of Anderson and Berenyi's guitar tracks via DI units instead of using the traditional method of using microphones to record the guitar amplifiers. Occasional microphone-recorded guitar tracks were used during the sessions; Berenyi's Mesa Boogie Mark IV combo amplifier was recorded in mono and Anderson's was recorded in stereo. The band chose not to record both guitarists' tracks in stereo as \\"it would be too much\\" considering the amount of delay used. Lyrics and music Black Spring features four songs: \\"Nothing Natural\\", a cover of Dennis Wilson's \\"Lady\\" (retitled \\"Fallin in' Love\\"), \\"God's Gift\\" and \\"Monochrome\\". Anderson was the primary songwriter of Black Springs material; Anderson solely wrote and composed \\"Nothing Natural\\" and \\"Monochrome\\", and co-wrote \\"God's Gift\\" with Berenyi. As a result of Anderson's increased role in Lush's songwriting, Black Springs songs were \\"lighter and less punky\\" than the band's previous releases, but the songs‚Äîparticularly the lyrics‚Äîstill maintained the band's \\"moody dreampop\\" trademarks. Producer Robin Guthrie (pictured in 2008) experimented with sequencing and sampling drummer Chris Aclands drum sound Described as \\"space-age guitar pop\\" featuring Anderson and Berenyi's \\"wistful, hippy harmonies\\", the songs on Black Spring are marked by unconventional and constantly changing time signatures developed by Anderson and drummer Chris Acland. Acland's drum sound on Black Spring changed significantly as a result of in-studio experimentation. Berenyi had originally experimented writing drum loops on a Roland R-5, but Acland instead worked with producer Robin Guthrie on writing and recording his drum parts. Guthrie suggested a technique in which Acland's tracks were played into a sequencer from Simmons pads, which then triggered sampled drum sounds. The technique was used on all of Acland's drum tracks‚Äîexcept for the cymbals‚Äîand he was initially critical of the process, stating \\"it doesn't seem that natural\\", but said the process was \\"quicker\\" and \\"the end result sounds like a really good drum kit\\". Black Spring features a celeste sample and Roland drum machine on \\"Fallin' in Love\\", as well as Lush's effects-laden guitar sound throughout. Anderson and Berenyi both used a vast amount of chorus effect on their guitars; Berenyi's chorus sound was from a Boss CE-2 pedal and Anderson's from a Roland GP-16 multieffects unit. Berenyi used several other Boss effects on Black Spring, including distortion (DS-1), overdrive (SD-1) and delay (DD-3). Packaging and music video Black Springs packaging and artwork was designed by Vaughan Oliver, who had designed artwork for all of Lush's previous releases. Oliver's designs featured photography by Jim Friedman. As with their previous releases, Lush included two obscure messages on the run-out matrix codes on the groove of the 12-inch record pressing of Black Spring. The messages read \\"Lush and Ride at the Enormodrome\\" on side 1 and \\"they've got this much talent\\" on side 2. A promotional music video was released for \\"Nothing Natural\\" in 1991. Reflecting on the music video, Berenyi said it was \\"an effing nightmare\\" and that the video's director had \\"some ludicrous idea of what he wanted [Lush] to look/act like in the video and it was nothing to do with how [the band was]\\". Berenyi further explained that the band went along with the director's suggestion as Lush \\"had no ideas of [their] own at all, and back in the [19]90s the solution was to offer directors a shitload of money to come up with something fabulous that MTV would play\\". According to Berenyi, Nirvana vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain became a Lush fan after seeing the music video. Release and reception Black Spring was released on 7 October 1991 on 4AD. It was issued as a 12-inch and CD, and was later made available as a digital download. Black Springs opening track, \\"Nothing Natural\\", was issued as the EP's lead single on the same day. Featuring a shortened edit of the title track, it was released as a 7\\" and cassette single, with \\"God's Gift\\" as the B-side. A maxi CD single was released in the United States, with \\"God's Gift\\", \\"Monochrome\\" and the full-length EP version of \\"Nothing Natural\\" as B-sides. \\"Monochrome\\" was originally intended as Black Springs main A-side and single‚Äîas suggested by producer Robin Guthrie‚Äîbut 4AD instead chose \\"Nothing Natural\\", believing it to be a superior track. \\"Nothing Natural\\" entered the UK Singles Chart in its first week of release, peaking at No. 43, and Black Spring reached No. 2 on the UK Independent Singles Chart. \\"Nothing Natural\\" also charted in the US, peaking at No. 22 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart. In support of both Black Spring and the \\"Nothing Natural\\" single, Lush began a two-leg national tour, during which the band exclusively debuted the songs from the EP. The tour began with two \\"warm-up\\" shows at Colne Municipal Hall in Colne on 7 October 1991 and Northampton Irish Centre in Corby on 8 October, before three main shows at various London venues from 9 to 12 October. The second leg, featuring support from Gallon Drunk, included eight further dates, starting at the University of Bradford on 21 October and concluding at Fox's in Wolverhampton on 28 October. Just before the second leg of the Black Spring tour, bassist Rippon decided to leave Lush. It was reported that he left due to \\"personal reasons\\", but that his relationship with the rest of the band was \\"perfectly amicable\\". Rippon confirmed later that the band's \\"strenuous schedule\\" for 1992, including planned tours of Australia, Japan and the US, contributed to his decision. He continued until the end of the tour, after which he was replaced by King in December 1991. \\"Nothing Natural\\" and \\"Monochrome\\" were featured on Lush's debut full-length studio album, Spooky (1992), and remastered versions of both songs were included on Ciao! Best of Lush, a compilation album released in 2001.

The first members were mainly prosperous women who believed in using non-violent means to obtain rights by presenting the justice of the cause. Issues in the first half century included the right to vote, legal equality between husband and wife, paternal child support, social support for children, equal employment opportunity, equal pay for equal work and acquisition of citizenship on marriage. The National Council of French Women is affiliated with the International Council of Women (ICW). Now the oldest of French feminist organizations, it continues to work for causes related to the rights of women. Background The dignified and respectable Eliska Vincent (1841‚Äì1914) founded the feminist group \\"Equality of Asni√®res\\" in 1888, which engaged in a moderate form of activism for women's suffrage that drew support from bourgeois women. She succeeded Hubertine Auclert (1848‚Äì1914) as the generally recognized leader of the suffrage movement in Paris when Auclert moved to Algeria in 1888. During the 1900 World Exposition in Paris there were several women's congresses and meetings. Feminists differed on subjects such as the responsibility of fathers for illegitimate children, where paternal recognition would give a child the right to bear their father's name and to inherit from him, but would also in some cases give the father the right of custody. At one of the conferences Maria Pognon, who would be one of the founders of the CNFF, argued against paternity suits and for a national maternity fund to support unwed mothers and their children. Her proposal was rejected by the majority of attendees. The 1900 meetings included the philanthropic and educational Congress of Women's Works and Institutions (Congr√®s des ≈íuvres et Institutions F√©minines) and the Congress on the Status and Rights of Women (Congr√®s de la Condition et des Droits de la Femme) which called for full gender equality. The two groups decided to combine to form the CNFF, defined as a federation of associations with the purpose of improving the condition of women in education, economics, society, philanthropy and politics. By this time Eliska Vincent had lost her enthusiasm for Equality, and resigned when it joined the National Council of French Women. Foundation Sarah Monod, first president of the CNFF The CNFF was formally launched on 18 April 1901. The initial committee was headed by Isabelle Bogelot. It included Sarah Monod (1836‚Äì1912), Avril de Sainte-Croix (1855‚Äì1939) and Julie Siegfried (1848‚Äì1922) from the Congress of Women's Works and Institutions, and Marie Bonnevial, Madame Wiggishoff and Maria Pognon from the Congress on the Status and Rights of Women. Although Maria Pognon was concerned that Sarah Monod was for many the \\"standard-bearer of Protestantism,\\" the choice of the majority was for Sarah Monod to be president due to her high moral and intellectual character. The majority of the members of the council were moderate bourgeois Republicans. There was a tiny minority of socialists headed by Louise Saumoneau and Elisabeth Renaud, balanced by the Catholic Right led by Marie Maugeret. The teacher Marie Bonnevial, a contributor to the feminist daily La Fronde, and a well-known feminist by the start of the 20th century, was deeply involved in both the CNFF and in the French league for women's rights (Ligue fran√ßaise pour le droit des femmes). At its inaugural meeting the CNFF claimed to have 35 associated organizations with 21,000 members. These did not include Catholic women's groups, who were more likely to affiliate with the Patriotic League of Frenchwomen (Ligue Patriotique des Fran√ßaises). Most Catholic women philanthropists accepted the patriarchal view of the family promulgated by their church and did not participate in the CNFF. History =Pre-World War I= Julie Siegfried, second president The CNFF peaked in the period before World War I (1914-18), an era when feminist movements flourished in Europe and elsewhere. The CNFF joined the International Council of Women (ICW), created in 1888 in the United States. On 10 May 1902 the CNFF, with 40 federated associations representing 28,000 members, passed a unanimous motion that women's suffrage was the most basic of all women's demands. From 1902 Avril de Sainte-Croix was a strong advocate of women's suffrage in the CNFF. In 1903 Sainte-Croix was secretary general of the CNFF and also of the French branch of the International Abolitionist Federation, which she ran from her home at 1 Avenue Malakoff. Pauline Kergomard was president of the CNFF section on education from 1905 to 1920. The CNFF passed a resolution against abortion in 1906, citing the maternal mission and the altruistic function of mothers. The majority of feminists in France felt that delinquent fathers of illegitimate children should be forced to provide support, but did not deserve paternal rights. In 1903 the CNFF and the French Group for Feminist Studies led a group that proposed a law in which paternity would be based on a reasonable presumption rather than absolute proof, the father would be required to pay to support the child, but the mother would retain parental power. The supporters of the feminists in the Chamber of Deputies would not accept this proposal, since they felt it did not encourage marriage and paternal responsibility. A law passed in 1912 required proof of paternity in writing, did not allow recognition of children of incest or adultery, and imposed heavy fines on women whose attempts to prove paternity were rejected. The CNFF, at first moderate in stating its position, was very active between 1909 and 1914 in advocating women's suffrage. By 1910 the CNFF had almost 75,000 members. On 11 November 1911 Sarah Monod received the Legion of Honor from the hands of Senator Camille Ferdinand Dreyfus. The French government noted a number of reforms that had been inspired or recommended by the CNFF under her leadership: Julie Siegfried (1848-1922), from a Protestant and deeply Republican bourgeois family, took over the leadership of the CNFF from Monod in 1912. Gabrielle Duch√™ne, a wealthy philanthropist who helped organize seamstresses in Paris, was president of the labor section of the CNFF from 1913 to 1915. On the eve of World War I there were 150 societies in the CNFF including the French Union of Woman Suffrage, with 80 branches, the Society for the Improvement of Women's Lot and the Fraternal Union of women. =World War I= When World War I (1914‚Äì18) began feminists were expected to suspend their demands and support their country in its struggle. During the war the CNFF would not support the pacifist movement. The official line was that French women had always been sympathetic to pacifism and sought \\"peace and international understanding, if not in the entire world, at least in Europe.\\" However, \\"until the German women protested to their own government against its violations of international law and the crimes of its army against civilians, any cooperation with them would be a betrayal of the nation; the fact that they belong to the female sex was quite irrelevant.\\" =Inter-war years= Avril de Sainte-Croix Unlike other European countries, women in France did not gain the right to vote after the war, but the CNFF gained influence and prestige. In 1919 Avril de Sainte-Croix and the CNFF engaged in a campaign to convince the Allied leaders at the Versailles Peace Conference to address women and their problems in the charter of the new League of Nations, with partial success. The CNFF also worked to convince the French senators to pass the bill for women's suffrage. Julie Siegfried's husband, Jules Siegfried, was a deputy and won passage of the right for women to vote in 1919, but the law was rejected by the Senate. Julie Siegfried was decorated with the Knight's cross of the Legion of Honor by Alexandre Millerand. Avril de Sainte-Croix organized the CNFF congress in 1919. The congress was held in Strasbourg on 8-9 October 1919. At this meeting it called for a reform to the laws so that a French woman who married a foreigner could choose to retain her nationality. A draft change to the law was proposed under which a French woman would remain French unless she chose to take her husband's nationality. This was proclaimed as \\"a big step taken in just a few years\\" at the CNFF meeting in 1922, but the CNFF also asked for reciprocity, the right for a foreign woman who had married a French man to automatically have the right to French citizenship. This eventually found its way into the law of 10 August 1927. In the postwar period the CNFF prepared arguments for reform of the laws to make it easier to submit paternity suits, while retaining the mother's right to custody of the child. In 1919 the CNFF felt women should contribute to the \\"struggle against depopulation\\", and demanded improvements in aid to large families and in child welfare services. They also demanded that women should have equal access to work and equal pay whether or not they were married or had children. Some feminists noted that schemes where the father received child support payments were unlikely to achieve the desired effect. The CNFF issued a position paper in 1919 that demanded an end to the legal disadvantages to which married women were subject, allowing them to make decisions without the approval of their husband, and demanded equal parental rights with any disagreement to be decided in court. thumb In 1922 Avril de Sainte-Croix succeeded Julie Siegfried as president of the CNFF, holding this position until 1932 when she was replaced by Marguerite Pichon-Landry. In 1925 the CNFF had 125,000 members. Sainte-Croix campaigned in 1927 to have women admitted to the police force. She presided over the CNFF's √âtats-G√©n√©raux du F√©minisme congresses in 1929, 1930 and 1931. These congresses focused in successive years on women's legal rights, economic standing and position in the colonies. In 1929 the Estates General of Feminism endorsed child allowances. Marguerite Pichon- Landry (1878‚Äì1972) chaired the Legislation section of the CNFF from 1914 to 1927, and was secretary-general from 1929 to 1932. She was president from 1932 to 1952. Pichon-Landry was awarded the medal of the resistance and was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor. =Post World War II= Marie-H√©l√®ne Lefaucheux (1904‚Äì64) was active in the CNFF after World War II. Lefaucheux was also very active in the Association of Women of the French Union (Association des Femmes de l'Union Fran√ßaise), and served as a link between this organization and the CNFF. Lefaucheux was president of the CNFF from 1954 to 1964, and president of the International Council of Women from 1957 to 1963. She was also a member of the secretariat of the Commission on Women of the United Nations and the French delegation to the United Nations. She achieved major advances for African women. Fran√ßoise Bouteiller, president of the CNFF in 1998, testified to the praise given to Lafaucheux by women she had met when she toured Africa for the council in 1975. The Foundation Marie-H√©l√®ne Lefaucheux was established to assist African women. In 1962 the CNFF joined the European Center of the International Council of Women, established in 1962. The CNFF campaigned against social ills including alcoholism, prostitution and the explosion of pornography in the 1970s. The CNFF works discreetly, and with mostly middle-aged members has a bourgeois image. It is today the oldest active French feminist association. The CNFF today has an Executive Committee of which one third is renewed every three years, elected by the General Assembly of the affiliated associations and individual members. The General Assembly is the decision-making body. The Executive Committee has a president and five vice-presidents, a secretary general and deputy secretary general, a treasurer and assistant treasurer. The goal of the CNFF in collaboration with its member organizations is to affirm the place and role of women in society, to ensure respect for their rights, and to contribute to building a united world where women are fairly represented.

Her father, Jules Lessore, also decorated pottery but was primarily a marine painter, he had exhibitions at the Royal Academy and Paris Salon. Powell studied calligraphy at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. \\"She became highly skilled and well known, illuminating some of William Morris‚Äô incomplete work, and extending her interests to decorative designs and the painting of furniture for Ernest Grimson\\". Ada's artistic interests were therefore very much encouraged by her family and she had many roots to the pottery company Wedgwood. Moreover, her sister, Th√©r√®se Lessore, was a painter and founder member of the London Group and then also designed for Wedgwood in the 1920s and her brother Frederick was a portrait sculptor who opened the Beaux Arts Gallery. She married Alfred Hoare Powell on Thursday, 6 September 1906 who then became her artistic partner within her career also. Career After her marriage to Powell the couple pursued a career with Wedgwood together after setting up their studio in 1907 at 20 Red Lion Square in Bloomsbury, London. Wedgwood sought to offer a new product range which, after its success, lead to the couple receiving money towards a studio to work, two assistants in London and a studio in the Wedgwood factory. Their brief was to developed the art wares within the company. Their progressive style was sought by the company to mass-produce works which coincided with the arts and crafts movement. Some of their work was jointly signed however a lot of her work was individual as she preferred calligraphic and heraldic motifs. The couple were well known in the field of the arts and exhibited in many events such as: Arts and Crafts Exhibition at Grafton Galleries, 1906; Hampstead Exhibition, 1914; Decorative Arts of Great Britain and Ireland Exhibition at the Louvre,1914;the Paris Exhibition, 1925 as well as yearly in their studio. Powell suggested the reintroduction of classic eighteenth century designs into a new Wedgwood collection hosted in Liverpool, which led to a lot of external approval and proved to be a commercial success, with the Staffordshire Sentinel commenting on their 'fresh style of decorated pottery'. The patterns included; 'Vine', 'Oak Leaf', and 'Crimped Ribbon and Wreath' and were sold to famous retailers such as Dunbar Hay and Harrods. Most of her designs were hand painted and a lot of her patterns were derived from nature in a calligraphic fashion. Some of her designs were extremely complex and required modification by the art director at the time but were critically acclaimed by many.

Together with his brother Captain Ernesto C. Uriburu and Ernesto's wife, Elena Murray de Uriburu Per√≥, Bobby sailed the oceans aboard \\"El Gaucho\\", a 50-foot ketch that took the Uriburu brothers in several trans-Atlantic trips around the world, to Europe, North America, South America, and Africa. Armed conflict in the Middle East prevented them from getting to Asia and complete their trip around the world, as they had originally planned. The Uriburu Per√≥ brothers wanted their ship to be built exclusively using wood from Argentine native trees, and instructed the shipbuilder Lorenzo Parodi, Enresto's childhood friend, to use lapacho and viraro for the boat's keel, peterib√≠ for the cover and algarrobo for the boat's ribs. The sails were knitted with cotton from Chaco, a province in Northern Argentina. The boat \\"El Gaucho\\" displaced 28 tons and had a total length of 15 meters (50 feet), its max beam of 4.30 mts., a draft of 2.15 mts. It was designed by the prestigious designer Manuel M. Campos and built in the shipyard of Parodi Hnos. located in Tigre, province of Buenos Aires. It took the Uriburus from Buenos Aires through the Mediterranean and to the Suez Canal and then to New York, following Columbus' route from Palos, Spain, to San Salvador. The Uriburu brothers were close friends of King Juan of Spain, who also loved sailing and with whom the Uriburu brothers used to sail together. The Uriburu brothers sailed over 67,000 nautical miles aboard El Gaucho, and their adventures abroad were reflected in the 1957 book \\"Seagoing Gaucho\\" authored by Ernesto Uriburu (entitled \\"67,000 millas a bordo de El Gaucho\\") ''' A Maiden Trip that entered into History El Gaucho's maiden trip was remarkably significant, since it was also the first historical reconstruction of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus. It lasted from 1946 to 1948, when the Uriburus sailed for 27,508 nautical miles, having invited Lieutenant of Corvette Julio √Ålvaro V√°zquez as navigator and were accompanied by Lobo Britos. They visited 14 countries and, upon returning to Argentina, they raised the flag of Castile and Leon upon their arrival, which was later donated to the Naval Museum of Tigre. The Uriburu brothers used to say that they inspiration for this historical trip had come from a combination of literature and history, since they had been asked to translate \\"The Ships of Columbus\\" by Mart√≠nez Hidalgo into English by Howard Chapelle. From 1951 to 1952, El Gaucho took part of the Havana-San Sebasti√°n regatta, covering the 18,232 nautical miles between Cuba and Spain with the Uriburus joined by Lieutenant of Corvette Roald Kolliker Frers. In 1954-1955, their navigator was Pedro Margalot and in the year 1959-60 on a 6,984-mile voyage, the navigator was Jorge Goul√∫ and, later, don Pedro Margalot, one of best navigators that El Gaucho had. In its third trip, El Gaucho took part for the second time in the 1954-1955 Havana-San Sebasti√°n regatta, in which it performed significantly better than in the previous regatta. El Gaucho finished in the 3rd position, having taken 36 days and 22 hours to complete the trip that had begun in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where a rather large storm that delayed them for 19 days, breaking the stick. El Gaucho sailed to Trinidad Island, as the Uriburus were waiting for the hurricane season to pass. After three months there, they sailed to Curacao, Jamaica, and Santiago de Cuba. From Miami, they sailed through the Intracostal route to Annapolis. On that trip, they delivered a painting (portrait) of Admiral Guillermo Brown to the Annapolis Naval School. Back in Miami, they sailed to Havana and then to San Sebasti√°n. El Gaucho took the Uriburus in several voyages across the South Atlantic ocean, the North Atlantic ocean, the Caribbean sea, the Mediterranean sea, the Ionian Sea, the Tyrrhenian sea, the Red sea and the Cantabrian sea. The Uriburus were awarded countless trophies, among which are the 1947 Blue Water Medal of the Cruising Club of America (CCA), the 1951 TransOceanic Pennant of the Cruising Club of America (CCA) and the 1956 John Parkinson Memorial Trophy, also from the Cruising Club of America (CCA). An interesting fact is that at a ceremony held at the City Island Yacht Club in New York, the Gaucho crew was given a personal flag of Sir Thomas Lipton, the most persevering challenger of the America Cup, as a symbol of sports friendship between the two countries. Sir Lipton's flag was hoisted at the top of the main pole of the Gaucho to celebrate the start of the races for this cup. The flag is made of wool, green and white, and it is said that Thomas hoisted it in his Shamrock in numerous attempts to reconquer the cup for England.

Snow Scout Environment Training Centre, at Victoria Point, near Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, is a noted ecological area within Redland City. Owned and managed by the Scout Association of Australia, Queensland Branch, the 39 hectares (96 acres) is home to a variety of habitats along Eprapah Creek to its north. Its value is recognised as a declared environmental reserve by the local city council, and designated as a Scout Centre of Excellence for Nature and Environment (SCENES) site. It is possibly the only Scout campsite in the world devoted principally to environmental education. Located at the intersection of Colburn Avenue, and Cleveland- Redland Bay Road, Victoria Point, the property was named for the creek travelling through its bounds. The name Eprapah is believed to be a corrupted form of the Biblical word Ephratah or 'fruitful land'.  Environmental aspects  Mount Cotton, 2014 The area is one of several areas of preserving environmental importance in Redland City, including Venman Bushland National Park and the nearby Girl Guide-run Kindilan Outdoor Education and Conference Centre. Additional to its indigenous, European, and Scouting heritage, Eprapah is home to koalas, together with a variety of ecosystems (riparian, estuarine, rainforest). The site is bounded to the north by Eprapah Creek, and forms a wildlife corridor from Mount Cotton. It is estimated the area is frequented by 120 species of plants, 125 birds, 24 mammals, 50 fish and other aquatic animals, 21 reptiles, and at least 60 species of insects. Eprapah and the creek have been subject to scientific research including hydrological surveys and koala tracking studies. = Catchment areas = With the increase in urban density from agriculture to residential areas, Eprapah supports and complements the creek and area's ecological importance. Coast-side of the property is the Victoria Point Environmental Precinct, going to the edge of the Moreton Bay Marine Park. To the east is the egret colony wetlands. Bounded by houses, the paperbark tea-tree-fringed lowlands are the avarian home to egrets, magpie geese, osprey, whistling kites, all varieties of ibis. It is also the roosting area for a bat colony. Accessed from along Egret Drive, via Point O'Halloran Road, there are no established tracks for visitors. Redland City Council is the custodian of this rare site, and it is maintained by the community bushcare volunteers. To the north-east, the Point Halloran Conservation Area is accessed from Orana Street, via Point O'Halloran Road.The point and conservation area are Port Halloran, while the road is Point O'Halloran. The name Halloran was in use prior to the 1930s, but appears the name was interchangeable. Purchased in 1990, and opened in 1995, with a car park, and raised wet weather shelter, there are two walking circuits, and was billed as a 'koala ecotourism sanctuary'. A raised boardwalk takes visitors through freshwater reed vegetation, towards Aspect Drive (parts of the boardwalk are closed for repair by March 2015). The second walk of is signposted to explain the changing vegetations of swamp she-oak (Casuarina sp.) forest and mixed woodland, to the edge of mangrove tidal mudflats. The area is well populated with large arboreal termite mounds, reflecting the waterlogged soils. A bushlands refuge also exists upstream of Eprapah, on a southern tributary of Eprapah Creek, on Elysian Street, Victoria Point. Further upstream is the Sandy Creek Conservation Area beside Double Jump Road, Mount Cotton. = Geography = Eprapah Creek in the mangrove tidal zone Eprapah is predominantly flat as it tends to the coastal edge of a water course that commences in the nearby weathered granitic outcrop of the tall Mount Cotton. Soils are reflective of an area forming the creek entrance to a bay, including gleyed clays, alluvial deposits, and across the majority of the site, podsoiled loam. Characterised by a short-lived freshwater flushing, and little or no dry season flow, the Eprapah Creek's estuarine zone to the north east is classified as wet and dry tropical/subtropical. A sewage treatment plant also discharges into the creek. The development of the Victoria Point Shopping Centre area in the vicinity has greatly increased water run-off through the site. With roofs and bitumen-covered car parks, the non-porous surfaces has seen periods of rainfall turn the sedate riverlet to Eprapah Creek turn into a torrent, with an associated increase in jetsam. Given the various ecosystems existing in a small area, surrounded by increasing pressures of urbanisation, results in Eprapah having great environmental interest and local value. = Vegetation = With sandy ridges of low sclerophyll forest, there are also other vegetation types present of rainforest remnants, sheoak or Casuarina sp. forest stands, Melaleuca swamps, salt meadows, and mangrove stands. The site hosts one of the important food trees of the koala, Queensland's faunal emblem, is the blue gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis). Other species around include the scribbly gum (Eucalyptus signata). The beautiful golden-flowering Eprapah wattle (Acacia fimbriata var perangusta) was previously considered to be a species in its own right, but is now considered to be an extreme form of another species, the Brisbane golden wattle or fringed wattle. It can be distinguished by the dimensions of the phyllodes, gland position, and the flower colour. Certain patches of the site have had specific plantings where weeds have been removed. Representative of the local area, the site has battled overgrowths of non-native plant pests such as Lantana camara and groundsel (Baccharis halimifolia), as well as mosquitoes and ticks. The site committee has an eradication plan removing from site invaders such as Camphor laurel trees, Asparagus fern, and plants not native to the area. Much propagation of ornamental plant species is occurring through the birds having eaten the fruits from surrounding areas. There are some issues caused by illegal dumping on the property's peripheral. = Fauna = One of Redland City's koalas The Eprapah link wildlife corridor from Mount Cotton along Eprapah Creek allows the relative unencumbered movement of fauna, and encouraging biodiversity within the Redlands. Established in 1990 in a joint venture between Scouts and the shire council, it also includes another Scout property, Karingal. Eprapah itself is home to koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus), bandicoots (Isodon macrourus), black-tailed swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor), grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), kookaburras, large arboreal termite mounds, and a sea eagle. Koalas in eastern Australia are being classified as vulnerable and added to the threatened species list. Numbers have dropped by forty percent in Queensland and by a third in New South Wales over the past twenty years. Subject to increasing pressures brought about by urbanisation (such as roads, dogs) causing habitat fragmentation, overcrowding at Eprapah has seen a drop in the population due to loss of or over-eating of available food trees. They have also become susceptible to various diseases including chlamydia. Habitat research has also occurred on the site over the years. For example, koalas have been captured, their health checked, and radio collars fitted. The freshwater area is also home to the near-threatened tusked frog (Adelotus brevis). The only Australian frog where the male is larger than the female of the species, they have a distinctive 'tok-tok' clucking sound. Habitat encroachment, introduced fish, and a fatal skin disease fungus have contributed to their vulnerability. The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) once resided in the creek pond near Cleveland-Redland Bay Road, but increased turbidity and lessening water quality has meant the animal has not been sighted for some years. For migratory birds, the property is also within the East Asian‚ÄìAustralasian Flyway, and the Moreton Bay Ramsar wetlands. Within east of Eprapah is an egret colony wetlands at Victoria Point. The standing pond, supplied and flushed with rains, contains a variety of aquatic life include Gambusia fish and other species, whirligig beetles, backswimmers, dragonfly nymphs, and mayfly nymphs. The tidal part of Eprapah Creek of course is home to fish, molluscs, and crabs.  Indigenous heritage  The home of the Koobenpul tribe and part of the Jagera/Yagera language group people, Eprapah was part of their range from Redland Bay (Talwarrapin, or cotton wood tree that was endemic to the area) to the Brisbane River (Mairwar). Victoria Point's Aboriginal name of Warra Warra possibly means mussels, while Coochiemudlo refers to the red rock that forms the small island. A midden was discovered on-site but its location has since been lost. Many plants at Eprapah were used by the Aboriginal people, including the red ash or soap tree (Alphitonia excelsa) as a poison, the edible and crunchy small fruit of the lillypilly (Syzygium smithii), black bean or Moreton Bay chestnut (Castanospermum australe) as a food source (after long treatment), and the paper bark (Melaleuca sp.) for carrying containers amongst other uses. A native food garden has been established at the south- west corner of the property, near the Mungara visitor centre.  European presence  The area including Eprapah, prior to Queensland becoming its own colony in 1859, was used for stocking cattle. Victoria Point was named in the 1840s, surveyed in 1859, with 'Eprapah Creek' becoming a post office at Holzapfel's store in 1890. The Colburn family,Daniel William Colburn has also been reported with a surname of Colbourn. giving their name to the road now acting as the southern border of the property, settled in the 1860s. Mostly farmers, other activities in the area included timber-getting. Nearby Link Road served as the log rafting area, to be floated to the mills at Cleveland and Wellington Point. Sugar plantations, custard apples, grapes, passion fruit, pawpaws, pineapple, tomatoes, cabbages, cucumbers constituted some of the farming activities. The market gardens supplied the Sydney and Melbourne with fresh seasonal pineapples. As the divide between the Tingalpa and Cleveland local government divisions, financial debates commenced in 1898 about the construction of a road bridge over Eprapah Creek. The bridge was later improved in 1924. Eprapah continued to be used as a district name until about 1915. The 1930s continued to see Victoria Point as a popular holiday destination, with trips to Coochiemudlo Island. Farming and tourism continued as the main post-World War II activities, when in the 1970s, crop farming progressed to flower growing. Throughout this period, Eprapah remained intact as a bushland property.  Scouting heritage  Flagpole, 1928 In April 1928, the property of Eprapah was purchased with money from the Bob Monteith Memorial Fund trust. Robert Henry Monteith (born 1892) was killed in action at the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin, France, on 2 September 1918.Born in Brisbane in 1891, Bob Monteith was the only son of Henry Monteith (1862‚Äì1930) and Katie Rose Waldie (1867‚Äì1954). After studying at the Brisbane Grammar School in 1906, he became a stockbroker, residing at his father's Ironside Estate, Toowong, before enlisting on 31 May 1915, aged 23. Serving with the army service corps at Gallipoli, he then went with the 26th Battalion to France, and was mentioned in dispatches for his leadership. He is buried in Peronne, Somme, France. Henry Monteith in June 1924, as chairman of the directors of the Brisbane Newspapers and involved in Scouting administration, gave ¬£5000 to the Boy Scouts' Association, as a memorial to their son. His father was involved in the Scouting movement and the parents created the deed in trust remembering their son. The thirty-nine hectare site hosts a separate local Scouting entity, the Victoria Point Scout Group. The current group was formed in 1969 and group operates from a former World War II military hut which originally served as a hospital at Greenslopes. Additional to a warden's cottage and local Scout den, the three main structures are the sleeping shelter ('bunkhouse'), the 1974 Grey Owl activity shelter and associated 1976 Biolab study shelter, and the 1993 Mungara visitor museum. Mungara is a restored on-site hand-made brick whitewashed cottage, now fulfilling the functions of meeting room, educational facility, and site museum. The name itself is the local indigenous word for the Queensland Blue Gum tree. The Grey Owl shelter was destroyed by fire in January 2019. The former Westpac Bank of the 1982 Australian Scout Jamboree held at Collingwood Park, Queensland became the site's warden's cottage. It was the residence of several on-site caretakers. After falling into a state of disrepair, the building was demolished 1 July 2015. Its present purpose is encompassed by aspects of the generally universal Scout Promise and Law, * A Scout is a friend to animals (the Australian 6th of 10 laws; c. 1910-). * A Scout cares for natural resources (the Australian 8th of 9 laws; 1973-) * A Scout cares for the environment (the Australian 10th law, 1990s) The Australian Scout Environment Charter sets out eight positions on how a scout can care for the environment, including: Taking part in activities and projects that encourage education through nature and the environment, learning about nature and the environment, and action for nature and the environment. The Scouting movement's founder, Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, wrote many references to the importance of the environment and the education value of the environment: * For those who have eyes to see and ears to hear, the forest is at once a laboratory, a club and a temple. * As a Scout, you are the guardian of the woods. A Scout never damages a tree by hacking it with his knife or axe. It does not take long to fell a tree, but it takes many years to grow one, so a Scout cuts down a tree for a good reason only ‚Äì not just for the sake of using his axe. For every tree felled, two should be planted. * Travel and reading and Nature study are all part of self-education. * By continually watching animals in their natural state one gets to like them too well to shoot them. The whole sport of hunting animals lies in the woodcraft of stalking them, not in the killing. = 1928 to 1953 = Training course advice, 1937 The centre was the State's leader training centre although youth member camping was permitted. Leader training was conducted in other locations in Queensland too, but Eprapah was the principal establishment. The first training course was on 4 June 1928. Leaders would draw their rations from an area now known as the Beaver Shelter, and also marked by the stumps of the cook's table, and a dining seat area. Youth member activities included training patrol leaders for emergency responses, constructing bridges, rafting, Scouts' own (religious observance), and water fights. Baden-Powell visited Queensland in May 1912, March 1931, and briefly in December 1934. It was on his second visit on 26 March 1931 that his shoe print was immortalised in concrete at Eprapah. A copy is now in place, with the original held at the Scout Museum at Baden-Powell Park, Samford, Queensland. The State's governor, Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, also visited the site as the Chief Scout of Queensland through the 1930s. The first of the site's two totem poles, the pole and notice board, an owl was carved during a November 1931 training course, and at its foot, B.-P.'s boot print. The chapel area was fenced off to stop wandering cattle. A large buttress stump was capped in concrete and the Scout badge with 'Old Scouts' set within (today, the concrete cap remains). Various teams continued their improvements to the training ground, engaging in building construction and pioneering works. 'By 1933, '[i]n between times of clearing lantana and carrying out the preliminary surveys for the draining of swamps, the Rovers and Men Scouts [of Brisbane] have been busy on the erection of a gate of typically Scouty design at the entrance of their section of Eprapah. Above the lintel of the gate will be the figure of a crocodile, carved out of a log of wood. A forked end will represent the paws, in which pointed pegs will appear as fearsome teeth. A swishing branch will serve as a tail to the wooden 'monster'.' An old scout hall was moved from Redland Bay to Eprapah in 1934. Eagle totem pole, carved 1937 In 1937, the campfire circle was accentuated by an eagle totem pole. Rover Scouts from Sandgate spent two years carving a life-sized eagle with a body was from local bloodwood, and wings of beech. The eagle, painted in bronze, stood wide and on top of a totem pole. Light from the fire reflected off the eagle. Charles Smethurst Snow (1882‚Äì1953) Various Scouting personalities would later lend their names to various structures on the property, as well as to Scouting locations and events in Queensland, including: * Charles Smethurt 'Chief' Snow ( ‚Äì ). A watchmaker and jeweller, Snow became a scoutmaster with one of the first four Brisbane troops in 1908. He was elected the first chief scoutmaster for Queensland (today, 'chief commissioner'), and encouraged the purchase of Eprapah. His name is also attached to a Scout district in north Brisbane, and the leader training centre at Samford. * Kenneth Alexander 'Kauri' Boyd (1905‚Äì1976 (aged 71)). The straight-standing Boyd was an optometrist, starting as a scoutmaster at Buranda continued to become an assistant international commissioner. * Thomas 'Grey Owl' Gloster (1855 ‚Äì 13 January 1941 (aged 86)). A Cleveland identity, Gloster was a soldier in the Royal Munster Fusiliers. * John Victor 'Running Stag' Marquis-Kyle ( ‚Äì 1981 (aged 83)). Marquis-Kyle's contributions to Eprapah included carving the poles for the Providore, and the owl totem pole. * Louis Varsey 'Beaver' Masters (1885 ‚Äì 15 May 1964 (aged 78)). A Scout district on the Sunshine Coast. Beaver Masters is interred at the then Sir Leslie Wilson campsite at Florence Bay, Magnetic Island, Townsville. * James Alfred 'Nebo' Manderson ( ‚Äì ). Manderson was a signwriter, Rotarian, Wolf Cub leader, and a known story-telling character. * David Thain 'Kiwi' Weir ( ‚Äì 1973 (aged 83)). With his trademark tobacco pipe, Weir rose to be the central Queensland region field commissioner, akela leader, and deputy camp chief (leader trainer roles). Since 1946, each Easter Scouts from Nambour to Bundaberg compete for the Kiwi Woggle (a huge animal's vertebra as the woggle on a standard Queensland scout scarf). = 1954 to 1972 = In late 1953, the Queensland Boy Scouts' Association purchased a camping property to be called Baden-Powell Park, on Cash Avenue, Samford. The Kulgun training ground was established for scout leaders. As a result, Gilwell training ceased at Eprapah, and items were transferred to B.-P. Park, such as the Eagle totem pole in 1955. Apart from its hiatus as a regular scouting activity site, a big fire went through the property scarring many trees and destroying structures. Part of the west side of the property was probably resumed to road development as the Cleveland-Redland Bay Road was widened. = 1973 to present = Freshwater ecology activities location In 1973 the property was resurrected for conservation field studies by the Scouting organisation. This resulted in the rezoning of Eprapah in 1975 by the Redland Shire Council for special purposes. Charles Smethurst Snow was the first chief commissioner of the League of Boy Scouts in Queensland, a primary instigator for the property purchase, a conservationist, and the scouting centre's name honours his memory. Site management has varied post-1973, and several Scouting formations influence its care and direction: * Branch commissioners. The leaders are responsible for Queensland-wide delivery of the Scouting programme in specific fields, in this instance, the environment. The inaugural BC was Dr Bernard Stone OAM ( ‚Äì ), Branch Commissioner for Conservation (1973-), together with his wife Anne Beatrice (OAM). Stone was a scientist with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and Scouting's National Advisor on Environmental Education for almost twenty years. Anne (1928‚Äì2010) was the daughter of 'Chief' Snow; * Friends of Eprapah; * Eprapah Scout Fellowship (in 2005, the Friends of Eprapah Scout Fellowship); and * State site committee. The outline still exists of a wooden suspension bridge built by the Manatunga Rover Crew (from Morningside, Brisbane) and Australian Army Reserve. The bridge was opened on 4 June 1978. Declared a Scout Centre of Excellence for Nature and Environment (SCENES) site prior to 1985, for a long time it was one of thirteen in the world, and the only one in the Southern Hemisphere. The Scout Association hosted the September 1985 week-long live-in Asia/Pacific Environmental Conservation Seminar ('APECS 85') for 33 Scouting and Guiding delegates from many countries. Presenters included Dr Bernard Stone (CSIRO), Dr Graham Saunders (Director, Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service), Dr Angela Arthington (School of Environmental Studies, Griffith University), and Dr Bob Johnson (Queensland Herbarium). The Mungara building had an extension that was officially opened on 19 December 2001. Additionally, a historic 'small silver plate in memory of Jimmy Tabau, Darnley Island's first Australian Native Scouter, was formally returned to Mungara by Branch Heritage Coordinator Tom Roberts. This plate survived Eprapah bushfires in the early 1960s, later was resurrected from ash and displayed at Samford for 16 years.' The 2011‚Äì2012 period saw the installation of a fauna exclusion fence, a high fence with smooth metal sheeting at the top, along the property perimeter, to prevent wildlife from leaving the property and entering public roads and endangerment. A heritage walk was opened in 2014, and signage marks the various historic Scouting features of Eprapah. The Scout's State Environment Education Team regularly conducts field day or weekend programmes for members of the Scout and Guide movements. The curriculum is based around the World Scout Environment Programme (formerly the World Conservation Badge) and other scout merit badgework. The activities include examining various aspects of the site's many ecosystems, pond dipping, removal of stands of weeds and area regeneration through tree planting, and night-time spotlighting. For both accessibility, and diversity exploration and appreciation, there are various tracks (generally identified by a colour) and board walks, including: * Koala Glade, covering a riverlet riparian zone to open forest; * Brown Trail, around the chapel area; * Green Trail, following Eprapah Creek; and * Blue Trail, from a riverlet riparian zone, along a raised boardwalk through the mangroves and salt marsh habitats. Several trails have numbered posts for points of interest, corresponding to information in a visitation booklet. Near the corner of Colburn Avenue and Cleveland-Redland Bay Road, there are also two activity areas of interest: * senses trail circuit, with plants of various textures; and * native plants arboretum of wild foods, medicinal, and endangered plants (established 2001). Facilities today include a Scout camping area and a pack holiday shelter with bunk accommodation for over fifteen persons. Various non-Scouting groups have hired the facilities including artists weekends. The environmental reserve is maintained by members of the Scout Fellowship, persons undertaking community service as part of a judicial correction order, and other interested persons. Members of the community can join the fellowship, and also consider involvement in the site committee.

She is known for her work highlighting discrimination against women and explicitly presenting feminist perspectives in her work. Biography =Personal life= Dilara Begum is known more by her nickname Jolly than her official name. She studied painting and printmaking at Government Arts College, Chittagong (BFA 1981); then gained her Master of Fine Arts, Painting at the Institute of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka, in 1984. In 1991, she gained a Post Diploma in Print Making in Santiniketan, West Bengal, with a scholarship from the Indian Government. Jolly said in an interview that her mother was the first inspiration for her to overcome social barriers, and that her mother used to say \\"women should become educated, and to achieve a voice of their own they need to be economically self-sufficient\\" In 2011, Jolly and her husband were involved in a bus accident which killed internationally acclaimed filmmaker Tareque Masud, ATN News CEO Mishuk Munier, and three others. The group were traveling in a micro-bus traveling to Manikganj town to meet the deputy commissioner to seek permission for shooting Tareque's latest film, Kagojer Phool, after visiting a shooting spot in Shibalaya Upazila, when a passenger bus collided head on with their micro-bus on the Dhaka-Aricha Highway at Ghior in Manikganj. Jolly suffered a fractured hand. Career Jolly began her career as a printmaker. In 2014, she held an exhibition entitled \\"Threads of Testimony\\" at the Bengel Art Lounge in Dhaka looking at the condition of women in the garment industry in Bangladesh. =Major themes= Dilara Begum Jolly's works highlight the inner journey as well as harsh realities of the women's life. Different strong women characters such as Jamila of Syed Wali Ullah's novel 'Lalsalu' have influenced her. Her series work Embryo Withdrawn presents an urge of a mother to hide her teenage daughter, who is a victim of society's patriarchy, into her ovary. 'It is a true story of one of my relatives. After expressing that utmost and unreal solution to keep her daughter in peace the mother died immediately. The memory still haunts me,' said Jolly. Jolly has focused on a number of social issues in both specific to Bangladesh, and globally: beginning with Lalshalu in 1985, in 1996 she portrayed the tragedy of Nurjahan, a victim of ‚ÄòFatwa‚Äô who killed herself after she was pronounced guilty of adultery by the village council and publicly stoned, and including work on the tragic story of Rumana Manzur, teacher of the Dhaka University, blinded by her husband in 2011 because she wanted to continue her studies abroad against his wishes, and the young female garment workers of Tazreen Fashion who were burnt alive in a factory fire in 2012. In her paintings, Jolly focuses on the reality of the situation of women in a male-dominated society; her way of protesting against this system has more to do with satire, ridicule and incisive irony than direct statement. The changed perspective of world politics after 9/11, the violence of the unfair Iraq War and the realization that mothers were the main victims of the war led to Jolly's work on the female reproductive system and on the topic of motherhood; the senselessness of bringing new life into a world made unfit for living and women's lack of choice in the matter prompted her to work on the embryo.

The tests between 1971‚Äì1975 were known as the DICE trials. The tests were conducted by scientists from Porton Down, initially using Zinc cadmium sulfide (ZnCds) as a simulated agent. Early results clearly showed that one aircraft flying along the coast while spraying its agent could contaminate a target over 100 miles away, over an area of 10,000 square miles. This method of Biological warfare attack and the test program to study it was known as the Large Area Coverage (LAC) concept. In the early 1960s, Porton Down was asked to expand the scope of their tests to determine if using a live bacteria instead of ZnCds would significantly alter the results.

When light hits the retina, about one-tenth of a second goes by before the brain translates the signal into a visual perception of the world. Changizi asserts that the human visual system has evolved to compensate for neural delays by generating images of what will occur one-tenth of a second into the future. This foresight enables humans to react to events in the present, enabling humans to perform reflexive acts like catching a fly ball and to maneuver smoothly through a crowd. Although not the first to suggest this idea, he was the first to show how the idea can explain and unify a large variety of perceptual illusions. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/03640210802035191/abstract;jsessionid=B857A7C7D319527C0C8FD4E1E24EB6A4.f03t03 Changizi MA, Hsieh A, Nijhawan R, Kanai R, Shimojo S, 2008, \\"Perceiving the present and a systematization of illusions,\\" Cognitive Science 32(3):459-503] https://www.amazon.com/Vision-Revolution-Research-Overturns- Everything/dp/1935251767/ Changizi MA, 2009, The Vision Revolution, Benbella.

In an attempt to support the garrison of Louisbourg, who were facing an impending siege, the French Atlantic Fleet sent a number of squadrons and ships to sea during the spring of 1758. To intercept these ships, Royal Navy squadrons maintained a close blockade of their main port at Brest. In April a British squadron including HMS Intrepid, HMS Dorsetshire and HMS Achilles was cruising off the French Biscay Coast when a lone sail was sighted to the southwest. Dorsetshire, commanded by Captain Peter Denis was sent to investigate, discovering the ship to be the French ship of the line Raisonnable sailing to Louisbourg. In a fierce battle, Dorsetshire managed to inflict heavy casualties on the French ship and force her captain, Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan, to surrender. Action In 1758 the British Royal Navy Channel Fleet and the French Navy Atlantic Fleet were contesting control of the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic Ocean during the Seven Years' War, which had broken out between Britain and France in 1755 over colonial dominance in North America. For the French Navy the priority was maintaining their lines of supply to the major French Canadian fortress of Louisbourg, which was soon to fall under siege. To support the city, the French Atlantic Fleet sent squadrons and single ships into the Atlantic to bring supplies and reinforcements to the garrison and the Royal Navy in turn deployed forces to intercept these missions.Clowes, p.182 One squadron deployed in close blockade at Brest in April 1758 was commanded by Captain Edward Pratten in HMS Intrepid. On 19 April, a sail was sighted to the southwest and Pratten detached the 70-gun HMS Dorsetshire under Captain Peter Denis to investigate.Clowes, p.299 The ship proved to be the 64-gun French ship of the line Raisonnable under Captain Louis-Armand-Constantin de Rohan, Chevalier de Rohan and Prince de Montbazon. Realising the strength of the French ship, Pratten subsequently detached the 60-gun HMS Achilles under Captain Samuel Barrington to support Dorsetshire. Before Achilles could arrive, Denis succeeded in bringing Dorsetshire alongside the French ship and in a fierce broadside engagement successfully forcing Rohan to strike his colours. Barrington's ship only arrived in range in the final minutes, confirming the French surrender. French casualties were heavy, with 61 killed and 100 wounded, while losses on Dorsetshire numbered 15 killed and 21 wounded, one of whom subsequently died. Raisonnable was subsequently repaired and commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name, serving until she was accidentally wrecked at Martinique in February 1762.Clowes, p.311 The Siege of Louisbourg went ahead in June 1758, and the city fell the following month, blockaded from reinforcement by the Royal Navy.Clowes, p.183 References Bibliography * Category:Naval battles involving France Category:Naval battles involving Great Britain Category:Conflicts in 1758 Category:Naval battles of the Seven Years' War Category:Military history of the Bay of Biscay ","title":"Action of 29 April 1758"},{"id":"45617705","text":"Madeleine Carpentier (3 February 1865 ‚Äì 13 September 1949) was a French painter.

She studied at the Bradford School of Art under Fred Stead and Harry Butler. Early years Margaret Firth was born in Bradford. Her father, Edwin Firth was a textile manufacturer and part of the business community in late Victorian Bradford. Margaret's mother, Sarah Florence, came from an artistic background and passed on her love of fabric and embroidery to Margaret. The Firths were keen gardeners and Margaret was encouraged to study plants and flowers. Margaret also remembered a childhood visit to see Anna Pavlova perform as an important early experience. In 1906, when Margaret was eight, her mother was diagnosed with Graves' Disease and Margaret assumed the responsibility of caring for her at an early age. Education When she was young Margaret was taken care of by a live-in governess. Shortly after her mother was taken ill Margaret was sent to a private day school for girls at Spring Gardens, Off Manningham Lane, Bradford. In 1909 she started at Bradford Grammar School for Girls. Margaret found it hard to adjust to school life. She was a quiet student and painting and drawing did not feature in the school's everyday curriculum. Recognising her artistic talent Margaret's parents encouraged her to apply for a place at Bradford School of Art when she left school in summer 1914. She started at the school the following September, aged 16, to study classes in Light, Shade and Painting. Margaret found it difficult to commit to her studies because of her mother's health and had to leave. Margaret returned to the School of Art in 1919 after a three-year break and managed to complete a full academic year before she was forced to leave again. She again returned in 1921 for a further 2 terms before another break. Due to her sporadic attendance Margaret was unable to sit and exams and did not gain a Diploma. During her time at Art School Margaret was taught by Fred Stead, who considered her an outstanding pupil. Stead was later replaced by Harry Butler who emphasised the importance of composition. Middle years After leaving Art School Margaret was encouraged to continue painting by her father. He built her a large studio at their home 'Bracken Wood'. Margaret continued to work to develop her technique but for the next twenty years she struggled to find time to paint. Unlike her contemporaries from the School of Art John Cooper, John Bickerdike and Richard Eurich, Margaret never considered leaving home for London to establish her career. In the mid 1920s Margaret was commissioned to design interiors for homes which provided a financial income. In the late 1930s Margaret's brother became seriously ill and the health of her mother's health worsened. Margaret's painted ceased altogether. Her brother died in 1940 followed by her mother in 1942. Margaret worked at the Hospital Support Depot in Ilkey to contribute to the war effort. When Edwin Firth died in 1948 Margaret was left alone, aged 50, with no family and few friends. She sold the family home and moved into an attic flat. The flat had a spare room which Margaret turned into a studio to begin to paint again. Later years After moving into her new flat Margaret became part of the local art scene which included Theo Moorman, W.T. Oliver, Dorothy Bradford and Maurice de Sausmarez. Margaret became active in the local art scene and in 1950 she was appointed Art Advisor to Ilkley Council and formed a committee to organise art exhibitions in the town. For the next twelve years Margaret sat on the committee which put together an ongoing programme of contemporary art exhibitions shown in the Winter Gardens. Margaret exhibited her work throughout Yorkshire from the early 1950s onwards. In 1950 Helen Kapp, the director of Wakefield Art Gallery, purchased \\"Tulips\\", the first work to enter a museum collection. Kapp later gave Margaret a solo exhibition. Ernest Musgrave, the Director of Leeds Art Gallery, exhibited twenty-five of Margaret's needlework pictures in the show 'Contemporary Painting, Sculpture and Crafts' in 1955. Margaret's work established a considerable reputation in Yorkshire during the 1960s, despite Margaret not wishing to promote herself. The opening of the Hawksworth Gallery in Ilkley led to three further exhibitions of Margaret's work between 1984 and 1987 and a touring retrospective exhibition initiated by Bradford Art Gallery in 1988.

The manor house known as Poltimore House survives in its 18th-century remodelled form, but has been dilapidated for several decades. A charity named the \\"Poltimore House Trust\\" has been established for the purpose of its restoration. The manor was situated within the historic Wonford Hundred and was largely coterminous with the parish of Poltimore and contained the village of Poltimore, north-east of the historic centre of the City of Exeter. It should not be confused with the eponymous Devon estate of Poltimore in the parish of Farway, east of Exeter. Poltimore was the principal seat of the Bampfylde family from to 1920. Descent The identification of the manor of Poltimore, later seat of the Bampfylde family, with a location mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 is problematical. The Domesday Book lists two estates, PULTIMORE, the first- listed of the five Devonshire holdings of the king's tenant-in-chief Haimeric of Arques, Pas de Calais, PicardyThorn & Thorn, part 2 (notes), 50:1 and PONTIMORE (sic), the 90th of the 176 Devonshire holdings of Baldwin the Sheriff (died 1090). According to Worthy (1896), neither corresponds to the Bampfylde's manor of Poltimore, which he suggests was not listed separately in the Domesday Book, but rather was parcel of one of the two Domesday Book royal manors named CLISTE, namely the one later known as \\"Clist Moins\\", now \\"West Clyst\\", in the parish of Broadclyst, in the historic Cliston hundred. This estate of \\"Clist Moins\\" was later held from the feudal barony of Okehampton, which later comprised the former fiefdom of Baldwin the Sheriff.Worthy; Thorn & Thorn, part 2 (notes), 16:92 The descent of the manor was as follows: =Baldwin the Sheriff (died 1090)= As recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 the first post-Norman Conquest holder of the manor was Baldwin the Sheriff (died 1090), whose fiefdom in Devon was the largest in that county,Thorn & Thorn, part 2 (notes), chap.16 recorded in the Domesday Book as comprising 176 holdings, including PONTIMORE (sic).Thorne & Thorne, 16:90 His tenants were the Canons of \\"St Mary's\\", as recorded in the Domesday Book. Worthy (1896) suggested that this religious establishment was St. Mary's Church in Rouen, Normandy, (i.e. Rouen Cathedral, Notre-Dame de Rouen) but Reichel rejected this suggestion and instead proposed that it was the Collegiate Church of St Mary, situated within the walls of Exeter Castle, which collegiate church is believed to have been founded by Baldwin.Thorne & Thorne, part 2 (notes) 16:89‚Äì92, quoting: Reichel, O.J., Transactions of the Devonshire Association, vol.30, p.283 =de Poltimore= Arms of de Poltimore: Azure, a griffin segreant orPole, p.497; Risdon, p.91 At some later period Poltimore was held by the de Poltimore family which took its name from the manor, as was usual at that time. They also held an estate in Glamorgan called Poltymore. The descent given by Pole (died 1635) was as follows:Pole, Sir William (died 1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, pp.230‚Äì1 *Stephan de Poltimore *Bartholemewe de Poltimore *Sir Richard de Poltimore *Sir Richard de Poltimore (son), who granted Poltimore to Simon de Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu (died 1316). =Montagu= Simon de Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu (died 1316) acquired the manor of Poltimore from Sir Richard de Poltimore and in 1297Pole, p.230, regnal date 26 Edward I sold it for ¬£200 to William Pontington, a Canon of Exeter Cathedral. =Pontington= William Pontington (died 1307),Worthy a Canon of Exeter Cathedral, purchased the manor of Poltimore in 1297 for the sum of ¬£200 from Simon de Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu (died 1316). William de Puntyngdon succeeded Thomas de Charleton as Archdeacon of Totnes on 28 September 1303, and had been Precentor of Exeter Cathedral in 1302. The origins of William Pontington are not recorded. According to Pole he gave Poltimore to John Baunfild (John Bampfield), whom he called in a Latin deed his alumnus (\\"foster-son, pupil, disciple\\"Cassell's Latin Dictionary, p.33), and who was the founder of the Bampfield/Bampfylde family of Poltimore. =Bampfield= Arms of Bampfylde: Or, on a bend gules three mullets argent John Bamfielde John Bamfielde of Poltimore and Weston Bampfylde, Somerset, married Ellinor Beauchamp, a daughter of Sir Humfrey Beauchamp of Ryme.

He was the son and heir of Sir Edward Bampfield and Elizabeth Wadham. His father died when Richard was an infant aged two, and he entered wardship, concerning which John Prince, (died 1723) relates a story \\"of undoubted credit\\":Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London, pp. 35‚Äì6 :It was thus, his father dying, the young gentleman fell a ward to some great person in the east- country, who seized upon him while he was very young, carryed him away to his own home. He being now possessed of his person and estate, some years after gave it out he was gone to travel (or the like pretence); insomuch, his relations and friends believing it to be true, looked no farther after him. So that concealing from him his quality and condition and preventing what he could any discovery thereof, his guardian bred him up as his servant and at last made him his huntsman. It happened that one of Mr Bampfeild's (sic) tenants, understanding something of this mistery, made it his business first to find him out and next to discourse with him about it, which in a little time he had an opportunity to do, when acquainting him with his birth and fortunes, it was agreed on between them that he should come at such a time and privately fetch him away. This he did accordingly and so retrieved the right heir of the family\\". Wotton (died 1766), later relates the story similarly, with extra details which identify the subject as Richard Bampfield:Wotton, 1771, pp.375‚Äì6 :\\"...but one of his tenants (being his nurse's husband) discovering where he was detained, made him acquainted with his fortune; the truth of which he convinced him of, by a remarkable mole which he had in his back, and brought him away privately to Brimpton, the seat of John Sydenham, Esq., who assiled him in his return to Poltimore, and soon after gave him his daughter in marriage. In confirmation of which, he lies at length, with a hound at his feet, under a monument in Poltimore church. Having received no account from the family, concerning this particular, I do not presume to give it as authentic.\\" He married Elizabeth Sydenham (died 1599), daughter of Sir John Sydenham of Brympton d'Evercy, Somerset.

He was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he became a Member, \\"in the quality of a Nobleman\\".Wotton, 1771 \\"How well he answered that title appeared from his very splendid way of living there, and that large and noble plate he left to his College when he went thence, which remained a long while after a monument of his munificence, until at length, with fome other pieces, it was solen away\\". He returned to Devon during the Commonwealth government of Oliver Cromwell, \\"But, having a vigorous soul, actuated, even then, with principles of loyalty to his sovereign, though in exile, and of duty to the church, then under a cloud, he became very industrious, with several other persns of honour and quality in these parts, for the happy restoration of both\\". His arrest was ordered by Cromwell's government, but he hid himself away successfully at Trill, a residence of his friend, Sir John Drake, Baronet. \\"Notwithstanding any theatening danger that might happen, his generous mind could not be affrighted from following his duty and honour\\", he joined in the signing of a Remonstrance drawn up at the quarter-sessions in Exeter which demanded a free Parliament, which was supported by much of that city's population. The Remonstrance was presented to Parliament by his uncle Thomas Bampfylde, Recorder of Exeter, and encouraged other towns and cities in England to do likewise. the like, \\"Whereby the army in and about London, consisting of fourteen thousand odd foot foldiers, were disperfed throughout the kingdom (of which fifteen hundred were sent to Exeter) to prevent the like insurrection as had happened there, elfewhere. Which disperfion, how much it facilitated General Monk's march into London but with seven thousand odd soldiers, and consequently, how greatly this bold and brisk address of our Country Gentlemen, promoted the happy Restoration of Church and State, which soon happened hereupon, is very obvious to observe, if not so easy for envy to acknowledge\\". It was \\"this great patriot\\" Sir Copleston Bampfield who later presented on behalf of the County of Devon a Petition of Right to General Monck, a fellow Devonian, who had landed in Devon with an army \\"to restore the nation to its right senses\\". For this he was imprisoned in the Tower of London by the Rump Parliament, but was soon released on the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. He was the first Sheriff of Devon appointed by King Charles II in 1661, \\"Which office Sir Coplestone executed with great splendor, in an extraordinary number of liveries and attendants\\"Wotton He served as MP for Devon. He was colonel of the Devon Militia until the time of Monmouth's invasion, when he retired due to ill health to be succeeded in the colonelcy by his son. He was at first a supporter of King William of Orange, but later opposed his rule, considering that \\"matters were carried beyond all imaginations, fearing a change would be made in the fundamental conftitution of the Government\\" and refused to pay the newly declared rates and taxes, which were therefore enforced on him by a levy of distress upon his goods. He died of gout aged 55 in 1691 at Warleigh and was buried in Poltimore Church. Before his death he charged his family strictly always to continue faithful to the religion of the established Church of England and to pay allegiance to the right heirs of the Crown. He married twice: *Firstly on 16 November 1655 to Margaret Bulkeley, daughter of Francis Bulkeley of Burgate, Hampshire, by whom he had two sons and a daughter: **Col.

Life and career Born Drucilla Glover in Ripon, North Yorkshire in 1924, Bowett attended the Queen Margaret's School, York before studying at the Harrogate School of Art under John Cooper, a pupil of Walter Sickert. She became a close friend of Hungarian artist Jean-Georges Simon during her time at Harrogate, and later worked alongside notable artists such as Henry Moore, Graham Sutherland, Terry Frost and Prunella Clough. She was an active member of the prestigious Midland Group - 'a regionally influential collective of Modernist painters based in Nottingham with links to the St Ives School and Wilhelmina Barns-Graham' \\\\- and through this formed an enduring friendship with its founding member, Evelyn Gibbs. She married John Bowett in 1943, whose death in 1994 inspired 'an extraordinary series of paintings' shown at the Pierrepoint Gallery, Nottinghamshire. Alongside her artistic career, Bowett had many public responsibilities including acting as 'committee member, then chair, of the governing bodies of Chesterfield and Loughborough Colleges of Art and Design', and was later elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Art Bowett's early work drew from antique, life drawing and industrial and pastoral landscape, with her focus at the Harrogate School of Art being on Fine Art. During her studies, she became profoundly influenced by the Hungarian artist Jean-Georges Simon, whose work 'opened her eyes to a wider European modern style of clean bright colour and formal discipline', and informed the 'confident abstraction' of her later work. An active member of The Midland Group, her paintings featured in many of their exhibitions held in Nottingham between 1940-60. During the 1950s, Bowett's work became increasingly abstractionist, with 'a hard-won clarity and abstraction of form [being] achieved during the 1960s in such paintings as Brown and Yellow and Wookery'. Bowett's paintings in her 1995 exhibition, 'Given Space', at the Cartwright Hall, Bradford, were described as having shown her to be 'a painter at the height of her powers...[showing] bravura displays of colour, light and form, about sensations of space, nearness and distance'. Bowett exhibited consistently over five decades, with exhibitions at the Royal Academy of Arts, the Paris Salon, the Royal Society of Arts and the Royal Society of Portrait Painters.

Taxonomy The genus was erected by Leopold Fitzinger in 1843, but placed in synonymy with Bufo by Albert G√ºnther in 1859. Subsequent work has considered Peltophryne either as a valid genus, a subgenus, or a synonym of Bufo.

Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, Warsaw Geta BrƒÉtescu (4 May 1926 ‚Äì 19 September 2018) was a Romanian visual artist with works in drawing, collage, photography, performance, illustration and film. In 2008 BrƒÉtescu received an honorary doctorate from the Bucharest National University of Arts for \\"her outstanding contributions to the development of contemporary Romanian art\\". BrƒÉtescu was artistic director of literature and art magazine Secolul 21. A major retrospective of her work was held at the National Museum of Art of Romania in December 1999. In 2015 BrƒÉtescu's first UK solo exhibition was held at the Tate Liverpool. In 2017, she was selected to represent Romania at the 57th Venice Biennale.  Biography  BrƒÉtescu studied at the Faculty of Letters, University of Bucharest, between 1945 and 1949 under George CƒÉlinescu and Tudor Vianu, and at the Academy of Fine Arts under Camil Ressu. She was expelled from the latter before completing her degree due to the rise of the Communist party - since her parents owned property, she was deemed 'of bad origins'. In 1969 she returned to university, and studied at the Institute of Fine Arts \\"Nicolae Grigorescu\\" until 1971. She studied literature alongside art, and a close relationship between art and writing is present in much of her work. The Romanian public sphere in the 1970s and 1980s was one of fragmented socialism, where radical forms of aesthetic provocation were not tolerated. This pressure of censorship pushed BrƒÉtescu and other artists to work solely within the privacy of their own studios. Perhaps the work most reflective of BrƒÉtescu's experience of censorship and politically motivated performances was her 1978 collage of provocative self-portraits titled Censored Self Portrait. In these photographs, BrƒÉtescu depicted herself with her mouth and eyes sealed by a paper strip, to metaphorically express her inability to speak freely in the current public sphere at the time. Following exclusion from her fine art course, BrƒÉtescu worked as an arts editor, illustrator and animator, and also carried out documentation trips both in Romania and abroad for the Artist's Union. Once she returned to university, as a fine art student she had access to a studio which became the subject of a series of works throughout the 1970s that looked at the studio as a place to redefine the self. In perhaps her most famous film, The Studio (1978), made with Ion Grigorescu in a new studio at the Artist's Union, she measures her size in the space, marking her place in the world. Other works by Bratescu from this period raise questions of self- identity and dematerialisation, such as the performance and photography work Towards White. In the 1980s BrƒÉtescu began working with textiles, describing this practice as 'drawing with a sewing machine'. BrƒÉtescu was interested in numerous literary figures, including Aesop, Faust and Medea. The latter, a somewhat anti-feminine figure who killed her children, was the subject of a series of textile works made using scraps of cloth given to BrƒÉtescu by her mother, reflecting BrƒÉtescu's complex relationship with feminism. Throughout BrƒÉtescu's works the line is a dominant feature, functioning as a mode of definition, measurement and movement, from the classical draughtsmanship of Hands (1974‚Äì76) to the body performing in space in The Studio (1978). Creating lines through material continued within BrƒÉtescu's practice within the series of collages Jeu des Formes (Game of Forms). In 2017 Romania's Culture Ministry selected BrƒÉtescu to represent Romania at the 57th Venice Biennale. She presented a piece of work entitled Geta BrƒÉtescu ‚Äî Appearances. She had participated in the Biennale twice before ‚Äì in 1960 as part of a group exhibition, and in 2013 at the Central Pavilion, alongside fellow Romanian artists »òtefan Bertalan and Andra Ursuta.

In her later work she often painted on wooden board rather than canvas and she had her first solo exhibition at the age of 63 before working long into her 90s.  Biography  Elisabeth Jessie Vellacott was born in Grays, Essex in 1905. Her father, Humphrey Vellacott, was a chartered accountant who later became a priest. This change in career meant that Elisabeth and her four brothers lived in Cambridge for much of their childhood. Vellacott studied at the Royal College of Art, London, where she was taught by Walter Thomas Monnington before returning to Cambridge to work as a textile maker and set designer. Amongst other projects she worked with her friend Gwen Raverat on sets and costumes for the University of Cambridge musical society. She featured in an episode of The South Bank Show, a television arts magazine show in 1984. She was the sister of the classicist and translator Philip Vellacott.  Painting  Her first solo show was at The Minories, Colchester in 1968 which was followed by exhibitions at New Arts Centre, London and a retrospective at Warwick Arts Trust. She was influenced by Russian icon painting, Indian textiles, Persian miniatures, Chinese and Japanese ceramics. Her later work on panels were characterised by a thin white wash and pale pastel tones.

She is a graduate of the Danish school of art photography Fatamorgana (1996) and the International Center of Photography in New York (1997).* Haslund-Christensen‚Äôs long-term projects are performative and documentary, taking their impetus from the specific contexts in which they are created, for example anthropological ‚Äòexpeditions‚Äô (the artist as explorer in Natives: The Danes), in the basement of a police station (posing as a mugshot photographer for Who‚Äôs Next?) or as a traveling photographer or camerawoman in local communities (in Heroes, To Tingberg with Love and Hope & Fear - work in progress). A common political thread throughout her oeuvre is addressing stereotypes and the role of the media - past and the present - in their creation.

Whilst each project has its own conscious, visual and often staged film or photographic form ‚Äì based on the specific historical or contemporary media it interrogates ‚Äì each is motivated by her meetings with people, investigating the gap between their hopes, lives and dreams and the apparently incessant need for the racial, gendered or religious ‚Äòother‚Äô in a global climate of increasing fear.

Plot In a medieval fantasy kingdom, two orphans, May and his sister Martha, live in poverty. A group of robbers kidnap May to use his magic talent: he feels sick when surrounded by gold, therefore he can feel gold from a long distance. Martha goes on a quest to find her brother. She is soon joined by a travelling scientist, Orlando. Together, the two wander through various fantastic countries. They visit a city built on the back of a dragon, and see it burnt down when the dragon wakes. In another city, they are sentenced to death for starting a bar brawl. They manage to escape from prison using hang-glider Orlando invented. Finally they land in a country hit by Black Death, which is personified as a witch in black. Orlando sacrifices himself to stop the plague. Years later, Martha finally finds May, who has changed dramatically. He became one of the robbers, a violent and evil person; he is rich, but feels sick of his affluence. Martha talks him out of this way of life. May magically destroys his castle and feels that the spirit of Orlando has been reborn in him.

Unlike most leading French racehorses which are trained in and around Paris and owned by multi-millionaires, Saonois was trained in the French provinces, conditioned by a little-known trainer and owned by a local baker. The colt won three of his seven races on minor tracks as a two-year-old and won one of his two starts at Cagnes-sur-Mer in early 2012. When sent to compete at the major Parisian tracks he won the Prix La Force and finished fourth in the Prix Greffulhe before recording an upset win in the Prix du Jockey Club. Later that year he won the Prix Niel but ran poorly in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the Hong Kong Cup. He remained in training in 2013, but failed to recover his best form. Background Saonois is a bay horse with no white markings bred in France by Haras de Nonant-le-Pin. He was sired by Chichicastenango, who won four races including the Prix Lupin and the Grand Prix de Paris in 2001. As a breeding stallion the best of his progeny has been Vision d'Etat, whose wins included the Prix du Jockey Club and the Prince of Wales's Stakes. Saonois's dam Saonoise was a daughter of the Grand Prix de Paris winner Homme de Loi. The colt was sent into training with Jean-Pierre Gauvin at his small provincial stable at Saint-Cyr-les-Vignes in the country between St Etienne and Lyon in the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region of France. He was owned during his racing career by Pascal Treyve, a baker from Bellegarde-en-Forez who bought the horse for as part of a group of three costing ‚Ç¨13,000. Racing career =2011: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Saonois finished third in a race over 1200 metres at Lyon-Parilly racecourse on 10 June and then ran fourth in a similar event at Aix-les-Bains nineteen days later. After a break of more than three months he was moved up in distance and finished fifth over 1600 metres at Lyon-Parilly. Twelve days later he recorded his first success when racing over 1900 metres in a claiming race on the fibresand surface at Deauville Racecourse, winning by a length from Action Breaker and eight others at odds of 9/1. He returned to turf on 1 November and finished third behind Kadyny and Prince Solar in the Prix Aveu at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse. In his last two races of the season, the colt won races on very soft turf at Lyon-Parilly on 20 November and on fibresand at Deauville of 21 December. In these races he was ridden by Antoine Hameliin, who partnered him in all his subsequent races. =2012: three-year-old season= Saonois began his second season in February on the fibresand at Cagnes-sur-Mer on France's Mediterranean coast. After being beaten a short head by Sir Jade on his seasonal debut, he recorded a four lengths win against eight opponents in the Listed Prix Policeman over 2000 metres. After the race Gauvain said \\"He wasn't a natural from the start, but he has progressed with every run. It's great for his owner, who isn't one of the big guys, and has put absolute faith in me and my staff.\\" On 8 April Saonois was sent to race at a metropolitan track for the first time and was moved up in class for the Group Three Prix La Force over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Starting 7/2 second favourite in a six- runner field he raced in fourth place before moving forward in the straight. He struggled to obtain a clear run in the closing stages before breaking through in the final strides to win by a short head and a short neck from Saint Loup and the odds-on favourite Double Glory. Gauvain commented \\"I was a little worried because early on he was a little keen, but he showed on the sand at Cagnes he is a real competitor, and Antoine showed a very cool head\\". In the Group Two Prix Greffulhe over the same course and distance four weeks later he started 3.3/1 second favourite and finished fourth in a blanket finish behind Kesampour, Albion and Navel Orange. On 3 June, Saonois started a 25/1 outsider in a twenty-runner field for 175th running of the Prix du Jockey Club over 2100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse. His opponents were headed by French Fifteen (winner of the Crit√©rium International and runner-up to Camelot in the 2000 Guineas), and Imperial Monarch, the Aidan O'Brien-trained winner of the Sandown Classic Trial who started the 9/2 joint favourites. The other contenders included Saint Baudolino (Prix de Guiche), Kesampour, Most Improved, Ektihaam (runner-up in the Dante Stakes), Top Trip (Prix Hocquart), Hard Dream (Prix Noailles) and Sofast (Prix La Rochette). Hamelin held the colt at the rear of the field before beginning to make progress 800 metres from the finish. In the straight, Saonois moved up on the inside and accelerated through a narrow gap to take the lead inside the last 100 metres and won by three quarters of a length from Saint Baudolino. The 50/1 outsider Nutello was a head behind in third place just ahead of Kesampour. After a break of more than three months, Saonois returned to the racecourse for the Prix Niel (a trial race for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe) at Longchamp on 16 September. He started the joint-third-favourite in the betting alongside Kesampour, behind Last Train (narrowly beaten by Imperial Monarch in the Grand Prix de Paris) and the Secretariat Stakes winner Bayrir. The colt was restrained by Hamelin in the early stages and was still last of the six runners 400 metres from the finish. He struggled to obtain a clear run until the last 100 metres when he accelerated between horses to take the lead and won by one and a quarter lengths and a short head from Bayrir and Last Train. In October, Saonois started at odds of 9/1 for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe after his owner paid a supplementary entry fee of ‚Ç¨100,000. Racing on heavy ground, he never looked likely to win and finished fifteenth of the eighteen runners behind Solemia. On his final appearance of the season, Saonois was sent to Hong Kong to contest the Hong Kong Cup at Sha Tin Racecourse but made no impression, finishing tenth of the eleven runners behind California Memory. =2013: four-year-old season= Saonois remained in training as a four-year- old, but showed little worthwhile form in five races. In the first half of the season he finished fifth in the Prix Ganay, eighth in the Grand Prix de Chantilly and sixth in the Grand Prix de Vichy. When he returned in Autumn he was tried in lower class races but made no impact, finishing last of eleven in a race on the synthetic polytrack surface at Chantilly in October, and ninth in the Listed Grand Prix de Marseille in November. Stud record Saonois was retired from racing and began his career as a breeding stallion in 2014 at the Haras du Mesnil at a fee of ‚Ç¨3,000. His first foals were expected in 2015.

She produced the 50th anniversary of the Experiments in Art and Technology program with Nokia Bell Labs and the New Museum. Previously, she curated the inaugural digital art auctions at Phillips in New York, which were called an ‚Äúart breakthrough\\" in WIRED Magazine. Her exhibitions focus on social dynamics and aesthetics within online communities, as well as transparency, hacktivism, and collaborations between artists and technologists.  Education  Howard completed her bachelor's degree in Literature at Bennington College in Bennington, Vermont.  Research and Exhibitions  She started her career by founding the exhibition program at 319 Scholes, an organization and collective of artists, curators, writers, hackers, coders, and activists based in Brooklyn, New York. 319 Scholes focused on digital arts and interdisciplinary explorations of networked culture, especially the role of technology in everyday life, and promoted a ‚Äúnew era of openness and transparency in curatorial practice.‚Äù The exhibitions, workshops, and screenings at 319 Scholes contributed to the Net Art and Post-Internet Art movements. Howard's first exhibition was DUMP.FM IRL which showcased work created by users of DUMP.FM, an image-based chat room for real-time communication cofounded by artist Ryder Ripps. Of the exhibition, critic Paddy Johnson wrote: ‚ÄúThe collective picture formed was that of a unique community of makers, each using a lexicon of stock images, internet slang and animated gifs. This is the new art we've been waiting to see for the last 30 years.‚Äù Johnson named the exhibition one of the ‚Äú10 Best Exhibitions of 2010.‚Äù From 2012-2013, Howard was the Curatorial Fellow at Eyebeam Art & Technology Center. While at Eyebeam, Howard curated F.A.T. Gold: Five Years of Free Art & Technology, a retrospective of F.A.T. Lab, an organization that's ‚Äúpart artist collective, part hacktivist cell, and part Silicon Valley think tank.\\" The exhibition presented works from the collective's history as well as new commissions, such as Ideas Worth Spreading by Evan Roth and 3D printed artworks. F.A.T. Lab members, including Addie Wagenknecht, Chris Poole (moot), Geraldine Ju√°rez, Jamie Wilkinson, Jonah Peretti, Becky Stern, and Golan Levin, convened during the exhibition for talks, workshops, and to produce new works. As part of the opening, graffiti artist KATSU tagged Eyebeam's fa√ßade with a fire extinguisher, accidentally splashing some of the pigment on Paula Cooper Gallery which was ‚Äúa perfect example of F.A.T.‚Äôs IRL trolling practices.‚Äù During F.A.T. Gold: Five Years of Free Art & Technology, Howard and the artists took journalist Adrian Chen for a ride in a fake Google driverless car, which they whipped 180 degrees in front of the Google Headquarters in Manhattan. The exhibition led cyberpunk author Bruce Sterling to ask, \\"Why aren‚Äôt these violently compassionate art-hackers all in jail?\\" F.A.T. Gold: Five Years of Free Art & Technology subsequently toured to MU Eindhoven in the Netherlands and Gray Area Foundation for the Arts, where Howard curated a portrait of former Google Chairman Eric Schmidt made out of poop and the artists wheat-pasted memorial posters of Mark Zuckerberg around the Mission District. F.A.T. Lab went to San Francisco to \\"lament how technology has changed\\" and \\"celebrate the victory of government and commercial hegemony over the internet and the total loss of personal freedom and privacy\\"; the group disbanded following the exhibition at Gray Area. Howard curated Paddles ON! at Phillips, the inaugural digital art sales at a major international auction house. The auctions focused on artists who have pioneered innovative monetization models that reflect the democratic values of the internet generation. Paddles ON! featured the first art website to ever be auctioned: digital artist Rafa√´l Rozendaal's ifnoyes.com, which sold for $3,500 using the Art Website Sales Contract. Artist Petra Cortright used a view-based algorithm to price her video work, which resulted in her 24-second YouTube film selling for $3,200. Artist Molly Soda sold a YouTube webcam performance for $1,500. The New York Times wrote: ‚ÄúDigital art has become an accepted part of every biennial and international art fair, but the form is still the punk rock of the art world.\\" Howard established an online commissioning program where she worked with artists Shia Labeouf, Sougwen Chung, Eilis McDonald, Alexandra Gorczynski, Morehshin Allahyari, and Jacob Ciocci. In 2016, Howard released a body of research called Temporary Highs, which looks at how the structure of the internet enables reward-seeking behavior in a compulsive cycle of oversharing and consumption. Howard's writings examine the pleasure and anxiety of immediate gratification, as well as the constant search for validation, understanding, and connection. She presented Temporary Highs at SAIC, Oberlin College & Conservatory, and PNCA. In 2017, the New Museum invited Howard to produce the 50th anniversary of Experiments in Art and Technology program with Nokia Bell Labs. Howard worked with artists Sougwen Chung and Lisa Park as they collaborated with engineers to create large-scale art installations using Bell Labs' Motion Engine, which offers a way to visually analyze complex natural and manmade systems, as well as Bell Labs' advanced research into sensor technology.  Affiliations  Howard is a founding member of Deep Lab, a feminist collective of researchers examining how privacy, security, surveillance, anonymity and large-scale data aggregation are problematized in the arts, culture and society, along with Addie Wagenknecht, Kate Crawford, Claire L. Evans, Simone Browne, and Jillian York. She curated an exhibition of Deep Lab's work and a series of public programming at the New Museum in 2015. In 2016, Howard served on the selection committee for Creative Capital‚Äôs Emerging Fields award.

He was in charge of the service's Central Department for transport, mail and tele-communications (\\" / Section XIX\\"). Life Edgar Braun was born in Molbitz, some 30 km (18 miles) south of Jena, in Thuringia. His early years were marked by the war which broke out a few months after his birth, and involved the repeated destructive bombing of Molbitz which was adjacent to a Mineral Oil facility. His father worked as a dispatcher. In May 1945 the war ended and after the invading armies had rearranged themselves the whole of Thuringia became part of the Soviet occupation zone of what had been Germany. While Braun was at school, the occupation zone was transformed into a new separate German state, the German Democratic Republic, formally founded in October 1949. Directly after successful completion of his schooling, in 1957 he enrolled at the local office of the Ministry for State Security (MfS) in Altenburg. There followed a two year training at the MfS Academy on the edge of Potsdam. 1959, the year of his twentieth birthday, was the year in which Edgar Braun joined East Germany's ruling SED (party), and it was also when he joined \\"Section II\\" of the service (counter-intelligence) in the Stasi's Leipzig district. In 1961 he was transferred to Berlin, still as a member of the counter-intelligence section. In 1977 he was promoted, becoming deputy head of \\"Section I\\" (internal security). In this capacity he was charged with hunting down suspected and actual dissenters inside The Service. It was later reported that three of the dissidents he had identified during this period were executed, the best known of the three in the west being , a naval captain who is believed to have been working for western intelligence. Braun took a five year correspondence course with the Karl Marx Party Academy which led in 1980 to a degree in Social Sciences. The Ministry then, in 1982, promoted him to \\"Section XIX\\" (transport, mail and tele-communications), of which shortly afterwards he took on the leadership in succession to Helmut Griebner. In 1986 he was raised to the rank of Major general. November 1989 marked a terminal crisis for the East German regime, and it was the month in which Edgar Braun became a leading member of the National Security Office (AfNS / Amt f√ºr Nationale Sicherheit). This was a short-lived successor organisation to the Ministry for State Security (MfS). Braun's role within the AfNS is considered controversial by those who believe he used his position to try and force out the \\"Citizens' Committees\\" (\\"B√ºrgerkomitees\\") that had sprung up and were seeking to take over Stasi offices and preserve Stasi records that were likely to incriminate Stasi officers, Stasi collaborators and in some cases Stasi victims. There were also objections and that he tried, at the same time, to ensure amnesties for former Stasi officers and for their many secret collaborators as a quid pro quo for their silence. Following German reunification, which formally took place in October 1990, Edgar Braun worked as a real estate agent. However, he continued to defend the interests of those who had served as officers and associates of his former service. In 1992 he was one of several former senior Stasi officers who signed an open letter to the regional prime ministers of the New Federal States (former East Germany), in which the signatories condemned the ongoing \\"witch-hunt\\" against former Stasi collaborators and called for \\"silent solutions, behind closed doors\\" (\\"stille L√∂sungen unter Ausschluss der √ñffentlichkeit\\") in respect of disclosures of past Stasi activities. In 2003 he was one of those behind a two volume compilation entitled \\"Die Sicherheit, a justification of former Stasi- officers\\". Edgar Braun is a member of the Society for legal and humanitarian support, an organisation created in 1993 by former East German government ministers and officials, Stasi officers and border guards to counter threats of legal action following in the wake of the regime change of 1990. Braun continued to live in Berlin after his retirement.

Description  This type of climbing is used in the Alps, especially in the Bavarian range known as the Allg√§u Alps where the numerous grass mountains, which are not high, but very steep, make this mode of ascent necessary or possible (e.g. on the H√∂fats, Himmelhorn and Schneck).Wilfrid Noyce.

The level of protection possible when grass climbing is usually less than that for pure rock climbing. As a result, fatal falls are more common. Experienced grass climbers often use an ice tool.

Background He was the third but eldest surviving son of Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore, a landowner in County Louth with connections with many prominent Old English families of The Pale. Moore was a Protestant, unlike many of his relatives who remained Catholic. Moore had helped broker the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603, which brought an end to Tyrone's Rebellion. When Garret died in 1627, his Viscountcy and estates including Mellifont Abbey passed to his eldest son Charles. Charles's mother was Mary Colley, daughter of Sir Henry Colley of Castle Carbury: her brother, Henry Colley, Jr., was the direct ancestor of the Duke of Wellington. Charles married Alice Loftus, younger daughter of Adam Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus and Sarah Bathow Meredith, by whom he had at least four surviving children. Irish Rebellion Following the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion, Moore's house at Mellifont was captured on 21 November 1641 as a prelude to the rebels' Siege of Drogheda.Perceval-Maxwell p.222 Moore was one of the leaders of a relief force from Dublin that lifted the siege in March 1642. In 1643 Moore commanded troops from Dublin sent to resist an advance into Leinster by the Ulster Army of the Irish Confederates commanded by Owen Roe O'Neill. On 7 August Moore confronted O'Neill at the Battle of Portlester in County Meath. During the fighting he was killed by an artillery shot, said by some accounts to have been personally aimed and fired by his opponent O'Neill. Following Moore's death, the Protestant forces retreated with his body. O'Neill was unable to follow up his success by advancing towards Dublin.Casway p.87-88 His unusual death was the inspiration for a similar scene in the 1645 play, Cola's Furie by Henry Burkhead.Randall p.92 Moore was succeeded by his son, Henry who was made Earl of Drogheda by Charles II following the Restoration.
