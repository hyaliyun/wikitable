Career =Early career= His first experiences with computers occurred in 1978 while at school on the Isle of Wight, at the age of 15. In 1979 he began working at modifying the Lemonade and Breakout games that came with the system and, two years later, had finished his first full game, Liberator, for \\"the wonderfully titled Thorn EMI Video Programmes Ltd on his Apple II. From there, he became a freelance programmer, taking on \\"whatever work was available on the Apple II and the Mac.\\" This resulted in working on a shooter game called Crystal Raider which he notes came from \\"the observation of people messing around in applications such as MacPaint\\". =Crystal Quest= Soon after the game's release, Buckland decided to work on a follow up, Crystal Quest, which would take the gameplay of its predecessor, and add new features. The game ended up ported to numerous other platforms, including the Apple IIgs, Amiga, Nintendo Game Boy and Palm. =Stainless Software= In 1993, Along with Neil Barnden, Buckland started up Stainless Software \\"in order to concentrate on games\\". Among their first clients was Argonaut Games, who contracted the team to work on 3D engine development. Two years later, in 1995, the company landed their first games contract, with British publisher SCi, after pitching a title called \\"3D Destruction Derby\\" in 1994. Originally, the game was intended by the publisher to be a licensed Mad Max title, but SCi couldn't get their hands on the licence. Next, in anticipation of a sequel to the cult 1975 film Death Race 2000, the game was titled Death Race 2020. The film sequel fell through, and it was decided to just do it without the license. Carmageddon was released in mid 1997 ‚Äì using the BRender engine ‚Äì and immediately topped the UK games charts, with other charts worldwide following suit soon after. =VIS entertainment= In 1999 the company was absorbed into Scottish based developer VIS Entertainment. Most notable among the many projects that Buckland worked on as part of VIS was 2001's State of Emergency (video game), which saw him attached to the game midway through development as executive director and design consultant. In 2001 a rally project at VIS for Electronic Arts was cancelled, and VIS began restructuring itself. As part of this process, Patrick Buckland spun-off Stainless Games as an independent company again, which was financed by Les Edgar, founder of Bullfrog and ex- chairman of VIS. =Stainless Games= Since 2006 has seen the company release a number of titles, including a port of Crystal Quest, Scrabble 2007 edition, Red Baron, Happy Tree Friends: False Alarm, Warlords, Tempest, Battlezone, Asteroids, Missile Command, Centipede & Millipede, Novadrome, RISK: Factions and most notable Magic: The Gathering ‚Äì Duels of the Planeswalkers. He was wholly or partly responsible for the production of videogames such as Crystal Quest, Carmageddon, Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now, Carmageddon: Reincarnation and Magic: The Gathering ‚Äì Duels of the Planeswalkers. He also produced a range of non-game software over the years, including AME, a security system used by (amongst others) the CIA and NASA, Crash Barrier, a crash recovery utility for the Macintosh, a Teletext authoring system, CAD software for the marine industry, retail packaging CAD systems, LeLisp for the French government, Structured BASIC or the Apple // and various other software packages.

The battle marked the start of one of the bloodiest wars in Post-Soviet Georgia. Background In July 1992, Georgian officials were taken hostage by Pro-Gamsukhurdia (separatists) forces known as Zviadists in Mingrelia and later in the Gali Region. Several more were taken when Georgian officials attempted to negotiate with them. In response, Georgian police created assault units to help free the hostages. The Abkhaz Interior Ministry said that Georgian and Abkhaz Units would cooperate to help free the hostages. In August, a National Guard unit was deployed in Gali to help release the hostages and the hostages were freed by August 19 without full- scale combat. Entering Sukhumi However, the 1,000 man strong assault unit created by the police did not stop at Gali. They then launched an attack on the capital, Sukhumi to retake the city for Georgia. They took the city's airport, which was 25 kilometers from the city. A news blockade was imposed on journalists, and by noon they were forcibly entering Sukhumi. Georgian Tanks and APC's moved through the streets, battling Abkhaz militias who were armed with machine guns and formed barricades in the streets, while hurling Molotov cocktails as they lacked heavy anti-tank weapons. Georgian units used artillery against Abkhaz separatists in the places they controlled within the city. Despite Abkhaz resistance, the Georgian units were heavily armed and took the city within a matter of days. On 18 August, the Parliament of Abkhazia was stormed by the Georgian National Guard, and the Georgian flag was raised on the Council of Ministers buildings. All of Sukhumi was taken by August 18. Casualties and aftermath 19 people were killed and 39 severely injured. Georgian units were accused of looting, assault, murder and other ethnically based war crimes. Abkhaz separatists retreated to Guduata, and started to arm themselves for a counterattack.

Located in Burbank, California, Kino Flo is best known for developing proprietary LEDs based on a color science technology that ensures color quality unsurpassed for lighting both close-ups and on large studio spaces. In 1995 Kino Flo earned a technical achievement award from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences for developing cool, tube-based arrays with color-correct tungsten and daylight balanced light that \\"changed the way motion picture movies are made,\\" according to the academy. The company's tradition of supplying cinematographers with advanced lighting tools to shape their images continues with an expanding line of LED luminaires, from small hand held panels to large interconnecting arrays, that includes camera loo-up profiles (LUTs) for harmonizing Kino Flos with cinema cameras and a suite of upgradable color space controls. Uses Soft light use is popular in cinematography and film. Various Hollywood production companies along with independent film makers are known for their use of soft lights. History According to director Wim Wenders, as discussed on the Criterion Collection edition of his 1977 gangster film, The American Friend, Robby M√ºller first assembled and utilized a primitive Kino Flo unit in 1976, during the shooting of the film. The Kino Flo unit was legitimized in 1987, during the filming of the movie Barfly. Director of photography Robby M√ºller was filming in a cramped interior, and couldn't fit traditional lights into the location. In order to work around the problem, the film's gaffer Frieder Hochheim and best boy Gary Swink designed a high-output fluorescent light that had a remote ballast, allowing the lamp unit to become small and lightweight enough to be taped to the wall.Brown, Blain. Cinematography: Theory and Practice, p. 151. Focal Press, 2002. Hochheim and Swink subsequently created a company, Kino Flo Incorporated, to manufacture and market their innovation to the film industry. The new lights were quickly embraced by cinematographers, and now are considered a staple of a standard motion picture lighting package.Salt, Barry. Film Style and Technology: History and Analysis, 2nd edition, p. 287. Starword, 1992. Technology The two major innovations of the unit were the high-frequency ballast, which gave the lights greater intensity and eliminated flicker commonly found in off-the-shelf fluorescent tubes, and the Kino Flo tubes, which contained a number of special phosphors designed to eliminate the characteristic tints in the magenta-green spectrum which are present in most domestic fluorescent lights.Salt, Barry. Moving Into Pictures, \\"Film Style and Technology in the Nineties\\", p. 303. Starword, 2006. Since the type of tube determines the color temperature, any Kino Flo lamphead can be quickly converted between daylight and tungsten balances by simply changing out the tubes. Mid-range color temperature can also be created by mixing tubes of both color temperatures. Kino Flo have also expanded their tube line in recent years, creating visual effects tubes optimized for bluescreen and greenscreen spectra, as well as a variety of other shades for general color effects.Kino Flo lamps References External links * Category:Film and video technology Category:Lighting brands Category:Stage lighting instruments Category:Entertainment companies based in California Category:Manufacturing companies based in Los Angeles Category:American companies established in 1987 Category:Entertainment companies established in 1987 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1987 Category:1987 establishments in California Category:Products introduced in 1987 ","title":"Kino Flo"},{"id":"42765615","text":"is a 2014 Japanese supernatural horror film directed by Takashi Miike.

Cyber-nationalism has different aspects, which may help the government as a part of the propaganda. As a social phenomena, cyber-nationalism is nationalistic groups who are gathering on the internet. They often perform offensive actions against other countries, such as hacking and trying to affect elections. This phenomenon can be found in several countries such as Japan, Russian Federation, and China.  Background  The Internet makes it easy to communicate without physical borders. Through digitization, people who are living in different counties, can communicate better than before. It is theorized that physical borders, which once prevented homophilous actors from congregating, are absent on the internet, allowing people of like mind to meet and politically or socially mobilize, whereas pre-internet they were unable to.Palmer, M. F. (2012). Cybernationalism: Terrorism, Political Activism, and National Identity Creation in Virtual Communities and Social Media. In Virtual Communities, Social Networks and Collaboration (pp. 115-134). Springer New York. Others, however, have argued that this idea is idealistic. Users on the internet tend to harbor a strong dislike towards each other, unlike the expectation.  Cyber-war  Cyber-nationalism is part of the governmental policy. Governments use the internet as a part of propaganda to mobilize people. The Internet has certain advantage to encourage and improve nationalism. It catches more awareness than traditional media such as Newspapers and Television. Moreover, Internet makes it easier to organize activities.  By country  =China= In China, cyber-nationalism is very active. Chinese nationalists use the Internet resources available to them (considering that the Internet is restricted in China by censorship and the Great Firewall) to organize online and recruit further supporters. The isolationist view and xenophobic tendency are also consistently ridiculed in this aspect of Chinese cyber nationalism. Other Chinese nationalists use the Internet to hack, spam, and otherwise influence the technological infrastructure of nations the nationalists consider anti-China, primarily members of the European Union, the United States and Japan. Many Western observers, as well as Chinese dissidents, believe that cyber-nationalist and hacking efforts are aided or organized by the Chinese government. However, there are individuals and organizations who voluntarily carry out their own cyber initiatives to defend their country. In 2016, Little Pink, an organization composed of young digital nationalists, attacked the social media account of Chou Tzu-yu after the Taiwanese pop singer waved Taiwan's flag on a television show. A number of the cyber nationalist activities are said to be reactive or event-driven and forced by actors or instances when China's national interests are damaged. For instance, there is an increase in anti-American cyber nationalistic movement every time the U.S. elevated its threat level against China. These movements often include cyber attacks such as the case of the China Eagle Club, a hacker organization that carried out the so-called Taiwan Blitz designed to combat Chen Shui-bian's ascent to power. =Japan= In Japan, recently cyber- nationalists (netto-uyoku) have become very active. They communicate with each other on the internet. In 2009, some part of the cyber-nationalist took actions against Korean tourists in the Tsushima Island, which is located near South Korea. Footage of this can be found on YouTube. According to Rumi Sakamoto, \\"This episode is just one expression of Japan‚Äôs new grassroots nationalism, which has gained force over the last decade against the backdrop of increasingly vociferous historical revisionism and neo-nationalism.\\" In the past these kind of actions would not have raised public awareness, but the internet makes it easy for these groups to get public attention. =Russia= In Russia, nationalist groups use the Internet to solicit donations, recruit and organize. After the Russo-Georgian war, groups on Facebook such as \\"Abkhazia is not Georgia\\" and other Internet communities formed. Since many ethnic Russians were worried about terrorism from the Caucasus region, Russian nationalists doxxed students who are studying in Caucasian universities. They also proliferated propaganda videos in which dark-skinned young people are beating up ethnic Russians. At the same time, anti-Russian government activist groups are recruiting on the Internet. In this case, cyber-nationalism aids in building support for the Chechen Republic and ethnic Chechen people against the Russian state, along with other minority groups that feel marginalized by the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin.

Early life In 1913, Yun Daiying entered the private Zhonghua University in Wuchang, and after graduation in 1918, he stayed there as an instructor. In 1919, he participated in the May Fourth Movement in Wuhan. In 1920, he founded the Socialist Youth League of China with Xiao Chun√º and others, and in 1921, he joined the Communist Party of China as one of the first batch of party members. In 1923, he became an instructor at Shanghai University. In Shanghai, he became a leader of the Communist Youth League of China and the chief editor of the periodical China Youth from 1925-1927. Political career In 1924, he joined under orders the Kuomintang (First United Front), promoting cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. In 1925, he led the May Thirtieth Movement in Shanghai. He went to the Whampoa Military Academy in Canton in 1926, where he became a military instructor in the political department, aiding the work of Zhou Enlai. In the Northern Expedition of July, he stayed in Canton. In September after the North Expedition forces liberated Wuhan, he went to Wuhan to become the chief military instructor of the Republic of China Military Academy. After Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei launched a purge against the communists in succession in April and July 1927, he was sent to Jiujiang, where he helped organize the Nanchang Uprising. In the end of 1927, he led the Guangzhou Uprising and was appointed secretary-general of the Canton Soviet Government. After its failure, he fled first to Hong Kong and later to Shanghai. In the end of 1928, he started to direct propaganda work of the communist party, creating the periodical Red Flag. In June 1929, he was elected as a central committee member in the 2nd Plenary Session of 6th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Due to his opposition to leftist mistakes within the party, he was demoted and appointed communist party council secretary of Shanghai Ludong District. Execution On May 6, 1930, he was captured and detained in Shanghai, and later in February 1931, he was detained in Nanjing. Initially, he did not reveal his identity. Right before he was to be rescued out of prison, he was identified and betrayed by Gu Shunzhang. After Chiang Kai-shek's men failed to entice or force surrender, Chiang ordered his execution on April 29. Before his death, Yun Daiying wrote in prison a poem of martyrdom: > Having roamed far and wide, I recollect old comrades, Old comrades are > immortal regardless of life or death, I've dismissed personal loss, seeing > it as negligible, Preserving my heroic bent albeit serving as prisoner.  Statue  His statue was erected at Central China Normal University.

It was screened as part of the International Critics' Week section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. The film received seven nominations at the 40th C√©sar Awards, winning Best Supporting Actor for Reda Kateb.  Plot  Benjamin Barois (Vincent Lacoste) starts his medical internship in the service lead by his father, Dr. Barois (Jacques Gamblin). Feeling enthuastic, at first, he meets Abdel Rezzak (Reda Kateb), another fellow intern who's from Algeria. However, he is soon caught up by the harsh reality of the hospital work. Indeed, during a night shift, Benjamin visits Jean- Michel Lemoine, a homeless patient who suffers from abdominal pains. Benjamin tries his best to reassure him and prescribes him analgesics but, because of the misfunctions of the device, he cannot do an ECG. The morning after, a colleague tells him that Mr Lemoine is dead. Benjamin is, then, summoned by his superior, Dr. Denormandy (Marianne Denicourt) to review with her about what happened yesterday. Benjamin confesses he couldn't do the ECG. Dr. Denormandy tells him that, if someone were to ask him about the matter, he must reply that he actually did the ECG and didn't notice anything abnormal. This case put a strain on Benjamin's relationship with Abdel, as Benjamin told Mr Lemoine's widow that it was actually Abdel who took care of her husband, not him. Meanwhile, Benjamin and Abdel are also taking care of another patient, Mrs Richard (Jeanne Cellard), an 80-year-old woman, who used to be a gymnast, and now, suffers from a metastatic cancer and had to go recently through a femur neck surgery. While they are discussing about the appropriate treatment to deliver as well as the level of pain Mrs Richard feels, Abdel decides to install a morphine pump so that she won't suffer anymore. However, it appears that the patient doesn't eat much, which could put her life at risk. Abdel disagrees with Dr. Denormandy concerning the procedure to be followed and accepts reluctanctantly the removal of the morphine pump. During another night shift of Benjamin, the latter is called after Mrs Richard has lost consciousness. As he enters the room, he sees his colleagues trying to resuscitate the patient, which provokes his anger. When Mrs Richard's family, who has been informed by a nurse, arrives, Abdel and Benjamin discuss with them about the possibility to put an end to the life of the patient, in accordance with the Leonetti law. The family accepts, as there is no point in persisting any further and making Mrs Richard suffer. However, Abdel and Benjamin were not supposed to take this decision by themselves, in the middle of the night. Consequently, they are summoned for a disciplinary hearing, attended by Dr. Denormandy, Dr. Barois and the critical care team leader. After discussion, it was decided that Benjamin won't be punished due to his age as well as his emotional state during the events. However, a misconduct statement will be added to Abdel's file, much to the latter's dismay. Indeed, it could probably prevent him from doing other internships, putting an end to his goal of obtaining a certificate of equivalence for his Algerian qualification and so, being allowed to practice as a doctor in France. Benjamin, who, meanwhile, has ended up befriending Abdel, is distraught by this decision, claiming that everything is his fault. One night, after getting drunk, he goes to Mrs Lemoine's place and confesses that they haven't conducted all the necessary examinations that could have prevented the death of her late husband. He then goes to the hospital and starts wrecking the equipments and disturbing the patients before running away from the nurses and security guards. However, after leaving the hospital, he ends up getting hit by a truck. The morning after, after gathering the interns, Dr. Barois and the hospital director inform them that Benjamin has woken up and that Mrs Lemoine is suing the hospital for medical malpractice. Appalled by the news, the medical staff blames the director, claiming that these kinds of errors happen because they are understaffed and that they only have defective equipments. For the very same reasons, they demand the withdrawal of Abdel's sanction, which they obtain. Eventually, Benjamin recovers from his injuries and is happy to learn that Abdel will be able to continue practising. He personally changes service and joins the neurology one, gaining back the enthusiastic attitude he had when he started his internship.

R. Martin, and its television adaptation, Game of Thrones. Olenna is first mentioned in A Game of Thrones (1996) and appears in A Storm of Swords (2000) and A Feast for Crows (2005). She is the matriarch of the powerful House Tyrell, the largest and second wealthiest of the eight Great Houses of Westeros. Olenna is characterized by her cunning, ambition, and sharp wit (the latter of which being the foundation for her title, the Queen of Thorns, alongside the Tyrell sigil of a rose). Although her family is allied with the Lannisters in King's Landing, she often finds her own machinations at odds with theirs, especially those of Tywin Lannister. She, along with Petyr Baelish, is responsible for the death of King Joffrey Baratheon during his wedding to her granddaughter and prot√©g√©, Margaery. Olenna was portrayed by veteran English actress Diana Rigg in the HBO television adaptation, who received significant critical praise for her portrayal. Rigg received Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her performances in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2018. Character profile Olenna Tyrell, also known as the Queen of Thorns, is a former Redwyne and the mother of Mace Tyrell. She is described as a wizened and cunning old woman with a wicked wit and a sharp tongue, and is known for openly stating her opinion. Olenna is not a point of view character in the novels, so her actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as Sansa Stark and Cersei Lannister. Olenna is mostly a background character in the novels. Storylines Coat of arms of House Tyrell In A Storm of Swords, she plots to have Sansa taken to Highgarden to marry her grandson Willas. This plan is foiled by the Lannisters, who force Sansa to marry Tyrion Lannister. According to Littlefinger later in A Storm of Swords, in order to shield Margaery from King Joffrey's cruelty, Olenna had actually been the one who murdered Joffrey at his wedding. Margaery would later go on to marry the younger brother, Tommen Baratheon. TV adaptation Lady Olenna, better known as \\"The Queen of Thorns\\", is the sharp-witted grandmother of Loras and Margaery. In the adaptation, Olenna is the matriarch of, and the true power behind, House Tyrell. She is also aware of and is generally unconcerned with her grandson Loras's homosexuality. Olenna implies that both closet matriarchy and tolerance of \\"sword-swallowers\\" are considered relatively normal in the Reach. She is notably one of the few characters that Tywin Lannister treats as an equal. Olenna was played by the British actress Diana Rigg in the television adaption of the series of books. Commenting on the casting of Diana Rigg, David Benioff said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt audition Dames, they audition you‚Äù. Rigg highly praised the show after being cast as Olenna, saying that she \\"couldn‚Äôt ask for better lines ‚Äì I‚Äôm so lucky. I could be sitting at home crumbling but I'm not.\\" Speaking on the character, Rigg said that Olenna \\"says all the things that other people dare not say\\". Remarking on the series and the character: > I wasn't aware I was getting involved in something so huge. I really had no > idea. She is also pretty evil; I'm good at evil. Remarking on the costumes of the series: > Also the costume is terrific. I don‚Äôt have to spend hours in make-up and I‚Äôm > in a wimple, it‚Äôs great. I adore it, I absolutely adore it. Executive producer D. B. Weiss said of Rigg's final scene as Olenna, \\"What I love about the way she plays the scene is that even though you leave the scene knowing she‚Äôs soon going to be dead shortly after you cut to black you still feel like she won. She‚Äôs probably the only character to win her own death scene.\\" = Season 3 = After learning the abuses Sansa Stark suffered by Joffrey, Olenna figured out that Margaery could avoid the same fate by using Joffrey's love of violence. Varys warns Olenna that Petyr Baelish has designs on Sansa, who, given the death or disappearance of all her brothers, is now the key to the North. Olenna thus secretly plots to have Sansa marry Loras. Her plan is foiled by Loras himself, who accidentally reveals it to his new lover, one of Baelish's spies. Baelish informs Tywin Lannister, who has Sansa marry his son Tyrion Lannister instead. To secure the Reach, Tywin orders his daughter Cersei to marry Loras. Lady Olenna is at first against this because Cersei is too old (and therefore unlikely to have more children) and because of the scandal of her incestuous affair with her twin brother Jaime. But after Tywin threatens to make Loras join the celibate Kingsguard, which would make Joffrey and Margaery's children the heirs of Reach, Olenna admits defeat and praises Tywin for getting the best of her. = Season 4 = Olenna conspires with Petyr Baelish to murder Joffrey, so as to protect Margaery from Joffrey's beastly nature ‚Äì it is Olenna who actually does the deed, using a poison Petyr arranged to have smuggled into the wedding on Sansa's person. Quietly admitting her actions, Olenna advises Margaery to become acquainted with her new match, Tommen Baratheon, Joffrey's younger brother and heir, before Cersei turns him against her. Olenna returns to Highgarden shortly afterwards. = Season 5 = When Loras is arrested by the recently reinstated Faith Militant for his homosexuality, Margaery writes to her grandmother who returns to the capital in order to protect her grandchildren from Cersei's schemes. But, mistakenly believing Loras's arrest was simply meant to humiliate House Tyrell, she helplessly assists to Olyvar's testimony which incriminates her grandson, as well as to Margaery's incarceration for perjuring herself in front of the gods in an effort to protect her brother. She later confronts the High Sparrow without results and has a secret meeting with Littlefinger who, blackmailed by Olenna for his part in Joffrey's death and in order to placate his role in her grandchildren's imprisonment in providing Olyvar to Cersei, gives valuable information about Lancel and Cersei's adulterous relationship. This results in the latter's arrest by the Faith Militant. = Season 6 = Olenna takes steps to free Margaery from the High Sparrow and retake power from the Faith Militant, but the plan is thwarted when Tommen forges an alliance with the Faith and becomes the High Sparrow's new puppet. Margaery feigns loyalty and manages to instruct Olenna to leave the city when the High Sparrow threatens her life. Cersei's plotting ultimately causes the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, killing Margaery, Loras, Mace, and the High Sparrow. A grieving Olenna is invited to Dorne to meet with Ellaria Sand, who has seized control of the region and declared open rebellion against the Lannisters. In Dorne, Ellaria presents Varys, who persuades Olenna to support Daenerys Targaryen, having been a secret Targaryen loyalist all along. Olenna sends the Tyrell fleet to Meereen to assist in taking Daenerys' forces to Westeros. = Season 7 = During a meeting with Daenerys' allies at Dragonstone, Olenna displays her initial unease about Tyrion Lannister's plan to attack King's Landing using the Tyrell and Dornish forces, but eventually agrees. After the meeting, Daenerys asks Olenna to stay to talk with her. Daenerys acknowledges that Olenna has joined forces with her to exact revenge for her family, and not out of any loyalty to her. Olenna advises Daenerys not to listen to \\"wise men\\" such as Tyrion, as that is how she has stayed alive all these years: ignoring them. She then tells her the lords of Westeros are all sheep, and Daenerys is a dragon, so she should *be* a dragon. In \\"The Queen's Justice\\", Jaime Lannister seizes control of Highgarden on Cersei's orders. He confronts Olenna, granting her a painless death by poison, putting it in her cup of wine as she watches. She drinks the entire cup all at once with no hesitation, and then admits her responsibility for Joffrey's death, wanting Cersei to know who had done it. = Recognition and awards = Diana Rigg received positive reviews for her role as Olenna Tyrell in the TV series. Screen Rant called Rigg's performance full of energy and fun, saying that the character is \\"refreshing\\" and has \\"sassy put-downs and blunt talk, she is likely the closest thing to comic relief we have in the show.\\" She received several award nominations for her portrayal of Olenna Tyrell. For her performance in the series, Primetime Emmy Awards nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2018, and Critics' Choice Television Award nominations for Best Guest Performer in a Drama Series in 2013 and 2014.

After much pleading, his father (a veterinarian) finally agreed to let him attend evening classes in drawing at the municipal academy in Mechelen. His success there led to evening classes at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp) while he worked in the studios of a decorative artist named Henri Verbuecken during the day. During his military duty in 1884, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was exempted from any further service. He began taking day classes at the Academy, spending his evenings working and studying with Charles Verlat, where he first made contact with Frans Hens, Alexander Struys and other members of De XIII. Despite his illness (and with the help of his friends), he managed to exhibit widely throughout Northern and Central Europe and began to attract positive critical attention. The first meeting of the Belgian artists' group Kunst van Heden (The Art of Today) in 1901 was essentially a tribute to his work. He was an early advocate of plein air painting and was influenced by the bright color scheme of impressionism, but usually chose subjects that were more naturalistic in character. When he became too ill to work he entered a sanitarium, but stayed for only a short time, preferring to die in his home town of Kapelle-op-den-Bos.

Cooper White Jr. (March 8, 1927 ‚Äì April 22, 2017), was the 28th mayor of Greenville, South Carolina, a position which he held from 1969 to 1971. He was the District 4 representative on the six- member Greenville City Council from 1963 until his election as mayor. White has been the chairman of the board of the Greenville Retirement Center. Background White went to the Greenville public schools. He went to Furman University and was a stockbroker. White died at McCall Hospice House in Greenville, South Carolina.R. Cooper White-obituary White's role in 1970 gubernatorial campaign During his tenure as mayor, White was a Moderate Republican whereas most South Carolina party members and officials at that time were conservatives who had supported Barry Goldwater and Richard M. Nixon for U.S. President in 1964 and 1968. In 1970, White endorsed the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, John C. West, the outgoing lieutenant governor, rather than Republican Albert Watson, the U.S. representative from South Carolina's 2nd congressional district who carried the backing of U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond in a determined bid to become the first GOP governor of the state since Reconstruction.Billy Hathorn, \\"The Changing Politics of Race: Congressman Albert William Watson and the South Carolina Republican Party, 1965‚Äì1970\\", South Carolina Historical Magazine Vol. 89 (October 1988), pp. 231‚Äì233, 235‚Äì236, 238 Watson fielded television advertisements featuring scenes from riots five years earlier in the Watts section of Los Angeles. The spots were so controversial that White cited them in his refusal to endorse Watson.Watson was only the second Republican in the 20th century to run for governor of South Carolina, the first having been Joseph O. Rogers Jr., in 1966. White's criticism alarmed Republicans who feared that Watson had painted himself into a minority position considering the decline in support for segregation. The Florence Morning News accused Watson of waging a \\"negative campaign\\" focusing upon \\"those who stand for racial segregation above all else.\\" The Morning News declared the racial issue invalid because a governor could not \\"turn back the clock ... and is powerless to defy the federal courts.\\" Echoing White's view, the Rev. Dr. Angus McKay Brabham, a proclaimed Republican who edited the South Carolina Methodist Advocate, endorsed West because various members of the John Birch Society and the Ku Klux Klan were supporting Watson, who lost the election to West, 52.1 to 45.9 percent. Another relatively moderate Republican, Arthur Ravenel Jr., of Charleston, a former Democrat, had planned to oppose Watson in a Republican primary, but the selection was made by state convention. Years later, Ravenel became a state senator and U.S. representative from South Carolina's 1st congressional district. Ravenel said that the failure to hold a primary hurt the Watson campaign because it mistakenly assumed moderate Republican support, such as that of Mayor White, which could have made the difference between success and defeat.

He joined the Capel Street Theatre in Dublin in 1782, and the Crow Street Theatre later during the 1782‚Äì3 season. The next season, he was brought to the Mill Gate Theatre, by Michael Atkins. He was in 1785 a member of the company at Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin. On the introduction of Charles Macklin, Macready went to Liverpool, and to Manchester under George Mattocks at the beginning of 1786. The London stage Macready appeared at Covent Garden Theatre, 18 September 1786, as Flutter in the Belle's Stratagem, and remained there ten years, playing parts such as Gratiano, Paris, Young Marlow, Figaro, Fag, and Tattle in Love for Love, and producing two plays by himself. He returned to Dublin to take summer parts, to the early 1790s. At Covent Garden Macready took only supporting roles, to 1797: he was one of the proverbial \\"second-rate walking gentlemen\\". Then he sought to become an actor-manager outside London, with mixed success. He began in management at Birmingham, around 1795‚Äì6; in 1796 George Davies Harley was denying a rift there with Macready. Provincial actor-manager Macready managed a variety season in 1797, unsuccessfully, the Royalty Theatre, Wellclose Square, then east of London; his company was drawn from other theatres. The programme was directed towards burlettas and pantomimes. Macready is best known as manager of the theatres at Birmingham, Sheffield, and other provincial towns and cities; but his ambitions were not fulfilled. In 1806 he took over at Newcastle from Stephen George Kemble, holding the lease to 1818. Macready also attempted but failed in management in Manchester. He was jailed for debt in Lancaster Castle in 1809. At that time he owed money on the Newcastle lease, and was trying to manage a group of theatres in locations also including Birmingham, Derby, Nottingham and Sheffield. In 1813 Macready built the first theatre in Carlisle in Blackfriars Street. At the time of his second marriage, in 1821, he was described as manager of a theatre in Whitehaven. Last years at Bristol Macready took on the lease of the Theatre Royal, Bristol in 1819, from John Boles Watson II, son of John Boles Watson who had built up a southern and Welsh circuit of 40 provincial theatres. He initially brought in Daniel Terry and Elizabeth Yates to launch the new management, with the help of his son.G. Rennie Powell, The Bristol Stage: its story (1919), pp. 34‚Äì6; archive.org. Macready died at Bristol 11 April 1829, aged 74. He left interests in the Theatre Royal, Bristol, and theatres in Cardiff and Swansea. Works John Henry Johnstone as Murdock Delany in The Irishman in London, 1797 engraving Macready was responsible for two adapted dramas. The Irishman in London; or, the Happy African, 1793 and 1799, performed 21 April 1792, was an adaptation of a farce called The Intriguing Footman, attributed to James Whiteley, manager at Nottingham. This work became popular on both sides of the Atlantic, being performed at the John Street Theatre in New York on 5 June 1793. Its use of blackface acting is considered an influence into the 19th century; it featured a contrast of the stage Irish and African servant. The censor John Larpent applied the blue pencil to some of the language of the play directed at a black female character, Cubba. The Bank-note, or a Lesson for Ladies, 1795, performed 1 May 1795, was an adaptation of William Taverner's Artful Husband. The Village Lawyer, a farce, 1795, Haymarket, 28 August 1787, is ascribed to Macready, but probably in error, in a pirated edition. It is an adaptation of L'Avocat Pathelin by David-Augustin de Brueys; there is reason to believe that George Colman the Elder translated it. It has also been attributed to Charles Lyons, an Irish schoolmaster. Family Macready married, 18 June 1786 in Manchester, Christina Ann Birch, an actress, the daughter of a surgeon in Lincolnshire. Mrs. Macready, who played secondary parts, died in Birmingham 3 December 1803, aged 38. William Macready was their son. He was the fifth of eight children of the marriage. Another of Macready's sons, Major Edward Nevil Macready, commanded the Light Company of the 30th Regiment of Foot in the closing stages of the Battle of Waterloo.

It was released on 4 July 2014, and is based on the novel by Akio Fukamachi. Plot Akikazu Fujishima (K≈çji Yakusho) is a former detective who lost his job, marriage and daughter after having a violent reaction to his wife's infidelity. Since then, he has become a dysfunctional, unstable alcoholic. Many years later, his ex-wife (Asuka Kurosawa) contacts him to tell him that his daughter Kanako (Nana Komatsu) has gone missing. Akikazu begins investigating the disappearance, with police detective Asai (Satoshi Tsumabuki) ostensibly helping but in truth rarely involving himself in the search. Akikazu's methods involve harassing and intimidating those he speaks to, including Kanako's former classmates and teacher (Miki Nakatani), but none of them are forthcoming. Nonetheless, he discovers that she had become involved with drug users, and suspects that they made her into an addict. Flashbacks to three years prior reveal how an unnamed student (Hiroya Shimizu) in Kanako's middle school had fallen in love with her, as she was the only kid who didn't bully or ostracize him. The student knowing Kanako had been in love with a former student named Ogata, wanted her to feel the same way for him. This desire eventually leads him to attend a party with her, where he is drugged and raped. The student then tracks down Kanako and contemplates killing her, but is unable to. She embraces him, before an unidentified figure stabs the student in the neck, killing him. In the present, Akikazu is eventually captured by the Yakuza, who torture and kill Kanako's gang member friend Matsunaga (Mahiro Takasugi) in front of him. Matsunaga informs Akikazu as to how Ogata was a \\"weak boy with a cute face\\" so they kidnapped him and allowed old men to rape him, which caused him to commit suicide. Kanako having been in love with Ogata befriended the group in order to exact revenge. Due to Ogata's death or perhaps exacerbated by it Kanako is completely emotionless which easily allows her to become involved with the child prostitution ring, and manipulate other kids (along with the unnamed student) to use drugs and drink, thus allowing older men to rape them. Even knowing about Kanakos intentions and lack of feelings for anyone or anything, Matsunaga had fallen in love with Kanako and helped her to steal the photos. The Yakuza inform Akikazu that the police are also involved in the prostitution ring and that Detective Aikawa (Joe Odagiri) had killed several of Kanako's criminal friends in an attempt at a cover-up. They provide Akikazu with a gun and send him to Aikawa's home. Akikazu rapes Aikawa's wife, then takes her and her son hostage to meet Aikawa. The two have a bloody fight, during which Aikawa kills his wife, but both men survive. The police, including Detective Asai, arrive on the scene, and kill Aikawa. Akikazu hits Asai with his car and escapes. Akikazu returns to the teacher that he questioned much earlier, having realized that her daughter was one of the children being raped in Kanako's photos, and that she had killed Kanako in revenge. He forces her to dig up the grave that she buried Kanako in, but its location has been lost due to recent snowfall. While the teacher insists that his search for his daughter's body is futile and tries to escape, Akikazu continues to dig, refusing to acknowledge that his daughter is dead. The film ends as he vows to kill her himself.

A stereoscopic video game (also S-3D video game) is a video game which uses stereoscopic technologies to create depth perception for the player by any form of stereo display. Such games should not to be confused with video games that use 3D game graphics on a mono screen, which give the illusion of depth only by monocular cues but not by binocular depth information. Description Stereoscopic video games have been available for several years for PCs through the Nvidia 3D Vision and other platforms including AMD HD3D, DDD TriDef that use compatible hardware and active shutter 3D glasses. For video game consoles, however, stereoscopic 3D support must be specifically built into each game. Potential stereoscopic game support is available, for instance, on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Wii U and PlayStation 4. Nintendo 3DS is fully designed for autostereoscopic games. Although no longer considered a key feature for successful game development by as many as during the stereoscopic 3D hype in 2010, stereoscopic support for video games is still considered a minor enhancement to video games. One of the reasons for the technology's lack of success was that the surprise effect quickly wears off. A HTC Vive that is designed for virtual reality gaming with stereo 3D graphics. A study at the University of Derby showed that converted 2D games do not transfer very well to stereoscopic 3D and concluded: \\"... games targeted to stereoscopic 3D audiences and devices must be designed from the start with stereoscopic 3D in mind.\\" Therefore, stereo video games must have elements that can only be achieved in S-3D for a proper stereoscopic immersion. For example, in the game Super Stardust HD, asteroids stand out from the plane. It makes navigation easier and serves a fundamental purpose. Super Mario 3D Land is another example for easier navigation and furthermore the game plays with depth, e.g. with Escher-style perspective puzzles. Developers also need to mind perceptual problems such as stereo window violations and occlusion of virtual objects. Another scientific paper showed that S3D vision can measurably change player behavior depending on actual game design. Recent developments of consumer virtual reality headsets such as for example Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR, Fove, and Open Source Virtual Reality also include stereoscopic support as one of their features. The entire development trend of games and other software for such head-mounted displays remains to be seen. Rendering techniques There are two primary rendering techniques employed in stereoscopic video games: 2D + depth rendering, and dual rendered 3D. =2D + depth rendering= This technique generates a second point of view from a single rendered image. It has an upper limit on how much parallax can be created. 2D+ can be compared to 2D to 3D conversion techniques for 3D films. Several video games for Xbox 360 and PS3 used this method. =Dual rendering= This technique renders two images. It creates the best stereoscopic effect but has double system requirements for graphic rendering and higher production demands. History =1980s= Famicom 3D System, released in 1987 for Japan only Sega released the world's first commercial stereoscopic video game, SubRoc-3D, in 1982. This arcade game introduced an active shutter 3D system, jointly developed by Sega with Matsushita (now Panasonic). In 1983, the first model of the TomyTronic series of gaming laptop LCD game & watch-type stereoscopic 3D was released by Takara Tomy. A 3D imager for the console Vectrex vector, a pair of 3D glasses using a rotating color wheel synchronized with the display was released by Smith Engineering in 1984. In 1987, the shutter-based SegaScope 3D Glasses for the Sega Master System was released, and the Famicom 3D System for Nintendo's Famicom (NES) was launched only in Japan but met with limited success.Plunkett, Luke. Nintendo's First 3D Technology Shot A Spaceship At Mario's Face. Kotaku. 30 April 2010. The Taito Z System arcade game Continental Circus, the first stereoscopic 3D racing video game, also released in 1987. The SegaScope 3D, Famicom 3D System and Continental Circus all used active shutter 3D glasses. In 1988, the X-Specs 3D glasses including 3D game SpaceSpuds for Amiga were brought out by Haitex. =1990s= In 1991, the Sega VR was announced and demonstrated, a virtual reality helmet that was never distributed. In 1993 Pioneer released the LaserActive system which had a bay for various \\"PAC's\\" including the Sega PAC and the NEC PAC. The unit was 3D capable with the addition of the LaserActive 3D goggles (GOL-1) and an adapter (ADP-1). The Virtual Boy was brought out in 1995, a console equipped with a virtual reality helmet that provided a stereoscopic rendering of 384x224 pixels per eye in monochrome (black and red) and for which 12 games were available in late 1995. Marketing was a dismal failure and production was halted in late 1996. SimulEyes PC VR goggles (a consumer version of CrystalEyes), bundled with the game Descent: Destination Saturn, was released in 1995. In early 1997, Sega demonstrated an early glasses-free 3D display system, called the Floating Image System. It displayed 3D imaging based on a multi-layer parallax system, and was presented by Sega AM3's general manager Hisao Oguchi.Electronic Gaming Monthly, issue 93 (April 1997), page 22 Metabyte produced Wicked Vision the first driver that made a half-resolution stereo (sync doubling) of more than fifty gaming PC (Glide, Direct3D and miniOpenGL) 3Dfx Voodoo2 graphics card with infrared glasses H3D in 1998. A year later, Elsa Revelator released a similar driver for Direct3D that provided full resolution (page flipping) for stereo 3D on different graphics cards. =2000s= The Glasstron by Sony, mounted on a clear head The Nintendo Gamecube (and the Game Boy Advance to a lesser extent) had been built with Stereoscopic capabilities in mind, however the cost for the liquid crystals technology were prohibitively expensive at the time to make commercial sense. In 2001, NVIDIA brought out a driver based on Elsa technology that supported different types of glasses and screens, but only with their own graphics cards. The PUD-J5A for the PlayStation 2 was released in 2002, which incorporated virtual helmet technology (Glasstron) and was sold exclusively on the internet in Japan. It weighed , and used two screens of 108,000 pixels each (probably 450x240 pixels) and had a single game (Energy Airforce Aim Strike!). In 2005, the game Metal Gear Acid 2 was released on the PlayStation Portable from Sony with a stereoscopic rendering via the \\"Solid Eye\\" accessory that included a stereoscope lens cardboard that could never be reused. The EyeFX 3D shutter glasses for the PlayStation 2 was produced by SplitFish Gameware in 2006. This plugged into a joystick port of the console and added support for stereoscopic 3D in ten existing games. The 3D Vision kit for the latest generation of NVIDIA graphics cards was brought out in 2001, and combines a pair of LC shutter glasses as well as a wireless infrared transmitter connected to a USB driver for Windows. =2010s= In 2010, stereoscopic support for the PlayStation 3 was released via an automatic update of firmware. The new software includes a function for detection of 3D displays and a stereoscopic frame-buffer support. The first games in stereoscopic 3D included Wipeout HD and Super Stardust HD and coincided with the release of the 3D TV Bravia brand also by Sony. In the same year, a 3D Surround kit was brought out that works with the 3D Vision and several NVIDIA graphics cards with stereoscopic 3D support. The AMD HD3D added HDMI 1.4 support on ATI graphics cards for games in stereoscopic 3D using the drivers provided by iZ3D 3D stereo also in 2010. In October 2010 Josef Kunz published the app 'Difficult' in the apple appstore, a skill game, that uses a Side-by- side view, the first available 3D game for handhelds. The Nintendo 3DS, the first handheld with an autostereoscopic display using a parallax barrier and a resolution of 400x240 pixels per eye for stereoscopic 3D, was first produced in 2011. An XL version was released in 2012. In 2013, Nintendo filed a patent for the concept of using VR technology to produce a more realistic 3D effect on a 2D television. A camera on the TV tracks the viewer's location relative to the TV, and if the viewer moves, everything on the screen reorients itself appropriately. \\"For example, if you were looking at a forest, you could shift your head to the right to discover someone standing behind a tree.\\" See also *List of stereoscopic video games *List of Nvidia 3D Vision Ready games *List of Nintendo 3DS games *List of PlayStation 3 games with 3D support *List of Wii U games *List of Xbox 360 games with 3D support *3D film References External links * The History of Stereoscopic 3D Gaming PCWorld * Stereoscopic 3D video games and their effects on engagement Presentation on YouTube * What happened to the stereoscopic gaming revolution?

She was from the so-called 1980s Pictures Generation of artists, which included Cindy Sherman, Robert Longo, Jack Goldstein, Laurie Simmons and Richard Prince. These artists mixed elements of Conceptual Art and Pop Art, using images from popular culture to examine its powerful codes. Bender also designed the credits for the TV show America's Most Wanted, which Roberta Smith of the New York Times suggested in 2004 \\"may have originated the rapid-fire hyperediting now pervasive in film, television and video art.\\" She also directed music videos for such musicians as Babes in Toyland, edited music videos directed by Robert Longo, and designed sets for the choreographers Bill T. Jones and Molissa Fenley, including the former's Still/Here that New Yorker dance critic Arlene Croce condemned. Her work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Menil Collection in Houston. Early life She was born in Seaford, Delaware to Charles and Carolyn Bender, and had one brother and two sisters. Her childhood was characterized by the era of big Hollywood extravaganzas at local theaters and constant messaging by early television. Her parents had a general interest in art and instilled basic artistic techniques in her. This led her to develop an interest in pursuing traditional studio art.  Education  She earned a bachelor of fine arts from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1973. While earning her bachelors, her instructors emphasized the decorative nature of studio art, which turned Bender away from the general art curriculum. It was only later, when visiting the university art gallery, that she was introduced to a group exhibition of experimental artworks. It was this experience that exposed her to a new mindset of exploring and communicating ideas and visions that drew her to engage in various cultural examinations of the time. Bender then turned to the printmaking department, seeing it as the best place for radical discovery within the art school. It was here that she became interested in the silkscreening process because of its mass production potential and accessibility for a large audience. Early career After earning her bachelors, Bender moved to Washington, DC to continue her interest in printmaking by working at a feminist-Marxist silkscreening collective. At the collective she printed banners, T-shirts, and other materials for political demonstrations. These exercises helped her absorb crucial information related to the synthesis of art and politics (a practice relevant to her later work). Though her work in DC created a solid foundation for her future work, she felt the city was too constricting for young emerging artists. She was soon taken in by New York City and the large experimental performance scene many artists were involved in. Upon moving to New York in 1978, Bender befriended like-minded artists, including Eric Bogosian, Bill T. Jones, Robert Longo, Richard Prince, Cindy Sherman, and Arnie Zane. Emboldened by this supportive community, Bender continued working with the silkscreen process but this time on square tin panels, arranging them into numerous shapes. At this same time, she gradually began to incorporate abstract computer graphics into her work that were generated from media images found in network television. By 1982 Bender had found television to be a fruitful source of imagery that she could reprocess and recontexualize in her work. This became a differentiating advantage as most other artists at the time resisted using television because of the necessary technical skills. In a 1985 article in Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine, Bender asserted that ‚Äúartists should be spending their money on VCRs instead of paint and canvas.‚Äù This differentiation gave Bender the opportunity to exhibit widely at many locations, such as the alternative gallery Artists Space, and the progressive gallery Nature Morte. With this new-found medium, she taught herself how to edit and work with video and quickly put together her first media-theater piece. It included video, film, and slide projections that she orchestrated on a stage to create the effect of a media-image overload. She took video footage from television to examine corporate logos and the power structure the constitute in society. Her style began to evolve, combining live television, documentary, and abstract photo-panels, frequently with a chaotic aesthetic. Bender often silkscreened phrases and words directly onto the television screens. These slogans typically included phrases like ‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Going to Die,‚Äù and ‚ÄúPeople with AIDS.‚Äù Viewed through this augmented lens, each broadcast image appearing on the televisions became labeled with the jarring phrases printed on the screen. The superimposed texts became subliminal codes meant to awaken the viewer‚Äôs consciousness when encountering the controlled, mental-zombie state of television; and made viewers more critical of the content they were receiving and the various candy-coated images used to intrude them.  Later career  Bender continued to work with television, and began to group the electronic boxes into arrangements recalling the displays found in the television department of an electronics store, but with an unconscious and ideological discursive twist. In this way, Bender continued to explore the parasitic relationship between television and technology and its concomitant psychological manipulations. Through her eyes, humanity is composed of videodrome refugees. She had her first New York solo gallery show in the East Village in 1983 at the Nature Morte Gallery. She appropriated images from the Neo-Expressionist painters of her generation, and in her more dramatic pieces put computerized patterns together with grisly images from mass murders. A theme throughout her work is the contrast between the power of corporations and technology with the struggle of individual human beings. Eventually showing with Metro Pictures, her mid-career retrospective was organized by the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse in 1991, and toured internationally, as did her multimedia installations Total Recall (1987) and Dumping Core (1984). The former, along with Wild Dead (1984), which she showed at Danceteria, the New York City dance club, have been called her central installations from that decade. Total Recall, was an eight-channel installation with 24 TV monitors and two rear projections that combined corporate logos from TV commercials, computer-generated forms by Amber Denker, doctored clips from Salvador with a post-punk soundtrack by Stuart Argabright.Nelson, Solveig, Little Wolf, Wisconsin, Gretchen Bender, Artforum, Nov. 1, 2012.

Opened in December 2010, the expressway has reduced the travel time between Yangon and Mandalay to 7 hours from 13 hours by train and from 16 hours by the old highway. The highway, which does not meet international design, construction and safety standards has seen a spate of accidents since its opening. History Night view of Expressway The initial plans to build a highway between the two largest cities of the country were conceived in 1954 as part of the U Nu government's Pyidawtha Plan. In 1959, the United States offered financial and technical assistance for a \\"preliminary engineering survey\\" of the highway. The financial assistance was up to $750,000. When the survey was completed in 1960, the Burmese government balked at the cost as too expensive. In 1961, the US government agreed to finance another study of more economical alternatives. The survey work began in early 1962 but was only completed in December after having been delayed by the 1962 military coup by the Union Revolutionary Council in March 1962. The military government initially agreed to the new proposal, and authorized the design of the Yangon‚ÄìPegu stretch of the highway in March 1963. The design plans were ready by December 1963 but were never carried out. They fell victim to the deteriorating relations between the US and Burmese governments. The proposed road route lay between the old Yangon-Mandalay Highway and the Pegu Yoma Mountains. The Pegu Yoma Mountains were a strategically important location for the Communist Party of Burma. After the expulsion of the Communists from the area in 1973, the government planned the construction of the expressway. The government received a cement factory in Kyangin as development aid from Japan for the construction of the expressway. However, it had to export the cement from the new factory and due to the lack of foreign exchange abroad construction was cancelled. After the 8888 Uprising, the new military regime intensified private sector and infrastructure projects. New cement factories and steel production facilities were built by the state and private companies. To finance the foreign exchange, the government received in return for gas export to Thailand. In October 2005, construction began, and on 29 December 2010, the official opening of the entire route took place. Phases The expressway was inaugurated by the Ministry of Construction and the Directorate of Military Engineering of the Ministry of Defence. =Yangon‚ÄìNaypyidaw= * Construction period: October 2005 ‚Äì March 2009 * Opened: 25 March 2009 * Track length: * Number of bridges over : 40 =Naypyidaw‚ÄìMandalay= * Construction period: 2007 ‚Äì December 2010 * Opened: 29 March 2010 * Track length: * Number of bridges over : 32 =Mandalay (Saga-in)‚ÄìMandalay (Tagundaing)= * Building time: 2010 ‚Äì December 2011 * Opened: 30 December 2011 * Track length: * Number of bridges over : ? Specifications Rest area at junction The road surface comprises two layers of concrete: (1) an wide and thick lower layer, as well as (2) an wide, thick upper layer. The road can withstand 80 tons. The highway has two wide carriageways, divided by wide traffic islands, and a total of 842 box culverts, 1396 bridges and 116 underpasses. The speed limit is . =Tolls= Naypyidaw toll station The five toll stations of the expressway are located in Yangon, Pyu, Naypyidaw, Meiktila and Mandalay. Toll range from 4500 kyats for cars to 22,500 kyats for buses for the journey between Yangon and Mandalay. Trucks are not allowed on the highway. Standardization Traffic signs along the highway Mileposts on the YME use miles followed by furlongs (one-eighth of a mile) Milepost 355-2 south of Mandalay Safety message at Mile 355 south of Mandalay The highway traffic signs do not comply with international standards. The highway's curves are not built for banked turns, making turns more treacherous than necessary. According to exile-run news agencies The Irrawaddy and Mizzima, such failures may result in numerous accidents in the curves. Similarly, there are many accidents during the extension of the highway because there is no exit provided brake strip. It has been dubbed the \\"Death Highway\\" by some news agencies. According to police records, excessive speed is a major cause of accidents. Other causes include unsafe vehicles, the condition of the road surface and negligent driving. Rest areas, police stations and gas stations do not meet international standards. Many drivers are inexperienced when driving on highways, as well as lack sufficient knowledge of the Highway Code. Possible extension In 2014, the government plans to widen the road after many accidents on the expressway. The government has requested assistance from the USAID, JICA and KOICA to upgrade the road and widen it to eight lanes.

The bill was written in response to a scandal indicating that some VA hospitals were keeping secret waiting lists for care, the length of which may have led to the deaths of some veterans. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. It passed the House on May 21, 2014. Background In May 2014, questions involving substandard timely care and false records covering up related timelines came to light, involving treatment of veterans in a number of VA hospitals. Eric Shinseki, then Secretary of Veterans Affairs, resigned on May 30, 2014.Shinseki 'mad as hell' about VA allegations, but won't resign Senior Veterans Affairs officials reportedly kept secret waiting lists in order to hide the high number of veterans that were forced to wait for months to receive important medical care. As many as 450 senior officials may have been involved, including VA hospital managers. Some veterans died while they were still awaiting treatment. A VA department handbook on administrative policies indicates that employees have 30 days to appeal any disciplinary action before it can be taken and have all disciplinary actions or reprimands removed from their records after two years. The Department has to meet high standards for doing things like separately proving an employee was absent each and every day if the employee quits showing up to work and proving that there is a direct relationship between the misconduct and their own efficiency. Data provided by the Office of Personnel Management shows that only 7,349 federal employees were fired in 2013 out of a total of almost 2 million. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014 would authorize the United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to: (1) remove any individual from the Senior Executive Service upon determining that such individual's performance warrants removal, and (2) remove such individual from federal service or transfer the individual to a General Schedule position at any grade that the Secretary deems appropriate. The bill would require: (1) the Secretary to notify the United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs within 30 days after removing such an individual, and (2) such removal to be done in the same manner as the removal of a professional staff member employed by a Member of Congress. Procedural history The Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 11, 2014 by Rep. Jeff Miller (R, FL-1). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the United States House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, and the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The House voted in Roll Call Vote 229 on May 21, 2014 to pass the bill 390-33. Debate and discussion The Department of Veterans' Affairs released a statement opposing the bill, arguing that the bill \\"would generate serious unintended consequences that would prove counterproductive.\\" One alleged unintended consequence might be \\"any change that would single out VA employees for punishment or discharge could have a chilling effect on VA's ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees.\\" Their statement also indicated that they feared anyone fired could sue, leading to \\"lengthy litigation.\\" The House members who sponsored the bill argue that, although federal workers can be fired, the process is extremely lengthy, sometimes taking years, and that the officials who are \\"under scrutiny for neglecting veterans actually received tens of thousands of dollars in bonuses and positive performance reviews.\\" Rep. Jeff Miller, who sponsored the bill, said that \\"this bill would simply give the VA Secretary the authority to fire or demote VA Senior Executive Service employees based on performance, similar to the authority the Secretary of Defense already has to remove military general officers from command or how I am able to fire someone who works for me on my staff.\\" The organization AMVETS supported the legislation. National Commander John H. Miller Jr. said that \\"under the current, antiquated and morbidly dysfunctional civil service system, it's nearly impossible to dismiss or do more than slap the wrists of incompetent, ineffective and wasteful Senior Executive Service employees.\\" John Miller argued that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs needed \\"the ability to remove deadweight executives.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4031 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4031 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4031 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4031 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4031 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:United States Department of Veterans Affairs Category:Obama administration controversies ","title":"Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014"},{"id":"42766182","title":"Frank Perozo"},{"id":"42766183","text":"Molotov Solution is the first studio album by deathcore band Molotov Solution.

In general, a rotor may spin about an axis which is aligned substantially either vertically or side-to-side (spanwise). All three classes have been studied for use as lifting rotors and several variations have been flown on full-size aircraft, although only the vertical-axis rotary wing has become widespread on rotorcraft such as the helicopter. Some types provide lift at zero forward airspeed, allowing for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), as in the helicopter. Others, especially unpowered free-spinning types, require forward airspeed in the same manner as a fixed-wing aircraft, as in the autogyro. Many can also provide forward thrust if required. Types of rotor wing Many ingenious ways have been devised to convert the spinning of a rotor into aerodynamic lift. The various types of such rotor wings may be classified according to the axis of the rotor. Types include:Foshag & Boehler (1969)Seifert (2012) ;Vertical-axis *Conventional rotary wings as used by modern rotorcraft. ;Spanwise horizontal-axis *Wing rotor: an airfoil-section horizontal-axis rotor which creates the primary lift. *Magnus rotor: a rotor which creates lift via the Magnus effect. Flettner rotor: a smooth cylindrical Magnus rotor with disc end plates. Thom rotor: a smooth spinning cylinder with multiple discs along the span. *Cycloidal rotor or cyclorotor: a set of horizontal lifting aerofoils rotating around the rim of a supporting horizontal-axis rotor. (May be powered or unpowered.) An aircraft with a cycloidal rotor wing is called a cyclogyro. Some examples are hybrids comprising a cycloidal rotor around a central Magnus cylinder. *Cross-flow fan: a slatted cylindrical fan in a shaped duct. ;Longitudinal horizontal-axis *Radial-lift rotor: a substantially fore-aft axis rotor which creates lift through cyclic pitch variation. Self-propelling wing or Radial-lift rotor: a propeller or rotor with the rotation axis angled to the airflow to create a cyclic variation in pitch and hence a radial lift component. Radial-lift propeller with cyclic pitch control: a propeller capable of generating a sideways lift component. Conventional rotary wings Conventional rotorcraft have vertical-axis rotors. The main types include the helicopter with powered rotors providing both lift and thrust, and the autogyro with unpowered rotors providing lift only. There are also various hybrid types, especially the gyrodyne which has both a powered rotor and independent forward propulsion, and the stopped rotor in which the rotor stops spinning to act as a fixed wing in forward flight. Magnus rotors When a spinning body passes through air at right angles to its axis of spin, it experiences a sideways force in the third dimension. This Magnus effect was first demonstrated on a spinning cylinder by Gustav Magnus in 1872. If the cylinder axis is aligned spanwise (side to side) then forward movement through the air generates lift. The rotating body does not need to be a cylinder and many related shapes have been studied.Zipfel, Peter H.; \\"On Flight Dynamics of Magnus Rotors\\", Department of the Army, USA, 1970. =Flettner rotor= The Flettner rotor comprises a Magnus cylinder with a disc endplate at each end. The American Plymouth A-A-2004 floatplane had Flettner rotors in place of the main wings and achieved short flights in 1924. Cross-flow fan The cross-flow fan comprises an arrangement of blades running parallel to a central axis and aligned radially, with the fan partially or fully enclosed in a shaped duct. Due to the specific shaping, rotating the fan causes air to be drawn in at one end of the duct, passed across the fan and expelled at the other end. The FanWing is a lifting rotor which uses this principle. It can both provide forward thrust by expelling air backwards and augment lift, even at very low airspeeds, by also drawing the air downwards.Seyfang, G.R.; FanWing - Developments and Applications, ICAS 2012: 28th International Congress of the Aeronautical Sciences, 2012. A prototype UAV was flown in 2007. Radial-lift rotors During World War II Focke-Wulf proposed the Triebfl√ºgel, in which a tipjet-driven rotor wing is located around the fuselage waist. The proposed mode of operation was to land and take off as a tail-sitter, using the wing as a conventional rotor. The craft would then tilt over to horizontal flight and lift would be provided by cyclic pitch variation of the rotor wings, with the wing tip ramjets now angled to provide forward thrust.Sharp, D.; Luftwaffe: Secret Jets of the Third Reich, Mortons, 2015, Pages 98-101. A few years later the American Vought XF5U circular-winged fighter prototype was designed with large radial-lift propellers. These were angled upwards when the craft was on the ground, creating a cyclic variation in the blades' angle of attack or pitch when the craft was moving forwards. This cyclic variation induced a radial lifting component to the blades, when in the horizontal segment of rotation, which was intended to augment the wing lift. A prototype aircraft was completed but the project was closed before the prototype had flown.

According to the WHO, the country ranks 186th out of 191 eligible countries in life expectancy. The country also ranks 168 out of 188 in infant mortality rates, with a lower rank reflecting lower infant mortality. There are also about 97 infant mortalities out of 1,000. There are many cultural factors influencing the current health status of Uganda including the negative stigmas associated with sex, and the wood-burning stoves. The former[which?] of these has resulted in a severe lack in education and communication necessary to improve the health and well-being of children. There are multiple factors negatively impacting the health of children in Uganda. Those factors include HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, lack of sanitation, vaccinations, insufficient drugs, and an insufficient amount of motivated healthcare workers. The World Health Organization attributes the tragic situation to wars that occurred before 1986 as well as the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has resulted mainly from the mother-to-child transmission that spreads from one generation to the next, which could have easily been prevented from educating mothers and providing them with medical treatment. Medical treatment could protect them and their children. The knowledge of HIV, how people can contract it, their individual HIV status and counseling for the disease. These are several factors that assist in the prevention of HIV/AIDS and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which is the leading cause of the detrimental state of child health in Uganda.  HIV/AIDS  HIV/AIDS is likely the leading health risk facing Ugandan children; it affects many facets of their physical and mental health in a variety of ways. It is the leading cause of death in Uganda, as reported by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in 2010. The CDC has been fairly active in the country, working in cooperation with government organizations as well as a number of other partners. Their work has been on multiple fronts including door to door HIV counseling and testing. Despite these and many other efforts, there are poor rates of treatment of children. Of the 190,000 HIV-positive children in Uganda, only 35,500 received Antiretroviral medication (ARV). Uganda is not alone in this, in 21 high burden African countries, only 34 percent of eligible children receive ARVs, compared to 68 percent of adults. In addition, many of the children that receive medication have been found to lack the necessary diligence in their drug therapy routine. Many children find the medication unpleasant and are not even aware of their HIV status. Part of this can be attributed to lapses in communication. For example, it is common practice not to inform children of their HIV status until they reach 13 years of age. Sexual lifestyles are typically frowned upon in Uganda, particularly for women, which contributes to a poor dissemination of sexual related health information. Research has shown that efforts to improve health and awareness of parents and guardians, as well as the communities, of children with HIV/AIDS could be an effective way to improve treatment. Increased education and awareness can help with communication breakdowns and access to resources. These efforts can also help decrease mother-to-child transmissions. It is estimated that 91,000 infants are born each year to HIV-positive women. Only 51.6 percent of these women receive any sort of mother-to-child HIV prevention and about 24 percent of all 110,000 new HIV infections in Uganda in 2009 were a result of mother-to-child transmission. A study published by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a very effective management strategy, in terms of efficacy as well as cost, for prevention of mother-to-child transmissions. In addition, often material support for parents/guardians can be an effective strategy in improving care and treatment of children, including funding for food, clothing, and educational expenses. To date, most of Uganda's policies to combat AIDS have focused on abstinence and fidelity, both preventative measures while little action has been taken around youth education. The main tool of this strategy is the controversial ABC campaign (Abstinence, Be faithful, and use Condoms). While initially believed to be a successful approach, the effectiveness of this strategy is currently inconclusive as more recent studies have found that increased condom use and deaths have been responsible for the decreases in HIV infections.According to recent studies, Uganda has made a decrease in the HIV prevalence in the country. There was a reduction among children from 27,660 in 2011 to 9,629 in 2013, which measured up to the National Priority Action Plan target for 2013 which was 10,000. Adolescent girls are a group that is most severely impacted and most at risk compared to other groups of the population. Two-thirds of new HIV infections were found in this section of the population. The number of deaths decreased for children under 4 years old from 100,000 between 2000 and 2012, while the number of deaths in adolescent girls increased from below 50,000 to over 100,000 between 2000 and 2012(UNICEF, 2013). 2013 studies have shown that children below 15 years old account for 11% of HIV cases. According to UNAIDS, \\"HIV cases were lower among pregnant adolescents at 3% compared to older pregnant women at 4.9%, availability of anti-retroviral therapy was lower among adolescents at 94% than older pregnant women at 99%\\". Additionally, due to the fact that there is still 18% of HIV cases coming from mother-to-child transmissions, the world health organization has been efficiently sending out revised WHO guidelines to protect mothers and their babies and make certain that HIV infected mothers and their children receive triple antiretroviral prophylaxis during labor, breastfeeding and throughout the rest of life. HIV positive mothers with access to elimination of mother- to-child transmission (EMTCT) assistance has increased to 85% and thirty-three districts have full coverage now (UNICEF Uganda). On the other hand, pregnant women in four districts did not receive antiretroviral therapy and in only 29% of districts HIV infected women were given antiretroviral therapy. Overall, mother to child transmission treatment coverage has greatly increased, but there is still a significant amount of unmet need across the country for women and children.  Malnutrition  Malnutrition plagues much of Uganda's youth. According to a study by the World Food Programme (WFP), roughly one-third of Ugandan children have stunting, a permanent condition resulting from lack of proper nutrition during the first 5 years of life. Consequences of this have been found to be very costly to the Ugandan government and economy, with estimated losses totaling at US$899 million annually, or 5 percent of the country's GDP. Stunting in children occurs when a child is severely malnourished which leads to the child being much shorter than the average height for their age. This condition happens over a long period of time where the child is deprived of proper nutrition and infections which also arise more easily in undernourished children. According to the World Health Organization, 23.8% were short for age and 6.9% were extremely stunted. Along with stunting, malnutrition also caused children to be underweight. According to the United States National Center for Health Statistics, 24.1% of children were underweight based on weight, age, and gender. Kwashiorkor is a kind of protein-energy malnutrition that is caused by repeated infections, specifically diarrheal disease. According to PEDIATRICS, \\"Edema must be present in order for a nutritional deficit is classified as Kwashiorkor and only 3.8% of the total sample had Kwashiorkor\\". Another condition named Marasmus occurs in children when they experience critical undernourishment that causes their weight to be lower than the appropriate weight for their age. The widespread presence of low MUAC (mid-upper arm circumference) was also a health issue attributed to critical malnourishment. Children that had weighed too little for their height had a condition called wasting. Wasting is used as an evaluation of short-term malnourishment principally after an ailment occurred.  Vaccinations  Vaccinations is a preventative method that can limit and terminate infectious diseases, which can eliminate the possibility of millions of deaths per year. It is a very cost-effective way to manage the overall health of a population. While many efforts are currently in place in Uganda to distribute vaccinations to children, it is still a very serious health concern. About 2 million deaths each year in Uganda are a result of vaccine preventable diseases. Tuberculosis is one example of these, which was found to be the 4th leading cause of death in Uganda in 2010 according to the CDC. In 2001, it was found that 63% of children less than one year old had either failed to complete their vaccination schedule or not had any vaccinations at all. A 2012 study found that vaccination rates can be improved by providing additional support to mothers to enable them to make use of immunization services. Recently, Uganda has been improving and diligently working on the availability of vaccinations to children. The World Health Organization is supporting Uganda in its health and vaccination efforts along with the Global Vaccination Action Plan. According to the National Administrative Immunization Performance Analysis, \\"22 out of Uganda's 112 districts have a good availability and use of immunization services.\\" The services help about 80% of the children. Despite the tremendous health efforts, the overall vaccination availability and access is poor. According to WHO, \\"22% and 18% of Ugandan children still do not have essential vaccines. Uganda has one of the highest rank for unimmunized children.  Wood-burning stoves  Traditionally in Uganda, as in most developing countries, open word- burning stoves are commonly used for cooking and to heat homes. It has been estimated that 95 percent of Ugandans rely on wood or charcoal for cooking.Many women using these wood-burning stoves to cook are unaware of the severe health issues it can cause to them and their children. Fumes from the stove are dense in particles containing harmful gases such as sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and various other harmful gases. These gases are harmful to the environment and to people inhaling the fumes. Inhaling such dangerous fumes can induce cancerous disease or even death. In addition to inducing cancerous disease, the fumes from the stove can damage eyesight. After long- term use, the smoke degrades eye sight and causes visual impairments. Along with eyesight impairment, the smoke causes other illnesses such as chronic bronchitis, lung infections, asthma, cataract, low birth weight, and stillbirths. The chemical pollutants in smoke also induce dizziness and irritation to the respiratory system. According to the World Health Organization, \\"there are over 200 different chemicals and compounds in wood smoke that are hazardous enough to damage human health. Many women and girls are utilizing the wood-burning stoves every day and are not aware of the harmful effects it is having and will have on their health. Pregnant women are inhaling fumes that are harmful to them and their unborn baby which can lead to birth defects. = Interventions = Many homes in Uganda still have inadequate ventilation stoves because they are unable to afford stoves with better ventilation. Women and girls need to be educated on how to efficiently cook and save themselves and the environment while still using the poorly ventilated stoves. The CECOD, a non-governmental organization in Uganda, has a purpose to create stoves that save energy and don't use a lot of wood which will reduce the deforestation. The CECOD has also created eco schools that educate students about the environment and how to save the environment. Students in these eco schools learn and bring what they learned home, which helps to spread the knowledge and further save the environment.  Sanitary pads  One health issue facing female children specifically in Uganda as well as many other developing countries is the inability to afford sanitary pads. Besides the obvious health and sanitation concerns, this problem also often has harmful effects on education. Due to the fact that menstruation is not an openly discussed topic, many school girls have to suffer and are often distracted by the thought of soiling their clothes. On top of worrying about soiling their clothes, they are also worried about the embarrassment it can bring. Other children at school will laugh at them and ridicule them. That is part of the reason why some girls just don't go back to school because they can't handle the hassle of menstruation while focusing on schoolwork. Evaluations by the Kasiisi Project, a non-profit organization working in rural Western Uganda, found that girls will often skip school or drop out altogether as a result of menstruation and insufficient resources and facilities associated with it. Their problem would be resolved if they were able to afford sanitary pads, but most are not. Most girls use rags and toilet paper while menstruating. According to research by Build Africa, \\"29.7% of girls said they missed at least four days per cycle, which included class presentations, exams, and new topics being taught. Another 24.3% of girls in the study said they were condemned whenever their uniform was soiled while on their period.\\" Because of that many girls just decide to drop out. Menstruation is something that is kept quiet and many people, especially boys are not educated on what menstruation actually is. Some boys think it is an illness instead of a part of human nature for women. To make the problem worse, \\"about 24.7% of girls say their parents did not talk with them about menstruation and body changes they will go through as they get older. When discussing female health issues such as menstruation and puberty many girls only have senior women teachers at their school to talk to, which is a lot for the senior women alone to handle. So, young girls in Uganda are going through a really hard time with going through physical changes they do not understand while being ridiculed. According to research by Build Africa, \\"about 90% of girls say they use a rag to pad themselves\\". They hang the rags to dry them but take them down before anyone sees them because it is seen as an embarrassment. However, rags are sometimes taken down that are not fully dried and girls still wear them. Bacterial-blood infiltrated rags could lead to health issues in the future and vaginal infections. These girls get vaginal infections which can lead to reproductive issues in the future and even make some of them infertile.  Road Map campaign  In 2008, Janet Museveni launched the Road Map campaign in an effort to coordinate efforts to lower maternal and neonatal death rates in Uganda.She created the Elimination of Mother-to-Child- Transmission of HIV Campaign in Moroto. This campaign was part of the government's efforts to prevent HIV from affecting future generations like how it has affected past generations. Part of the campaign is the promotion of ART (antiretroviral therapy) where all pregnant women with HIV are given antiretroviral therapy for life. Uganda was one of the first developing countries to offer life-saving treatment to people infected with HIV. According to UNAIDS, \\" new infections among children decreased from 27,000 in 2009 to 15,000 in 2012, a 49% drop and the number of women with access to prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV assistance also increased at a fast rate from 45% in 2011 to 73% in 2012. Through this campaign the Ugandan government has shown that Africans can have access to preventative treatment and that HIV/AIDS can be conquered. This campaign has also shown the motivation and effort put into having a new generation free from HIV.  Malaria  The infectious disease called Malaria is induced by parasites that are spread to humans through mosquito bites, particularly female Anopheles mosquitoes. This infectious disease is parasitic and attacks red blood cells. It is the prime cause of death among children and pregnant women in Africa. Children and women infected with the disease have symptoms including chills, high fevers, fatigue, headaches, nausea, shivering, and pain in limbs. If the person is infected with the disease over a long period of time they can contract anemia, jaundice, and low blood sugar. A person with a very strong strain of malaria can contract cerebral malaria and at its most critical state cerebral malaria can cause delirium or seizures and can lead to coma. An outbreak of malaria occurs in certain regions for various reasons. Uninfected or partially infected people that move into a new area where malaria is widespread can cause an outbreak. Infected people moving into an area where malaria is not present but conditions permit the disease to thrive may also cause an outbreak. In situations where the mosquito carrying the disease is partly eliminated can cause a reoccurrence of the outbreak in that region. Young children and pregnant women are at a higher risk of contracting malaria due to the fact that they have a weaker immune system. Young children and pregnant women in rural areas with little knowledge of malaria, minimal financial and medical aid are also at a higher risk of developing malaria than other individuals. Malaria is one of the leading causes of death among youth. Statistics portray that Uganda has the world's highest amount of malaria cases. According to New Vision, \\"the malaria incidence rate is 478 cases per 1,000 people per year\\". About 70,000 to 100,000 people are dying from the disease and about half are children under 5 years old. Malaria is a pandemic in the country because millions of children and women are dying every year from the disease. To add to the problem many do not have access to preventative treatments and many children do not have access to preventative mosquito nets or mosquito sprays. According to the World Health Organization, \\"sub-saharan Africa was the source of 88% of malaria incidences and the source of 90% of deaths caused by malaria. Preventative methods have been put into place but have not made a large impact and still need to be improved. Drug- resistant strains broke out and still have not been dealt with appropriately. Residual spraying inside homes and buildings has not widely impacted the country. Only small regions of the country are efficiently and effectively using this method, which in turn has allowed the disease to continue spreading. Mosquito nets that are provided are not strong enough, damaged easily, and some people don't know how to use them correctly. = Lack of malaria vaccine = Currently, there is no malaria vaccine. It is a very perplexing vaccine to make. According to the World Health Organization, \\"the complexity of the malaria parasite has made the creation of a malaria vaccine difficult.\\" Malaria is caused by a variety of species of the Plasmodium protozoan and the virus of the antigens are always changing which is why creating a vaccine is so difficult. The easiest way to prevent malaria is to stay away from areas where malaria is present. In regions where mosquitos are prevalent, it is essential to sleep under mosquito nets that are treated with insecticide. It is also essential to take prescription medication that will prevent a malaria infection. People can also prevent malaria just by wearing long sleeves and insect repellant.  Healthcare workers  Among the multiple factors contributing to the poor health of children in Uganda, lack of healthcare workers is another factor adding to the problem. The healthcare workers that are absent most of the time are the highly trained doctors and clinical officers. According to IntraHealth, \\"results from a recent study in Uganda show that healthcare workers are missing from their position 35% of the time.\\" Only about half of nursing positions are occupied in public health facilities in Uganda. The critical lack of staffing of healthcare workers can create an absence of motivation and responsibility among healthcare workers that are filling positions. When workers are not satisfied, they are not motivated which can negatively impact the health of the community they are serving in. Poorly motivated healthcare workers are more prone to leave their jobs for better opportunities elsewhere, in a more developed country. In the situation that Uganda is in, they can not afford to lose any more of their healthcare workers. Healthcare workers are absent for several reasons. They are absent because some are furthering education, sickness, problems with housing or transport, social obligations, and disaster-related issues. Another element adding to the absence of healthcare workers is that they are not being held accountable by their supervisors. IntraHealth researchers did a study on the reason healthcare workers are absent most of the time. They interviewed several supervisors in public health facilities. They asked interviewees if there was a government policy on being absent and 33% said no, although there is a human resource policy that governs employees across the entire government. 11% of interviewees said they did not monitor staff coming and going and 14% said they did not use a reporting book. Supervisors were also asked another question whether or not they are included in decisions permitting their staff to be absent for extended periods of time, and 12% said no. So, the lack of accountability and motivation is a major contributing factor in the absenteeism of many healthcare workers in Uganda. The accountability of healthcare workers needs to be maintained as well as the motivation of the workers. Accountability can be maintained by keeping track of all workers and ensuring they are working when they are supposed to be working and giving punishment for any workers that are out of work without approval from their supervisor. Motivation can be maintained by a positive relationship with supervisors and co-workers, sufficient career progression, sufficient compensation, and satisfactory working environment.  Drug shortage  There is a shortage of essential drugs in Uganda that are needed to treat the most prevalent diseases amongst children in the country. According to Uganda Country Working Group, \\"32% - 50% of vital medications to treat the most common disease such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, TB, diabetes, diarrhea, and hypertension are not easily accessible. This crisis is occurring because a serious stockout is occurring in hospitals and clinics. There was a national stockout for a drug called Coartem which is the drug used to treat malaria. Due to this national stockout, malaria was being medicated with quinine but quinine was not available so caretakers had to break the adult tablet into smaller pieces and in other cases where the adult dosage was unavailable, adults were given the child dosage. Some patients across the country are forced to travel far distances to other hospitals and clinics where drugs are still inaccessible, taking alternative treatments, or just waiting at home to die. According to doctors, \\"the drug shortage could lead to treatment failure and resistance to drugs\\". The drug stockouts detrimentally affect 31.1% of Ugandans that live on a dollar a day by forcing them to pay for much higher priced medications from private hospitals and clinics. Those Ugandans that are surviving on a dollar a day most likely cannot afford the medication from a private facility so they are forced to do without and end up dying. Medication is usually one of the largest health expenses for people in developing countries and the stockouts only added to the severity of the problem. According to a survey done by the Uganda Country Working Group, \\"the accessibility of Coartem, was 28% in the private sector, drugs for children were constantly below 30% in the private sector, Amoxillin delay was 13%, and Cotrimoxazole (Septrin) delay was 29% which is the medication for upper respiratory tract infection, leading cause of death in children.\\" Anti- diabetic medications were less than 50% in the public sector and hypertension medications were also less than 50% in public hospitals and clinics. = Reasons for drug shortage = Drug shortage is the result of medication theft, corrupt government and lack of prioritization. The constant low accessibility of essential child medications such as hypertension and diabetics portrays a lack of prioritization for child health in the country. The lack of prioritization and availability of vital medications is increasing the health epidemic in Uganda amongst children. The National Medical Store of Uganda is not the only supplier of drugs in the country and they only supply 30‚Äì40% of drugs. The rest of the drugs are bought by the government. This shows that the widespread stockout of drugs has to be from misconduct amongst the government, which is the main distributor of drugs across the country. The main reason for drug shortages are the corrupt government not buying drugs and using the money for other purposes or selling drugs to private hospitals and clinics. Another major cause of drug shortage is theft of medications. Some districts also delay sending orders for medications but the National Medical Store has a schedule they follow of which regions they go to on what days. So, if districts delay sending order then they have to wait for the next time the delivery truck is set to deliver to their region.  References  9\\\\. \\"Situation Analysis of Children in Uganda\\".

Origins  59 Productions was founded in Edinburgh by Leo Warner and Mark Grimmer. Early projects included the video design for Stellar Quines Theatre Company's Sweet Fanny Adams in Eden (2003), followed by the video design for the recently formed National Theatre of Scotland's Roam (2006) and Black Watch (2006), which featured in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Shortly after the success of the show, which won multiple awards at Edinburgh Festivals, a Critics' Circle Theatre Award, a South Bank Sky Arts Award, four Critics' Awards for Theatre in Scotland, four Laurence Olivier Awards, and a New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, 59 Productions relocated to London, where they began a series of collaborations at the Royal National Theatre, causing critics to say that the company had \\"created an entirely new art form.\\" 59's Leo Warner and Mark Grimmer were part of the original creative team for War Horse in 2007, which went on to win six Laurence Olivier Awards in London and five Tony Awards for the subsequent production on Broadway. 59 Productions undertook its first opera in 2007 at the English National Opera, providing the projection design for Philip Glass's Satyagraha, directed by Phelim McDermott and designed by Julian Crouch of Improbable theatre. This was the first of several collaborations with Improbable theatre, including the design for the Metropolitan Opera's 125th Anniversary Gala in 2009, which raised more than $10 million. In 2012, Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle asked 59 Productions to provide the animation and projection design for the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, viewed by an audience of over a billion people. At around the same time, 59 was also asked to lead the design of the David Bowie is exhibition for the Victoria and Albert Museum, marking the company's expansion into the world of exhibition design. The exhibit was described as \\"brought to life by technology and united in sound and vision in a way rarely seen in a museum.\\" The company was commissioned to \\"Light the Sails\\" at Sydney Opera House for the 2014 VIVID Live festival. In 2015 they were responsible for the projection design for the first-ever Broadway production of George Gershwin's An American in Paris (film). The production went on to win 4 Tony Awards, including Best Scenic Design of a Musical for Bob Crowley and 59 Productions. In July 2016, 100 years to the day since William E. Boeing turned his attention to the thrilling and world-changing field of aviation, 59 Productions mounted an immersive show on a vast scale ‚Äì The Boeing Centennial Projection Spectacular ‚Äì a celebration of the Boeing company's centenary, for more than 80,000 spectators, across 30 performances, at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington. The show featured an animated sequence projection-mapped onto the body of a Boeing 747, telling the history of the iconic aircraft, as well as a specially commissioned soundtrack by composer, Jeff Beale. In 2017, the company developed and produced their first self-initiated production, an adaptation of Paul Auster's City of Glass, written by Duncan Macmillan. City of Glass was a co-production with the Lyric Hammersmith, HOME Manchester and Karl Sydow. The production was described by The Daily Telegraph as a \\"Neo-noir thriller that rewrites the rulebook for theatre design.\\" In 2018, 59 Productions provided both set and projection design for The Last Ship, the Sting musical which tells the story of the shipbuilding industry in the North East of England. The production opened at Northern Stage before embarking on a UK tour. Other recent projects include the design of Marnie, an opera by Nico Muhly which transferred to the Metropolitan Opera after an initial run at the English National Opera in London. The company also designed large scale events in 2018 for both the BBC First Night of the Proms at The Royal Albert Hall, and the Edinburgh International Festival. Alongside their work for the stage, 59 Productions also made two award-winning VR films in 2018, Grenfell: Our Home, a collaboration with Parable and Channel 4 which won the Audience Award at Sheffield Doc Fest; and Nothing To Be Written, commissioned by the BBC, winner of Best UK Experience at Raindance. In November 2018, their film collaboration with composer Eric Whitacre and NASA, Deep Field, premiered at Kennedy Space Center. Now employing 35 people worldwide, with offices in London and New York, 59 Productions works in set design, video projection design, exhibition and events design, film, theatre, and interactive production. The company expanded in 2016 to include an architecture department with a particular focus on design for performance environments, and an interest in developing forms of architectural expression which are fundamentally narratively led.

The greatest impact the bicycle had on the role of women occurred in the 1890s during the bicycle craze that swept American and European society. During this time, the primary achievement the bicycle gained for the women's movement is that it gave women a greater amount of social mobility. The feminist Annie Londonderry accomplished her around-the-globe bicycle trip as the first woman in this time. Due to the expense and various payment plans offered by American bicycle companies, the bicycle was affordable to everyone in society. However, the bicycle impacted upper and middle class white women the most. This transformed their role in society from remaining in the private or domestic sphere as caregivers, wives, and mothers to one of greater public appearance and involvement in the community. Bikes in Space is a series of sci-fi books themed around bicycling and feminism. Pre‚Äìbicycle craze cycling Before the 1890s, the bicycle was a vastly different vehicle and was by no means popular. Between the 1860s and the mid-1880s, the standard bicycle was the ordinary or high wheeler, which was both hard to master and dangerous to use. While the ordinary was exclusively used by men, women were allowed to use bicycles such as the two-seater sociable, the tandem, and the tricycle. Beginning in the late 1860s companionate riding became a popular social activity for men and women. These vehicles allowed men and women to develop new methods of coed socialization. However, up until the mid 1880s, women were primarily dependent upon men in order to participate in cycling. The presence of a man in control of the sociable assumed that the man could keep the woman safe from the dangers of riding a bike alone, thereby assuming the authority of man. So while companionate riding was revolutionary in the development in sociability between men and women, it kept women in an inferior position to men by assuming that the man had the power over the bicycle in that situation. Clothing Cycling in Amsterdam, 2014 Cycling in Amsterdam, 2009 Between 1885 and 1895, inventors and engineers vastly improved the previous generation of bicycle to what was then called safety bicycle. With these developments, a type of safety bicycle was designed for women in particular with a drop frame in order to accommodate women‚Äôs clothes. However, the long skirts and the tight-fitted bodices of this time period made cycling an even greater challenge. Therefore, several modified outfits were offered to women that would accommodate the bicycle. Some modifications included divided skirts, skirts that shortened with drawstrings, skirts that converted to bloomers, skirt-securing devices that kept the fabric close to the ankle, and a bicycle corset consisting of a sturdy, straight under-bodice with extra back support and a looser fit. Of all the bicycle costumes, the bloomer costume was and still is the most widely known from this time period. This consisted of full trousers, gathered at the ankle, worn with a calf-length skirt with a fashionable jacket on top. These clothes were met with mixed approval. Elizabeth Cady Stanton in her notes on whether or not women should ride a bicycle stated, \\"To sum up, I would say, let women ride .... If some prefer the [bulk] skirts flying in the wind exhausted in the wheels let them run the risk of their folly; If others prefer bloomers let them enjoy their choice- if others prefer knickerbockers, leave them in peace.\\" In instructive books written for women on how to ride a bicycle, many authors insist that wearing bicycle costumes made it easier to ride. In both cases, it seems that the decision to wear these athletic costumes was a personal choice for women. By making this choice, women to a small degree were able to take control of their life. At the same time, it was presented as a rational choice as wearing the full fashion of the time could make cycling more difficult for the rider. Because of this the decision to wear these clothes was closely related to the decision to ride a bicycle. For the most part, men were the main opponents of women wearing bicycle clothing and in particular, bloomers. This can be seen in a lot of songs from this time period. For example, a rendition of ‚ÄúMary Had a Little Lamb‚Äù from 1895 written by Stanislaus Stange had a verse that went: In this case, the very idea of the bicycle suit and women's potential to wear it disturbed some men. They saw these suits and in particular bloomers as ugly or shameful. In particular, they saw these bicycle costumes as a physical representation of women stealing men‚Äôs characteristics, thereby blurring the lines between femininity and masculinity and what is socially acceptable for each group. What this fear reveals is a realistic notion that women were taking on a greater role of independence of which had previously been characterized as masculine. 19th-century medicine During the late nineteenth century, doctors began encouraging everyone in public to exercise more often and cycling became a popular activity in which to do so. However, doctors were worried about the effects of excessive cycling, particularly how it affected women. An 1895 article in ‚ÄúThe Literary Digest‚Äù reviewed literature from the time period, which discussed the bicycle face, and noted that The Springfield Republican warned against excessive cycling by ‚Äúwomen, girls, and middle-aged men.‚Äù The bicycle face was described as a face usually flushed, but sometimes pale, often with lips more or less drawn, and the beginning of dark shadows under the eyes, and always an expression of weariness. These articles pushed forth the belief that excessive cycling made women vulnerable to many diseases such as developing an exophthalmic goiter, appendicitis, and internal inflammation. His article was subsequently discussed and analyzed in The Advertiser. Overall, these diagnoses reflect on how doctors during this time period viewed women and their bodies as weak. Another concern doctors had about women riding the bicycle was over their sexual health. Doctors believed that the bicycle saddle taught masturbation to women and girls. Riding astride anything was seen as too masculine for any proper woman. These physicians wrote in detail in medical journals about how the bicycle could be used for masturbation: These doctors were not concerned with sexual health, but rather sexual morality. Young women were supposed to be chaste and pure. They were trained from a young age to guard their sexual innocence. The fact that the bicycle had potential to awaken sexual feelings in women not only threatened their sexual purity, but also threatened to destroy gender definitions of sexual morality. Therefore, the bicycle is seen again as blurring the definition of masculine and feminine characteristics. At the same time as male doctors were stating the capabilities of women and the weakness of their bodies in relation to the bicycle, women began to express what their bodies were capable of through magazine articles. Women like Mary Bisland, Mary Sargent Hopkins, and Emma Moffett Tyng contested medical commonplaces and promoted new ones in their place. These women stated that cycling brought long-inactive muscles back to life, and helped riders feel better emotionally and encouraged women to use their own experiences with the bicycle to determine their physical limits. These women brought to public attention the positive aspects that help women riders. The bicycle not only makes them literally stronger, but also makes them more confident in their own abilities. This in turn not only gives women a greater agency over their body, but also mentally strengthens them to take on their previous domestic role and explore new roles in the public sphere. Bicycle enthusiasts disagreed with this medical assessment, and asserted that the physical activity was good to improve one's health and vitality. Solo female bicycle travelers Woman in bicycle clothes and buttoned on skirt that also can be used as raincoat Bicycle touring is a type of adventure travel, whereby a traveler uses a bicycle as the major means of transportation. A bicycle traveler might also use panniers to transport her equipment. Such travel can be almost completely self-sustained and autonomous, once the equipment includes a tent, cooking tools, a medical pack, repair tools, cooking fuel, water containers and multiple days of food supplies. Women Cycle the World is one of the many websites, which offer a list solo female long-distance cyclists and their blog. For instance, Rebecca Lowe crossed Iran, Dervla Murphy crossed Afganistan and Helen Lloyd crossed Africa. The book WOW ‚Äî Women on Wheels by solo female cycle traveler Loretta Henderson reported a global number of 245 solo female cycle travelers. Annie Londonderry is the first woman to have cycled the world as early as in 1894‚Äì95. Issues of safety and security for solo female long-distance cyclists are often raised by those meeting them for the first time. Such sources often come off with encouraging answers and useful advices, such as researching road and destination, staying visible on the road, and planning lodging options such as camping, bed and breakfast and Warm Showers ahead. Publications During the 1890s, many women and some men wrote self-help books in order to help women learn how to ride a bicycle. Within these books, they gave tips and personal reflections about the impact of the bicycle on their lives. Frances Elizabeth Willard, the national president of the Woman‚Äôs Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) wrote a book called ‚ÄúA Wheel Within A Wheel‚Äù, in which she discusses the exhilaration and health benefits she received by learning to ride as well as how she used cycling as a compelling social activity to stop men and women from drinking. Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote that the bicycle was a tool which motivated women to gain strength and take on increased roles in society. Susan B. Anthony stated in 1896: \\"Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel.\\" Beatrice Grimshaw, who went on to a life of travel and adventure, describes a girlhood of Victorian propriety, in which she was: \\"the Revolting Daughter‚Äìas they called them then. I bought a bicycle, with difficulty. I rode it unchaperoned, mile and miles beyond the limits possible to the soberly trotting horses. The world opened before me. And as soon as my twenty-first birthday dawned, I went away from home, to see what the world might to give to daughters who revolted.\\" Within the experiences of all these women, they indicate a similar experience of the world opening up to them. In the literal sense, they could leave the private sphere for the public sphere and in doing so escape the cult of domesticity in which societal norms kept them imprisoned. At the same time, they see the potential for new opportunities in which women can take an active role within their community. Through these readings, the women begin to see their potential as active and independent members of society.

Career  Glaser started her career as a printer. Glaser became a photographer when she began using an underwater Instamatic camera. Glaser learned to scuba dive, and with her underwater camera, she began photographing the springs of North and Central Florida with available light alone. Glaser captured photographs of manatees and other wildlife before shifting focus to the underwater landscapes. She saw the underwater scenes as not only habitats for wildlife, but also as landscapes able to stand on their own as meaningful artworks. Glaser later continued her photography at the Big Cypress National Preserve and Everglades National Park. In 2014, her work was part of an exhibition on display at the Harn Museum of Art in Gainesville, Florida titled \\"The Mark of Water: Florida's Springs and Swamps by Karen Glaser.\\" Speaking of her work, Glaser stated \\"I didn't learn how to photograph under water.

Background Founded in September 2012 by a Latakian veteran of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War known as Abu Omar al-Jamil, Ansar al-Sham brought together a wide range of mostly Syrian fighters in northern Latakia Governorate on a conservative Sunni Islamist platform. The group's military leader is a Chechen known as Abu Musa al-Shishani. As of March 2014, Ansar al-Sham fighters each receive a $60 salary every month. The group primary recruits local Syrians but is also open to foreign fighters willing to join the group, most of its members have been described as a mix of Syrian Army defectors, shopkeepers, and farmers. The group also allegedly received funding from Saudi Arabia, however in 2015 Saudi Arabia considered listing the group as a terrorist organization. During the 2014 Latakia offensive the Free Syrian Army reportedly gave the group $500,000 to support the group. =Ideology= The group has the goal of overthrowing the Syrian Government and establishing an Islamic state in its place, though the group does have an Islamist ideology it has been described as vague compared to other factions in the country including allies of the group such as Ahrar al-Sham. The vagueness of the group's ideology has helped it recruit Sunni Syrians from several backgrounds with wide ranges of beliefs.https://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi- bin/groups/view/531#cite21 =Relations with other groups= According to one of the group's commanders it does not work directly with the Free Syrian Army, but cooperates with FSA commanders on local levels when needed, and it does not fight against the FSA either. Many commanders of the group condemned the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant for one of its commanders killing an FSA commander that the group was allied with, and also held tensions with ISIL, however the group did not cut ties with ISIL, as many members of Ansar al-Sham had familial ties to ISIL members in Latakia and many ISIL members in the area were former Ansar al-Sham members. After the incident in which the ISIL commander known as Abu Ayman al-Iraqi killed the FSA commander, Ansar al- Sham's military commander Abu Musa al-Shishani along with Muslim Shishani the leader of Junud al-Sham, and Sayfullakh Shishani a commander in Jaish al- Muhajireen wal-Ansar helped mediate the tensions between the FSA and ISIL preventing an armed confrontation between the two in late 2013.http://www.chechensinsyria.com/?p=26193#more-26193 Ansar al-Sham also held good relations with the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, Jabhat al-Nusra and favored its approach of overthrowing the Syrian government before establishing an Islamic government in contrast to ISIL's approach. Along with having positive ties to al-Nusra the group also held a good relationship with Harakat Sham al-Islam which was composed Moroccan fighters, and another group known as the Ansar al-Mujahedin Battalion.https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/55066 History In December 2012, Ansar al-Sham joined with other Sunni Islamist and Salafist groups to found the Syrian Islamic Front umbrella organisation, in November 2013 the SIF was dissolved and Liwa al-Haqq, Ansar al-Sham and Ahrar ash-Sham joined the broader Islamic Front alliance. Ansar al-Sham played a lead role in the 2014 Latakia offensive against government forces. On 15 December 2016, the group declared that it decided to completely merge under Jaysh al-Islam's Idlib branch. On 25 January 2017, Jaysh al-Islam's Idlib branch joined Ahrar al-Sham, thus Ansar al-Sham also joined. On 7 February 2017, Ansar al-Sham defected from Ahrar al-Sham to join Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). At dawn on 23 August 2018, Tahrir al-Sham and Turkistan Islamic Party fighters raided Ansar al-Sham's headquarters and positions in the northern Latakia mountains and the countryside west of Jisr al-Shughur. Clashes took place and Ansar al-Sham commanders refused to fight, handing over their headquarters, which contained a large amount of weapons and ammunition, to HTS.

Unlike Hammerstein‚Äôs first roof garden theatre, which crowned his failed Olympia Theatre, the Paradise Roof Garden was able to rise to prominence and contend with its rivals for the better parts of two decades.Hoogstraten, Nicholas. Lost Broadway Theatres. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1997, 41-43. For New York City theatre-goers, the name Hammerstein‚Äôs grew to encompass both the Victoria and its roof garden.‚ÄúRialto Theatre to Close Tonight,‚Äù New York Times, 15 May 1935, 23. From 1904 to 1914 it was run by Willie Hammerstein, who put on highly popular vaudeville acts. Design The construction of the Victoria suffered from an anemic budget, and as a result, its roof garden developed incrementally. It opened in 1899 as the Venetian Terrace Roof Garden and featured a ‚Äú‚Äògrand promenade‚Äô in the style of Monte Carlo.‚Äù‚ÄúThe Roof Garden Season,‚Äù New York Times, 25 June 1899. The middle of its three tiers consisted of boxes; the third, an open-air caf√©. In compliance with the city‚Äôs building code, Hammerstein added eight exits and two elevators to his ‚Äúsolid steel and concrete construction‚Äù before summer season of 1902 commenced.‚ÄúFor Playgoing People,‚Äù New York Times, 25 May 1902. He also gained permission to install a roof that could open or close to accommodate the weather.Cullen, Frank. Vaudeville Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, Vol 1. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, 477. The bulk of the theatre rested over the Victoria, leaving the roof of the Belasco free for novelty features, including a pond, a Dutch-style dairy farm, and a windmill. The ‚ÄúMute Revue‚Äù consisted of garden displays that paid tribute to the theatrical hits of the closing season.‚ÄúHammerstein‚Äôs Roof Opens,‚Äù New York Times, 4 June 1907. Just in time for the opening of the summer season of 1907, the entire venue was upgraded: the house was repainted in white and blue with splashes of red, and the boxes were remodeled and decked with geraniums. Variety and vaudeville In addition to entertainment, the open-air Paradise Roof Garden offered patrons escape from the city‚Äôs oppressive summer heat.Cullen, Frank. Vaudeville Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, Vol 1. Abingdon: Routledge, 2007, 477. The table-and- chair seating configuration encouraged conversation in a house that was vulnerable to sunlight and outside noise; simple, wordless variety entertainment was well suited to such conditions.

The castle is a manor house and was fully restored between 2013 and 2014. Early years The first Gowran Castle was built in 1385 by James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond, close to the centre of the town of Gowran, Co. Kilkenny, Ireland. He made it his usual residence. James was called the Earl of Gowran. In 1391 he bought Kilkenny Castle and a large part of Co. Kilkenny. James died in Gowran Castle in 1405 and is buried in St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran together with his father James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond. his grand father James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond and his great great grandfather Edmund Butler, Earl of Carrick and 6th Chief Butler of Ireland. James the 2nd Earl was usually called The Noble Earl, being a great-grandson, through his mother, of King Edward I of England. Gowran had been a settled place and a place of importance long before the arrival of the Normans in Ireland in 1169 A.D. Kings of Ossory were often referred to as kings of Gowran. The Mac Giolla Padraig (Modern day family name Fitzpatrick), Chief Rulers of Ossory, had a residence in Gowran. O‚ÄôDonnchadha (Dunphy) was the chief of Gowran and most of the area around it. Local place names like Rathvaun, Rathcash, Rathcusack, and Rathgarvan, signified the presence of raths where people lived, farmed and foraged for a livelihood. Raths were also burial places. Larger sites were called Duns. The village of Dungarvan (Co. Kilkenny) also in the parish of Gowran is another example of such a settlement . The presence of the 3rd/4th Century Christianised Ogham stone on display in the historic St. Mary‚Äôs Collegiate Church Gowran would also indicate a place of residence and worship dating back 2000 years. There are other ancient sites close to Gowran. For example, nearby Tullaherin Church, graveyard and Round Tower dating to the 6th Century.

Agar Family Following the Cromwellian invasion in Ireland in 1650, Gowran was besieged by Oliver Cromwell. Gowran Castle was attacked and badly damaged.

Life and career  He took his first lessons from his father, the well-known painter Carl Joseph Begas, and began by doing portraits of his family. He was soon collaborating on works with his father and, at the age of thirteen, received his first commission. Later, at the Prussian Academy of Arts, he specialized in history painting. From 1849 to 1850, he studied at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts under Eduard Bendemann. He lived in Italy on a scholarship for two years, from 1852 to 1854. He returned to Berlin after his father's death, completing an unfinished series of portraits depicting Knights who had received the Pour le M√©rite. Afterwards, he received many of his own commissions from King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, producing portraits of Heinrich Friedrich Link, August B√∂ckh, Johannes von M√ºller and Johann Lukas Sch√∂nlein, among others. In 1866, he was named a Professor at the Academy, remaining in demand and exhibiting widely. Toward the end of his life, he concentrated on landscapes. Since his death, his style has come to be considered rather formulaic. He also did some decorative work, including lunettes in the Rotes Rathaus and small murals in the ballroom of the Kaisergallerie (a sort of early shopping mall) on Unter den Linden. Little of this remains, however. A detailed diary he kept from 1843 to 1848 has been of great use to cultural historians. The three-volume manuscript is in the collection of the Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlin. His brother Adalbert was also a painter. His brothers Karl and Reinhold were both sculptors.

The theatre was closely associated with the Paradise Roof Garden above it, and the two venues came to be known collectively as Hammerstein‚Äôs.‚ÄúRialto Theatre to Close Tonight,‚Äù New York Times, 15 May 1935, 23. Construction Undaunted by the failure of his massive Olympia Theatre, Hammerstein quickly secured the necessary funds to build the Victoria, purportedly named so in honor of his victory over his enemies. Due to budgetary constraints, the building crew was forced to take several cost-saving measures: the walls were filled with debris from the site‚Äôs demolished structure, Gilley Moore‚Äôs Market Stables; once erected, the plastered walls remained largely unadorned; and second-hand theatre seats lined the rows of the house.Hoogstraten, Nicholas. Lost Broadway Theatres. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1997, 41-43. Despite the shortcuts, the press warmly greeted the grand opening; The New York Times deemed the d√©cor ‚Äúwarm and comfortable,‚Äù free of anything ‚Äúgrotesque.‚Äù Legitimate theatre and vaudeville A three-act burletta titled The Reign of Error, featuring the comedy duo of the Rogers Brothers, christened the new stage and ran for at least fifty performances.‚ÄúNotes of the Week,‚Äù New York Times, 16 April 1899. In the four years that followed, Hammerstein presented ten other productions, one of which, a flop titled Sweet Music, was rumored to be of his own authorship. Not one of these productions, however, was successful enough to solidify a formidable reputation for the fledgling theatre. In 1904, Hammerstein's son Willie took over operations of the theatre, leaving Hammerstein more time to devote to his first love, grand opera. Willie took the drastic measure of turning the Victoria from legitimate theatre to vaudeville, and over the succeeding years, his risk proved tremendously profitable. Hammerstein‚Äôs bore the distinction of being one of the few vaudeville houses in the city to operate independently of the virtual monopoly that B. F. Keith and E. F. Albee enjoyed.Sobel, Bernard. A Pictorial History of Vaudeville. New York: Bonanza Books, 1961, 69. Headliners included such names as the Three Keatons, the Four Cohans, and the Seven Little Foys. In printed advertisements, the term ‚Äúdirect from Hammerstein‚Äôs‚Äù was testament to the quality of an act. Demise In 1915, Hammerstein sold the theatre to Samuel Roxy Rothafel; however, the transfer of ownership was not a seamless one. A colorful anecdote had Hammerstein wielding a hammer to drive away the wrecking crew. The Times documented, ‚ÄúIn Three Reels,‚Äù Hammerstein‚Äôs sordid legal struggle to gain access to his former office.‚ÄúOscar in Three Reels,‚Äù New York Times, 5 April 1916. Roxy wasted no time in gutting the building and demolishing the Seventh-Avenue fa√ßade; the Rialto Theatre, a movie palace, opened soon thereafter. Nineteen years later, the entire structure was razed and replaced with offices, shops, and a smaller theater.

It fought during the Syrian Civil War and was opposed to secular Syrian Kurdish groups, including those who want an independent Kurdish state. The group dissolved into Ahrar al-Sham by the end of 2014. History The group was established on 22 November 2013 by Salaheddin al-Kurdi and Abu Abdullah al- Kurdi, who was an Islamist activist from the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in the northwestern region of Syria's Aleppo Governorate bordering Turkey and at the time under YPG control. The group then joined the Islamic Front coalition, which included Ahrar al-Sham, Jaysh al-Islam and an assortment of other groups with an Islamist orientation. During the group's existence and membership in the Islamic Front it fought alongside other Syrian rebel groups against the Syrian government and the PYD's armed branch known as the People's Protection Units which is commonly referred to as YPG. Salaheddin al-Kurdi stated that the group's aims were to establish Islamic rule in Kurdish regions of Syria, that was to be led by Kurdish Muslims. Abu Abdullah al-Kurdi also stated that the group was established with support from Ahrar al-Sham as a counter-measure to YPG and to help diversify the Syrian opposition. The group also ran Islamic schools for Kurdish children in Aleppo. On 30 December 2013, the group's spokesman Salaheddin al-Kurdi said during an interview that Islamic rule would guarantee Kurdish rights and that defending Syria's Kurdish population was the primary goal of the group, adding regarding rival Kurdish groups in Syria that they were incapable of securing Kurdish interests. He also explained that the group has a presence across Kurdish populated areas of northern Syria spanning from al-Bab to Qamishli and Tell Abyad that had been taken from YPG. In December 2014, the Kurdish Islamic Front fully merged with Ahrar ash-Sham.

The first episode of the webseries debuted on March 2, 2014. The second season debuted on January 24, 2016. The series follows the lives of five single young women of African descent who have recently resettled in Accra, Ghana, after living abroad for most of their lives. The series also displays how each woman balance being a successful college-educated woman with their personal lives as well as their new life as \\"returnees\\" in Ghana. Each episode is told in first-person narrative through the main character NanaYaa and touches on a wide array of subjects from power outages or skin whitening to condom use, self-gratification and sexual abstinence before marriage.  History  Nicole Amarteifio, the creator and executive producer of the webseries, was inspired to create the series based upon her life as she was born in Ghana but raised abroad. Upon her official return to Ghana, she wanted to tell the story of women returning to the country, as well as help change the face of the African woman within mainstream society. Inspired by Issa Rae of the webseries Awkward Black Girl, Amarteifio made the series a webseries because she felt that her ideas would be changed and it wouldn't be the story she was trying to tell had she made it a television series. However, she based the series off of Sex and the City because she believed that Sex and the City gave American women confidence, and she wanted to do the same for women across the African continent.  Characters  * NanaYaa was born in Ghana and raised in the suburbs of New York City. After living alone in Manhattan following her family's return to Ghana, NanaYaa returned as a journalist and works as a talk show host at one of Ghana's top radio stations. While living in New York, NanaYaa previously dated Segun, a Nigerian-British man who moved to Accra shortly after their break up. Although the two are still in love with each other, NanaYaa begins to date Fidel Roberto, a wealthy Angolan man. Because NanaYaa is the main character, the series typically revolves around NanaYaa's struggle to make it in Ghana, as well as her imperfect love life. NanaYaa is portrayed by Ghanaian actress MaameYaa Boafo. *·π¢ad√© was born and raised in Houston, Texas, to a Nigerian pastor and his Ghanaian wife. A graduate of Harvard Business School, Sade returned to Ghana after living most of her professional life in Boston.

Sade is known for playing hard to get, as well as being promiscuous and for being spoiled by her many suitors. She is also very irreligious. Because of her promiscuous and liberal sexual attitude, Sade often clashes with Ngozi who is a devout Christian. Sade is portrayed by Ghanaian-American actress Nana Mensah. *Zainab was born in Sierra Leone and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. An entrepreneur, Zainab is known for being committed to her work which was what brought the young businesswoman to Ghana. She exports shea butter to the United States, as well as helping impoverished women in the Northern Region of Ghana. Because she is involved in her work, Zainab has little time for her love life although she has had several potential lovers through the series. Zainab is portrayed by Ghanaian-American actress Maame Adjei. *Makena was born in Kenya and raised in London, England. The daughter of an English father and a Ghanaian mother, Makena is a graduate from the University of Oxford's Faculty of Law.

Eccleston (1830-1911), pioneer, forty-niner, diarist who recorded the discovery of the Tucson Cutoff and Yosemite Valley.Robert Eccleston, Edited by George P. Hammond and Edward H. Howes, Overland to California on the Southwestern Trail 1849, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1950, pp.i-xii, pp.249-50 Eccleston was born in New York City, on March 4, 1830 one of ten children of Irish immigrants Edward Eccleston and Mary Anne Christie. In Spring of 1849, at the beginning of the California Gold Rush, Robert with his older brother Edward Eccleston joined the Fremont Association formed to travel to California and mine gold there. The Association traveled by sea to Texas and then purchased wagons for an overland journey with a U. S. Army expedition to establish a military road from San Antonio to El Paso. The Association then joined with John Coffee Hays and his experienced party of frontiersmen for the journey from El Paso to California. Robert kept a diary of this journey from April 3, 1849, when they sailed from New York, to December 27, 1849 when they reached the borders of California at Fort Yuma. In this book he records of how the Tucson Cutoff was found and first traveled by his party. Months later Eccleston's diary began again in the Southern placer mines at Agua Frio, on October 20, 1850. It describes life in the mines and his experience of the 1850-1851 Mariposa Indian War fought in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. In it he also recorded the discovery of the Yosemite Valley by one of the militia columns marching against the mountain tribes.Robert Eccleston, Edited by C. Gregory Crampton, The Mariposa Indian War 1850-1851, Diaries of Robert Eccleston: The California Gold Rush, Yosemite, and the High Sierra University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, 1957 On September 17, 1857, Robert Eccleston married Emily Josephine Young in Colusa and had their first child there. By 1861 they were in New York, where they had their second child. Returning to California after 1861 he settled down on a ranch to have several children in Forbestown, California. In 1870, Eccleston had taken his family back east to New Jersey where one of his children was born. Eccleston went to Arizona later in 1870, where for three years he was Indian Agent for the Gila Pima Reservation. One of his sons was born in Tucson in 1879, and another in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881. There Eccleston was considered one of the founders of Tombstone, and was there at the time of the \\"Gunfight at the OK Corral\\". In 1885, Eccleston moved to Oregon, where he lived until 1900, when he settled in Oakland, California. He died there on February 1, 1911. In 1950, his diary of his 1849 travels was published as Overland to California on the Southwestern Trail 1849. His account of his time in the goldfields and the Mariposa Indian War was published in 1957 as The Mariposa Indian War 1850-1851.

Featuring several new members among the group's ranks, the album was well received by critics, with Christianity Today and Rapzilla considering it the best album so far by the group.  Background  Tunnel Rats formed in Los Angeles in 1993 after group leader and founder Dax Reynosa held an open mike at his house. Committed to ministry and sharing the Gospel, the group eschewed joining a major, corporate record label, which could have suppressed its artistic and ministry potential, and preferred instead to take a more underground approach. Wade-O Radio explains that over the next few decades, the Tunnel Rats \\"expanded and contracted through nearly three 'generations',\\" and shifted from a heavy California focus to include artists from Boston, Texas, and New York City. The group released its first studio album, Experience, in 1996, through the independent label Brainstorm International. After some line-up changes, including the addition of members Sev Statik (also of Deepspace5) and brother-sister duo New Breed, Tunnel Rats released its second studio album, Tunnel Vision, in 2001 through the independent label Uprok Records. After this release, several more new members joined the group, including rapper-producer duo The Foundation (consisting of Dokument and Jermz) and Propaganda. Christianity Todays Andree Farias pointed out that the lineup additions that occurred since 2001 nearly doubled the collective's membership and expanded the collective's sound. In 2003, the group released a compilation entitled Underground Rise, Volume 1: Sunrise/Sunset in conjunction with Uprok, and followed in 2004 with its self-titled studio release. Farias found himself somewhat surprised that the Tunnel Rats' decided to release a self-titled release after over ten years of activity, especially since by the time of the release and recording of Tunnel Rats, Uprok Records had declined, overshadowed by its parent company BEC Recordings, and very little promotion was devoted to any of the remaining artists on the Uprok roster.  Style and lyrics  Cross Rhythms noted that the album features tracks \\"either written or collectively delivered\\" by Dokument, Macho, Jamie, Propaganda, Raphi, Zane, Dert, Griffin, Elsie, Theresa Jones, Sev Statik and New Breed. Lyrically, much of the album continued with the braggadocio that Tunnel Rats was known for, with Brenten Gilbert noting that \\"over half of the lyric sheets with reminders of who they are and what they've accomplished.\\" However, the group did address more serious topics, such as \\"Her Story\\", performed by female rappers Jamie, Elsie, and Zane, which tackles the issue of objectification of women. Andree Farias of Christianity Today described the album's overall sound as a combination of \\"cerebral hip-hop groups like Jurassic5 and MarsILL, plus the fun-based approach of L.A. Symphony and pre-Elephunk Black Eyed Peas.\\" He further noted that the expansion of the collective's membership since Tunnel Vision \\"rendered this new CD's scope and complexity more sonorous and menacing than their previous releases.\\" According to Farias, \\"We Just Roll Deep\\" combines \\"Timbaland-ish beats, Latin congas, and bassless, metallic kicks\\" with \\"Jigga-styled flows.\\" Both Farias and Gilbert considered the production more varied than on previous releases, as it features a more mainstream sound with occasional string sections, and sometimes draws from old school, underground, Latin, and synthpop influences. Critical reception Thomas McCalla of Cross Rhythms rated the album eight out of ten squares, stating that on this release the collective \\"bob, weave, duck and deliver a hard hitting release of personal testimonies and various life issues.\\" He highlighted the opening track \\"Born Again\\", which he called \\"a strong head bobber with an impulsive hook on the chorus\\", and said that \\"Sev Statik does it for me on his no compromise track 'Disposable'.\\" Andree Farias Christianity Today rated the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying of Tunnel Rats that \\"this heterogeneous crew features some of the most proficient wordsmiths and beatmakers in underground hip-hop today, faculties that shine copiously throughout the album's 20 rock-solid compositions.\\" He concluded that \\"This is the group's definite magnum opus, an effort where not only lyricism and scintillating rhythms collide, but where also faith and an unflinching heart for ministry resound with more clarity than ever before.\\" Farias also explained that producer Dert greatly matured since his debut, as with this album Dert took a more mainstream approach. \\"Never The Less\\" and \\"Planet Dok\\" Farias considered a departure from the Tunnel Rats norm, with \\"Dre-inspired rhythm tracks and Eminem-esque string sections.\\" He found the production by Raphi \\"slightly more underground in feel (Sev Statik's \\"Burn\\"), Latin-infused (the worshipful \\"Forever Yours\\"), or even Eurythmics-informed (the synthpop- ish \\"Point Taken\\").\\" Rapzilla's Brenten Gilbert rated the album three-point- five out of five, writing that despite numbering around fifteen members, the collective managed to balance its verses well, and new members Dokument and Griffin shone brightly both throughout the album and on their respective features \\"Planet Dok\\" and \\"My Name is Griffin\\". Like Farias, Gilbert found the production by Dert more mature, stating that he \\"managed to break out of the monotonous compositions from the previous Tunnel Rats efforts, solo and otherwise.\\" Gilbert concluded that Tunnel Rats \\"improved greatly since the release of 'Tunnel Vision' (most notably in the music) and they don't seem to have any notion of stopping any time soon.\\" Track listing References Category:2004 albums Category:Tunnel Rats (music group) albums ","title":"Tunnel Rats (album)"},{"id":"42767934","text":"The John Ash House, also known as Rowan House, Coker House and Rickles House, is a historic residence near Ashville, Alabama. John Ash emigrated from York County, South Carolina, first to Georgia, later settling in what is today St. Clair County, Alabama in 1817. Ash became a successful farmer, and served as a judge and member of the first Alabama State Senate. In 1821 Ash was one of five local leaders appointed to oversee the construction of a county courthouse and jail; the county seat was later named Ashville in his honor. Ash built a one-story dogtrot log house around 1820. In the 1830s, the house was extensively modified: three rooms and a second story were added to the house, and the exterior was covered with frame siding.

RPs can also be called ‚Äúclaims aware applications‚Äù and ‚Äúclaims-based applications‚Äù, and web applications and services can both be RPs. With a Security Token Service (STS), the RP redirects clients to an STS which authenticates the client and issues it a security token containing a set of claims about the client's identity, which it can present to the RP. Instead of the application authenticating the user directly, the RP can extract these claims from the token and use them for identity related tasks. The OpenID standard defines a situation whereby a cooperating site can act as an RP, allowing the user to log into multiple sites using one set of credentials. The user benefits from not having to share their login credentials with multiple sites, and the operators of the cooperating site avoid having to develop their own login mechanism. An application demonstrating the concept of relying party is software running on mobile devices, which can be used not only for granting user access to software applications, but also for secure building access, without the user having to enter their credentials each time.

MacFadden's parents were Rev. Robert A. MacFadden and Edith Hamilton MacFadden. His father died in 1909, leaving his mother to support herself and four children. In 1928, she became the first woman to file papers to run for governor of Massachusetts. MacFadden was a 1925 graduate of Harvard University. Soon after graduating, he became producer of the American Theatre Company, which presented plays for 10 weeks in the Boston area. The project was backed by Michael Strange, a writer who made her professional stage debut in the productions. He also served as director of the Community Arts Association in Santa Barbara, California, and the Theatre Guild School of Acting in New York. After starting out on Broadway in the 1920s, he moved into filmmaking in Hollywood. During the early 1930s he was a contract director at Fox. McFadden made a number of films for them including several early entries in the Charlie Chan series such as Charlie Chan Carries On (1931). He was released from his Fox contract following the 1934 merger with Twentieth Century Pictures. Thereafter he mixed occasional directing jobs with a number of small supporting appearances in films.

Her trial made national and global headlines. The case was noted as being very similar to that of the murder of Travis Alexander by Jodi Arias, with whom DeVault was in contact and whose murder trial occurred in the same courthouse one year earlier. Though she faced the possibility of a death penalty for her crime, DeVault was sentenced to life in prison. She is imprisoned within the Arizona Department of Corrections. Murder and investigation On January 14, 2009, DeVault entered the master bedroom that she and Harrell shared at their home in Gilbert, Arizona. She then struck Harrell several times in the head while he was sleeping. Harrell received multiple skull fractures and was taken to the hospital. DeVault initially claimed that Harrell was beaten by an unknown assailant who had broken into the home. She later confessed that she had beaten Harrell as an act of self-defense and alleged that Harrell was physically and sexually abusive. DeVault was arrested the same night on charges of aggravated assault and was held at a local jail, but was later released on bail. Officers noted that DeVault had reddened marks upon her neck and that they had found a hammer covered with blood at the crime scene. In early February 2009, DeVault was indicted for attempted murder and released on bond. On February 9, 2009, Harrell died of his wounds and a grand jury indicted DeVault for first-degree murder. At 3:00 a.m. the next morning, DeVault was assaulted by an unknown assailant as she was jogging, suffering a broken jaw and ankle. Following the beating, police investigated a man who lived with DeVault, Stanley Cook, Jr., and found dirty, bloody clothing. Both DeVault and Cook initially told police that Cook had killed Harrell. Cook had a brain injury that caused him to suffer from short-term memory loss‚Äî neither he nor DeVault could provide details concerning his involvement. Police found no evidence linking Cook to the crime; indeed, forensic evidence ruled out Cook having been the assailant. When confronted with this fact, DeVault confessed that she had bludgeoned her husband with the hammer. After Harrell was cremated at a Mesa mortuary, DeVault refused to give the remains to his parents, who then filed a civil suit against her for Harrell's remains and punitive damages. DeVault filed a 300-page confession with the Gilbert police where she detailed the years of alleged abuse, stating that Harrell had beaten and raped her on January 14, prompting her to assault him with the hammer. She also reported that Harrell had frequently sent her to the hospital and that he had once, in front of several witnesses, shoved her and dislocated her shoulder, which one of the witnesses helped pop back into place. During this time, police interviewed friends of DeVault and Harrell. The police found that they had no evidence to corroborate claims that Harrell had been abusive towards DeVault. They also mentioned that DeVault had lied to them in the past about receiving a large inheritance from the death of her stepfather, who was in fact not deceased. DeVault was also discovered to have lied about an older lover she was seeing, Allen Flores. She borrowed over $300,000 from Flores, who had been introduced to police as an ex-lover of her stepfather. Flores' house was searched twice, and the police located a computer with child pornography on it. Flores later agreed to testify on the Harrell murder in exchange for full immunity over the pornography charges. Trial DeVault was initially set to go to trial in 2011, but the trial was postponed. The prosecutors in the case sought the death penalty. Defense attorneys stated that DeVault had battered woman syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder, which they used to argue against the death penalty. Jury selection for the new trial began in January 2014, where Judge Roland Steinle commented that he did not want anyone on the jury that had been overly focused on the Jodi Arias trial. The trial for DeVault officially began on January 22, 2014, and was expected to run until April. In their opening statements, the defense and prosecutors posed different reasons as to DeVault's motivations for beating Harrell with a hammer. Prosecutors alleged that DeVault killed Harrell with the intention of collecting on a total of $1,250,000 from two life insurance policies so she could repay Allen Flores the $300,000 she had borrowed from him, while DeVault's defense attorneys claimed that DeVault acted in self- defense. The defense also stated that DeVault had experienced abuse as a child, and that her mother had physically abused her while her stepfather had sexually abused her. Dr. Jon Conte, a clinical psychologist that was also knowledgeable about the effects of child abuse, testified on behalf of the defense, stating that he believed that DeVault's actions were consistent with a long history of childhood abuse. One of DeVault's children also testified that she had witnessed Harrell abuse her mother. The prosecution countered this with testimony from clinical psychologist Dr. Janeen DeMarte, who diagnosed DeVault as having antisocial personality disorder. She also questioned why DeVault would give custody of her children to her mother and stepfather after DeVault had earlier claimed that they had abused her. The prosecution also pointed out that DeVault had initially claimed that an unknown assailant had broken into the home and assaulted Harrell before confessing that she was the perpetrator. On April 8, 2014, DeVault was found guilty of first-degree premeditated murder for the death of Harrell and the jury found that excessive cruelty had been used which made DeVault eligible for the death penalty. In a statement to the court DeVault apologized for the murder, saying that she was \\"sorry, not only for my actions, but for everyone I hurt\\" and also addressed Harrell's parents, stating that \\"My heart goes out to them...his mother and father have had to experience the worst loss in the world ‚Äì the loss of a child. I know there is nothing I can say that will ever ease their pain.\\" =Sentencing= The penalty phase of the trial commenced on April 15, and deliberations began on April 22. The jury sentenced DeVault to life in prison instead of the death penalty, and Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery stated that \\"imposing the death penalty in any circumstance is difficult and in this one the jurors apparently felt that a life sentence was appropriate\\". On June 6, 2014, the judge sentenced Devault to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Prior to the rise of fascism, communist parties had called for Soviet Republics to be implemented throughout the world, such as the Chinese Soviet Republic or William Z. Foster's book Toward Soviet America. However, after the rise of fascism, and the creation of the popular front governments in France and Spain, the Comintern under Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov began to advocate for a broad multi-class united front as opposed to the pure proletarian dictatorship of the Soviets. The possibility of a trans- class democracy was first put forward during the popular front period against fascism.  History  Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs was one of the first to suggest the possibility of Communists working for a democratic republic in his so-called Blum Thesis of 1929. Lukacs recounted in 1967: > It is hard for most people to imagine how paradoxical this sounded then. > Although the Sixth Congress of the Third International did mention this as a > possibility, it was generally thought to be historically impossible to take > such a retrograde step, as Hungary had already been a soviet republic in > 1919. Joseph Stalin, who had been in Soviet administration throughout the Russian Civil War and its aftermath, well remembered how the attempt to fight Bolshevik-style revolutions throughout Europe during and after World War I‚Äîthe revolutions of 1917‚Äì1923‚Äîhad mostly failed. Many Old Bolsheviks had thought at the time that these revolutions were the vanguard of the world revolution, but the latter never materialized. It was this very reality that had driven the development of the idea of socialism in one country as the Soviet Union's own path. With such historical lessons in mind, Stalin suggested to the leaders of Eastern European communist parties at the end of World War II that they should present themselves as advocates of a people's democracy. After the defeat of Nazi Germany and its allies in Eastern Europe, Marxist‚ÄìLeninist theoreticians first began expanding on the idea of a possible peaceful transition to socialism, given the presence of the Soviet Red Army. In most areas of Eastern Europe, the Communist Parties did not immediately take power directly but instead worked in Popular Coalitions with progressive parties. Unlike the Soviet Union, which was officially a one-party state, a majority of people's democracies of Eastern Europe were theoretically multi-party states. Many of the ruling Marxist‚ÄìLeninist parties no longer called themselves Communist in their official title as they had in the 1930s. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) for instance was ostensibly a union of the SPD and the Communist Party of Germany. Many of the other European states were ruled by Worker's or Socialist Parties. In the Eastern Bloc, People's democracy was a synonym for socialist state. Mao Zedong proposed a similar idea of a cross-class democracy in the 1940 essay On New Democracy. In 1949, he would make a speech on the people's democratic dictatorship. The people's democratic model would later be applied to socialist states in Asia, including China, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam. Ideology While people's democracies were considered a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, classes such as the peasantry, petite bourgeoisie and progressive bourgeoisie were allowed to participate. Nikita Khrushchev explicitly stated that the possibility of peaceful transition to people's democracy was predicated in the global strength of the USSR as a superpower. The Soviet Textbook A Dictionary of Scientific Communism defined people's democracy as follows: Trotskyists and other dissident anti-Stalinist Communists were against the idea of people's democracy which they saw as denying the Leninist insistence on the class essence of all state power.

He was described as \\"fighting to change how the West sees Arab youth ‚Äî and how Arab youth see themselves ‚Äî one superhero at a time.\\" Early life and education Bakhit was born in 1978, the son of Marouf al-Bakhit, who served twice as prime minister of Jordan. Bakhit said that, when he was a child, \\"I once had an art teacher who refunded my parents' money and advised me never to try again.\\" Suleiman studied at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. His original intention was to study mechanical engineering, but after \\"a couple years,\\" he reportedly \\"found it utterly intolerable.\\" Instead, he chose to pursue a master's degree in human resources development. His graduation thesis on this subject was \\"adopted by the Jordanian government.\\" He was at the University of Minnesota when 9/11 occurred. As president of the university's international student union, he began an \\"awareness campaign\\" to combat Anti-Arab racism in the United States. The campaign received considerable media attention and shortly afterwards, Bakhit has said, \\"four college kids attacked me on my way home late one night. They started with racial slurs, then attacked me with beer bottles. I suffered many scars and injuries that led to surgeries.\\" He decided, \\"Well, either I pack my bags and go home to Jordan, or I do something. And I decided the best way to fight racism is to start with the young. So I began talking to schoolchildren ages 6 and 7 about Middle Eastern culture and what happened to me on 9/11, spreading a very simple message: Not all Middle Easterners are terrorists, and Al Qaeda is like the KKK.\\" Eventually he \\"started realizing that mythology and stories have such great power to bridge cultural divides\\" and also \\"realized the power of empowering youth and women through positive role models in a medium they can relate to: comics.\\" In addition, he \\"realized that actually, no, there aren‚Äôt any Arab equivalents to Western superheroes. Yes, there‚Äôs Aladdin and Sinbad, but no one has ever done an animation or comic book based on the actual mythology from within the culture.\\" This recognition led Bakhit to do \\"a couple of years of hardcore research, reading ancient texts, doing six month's archaeological research in the Arab desert. I even learned Hebrew. I wanted to read Aramaic so I could read the Dead Sea Scrolls for inspiration. Meanwhile, I started to teach myself to draw, and came up with some characters based on my knowledge of Arab culture. It was a journey towards discovering my own culture more than anything else.\\" Over time, he has said, he became convinced that his calling was to create \\"characters and stories based in Arab tradition to spread the culture of tolerance.\\" Return to Jordan and Aranim Media Factory Consequently, he dropped out of the master's program in human resource development, returned to Jordan, and, in 2006, registered his company, Aranim. The name \\"comes from a combination of 'Arab' and 'anime.'\\" After returning to Jordan, Bakhit was physically attacked there, too, \\"this time,\\" he has said, \\"for being such‚Ä¶a voice for moderation.\\" According to his account, once he had \\"started publishing my comic books, especially the ones that fight extremism and terrorism, I got attacked outside of my office by a couple of extremists. One of them hit me with a razor blade in my face. He was trying to take out one of my eyes. Because it was late at night and I drive a motorbike, I had to cauterize my own wound with a pocketknife before getting to a hospital. That's how I ended up with a big, massive scar on my face.\\" Aranim Media Factory, based in Amman, has become one of the largest producers of comics in the Arab language, it produces comic books, TV and film cartoons, digital comic strips, manga, creative media, and social-media games. His goal is ‚Äúto entertain but more importantly to inspire Arab boys and girls to believe that real opportunities to be leaders are well within their grasp.‚Äù He describes himself as \\"dealing in hope and tolerance\\" and says that he wants \\"to build the Arab Disney.\\" He has said: \\"I go to a lot of poor areas and ask the kids, 'Who are your role models?' Sometimes they say Zarqawi and Bin Laden. But in one neighborhood I gave them comics and when I went back a few months later; the superheroes were now their role models. It doesn't even have to be real people they look up to. There's a huge lack of positive role models in the region. Superheroes are an aspiration for what we want to be.\\" Bakhit develops \\"the concepts, characters and stories\\" for his comic books, and has a team of writers and artists who translate his ideas into the final product. He also runs \\"focus groups to gauge what kids respond to.\\" He and his programmers, Jordanian natives, \\"learned from scratch how to program games. We bought books on Amazon and literally taught ourselves how to program, using blogs and online communities for support.\\" He has said that his firm is \\"the only Arab company in the entire Arab world that creates social games in-house at the quality that we do.\\" As an example of the fact that his stories \\"have deep Middle Eastern mythologies ingrained in them,\\" Bakhit has explained that \\"in ancient Arabic mythology, fire has seven types, each color corresponding to a different one. So I gave Naar ‚Äî which means 'fire' ‚Äî the first hero of my first comic, the power of the seven flames.

He received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862, when he picked up and carried his regiment's national colors after three other members of his regiment were killed or incapacitated by Confederate fire while attempting to secure the flag. Twombly also participated in a number of other engagements in the Civil War, including the Siege of Corinth and Sherman's March to the Sea. After being mustered out of service in 1865, Twombly attended business school and entered into a number of business ventures. In 1880, he entered politics upon being selected to be the treasurer of Van Buren County, Iowa. He served as the mayor of Keosauqua, Iowa from 1884 to early 1885, and as the treasurer of Iowa from 1885 to 1891. Early life Twombly was born to Samuel Twombly and Dorothy Twombly (nee Wilder) on February 21, 1842, near Farmington, Van Buren County, Iowa Territory. His father died in September 1842, leaving Twombly's mother responsible for raising him.Powell, p.310 While growing up, Twombly was educated at several common schools and at the Lane Academy of Keosauqua.Brigham, p. 1383. Civil War Twombly enlisted in the Union Army on April 24, 1861, after President Abraham Lincoln had called for soldiers to counter the secessionist Confederate States. On May 27, 1861, he was mustered into Company F of the 2nd Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a private in Keokuk, Iowa. The 2nd Iowa Regiment left for Northern Missouri on June 13, 1861, and was stationed at St. Joseph, Missouri to protect the city's railroad lines. On July 21, 1861, the 2nd Iowa regiment was transferred to Bird's Point, Missouri. The regiment would continue to be transferred throughout Missouri during the remainder of the year, but saw little combat.Dyer, p.1165 In October, Twombly was promoted to the rank of corporal and assigned to the color guard. In February 1862, the Second Iowa Infantry Regiment was incorporated into the Army of the Tennessee , which was under the command of Major General Ulysses S. Grant.Dyer, p. 479 National colors carried by Twombly during the Battle of Fort Donelson On February 15, 1862, the Army of the Tennessee attacked Fort Donelson in Tennessee. During the battle, Twombly picked up and carried his regiment's national colors after the color sergeant and two other corporals had been killed or injured by the enemy. Twombly was knocked to the ground by cannon fire, but managed to carry the flag for the duration of the battle. For his actions during the battle, Twombly was promoted to sergeant and later awarded the Medal of Honor in 1897.McKenney, p.91 His citation reads: Twombly carried his regiment's colors during the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh and participated in the Siege of Corinth, Mississippi as an acting second lieutenant. In October 1862, Twombly received a knee injury during the Second Battle of Corinth. He was hospitalized and placed on leave for six weeks to help him recover from the injury. In 1863, Twombly's regiment was formally stationed in Corinth, and engaged in numerous actions against the cavalry forces of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest. In October 1863, Major General William Tecumseh Sherman replaced Grant as the commander of the Army of the Tennessee. In November 1863, Twombly and the Army of the Tennessee marched northeast into Tennessee; his regiment spent the winter of 1863‚Äì64 in Pulaski, Tennessee. Twombly went on to participate in the Atlanta Campaign and Sherman's March to the Sea. He was promoted to first lieutenant in July 1864 and to captain in November 1864. While stationed in Savannah, Georgia in January 1865, Twombly was made the assistant inspector general of the Third Brigade of his division. In early 1865, Twombly and the Army of the Tennessee marched north through the Carolinas and fought Confederate forces in Columbia, South Carolina and Bentonville, North Carolina. Twombly reached Goldsboro, North Carolina by the end of March and was present at the surrender of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston near Raleigh, North Carolina. Following the surrender, the Army of the Tennessee headed north to Washington, D.C., where Twombly and the 2nd Iowa Infantry participated in the Grand Review of the Armies.

The window reads: \\"Tonight: Maureen Elderry and Tim Hennessy. Country [Illegible]!\\" The New Riverside Cafe was a coffeehouse and vegetarian restaurant located near the University of Minnesota in the West-Bank neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, from 1970 to 1997. It became a center for political and social movements around revolutionary politics. History The New Riverside Cafe was founded by the Episcopal priest William \\"Bill\\" Teska, with the intent of providing an independent center for the surrounding community, free from \\"establishment\\" meddling; Teska believed that government and corporate interests were trying to control the neighborhood's emerging post-1960s counterculture development. The cafe was created as a business, but within a short time it did away with the hierarchical business structure and opted for a collective style of management. As a result of this business model, starting in 1972, cafe revenue paid for all living expenses for members, including for members' rent and food. In the first few years of the cafe, the majority of members were housed in one of three collectively owned houses in the West-Bank neighborhood. In order to provide a supplemental income for the establishment, the New Riverside Cafe also had several side businesses such as a moving company, a vegetarian catering company, and an auto repair business. Political activism During the 1970s, the collective was heavily focused on social and political activism. In 1975 and 1976, the building that housed the cafe was set to be demolished to pave the way for development of the Cedar-Riverside apartment buildings. In reaction to this, the members of the collective occupied the building in order to fight its planned demolition. They went to court with the developers and eventually were allowed to stay when the owners sold the building. Success and eventual decline In the 1980s, the political activities of the cafe slowed while more emphasis was put on the economic viability of the collective. The cafe was remodeled in 1985, which led to an increase in customers and revenue. At the same time the collective sold vegetarian products to health food stores and cooperatives in the Twin Cities area. In the 1990s the New Riverside Cafe faced a number of debt problems from which it could not recover. Facing a debt of around $35,000, the cafe closed its doors in 1997.

The people of this tribe produced a large variety of highly developed art and music, such as harps, guitars, pots, and other crafts. Their pots are still prominent in today‚Äôs art spectrum, and ones that have been constructed in the early days of the tribe are sold to collectors and people alike for high prices. Background Their language is known as Kingbetu, which is part of the Central Sudanic language family. The people of the Mangbetu tribes are known today for their elongated heads, as per tradition, when a baby is born into the tribe their soft heads are wrapped tightly with a cloth to shape it into a long, protruding shape. This long-standing practice is still a custom today, as it is a sign of beauty in Mangbetu culture. Purpose The Mangbetu people constructed three types of pots: the Large Pot (also known as nembwo), the Small Pot, and sculpted/decorated pots. The nembwo is used to serve general purposes, such as getting water from the lake and carrying vegetables. The smaller pots were used for more specific tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and pouring. A few were used as toilets. The decorative pots were made more as a hobby, and nowadays used as collector‚Äôs items and can fetch a high price in art auctions. Shape The nembwo and Small Pot have a very rotund shape, not straying far from the conventional pot shape. More spherical than most due to how it is constructed, most are thin and smooth with a thicker opening. The more decorated and sculpted pots of the Mangbetu tribe have human or animal figures (mostly their heads) at the opening of the jar. Occasionally this sculpted figure is a Mangbetu women with the traditional. The handles of these pots are sometimes molded and shaped into animal or human parts. The bottom of the pot is round, and occasionally patterns will be carved onto the surface. Adornment and color Mangbetu pots are mostly mono-chromatic, made entirely with clay and fired in its natural form. As a result, most decorative pots are a dark gray color while the nembwo and Small Pots lean more towards russet. To serve as a decorative quality, patterns are often carved onto the surface of the pots in addition to the animal/human figures. Many times these patterns are very thin, long lines that cover most of the pot. More often than not, they are circular or wavy. Construction Mangbetu women and men make their pots and jars using relatively coarse-textured clay entirely by hand, either by building the clay up in rings or using a variation of the hammer-and-anvil technique. They mold the heads and figures on the openings and handles, while the patterns on the surface are carved using small tools, such as shell scrapers and wooden roulettes. After the pottery is formed, they are fired in open bonfires.

Timmerman and her 11-month-old daughter, Shannon, disappeared two days before Gabrion was set to stand trial on rape charges filed by Rachel the previous summer. Rachel's body was found in Oxford Lake, weighted down by cinder blocks. Shannon remains missing, but is presumed deceased. Gabrion is also the prime suspect in the disappearances and murders of several other people, including a witness who was set to testify against him in the trial for rape, his handyman, another potential witness and family friend and an unknown man. The bodies of these people, who were witnesses to his case, are yet to be found, but various items belonging to them were recovered from his home. The case received national attention both for the brutality of the crime and for the controversial sentence. Michigan abolished the death penalty in 1846, but the body of Timmerman was found within the Huron‚ÄìManistee National Forests, a federally-maintained forest, which is not within the legal jurisdiction of the State of Michigan, but is directly subject to U.S. federal law ‚Äì which does authorize the death penalty. Gabrion, who was tried in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, thus is the first person sentenced to death by a federal court located in a non-death penalty state since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988. Rape On August 7, 1996, Rachel Timmerman reported to Newaygo County Sheriff's department that she had been raped by Marvin Gabrion. The previous evening, she had been invited to a card game by a family friend named Wayne Davis and a classmate of Rachel's named Mikey Gabrion. Davis and Mikey Gabrion arrived to pick up Timmerman along with Gabrion's uncle Marvin. On the way to the card game, Marvin Gabrion allegedly forced Davis and Mikey Gabrion out of the car before driving off and raping Rachel. Gabrion was arrested and charged with the crime. Disappearances Victim Rachel Timmerman and her daughter Shannon Verhage On June 3, 1997, two days before Gabrion's trial on the charge of rape, Timmerman left the house with her 11-month-old daughter Shannon, telling her family she was going on a date with a man she met at work. Her father soon received a letter stating that she planned to leave town and elope. The prosecutor and the judge presiding over the case also received letters in Timmerman's handwriting stating that the rape allegations were fabricated and that she wished to drop the charges against Gabrion. Another letter arrived identifying the man she left with as being named \\"Delbert\\". Rachel's family believed the letters were legitimate and her disappearance was not investigated at the time. Investigation 1998 age progression of Shannon by the FBI On July 5, 1997, two fishermen found Rachel's body in Oxford Lake chained to cinder blocks and her face wrapped copiously with duct tape. According to the coroner, she was alive when she entered the lake and died from drowning. Gabrion's whereabouts were unknown, but he quickly became a prime suspect in her death. A search warrant was executed for his residence and keys that matched the padlock used to secure Rachel's body were found at Gabrion's home along with concrete blocks stained with the same paint as the ones retrieved from the lake. Marvin's nephew, Mikey Gabrion, also led police to a campsite that had frequently been used by his uncle. Gabrion's tent was found there, along with bolt cutters, chain, duct tape, a woman's hair clip, and nipples for a baby bottle. Gabrion's neighbors were also interviewed by police. They reported that Gabrion had a handyman named John Weeks, but that he hadn't been seen around the property in a few weeks. Investigators contacted Weeks' girlfriend, who identified a photo of Gabrion as a man introduced to her as \\"Lance\\". She reported that Lance had left the area with Weeks and she hadn't heard from him and was unsure of how to get hold of him. She also reported to police that on one occasion she caught John on the phone with a girl named Rachel. When she confronted him, she was told that he was trying to do a favor for Lance, who was interested in being set up with her. Authorities believe that Weeks was the mystery date who picked up Rachel and Shannon on the day they were last seen and that he arranged the date at the behest of Gabrion. The search for Gabrion lasted two months until they received a tip that Gabrion was set to receive a social security check from a post office in Sherman, New York. FBI agents covertly staked out the location and he was arrested as he left the post office. Timmerman's daughter, Shannon, has never been found. Other disappearances Gabrion is a suspect in the disappearances of several other people. The house where he was living when Rachel's body was found was owned by a man named Robert Allen. Allen was a mentally disabled transient and had been receiving social security when he went missing in 1995. Gabrion cashed Allen's checks and lived in his home until 1997. His impersonation of Allen led authorities to him following Rachel's murder when he opened a post office box in Allen's name and directed that his social security check be sent there. Gabrion was convicted of social security fraud in July 1998 for his use of Allen's checks and sentenced to five years in federal prison. Wayne Davis, the family friend who invited Timmerman the night she was raped, disappeared in February 1997. Davis was set to testify against Gabrion at the upcoming rape trial. Davis' residence was largely undisturbed when the disappearance was discovered aside from a stolen stereo system. It was later uncovered that Gabrion was in possession of the stereo equipment and attempted to pawn it. In July 2002, canoeists found Davis' body in Twinwood lake, another body of water in the same national park where Rachel's body was found. John Weeks' whereabouts are also unknown. Gabrion was the last known person to see him alive in June 1997. Weeks and Allen are presumed deceased. Gabrion remains the prime suspect in the disappearances of the three men, but has not been charged. Trial Gabrion was tried in 2002 for the murder of Rachel Timmerman. The prosecution presented testimony from multiple witnesses describing Gabrion's propensity for violence and threatening behaviors, including accusations of other physical and sexual assaults. Two witnesses testified that their homes had been set on fire following altercations with Gabrion. Another woman described how Gabrion trained a rifle on her and her two-year-old child as she walked to her car one day. He then climbed into his own car and followed them for several miles. The disappearances of the other men surrounding the case were also admitted. The trial was also noted for the judge's decision to deny the defendant's right to fire his counsel and defend himself in court due to Gabrion's erratic behavior and frequent disruption of court proceedings. He punched his defense attorney in the face in full view of the jury and he committed 40 major infractions while at the Calhoun County Jail. Gabrion filed numerous bizarre motions using \\"abusive and obscene language\\". He accused the judge of sleeping with and impregnating 13- and 14-year-old girls and called his lawyer and the judge \\"satanic\\" and \\"Hitler\\". During his appeal, the appellate court affirmed that the District Court had every reason to deny Gabrion's right to represent himself, noting that his erratic and disruptive behavior would certainly have continued if he were given the opportunity. The defense countered that Gabrion's temperament and actions were the result of multiple car accidents that had resulted in brain injuries as well as a troubled childhood. He was convicted and was sentenced to death. Death penalty debate United States v. Gabrion is considered a landmark case for its use of the death penalty in a non-death penalty state. Capital punishment has been abolished in Michigan since 1846. Michigan was the first English- speaking jurisdiction to eliminate the death penalty. Federal jurisdiction allowed prosecutors to seek the death penalty in the case. Rachel's body was found on federal land in Manistee National Forest, allowing prosecutors to try Gabrion in federal court and seek the death penalty on federal charges, a sentence that is not provided for under Michigan law. Gabrion was the first person in the United States to receive the death penalty for a crime committed in a non-death penalty state since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988 as well as the first person to be sentenced to death in the state of Michigan since 1937. During the trial, Gabrion's defense argued that she may have been killed outside Manistee National Forest before being transported into the park to be disposed of, and therefore the murder occurred on state property instead of federal property. The jury found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Gabrion killed Timmerman inside the national forest. In 2011, Gabrion appealed both the conviction and the sentence. The defense maintained that jurors should have been told that had Gabrion been tried in state court, he would not have faced the death penalty. In his appeal, Gabrion defense argued that under the Eighth Amendment and the Federal Death Penalty Act, Gabrion was entitled to argue to the jury during the penalty phase of his trial that they should consider any \\"residual doubt\\" that he killed Timmerman inside the national forest. The conviction was upheld, but the sentence overturned. In their decision, the court wrote, > The case was not brought to serve a special national interest like treason > or terrorism different from the normal state interest in punishing murder. > The jury should be given the opportunity to consider whether one or more of > them would choose a life sentence rather than the death penalty when the > same jury considering the same defendant's proper punishment for the same > crime but prosecuted in Michigan state court could not impose the death > penalty. In 2013, the sentence appeal was overturned and the death penalty was reinstated. Gabrion is currently on death row at United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute. Media coverage The case garnered national attention and was featured on the Investigation Discovery show FBI: Criminal Pursuit as well as Unsolved Mysteries. Rachel's father and uncle published a book about the case called The Color of Night: A Young Mother, and a Cold-Blooded Killer. The legal aspects of the death sentence in this case were described in the book Cause of Death: Forensic Files of a Medical Examiner as well as the law text book Psychiatry in Law.

With a building history dating to about 1780, and a continuous history of operation as a tavern, general store, post office, library, and town hall, it is one of the oldest establishments of its type in the United States. It is presently known as The Old Country Store, and includes museum displays on its history. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Old Country Store is located in the village center of Moultonborough, at the northwest corner of Whittier Highway (NH 25) and Holland Street (NH 109). The 2-1/2 story building is built out of rough-hewn timbers and sheathed in clapboards. Single-story porches shelter both street-facing facades. A shed- roofed ell, originally a stable, is attached to the south side, and a small 1-1/2 story gabled addition was added to the north side in 1870, and two additional wings were added in the 1950s. The oldest portion of the building, now an ell, was built c. 1780 by George Freese. Freese played a leading role in local politics, and it was during his ownership that town meetings began to be held here. David Bean, the next proprietor, also served as postmaster for the town. In the late 19th century an upstairs space housed the town library. The building ceased to house the post office in 1967.

A participant in a protest against Russian President Vladimir Putin that took place in Bolotnaya Square in Moscow on May 6, 2012, the day before Putin's third-term inauguration, Kosenko was charged with participating in ‚Äúmass riots‚Äù and with ‚Äúthreatening the life or health of a representative of authority.‚Äù Although Kosenko and his fellow defendants in the case, Artiom Saviolov and Vladimir Akimenkov, professed their innocence and were backed up by ample video evidence, they were found guilty, with Kosenko sentenced to forced psychiatric treatment. Kosenko's verdict and sentence were widely condemned as a political abuse of psychiatry, marking a return to the Soviet Union practice of sentencing dissidents to psychiatric hospitals, with one expert describing Kosenko's case as ‚Äúthe first such clear and obvious instance‚Äù of ‚Äúpunitive psychiatry‚Äù in Russia since Soviet times. Early life and education Kosenko was born on July 8, 1975. As a child, he reportedly ‚Äúloved to read, and always had his head in one history book or another.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou could say he was a nerd,‚Äù his aunt told The New Yorker in 2013, calling him ‚Äúa real humanist, without any aggression.‚Äù He ‚Äúcould have easily enrolled in the history program at Moscow State University,‚Äù according to his aunt, but instead went into the Russian Armed Forces, where he ‚Äúwas severely beaten by fellow cadets,‚Äù reportedly as part of ‚Äúa hazing ritual,‚Äù and sustained a concussion. The concussion left Kosenko with mild psychiatric problems. He was diagnosed with mild schizophrenia and declared a mental invalid. For over twelve years after his diagnosis, he received outpatient treatment at a psycho-neurological clinic. During this time, Kosenko, who has been described as ‚Äúa very shy person, shunning any kind of violence,‚Äù who has ‚Äúa long mustache and droopy eyes,‚Äù led ‚Äúa quiet, normal life, primarily staying inside the Moscow apartment he shared with his sister Ksenia (sometimes transliterated as Kseniya) and her adult son, where he listened to the radio and read books on Communist history. In late 2011 and early 2012, when a large-scale opposition movement broke out into the open in Moscow, it gave Kosenko a chance to take part in something, to be among like-minded people and express his political ideas.‚Äù Ksenia told the New Yorker that he viewed this development, which ‚Äútook him a while to digest,‚Äù as ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and ‚Äúinspiring.‚Äù Protest and arrest Kosenko was arrested at the Bolotnaya Square protest on May 6, 2012, released the next day, and fined five hundred rubles, which is approximately equivalent to fifteen or sixteen dollars. ‚ÄúMy son and I even laughed,‚Äù Ksenia later said, ‚Äúat how he got off so cheaply.‚Äù A month later, on June 8, 2012, a ‚Äúwhole crowd‚Äù of men walked into the Kosenko flat ‚Äúand announced that they had a search warrant. Four of them grabbed Mikhail. He was taken to Petrovka 38, the headquarters of the Moscow police force.‚Äù He was then taken to prison, where the doctors ‚Äúspent more time asking him about his political affiliations than about his medical background‚Äù and refused to give him the medication he had taken regularly for more than a decade, an antipsychotic/antidepressant called thioridazine. Consequently, he ‚Äúlooked terrible.‚Äù After his lawyers informed independent journalists about this situation, there was ‚Äúa small outcry‚Äù in the press, and Kosenko began receiving his medicine. Authorities argued that during a fight that took place between police and protesters during the protest, Kosenko had punched and kicked Alexander Kazmin, an officer of Russia's OMON (Special Purpose Mobile Unit) riot police. Kosenko, who had no police record prior to the Bolotnaya Square clash, was charged under Article 212, Section 2, and Article 318, Section 2, of the Russian Criminal Code. Ksenia Kosenko later told Amnesty International: ‚ÄúWhen some people started to fight with a police officer, [Mikhail] just stood there, trying to shield himself. He was taken to the police station and they took a photo of him. When a decision was taken to open a criminal case into mass riots at Bolotnaya Square, they started to compare their photos with the video footage. They had a photo, they found a video, and interpreted them in a certain way. That was it: the charges were ready.‚Äù Ksenia was not allowed to see her brother once during the two months following his arrest. Diagnosis During the trial investigation, the Serbsky State Scientific Center for Social and Forensic Psychiatry stated that it had diagnosed Kosenko as a paranoid schizophrenic who was ‚Äúdangerous for himself and others.‚Äù The Serbsky doctors made their diagnosis ‚Äúafter just one brief conversation.‚Äù The defense asked for a new evaluation, but the request was turned down. Kosenko's case was investigated separately from other cases stemming from the Bolotnaya Square incident because the investigators wanted him to be forcibly subjected to psychiatric treatment. Kosenko's diagnosis was widely criticized. Russian psychiatrist Andrey Bilzho called it ‚Äúthe death of psychiatry.‚Äù Yuri Savenko, a psychiatrist with 50 years of clinical experience who is head of Russia's Independent Psychiatric Association, called the Serbsky diagnosis ‚Äúoutrageous,‚Äù telling Kosenko's lawyers that the Serbsky doctors, in evaluating Kosenko, had overlooked 12 years of observations by Kosenko's own doctors, which made it clear that he was not aggressive or violent, that his medications were very mild, and that he had never required hospitalization. ‚ÄúPsychiatry is the most convenient way to save a case when it collapses,‚Äù stated Savenko, and called the diagnosis a signal that ‚Äúthe Soviet practice of punitive psychiatry was returning.‚Äù Kosenko's case went to court in October 2012. Kosenko testified that the fight that broke out on Bolotnaya Square had been incited by the riot police and that he had not beaten anyone. Defense witnesses confirmed his testimony. Oleg Orlov of Memorial, a human-rights group, was standing with Kosenko when the fight broke out, and testified that Kosenko had not taken part. Orlov said he was certain that Kosenko didn't commit the crimes of which he was accused. ‚ÄúIt's a political trial,‚Äù Orlov said, ‚Äúand Kosenko is a political prisoner who was unfairly convicted.‚Äù Alexander Podrabinek, a Soviet-era dissident who was working as a Radio France Internationale commentator at the time of the protest, ‚Äútestified that Kosenko stood next to him and did not brawl with police.‚Äù The defense presented a video which, according to public defender Dmitriy Borko, clearly showed that Kosenko had not participated in the struggle, and that he was about five meters away from the struggle. Although Kosenko was accused of causing Kazmin to have a concussion, the charges only indicated that Kosenko had struck Kazmin's body and arm. ‚ÄúThe evidence,‚Äù according to the New Yorker, ‚Äúbegan to look even more flimsy as the process wore on‚Äîin another criminal-justice system, it might have looked as if the case were falling apart.‚Äù Kazmin himself testified that he didn‚Äôt recall being struck by Kosenko, who, he said, had been ‚Äúsimply standing nearby.‚Äù Kazmin added: ‚ÄúEven if Kosenko himself inflicted injury, I don‚Äôt wish him harm‚Ä¶.I don‚Äôt want comrade Kosenko to sit in prison.‚Äù Only one witness for the prosecution, a police officer named Sergei Lukyanov, claimed to recognize Kosenko, although his testimony was reportedly ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù and he claimed only to have seen Kosenko ‚Äúmoving his arms toward Kazmin,‚Äù rather than actually doing anything violent. Lukyanov ‚Äúwas questioned in a closed session, with everyone else in court that day forced into the hallway.‚Äù On November 9, 2012, the Basmanny district court in Moscow ordered the extension of the pre-trial detention and other restrictions placed on Kosenko. The court rejected an appeal of this decision by the defense counsel, arguing that Kosenko's continued imprisonment was justified by the seriousness of the accusation against Kosenko and the danger of flight or continued criminal activity on the part of the defendant. On December 20, 2012, P.N. Gusev, Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper Moskovsky komsomolets; L.M. Alekseeva, Chair of the Moscow Helsinki Group and of the board of the Foundation for the Defense of Prisoners‚Äô Rights; L.A. Ponomarev, Executive Director of the All-Russian Movement for Human Rights; N.A. Tagankina, Executive Director of the Moscow Helsinki Group; and V.V. Yakov, Editor-in- Chief of the newspaper Novye Izvestiya, sent a letter to Olga Aleksandrovna Egorova, Chair of the Moscow City Court, asking that the court trying Kosenko ‚Äúbe allowed to make rulings strictly in accordance with the law, based on unconditional adherence to the code of criminal procedure, as well as the principles of humanity and fairness, giving priority to the human rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation.‚Äù Kosenko took part in the hearing by video-link from Butyrka prison. A Human Rights Watch representative was in court. The judge denied a petition for a new psychiatric evaluation of Kosenko. When permitted to speak in court, Kosenko did not address the specifics of his case but chose rather to comment on the larger picture. ‚ÄúOur people have become used to suffering,‚Äù he said, and criticized Russia's ‚ÄúEastern model of society,‚Äù in which ‚Äúa lack of freedom is exchanged for a comfortable life‚Äù and the people are subjected to the ‚Äúeternal tenure of a single regime.‚Äù Joshua Yaffa of the New Yorker wrote: ‚ÄúIf nothing else‚Äîas if it hadn‚Äôt been clear long before‚Äîthese were not the words of an unstable, dangerously clouded mind.‚Äù Kosenko, whose sister's letters to him were returned by the censors, learned of his mother's death through the media and was not allowed to attend her funeral in September 2013. Verdict Kosenko's verdict was pronounced on October 8, 2013, in Moscow's Zamoskvoretski District Court. It took Judge Lyudmila Moskalenko almost two hours to read her verdict. She found Kosenko guilty and ordered him sent to a psychiatric clinic. ‚ÄúThe court has come to the conclusion that at the time the action was committed by Kosenko...he was in a state of insanity,‚Äù Moskalenko told the court. When she finished reading the verdict, the audience shouted ‚Äúshame.‚Äù Outside the court, according to one source, ‚Äúdozens of people gathered in a peaceful protest‚Äù and shouted the word ‚Äúfreedom.‚Äù Another source reported that the crowd outside the courtroom ‚Äúchanted ‚ÄòMisha!‚Äô so loudly that Judge Lyudmila Moskalenko could barely be heard in the courtroom.‚Äù Opposition leader Alexey Navalny was in court for the reading of the verdict, and later said that Kosenko had behaved ‚Äúcalmly and courageously‚Äù and had set an ‚Äúexample for us all.‚Äù Reaction to verdict ‚ÄùThe most valued thing in the country is freedom,‚Äù Kosenko wrote after his verdict was handed down. Both the verdict and the sentence caused widespread outrage. ‚ÄúIt's definitely a revival of punitive medicine,‚Äù Olga Romanova, a journalist and human-rights activist, told CBS News. ‚ÄúAnd that's the most horrible thing of all. I think one can only envy those who will be sentenced to prison terms and not to treatment in a medical institution, a Russian medical institution.‚Äù Human-rights activist and Soviet-era dissident Alexander Podrabinek, author of a book about the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union, agreed: ‚ÄúThis is a clear case of a return to punitive psychiatry in Russia,\\" he said. ‚ÄúThis is the first such clear and obvious instance in the post-Soviet period.‚Äù The Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia issued a special statement about the case, stating that ‚ÄúOn the basis of a conversation that lasted less than one hour, the specialists made the far more serious diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia instead of the diagnosis of sluggish neurosis-like schizophrenia that Kosenko was treated for over the course of 12 years.‚Äù In the Russian periodical Snob, three Russian psychiatrists criticized Kosenko's sentence and rejected the prosecution's claim that he was dangerous. Writing in the Moscow Times under the headline ‚ÄúSoviet Psychiatry Returns,‚Äù Victor Davidoff described Kosenko's trial as ‚Äúright out of the Franz Kafka playbook.‚Äù Davidoff noted that the Serbsky diagnosis ‚Äúnot only contradicted the diagnosis of the psychiatrist who has treated Kosenko for many years, but also ignores his behavior in prison.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Russian authorities should end the injustice against Kosenko,‚Äù said Tanya Lokshina, Russia program director at Human Rights Watch. ‚ÄúKosenko should never have been forced to spend 16 months behind bars on grossly disproportionate charges, and now he faces indefinite, forced psychiatric treatment.‚Äù Amnesty International, which attended court hearings and determined that Kosenko's innocence had been ‚Äúoverwhelmingly‚Äù demonstrated by video footage and eyewitness testimony, declared Kosenko a prisoner of conscience and said that his sentence was ‚Äúan abhorrent return to the Soviet-era practices used to silence dissent‚Äù and that the system's treatment of Kosenko smacked of ‚Äúthe worst excesses of the now defunct Soviet era when dissidents were languishing in mental institutions, treated as mental patients only because they dared to speak their mind.‚Äù In an October 9, 2013, New Yorker article headlined ‚ÄúThe Insanity of Protesting against Putin,‚Äù Joshua Yaffa reported that the state was presenting the Bolotnaya Square case as a conspiracy that had been planned abroad, and that Kosenko was the first of twenty-eight people charged in the case to receive a verdict. ‚ÄúAt the very least,‚Äù wrote Yaffa, ‚Äúhis case sends a signal about the Kremlin‚Äôs rapaciousness not just in prosecuting the Bolotnaya defendants but in its desire to clamp down on all those in the opposition or sympathetic to it.‚Äù Noting that ‚ÄúKosenko was certainly not one of the leading figures of last year‚Äôs protest,‚Äù Raluca Besliu of the International Policy Digest stated that ‚ÄúThis means that no one is truly safe from the regime‚Äôs increasing ire. If he received such a terrifying sentence, what types of punishments can key opposition members expect from Putin‚Äôs Soviet-style crackdown? The less Russia‚Äôs general public reacts to these cruel punishments, the more leverage it grants to the Kremlin to intensify its oppression of the opposition. Only a few hundred people gathered to hear the verdict in Kosenko‚Äôs case. Have Russians become so indifferent to Putin‚Äôs behavior that not even the revival of Soviet punitive psychiatric mechanisms can motivate a revolt against an increasing repressive regime?‚Äù Amnesty reported on December 2, 2013, that Kosenko was ‚Äúnot receiving regularly the medication he needs.‚Äù Appeal and aftermath On March 25, 2014, the Moscow City Court upheld the verdict on appeal. Kosenko's sister Maria said afterwards that she and her brother had had ‚Äúa small thread of hope that maybe some sort of mercy and fairness was possible, but it turned out that it wasn't. This was just another charade of Russian justice, which doesn't in fact exist.‚Äù Kosenko's lawyers said they would file another appeal but added that they did not have much hope for a favorable verdict.

The screenplay concerns a group of medical students and locals in a small town who suffer an outbreak of a mutated H5N1-like virus that causes people to turn into zombies.  Plot  Professor Bergen, a famous medical researcher, discovers a vaccine to an H5N1-like viral pandemic. However, his research indicates that the virus has mutated and caused increased aggression in the local birds. While researching this phenomenon, he is attacked and killed by his test subjects, a flock of violent birds. After missing the funeral, Robert, a medical student, returns to his childhood home to settle his grandfather's affairs. He takes two friends along with him, fellow medical students Eugen and Patrick, who have an antagonistic relationship. When they arrive, Robert's ex-girlfriend, Marlene, confronts him and demands to know why he dumped her and left town. As Robert and Marlene talk, Eugen and Patrick flirt with Marlene's friend, Vanessa. Patrick invites the women to a party later that night despite Robert's protestations. Later, the trio are harassed in turn by Bollman, the town bully, and Lieutenant Lehmann, an unfriendly cop. When they finally arrive at Professor Bergen's mansion, they discover the place is in near ruins. Robert gives his friends free rein, and they raid the wine cellar. When the women arrive at the mansion, Robert and Marlene reconcile. Vanessa and Patrick continue their flirting, and leave the others to have sex. Eugen, drunk on absinthe and depressed, attempts to commit suicide, but Robert stops him. Bollman, who has been using roadkill in his local fast food delivery service, becomes infected with the mutated virus. Bollman develops large boils, becomes increasingly savage and animalistic, and goes on a violent rampage at Professor Bergen's mansion that culminates in his biting Patrick. Patrick immediately falls ill, and Eugen taunts him with grim medical diagnoses, such as amputation. Bollman, thought dead after the struggle, suddenly reappears and resumes his attacks. Robert is forced to shoot him dead with a pistol. Shaken, Robert volunteers to seek help, and Marlene joins him. Eugen and Vanessa burn Bollman's body and watch over Patrick, though Eugen secretly continues his taunts and threatens to kill Patrick. When Robert and Marlene see Lieutenant Lehmann murder and attempt to cannibalize a local, they retreat back to the mansion. Robert and Marlene, who is a biology student, use Professor Bergen's lab to analyze the virus. Robert urges Eugen to help, but Eugen dismisses their research as pointless and outright advocates killing Patrick. When the semiconscious Patrick saves them from a stray villager who has entered the mansion, the others refuse to kill him; instead, they bind him upstairs and continue their research. Eugen angrily leaves when Robert suggests that he, too, is infected, and Vanessa flees into the nearby woods. As Eugen is in the process of turning, he helps Vanessa defeat several infected villagers, but he turns hostile. In a moment of clarity, he commits suicide. Robert and Marlene flee to the top of the mansion, where they realize there's no escape but to jump. Robert survives the fall, but Marlene does not. As dawn breaks, soldiers storm the property, kill the infected townspeople, and take Robert in for testing. Convinced that Robert is uninfected, a rival scientist to Professor Bergen confidently asserts that they will have the situation under control soon, but Robert disputes that the virus can be stopped.

Mr. Coffee, which was first sold in 1972, soon became the dominant coffeemaker in the United States, reaching sales of approximately $150 million by the late 1970s. Abel's invention, the heating element, brewed a milder coffee than traditional methods, largely replaced the percolator in American homes. Home Furnishings News listed Mr. Coffee as one of the most important household consumer products introduced in the previous seventy-five years in a list published in 2002. Prior to his work on the coffeemaker, he held patents in film developing and aviation. Despite his role in the invention of the Mr. Coffee machine, Abel did not drink coffee. Biography =Early life= Abel was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 12, 1921, at the family home at 8111 Madison Avenue. to Edmund A. Abel, Sr., a laborer, and Rose Schoeffel Abel, a homemaker. Abel, who had two older sisters, was his parents' only son. He also had a younger sister. =Career= He became a student pilot and an amateur radio operator as a high school student. However, his interest in electrical and mechanical engineering began during his early teens while working for his uncle, Joe Schoeffel, who built homes for a living. Abel graduated from West High School on Franklin Avenue, Cleveland, in 1942. He was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly after his graduation at the height of World War II. Abel constructed early remote- controlled flying drones, which were used as target practice during the war. He was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia, and later landed at Cebu, Philippines, towards the end of the war. He was honorably discharged from the Army in 1945. He returned to Ohio following the war, where he studied aeronautical engineering at the AeroWays using the G.I. Bill. Abel, who held patents in aviation and film developing, worked for Westinghouse earlier in his career. Business partners Samuel Glazer and Vincent Marotta of North American Systems Inc., which was headquartered in Cleveland, originally conceived the basic idea for a consumer, automatic drip coffeemaker for home. Glazer and Marotta soon hired Abel and another former Westinghouse engineer, Erwin Schulze, to create the machine. Abel developed a new type of coffeemaker which used water heated to a lower temperature than traditional percolators. The new brewer also produced a more mellow, lighter taste than a percolator. The new machine, which was patented by Edmund Abel, came to be called Mr. Coffee. In addition to a less bitter flavor, Abel's heating element for Mr. Coffee could also brew coffee much faster than any, similar machines available at the time. Mr. Coffee could brew one cup of coffee in just 30 seconds and ten cups in just five minutes. Abel's heating element for the coffeemaker was unveiled at the National Housewares Show in Chicago in 1971. It went on sale in 1972 for $39.99, effectively revolutionizing the home brewing market. Beginning in 1973, sales were bolstered by TV advertising that featured New York Yankees baseball great Joe DiMaggio, who became the face of Mr. Coffee for over 20 years.NPR story on how DiMaggio became Mr. Coffee spokesman Abel received very little credit or attribution for his patented heating element for the coffeemaker. Though he held the patent for the heating element for Mr. Coffee, Abel assigned the patent to Mr. Coffee's manufacturer, North American Systems. The co-owner of North American Systems Inc., Vincent Marotta, often took full credit for the complete conception and design of Mr. Coffee in interviews, which reportedly annoyed Abel. Edmund Abel received very few royalties from his patented invention. Abel died from old age at his home in Rocky River, Ohio, at the age of 92. He credited his long lifespan with a natural diet supplemented with grapefruit seed extract.

It was released in October 2008. The game follows the story of the series where the player returns from jail and fights to protect and expand his gang's territory. The player can steal, carjack, mug, shoot, stab, and kill computer players. There are special minigames for robbing, stealing, and carjacking. Completing missions earns money to be spent towards replenished supplies and player upgrades. Reviewers contended that the game was too large for the small screen, which exacerbated difficult driving controls.  Gameplay  Screenshot of gameplay, with minimap in lower left corner and corpses in the street The game's story mimics that of the console game: the player-character returns to the city of Stilwater following a bid in prison and must restore the atrophied influence of their gang, the Saints. The player can kill, threaten, rob, carjack, and otherwise force other gangs out of Saints territory. For example, player objectives in the tutorial mission include hijacking a car, killing a policeman, driving to a \\"Forgive & Forget\\" location to lose the police pursuit, and mugging a pedestrian. Locations throughout the city help the player, such as fast food restaurants that restore health, gun stores for firepower, and spray paint shops to decoy the player when pursued by the police. An on-screen minimap displays nearby locations, and there is a larger citywide map on the pause screen that does not show detailed locations. The city is split into zones, and the game's mission objectives largely consist of driving to locations and shooting things. Mission examples include assassinations, bomb-planting, and robbery. The player can fight with a knife received early in the game and later with firearms that feature auto-aim. There are also sequences where the player can snipe enemies with a sniper rifle. Enemies do not hide due to a lack of a cover system. The player can earn money by finishing missions and robbing pedestrians, which can then be used to buy food, weaponry, spray paint, and accessories for the character's home. The mobile game features minigames for robbing pedestrians, stealing, and hijacking vehicles. While robbing, the player taps happy and angry face icons to terrorize the victim into giving more money. When stealing, a Tetris clone lets the player fit more items into the truck, and the carjacking minigame lets the player earn more money for scaring the captive passenger by driving at high speeds. When driving, control options include \\"directional steering\\" where \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" controls the vehicle in that direction (like a steering wheel) and \\"up\\" accelerates, and another option where the player presses a button corresponding to the desired direction. The player targets enemies by pressing the pound key and then pressing \\"5\\" repeatedly, which also leaves the character vulnerable. Players can run faster than the cars can drive.  Development  Saints Row 2 is a mobile tie-in action game modeled after the Saints Row 2 console game. It was developed by G5 Entertainment, where it was known as \\"Project Sienna\\" in development, and published by THQ Wireless on the Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) platform. The game was built on their proprietary Talisman engine, which G5 Senior Producer Mike Zakharov said in 2008 enabled the game to have a big environment with many things to do as \\"one of the most complex modern mobile games\\". As compared with its preceding mobile tie-in game (associated with the original Saints Row), the Saints Row 2 mobile game fixed issues of small sprites and too much traffic. Additionally, the developers changed the camera perspective from directly overhead to a slight angle. Saints Row 2 for mobile devices was first announced in June 2008 and released in October. It is compatible with the Nokia N95 and Nokia N81.  Reception  IGN's Levi Buchanan described the game as somewhere between a traditional tie-in game and a cash grab, and \\"ambitious\\" but limited by the confines of the mobile platform. He added the game appeared forced onto the platform despite its inability to support open world gameplay. Keith Andrew of Pocket Gamer felt similarly, and Rob Hearn of the same outlet also complained of how the large sprites restricted screen space and made driving slower. IGN's Buchanan felt that the screen was too small to fit so much action, especially due to the size of the minimap, and though the city \\"looks alive\\", it became \\"a painful obstacle course\\". He found driving difficult between its controls and his inability to plan for the offscreen unknown. Pocket Gamer Andrew also found both driving controls complicated and found himself accidentally killing pedestrians and thus getting into police chases. On the other hand, Andrew Podolsky of 1UP.com enjoyed driving through the destructible environments. IGN's Buchanan found the enemy artificial intelligence weak. Since no one takes cover, \\"they just stand there to be shot.\\" He added that the game was sufficiently long past the player's interest to continue, and that the game's sound was \\"unimpressive\\". 1UP.com's Podolsky called the game a \\"worthwhile download\\" and while noting that violent mobile games were rare, said the game looked \\"nearly identical\\" to the 2007 mobile tie-in game for American Gangster, though Saints Row was more violent. He added that the game's story was not interesting. Keith Andrew of Pocket Gamer wrote that the mobile game was \\"like ... no other\\" since the player could \\"watch life flow by\\" without providing input. He added that the game's primary task was staying alive since almost everyone other than the pedestrians and teammates are against the Saints. Andrew acknowledged the limitations of the top-down view on mobile and thought that the developers did the best job possible considering their platform's limitations, but asked, \\"Is a game like Saints Row really made for your mobile?\\"  Notes and references  ; Notes ; References Category:2008 video games Category:Action video games Category:Mobile games Category:Saints Row Category:THQ games Category:Java platform games Category:Video games developed in Sweden ","title":"Saints Row 2 (mobile)"},{"id":"42770592","text":"Leones De Alma Rosa FC Is a football team based in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

She participated in women‚Äôs organizations such as the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL). She also worked with other union organizations such as the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE) and the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Ethel Smith spent her life promoting the idea of equal compensation for equal work regardless of gender in order to protect the rights of the individual worker as well as society as a whole. Early life Born in Sangamon County, Illinois on 1 November 1877 to Richard Peter Smith and Marion Elizabeth Patterson, she was the oldest of three children.http://records.ancestry.com/ethel_marion_smith_records.ashx?pid=19220207 Smith‚Äôs father, Richard Smith, was a wage worker, moving from one job to another in order to make a living wage for himself and his family. His work ranged from farmer to teacher to deputy sheriff, he even ran a stable business for a short period of time.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 12. In 1895 Ethel Smith graduated from High School and went to work as a stenographer. In 1897 Smith went to Chicago to take a test in order to qualify her to become a stenographer at the Census Office. Subsequently, she worked at the Office of Chief Division of Manufactures in the 12th Census of the United States for about ten months earning about $600 a year. In 1901 Ethel Smith was transferred to the Bureau of Fisheries to work as a clerk and as a stenographer making $720 a year.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 13. After a few months Smith was promoted by the Civil Service Commission to be the private secretary to the Chief of the Division of Scientific Inquiry with a pay increase to $1000 a year, making Ethel Smith one of the highest paid women in civil service.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 14. During the summer of 1901 and the two summers following, Smith assisted the director of Scientific Inquiry as he worked in Woods Hole, Massachusetts as director of Commissions Laboratory.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 15. Smith also worked as a librarian for residence research workers during this time. In 1904 Ethel Smith assisted the editor of the Civil Service Commission publications in Washington D.C., a job she would eventually take over as editor in 1906 till 1914. By 1912 Smith had been passed over for promotion several times and received no increase in pay. Although she was earning $1600 a year it was still less than her predecessors.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 15. When she brought the issue up to her superiors she was told that they had no intention of promoting her or increasing her pay because of the belief that as a woman she could not be the primary bread winner.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 16. As a result, in 1912 Ethel Smith began to do volunteer work for the suffrage movement in the evenings. Activism In 1914 Smith resigned from her position as editor of the Civil Service Commission publications and took a paid position as secretary for the Congressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 17. Smith was appointed to her position after Alice Paul left the National American Woman Suffrage Association to start the National Woman's Party (NWP) leaving the position of chairwoman of the Congressional Committee open to Ruth McCormick who then appointed Ethel Smith as Secretary. Smith worked as a state organizer for the Committee as well as tracked suffrage votes and reported the activities of other suffrage organizations. Then in April 1917 Smith was appointed as Director of the National American Woman Suffrage Association‚Äôs Industrial Committee and their Publicity Bureau.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 18. Within the Industrial Committee Smith worked to safeguard the industrial standards during World War I and organized a ‚Äúsystematic propaganda campaign against excessive overtime and underpay in industries where women are employed.‚ÄùButler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 18. Smith began to push the suffrage movement to extend their organizational experiences and interests to include other areas that were in need of legislative change, such as women‚Äôs labor.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 19. She began to call for reforms saying that work performed rather than gender should determine the wage. The National American Woman Suffrage Association disagreed, however. The President, Carrie Catt, wrote Smith that although they supported Smith they were worried she had lost sight of the goal to obtain the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and it was best to focus their primary efforts on that issue. Smith continued to work for the National American Woman Suffrage Association and continued to be devoted to the suffrage cause. She also began ‚Äúto join forces with labor unions and organizations that promoted collective action to educate and unite working men and women.‚ÄùButler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 20. In November 1917 Smith became active in the National Federation of Federal Employees which engaged in a range of actives to establish modern standards of wage and working conditions in the civil services.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 20. Smith became a member of their Legislative Committee to further education on social and economic welfare for Federal employees. Then in 1918 Ethel Smith was offered two paid positions in the Women's Trade Union League as the Executive Secretary of its Washington Committee and the Resident Secretary for its National Legislative Committee.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 23. While on the Legislative Committee Smith began to be recognized as an effective lobbyists for minimum wage laws, the creation of the Women‚Äôs Bureau in the Department of Labor, and the eight-hour work day. The Washington Committee allowed her to educate working women on the power of unions and to create several unions between 1918-1920 including unions for women cigar makers and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 25. Also in 1918, The Central Labor Union of Washington, D.C. selected her to serve as a labor representative on the local minimum wage board which became crucial to creating the Kesting-Tramell Minimum Wage Law. Smith continued to be very active in both labor organizations and women‚Äôs organizations but her hard work took its toll on her health and in late 1920 Ethel Smith collapsed due to extreme exhaustion.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 31. Smith spent the next several months recuperating but when she finally got back on her feet she continued to be very active. In the 1920s she joined the newly formed group called Women‚Äôs Bureau.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 79. Women‚Äôs Bureau worked to ‚Äúformulate standards and policies which shall promote the welfare of wage earning women‚Ä¶ and advance their opportunities for profitable employment.‚ÄùButler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 79. Smith worked closely with the Women‚Äôs Bureau in the campaign to enforce the merit system and pay equality for women in the federal civil service. For the next few years Ethel Smith worked for the passing of a minimum wage law for women and children in Washington, D.C. and the Child Labor Amendment. However, eventually both failed.Butler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M. Smith, (Albany, State University Press), 88. Smith ‚Äúcontinued to struggle within the conservative political climate but her attempts to represent the diversity of women‚Äôs interests through legislative means were increasingly defeated.‚ÄùButler, Amy E, Two Paths to Equality: Alice Paul and Ethel M.

Wilder escaped from prison three times in the 1960s, and his escapades captured the attention of the public. First escape Wilder was in New Plymouth Prison on 17 May 1962. Part way through a four-year sentence for shopbreaking and theft related to his favourite Jaguar cars, he scaled the high wall that day and was not recaptured until 21 July. During those 65 days, he captured the attention of the New Zealand public when newspapers began reporting several hair-raising escapes from the dozens of police tasked with his capture. The stories of Wilder's escapades, included \\"wild drives through police barricades, evading large search parties, escaping a police dog by swimming across a river, and getaways by dinghy and horse - all with no hint of violence\\". At one stage he is reported to have even joined in a shoulder to shoulder search through rough country for himself, slipping away from his pursuers when the opportunity arose. These exploits seemed to have caught something in the public imagination and Mr Wilder was to a large extent cheered on by large sections of the New Zealand public. Finally, he was sighted on 21 July near Whakamaru. A large force of police and soldiers, including three dogs, was mobilised to catch him. Constable Hamilton saw Wilder break from cover and gave chase, but Wilder dashed down a steep bank and disappeared from view. He was found a few hours later, hiding in a hole by a logging road, and taken back to jail. Second escape Wilder escaped again six months later on 29 January 1963, this time from Mount Eden Prisons in the heart of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city. He escaped with three other prisoners by making a rope of sheets and scaling the wall with it. This time, he managed to avoid recapture for 172 days. It was during this period that his folk hero status was firmly established. Wilder would often break into holiday homes or premises and leave apology and thank you notes for the owners. People began leaving food out for him. A popular musical group, the Howard Morrison Quartet, penned a hit single called \\"George, the Wild(er) New Zealand Boy\\" about him, which, despite being banned by New Zealand's state owned broadcasters, went immediately to number 1 in the charts and stayed there for some ten weeks. Eventually, after evading police for 172 days, George Wilder was captured again on 17 July 1963 in a hut at Rununga Bush, off the Napier-Taupo highway. During the time he was at large, he travelled and allegedly committed 40 crimes. Third escape Restored to life in prison, George Wilder made one more attempt at freedom but this, his final escape, was short lived. In 1965 he escaped with two other prisoners, armed with a sawn-off shotgun. They kidnapped a prison warder at gunpoint and holed up in a house in Mount Eden. After three hours, the trio surrendered to the Armed Offenders Squad and Wilder went back into custody, where he remained until he was paroled in 1969. However, he got into trouble for allegedly stealing rifles and escaped by rowing across the Firth of Thames. He was eventually captured and returned to prison to serve out the remainder of his sentence, which had been extended by his escapes. On 20 June 1969, George Wilder was finally released from prison and moved to the Wairarapa coast, where he still lives as of 2019.

It replaced the earlier, bonneted Dodge 100 (nicknamed \\"Parrot-Nose\\") truck and was itself replaced by the Ghia-designed Dodge 500 which appeared in late 1964. Following the retirement of the 300, Dodge's Kew plant was shuttered as production was moved to Dunstable.

Most Dodge 300s received diesel engines from Perkins. The Motor Panels cab design used was shared with Leyland and Albion. It is therefore often referred to as the \\"LAD\\" cab (Leyland-Albion-Dodge). Bus Models A bus variant of the Dodge 300 was developed in the early 1960s, but only eight were built. A prototype model S306 with a Leyland engine and Weymann bus body was built in 1962 (registered 2498PK), followed by a model S307 with Perkins engine and Marshall bus body in 1964 (registered 3033PE). These were used as demonstrators by Dodge, but the only orders which resulted were for six S307 models with Strachans coach bodies which were delivered to Rickards of Brentford later in 1964 (registered AYV93B to AYV98B). 1972-1982 models From 1972 on, a new Dodge 300 series of heavy lorries was sold in the UK. These were made in Spain by Chrysler Spanish subsidiary, and included a 38-tonne tractor and four, six and eighth- wheelers rigids. Sales took off well, and the model was not dropped until 1982, well after Renault V√©hicules Industriels took control of Chrysler Europe truck operations.

This species is known from sandy substrates in shallow seas in southeastern and southwestern Australia. This species was the first member of the family to be discovered alive; previous to its discovery, trigoniids were only known from fossils. History Jean-Baptiste Lamarck first described Neotrigonia margaritacea (under the name Trigonia margaritacea) in 1804. It was what is now known as a \\"living fossil\\", being the first known living member of the Trigoniidae, a family of bivalve mollusks that was well known from fossils, but that had been thought to have become extinct not long after the end of the Mesozoic Era. In 1912, Cossman renamed the genus Neotrigonia, and this genus now contains several other species discovered subsequently, all from the waters around Australia and Tasmania. Description 1901 illustration of a shell of what was then known as Trigonia margaritacea, in the British Museum The shell of Neotrigonia margaritacea is thick and heavy for its size. The typical width of the adult shell is . In the living animal, the interior of the valves is nacreous and tinged pink. This colour can eventually be lost in empty shells, though a metallic lustre does persist. This clam is capable of opening its shell quite widely; the valves are kept properly aligned and articulated by a series of massive and smaller teeth on the hinge line. The animal does not have siphons. It respires using filibranch gills. The foot is basically L-shaped, large and muscular, with an additional heel-like lobe. Ecology Neotrigonia margaritacea is a suspension feeder which lives in sand. It is able to move about and can use its foot to jump.

L. Balakrishnan, was an Indian film still photographer and actor who worked in Malayalam cinema. He worked as a still photographer in about 170 films and has associated with great directors including G. Aravindan, John Abraham, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, P. Padmarajan, Bharathan and K. G. George. He was an actor, with 180 credits to his name, and has also worked as a photo journalist with Kerala Kaumudi. Biography =Early life= N. L. Balakrishnan hailed from Powdikonam near Chempazhanthy in Thiruvananthapuram. He was born as the only child of Narayanan and Lakshmi on April 17, 1942. He obtained a diploma in painting from College of Fine Arts Trivandrum and trained in photography from various studios in Trivandrum including Metro Studio, Sivan Studio and Rupalekha Studio. K. Neelakanta Pillai of Rupalekha Studio introduced Balakrishnan to film producer Sobhana Parameswaran Nair who made him work as a still photographer in the super hit film Kallichellamma (1967). =Photography= Balakrishnan is best known for his work as unit still photographer in the films of master director G. Aravindan. He worked with Aravindan in 11 films including Kanchana Sita, Pokkuveyil, Chidambaram and Vasthuhara. Balakrishnan worked with Adoor Gopalakrishnan in five films: Prathisandhi (documentary film conceived for UNICEF), Swayamvaram, Kodiyettam, Mukhamukham and Elippathayam.

He was the first to take still pictures while the film was being shot. The practice till then was to pose after the scenes were shot by the movie camera. Veteran photographer R. Gopalakrishnan says: \\"He [Balakrishnan] was also the first one to take a picture without using the flash, and that made his stills natural. He also showed that better pictures could be taken using the 35mm camera, instead of the 120mm, which had been in vogue earlier.\\" According to noted film critic C. S. Venkiteswaran, Balakrishnan was much more than a photographer; he was a \\"historian in a photographer‚Äôs garb.\\" Venkiteswaran says: \\"He [Balakrishnan] travelled with the most important filmmakers of Malayalam, captured their moods, the moments during the making of films and also the cultural and social ambience of the periods in which these films were made.\\" =Acting= Balakrishnan's first film was Rajiv Anchal's Ammanam Kili. Anchal says, \\"I had known him since the days of working with Aravindan for Oridath.

It was formed in 1957 and finally deactivated in 1991. It draws its history from the 1st Rifle Corps, formed in 1922. Troops of the 1st Rifle Corps participated in the Winter War (November 1939 - March 1940) and World War II.  First Formation  The corps was formed in June, 1922 in Petrograd (currently Saint- Petersburg) as the 1st Army Corps (1 ak). Creation of the corps was based on a Directive of the Commander number 195060/69, of 15 May 1922, Order Petrograd VO No.1416/383, 6 June 1922. In July 1922 it was named the 1st Rifle Corps. In 1926 corps headquarters was moved to Novgorod, and in 1938 to Pskov. On May 15, 1939, the 75th Rifle Division (75th RD) was transferred from the 14th Rifle Corps (Kharkov Military District) and arrived in the Leningrad Military District. In September 1939, the 75th Rifle Division concentrated in the 1st Rifle Corps 8th Army on the border with Estonia. In November 1939 the 75th Rifle Division arrived in Schlusselburg (LenVO) where on vehicles it was transferred to Karelia, as part of the 1st Rifle Corps, 8th Army, LenVO. That same month corps headquarters was moved to Petrozavodsk (November 1939 - April 1940). Corps Headquarters was located at: * Pskov (April - June 1940); * Tartu (June - July 1940); * Bia≈Çystok ( from July 1940). The corps was a part of the: * Petrograd Military District (1922-1924); * Leningrad Military District (1924-1939); * 8th Army Leningrad Military District (November 1939 - July 1940 ); * 10th Army Western Special Military District (July 1940). The corps participated in the Soviet-Finnish War (1939-1940) (November 1939 - March 1940). On June 22, 1941, at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the corps comprised the:compounds of ground troops to the Western Front, June 22, 1941 * Corps Headquarters (Bialystok) Location parts of the Western Special Military District at 30.05.1941 *2nd Rifle Division (Osovets) * 8th Rifle Division (Stavisky) * 130th Corps Artillery Regiment (≈Åom≈ºa) * 262nd Corps Artillery Regiment * 23rd Separate Communications Battalion General Major F.D. Rubtsov was the corps commander. Last mention in the Boevoi sostav Sovetskoi armii (Combat composition of the Soviet Army, BSSA) was on 1 July 1941 with the corps directly subordinated to the Western Front (Soviet Union).  Second formation  The corps reappeared in BSSA on 1 June 1942 directly subordinated to the North Caucasian Front, and made up of four rifle brigades. Thereafter, the last 1942 BSSA mention of the corps is on 1 August 1942.  Third formation and Cold War  The 1st Rifle Corps reappears in the BSSA on 1 September 1943 as part of the Northwestern Front.

The return occurred late in the fourth quarter and provided the only touchdown scored in the game, as the Tigers won 7‚Äì3. Featuring several broken tackles, it was a signature play of Cannon's Heisman Trophy-winning season and a notable moment in the LSU‚ÄìOle Miss football rivalry. Background LSU and Ole Miss had played each other regularly since 1894, and considered each other arch-rivals. Both teams were undefeated on the season coming into the game. The Tigers were the top-ranked team in the Associated Press poll and the Rebels were ranked third. Each had star players playing in their senior years: Billy Cannon for LSU and Charlie Flowers for Ole Miss. Both teams' defenses were among the best in the nation; LSU had surrendered six points combined in their first six games, while Ole Miss gave up seven points and shut-out five of the six teams they played to that point. The game was highly anticipated, with sportswriters calling it \\"the game of the year.\\" One man offered to swap 50-yard line Sugar Bowl tickets for tickets anywhere in Tiger Stadium for LSU vs. Ole Miss. Another man, perhaps jokingly, offered up his wife for tickets. One enthusiastic propagandist from the South proclaimed Ole Miss would \\"make LSU's Chinese Bandits look like geisha girls\\". On October 30, the night before the game, hundreds of LSU students surrounded the practice field where the Rebels were running drills, and taunted them with shouts of \\"Go to Hell, Ole Miss!\\" The game Tiger Stadium was filled to capacity with 68,000 fans packing the stands. As expected, the game was a defensive struggle. The Rebels scored a field goal in the first quarter, and spent the rest of the game relying on defense and trying to pin the Tigers deep in their own territory. They punted on early downs and gambled on LSU making mistakes on offense. The gambles paid off, as the Tigers fumbled four times in the game. An interception by Cannon early in the fourth quarter caused Ole Miss coach Johnny Vaught to abandon the offensive game completely. He had his quarterback and punter, Jake Gibbs, punt on first downs. \\"They kept punting the ball, sticking us back in a hole,\\" Cannon recalled, \\"and I thought, 'If I can get my hands on this one, I'm going to take it back.'\\" =\\"The run\\"= With LSU still trailing 3‚Äì0 late in the fourth quarter, on fourth-and-17 from the Ole Miss 42 yard line, Gibbs punted the ball 47 yards to the LSU 11-yard line. He intended to kick it out of bounds, as instructed by Vaught. Cannon picked up the ball after a bounce, defying coach Paul Dietzel's orders not to field punts that close to the end zone. Dietzel described his reaction to Cannon fielding the punt as \\"'Billy, no-no-no...' to 'Billy, go-go-go!'\\" He eluded and bounced off seven would-be tacklers down the east sideline, then raced the last 60 yards untouched to the end zone to give LSU a 7‚Äì3 lead. Cannon gave his account of the run in his 2015 biography: > \\"After I caught the ball, the first person looking me in the eye was Larry > Grantham. I knew how good he was. I wanted to go to the left toward the open > field, but there he was, so I cut back to the right, and he missed the > tackle. I started down field, following the sideline, picking up a few > blocks, and some guys missed their tackles. Finally, I broke into the open, > and there was nobody left but me and Jake Gibbs. Gibbs thought I was going > to the wide side of the field, so I gave him a little head fake. Now I've > got to give Jake credit on this: That was the only tackle he had missed in > his entire career to that point. Of course, with the team he had around him, > that was the only tackle he tried to make in four years. After I had the > clear sailing to the goal line, it was a question of was I going to make it, > was the referee going to beat me there, or was the cameraman gaining on both > of us going to outrun the whole bunch.\\" After the touchdown, LSU kicked off to Ole Miss, which then drove down the field to the LSU 5-yard line. After three plays Ole Miss was at the LSU 1-yard line. On fourth down and the final play of the game, LSU defensive back Warren Rabb, with an assist from Cannon, tackled Ole Miss' Doug Elmore short of the goal line as time expired to preserve the 7‚Äì3 LSU victory. Aftermath Cannon's performance in the game was a main factor in his winning the Heisman Trophy at the end of the season. Cannon himself said, \\"The thing that clinched the Heisman for me was that I made a play or two in a big game.\\" A video of the punt return is still played on the big screen in Tiger Stadium before every home game. The teams met again at the end of the season in the 1960 Sugar Bowl. Ole Miss dominated for most of the game, as they held LSU to just 74 yards of total offense and won 21‚Äì0. The Rebels were named national champions by various selection committees. Over each of the next three seasons, the LSU vs. Ole Miss game was played with both teams ranked in the top ten and in contention for the national title. In 1960, the teams played to a 6‚Äì6 tie, which was the Rebels' only blemish in a 9‚Äì0‚Äì1 national championship season. The next season, sixth-ranked LSU defeated second-ranked and undefeated Ole Miss in Tiger Stadium, 10‚Äì7. In 1962, both teams were undefeated and ranked in the top five when the Rebels defeated the Tigers in Baton Rouge. Ole Miss finished the season undefeated and was again named national champion. On Halloween night in 1979, exactly twenty years after Cannon's run, his son, Billy Cannon Jr. returned a punt for Broadmoor High School 89 yards for a touchdown. The return came against Istrouma High School, his father's alma mater. Cannon Jr. later played for Texas A&M; and was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round of the 1984 NFL Draft.

Stock educated Charles Pritchard (1808‚Äì1893), from 1822. Pritchard, a future astronomer, used some old instruments at the school constructed by James Ferguson. He went on to become Headmaster of Stockwell Grammar School. In 1814 he had his portrait painted by Henry William Pickersgill. In 1821 and 1823, he and fellow parishioner, George Green, provided two tranches of loans towards the building of All Saints, Poplar, a new church being built in the parish.. However this supplanted a year or so later by a loan on better terms from the West India Dock Company. In 1833 he gave evidence to the House of Commons select committee on Public Walks raising concerns about the lack of public space for the \\"humbler class of Londoner\\"\\" and that this was contributing to such people frequenting public houses. He was a visiting justice to the Hanwell Asylum. He served as a magistrate for Middlesex and was buried in the graveyard of St Matthias Old Church, Poplar.

Republican Kim Wyman was elected Secretary of State to succeed incumbent Republican Sam Reed, who did not seek re-election. Primary election The primary election took place in August. Under Washington's top-two primary system, introduced in the early 2000s, the primary was designed to narrow the field of candidates to two, rather than select specific party nominees, and candidates could designate themselves as affiliated with any political party, whether it existed or not. Seven candidates contested the primary: * Thurston County Auditor Kim Wyman ran under the Republican Party designation. * Karen Murray ran under the Constitution Party designation. * Sam Wright ran under the Human Rights Party designation. * David J. Anderson ran as an independent candidate. * Former Seattle mayor Greg Nickels, state senator Jim Kastama, and former state legislator Kathleen Drew, all ran under the Democratic Party designation. Wyman and Drew scored the most votes in the primary contest, thereby becoming the two candidates to advance to the general election. Wyman received 39.75-percent of the vote and Drew 21.73-percent. General election Republican Kim Wyman won the general election in a close-fought contest, and was the only Republican elected to statewide office in Washington. She was endorsed in the election by the Walla Walla Union- Bulletin, The Wenatchee World, the Tri-City Herald, and The Seattle Times. She was also endorsed by the Washington Education Association, which typically endorsed Democrats. With Wyman's victory, Republicans extended their control of the office of Secretary of State of Washington to 48 consecutive years, having won each of the preceding 12 elections.

He is a principal researcher at Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP) and professor of theoretical physics at Novosibirsk State University (NSU).  Biography  Victor S. Fadin was born in Poperechnoe village in Novosibirsk oblast on 28 November 1942. He graduated from NSU in 1965 and joined V. N. Baier's group in BINP Theory division. In 1983 he received his doctor of Science degree from BINP and in 1993 he became professor of theoretical physics. From 2001 to 2012 he worked as head of BINP Theory division. He is a principal researcher of BINP Theory division now. Since 1967 Victor Fadin has been working at NSU theoretical physics chair. From 1991 to 1997 he was dean of NSU Physics department.

He has a son and a daughter.  Academic achievements  Fadin is an expert in quantum field theory (QFT) and an author of more than 190 academic papers including 2 monographs, which have collected over 12 000 citations.http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/V.S.Fadin.1 In 2001 he received The Humboldt Prize in physics and in 2006 he was given the Russian Federation honorific title \\"–ó–∞—Å–ª—É–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –≤—ã—Å—à–µ–π —à–∫–æ–ª—ã –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏\\". In 2015 Victor Fadin was awarded the Pomeranchuk Prize \\"for his results devoted to high energy processes in QED and QCD\\". He shared the 2015 prize with professor Stanley J. Brodsky. He was one of the first to theoretically study a number of QED processes observed at the pioneering colliders VEP-1 and VEPP-2 in Novosibirsk. He worked out the structure function method for calculation of QED radiative corrections to cross sections of electron-positron annihilation and electron-nucleus scattering processes. Moreover, he developed the method of quasi-real particles, which was the first step to the parton picture in QFT. Professor Fadin's main contributions to QCD comprise the description of the coherence effects in the soft gluon emission and the study of the energy behavior of amplitudes in the Regge limit. The latter lead him to the development of Reggeization theory and the formulation of the BFKL (Balitsky- Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov) evolution equation for high-energy amplitudes. The BFKL equation predicted the rise of QCD cross sections as the colliding energy increases, which was later observed at HERA collider. This success established the BFKL approach as the basis of the modern theory of semi-hard processes in QCD. In recent years V. S. Fadin with his colleagues developed the BFKL approach in the next to leading logarithm approximation. Among his other achievements is the investigation of Coulomb effects in W+W- production.

The application allows the user to record one second of video every day and then chronologically edits (mashes) them together into a single film. It is compatible with iOS and Android. The idea of the application was developed by Kuriyama's 1 Second Everyday ‚Äì Age 30 video. The application was launched in January 2013. 1 Second Everyday played a part in the plot of Chef and also became the inspiration for the 2014 short animated clip Feast.FEAST Animated Short & Interview w/ the Director & Producer #BigHero6Event Cookies and Clogs, Retrieved on 1 August 2015  Background  = Kuriyama's video = In February 2011, when Cesar Kuriyama turned 30, after saving money, he quit his job in an advertising firm and took a year off to travel. During this time, he started working on a project he called 1 Second Everyday. As part of the project, every day he recorded one second of video ‚Äì something that was supposed to help him remember that day. He started the project because he was frustrated with his memory. He planned to stockpile the 365 one-second clips into one film to serve as a memento of his year. While working on the project Kuriyama realized that recording one second every day impacted the decisions he made in a positive way. After a year he made a 365-second clip out of his recordings. The video called 1 Second Everyday ‚Äì Age 30, which went viral, documented a marriage, a funeral, long-term sickness, moments with family and friends, holidays, food and nature. According to Kuriyama, he was initially inspired to take a year off from work by a TED talk given by Stefan Sagmeister called \\"The Power of Time Off.\\" Kuriyama also delivered a TED talk about 1 Second Everyday in 2012 at TED 2012 in Long Beach California. = Kickstarter campaign = After completing his own video, Kuriyama decided to develop an application that would allow the users to record one second every day and compile their own videos. He developed a prototype of the application and then in 2012, he launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for completing the application. The campaign became one of the most backed app campaigns in the history of Kickstarter. It was backed by 11,281 backers who pledged a total of $56,959 on an initial goal of $20,000. Following the completion of the Kickstarter campaign, he partnered with an application design studio in Brooklyn to develop the application. 1 Second Everyday was released two weeks after the completion of its Kickstarter campaign.  Application  The application was released for iOS on 10 January 2013. An Android-compatible version of the application was developed later. Using it, the user can record the videos in the application or they can select one second portions from their libraries. 1 Second Everyday dates every snippet. The user can also set alarms to remember to record their daily video. In order to compile a video, the user selects the seconds they want and the application creates a compilation video. The user can keep multiple timelines. It also allows users to post directly on social networks. The main interface in 1 Second Everyday is a calendar, which shows the user which days have snippets, and which they can still fill in. In the beginning, 1 Second Everyday restricted the recording to one second. However, the developers later released Super Seconds, which allowed users to record an additional half a second video. In 2014, 1 Second Everyday Crowds was launched, which is an area in the application featuring compilations of second clips from different users.  In the media  The Kickstarter campaign of 1 Second Everyday was featured in Entrepreneur's 3 Innovative Tech Startups on Kickstarter Right Now in 2012. The application was featured in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Gawker and other media outlets. By the end of the launch day, it was in Top 10 Free Apps on App Store. It was also selected as the App of the Week on GeekWire in 2013. Several other one-second compilation videos were also posted on the Internet after Kuriyama's video gained media attention. Sam Cornwell, an English photographer documented his son Indigo's growth using a montage of one-second iPhone clips. He shot these clips every single day from the moment of birth right up to the baby's first birthday. According to Cornwell, he was inspired by Kuriyama's project. The video of Cornwell's son gained considerable media attention after it was posted on YouTube. Save the Children also made a video commercial based on a similar format that showed a British girl oblivious of the Syrian war end up being a refugee. 1SE was a finalist for the Fast Company Innovation by Design Award in 2015, but lost to Google Maps.The 54 Finalists In Our Innovation By Design Awards Fast, Retrieved on 18 August 2015 In 2015, Google Android created a gallery, Leap Second 2015, with the help of Droga5 and Kuriyama.

It is an orographically right tributary of the Rodalb. In its upper reaches it is also called M√ºhlgraben.  Course  The Merzalbe rises in the middle of the Palatine Forest, west of the Palatine Watershed and between the two hills of the Wei√üenberg and the Eschkopf at a height of just under 500 metres. Its source is enclosed by the Christelbrunnen well. As it heads in a southwesterly direction the Merzalbe flows through the valley below the village of Leimen and then through Merzalben. After it empties from the right into the Rodalb near the Riegelbrunnerhof, a hamlet belonging to M√ºnchweiler. Its waters then flow down the Schwarzbach, Blies, Saar and Moselle before finally reaching the Rhine.  Name  The name \\"Merzalbe\\" means \\"stream of the Mericho\\" (Bach des Mericho) and goes back to a Frankish settler who must have made his residence here long before the first record in 1237 of the place of the same name by the stream. In this document Count was given Castrum Grebinstein and granted the villages of Merichisalbin, Rothalbin and Eiswilre. In ignorance of this recorded origin of the name, a theory later arose that the name \\"Merzalb\\" meant \\"harmful / useless stream\\", because the first part of the name was thought to be related to the word ausmerzen (\\"eradicate\\") and thus to mean that either large amounts of water poured through the valley when the snow melted, causing damage, or that - more likely - the stream usually had too little water to be suitable for the operation of a mill.  Sights  Gr√§fenstein Castle's bergfried above the Merzalb valley Gr√§fenstein Castle ‚Äì the castle which measures 80 by 60 metres, above the Merzalb valley is one of the best preserved and most impressive castles built by the Hohenstaufen dynasty in the Palatinate region.

History  Formed in 1998, the Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence brings together law enforcement, academic, and commercial organizations actively engaged in the field of digital forensics to develop cross-disciplinary guidelines and standards for the recovery, preservation, and examination of digital evidence. Originally named the Technical Working Group (TWG) on Digital Evidence, it became SWGDE when TWGs were renamed to Scientific Working Groups (SWGs) in 1999 in order to distinguish the Federal Bureau of Investigation-supported long-term working groups from National Institute of Justice-supported short-term TWGs. SWGs are ongoing groups that meet at least once per year, and have federal, state and local members. The goal of these groups is to open lines of communication between law enforcement agencies and forensic laboratories around the world while providing guidance on the use of new and innovative technologies and techniques. The initial members of SWGDE were made up of the Federal Forensic Laboratories as well as representatives of several agencies that performed digital forensics outside the traditional forensic laboratory. Soon representatives from state and local agencies were invited to participate. Today, the members are federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, academic organizations, and commercial entities. The first meeting of SWGDE was held in July 1998 and the group defined digital evidence as \\"any information of probative value that is stored or transmitted in a binary form.\\" This includes digitized text, numerals, sound, images, and video. \\"Binary\\" was later changed to \\"digital.\\" Some of SWGDE‚Äôs earliest work explored the principles of digital forensics and developed some baseline definitions. In 1999, at the request of the Group of Eight (G8), the International Organization on Computer Evidence (IOCE), which is no longer a functioning organization, with SWGDE contributions, authored a set of principles and definitions that the group felt were as close to universal as possible. These principles were published in the Forensic Science Communications journal and submitted to the G8; the principles were adopted by the G8 in 2001. By 2003, SWGDE had published guidelines for training and best practices. As a result of these efforts, the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) approved digital evidence as part of its accreditation process for crime laboratories in 2003. Today, the discipline is referred to as Digital and Multimedia Evidence and comprises the sub- disciplines of computer forensics, audio, video and imaging.  SWGDE Organization  The SWGDE membership presently consists of approximately seventy (maximum 100) forensic examiners, scientists, and managers from more than two dozen federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, as well as representatives from the academic, private, and research communities. The membership elects its officers from within. SWGDE is composed of an Executive Board, eight standing committees, and ad-hoc committees appointed on an as- needed basis. The standing committees are Audio Forensics, Computer Forensics, Imaging, Photography, Quality Standards, Video, Membership, and Outreach. The Imaging, Photography, and Video committees were added in June 2015, when the Scientific Working Group on Imaging Technology (SWGIT) terminated operations.  SWGDE Function  SWGDE provides guidance to the digital forensic community through the publication of standards, guidelines, and best practices on its website. SWGDE also encourages a number of its published documents to be used by standard developing organizations (e.g. ASTM International) in the creation of national and international standards for digital and multimedia evidence. One such document that has become an ASTM standard is the \\"Standard Practice for Computer Forensics\\" (ASTM E2763). Additionally, SWGDE may answer direct inquiries using letters or position statements, which are also typically posted on the website. Due to the rapidly evolving field of digital forensics, there is a great deal of debate regarding accreditation, certification, and proficiency testing legislation for digital forensic labs, personnel, and tools. SWGDE does not accredit, certify, approve, or qualify laboratories or individuals. SWGDE promotes the establishment and maintenance of a robust quality system through the publication of relevant guidance documents and position papers, such as, guidelines for validation testing and minimum requirements for quality assurance. SWGDE documents seek to provide a framework for agencies to insert their own criteria and describe what should be included in a protocol, while not requiring a particular format or content. SWGDE documents are freely available to the community-at-large, with the goal that agencies wishing to create or improve digital evidence programs will thoughtfully examine and consider their guidance. Documents are first published as a draft version for comment from the public. This provides the public with an opportunity to provide feedback, changes, and objections to any portion before the document becomes final. All feedback is reviewed and, when accepted, incorporated before the document is published as a final version. SWGDE invites all interested parties to review and comment on any published draft or final documents available through its website. SWGDE has published over 40 guidance documents, including joint documents with SWGIT, since its inception. In addition to releasing documents, SWGDE members disseminate best practices for law enforcement professionals where digital and multimedia evidence is concerned. This is carried out by attending and lecturing at meetings and conferences of various forensic organizations that include: *The American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS) *The International Association for Identification (IAI) *The American Society of Crime Lab Directors (ASCLD)  A sampling of published documents  *Digital and Multimedia Evidence Glossary *Best Practices for Computer Forensics *Best Practices for Mobile Phone Examinations *Best Practices for Forensic Audio *SWGDE Best Practices for the Forensic Use of Photogrammetry *Model Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Computer Forensics *Model Quality Assurance Manual (QAM) for Digital Evidence Laboratories *Establishing Confidence in Digital Forensic Results by Error Mitigation Analysis *Proficiency Test Guidelines  References   External links  * The Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE) * The Scientific Working Group on Imaging Technology (SWGIT) * American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS) * American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB) * Institute of Justice Forensic Sciences (NIJ) Category:Organizations established in 1998 Category:Digital forensics organizations ","title":"Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence"},{"id":"42772589","text":"Zbigniew Doda (22 February 1931 - 8 February 2013) was a Polish chess player who twice won the Polish Chess Championship in 1964 and 1967.

He received acting lessons from John Henderson, and made his first appearance on the stage as Richard III on 20 April 1785 at Norwich. Becoming known as the \\"Norwich Roscius\\", Harley was engaged by Thomas Harris for Covent Garden Theatre, where he appeared as Richard 25 September 1789. In the course of this and two or three following seasons he played Shylock, Touchstone, King Lear, and Macbeth, and took original characters in plays of William Hayley and other writers. For career reasons he withdrew into the provincial theatres; but returned to Covent Garden, where he remained for four seasons. He then once more went into the provinces, and played old men in comedy with success at Bristol in 1796‚Äì9, and then at Birmingham, Sheffield, Wolverhampton, and elsewhere. In 1802 he supported Sarah Siddons in her farewell visit to Dublin. Harley died at Leicester, 28 November 1811.

It is accessible via website and mobile app for iOS and Android. GetYourGuide's sells tours and excursions, activities including cooking classes, and tickets to many tourist attractions. It offers more than 40,000 products worldwide.Dill, Kathryn: \\"Up-And-Comers: Travel Guides\\". Forbes. Retrieved 17 March 2014. History The idea for GetYourGuide was conceived in 2007 by co-founders Johannes Reck and Tao Tao. When traveling to Beijing for a student conference with ETH MUN, they found navigating a foreign city as tourists to be difficult. Drawing on that experience, a business plan was developed for a peer-to-peer Internet platform that connected tourists with amateur guides. Later, it was expanded and refined to be an internet booking platform through which travelers could book professional tours and activities in major cities around the world. The company was initially funded by the founder's parents and relatives. As it grew, there was difficulty in raising capital, in part because the concept was new, information on the size and complexity of the market segment was scarce, and there was no business model or demonstrable path to success. While many European investors balked at the idea, American investors were attracted to the concept, because it represented what they felt to be a good business idea, with no competition. The business model for GetYourGuide stipulates that it does not offer its own tours or activities, but rather, acts as a mediator between customers and providers. The service is free for customers, but the provider of the tour has to pay GetYourGuide a percentage of its revenue. An online customer review system enables potential customers to assess the quality of tour providers. Additionally, GetYourGuide removes providers who consistently get bad reviews from its inventory. In January 2013, when GetYourGuide announced $14 million in Series A funding, one of the goals was to develop its mobile apps. In October, it launched apps for iOS and Android. The app could pull in info on more than 23,000 tours & activities from 2,200 global destinations then available on the GetYourGuide's platform, presenting them initially as a stack of thumbnails. The app is also able to detect the user's location, and make relevant suggestions. In April 2013, GetYourGuide acquired Gidsy, which had also been developing mobile apps and had a team of 12 developers. As a spin- off of ETH, GetYourGuide was initially headquartered in Zurich. The new company relocated its headquarters in 2012 to Berlin, where office space was more affordable and readily available. The German capital was also one of the focal points of the still young European startup ecosystem. An office in Zurich was maintained primarily for engineering teams. In October 2017, GetYourGuide opened a new engineering office in Zurich. In November 2017, GetYourGuide announced a $75 million Series D funding round raised to help support expansion in Asia and the Americas, and soon after, added traditional Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Mexican Spanish as supported languages for its global inventory. Earlier in the year, regional offices were opened in Hong Kong and Bangkok. These additions brought the total number of languages supported on GetYourGuide to 18. In August 2018, GetYourGuide began selling tours under its own brand name. The company mined its data on customer preferences from having sold 15 million tours since its founding nearly a decade ago. From that information, it developed standardized criteria for how to best run a tour. To be labeled a GetYourGuide tour, an operator must agree to follow its best practices regarding meeting points, check-in processes, starting times, duration, and other factors. In return, the retailer will send more customers the operator's way. In July 2018, Udi Nir was hired as chief technology officer. Nir previously was VP Engineering for Instacart and CTO of ModCloth. In September 2018, Sharon McCollam, formerly head of finance at consumer electronics retailer Best Buy, was appointed to the board of directors. In April 2019, GetYourGuide raised a $484 million investment from SoftBank Group. This infusion of capital raised its valuation above the $1 billion mark, making it a unicorn. During the COVID-19 pandemic, revenues fell 95%. The company also went fully remote.

Mobile sales enablement is part of the larger sales enablement process. There are many ways that organizations use mobile devices to functionally enhance the sales process. Behaviors completed on a mobile device may include but are not limited to the use of specialized applications, distribution of dynamic content, mobile email tactics or messaging such as push notifications, etc.  Origin  Mobile sales enablement is an extension of the long-standing sales enablement strategy. IDC defines sales enablement as: ‚ÄúGetting the right information into the hands of the right seller at the right time and place, and in the right format, to move a sales opportunity forward‚Äù When the first iPad was released, some entrepreneurs took the opportunity to develop mobile apps that enabled salesmen to sell everywhere. These were initiated out of costly custom agency builds that were difficult to maintain. As technology progressed, standardized apps were developed. Some apps focus on content distribution others are focused on more transactional functions. The definition does not, and should not, define the strategies, tactics, or technologies used to accomplish it. It is a vendor-neutral approach that focuses upon the alignment of sales with marketing, customer success, finance, and product organizations.  Devices  Mobile sales enablement can be applied to all mobile devices. This often includes tablets and smartphones. However; the downside of smartphones is the smaller screen size, in comparison with a tablet which has a larger screen for sharing presentations or materials to an audience. Good apps will tailor the benefits of the solution to the specific selling behavior for the devices.  The difference between mobile sales enablement and a CRM  There may be confusion between the terms mobile sales enablement and customer relationship management. This is mostly due to the fact that a lot of CRM providers have a mobile version of their software. CRM software is designed to manage relationships with customers using a database of customers, prospects, and support staff. Meanwhile, mobile sales enablement is focused on making salespeople more successful while on the go. Some mobile sales enablement solutions integrate seamlessly with an already existing CRM solution, thereby helping both tools to be more successful.  Opportunities  Research by Demand Metric into the cost of a bad sales experience indicated that a misalignment between sales and marketing is key to a loss in revenue. Specifically, 72% of sales and marketing professionals agree on this statement. 60% of these professionals often deliver bad sales experiences. The cause of this problem is due to sales thinking that marketing materials lack quality, while marketers think salespeople are not using the content the right way. Mobile sales enablement provides a solution to this problem. In a recent research conducted by BSharp Sales Enablers, 96% of field sales team said they preferred a mobile sales enablement solution to a PC based solution. Profitable Channels conducted research into the opportunities provided by mobile sales enablement. They found 3 areas where mobile sales enablement had a lot of potential: * Drive revenue growth: By having access to the right sales information at the right time, at the right place, the revenue/sale go up. * Improve sales effectiveness: Due to simplifying the sales process, improving sales productivity, and showing a return on the investment of sales assets. * Differentiate the customer experience: A higher level of collaboration, a visually clean sales interface and client insights help with bringing the customer experience to a higher level. Sales Enablement Sales enablement serves to equip each side of a transaction with the tools to optimize outcome. They often work most directly with marketing and sales teams, assisting with business-to-business sales. Enablement teams have three major functions: creating content (i.e., marketing material), managing digital platforms, and providing training to employees. Enablement teams serve a critical role in a company, and companies of different sizes are engaging them. For instance, sales enablement teams equip the sales group with the most updated sale enablement approaches, making them competitive in the market, and consequently scaling up the success of the company by teaching collaboration culture, proper choice of tools, and exercising oversight.

It grows on dung or compost (rotten organics). It is notable for being a eukaryote with a high temperature tolerance (60 ¬∞C). Its optimal growth temperature is 50‚Äì55 ¬∞C. Research Chaetomium thermophilum is a focus of research at the Biochemistry Department at Heidelberg University, Germany. Since fungi are eukaryotic and not distant from animals they are good models for comparative and easy-to-manipulate research, and in the case of C. thermophilum, it is of special significance. First, given the fact it is thermophilic, proteins derived from this fungus are heat stable and thus easier to work with. Proteins from C. thermophilum are thermophilic and thus better for studies (structural and biochemical) than comparable mesophilic fungi. Studying nuclear pore complex proteins, it was found that protein isolation was more abundant and more soluble than in yeast (yeast proteins precipitate at a lower temperature).Insight into Structure and Assembly of the Nuclear Pore Complex by Utilizing the Genome of a Eukaryotic Thermophile  Genome and proteome  The genome of C. thermophilum has been completely sequenced. It spans 28.3 Mb and encodes 7227 predicted protein coding genes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model yeast, has 73% protein homology to this fungus. The proteome of C. thermophilum has been studied and 27 distinct protein communities, including 108 interconnected complexes have been identified.  Model system for identifying higher-order protein interactions  Cryo-electron microscopic image of fractionated lysate from C. thermophilum cellular extracts. Megadalton protein complexes are observed (e.g. the barrel-shaped fatty acid synthase) that are either co-eluting or interacting to form higher-order protein complex assemblies (communities). The first observation of a metabolon in fatty acid metabolism at high resolution came from cryo-electron microscopic analysis of cellular homogenates from C. thermophilum. Other protein complexes and higher-order interactions were predicted and validated using a novel integration of experimental and computational methods which include proteomics, cross-linking mass spectrometry, computational structural biology and electron microscopy. The cellular homogenates of C. thermophilum were used to derive protein complex structures at high resolution, with purity of the native protein complex < 40%.

Founded shortly after the London Chronicle and similar in format, it came out on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, alternating in \\"friendly rivalry\\" with the London Chronicle which came out on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.Solomon, Harry M. (1996). The Rise of Robert Dodsley: Creating the New Age of Print, p. 331. Southern Illinois University Press. History The Lloyd's Evening Post was founded in July 1757 by James Emonson (a former partner of William Bowyer), and was published from Emonson's printing office in St John's Square, Clerkenwell. According to the colophon of the July 14‚Äì16, 1762 edition, copies of the paper could be purchased from W. Nicoll in St. Paul's Church Yard, and letters to the editor and advertisements were accepted at Lloyd's Coffee House and at the publisher's. John Rivington (1756‚Äì1785), a member of the Rivington publishing family, began working for Emonson in 1777 and took over the printing business when Emonson retired. Complicating matters somewhat was another tri-weekly, The London Packet, which was founded in 1771 and in 1777 changed its subtitle to \\"The New Lloyd's Evening Post\\". The Lloyd's Evening Post issue for June 8‚Äì10, 1778 announced that the newspaper would henceforth be published by Rivington at 59 Paternoster Row.Fitzpatrick, Barbara Laning (2004). \\"Rivington family (per. c.1710‚Äìc.1960)\\".

It formed as a lesbian organization in 1986 and has focused on issues such as reforming the words used to refer to same sex desire and campaigning for same sex marriage to be legally recognised. It became dormant around 2011.  History  Anjaree was formed originally in 1986 by a small group of lesbian feminist activists, which included Anjana Suvarnananda and Chanthalak Raksayu. The organization articulated lesbian issues in the women's movement in Thailand and the society at large. Suvarnananda was inspired by her experiences studying in the Netherlands. Anjaree organizers were among the first to organize and host an Asian Lesbian Network in 1990, which gained international attention, especially throughout Asia. Successes included stopping the Rajabhat Institute's discriminatory rules on banning transgender people from enrollment at its institute during 1996 and publicizing the decision by the Ministry of Health not to class homosexuality as a pathological condition. The group then became dormant around 2011.Megan Sinnott. Queer Bangkok: twenty- first-century markets, media, and rights. Aberdeen, Hong Kong: Hong Kong U Press, 2011. Print.  Same-sex marriage  Anjaree has long campaigned for recognition of same sex marriage in Thailand as in other Asian countries such as Taiwan. In 2019, a legal challenge was made to the Civil and Commercial Code. Anjana Suvarnananda commented to the Thomson Reuters Foundation that if it the challenge failed, there was a \\"risk that the outdated notion of marriage will persist for a while\\".  Semantic issues  Anjaree focused on the terminology used to describe same sex desire. Thai psychologists had put people into groups named \\"rak-tang-pet\\" (heterosexual) and \\"rak-ruam-pet\\" (homosexual). The \\"katoey\\" (transgender) is an ancient Thai word, which is also employed to describe camp gay men as well as transgender people and thus is being used in a derogatory way, since it suggests gay men are not real men. To go beyond the traditional categorisation of women as either \\"tom\\" (butch) or \\"dee\\" (femme), Anjaree activists promoted a new identity category known as \\"ying rak ying\\", which translates as simply \\"women who love women\\". One of the notable advantages of \\"ying rak ying\\" was that it dovetailed with transnational LGBTIQ movements and helped Anjaree to contest local anti-LGBTIQ discourses.  Awards  Anjaree received the Felipa de Souza Award in 1995 from the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (now OutRight Action International).

Although the PRC oil rig was used as the rallying event, several of the early organizers are claimed to have stated that they organized the protests to complain about government repression of free speech and government collaboration with China, and that using the oil rig as the stated cause of the protests was done in an attempt to prevent governmental backlash. \\\\- Article is behind a paywall. In B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province, the province most heavily affected by the protests, only 14 of the 351 factories that were damaged, looted, or destroyed were owned by Chinese corporations. Background Timeline *May 11: Anti-China protests started in Hanoi, Da Nang, Can Tho and Ho Chi Minh city. The size and number of protests were unprecedented as the government took the unusual step of permitting street protests to show its displeasure with Beijing. *May 12: Workers in a B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng industrial park went on strike to join the anti-China protest. *May 13: The protest in B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng and Dong Nai escalated to violent riot.

Several factories were burnt down overnight, their equipment damaged and stocks looted by rioters. One death was reported in a torched Taiwanese-invested bicycle factory. Over a thousand were arrested, with many claiming that they have been manipulated by people who distributed flags and T-shirts, and later to join the riot. *May 14: Riots flare up in the Formosa Steel Mill in Vung Ang, central H√† Tƒ©nh Province, in response to a rumour of a Vietnamese worker killed there. Casualty reports varied from 2 to 21. At Binh Duong, in fear of a second wave of riot, many workers formed a barricade inside their factories and chanted \\"Protecting the workplace means protecting Spratly and Paracel island\\" Chinese nationals began to flee to Cambodia in hundreds to escape the riots. *May 16: Vietnamese and Filipinos staged a joint protest in Manila. *May 18: A planned second protest in Hanoi and Saigon which was called for several political and dissident groups were subdued. According to some witnesses, 15 to 20 protesters were seen arrested and thrown into unmarked vans.

Further protests by overseas Vietnamese continued in various locations worldwide, including London, Sydney, Paris, Houston, Hong Kong, and Los Angeles, especially in front of Chinese embassies and consulates. In response to the riot, the Chinese government evacuated around 3,000 Chinese nationals from Vietnam by chartered planes and ships, including 16 injured Chinese workers. *May 23: A woman died after immolating herself in front of the Independence Palace in Ho Chi Minh City in protest against China. *May 25: Another wave of protests occurred in various overseas countries including Hong Kong,\\"Vietnamese stage small anti-China protest in Hong Kong\\", Adam Rose, UK Reuters, 2014-05-25 and Sweden. *May 26: Thanh Nien newspaper reported two men had been sentenced to jail by Vietnamese court for taking part in deadly anti- China rioting. 23-year-old Le Van Nghiem was sentenced to three years in prison for \\"causing public disorder\\" and property destruction. 18-year-old Chau Vinh Tuong was sentenced to one year in prison for stealing a computer.\\"Vietnam jails two over anti-China riots\\", ABC.net.au, May 26, 2014 *June 5: The sinking of another Vietnamese ship by Chinese ships was caught on film.\\"Video shows Vietnam fishing boat sink after collision with Chinese vessel\\", Reuters, June 5, 2014 *June 20: A 71-year-old man of Vietnamese descent attempted to set himself on fire at the entrance to the Silver Lake Community in Florida's Manatee County, leaving a note protesting recent China's move.

Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Mill riot The Formosa Ha Tinh Steel company and associated port facilities in Vung Ang, H√† Tƒ©nh Province in central Vietnam, 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Hanoi, is operated by the Taiwanese conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group, one of the largest foreign investors in Vietnam. The complex employs more than 2,600 foreign workers, among them more than 1,500 are Chinese nationals. Friction arose between locals and foreign workers and clashes broke out sporadically. In 2013, a Taiwanese accountant were stabbed to death in one such clash. On May 11, a 1,000 strong group of workers and locals formed an anti-China parade that turned into riot. The mob stormed the steel mill, lit fires at the furnace and several buildings and hunted down the Chinese workers. At least one Chinese worker was killed and 90 are injured. Reactions Initially, Hanoi lauded the \\"patriotic\\" displays by its citizens, but reversed after the violence turned badly citing the country's image being stained as a safe destination for sorely needed foreign investment.

Life and work Cowie was born in Falkirk, Scotland, the son of a brewer. After an apprenticeship as a saddler and harness maker in London, Cowie emigrated to Australia in 1840; and, after a spell in Van Diemen's Land, he settled in Geelong, which was then known as Corio. He established a number of successful commercial ventures, including shops and a mining & shipping agency, and he made his fortune during the Victorian gold rush. When the Geelong municipality was formed in 1849, he was among those who provided financial securities for the new body to carry out works and topped the poll in the first elections for the council. In November 1852, Cowie was elected mayor of Geelong. He served as mayor for a year before being elected to represent Geelong in the Legislative Council of Victoria following the separation of Victoria from New South Wales in 1851. After two years, he resigned to undertake a short visit to Britain. He returned to Australia aboard the Schomburg, which was wrecked on its maiden voyage off Port Campbell. Cowie was rescued and returned to Geelong. From October 1956 Cowie served on the new Legislative Council representing South Western Province until September 1858 before being elected to the Legislative Assembly for Geelong East.

Washington law does not describe an order of precedence for state decorations, though the Medal of Valor is generally considered the state's second-highest honor, after the Medal of Merit. Medal =Qualifications= The Medal of Valor is awarded for valorous actions done to save the life of another person and undertaken at risk of injury or death. All persons, living or dead, except persons employed in \\"hazardous professions\\" (specifically including police and firefighters), are eligible for the medal. The medal is bestowed by the Governor of Washington on the advice of the \\"medal of valor committee,\\" which is composed of the governor himself, as well as the chief justice of the Washington State Supreme Court, the speaker of the Washington State House of Representatives, and the president of the Washington State Senate. The Washington Secretary of State serves as the committee's secretary. The process for nomination is not set by law, but, under current rules adopted by the committee, any person may nominate a qualified candidate through submission of a letter of nomination to the secretary of state who periodically presents received nominations to the committee for consideration. =Design and presentation= State law requires that the Medal of Valor \\"be of .999 pure silver and shall consist of the seal of the state of Washington, surrounded by a raised laurel wreath and suspended from a silver bar device inscribed \\"For Valor\\" which is suspended from a ring attached by a dark green ribbon, bordered by silver.\\" In addition to the recipient's name, the reverse reads \\"for exceptionally valorous service, given in the act of saving the life of another.\\" By custom, the medal is awarded by the Governor during a joint session of the Washington State Senate and Washington State House of Representatives at the Washington State Capitol specially convened for the purpose of presenting the award. The authorizing legislation does not specify a frequency for issuing the medal, and it has generally been awarded sparsely and irregularly. Currently, medals are struck by the Northwest Territorial Mint, a private mint located in Dayton, Nevada. Background =History= The Medal of Valor was established by an act of the Washington Legislature, introduced by state senator Don Benton, in 1999. The first medals were presented in 2006. = Recipients = * James Swett of Sedro Wooley, Washington received the Medal of Valor in 2006. In 2004 Swett happened upon a fiery car accident on Interstate 5 near Smokey Point, Washington. Swett smashed the window of one of the involved vehicles to gain access to the driver, whom he dragged from the wreck. He then improvised a tow cable which he used to pull the vehicle, which was in danger of being engulfed in flame, to safety, before prying open a door to rescue two injured children who were trapped inside. * Gregory Meinhold of Everett, Washington received the Medal of Valor in 2006. In 2001 Meinhold spotted a man and a dog in Silver Lake both of whom appeared to be drowning. Meinhold rushed to a nearby restaurant and expropriated a decorative canoe that was on display. He launched the boat into the lake, using it to successfully rescue both the man and the dog. * Travis Jackson and Dennis Kinsey of Clark County, Washington each received a Medal of Valor in 2006. In 2005 Jackson and Kinsey discovered a Jeep engulfed in flame outside Orchards, Washington. The two used a fire extinguisher to subdue the flames before extricating the driver, calling 911, and then administering first aid to the injured man until paramedics arrived. * Edward Marsette of Auburn, Washington received the Medal of Valor in 2007. While at home in 2006 Marsette heard a loud crash. Upon investigation, he discovered a car had overturned and burst into flames on the street outside his house. Marsette raced to the vehicle and pulled four people to safety, suffering second and third degree burns in the process. As the first police officer arrived, ammunition from a loaded pistol stored in the vehicle began to detonate due to the intensity of the fire. Despite being badly injured from the burns he'd suffered rescuing the vehicle's passengers, Marsette ran several hundred yards to warn the approaching officer to stop and proceed with caution due to the igniting bullets. * Alana Schutt of Snohomish County, Washington received the Medal of Valor in 2007. In 2006 Schutt saw a distressed boat in Martha Lake. Schutt used a paddle boat to reach the sinking vessel, aiding three men into it. Her own boat over capacity, Schutt then jumped into the lake and swam to shore, pulling the paddle boat behind her. * Timohty Bourasaw and Rick Bowers of Arlington, Washington each received a Medal of Valor in 2007. In 2006 Bourasaw and Bowers discovered two persons trapped in a vehicle engulfed in flame on Interstate 5.

It was the oldest systems management company in the world before being bought out in a stock swap by BMC Software in 1998.  History  Boole & Babbage was founded in 1967 as K & K Associates by Ken Kolence and David Kaitch. The company changed its name to Boole & Babbage after an investment from Franklin \\"Pitch\\" Johnson, becoming the first software company in Silicon Valley to receive venture capital funding. Its main product was a computer mainframe monitoring package which was the first software that allowed the tracking of hours. The company had a million dollars in sales in its first year. However, the company's large expenses outstripped its profits. In 1972 Bruce Coleman was appointed as president to lower expenses, which was accomplished by 1978, after which he left the company. Boole & Babbage almost went bankrupt when their products became obsolete due to upgrades in IBM hardware. In the 1980s, Boole & Babbage developed new software and went public. In 1984 IBM changed its operating systems, rendering a number of Boole & Babbage's products obsolete. In response, Coleman returned as president. The company created COMMAND/Post for client/server systems in 1990, and it soon became their main product.  Advertising  In 1993, Boole & Babbage announced at the Computer Measurement Group annual conference that they had bought a two-year licence from Paramount Pictures to use Star Trek imagery in their advertising for COMMAND/Post and MainView for $75,000 a year. They used Commander William Riker (played by Jonathan Frakes) from Star Trek: The Next Generation in their first Star Trek advertisements. Frakes also starred in an advert for Boole & Babbage titled \\"The Vision\\" as Commander Riker and the USS Enterprise bridge set.  Decline and sale  In the late 1990s, the computer industry started to become dominated by larger companies and Boole & Babbage were having trouble competing. In 1998, as part of a series of takeovers, BMC Software bought Boole & Babbage in a stock swap.

It stars Jos√© Sacrist√°n as an old, bitter journalist who attempts to seduce a young journalism student played by Mar√≠a Valverde. It premiered at the 2011 San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival.  Plot  In 1987, Miguel, an old and bitter journalist, agrees to meet with √Ångela, an idealistic young journalism student, for an interview at a local restaurant. √Ångela has missed many of her lectures and needs to write an essay; she has chosen to use Miguel as her subject. Throughout the interview, Miguel expresses his contempt for idealism and style. When he reads a sample of √Ångela's writing, Miguel dismisses much of it, though he says that she is talented. He asks to keep the sample and invites √Ångela to his friend Luis' house. Miguel explains that Luis will be gone until Monday, and they will have the place to themselves. She agrees, and they continue their discussions there over whiskey. Miguel walks over Luis' paintings, and, when √Ångela objects, he says that Luis would prefer them to be marred by life and experience. Miguel alternates between cynical advice and derisively ridiculing romantic notions of journalism. Soon, he enters the bedroom and point blank asks √Ångela to strip naked. When she balks, he tells her that he has been true to his nature and never hidden his motives. When she turns to leave, Miguel stops her and says that he hopes she will one day respect him for his boldness. As Miguel smokes a cigarette, he hears the boards creaking, and √Ångela steps through the doorway wearing nothing but an open shirt. Surprised, Miguel wordlessly spreads paint over her naked body. √Ångela rises to wash it off, and he follows her to the bathroom. After they take turns in the shower, √Ångela becomes frustrated when she cannot open the door. Miguel tries as well and concludes that it has locked from the outside. The bathroom has only one towel, and both are naked; when he realizes her discomfort, Miguel surrenders the towel to √Ångela. The two continue their conversation from before, and Miguel alternates between attempts to seduce √Ångela, giving cynical advice, and expressing his preference for whiskey and cigarettes over company with her. As time passes, the two become worried that they will be missed: Miguel by his wife, and √Ångela by her parents. When Miguel learns that √Ångela is the daughter of a prominent fascist soldier, he describes his run-ins with fascists and failed attempts to seduce √Ångela's eldest sister. Although initially opposed to bringing in outside intervention, Miguel agrees that the risk of scandal is now outweighed by their desire to leave the bathroom. However, their cries out the window go apparently unheard. As Miguel becomes despondent about the situation, his age, his attractiveness, and his foolish desire to seduce to a much younger woman, √Ångela turns off the lights, drops her towel, and the two have sex. Afterward, Miguel dismisses her feelings of guilt and proclaims himself to have a more developed and profound sense of guilt. √Ångela angrily accuses him of egotism, which she says she will write about in her essay. They quickly reconcile when a chastened Miguel offers to entertain √Ångela with a story. The story, framed as an imaginary film that they are watching at the cinema, is about a boy who refuses to leave his bed under any circumstances. The boy insists that nothing is wrong with him; he simply desires not to leave his bed. When the boy mysteriously disappears, his parents are conflicted as to whether they should be glad he has left his bed or sad that he has run away. Before Miguel can end the story, Luis returns to rescue them, summoned by a worker who heard their earlier calls for help. Luis asks Miguel if he will see √Ångela again, but Miguel is philosophical. He tells Luis to keep a pair of glasses that √Ångela left behind and reasons that if she returns, it will be to Luis' house. The film ends as √Ångela walks back to her parents' house.  Cast  * Jos√© Sacrist√°n as Miguel * Mar√≠a Valverde as √Ångela * Ramon Fontser√® as Luis  Production  The film was shot in twelve days in Madrid. The inspiration for the film came from writer-director David Trueba's experiences as a young journalist in Spain in the 1980s.  Release  Madrid, 1987 premiered 22 September 2011 at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival. The international premiere was at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Breaking Glass Pictures released it on home video on 26 February 2013.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 86% of seven surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.6/10. Metacritic rated it 61/100 based on seven reviews. Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald rated it 3.5/4 stars and called it \\"an engrossing study of generational clash inside a locked bathroom.\\" Jonathan Holland of Variety called it a \\"perceptive\\" and \\"ultra-wordy\\" film that will mostly appeal to Spanish art-house audiences. Sheri Linden of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"The actors give their characters a resonance beyond the symbolic, but the action doesn't quite transcend the stagy setup.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"An engrossing two-hander combining the smart-talk microcosm of My Dinner With Andre and the sexual dynamics of a Philip Roth novel, David Trueba's Madrid, 1987 is more universal than its title suggests and holds a strong art house appeal.\\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called it a \\"sweet, sometimes dull and certainly overlong film\\". Fionnuala Halligan of Screen Daily wrote, \\"It is, in fact, hard to think of a movie less cinematic than Madrid, 1987\\" and stated that it might make a better play than film. Ollie Coen of DVD Talk rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"For an artsy movie about two people stuck naked in a bathroom together, you could do much worse. [...] It has a lot to say about youth, love, idealism, sex, and life in general.\\"  References   External links   Category:2011 films Category:2011 drama films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish drama films Category:Spanish independent films Category:Films about journalists Category:Films directed by David Trueba Category:Films set in 1987 Category:Films set in Madrid Category:Films shot in Madrid Category:2011 independent films ","title":"Madrid, 1987"},{"id":"42773040","text":"Archips strigopterus is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Because of the high amount of technical knowledge required, the total number of actual manufacturers remains very small.  Pouring  The process starts with two basic ingredients, an acrylic resin powder polymer and clear liquid monomer. The polymer and monomer are mixed together in specific proportions. The result is a thick, opaque liquid. The mixture is hand poured into molds and allowed to partially harden. Objects to be embedded are then hand placed into the acrylic layer. Another layer is poured over the embedded object and the acrylic is again allowed to harden. During this stage, the liquid acrylic is an opaque, milky white. It is very difficult to center objects on multiple levels when the objects below cannot be clearly seen. Because these embedded objects are placed by hand, no two acrylic embedments are ever exactly alike.  Curing  After the acrylic has hardened, the molds are placed into an oven. There, heat cures and pressure (exceeding 12 atmospheres) compresses the air bubbles to completely harden the embedment. This curing process may take up to seven hours. After cooling, the acrylic embedments are removed from the molds and the sizing process begins. All acrylic parts are cast oversized to allow for shrinkage, which varies from part to part. Three steps are taken to size the embedments.  Sanding  The parts are ground down to size by hand on large industrial sanders. A coarse grit belt is used first, followed by a medium grit belt. A final sanding with a fine grit belt makes it easier to polish the sanded acrylic. Variations occur in this sizing process since it is all done by hand.  Polishing  Polishing is the next step in the process. It is mostly done by hand. This brings out the luster and high gloss of the acrylic not previously seen during production. A rough buffing is administered to remove all sanding lines. A final polishing then brings out the bright crystal-like finish. The production of the acrylic embedment is completed.  Inspection  The final phase now begins. Each embedment is carefully hand wiped and visually inspected. If flaws or any other defects are detected, the part is returned for additional finishing or rejected for recycling. After passing through inspection, each part is individually bagged and boxed. This entire procedure makes the result more expensive but because of its glossy look an acrylic embedment is very much in demand.

Dunedin: Otago Heritage Books. . p.17 The MƒÅori name for the inlet was Puke-tu-roto, meaning either \\"hills standing around a lake\\" or \\"hills standing inland\\". Like its near neighbour, Papanui Inlet, Hoopers Inlet is known for its diverse bird life. The inlet lies 2 km to the south of Portobello and can be reached by road from both there and the city of Dunedin (of which it is administratively a part), the centre of which lies 15 kilometres to the west. Both inlets are shallow, becoming predominantly sand and mud flats at low tide. The mouth of Hoopers Inlet is narrowed by a large spit, the seaward coast of which forms Allans Beach. Behind this beach is a significant area of wetland and swamp, which is home to many species of flora and birds.\\"Hoopers Inlet Swamp\\", Otago Regional Council website. Hoopers Inlet is separated from Papanui Inlet by a strip of land which is the isthmus to a hilly peninsula containing Cape Saunders and the peninsula's highest point, the 408-metre Mount Charles.

This equestrian tradition's roots are from the early 19th century, when horses were introduced to Hawaii and ali ªi women dressed up to ride for formal occasions. It declined after the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, but was revitalized in the early 20th century with the establishment of formal riding organizations called Pa'u Riders. Today, they participate in Kamehameha Day floral parades and other parades and festivals throughout the islands. History The pa'u riding tradition began just after Captain Richard J. Cleveland introduced horses to Hawaii in 1803. Kamehameha disliked the creatures, partially on account of the amount of food they required, so western sailors began riding them along the beaches to demonstrate their capabilities. Hawaiian men and women quickly took to riding, establishing a long equestrian tradition that also includes the paniolo, the Hawaiian cowboy. As the early Western visitors to Hawaii were men, rather than women who might have introduced sidesaddle riding, Hawaiian women joined the men in learning to ride astride. Additionally, Hawaii soon established trade connections with Central and South America, where women often rode astride. This contact may have influenced the development of riding customs and dress among Hawaiian women.\\"A history of pa'u\\" (April 5, 2007). Hawaii Tribune-Herald. Adele Kauilani Robinson Lemke as a Pa'u Rider in her long skirt, 1913 The Pa'u Queen of the 100th Anniversary Kamehameha Day Floral Parade. June 11, 2016 The term pƒÅ ª≈´ means skirt in the Hawaiian language. Riders initially began wearing long skirts to protect their legs while traveling. Over time, as the riders took part in performances and displays, their outfits became more elaborate and elegant. English writer Isabella Bird visited Hawaii in 1873 and noted women riding astride, a notable difference from European custom.Jensen, Chelsea (April 11, 2011). \\"The pa'u tradition\\". Hawaii Tribune-Herald. As the Kingdom declined, so did this tradition. Attempts were made by the monarchy to revive the custom but were unsuccessful. In 1906, Lizzie Puahi organized the first association of women riders for a floral auto parade. Puahi began the Pa'u Rider's Club from her residence in Waikiki, Oahu, and began holding monthly gatherings. They recruited other women and practiced equestrianism. Soon afterwards, Theresa Wilcox began a riding society. Today, Pa'u riders are commonly seen in festivals and parades across Hawaii. The pronunciation of the word pa'u is in two syllables because of the use of the Hawaiian diacritic called the okina. This apostrophe-like symbol indicates a glottal stop and precedes a separate vowel sound. This keeps similarly spelled words such as pau (pronounced \\"pow\\") and pa'u (pronounced \\"pah-oo\\") from being confused.

Biography He was possibly the successor of the better known king Sehetepibenre Pedubast, and should have succeeded him in around 665 BCE, just one year before Psamtik I of the 26th Dynasty proclaimed himself pharaoh. His existence was proposed by the French Egyptologist Pierre Montet,Montet, Le lac sacr√© de Tanis, in M√©moires de l'Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles lettres XLIV (1956), Paris, pp. 73-5. who found in Tanis a few monuments bearing a partially erased royal titulary which was quite similar to the one of Pepi II Neferkare of the Old Kingdom. However, in one of these monuments is mentioned the goddess Mut, \\"Lady of Isheru\\", whose cult is typical of a more recent epoch. Furthermore, a cornice from Athribis bears both the cartouches of a Neferkare and a Wahibre; the latter likely is Psamtik I while the former could be this Tanite ruler. Based upon these findings, it is likely that Psamtik, once he became pharaoh, could no longer tolerate the multitude of rulers with claims of kingship upon the Lower Egypt, and in a few years he managed to force them to become his vassals, depriving them of royal titles and ambitions. Neferkare of Tanis ‚Äì who could have claimed a far more ancient royal line than that of Psamtik (since, technically, Neferkare was a distant successor of Shoshenq I of the 22nd Dynasty) ‚Äì was likely the last of them, but like all others he was finally subdued around 657‚Äì656 BCE.Toby Wilkinson, The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt, Bloomsbury Publishing, London, 2011, , p. 437.

Theophrastus looks at plant structure, reproduction and growth; the varieties of plant around the world; wood; wild and cultivated plants; and their uses. Book 9 in particular, on the medicinal uses of plants, is one of the first herbals, describing juices, gums and resins extracted from plants, and how to gather them. Historia Plantarum was written some time between c. 350 BC and c. 287 BC in ten volumes, of which nine survive. In the book, Theophrastus described plants by their uses, and attempted a biological classification based on how plants reproduced, a first in the history of botany. He continually revised the manuscript, and it remained in an unfinished state on his death. The condensed style of the text, with its many lists of examples, indicate that Theophrastus used the manuscript as the working notes for lectures to his students, rather than intending it to be read as a book. Historia Plantarum was first translated into Latin by Theodorus Gaza; the translation was published in 1483. Johannes Bodaeus published a frequently cited folio edition in Amsterdam in 1644, complete with commentaries and woodcut illustrations. The first English translation was made by Sir Arthur Hort and published in 1916. Book The Enquiry into Plants is in Hort's parallel text a book of some 400 pages of original Greek, consisting of about 100,000 words. It was originally organised into ten books, of which nine survive, though it is possible the surviving text represents all the material, rearranged into nine books rather than the original ten. Along with his other surviving botanical work, On the Causes of Plants, Enquiry into Plants was an important influence on science in the middle ages. On the strength of these books, the first scientific inquiries into plants and one of the first systems of plant classification, Linnaeus called Theophrastus \\"the father of botany\\".Fisher Library, 2014 Theophrastus's two plant books have similar titles to two books on animals by his mentor Aristotle; Roger French concludes that he was effectively \\"doing a peripatetic exercise\\"French, 1994. in identifying regularities in and differences between plants, in the manner of Aristotle with animals. However, he went beyond Aristotle in describing seeds as parts of the plant; Aristotle, French argues, would never have described semen or embryos as parts of an animal. Theophrastus made use of a variety of sources for the book, including Diocles on drugs and medicinal plants. Theophrastus claims to have gathered information from drug-sellers (pharmacopolai) and root-cutters (rhizotomoi). Plants described include poppy (mƒìk≈çn), hemlock, (k≈çnion), wild lettuce (thridakinƒì), and mandrake (mandragoras). The surviving texts are the notes that Theophrastus used in teaching, and they were continually revised. He referred to earlier books in the Lyceum library including Democritus, sometimes preserving fragments of books otherwise lost. He mentions about 500 species of plant. Translations Title page of Sir Arthur Hort's edition with parallel Greek and English text, 1916 The Enquiry into Plants (along with the Causes of Plants) was first translated into Latin by Theodore Gaza by 1454, circulated in manuscript, and then published at Treviso in 1483. In its original Greek it first appeared from the press of Aldus Manutius at Venice, 1495‚Äì98, from a single corrupt manuscript which has since been lost. Wimmer identified two manuscripts of first quality, the Codex Urbinas in the Vatican Library, which was not made known to Johann Gottlob Schneider, who with H. F. Link made the first modern critical edition, Leipzig 1818‚Äì1821, and the excerpts in the Codex Parisiensis in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.Hort, 1916. Introduction, page ix A good and often-cited edition is that of Johannes Bodaeus, published in Amsterdam in 1644. This folio edition has the Greek and Latin texts printed in parallel, along with commentaries on the text by Julius Caesar Scaliger and Robert Constantine, and woodcut illustrations of plants. Sir William Thiselton-Dyer described the commentary as \\"botanically monumental and fundamental\\".Hort, 1916. Introduction, page xii The first translation into English, with an introduction and parallel Greek and English texts, was made by Sir Arthur Hort (1864‚Äì1935). It was published simultaneously by William Heinemann in London and G. P. Putnam's Sons in New York, as a two-volume book Theophrastus Enquiry into Plants and minor works on odours and weather signs in 1916. Three older German editions with commentaries are described by Hort as indispensable: Schneider and Link's 1818‚Äì1821 edition already mentioned; Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel's 1822 edition from Halle; and Christian Friedrich Heinrich Wimmer's 1842 edition from Breslau.Hort, 1916. Introduction, pages xiii‚Äìxiv Contents Enquiry into Plants classifies plants according to how they reproduce, their localities, their sizes, and their practical uses including as foods, juices, and herbs.\\"Theophrastus\\" entry in the Penny Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, edited by George Long, (1842), Volume 24, pages 332‚Äì4 The books describe the natural history of plants as follows:Sengbusch, 2014 =Book 1: Plant anatomy= Theophrastus tours plant anatomy, including leaves (phylla), flowers, catkins, fruits (karpoi), seeds, roots (rhizai), and wood. Plants are classified as trees, shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annual herbs (poai); these divisions are acknowledged to be rough and ready, as is the division into wild or cultivated, whereas the aquatic/terrestrial division appeared to be natural. Theophrastus notes that some plants are irregular, while the silver fir has branches always opposite each other and other plants have branches equally spaced or in rows. Figs have the longest roots, while the banyan sends roots down from the shoots, forming a circle of roots at a distance all round the trunk. =Book 2: Tree and plant propagation= Boy in Sudan with date palm spathe for artificial pollination, as described by Theophrastus Theophrastus writes that plants can grow spontaneously, from seed, or from vegetative parts of the plant. Plants with bulbs grow from those. Soil and climate influence growth. Some plants change into others unless care is taken, so bergamot turns into mint, and wheat turns into darnel. He reports that if celery is trodden after sowing, it will become curly, and that figs are the easiest trees to propagate, whereas date palms have to be grown from several seeds together, and they like irrigation, dung, salt (at the age of one year) and being transplanted. Other kinds of palm have different habits and fruits. He notes that gall insects come out of wild figs and make the cultivated figs swell, which helps to prevent premature shedding of the fruit. The male spathe of the date palm is cut off and brought to the female, and its dust is shaken over the female tree to make it fruit.Index of Plants p. 437 =Book 3: Wild trees= Theophrastus asserts that all wild trees grow from seed or from roots. He mentions that the philosophers spoke of spontaneous generation, as when Anaxagoras claims the air contains the seeds of every plant, whereas Diogenes believed plants arose when water mixed with earth. In places like Crete, Theophrastus writes that native plants spring up if the ground is simply disturbed, and that wild trees are generally more vigorous than cultivated ones, give fruit later, and like cold and hilly terrain. He asserts that trees which can grow both on hill and plain grow better and taller when grown on the plain. The book offers numerous examples of Theophrastus's note-like style, with lists of species interspersed among the general explanations. For example, \\"Now among wild trees those are evergreen which were mentioned before, silver-fir fir 'wild pine' box andrachne yew Phoenician cedar terebinth alaternus hybrid arbutus bay holm-oak holly cotoneaster kermes-oak tamarisk; but all the others shed their leaves ...\\"Hort, 1916. p173 (3. III. 1-3) =Book 4: Trees and shrubs from abroad= Theophrastus describes trees and shrubs from different places and habitats, as for instance a sheltered part of the Arcadia region near Krane in a deep valley where the sun never reaches, and the silver-fir trees are exceptionally tall. He looks into the plants of Egypt, Libya, Asia, northern regions, and then aquatic plants from the Mediterranean, wetlands especially in Egypt, reeds and rushes. He also considers factors that limit the life of plants including diseases and weather damage. =Book 5: Wood= Aleppo pines, like these at ancient Olympia, yielded wood suitable for shipbuilding, according to Theophrastus in Book 5. Theophrastus describes the wood of different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, and the making of charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship. =Book 6: Undershrubs, with thorns or without= Theophrastus classifies undershrubs as spiny, such as thistle, eryngo and safflower, and spineless, such as marjoram, savory, sage, horehound, and balm. He notes that some have a hollow stem, such as deadly nightshade and hemlock. Roses, he writes, vary in number of petals, roughness of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of flowering of different species are listed. =Book 7: Pot-herbs= Theophrastus reports that cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, purslane and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but wait for the right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts out a series of flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating. =Book 8: Cereals and legumes= Theophrastus groups together the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These can only be grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower for four or five days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow as big as the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent. =Book 9: Medicinal uses of plants= Resin being collected by tapping a pine tree This book is one of the first herbals, admittedly much simpler than those of Nicander, Dioscorides or Galen.Scarborough, 1978. Theophrastus covers juices (chylismos), gums, and resins, the uses of some hundreds of plants as medicines, and how to gather them. Resin is gathered by tapping trees including silver-fir and Aleppo pine; the best resin is from the terebinth. On Mount Ida in Crete the people gather pitch from Corsican pine and Aleppo pine. Gums such as frankincense, myrrh and balsam of Mecca are gathered either by cutting the plant or naturally. Frankincense and myrrh are gathered into the closely guarded temple of the Sabaeans. Cassia and cinnamon also come from the Arabian peninsula. Drug collectors have certain traditions which may be accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly the idea that you must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched. Apart from Greece itself, medicinal plants are produced in Italy in Tyrrhenia, as Aeschylus records, and Latium; and in Egypt, which as Homer mentions is the source of the drug nepenthes that makes men forget sorrow and passion. The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus. Reception =Ancient= Pliny the Elder made frequent use of Theophrastus, including his books on plants, in his Natural History; the only authors he cited more often were Democritus and Varro. John Scarborough comments that \\"The list of herbals assembled in Historia Plantarum IX became the direct ancestor of all later drug treatises in antiquity, and many traces of Theophrastus's (and Diocles's) original observations survive in the Materia Medica of Dioscorides. The analysis of the various plants and plant derivatives shows that the Greek rhizotomoi and drug-vendors had collected much valuable information on the medical employment of plants, and Theophrastus invented a format for this type of information that would be followed after his own time.\\" =Mediaeval and Renaissance= Andrea Cesalpino's 1583 De Plantis made use of Historia Plantarum. Theophrastus was barely known to western Europe in the Middle Ages; his writings were popularized there only in the 15th century,Schmitt, 1971. when Greek manuscripts in the Vatican, possibly, like many other ancient Vatican Greek manuscripts, brought from the Byzantine Empire during its fall to the Ottomans in the 15th century, were translated into Latin by the Byzantine Greek refugee Theodorus Gaza at the request of pope Nicholas V. The effect was to stimulate Renaissance scholars to restart the exploration of plant taxonomy. The science of botany was founded as these scholars engaged with the accounts of plants, and especially of their medicinal uses, together with a newly critical reaction to mediaeval pharmacology, which was based on unthinking acceptance of the Natural History of Pliny the Elder and the De Materia Medica of Dioscorides.Grafton, 2010. p146 By the same token, however, Theophrastus (and Aristotle) fell abruptly out of use around 1550, as classical botany and zoology were effectively assimilated into Renaissance thought in the form of illustrated encyclopedias‚Äîwhich were still heavily based on classical writings.Grafton, 2010. p626 Andrea Cesalpino made use of Theophrastus in his philosophical book on plants, De Plantis (1583). The Italian scholar Julius Caesar Scaliger's accurate and detailed commentaries on the Historia Plantarum were published in Leyden in 1584, after his death.Hort, 1916. Introduction, page xv =Modern= The Chicago Botanic Garden describes Historia Plantarum as the \\"first great botanical work\\" of Theophrastus, \\"the first real botanist\\"; it states of the 1483 edition printed by Bartolomeo Confalonieri in Treviso that \\"all taxonomy of plants starts with this modest book\\", centuries before the modern taxonomy of Linnaeus. Anna Pavord observes in her 2005 book The Naming of Names that Theophrastus made the first ever classification of plants, and Pliny the Elder, now much better known, used much of his material.

It was released on May 15, 2014 for the PlayStation 3. The story in One For All is told from the perspective of a producer in charge of leading and training a group of pop idols to stardom. Its gameplay, while most similar to its predecessor The Idolmaster 2, features several improvements and differences, and allows players to produce all 13 idols from 765 Production, the main talent agency featured in the series. Planning for the game centered on the use of \\"all for one and one for all\\" as the game's theme. The office environment was redesigned to give it a more natural feeling, and a focus was put on \\"returning to the starting point\\" in The Idolmaster series with One For All centered on growing alongside novice idols in a small talent agency. One For All sold 83,395 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the best-selling video game in Japan that week. Gameplay The Idolmaster One For All is a raising simulation game in which the player assumes the role of a producer who works at 765 Production (765 Pro), a talent agency that represents 13 pop idols who recently made their debuts but have yet to make an impact in the industry. At the beginning of the game, the player meets Junjir≈ç Takagi, 765 Pro's president, and is tasked with initially choosing to produce one of the agency's idols: Haruka Amami, Chihaya Kisaragi, Yukiho Hagiwara, Yayoi Takatsuki, Ritsuko Akizuki, Azusa Miura, Iori Minase, Makoto Kikuchi, Ami and Mami Futami, Miki Hoshii, Hibiki Ganaha, and Takane Shijou. The player and the selected idol are also tasked by Takagi to satisfy objectives over the course of 12-week long seasons, the first of which is spring. By the fourth week, the player is allowed to produce three idols together as an idol unit. Satisfying an objective by the end of a given season will increase the player's producer rank, which allows the player to produce additional idols and have access to more songs, among other features. The unit's vocal, dance, and visual competency is represented by three statistic points called image points. Each idol's level is tied to her experience points, but this is unrelated to an idol's individual rank. An idol earns experience points from doing promotional work or stage performances. The game depicts the idols' activities of each in- game week. At the beginning of each week, the player organizes the idols' schedule, which includes activities such as lessons, consultations, promotional work, stage performances and shopping for costumes and accessories. Each activity costs and reimburses the player varying amounts of in-game money, though only the promotional work or stage performances will result in the end an in-game week. The lessons are instructional sessions that idols partake to temporarily raise their image points for one in-game week, and are in the form of three minigames. Each lesson type corresponds to one of the three image categories: vocal, dance, and visual. Each lesson is timed, and the idols' overall performance in the lesson is ranked as bad, normal, good, or perfect. During consultations, the player is given multiple responses to choose from over the course of a conversation with an idol. The player's choices affect how well or poorly the communication is received‚Äîranging from bad to normal, good, and perfect communication, and this in turn affects the idol's memory count. This communication aspect is also featured during promotional work, which are jobs that the producer and the idols can take to further their popularity in specific regions. The jobs can either compensate or cost the unit with in-game money, and earn the idols differing numbers of fans in the region the job is conducted in. The player can also shop for additional costumes and accessories. In addition to the auditions found in previous Idolmaster simulation games, the idols can also perform by participating in music festivals and live performances. These three types of performances are together referred to as stage performances, and share the same basic gameplay with differences in their conditions of completion. To successfully pass an audition, the player and idols must receive a passing ranking among the auditioning units, while a predetermined rating representing the audience's excitement must be achieved to successfully complete a live performance. In a festival, the player and idols compete against a computer- controlled opponent, and must obtain a higher score than the opponent to successfully complete the festival. Similar to games in the rhythm genre, stage performances' gameplay takes place as the player listens to the idols performing a song. During the performance, the player must guide the idols to appeal to the judge or audience in the three image categories by continuously pressing buttons that correspond to the categories along to the rhythm of the song. The player and the idols are scored by the accuracy of these presses in timing, for which he or she is given one of four ratings: Perfect, Good, Normal, and Bad. The points that each appeal rewards is dependent on the idols' statistics and the song's tempo. The points of each appeal are also multiplied by the category's interest rate, which represents the audience's interest in the image category and increases or decreases as the idols continue to appeal in other categories or the same category. The idols' performance are also represented by the voltage meter, which increases as the player successfully hits a note. The player also has the option to use memory appeals to reset each image's interest rate and receive a boost in the score and voltage. The player can use as many memory appeals as the idols' memory count. Once the voltage meter is completely filled, the player can choose an idol to activate a burst appeal. During a burst appeal, the player must follow a sequence of specific image appeals, which are given an adjusted, higher than average interest rate. This also halts the opponent's ability to use appeals, and causes a reduction in his or her voltage meter. After the burst appeal, the voltage meter is reset, and the voltage meter must be filled again before another burst can be used. Special items called amulets can also be purchased and used to adjust gameplay elements, such as reducing the interest rates' deterioration rate. If the idols pass an audition, the unit is chosen to do a televised performance of the song previously chosen, while an encore is given if a festival or live performance is successfully completed. The performances serve to increase the number of fans the unit has in the region it is held or in all regions in the case of national broadcasts. In addition to the normal live performances, all 13 idols hold an All Star Live concert at the end of the summer and winter seasons. The idols are split into three groups, two groups of five and one group of three, and if successfully completed, a pre- rendered encore performance is shown featuring a different song and costumes. If necessary conditions are met, the player is also allowed to take part in a Rank Up festival with the intention of increasing an idol's rank. While fundamentally similar to the normal festivals, the player must defeat the opponent twice using two different songs to successfully complete the festival. Once an idol achieves an idol rank of A3 or above, the player is allowed to take part in the Idol Extreme music festival; the highest idol rank is A1. Whenever an idol's level or idol rank increases, they receive skill points, which can be used to augment an idol's abilities by choosing from available skills on the skill board. This includes such actions as raising vocal, dance and visual parameters, increasing the speed at which the voltage meter is filled, and strengthening the effect of memory appeals. Development and release The Idolmaster One For All was developed by Bandai Namco Games and directed by Akihiro Ishihara and Munehiro Koyanagi. Bandai Namco Games producer Y≈çz≈ç Sakagami explains that planning for the game began with the decision to use \\"all for one and one for all\\" as the game's theme. In doing so, he wanted to put more of a focus on the 765 Production (765 Pro) headquarters, especially after hearing comments from fans who found it relaxing to watch the idols talk among themselves at the 765 Pro office. This led to the office environment to be redesigned to give it a more natural feeling. The game's opening menu screen also features the 765 Pro office to further immerse the player in the game's atmosphere. The development team attempted to focus on \\"returning to the starting point\\" in The Idolmaster series with One For All. Sakagami explains that the true charm of The Idolmaster is to grow alongside novice idols centered on a small talent agency, and he goes on to say that the direction One For All took was in depicting the \\"warmth\\" that goes along with \\"765 Pro as the starting point\\". The gameplay in One For All was changed from previous Idolmaster installments to remove the restriction of only allowing the player to produce a given idol or idol unit for a period of one year, which is something Sakagami admits he had wanted to do something about for quite some time. Compared to the gameplay in The Idolmaster 2 which is noted as not allowing the player much room to view the promotional work or communication aspects of the game, Sakagami wanted to design a game where players could take their time and take various detours throughout the game. Sakagami goes on to say that he wanted to remove the one year time limitation because of his strong desire to allow players the chance to produce the idols until they would be satisfied. Another focus for Sakagami was the desire for players to experience all of the idols instead of just their favorites, so the gameplay was adjusted to only allow the player to choose one of the 13 available idols to produce at the beginning of the game. Via more idols becoming available to produce as gameplay continues, Sakagami had the idea to let the player experience the fun of producing an idol group as it gradually grows and develops. In wanting to adopt a factor directly tied to an idol's growth, One For All was designed to show the amount of experience points earned from the idols doing jobs such as promotional work, auditions and live performances. One For All also introduces a skill board system, which gives skill points to idols whenever they level up. The idea for this system is derived from the use of amulets in The Idolmaster 2 which adjust gameplay elements, and skill points work in a similar fashion. Sakagami also wanted to better convey the personal growth of the producer, leading to the creation of the season objective system, which grants the player additional functionality such as new songs or the ability to produce more idols simultaneously. Despite the new additions to the gameplay system, Sakagami believes the gameplay itself is simple enough that new fans to The Idolmaster series will still be able to enjoy it. One For All was released by Bandai Namco Games in Japan for the PlayStation 3 on May 15, 2014 in limited and regular editions, as well as for download through the PlayStation Store. The limited edition release comes in a specially made box containing the game itself, a drama CD, a product code to obtain original costumes as downloadable content (DLC), a business pamphlet for the 765 Pro idols, a 765 Pro calendar, a cleaning cloth featuring aphorisms from 765 Pro's president Junjir≈ç Takagi, 13 posters featuring the 765 Pro idols, and two serial numbers to obtain one rare card each for use in the social network games The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls and The Idolmaster Million Live!. Bandai Namco Games began releasing DLC updates on May 15, 2014 available through the PlayStation Store. The updates include things such as new songs, costumes, accessories, and special guest idols who perform songs in the Stage For You game mode. One For All features 21 songs written and composed by a variety of songwriters. As of September 2014, an additional 34 songs were released in DLC packs. Three songs were originally introduced in One For All: , \\"Destiny\\" and \\"Only My Note\\". However, \\"Acceleration\\" is limited to being sung by the rival idol Leon. The songs were released on an album titled The Idolmaster Master Artist 3: Only My Note on August 27, 2014, which also includes songs released in DLC packs. Reception One For All sold 83,395 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the best-selling video game in Japan that week. The Mainichi Shimbun reported that one day after the game's release, both the limited and regular editions were already sold out of stores in Akihabara. Within the first week, the game sold through 92.56% of its initial shipment. By June 1, 2014, the game had sold 102,793 copies. The game received a score of 33 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu.

It was opened in 1925 and is managed by the Houston Parks Department. It was the site of the Moody Park riots in 1978. History The City of Houston purchased about 120 lots in 1923 for $18,000 and an additional 6 lots later that year from the Cetti family estate for $8,000, and began construction of the park. It was opened in 1925 and named for Alvin S. Moody, a local Democratic politician. The city added amenities to the park incrementally as funding allowed. By 1939, the park contained a small gymnasium and meeting rooms. A public swimming pool was installed in 1953 and the baseball diamonds were added from the 1940s through 1977. Sculptor Luis A. Jimenez‚Äôs fiberglass installation ‚ÄúThe Vaquero‚Äù was erected in 1978. On May 7, 1978, the Moody Park riots took place at the park. They began as a series of protests against the police murder of Jose Campos Torres, a Mexican-American who was arrested by police under dubious cause and killed while in custody. The protests turned to riot and led to more than forty arrests, a dozen hospitalizations, and hundreds of thousands of dollars of property damage to businesses and police vehicles. The aftermath resulted in a continuation of already strained police relations and a mistrust of police by the Hispanic community of Houston. It also led to significant police reforms. In 1986, the community center was rebuilt. The new one was designed by architect W. Jackson Wisdom, and was constructed for $1,055,100. In 2014, a 7,000-square foot addition was added with additional renovations throughout the park. In 2013, construction of the expanded METRORail red line began, with operations beginning on December 21, 2013. Moody Park Station is located at the park.

Biography  = Early career = Fars and its surrounding regions in the 9th‚Äì10th centuries Unlike the majority of the Buyid viziers, Bahram bore an Iranian name, and his father also had an Iranian name which was an Arabicized form of Mah-panah. Bahram was born at Kazerun in Fars in 976/7, and when he became older, he began serving the Buyids as a secretary, and later rose to higher offices, eventually in the 1020s becoming the adviser of the Buyid vizier Ibn Makram. In 1024, the Buyid ruler of Fars, Sultan al- Dawla, died, and a succession crisis shortly occurred; His son Qawam al-Dawla, the governor of Kerman, who claimed Fars for himself, rebelled against his own brother Abu Kalijar. Nevertheless, Abu Kalijar managed to gain control over Fars, and successfully defended his domains against his brother. = Vizierate = However, during the conflict his vizier Ibn Makram was killed, and Bahram was shortly appointed by Abu Kalijar as his new vizier. During his period as a vizier, Bahram's prominent talents as a general and an administrator, and tolerance against other religions, made him famous among the subjects of the Buyid state. He also had good relations with the Ismaili missionary Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi. In 1028, Qawam al-Dawla was poisoned, and Abu Kalijar shortly conquered Kerman. In 1030, another rival and relative of Abu Kalijar, Jalal al-Dawla, sent a fleet of 1300 ships under his vizier Abu Ali Hasan to capture Basra from Abu Kalijar, but the expedition eventually proved to be an disaster and ended in a complete defeat for Jalal al-Dawla. Abu Ali Hasan was then taken prisoner, but was soon released. Abu Kalijar shortly sent an army under Bahram, who managed to conquer Khuzistan. Abu Kalijar then made Ahvaz his capital. In 1033 the Ghaznavids invaded Kerman, with the object of overrunning the Buyid states. However, the financial obligations imposed on the people of Kerman convinced them that Buyid rule would be preferable. In the following year, Bahram ibn Mafinna expelled the Ghaznavids from the province. In 1037/8, a civil war broke in Oman between the princes of the local vassal dynasty in the region. Bahram shortly interfered in the civil war, and brought peace to the region. Bahram later died in 1041/2, and was succeeded by Dhu'l-Sa'adat as the vizier of Abu Kalijar. According to the historian Hugh N. Kennedy, Bahram was the last great vizier of the Buyids.

The negotiations ‚Äì focused on obtaining a ceasefire and establishing a prisoner exchange ‚Äì were conducted during the Axis Case White offensive. They were used by the Partisans to delay the Axis forces while the Partisans crossed the Neretva River, and to allow the Partisans to focus on attacking their Chetnik rivals led by Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá. The negotiations were accompanied by an informal ceasefire that lasted about six weeks before being called off on orders from Adolf Hitler. The short-term advantage gained by the Partisans through the negotiations was lost when the Axis Case Black offensive was launched in mid-May 1943. Prisoner exchanges, which had been occurring between the Germans and Partisans for some months prior, re-commenced in late 1943 and continued until the end of the war. Details of the negotiations were little known by historians until the 1970s, despite being mentioned by several authors from 1949 on. The key Partisan negotiator, Milovan ƒêilas, was first named in Walter Roberts' Tito, Mihailoviƒá, and the Allies, 1941‚Äì1945 in 1973. Roberts' book was met with protests from the Yugoslav government of Josip Broz Tito. The objections centred on claims that Roberts was effectively equating the German‚ÄìPartisan negotiations with the collaboration agreements concluded by various Chetnik leaders with the Italians and Germans during the war. Roberts denied this, but added that the book did not accept the mythology of the Partisans as a \\"liberation movement\\" or the Chetniks as \\"traitorous collaborators\\". Subsequently, accounts of the negotiations were published by Yugoslav historians and the main Yugoslav protagonists.  Background  In August 1942, during the Partisan Long March west through the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH), Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav Partisans captured a group of eight Germans from the civil and military engineering group Organisation Todt near Livno. The leader of the captured group was a mining engineer, Hans Ott, who was also an officer of the Abwehr, the Wehrmacht's intelligence organisation. The captured group had been identifying new sources of metal and timber for the Germans, but Ott had also been tasked by the Abwehr with making contact with the Partisans. Following their capture, Ott told his captors that he had an important message to deliver to Partisan headquarters, and after he had been taken there he suggested to the Partisans that his group be exchanged for Partisans held by the Germans in jails in Zagreb. On that basis, Ott was sent to Zagreb on parole, where he met with the German Plenipotentiary General in Croatia, (Lieutenant General) Edmund Glaise-Horstenau. He advised Glaise- Horstenau that Tito was willing to exchange the eight Germans for ten Partisans who were being held by the Germans, Italians and NDH authorities. Glaise-Horstenau contacted the commander of the Italian 2nd Army, Generale designato d'Armata (acting General) Mario Roatta, who had most of the identified Partisan prisoners in his custody. On 14 August, the German ambassador to the NDH, SA-Obergruppenf√ºhrer (Lieutenant General) Siegfried Kasche, sent a telegram to the Reich Foreign Ministry advising of the proposed exchange and asked the Ministry to intercede with the Italians. In his book Tito, Mihailoviƒá, and the Allies, 1941‚Äì1945, published in 1973, the former US diplomat Walter Roberts argued that the Abwehr considered some sort of modus vivendi with the Partisans might be possible, and were thinking of more than prisoner exchanges when they gave Ott the task of making contact with the Partisans. The number of Germans in Partisan custody had been increasing, and this made some sort of prisoner swap agreement more likely. These agreements were initially led by Marijan Stilinoviƒá on behalf of the Partisan Supreme Headquarters. On 5 September, a prisoner swap was completed in an area between Duvno and Livno, where 38 Partisans and family members were exchanged for one senior German officer who had been captured during the Battle of Livno in December 1942. Continuing negotiations between the Germans and Partisan headquarters resulted in a further prisoner exchange on 17 November 1942. The second of these was negotiated by Stilinoviƒá and Vladimir Velebit, also a member of the Partisan Supreme Headquarters, and Ott was involved on the German side. On the day of the second prisoner exchange, the Partisans delivered a letter addressed to Glaise-Horstenau which apparently explained that the Partisans were \\"an independent armed force with military discipline and not an agglomeration of bands\\", and \\"proposed mutual application of the rules of international law, especially in regard to prisoners and wounded, a regular exchange of prisoners, and a sort of armistice between the two sides\\". Glaise-Horstenau, Kasche and others wanted to continue exchanging prisoners as a means of obtaining intelligence, and also wanted a modus vivendi with the Partisans to allow the Germans to exploit the mineral resources of the NDH without disruption. In particular, they wanted to minimise disruption in the NDH south of the Sava River and on the Zagreb‚ÄìBelgrade railway line. Adolf Hitler and Reich Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop were opposed to a modus vivendi, as they were afraid it would give the Partisans the status of a regular belligerent. As a result of Hitler's opposition, this Partisan proposal was not answered.  March negotiations  Partisans with captured German major Arthur Strecker, who was offered in exchange for captured partisans. From 20 January 1943, the Partisans had been hard-pressed by the Axis Case White offensive. Throughout that offensive, Partisan Supreme Headquarters engaged the Germans in negotiations to gain time to cross the Neretva River. In late February or early March 1943, the Partisans captured a German officer and about 25 soldiers, who joined about 100 Croatian Home Guards, and 15 Italian officers and 600 soldiers already being held as prisoners of war by the Partisans. Due to their desperate situation at this stage of Case White, and their need to delay the Axis in order to cross the Neretva river before the Germans struck, they decided to use the recently captured German officer to initiate negotiations. The German historians Ladislaus Hory and Martin Broszat concluded that at this critical period, Tito was also concerned that by the end of the war the attrition to his Partisan forces would be such that Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks would be more powerful. They suggest that Tito may have been willing to agree to a truce with the Germans in order to destroy the Chetniks. alt=A black-and-white head and shoulders left profile photograph of a male with dark hair The negotiations commenced on 11 March 1943 in Gornji Vakuf. According to the historian Jozo Tomasevich, the three Partisans tasked with the negotiations show the importance that the Partisans placed on the outcome. They were: Koƒça Popoviƒá, Spanish Civil War veteran and commander of the 1st Proletarian Division; Milovan ƒêilas, a member of the Partisan Supreme Headquarters and member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (using the alias of Milo≈° Markoviƒá); and Velebit (using the alias of Dr. Vladimir Petroviƒá). The German negotiators were led by the commander of the 717th Infantry Division Generalleutnant (Major General) Benignus Dippold, one of his staff officers and a Hitler Youth representative. In their written statement, the Partisans: * identified their prisoners and indicated who they wanted in exchange, emphasising that they wanted to complete the exchange as soon as possible; * said that if the Germans accepted the Partisan proposal, especially in regard to the wounded and captured, the Partisans would reciprocate; * stated that Partisan Supreme Headquarters believed that, given the circumstances, there was no reason for the Germans to attack the Partisans, and it would be in the interests of both if hostilities stopped and areas of responsibilities were agreed; * stated that they considered the Chetniks their main enemies; * proposed that an armistice should apply during the negotiations; and * required a signature from their higher headquarters on any final agreement. Popoviƒá returned to report to Tito, and the Wehrmacht Commander South-East Generaloberst (Senior General) Alexander L√∂hr approved an informal ceasefire while the talks continued. On 17 March, Kasche reported on the negotiations to the Reich Foreign Ministry, requesting approval to continue discussions, and asking for instructions. The following is an extract from Kasche's telegram: alt=A blonde-haired male wearing a dark Nazi Party uniform with swastika armband seated at a desk According to Roberts, it is clear that the next phase of negotiations was intended to go beyond prisoner exchanges, as the prisoner of war negotiator Stilinoviƒá was not involved. ƒêilas and Velebit were passed through the German lines to Sarajevo and were then flown to Zagreb on 25 March in a military aircraft. These negotiations were with German representatives supervised by Ott, apparently on all the points discussed at Gornji Vakuf, and the Partisans made it clear to the Germans that their proposals did not amount to an offer of surrender. Velebit met personally with Glaise-Horstenau, as the Austrian had known Velebit's father, a Yugoslav general. After this first visit to Zagreb, Velebit visited Partisan commanders in Slavonia and eastern Bosnia passing on orders for the suspension of attacks on the Germans and their rail communications, and the release of prisoners. Kasche had not received a reply to his telegram of 17 March, so he sent a further telegram to von Ribbentrop on 26 March. In it he advised that two Partisan representatives had arrived in Zagreb for negotiations, and named them using their aliases. He pointed out that the Partisan interest in an armistice had increased, and emphasised that he considered this a significant development. By this time, ƒêilas and Velebit had returned to Zagreb, where they reiterated that the Partisans wanted recognition as a regular belligerent, and emphasised the futility of continued fighting. They effectively asked to be left alone to fight the Chetniks. According to Pavlowitch, it is not clear which side posed the question of what the Partisans would do if the British were to land in Yugoslavia without Partisan authorisation. ƒêilas and Velebit said they would fight them as well as the Germans. They stated that their propaganda had been slanted towards the Soviet Union because they did not want to communicate with London. Their determination to fight the British if they landed was because they believed that the British would try to thwart their objective of seizing power in Yugoslavia. The Partisans also believed that the British were clandestine supporters of Chetnik collaboration. ƒêilas and Velebit further stated that the Chetniks would not fight the British because such a landing was exactly what they were waiting for. Von Ribbentrop responded on 29 March, prohibiting all further contact with the Partisans and inquiring about what evidence Kasche had gathered to support his optimistic conclusions. When told of the talks with the Partisans, Hitler apparently responded, \\"One does not negotiate with rebels‚Äîrebels must be shot\\". On 31 March, Kasche responded with a further telegram, saying that there had been no direct contact with Tito, and contradicted his earlier telegram by stating that the contacts had been strictly about prisoner exchanges. Kasche stated that Tito had abided by his promises thus far, and: Kasche further stated that it would be useful from a military perspective if the Partisans were allowed to fight the Chetniks without German interference, and counselled against trying to fight the Partisans and the Chetniks at the same time. On 30 March, ƒêilas had returned to Partisan headquarters with 12 more Partisans that had been held in the Usta≈°e-run Jasenovac concentration camp. Velebit remained in Zagreb to complete a further task: he successfully arranged the release of a detained Slovenian communist, Herta Haas, who was Tito's wife and the mother of his two-year-old son, Aleksandar.  Reaction and aftermath  Mihailoviƒá was the first to receive reports of contact between the Germans and Partisans, and passed them on to his British Special Operations Executive liaison officer, Colonel Bill Bailey. When Bailey's report arrived in London on 22 March, it was not taken seriously. Italian military intelligence also became aware of the talks. Tito himself mentioned the prisoner exchanges to the Comintern in Moscow, but when they realised more was being discussed and demanded an explanation, Tito was taken aback. He responded that he was not getting any external support, and needed to look after the interests of captured Partisans and refugees. German‚ÄìPartisan prisoner exchanges re-commenced in late 1943, but became the responsibility of the Partisan Chief Headquarters for Croatia rather than Partisan Supreme Headquarters. Initially these were organised by Stilinoviƒá, then by Dr. Josip Brnƒçiƒá, before Boris Bakraƒç took over the role. Between March 1944 and May 1945, Bakraƒç attended about 40 meetings with German representatives, 25 of which were in Zagreb under agreements for safe conduct. On the German side, Ott continued to play a leading role. These negotiations resulted in the exchange of between 600 and 800 Partisans in total.  Historiography  Walter Roberts broadcasting on alt=Black and white photograph of a male wearing glasses and standing next to a microphone The negotiations were first mentioned publicly in 1949 when Stephen Clissold published his Whirlwind: An Account of Marshal Tito's Rise to Power. This was closely followed by Wilhelm H√∂ttl's Die Geheime Front, Organisation, Personen und Aktionen des deutschen Geheimdienstes (The Secret Front, the Organisation, People and Activities of the German Secret Service) in 1950. There was another mention in a book published in German in 1956, Generalmajor Rudolf Kiszling's Die Kroaten. Der Schicksalsweg eines S√ºdslawenvolkes (The Croats: The Fateful Path of the South Slav People). Ilija Jukiƒá obtained evidence from German Foreign Ministry sources, which he included in his 1965 book Pogledi na pro≈°lost, sada≈°njost i buduƒánost hrvatskog narodna (Views on the Past, Present and Future of the Croatian Nation), published in London. In 1967, the Yugoslav historian Mi≈°o Lekoviƒá was officially commissioned to produce a full report on the talks. In 1969, Ivan Avakumoviƒá published his Mihailoviƒá prema nemaƒçkim dokumentima (Mihailoviƒá according to German documents), which used captured German military documents. In 1973, Roberts published Tito, Mihailoviƒá, and the Allies, 1941‚Äì1945 which included information about the German‚ÄìPartisan negotiations of March 1943. The publishing of the book disturbed the Yugoslav government, which lodged a complaint with the US Department of State. The thrust of the Yugoslav complaint was that the book equated the Partisans with the Chetniks. Roberts denied this, stating that his book did not equate the two or accept the Partisan mythology of the Partisans as a \\"liberation movement\\" or the Chetniks as \\"traitorous collaborators\\". The book also identified ƒêilas as the main negotiator. In 1977, ƒêilas confirmed his involvement in his book Wartime, but stated that he would not have disclosed the details of the negotiations if it had not already been known through Roberts' book. In 1978, Tito admitted that the negotiations occurred, but characterised their purpose as \\"solely to obtain German recognition of belligerent status for the Partisans\\". In 1985, after Tito's death, Lekoviƒá was able to publish the results of his investigation that had started in 1967, in Martovski pregovori 1943 (The March Negotiations 1943). In 1989, Popoviƒá gave his version of events in Aleksandar Nenadoviƒá's Razgovori s Koƒçom (Conversations with Koƒça), followed by Velebit in Mira ≈†uvar's Vladimir Velebit: svjedok historije (Vladimir Velebit: Witness to History) in 2001, and in his own Tajne i zamke Drugog svjetskog rata (Secrets and Traps of the Second World War) the following year.

The aim of this branch of the US Army Signal Corps was to recruit women to train as wireless operators, in order to replace male wireless operators who had gone to war. The activities of the Corps converged with the wartime wireless activities and training of the National League for Women's Service whose training classes were directed by Owen.  Foundation  The Women's Radio Corps was established during World War One by Edna Owen and an advisory council consisting of many influential figures in the field of wireless communications: Gano Dunn, past president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers; Alfred Goldsmith, co-founder of the Institute of Radio Engineers; Edward J. Nally, vice president and general manager of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America; and Columbia University professor Michael Pupin, then president of the Institute of Radio Engineers. The council was chaired by Owen herself and responsibility for the supply of wireless training apparatus for the WRC fell to Nally's commercial manager, David Sarnoff. A mere six days after the US entered the war in April 1917, Owen offered to provide 500 licensed female wireless operators in six months. In order to achieve this highly ambitious goal, Owen campaigned tirelessly to add recruits, lecturing up to 200 young women at once in lectures in New York and Washington, D.C., on the \\"many wonderful opportunities\\" brought by the occasion of the \\"great world war. . . . [I]t is your duty to prepare yourselves in order that you may set men free, that they may go to the front and fight for you and yours.\\" Members of the Women's Radio Corps took the same courses and received the same wireless licenses from the US Bureau of Navigation as male wireless operators. The first activity of the WRC was to teach wireless classes for drafted men on Long Island. Members of the WRC also served as inspectors of wireless apparatus and worked in the Radio Research and Development section of the US Army Signal Corps.  After the war  With the Armistice declared in November 1918, the WRC was not demobilised but rather changed tack and began training women to work as commercial wireless operators - they believed wireless telegraphy was \\"one of the most important of the many new careers open to women\\" - as the US wireless stations nationalised during the war returned to private ownership. By late 1918, some of the members of the WRC had moved to Washington, D.C., where they joined many other single women in filling in for male workers in government bureaucracies, setting up a boarding house and establishing their headquarters at 2834 14th Street in the Columbia Heights neighbourhood. By January 1919, their membership had dwindled to 21 and it appears the corps was disbanded.

The hill is part of the Haardt mountain range that forms the eastern edge of the Palatinate Forest. At the summit is an ancient circular rampart, now designated as a cultural monument, and the natural monument of the Orensfelsen rocks.  Geographical Location  The summit of the Orensberg, which lies within the Palatine Forest Nature Park, rises within the forest estate belonging to Frankweiler, a village 2.8 kilometres to the southeast; the northern slopes of the hill are part of the woods of B√∂chingen, a settlement 4.7 km east-southeast. Higher mountains and hills nearby include the Ro√überg (637.0 m), 2 km north, and the Teufelsberg (597.6 m), 2.1 km (both as the crow flies) northeast. Three streams flow past the Orensberg: the Dernbach to the west, the Queich to the south and the Hainbach to the east.  History  = Name = The Orensberg used to be called the Urlesberg. This was derived from the Old High German word Urla√ü, which means \\"pasture hill\\" (Weideberg. see also Urnsburg = Excavations = The remains of settlements from the Early Middle Ages have been found on the Orensberg. As a result, archaeological investigations have taken place for a number of years under the direction of Jochen Braselmann. Trial digs were carried out and several working ditches, so-called mardelles, were opened. Finds included flint arrowheads dating to the New Stone Age, as well as pottery from the Early Middle Ages. In addition the former entrance in the interior of the circular rampart was uncovered. = Circular rampart or ringwork = Today little can be seen of the collapsed stone wall that once formed the circular rampart. The rampart is around two and a half kilometres long and encloses an area of about 15 hectares. Early scientific assessments indicated it might be of Celtic origin and it was dated to the period around 500 B. C. In the meantime, it has been shown that it is actually the remains of a Carolingian refuge castle, which was built in the 8th century A.D. This evidence came from a dendrochronological investigation of a piece of an excavated wooden beam. = Opferschale = The so-called Opferschale (\\"sacrifice or offering bowl\\") on one of the rocks is an hollow in the Bunter sandstone, that has been formed by the erosion of rock layers (Karlstal beds, upper rock zone with ball rock horizon) of differing hardness and which bears traces of human activity. This type of feature is common in the Palatine Forest and is locally called a Wasserstein (\\"water rock\\") or Suppensch√ºssel (\\"soup bowl\\"). According to more recent research only the so-called \\"blood channel\\" (Blutrinne) has been added by human hands. It is not possible to date the workings, but they have been classified to the Celtic period.  Sights  The summit plateau, whose highest point is protected by railings, offers a good all-round view of the Palatine Forest and the Upper Rhine Plain to the south. The surrounding area is rich in castles and castle ruins. For example, to the southwest may be seen the imperial castle of Trifels and its two sister fortresses, Anebos and Scharfenberg; on the north slope of the Orensberge is Scharfeneck Castle, behind the Ro√überg mountain is Meistersel Castle, and to the northwest is the castle of Ramburg.  Tourism and sport  Thanks to its views, the Orensberg is a popular destination for ramblers. It is accessible via a dense network of paths and the route to the top is signed. In addition the hill is a take-off point for paragliders and a destination for mountain bikers.

He served as governor of Trois-Rivi√®res from 1703 to 1709. The son of Mathieu de Crisafi and Fran√ßoise de Grimaldi, he was born in Messina in Sicily. Don Antonio Crisafi and his brother Thomas, who had a good military background, as he had become Knight of Malta in 1670, took part in a revolt against Spain in Sicily. The important city of Messina had at that time (1674‚Äì1678) about 100,000 inhabitants and was a dynamic port with a strategic position in the Mediterranean sea. When the senate of Messina decided to revolt against Spain, the Crisafi brothers were among the military leaders organising the defence. In 1675, Messina obtained the military support of France which was in war against Spain, and the Crisafi brothers continued fighting under the orders of the Duke of Vivonne, the commander of the French troops and a noble who was very close to King Louis XIV. Messina was able to resist against Spain and the French fleet was able to win some important naval battles against the combined fleet of Spain and Holland. But, in 1678, Louis XIV concluded the peace of Nimega and Messina was abandoned in the hands of the Spaniards. Antoine and Thomas Crisafy, like a lot of nobles of Messina, had to flee to France, leaving their assets behind. Since that time they changed their name in Crisafy, according to the French pronunciation. Probably thanks to their connection with the Duke of Vivonne, they were received in Versailles and obtained a little pension from the Sun King. They were eventually accused of a complot against France and were imprisoned for a short time at La Bastille, in Paris, before being freed as they were found to be innocent. Then, in April 1684, Louis XIV decided to name them captains and each led a company of the seven that were sent to New France in that year. Despite their difficulty to adapt to the Canadian cold climate, they were among the most brave and capable officers in Canada as confirmed in several letters sent by the Governors of New France to Versailles. In Canada, the Crisafy brothers had the chance to meet Henry de Tonty, the officer of Italian origins whose name is linked to Cavelier de la Salle in the exploration of the Mississippi river and the land of the Indian Illinois. In 1686, they took part with governor de Denonville in the expedition against the Iroquois at Niagara. In 1692, Antoine was given charge of the troops at Sault-Saint-Louis and was able to fend off an attack by 800 Iroquois. In 1696, Thomas died, leaving a very good memory for his personal qualities. Very close to Governor de Calliere, Antoine Crisafy was named king's lieutenant at Montreal in 1697 and, the following year, appointed Knight of the Order of Saint-Louis. In 1699, he was named king's lieutenant at Quebec City. He married Marie-Claire, the daughter of Fran√ßois-Madeleine-Fortun√© Ruette d'Auteuil de Monceaux in 1700. Following the death of Fran√ßois Provost, he became governor at Trois-Rivi√®res. Crisafy died in office and was buried there on May 6, 1709. Neither Antoine nor Thomas had children and they did not become French citizens.

The trams were originally long and wide. They featured wooden benches in the longitudinal direction seating twenty. The motor cars had two motors providing a combined power output of . The motor cars weighed , while the trailers weighed . Ownership of the class moved to Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS) in 1904, when it bought KKS. The trams were variously rebuilt from 1918. One was converted to a snow plow, while three motor cars and three trailers were converted to cargo trams for hauling grain. The remaining units were rebuilt and lengthened in 1919 and 1920. The wheelbase was extended from and the platform bays covered. A further rebuilding took place between 1921 and 1925, when they received new motors and undercarriages from Siemens Schuckertwerke. They passed on to Oslo Sporveier when it took over KSS in 1924. There the trams remained in service until 1967. __TOC__ History Trailer no. 255 Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie was the third street tram operator in Oslo and the first to be owned by the municipality. The municipal council voted on 23 September 1897 to establish the company, which was issued the task of building three lines: Sagene Ring, the Rodel√∏kka Line and the Vippetangen Line. These lines opened in intervals in 1899 and 1900. Two city engineers were sent on a study tour of Germany and the Netherlands to gain experience from tram operations there. KKS placed its order with Schuckert & Co. of N√ºrnburg and Busch, consisting of twenty motor cars and twelve trailers. All 32 units were delivered in 1899. Schuckert had recently delivered the first trams to Holmenkolbanen (HkB), which operated a suburban tramway in Oslo. However, KKS opted for larger trams than HkB, ordering trams of the same size as those operated by the two other street tram operators, Kristiania Sporveisselskab and Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei (KES). To avoid overlapping numbers with KSS and KES and KSS, the Class S motor units were numbered 201‚Äì220 and the trailers numbered 250‚Äì261. They received a dark red paint scheme and were KKS therefore became known as the \\"Red Trams\\". No. 209 in 1915 after receiving a covered bay The trams were initially used on KKS's three lines. Most services were only run with the motor cars and the trailers were seldom used. Some of the trams were on occasion leased to Holmenkolbanen, who used them on the Holmenkollen Line. The lack of secondary suspension caused complaints from customers who experienced a smoother ride with the trams operated by KSS and KES. KKS was sold to KSS in 1905 and the latter took over all the rolling stock. They were thereafter gradually painted in KSS's green color scheme. The open bays were removed from the motor cars in 1910 and renumbered 48‚Äì67. The trolley was replaced with a pantograph in 1915. With the delivery of the Class SS starting 1914, the older Class S trains became less popular due to their limit size and comfort. However, they were still technically suited for service. Nos. 48, 49 and 66 were converted to trailers in 1916, being renumbered 247‚Äì249. By 1918 the class was removed from regular service. That year no. 57 collided and KSS decided to rebuild it. The body was removed and the undercarriage and motors were used to construct a snowplow unit. The plow itself came out on the side and could be maneuvered from within. This allowed it to plow the tracks and the section from the tracks to the sidewalk. It remained in operation until 1950. No. 57 after it had been converted to a slowplow KKS started a grain tram service in 1918, which linked Statkorn's silo at Vippetangen to Bj√∏lsen Valsem√∏lle. This transport took place using three dedicated trams, which were rebuilt from trams no. 49, 50 and 66. The motors, undercarriage, platforms and frame were reused, while an all-new body were built. In addition, three trailers were converted. The trams had a capacity for of grain and entered service on 27 April 1918, February 1919 and 2 October 1920. A fourth conversion of a motor car to a trailer took place in 1925. The grain trams were retired from in 1932 when two new trams were delivered, although to motor cars and two trailers were kept as reserves. For a period in 1941 and 1942 one tram was leased to B√¶rumsbanen. The last of these were scrapped in 1950. All remaining motor cars were rebuilt in 1919 and 1920, increasing their length. They were further modified at Homansbyen Depot in 1922 and 1923. The bodies were lengthened and axles were kept, but the undercarriages and motors were replaced. The units were renumbered 505‚Äì521 and received motors from Siemens Schuckertwerke, while the undercarriages were built at the depot. Other trams were also given a similar renovation, giving them a similar look. The trams were from then generally known as \\"Municipal HaWa\\". KSS was taken over by Oslo Sporveier in 1924 and in 1927 the Class S trams were renumbered 519‚Äì540. They remained in operation until 28 October 1967. A rebuilt Class S on the Frogner Line during the 1950s The trailers also received a renovation from 1921 to 1925, although the body and interior remained intact. The main upgrades included new connectors to allow them to run in multiple with newer trams and track brakes. With these upgrades the trailers normally ran with SS trams. One trailer was requisitioned by the German occupation forces and moved to the Stettin Tramway. It was numbered 519 and remained in service until 1945. One trailer collided on 16 May 1944 and was subsequently retired. The remaining nineteen units remained in service until May 1966 and October 1967, respectively. Many of the older undercarriages were rebuilt to maintenance of way material. This included five ballast cars, six flatcars and various other specialized vehicles. As of 1996 many were still in use. One of the \\"Municipa HaWa\\" trams has been preserved by the Oslo Tramway Museum. Except for the length, it has been remodeled in accordance with the delivery design from 1899. They museum attempted to preserve a trailer, but Oslo Sporveier instead chose to scrap the last unit in December 1969. However, the museum has preserved a ballast car. Specifications Egertorvet in 1902 The trams and the trailers had identical bodies. They were long and had a capacity for twenty passengers along two benches aligned along the width of the carriage. In their original configuration they featured outdoor bays, but this was removed in 1915. The cabin had two benches in the longitudinal direction, providing seating for 20 people. In addition there was standing space for 14 people in the motorized units and 20 in the trailers. Each motor car was equipped with two Schuckert AB71 two-pole serial motors, which each produced . This gave a total power output of . Controlling was carried out with two serial and three parallel contacts, as well as five for breaking. The resistance breaks worked poorly and thus manual breaking was used during ordinary operations. They were only equipped with primary suspension, which made the ride more uncomfortable. The modified units from 1919 received a lengthening, with longer and larger platform bays. This allowed standing capacity to rise to 48, although the cabin and the seating remained unaltered. The wheelbase increased to and track brakes and secondary suspension was installed. In the 1922 modification they were further extended by , this time the cabin was lengthened and seating increased to 24 and the platform bays were rebuilt with walls. In their final, \\"Municipal HaWa\\" configuration, the trams were long, weighed and had a power output of .

The Greek Revival building was constructed in 1846 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It is located in the Old Neighborhoods Historic District.  Description  The museum has been housed in the 1846 Cumberland Presbyterian Church of Lexington since its opening in 1976. The museum has a collection of early Lexington pictures. It also has on display an Overland Mail Company Bible as one of its many items related to the Pony Express mail service. It also contains historical memorabilia related to steamboats, coal mining, Osage Indians, and the Wentworth Military Academy. A sword that James A. Mulligan turned over in surrender, but was later allowed to keep per orders of General Sterling Price, is on display. The historical records on the sword show it was stolen by a young boy shortly after Mulligan's surrender and hidden in his father's farm near Lexington. It was returned to a lawyer around 1900. The lawyer returned it in 1912 to the widow of Colonel Mulligan. Her daughter returned it to the city of Lexington in 1917, where it stayed in a bank vault for 50 years. The family later donated the elaborately decorated sword to the Lexington Historical Museum in 1967. The sword was originally presented to Mulligan by the city of Chicago. The museum is located in downtown Lexington, where there are over one hundred pre-Civil War buildings. The city has more pre-Civil War homes and buildings than any other community in Missouri. The battlefield where the Battle of Lexington of the American Civil War took place is at this location. Lexington Historical Museum owns and operates the Heritage Park in Lexington, Missouri. The park commemorates the 1852 Saluda steamboat disaster. in which seventy-five Mormon immigrants were killed. A memorial bell tower is at Heritage Park.  History  The 1846 Cumberland Presbyterian Church was restored by funds raised by the local garden club in the 1970s. The garden club hosted tours of older homes of Lexington to gain profits that were contributed to the community. One such project was the restoration of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. After completion of the restoration in 1976 the doors officially opened as the Lexington Historical Museum. The building that contains the museum was at one time the Old Library Building of Lexington besides being the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.  Location  The museum is located at 112 South 13th Street in Lexington, Missouri. The museum is open to the public during the week in the summer, with visiting additionally on Saturdays and Sundays in May and October.

Dorman & Co was a company formed by William Henry Dorman in 1870 making cutting tools for the footwear industry. It diversified into other tools including grinders, and in 1903 into internal combustion engines. This was to be its main product up to the point where it was taken over by the English Electric Company in 1961, though the Dorman name continued as a diesel engine trademark until 1995 (from 1968 under the ownership of the General Electric Company plc, and later by Broadcrown Ltd). William Henry Dorman retired in 1911, and died in 1926. Origins 1919 Dormans Engines Advertisement The early origins of W.H. Dorman & Co were documented in a centenary booklet, marking the history of Dorman from 1870 to 1970. These were handed out to all employees and visitors to Dorman Diesels. Extracts from the centenary booklet have been reproduced on the Dorman Association website.\\"The First Hundred Years\\", The Dorman Association When the company was first formed it was to make sole and heel cutting knives for the local footwear industry. Within a few years this diversified into a wide range of machinery for industry, as well as the first refrigeration plant for the Smithfield meat market in London. Around 1897 the part of the business devoted to the footwear industry was sold off to the British United Shoe Machinery Co, and the business directed its efforts more towards printing, grinding, and knitwear machines. However, by 1903 they made their first internal combustion petrol engines and petrol-paraffin engines, and gradually engine manufacture was to become their main business. However, William Henry Dorman was a prolific inventor and between 1894 and 1914 there are 72 patents to his name, many related to the mechanisation of the manufacture of footwear, but also on diverse topics such as the trouser press, four-wheel-drive motor cars, and a method for separating cream from milk. Apart from the engines that were later to dominate the business, a great many other products were made, many of which were equipment for manufacturing industry. Factory records of the engine production exist from 1913,Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Archive Service: Staffordshire County Record Office, Ref No 1256/C/1 starting with engine number 701, however information on the engines produced from 1903 to 1912 is missing. The Dorman Association shows that from 1913 the JJ and JO engines were available in either 2-cylinder or 4-cylinder form, each with the same 110 mm bore and 140 mm stroke and with 8 bhp per cylinder. It is known that the 4-cylinder Dorman engine was fitted into the Pagefield trucks made by Walker Brothers of Wigan in 1913 to a War Department specification. In November 1913 Dorman were advertising that their 4-cylinder engine was awarded a \\"Special Certificate in the War Office Subsidy Trials\\".The Light Car and Cyclecar, 24 November 1913 This same advert lists a 2-cylinder water-cooled motor with 80 mm bore and 108 mm stroke, and other adverts from March and April 1914 show other engines were available.W.H. Dorman advertising for Olympia Aero, Motor Boat, Marine & Stationary Engine Exhibition, 1914 A Dorman engine powered the Caledon lorries from 1915-1919.Grace's Guide: Caledon Motors The Dorman Engineering Co of Northampton is sometimes confused with W.H. Dorman & Co. The principle partner there was Thomas Phipps Dorman (son of Mark Dorman), and the main product was the Dorman sewing machine, though they started manufacturing engines and made the Whirlwind motorised bicycle for a few years before failing in 1903.\\"Dorman History\\", Graham Forsdyke, ISMACS News, No 34 This failure coincides with the start of engine manufacture at W.H. Dorman, but no commercial or familial link has as yet been identified between the two companies. First World War The Dorman 2-cylinder (2JO) and 4-cylinder (4JO) engines were the only engines selected for the internal combustion 'rail tractors' used on the War Department Light Railways, these being made by Motor Rail (20 hp and 40 hp variants) with 2-speed gearboxes, and the 40 hp 4JO was used in the petrol-electric locomotives made by Dick, Kerr & Co. and British Westinghouse. After the war many of these rail tractors were overhauled and sold in the UK (some rebuilt onto standard gauge), and as a result many survive and a few of them still have the original Dorman engine. Dorman also made engines for marine use, and the 1917 'Red Book'The Motor, Marine and Aircraft Red Book, W.C.Bersey and A. Dorey, the Technical Publishing Company, 1917 lists a range of marine petrol engines that could be run on paraffin by specifying the addition of a \\"Haddon Patent Paraffin Vaporiser\\" at extra cost. The listed engines were: * A 2-cylinder engine of 6 hp at 800rpm with 80mm bore and 108mm stroke. Weight 198 lb * 3 of 4-cylinder engines, of 30 to 35 hp at 800rpm, stroke being 5.5inch, bore being 4.33in(30 hp), 4.5in(32 hp), 4.75in(35 hp). Weight 992 lb * 3 of 6-cylinder engines, of 45 to 55 hp at 800rpm, stroke being 5.5inch, bore being 4.33in(45 hp), 4.5in(50 hp), 4.75in(55 hp). Weight 12.5cwt Inter War Years Dorman continued as engine supplier to Motor Rail for peacetime variants of the rail tractors, which became known as Simplex locomotives.\\"A Guide to Simplex Narrow Gauge Locomotives\\", D.Hall, J.A.S.Rowland, Publ. Moseley Railway Trust (1 October 2001) Initially these used the same 2JO and 4JO petrol engines, though later they adopted Dorman-Ricardo diesel engines. 1919 saw an expansion in the range of engines, and diversification in the applications, including the Ruston & Hornsby car (models A1 and B1), which was produced until the mid-1920s. The Vulcan car of the 1920s also was available with a Dorman engine, and several other cars of very limited production used Dorman engines in the 1920s. The Dorman 4JO engines was also used in the new model 1922 40 hp Clayton & Shuttleworth 'chain-rail' crawler tractors. Their previous model, which had been made throughout the war, had a 35 hp rating, though it is not clear if these were also Dorman-engined. These crawler tractors were used for towing Handley-Page bombers, and later used by the RNLI. In 1930 Dorman introduced their first diesel engine, the RB,\\"A New Diesel\\", Commercial Motor, 24 September 1930 and from then on all new engines up to World War 2 were diesels. At the time of its introduction Dorman listed 19 different petrol engines from 8.5 to 100 bhp. This new twin-cylinder 4-stroke diesel used an Acro air-cell combustion head. The bore and stroke were 110mm and 180mm, giving a capacity of 3420cc, and it used Bosch 'solid' fuel injection. From 1932 the diesel engines were changed to use Ricardo style heads, and referred to as Dorman-Ricardo engines. Large numbers of these engines were used in early diesel trucks, either fitted to new chassis, or for the conversion of existing petrol engines trucks.The Modern Diesel, 8th edition, 1943 Production of Dorman-Ricardo marine and transport engines, mainly 4- or 6-cylinder units was to continue up to the war, at about which time Dorman introduced direct injection engines. Dorman started work on a V8 engine (model VRM) in 1938. Thornycroft were one of the truck manufacturers using Dorman engines in the 1930s, with the 4DS fitted into the Bullfinch 4-ton 4-wheeler, and the larger 4JUR specified for the Steadfast 4-ton truck. Second World War Dorman continued production through the war, with most engines moving to direct injection, and in 1942 were listed as producing 8 different marine diesel engines with 2,3,4 or 6 cylinders (production of the V8 may have been suspended), and a range of 5 road transport engines of 4 or 6 cylinders.The Modern Diesel, 7th Edition, Iliffe & Sons, 1942 Post-War By 1949 Dorman was no longer making engines for road transport, and their range focussed on marine and industrial engines.The Modern Diesel, 11th Edition, Publ Iliffe & Sons, 1949 The marine engines were by this time all direct injection, with the exception of the V8 VRM engine which had been further developed during the war, but still used Ricardo heads and was rated at 100 hp at 2300 rpm. While almost all engine production was diesel engines, Dorman did make a petrol engine ‚Äì the 1AB 800 cc 4-stroke single that was used in the Aveling-Barford calfdozer (a small bulldozer). There was also a twin-cylinder version, the 2AB. Production was from the mid-1940s into the 1950s. After the war, businesses favoured who exported, and Dorman was very successful. By 1952, 85% of its production was either directly or indirectly exported. In 1953 the new 'L' series engines were launched with the LA. These were a new design of engine dating back to 1946, with maximum interchangeability of parts. The largest single order for these engines was from Canada for hundreds of engines to drive radar stations situated along the 69th parallel. In 1957 the 'Q' series engines were launched, with an in-line 6-cylinder and V8 and V12 engines. Surviving engines are often found in emergency generator rooms, and this appears to have been one of the main markets for these engines, though they were also to be found in fishing boats. In 1959, Dorman merged with the neighbouring factory of W.G. Bagnall, and, with full order books, in 1961 W.H. Dorman became the Dorman Engines Division of English Electric Ltd. Dorman diesels continued to be produced, and in 1964 Dorman added the 'DA' range of engines alongside the existing 'Q' and 'L' series engines. The 'DA' had applications for snow-blowers, grain-dryers and compressors. Under English Electric Ltd some of the smaller Ruston diesel designs came under the Dorman Engine Division, and in 1969 36 different diesel engines were listed from 5.5 bhp to 910 bhp (4 of which were small Rustons).British Engines, The BICEMA Catalogue, 7th edition, Sparta Pres, 1969 These were subdivided into the following application areas: * Industrial - with prime applications being pumping sets and earthmoving equipment * Marine Auxiliary - for winches, bow thrusters, compressors, heating lighting, navigation aids, and pumps * Marine Propulsion - for tugs, dredgers, lifeboats, fishing boats, pilot vessels and a wide range of other craft * Generating Sets - both for continuous use, but especially for emergency generators for hospitals, telecomms and other uses from 3 to 572 kW * Dorman Traction - use in industrial railway shunters Dorman became the wholly owned Dorman Diesels Ltd in c. 1970, however markets tended to decline into the decade. By the 1980s Dorman was struggling, and in 1987 its then owner GEC sold the business to Broadcrown Ltd (which was a generator company formed by two ex-Dorman employees many years before David and Frank Borgman). There were various attempts at diversification, with some marine units being sold, but the main output was still generators. In 1994 the business was sold to Perkins Engines, and 1995 finally saw the last range renamed as Perkins engines, and the Dorman name was dropped. In 2010 the rights to the older (non SE series) engines was acquired from Perkins Engines Company Ltd by Lincoln Diesels Ltd along with Perkins' entire stockholding of non SE series spare parts. Lincoln Diesels Ltd has revived the Dorman Diesels name and now supplies new parts for the older engines and complete engines on an exchange basis from their works in Lincoln.

Built about 1839, it is one of a small number of Greek Revival buildings to survive, out of many that once graced the town. It has seen use as a single-family residence, tavern, and boarding house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and included in the Center Sandwich Historic District, in 1983. Description and history Hansen's Annex stands in the village of Center Sandwich, on the south side of Main Street (New Hampshire Route 113) just west of its junction with New Hampshire Route 109. It is a two-story wood frame house, three bays wide and a single room deep, with a side-gable roof. The front facade has a centered entry, with flanking sidelight windows and a slightly peaked entablature. A single-story ell extends behind the building, joining it to a 20th-century garage. The interior of the house is sparely finished, with beaded vertical planking on the walls. The village of Center Sandwich experienced a significant flowering of architecture between 1830 and 1860, with a significant number of temple- fronted Greek Revival buildings constructed, including commercial and residential buildings. This assemblage was one of the finest such collections in New Hampshire's Lakes Region, but was largely lost in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to fire and demolition. This house is one of the few remaining buildings with Greek Revival features. The house was built sometime before 1839, when its sale from Ezra Gould to John Folsom was recorded, and apparently served as a private residence at that time. By 1868 it was owned by George Hansen, who used the house and an attached barn (no longer extant) as a tavern and livery stable. Hansen's son Frank bought a house across the street, which he converted for use as a tenement, making this smaller house a functional annex to that property. In 1965 it was converted back to single- family use.

It is located on the south side of the Santa Fe River, to which it is connected. The water is clear and cold and there are accessible caverns with a sand and limestone bottom. Ginnie Springs has been privately owned by the Wray family since 1971 and began functioning in 1976. In the mid-1990s when scuba diving grew in popularity, Bob Wray opened the springs to the public. Due to the increasing number of scuba diver deaths, Wray took precautions by putting in an iron grate over the most dangerous part of the cave and placing warning signs for divers. The popularity of Ginnie took off and it became a nationally renowned diving spot which is still largely popular today. Today in addition to diving, customers can swim, snorkel, canoe, kayak, stand up paddleboard, and tube along the Sante Fe River. Along the river, there are various springs travelers can enter and swim in. This is a source for bottled spring water. Due to the crystal-clear water of the spring, it is easy to view wildlife as well as wreaths underneath. Nestle was granted permission to take over 1.1 million gallons daily from the aquifer that feeds Ginnie and other nearby springs. This has sparked a global outcry. Ginnie Springs is one of the most popular places in Florida to go river tubing. Tubing the Sante Fe River as part of the Ginnie Springs tube run takes about 1 hour to complete from start to finish. Near the springs the water is 72 degrees Fahrenheit but warmer in the river. Since it is a privately owned spring, there are few restrictions on tubers in the Sante Fe River. Tubers are permitted to use tubes of any size and are also allowed to consume alcohol while tubing. Ginnie Springs is one of the few springs in Florida which allows the consumption of alcohol on the tube run. Ginnie is also well known for camping. Visitors can make reservations for water and electric campsites. There are 129 water and electric campsites in total, which are located across from the park's store. A reservation is not needed for primitive campsites, but they are first-come, first-served.

It was founded in the very early days of Aberaman as an industrial settlement, on land donated by Crawshay Bailey. Bailey was the owner of the Aberaman Estate since 1837, and his industrial activities were the catalyst for the industrial development of the locality. Early history The original chapel was built in Regent Street in 1848, although a Sunday School had been held nearby. The cost of the original building was ¬£500 and the building accommodated a congregation of 550. There were 69 members in 1848 and some members are said to have joined Libanus having left Gwawr Baptist Chapel nearby. A gallery was installed in 1850. By 1853 Libanus had 85 members. A new chapel was built in Lewis Street in 1876. E.M. Evans from Trefeca College was inaugurated as minister of Libanus on 30 January 1893. The Twentieth Century J. Harris Jones was inaugurated as minister of Libanus on 25 May 1903, having previously been the minister of Llest church in the Garw Valley. The services were presided over by William James, minister of Bethania, Aberdare. Harris Jones remained at Libanus until 1907. In 1907 a split occurred in the church. The reason was that the Calvinistic Methodist district meeting had agreed a pay rise for all ministers in the locality. (in contrast to the Baptists and Independents these decisions were taken centrally, a feature that can be traced back to the secession from the established church). The deacons at Libanus, several of whom were described as holding socialistic tendencies, objected, as they believed the minister's salary was sufficient. It was soon rumoured that some of the deacons were seeking to be rid of the minister in order to replace him with ILP activist, George Bibbings, who was a candidate for the ministry. A long-running disputes transpired, with the church split into two factions who clashed openly and even at times lapsed into physical violence. The majority of the members, in contrast to the deacons, were said to support the minister, while women among the congregation being accused of behaving like suffragettes. A committee was eventually appointed by the district meeting, chaired by the Rev J. Lewis of Hebron, Godreaman to seek a resolution. In time the committee resolved to ask the minister to resign his pastorate. Four members of the congregation subsequently wrote to the district meeting seeking to overturn this resolution but it was unanimously endorsed by the district meeting. In September, however, it was reported in the denominational journal, Y Goleuad, that the minister had been advised to resign his pastorate and that he had consented to do so. Electric lighting was installed at Libanus in 1922. A centenary history, by D.J. Jones, was published in 1948. Later history The chapel was closed in 1985 and converted into flats circa 2004.

Full birth name is: Valerius Victor Emiel Marie de SaedeleerValerius de Saedeleer at Aalst city website (4 August 1867 - 16 September 1941) was a Belgian landscape painter, whose works are informed by a symbolist and mystic-religious sensitivity and the traditions of 16th-century Flemish landscape painting. He was one of the main figures in the so-called first School of Latem which in the first decade of the 20th century introduced modernist trends in Belgian painting and sculpture.Willem Elias, 'De ‚Äòschool‚Äô van Latem', 21 November 2008 Life =Beginnings= The end of a gloomy day Valerius de Saedeleer was born in Aalst, Belgium as the son of a small businessman who operated a soda and soap making factory. As a result of conflicts with his parents and problems at school, he left school at age fifteen and was forced by his father to study an acceptable profession. To this end, he was employed as an apprentice at a Ghent weaving workshop and took classes in weaving at an industrial school in Ghent. Without his parents' knowledge he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent, where he met Theo van Rysselberghe and George Minne. =Wandering existence= Unhappy with the academic teaching at the Ghent Academy, he moved to Brussels where he studied for four years with the impressionist landscape painter Franz Courtens. He then started working as an independent artist. In his early work, the artist remained indebted to his teacher Courtens and was influenced by Emile Claus. This showed he still searching for his own style. On 14 November 1889 the young artist married in Aalst Clementina 'Clemmeke' Limpens (1867-1930), a grocer's daughter from Erembodegem, near Aalst. They had five daughters, of which the second, Elisabeth de Saedeleer (1902-1972), became an artist in her own right. The father of de Saedeleer's wife gave her a large sum of money as dowry. The young couple used the funds to establish a grocery in Blankenberge. The bankruptcy that followed quickly led to the couple's wandering and destitute existence. They lived for short periods in Blankenberge, Wenduine, Damme and Ghent. In 1892 the couple lived in Afsnee, near Ghent, where de Saedeleer met Albijn Van den Abeele. Albijn Van den Abeele was the town clerk of Sint-Marten-Latem (often referred to by its shorter form 'Latem') and an amateur painter. He arranged for cheap lodging for artists in Sint-Marten-Latem and thereby supported the launch of one of the most important artistic movements in early 20th century Belgium. From April to October 1893 de Saedeleer lived in Sint-Martens-Latem. Here he reconnected with his friend George Minne and met the young student and aspiring poet Karel van de Woestijne. Between 1895 and 1898 de Saedeleer and his wife lived in Lissewege where they raised chickens. =Maturity= Winter in Flanders In 1898 de Saedeleer moved back to Sint-Martens-Latem. There he formed part of the first artist colony of the village, together with Gustave van de Woestijne (the brother of Karel van de Woestijne) and George Minne. This group of artists were later referred to as the first School of Latem. The first School of Latem comprised mainly artists who had moved to the countryside in search of a close contact with the soil, to discover a primitive world untainted by modern civilization. There they hoped to find values such as integrity, spontaneity and simplicity. In their quest for that purity they re-examined the art of the old masters. They were influenced by the symbolism that sought to imbue reality with values. They were also inspired by a Christian worldview bordering on the mystical. The painters moved away from the then popular luminism of Emile Claus and his followers and turned towards a more sombre, sober palet, with influences of late Medieval Flemish painting. Around 1905 other artists would move to Sint-Martens-Latem. These artists, the most notable of whom included Constant Permeke, Albert Servaes and Gustave de Smet, are referred to as the second School of Latem. They started out as impressionists but would develop towards an expressionist idiom in reaction to their experiences in World War I. A panoramic view of Tiegem Despite the success of a first exhibition in 1901 in Aalst, de Saedeleer struggled to live solely from his art and was forced to raise poultry for a living. The next year he visited the Exposition des primitifs flamands √† Bruges, which left a lasting impression and influence on his work. In 1903, he exhibited his landscapes at the Salon in Paris, where he was influenced by the works of √âmile-Ren√© M√©nard. The same year he converted to Christianity. From 1904-1905 onwards, de Saedeleer found his own style. His work started to show a synthetic, purified vision. His landscapes no longer referenced time or space. He represented the still nature in a composed landscape which was almost always limited by a low horizon. The surface of his canvases was smoothed and he used a soft harmony of colours. The landscapes of this time have a sublime, almost unreal sense of space. In these works the artist was clearly engaged in a symbolistic search for the soul of the landscape, likely under the influence of his conversion to Christianity. He often painted winter landscapes. De Saedeleer exhibited at the 1904 exhibitions of the Berlin, Munich and Vienna Secession and a few exhibitions in Belgium. He started getting attention in the media and collectors started buying his work. By 1907, he had become the most successful of the painters from Latem. He was particularly well received in the German speaking countries, where the influence of Eug√®ne Laermans on his work was noted. He exhibited at the Salon in Ghent in 1906. In 1907, he had an exhibition in Ghent together with Maurits Sys and Gustave van de Woestijne. =Later years= Orchard in winter In 1908 he moved to Tiegem. The move to this more hilly area of Flanders was reflected in his landscapes. The mostly flat views of the Leie landscapes changed to more hilly landscapes. He remained successful, and in 1909 the Museums of Fine Arts of Ghent and Aalst acquired some of his works. In 1911 the Belgian royal family bought his Smidse in de Winter (Smithy in Winter), a snow landscape. He later exhibited at the \\"Pour l'Art\\" exhibitions in 1912 and 1914, and was one of the co-founders of \\"La Jeune Peinture Belge\\" in 1924. In 1913 his old friend from Latem, Gustave van de Woestijne, joined him in Tiegem. From 1914 de Saedeleer and his family lived in Wales as refugees from the First World War. Together with his family and the family of his friend George Minne he lived a number of years in Cwmystwyth. Gustave van de Woestijne and George Minne and their families also resided in Wales during the war. The family de Saedeleer and other Belgian artists were brought to Wales by David, Gwendoline and Margaret Davies. The two Davies sisters were best known for putting together one of the great British art collections of the 20th Century.Ty'n y Lon, nr Aberystwyth: Home of Belgian Artist Valerius de Saedeleer at the BBC website The initiative of the Davies family in inviting Belgian artists to Wales was prompted by their expectation that these artists would be able to inject local cultural life with their expertise.Caterina Verdickt, The case of Elisabeth De Saedeleer (1902‚Äì1972). The influence of Welsh hospitality in the Great War on Belgian Modernist interior design, in: The BRITISH ART Journal Volume XV, No. 3, p. 93-98 De Saedeleer's daughters studied weaving, binding and tapestry at Aberystwyth. The second daughter Elisabeth became acquainted with William Morris' daughter Mary from whom she learned tapestry weaving. The family became so accomplished at weaving that they even started giving courses in the craft themselves. De Saedeleer may have undertaken some conservation work on items from the Aberystwyth University Collection. He also exhibited his paintings of local views in the University's Alexandra Hall and was able to earn a living from his art. De Saedeleer remained in Wales until 1920, when he moved to Etikhove. In 1933 he became an honorary citizen of the city of Aalst. In 1937 he moved to Leupegem. The work of de Saedeleer became gradually more decorative and he developed a luxuriant and whimsical calligraphy. His compositions often included a row of trees in the foreground, a Japanese-style effect with which he had already experimented before the war. This device is clear in the composition Winter in Flanders. He was also an accomplished colourist.  Honours  * 1924 : Officer in the Order of the Crown.RD 21.7.1924 Influence The work of de Saedeleer was influential on Belgian landscape painters of the next generation such as Albert Claeys and Albert Saverys whose work referenced de Saedeleer and his inspiration, Pieter Brueghel the Elder. In recent years the work of the artist has been the subject of retrospective exhibitions such as those held in Aalst in 1967, in Oudenaarde in 1998, again in Aalst in 2000, and in Deinze in 2006.

It was built by hand in the 19th century to irrigate the surrounding rice field in Las Pi√±as and Bacoor. History Molino Dam historical marker =The Birth of Hacienda de San Nicholas= The San Juan de Imus Hacienda was purchased by Don Tomas de Andaya in 1685. The piece of land contiguous to Imus was then sold by Father Jose de Solis, a secular priest, to the Recollects in 1690. The third piece of land was handed down by Do√±a Hipolita de Zarate y Ozeguera in November 1666 to them, giving rise to Hacienda de San Nicholas. Father Fidel de Blas, author of oft-quoted Labor evangelica de los Padres Agustinos Recoletos en las Islas Filipinas [Evangelical Labor of the Augustinian Recollect Fathers in the Philippine Islands] confesses the dismal plight of the haciendas: The haciendas of that period yielded very little, for they were still lands to be tilled and developed. And hardly was there any able work force tapped for their cultivation. Since their produce was not of much import yet, all we could draw from the haciendas was utilized to ameliorate the same, constructing huge water channels, dams in ravines as water depository, and irrigation canals. =Construction of irrigation dams= From 1780 to 1893, the hacienda administrators built forty-five irrigation dams with tunnels, waterways, and irrigation canals in order to channel available water sources to excellent use, that way securing rice fields during extended drought periods. Father Ezekiel Moreno commenced the repair of Molino Dam in Bacoor, one of the hacienda's most useful dams. His predecessors appropriated considerable sums of money for breaking up untilled lands, putting up mangrove embankments, draining swamps, and building vital road arteries and streets. Also, a total of thirteen stone and brick bridges were constructed at the expense of Saint Nicholas province. =Saint Ezekiel Moreno= Bust of Saint Ezekiel Moreno Saint Ezekiel Moreno y Diaz (1848 - 1906) is an Augustinian Recollect whose mission is to serve and solidify his pastoral zeal for the benefit of the people in need. Ordained as priest on June 2, 1871 in Manila, he was given parochial assignments to several towns and provinces in the Philippines including Cavite between September 1882 and April 1885 and Las Pi√±as between June 1876 and June 1879. He became superior of San Juan Bautista de Imus Priory and administrator of the Recollect haciendas of Bacoor, Imus, and Dasmari√±as, Cavite. When the cholera plague ravaged the barrios of Mambog and Salinas in Bacoor, Cavite and several Cavite√±os were affected in the epidemic, Saint Ezekiel gave the sacrament of the anointing of the sick to 3,197 victims of the cholera. =Repair works of Molino Dam= One of the pressing problems that have occupied the administrator's attention was the Molino Dam. Father Moreno redacted a letter urging the \\"need and great convenience of repairing the Molino Dam\\" especially due to protracted drought periods. The 1885 drought moved the parish curate to request for the rehabilitation of the dam wall answer the need for food of many residents. It would be extremely beneficial for San Nicolas, he reason out, if the walls of the dam were raised higher. The proposed repair aimed to provide more water capacity to the Molino Dam. On April 24, 1885, Provincial Definitorium approved the budget proposal of 3,926.00 pesos and the dam was reconstructed. Description Series of buttresses made out of adobe stones The Molino Dam is a man-made irrigation dam - its walls made out of adobe (height ranging from 25-30 stacks) and some parts of the flooring made out of cobble stones. Series of buttresses support its perimeter walls. Also, the growth of vegetation flourished because of the natural composition of the building materials. Balete trees and bamboo grasses were within the site. They contributed to the enhanced structural integrity of the dam. Former medium of freshwater flow in Zapote The Molino Dam raised the level of water in the upper Zapote River three stories high - the same level as the fields. It also separated the freshwater coming from Almanza and the Molino River from the saltwater of the lower Zapote River. It enabled the irrigation and the rice farming of vast tracts of dry land in Las Pi√±as and Bacoor. Molino Dam and its attached water distribution system was an outstanding feat of hydrological engineering. Former medium of saltwater flow in Zapote Present situation =Sagip Ilog= From 2002 to 2005, 9,070 residents from various communities along the river system in Las Pinas City, Paranaque City and Bacoor, Cavite were trained on ecological solid waste and river management. Some of them were designated river watch volunteers, grouped into 98 teams with 3,576 members. This undertaking has been the commitment of the Couples for Christ-Oikos Ministry volunteers who, since June 2003, have devoted every Saturday conducting values formation and solid waste management education for the Las Pi√±as residents. They were trained on ecological solid waste management as an important component of the program. Some of them became river watch volunteers. =Las Pi√±as River Station and Livelihood Center= Las Pi√±as River Station and Livelihood Center In commemoration of the Molino Dam as a historic testament to the engineering prowess of 18th and 19th century residents of Las Pi√±as, the Las Pi√±as River Station and Livelihood Center was inaugurated in July 28, 2006. It is located at BF Resort Village Barangay Talon Dos. It is a project of former Senator Manny Villar and Congresswoman Cynthia Villar; aiming to serve as a recreation area and tourist attraction. =Rehabilitation and Restoration of Prinza= Proclaimed under SB Resolution No. 50 The Molino Dam now serve as a footbridge for easy access from Las Pi√±as City to Bacoor, Cavite and vice versa. In commemoration of Saint Ezekiel Moreno's dedication and contribution to the people of Cavite and Las Pi√±as City, Las Pi√±as City and the Municipality of Bacoor, Cavite embarked on a joint project entitled \\"Rehabilitation and Restoration of Prinza\\", a beautification and preservation effort to develop a section of the historic dam. This mark Saint Ezekiel Moreno y Diaz's legacy and the friendship of Las Pi√±as and Bacoor, Cavite in their efforts to preserve a significant historical site.

Works Taverner is known for the plays he wrote, particularly The Artful Husband, produced at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 11 February 1717: it ran for 15 nights. It was acted again in May 1721, and was later adapted by George Colman the elder as The Female Chevalier (1778) and William Macready the elder as The Bank Note (1795). Taverner himself borrowed from The Lady of Pleasure by James Shirley, and from The Counterfeit Bridegroom (1677), an adaptation of Thomas Middleton's No Wit, No Help, like a Woman's sometimes attributed to Thomas Betterton. It was reported, too, that he was assisted by Joseph Browne. The play as printed ran through three editions; in the preface Taverner complained of the injustice of John Rich, the patentee of the theatre, towards authors. A companion comedy, The Artful Wife, appeared at Lincoln's Inn Fields 3 December 1717. It was printed with the date 1718 on the title-page. Other works were: * A masque on the story of Ixion (1697), performed around that time with The Italian Husband by Edward Ravenscroft. * The Faithful Bride of Granada, acted at Drury Lane in 1704, and published in the same year. * The Maid the Mistress, brought out at Drury Lane on 5 June 1708. * The Female Advocates, acted only once, at Drury Lane, on 6 January 1713 (it was in part copied from The Lunatic, an anonymous unperformed piece of 1705). * Presumptuous Love, printed without date, in 1716.

Biography Capocci received training in organ and harmony from his father Gaetano (1811-1898) and in 1861 he received a piano diploma from the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome. In 1875, he was appointed organist of the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. In 1898, he succeeded his father as choirmaster at the Basilica. He also served in the Roman churches of St. Ignatius and St. Mary of Montserrat. Unlike his father, Filippo Capocci adhered to nineteenth-century musical aesthetics, avoiding the theatrical style, and dedicated himself to a style of performance and composition similar to that of the French organist Alexandre Guilmant. His opportunity for wider recognition came in 1881 with the inaugural concert for the new Merklin organ at the Church of St. Louis of France. By this time, thanks to his friendship with Guilmant, the world's largest churches opened their doors to Capocci. Capocci was also one of the three foreign organists who performed in a series of organ concerts using the Cavaille-Coll organ at Trocadero during the 1889 Paris World Fair. In 1890, his performance with Guilmant and Polleri for the inauguration of the new organ of William George Trice at the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Genoa marked another point in favor of the Cecilian Movement that resulted from his work as a performer and tester of new organs. Capocci also endorsed the proposal of the chapter of canons of St. John for the construction of two new organs that were installed at the conclusion of the renovation of the apse built by Pope Leo XIII. This work was commissioned by Nicholas Morettini, one of the first builders in Italy to endorse the principles of the reform. Franz Liszt, while staying in Rome, sought to meet Capocci personally and expressed great esteem and friendship. In 1899, he was received among the members of the American Guild of Organists. He was appointed a member of the organ faculty for the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music in 1911 but was never able to teach because of an illness that debilitated him for months until his death in July 1911. He was the mentor of several noted personalities, which included Queen Margherita of Italy and the Brazilian composer and organist Furio Francheschini. Works His output for organ consists of about 200 works and includes seven sonatas for organ, twelve volumes of Original Pieces for organ, six volumes for the Divine Office, several volumes of various other compositions, and a Fantasia composed expressly for the inauguration of the organ at St. John Lateran. As choirmaster, Capocci also devoted himself to vocal composition composing at least three Masses. His works give an almost neoclassical impression and reflect an orchestral and symphonic taste. Today his compositions, which are not well known, are starting to be performed by organists in concert, a sign of renewed interest in a teacher who, in all respects, ought to be considered one of the fathers of a new Italian organ school. Honors In 1892 Pope Leo XIII awarded him the Knighthood of St. Gregory the Great. References BOEZI, E., (1912), In Memoriam, School Tip. Fano, Fano.

D.\\" Gass (February 29, 1828 - December 10, 1924) was an American prospector, businessman, and politician. A four term member of the Arizona Territorial Legislature, he was active in the early history of Las Vegas, Nevada and the creation of Pah-Ute County, Arizona Territory. Early life Gass was born to John and Ann (McCleur) Gass near Mansfield in Richland County, Ohio on February 29, 1828. He was educated in public schools. Tradition holds he attended Oberlin College but there are no school records confirming this claim. His education did however provide him with a basic knowledge of Spanish and civil engineering. At the start of the California Gold Rush, Gass took a ship from Baltimore, Maryland to California by way of Cape Horn, arriving in January 1850. Upon his arrival in San Francisco, Gass earned money unloading prefabricated shelters from a ship. The wages he earned from this job served as a grubstake as be went to El Dorado County to prospect. There he engaged in placer mining and developed a lifelong friendship with Fenton M. Slaughter. After a few years, and moderate success in their prospecting efforts, Gass and Slaughter moved to the small town of Los Angeles. Gass joined the local Masonic lodge on December 30, 1854 and gained full privileges on November 22, 1855. His ability to speak Spanish and deal with different cultures resulted in Gass being appointed zanjero (water overseer) for a time. In addition to his official duties, Gass continued his prospecting efforts. One such endeavour involved a tin deposit in the Temescal Mountains. At the time, the United States imported all its tin, making a tin mine a very lucrative possibility. Gass joined with Slaughter, David Sexton, and several other investors in an attempt to purchase the Rancho Temescal (Serrano), on which the mineral deposit resided, but found that Abel Stearns had already bought the ranch. A scramble for land and mineral rights soon developed as word of the find spread. Gass ended up with several valid claims but the 1860 United States Presidential Election and approach of the American Civil War dried up investor interest. Hopes for riches from the tin deposit soon faded as legal challenges tied up his interests for the next two decades. Las Vegas Rancho From Southern California, Gass moved to the El Dorado Canyon, south of modern-day Boulder City, Nevada. He continued his prospecting activities, filing eighteen claims between March 16, 1862 and December 17, 1864. Poor results prompted him to move to the area near modern-day Las Vegas. During his explorations, Gass discovered an outcropping of salt and spent early 1865 working the find. In late 1865, Gass moved into the old Mormon fort at Las Vegas with Nathaniel Lewis and Lewis Cole. Originally built in 1855, the fort had been abandoned in 1857. Rights to the property were purchased from William Knapp. Knapp in turn had inherited the rights from his brother, Albert, who had been one of the original Mormon missionaries that built the fort. Gass initially owned but by 1872 had bought out his partners and owned the entire ranch. The name of the ranch was changed to Las Vegas Rancho to differentiate it from Las Vegas, New Mexico The abandoned fort was in a state of general disrepair went Gass moved in. He and his partners set about the process of repairing the property and turning it into a way station for travelers using the Old Spanish Trail. Gass and his partners began raising cattle and horses. The fields were planted initially with barley, oats, and wheat with a variety of vegetables and melons added by the second harvest. Orchards were added to produce apples, apricots, figs, and peaches. To all this Gass added of Mexican pink beans. The local Paiute, used to mesquite beans, considered the pink beans a luxury and Gass used them in lieu of wages when he hired them to work the fields. Wine from the ranch's vineyard became popular with visiting travelers. Gass became a financial backer for the nearby town of Callville, Arizona Territory He envisioned the town as a river port which Mormon migrants, traveling up the Colorado River from the Gulf of California, would use on their way to Utah. Gass promoted the town in newspapers and served as the town's postmaster. Gass's dreams for the town never came to fruition as completion of the transcontinental railroad provided an easier means to reach Utah. The town's post office was closed on June 15, 1869. His position as a businessman and landowner provided Gass with political influence within northwestern Arizona Territory. He leveraged this influence and was elected in 1865 to represent Mohave County in the House of Representatives (lower house) of the 2nd Arizona Territorial Legislature. Upon his arrival in Prescott, Gass discovered only nine other legislators had made the trip to the territorial capital and used the reduced numbers to his advantage. The result was passage of a bill that he drafted which created Pah- Ute County from northern Mohave County and established Callville as the county seat. Nevada On May 5, 1866, much of Pah-Ute county, including the area around Gass' Las Vegas Ranch was moved to Lincoln County, Nevada by the U.S. Congress. Gass initially refused to accept the change and declined to pay Nevada taxes. He and his neighbors petitioned the Nevada legislature to create Las Vegas county from the southern section of Lincoln County, but their request was ignored. Gass also joined with other Arizona politicians to twice complain to Congress about the boundary change. The boundary change became finalized in January 1867 when the Nevada Legislature unanimously accepted the new border. Despite living in Nevada, Gass continued to represent Pah-Ute county in the Arizona Territorial Legislature for another 3 years. During the 1886 session, he became a member of the council (upper house). He chaired a joint committee on military and Indian affairs and served as the session's Spanish language translator. Gass was elected President of the council during the 4th Arizona Territorial Legislature. During the 5th Arizona Territorial Legislature, Gass represented both Mohave and Pah-Ute counties. To reach the new territorial capital in Tucson, Gass and Andrew S. Gibbons rafted down the Colorado River. The two men chose this route to avoid Indian attack but instead hazarded several sets of rapids in their boat. Upon reaching Yuma they were delayed because a stagecoach had been attacked by Indians, killing all aboard, and a replacement driver was not immediately available. The pair arrived at the session a week late but were able to entertain other legislators with tales of their journey. Shortly after the boundary change was finalized, Lincoln County began demanding two years of back taxes from their new residents. About 600 Mormon residents along the Muddy River refused to make the payment and instead abandoned their homes to move to Utah. The combination of taxes and the loss of 600 regular customers was a significant financial blow to Gass. In addition to the taxes, Gass needed money to deal continuing legal battles over the Temescal Tin Mine Gass also saw a significant reduction in his political influence as the 600 composed much of his political base. He would later become Lincoln County Justice of the Peace but never regained his previous political sway. Gass married Mary Virginia Simpson, a niece of Ulysses S. Grant, on February 24, 1872 in Pioche, Nevada. He had met her when her caravan had stopped at his ranch in early 1871. Simpson was traveling with her sister and brother-in-law, Ann and Isaac Jennings, from Los Angeles to Arizona but had been stopped by high water on the Colorado River. Instead of continuing to Arizona, the Jennings bought some farmland near St. Thomas. For close to a year, Gass had made frequent trips to St. Thomas to court Simpson. Following their wedding, the couple had six children, including a set of twins. The Spring ranch was added to Gass's holdings on January 22, 1878. While at the time he appeared to the world as a successful rancher, which and 30 employees, Gass had a large level of debt. He was also beginning to worry about how he would provide an education and social opportunities to his children. As early as 1868, Gass began searching for someone interested in buying his ranch. In 1874 he mortgaged his property to William Knapp for $3,000. To pay off this debt he borrowed $5000 in gold from Archibald Stewart in August 1879. Gass had expected a good harvest that year but bad weather destroyed much of his crop. Gass received a 9-month extension but was still unable to pay his debt. As a result, Stewart foreclosed on May 2, 1881. Later life Gass and his family left Las Vegas in June 1881 with their personal possessions and 1,500 head of cattle. They drove the cattle to Pomona, California and sold them to Richard Gird, who was looking for cattle to stock the Rancho Santa Ana del Chino. He then moved to near White Water, California where he tried growing grapes. Winds and lack of water thwarted his efforts however. Beginning in 1884, Gass joined several groups of prospectors exploring various locations in eastern San Bernardino County, California and Baja California. Shortly after 1900, Gass joined his son Fenton in Bryn Mawr, California. There he helped with his son's orange orchard and tended a small garden. Gass died in Bryn Mawr on December 10, 1924 He was buried at Redlands, California's Hillside Cemetery in the Masonic Plot. Gass Peak, the southernmost peak in the Las Vegas Range, and Gass Avenue, a street in Downtown Las Vegas were named in his honor.

Members Mat McNerney and Valtteri Arino continued the band in 2015 as Grave Pleasures, following Johan Snell and Paile's departure with the group. With new members, Grave Pleasures released Dreamcrash months later.  History  = Formation as Beastmilk= Beastmilk was founded in 2010 by Mat McNerney, Johan Snell, Valtteri Arino and Paile in Helsinki, Finland. The band name came about because McNerney and Snell read White Stains by Aleister Crowley, and wanted to have a dialogue about what it means to be a man and go through all these male emotions. It was sort of a conversation on what is your father‚Äôs milk, what is your mother‚Äôs milk and so on. It also came out of Snell's interest in liquids and how it affects society. The band later self-released a demo, White Stains on Black Tape, in the same year. The demo was well received including from musicians Fenriz of Darkthrone and Nate Newton of Converge. On April 2, 2012, Beastmilk released an EP Use Your Deluge under Finnish label Svart Records. On June 2013, the band went to Salem, Massachusetts to record their debut full-length Climax, with Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou at his own recording studio GodCity Studio. Climax was released on November 29, 2013 under the Magic Bullet Records label. = Name change with new lineup = Following the positive reception of Climax, Sony was interested in offering Beastmilk to join the label under Columbia Records. At the time of the offer, there were tensions between Snell and the rest of Beastmilk. Former The Oath guitarist Linnea Olsson joined Beastmilk in August 2015, shortly after the departure of drummer Paile. Linnea Olsson toured with the band as their new second guitarist in October 2015 when they joined In Solitude. In 2015 the group moved on without Snell, leaving McNerney and Arino the original members of the band. McNerney and Arino took the name Grave Pleasures.

Soon afterwards the Western Vaudeville Managers Association (WVMA) was formed as a cartel of theater owners in Chicago and the west, dominated by the Orpheum Circuit. Although rivals, the two organizations collaborated in booking acts and dealing with the performers' union, the White Rats. By 1913 Edward Franklin Albee II had effective control over both the VMA and WVMA. In the 1920s vaudeville went into decline, unable to compete with film. In 1927 the Keith-Albee and Orpheum chains merged. The next year they became part of the RKO Pictures. Background Edward F Albee in 1894 The Theatrical Syndicate was formed in 1896 by Marcus Klaw, A. L. Erlanger Charles Frohman, Al Hayman, Samuel F. Nixon and Fred Zimmerman. Between them they controlled three quarters of the legitimate theaters. Touring companies who booked through the syndicate had to play only in syndicate theaters. Although the syndicate never achieved a monopoly, by 1903 it controlled most first class theater productions. In 1900 Pat Shea of Buffalo proposed to Benjamin Franklin Keith and Edward Franklin Albee II of Boston that they should set up a similar arrangement for vaudeville. They called a meeting in May 1900 in Boston of most of the major vaudeville managers, including Weber & Fields, Tony Pastor, Hyde & Behman of Brooklyn, Kohl & Castle, Colonel J.D. Hopkins, and Meyerfield & Beck of the Orpheum Circuit of the western USA. They did not invite Frederick Freeman Proctor, Keith's main competitor, but the other managers objected to this and insisted on a meeting in New York where Proctor was invited. The Vaudeville Managers Association (VMA) was founded at the New York meeting. Keith and Albee dominated the new organization. The purpose of the Vaudeville Managers Association was to end bidding wars for popular acts and eliminate competition between managers for the same audience. The VMA central booking office would arrange all bookings for touring performers in exchange for 5% of their pay. The ground rules for what would become the United Booking Office (UBO) were thrashed out in the VMA meetings. Essentially the VMA was a \\"monopsony\\", where a single employer dominates the labor market. Since the theater managers controlled the VMA, they determined the pay and conditions. Under the new system, acts were booked individually. This forced the break-up of vaudeville companies run by producers who arranged complete travelling shows. On the positive side, performers who paid their dues gained access to the best theaters, with schedules that minimized travel distances and gaps in engagements. History Martin Beck, head of the Orpheum Circuit The theater managers continued to act independently in setting pay and competing for turf, so the main goals of the VMA were not achieved. After about a year F.F. Proctor left and started booking his own acts. Percy G. Williams of Brooklyn refused to join, so the monopoly was not complete. The Western Managers Association (WMA) originated in 1903 when Meyerfield & Beck of the Orpheum arranged to provide bookings for the Sullivan & Considine theaters in the northwest. Various small-time circuits signed up to the WMA for bookings. The UBO was eventually incorporated in 1906, with the stated aim of eliminating inefficiencies and making sure there was enough proven talent to meet demand. It served the Keith-Albee circuit and many small-time theaters. The UBO had a powerful position. An agent would struggle to get enough bookings for his performers unless he signed up to the UBO, and a theater manager would have difficulty finding enough acts for his shows except by going through the UBO. The Western Vaudeville Managers Association (WVMA) came into existence when John J. Murdock of Chicago joined up with Beck and others, and blocked expansion of Albee's UBO to Chicago and the west. In a compromise, Martin Beck agreed to book acts for the Orpheum Circuit through the UBO. It was agreed that the WVMA would handle all bookings to the west of the Mississippi and the UBO would handle all bookings to the east. In Chicago the WVMA had arrangements with both the Keith-Albee and the Orpheum. This meant that acts could arrange coast-to-coast tours through one agency. In 1905 the Orpheum Circuit had seventeen theaters. By 1909 it had grown to twenty- seven theatres. Although the booking agreement held, the two main chains threatened to encroach on each other's territory. In 1911 Beck announced that he was building the Palace Theater on Broadway in Manhattan. In response Albee announced he was building theaters in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Only the Palace was built, and Albee and Keith managed to gain control of it. Albee had secretly acquired 51% of the Orpheum Circuit. In 1913 the WVMA included over ten circuits and supplied shows to over 300 theaters, mostly in the Midwest, South and West, although it advertised national coverage. The chains included the Orpheum, Gus Sun, Butterfield, Allardt, Theilen, Finn & Heiman and Interstate. The WVMA imposed strict rules, as did the Keith-Albee circuit, to ensure that the shows were suitable for family audiences. \\"Everything of a vulgar, suggestive, profane or sacrilegious nature is forbidden...\\" The USA had 2,973 large and small vaudeville theaters by 1913. By 1915 Keith-Albee controlled about 1,500 theaters through the UBO. They imposed their terms on acts, and disciplined those that were late or caused other problems. Most performers had to accept the conditions if they wanted to play big-time theaters. Union relations George Fuller Golden, founder of the White Rats Almost immediately after the VMA was founded the performers responded by forming a union named the White Rats, led by the comedian George Fuller Golden. The White Rats only admitted white males as members. The performers demanded abolition of the 5% commission and went on strike in 1901 after failed negotiations. The Western managers quickly accepted their conditions. Keith met with representatives of the performers and promised to arrange with the other managers for improved conditions. The strike fizzled out with only minor gains. In 1910 the White Rats was granted a charter by the American Federation of Labor led by Samuel Gompers. In 1911 Albee met with representatives of the Colored Vaudeville Benevolent Association. He told them there was no need for the colored artist to join a union to get work. The managers would look after their interests. Any artist who joined the union would be blacklisted. A hostile report of the meeting in the New York Age asked performers \\"Does Mr. Albee give you an equitable contract, or does he simply promise to do it? ... Does Mr. Albee treat you like he treats all other artist, like dirt...?\\" Albee had a blacklist prepared by John J. Murdock, now his general manager, of all known White Rats. None of them could be employed on a Keith or Orpheum circuit. The Vaudeville Managers Protective Association (VMPA) was formed to enforce the blacklist. Albee set up the National Vaudeville Artists (NVA) as an alternative union under his control. Performers who wanted bookings on the Keith or Orpheum circuits had to warrant that they were NVA members. In 1916 Harry Mountford of the White Rats organized a strike against the UBO that began in Oklahoma City and then spread to Boston and New York. The strikes failed and the White Rats went bankrupt. In May 1918 the Federal Trade Commission charged that the Vaudeville Managers Protective Association was an illegal combination operating in restraint of trade. It dominated big-time vaudeville, forced performers to pay excessive fees and punished union members through the blacklist. The FTC also named the NVA, UBO and the Keith Vaudeville Collection Agency. Marcus Loew, who had regional agencies for Famous Players and Universal Pictures, was seen as a co- conspirator by the government because many of the Keith theaters showed Loew- controlled films. The only result of the hearings was that the VMPA agreed to drop the requirement for a performer to belong to the NVA to obtain bookings. In 1919 Albee acquired the former White Rats clubhouse as NVA headquarters. In March 1924 an article in Equity magazine said the NVA \\"was formed so that the vaudeville artists could be herded into an organization under the control of the vaudeville managers. The N.V.A. is a lightning rod down which the collective strength of the vaudeville actor runs harmlessly into the ground.\\" In the 1920s a small hospital/lodge was built in Saranac Lake, New York, for performers ailing from tuberculosis and other respiratory ailments. Later a larger hospital was built in the mid to late 1920s. It was called the National Vaudeville Artist Lodge. After the NVA went bankrupt and merged with what later became RKO in the 1930s, the hospital was renamed the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital. The Tudor mansion still stands today as a retirement home. It was painstakingly restored and looks exactly as it did when it was originally built. Funds for the building and the upkeep of the hospital were raising through annual benefits in which many artists performed. To commemorate these efforts, souvenir books were created, featuring photographs of the many performers, a list of who was performing, cartoons, and poems written by performers. Decline and dissolution In 1929 the National Vaudeville Artists was taken in a hostile move by Joseph Kennedy. He kept Albee only as a figure head. One day Albee had a idea and was immediately told \\"You are nothing\\" A year and half later Albee died. Some of the theaters began offering combinations of film and vaudeville, or film only. This mix of film and vaudeville remained popular for many years. By 1925 the Albee-Keith chain was down to 350 theaters. By 1926 there were only twelve theaters dedicated to big-time vaudeville. In 1927 the Orpheum merged with the Keith-Albee chain. In October 1928 the consolidated Keith-Albee-Orpheum company combined with the Radio Corporation of America and the Film Booking Office. The new company was called Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO). The former vaudeville theaters became cinemas.

He had instead to be stabbed and killed with bayonets by the members of the firing squad after resisting to be shot in the back, a punishment commonly reserved for traitors.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building, the lowest of its three grades of listing. History The church was built in 1857‚Äì58 to a design by James Hibbert and Nathan Rainford. It was for many years an active church, but has been redundant since 2011. The church was advertised for sale in 2011, at a price of ¬£500,000. Reverend Phil Jump said the building had a basement which had been home to many voluntary groups and that it would be \\"a shame to see them without a base\\". The church was for a number of years the focal point for outreach activities for the homeless in the city. Architecture =Exterior= Fishergate Baptist Church is built in sandstone with slate roofs, and is in Italian Romanesque style. It has a rectangular plan, is in two storeys with a basement, and has a symmetrical entrance front facing the street. Eight steps lead up to a double doorway, each door having an arch in Mozarabic style, and both contained in a round-headed arch. Flanking the doorway are two round-arched windows on each side. The doorways and windows have pilasters with carved imposts, and above them is a cornice. The upper part of the entrance front contains corner pilasters and a pediment, the pediment containing a large wheel window and two smaller ones, all with hood moulds. The rear of the church is gabled; the gable also contains a large wheel window, and two two-light mullioned windows. Along the sides of the church are gabled projections, each containing a pair of windows. At the southeast corner of the church is a tower. In the ground floor of the tower is a round-arched doorway, in the first stage is a single lancet window, and in the second stage are pairs of lancets; all of these are in Mozarabic style. On each side of the third stage there is a clock face with a pair of oculi above, all with hood moulds. Over these is a cornice with carvings of birds projecting from the corners, and a tall pyramidal roof. =Interior= Steeply pointed arcades inside the church are carried on square piers. Doors at the far end of the building are flanked by foliated shafts, and a gallery with cast iron balusters. The church also contains monuments to members of the Sellrers family, dating from the late 19th century. The two-manual pipe organ was made by Henry Ainscough of Preston in 1870, and repaired by the same company in 1954; its case is decorated with putti. Appraisal The church was designated a Grade II listed building on 29 January 1986, the lowest of its three grades of listing that is applied to buildings that are \\"nationally important and of special interest\\". Hartwell and Pevsner in the Buildings of England series comment that the tower is \\"rather starved\\".

It was a short-lived denomination in copper, being minted in only 1797 by Matthew Boulton's Soho Mint. These coins were made legal tender for amounts of up to one shilling by a proclamation of 26 July 1797. Short-lived twopence coins in silver were also minted in 1817, 1818 and 1820. Twopence coins were made redundant in 1860 with the advent of bronze coinage. History The minting of silver pennies for general circulation was halted by the British government in 1660, because the cost of silver had risen too high. By the late 1700s this policy had caused a deficiency in the number of circulating pennies, and many merchants and mining companies had taken to issuing their own copper tokens. For example, the Parys Mining Company on Anglesey issued huge numbers of tokens (although their acceptability was limited). To alleviate this coin shortage, in 1797, the government authorised Matthew Boulton to strike copper pennies and twopences at his Soho Mint, in Birmingham. As it was a requirement that a coin's face value should correspond to the value of the base metal, each was made from two pence worth of copper (2 ounces), making the coins significantly larger than earlier pennies which had been struck in silver. Their large size, combined with the thick rim, led to the nickname \\"cartwheels\\". All \\"cartwheel\\" twopences are marked with the date 1797. In total, around 720,000 such coins were minted. By 1802, the production of privately issued provincial tokens had ceased. However, in the next ten years the intrinsic value of copper rose. The return of privately minted token coinage was evident by 1811, and became endemic by 1812 as more and more of the Government-issued copper coinage was melted down for trade. The Royal Mint undertook a massive recoinage programme in 1816, with large quantities of gold and silver coin being minted. To thwart the further issuance of private tokens, in 1817 an Act of Parliament was passed which forbade their manufacture under severe penalties. A short-lived twopence denomination in silver was also produced, with circulation issues in 1817, 1818 and 1820, after which silver twopence coins were issued only as Maundy money. In 1857, a survey by the Royal Mint found that around one-third of all copper coinage had become worn or mutilated, often by advertisements. A couple of years later Thomas Graham, the Master of the Mint, convinced William Ewart Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, that so large a proportion of copper coinage must be taken out of circulation that it was worth introducing an entirely new coinage which would be \\"much more convenient and agreeable in use\\". New bronze coins were introduced in 1860, with a face value that was no longer required to match the value of the base metal. A year later withdrawal of the old copper coinage began. Design Coin edge of the 1797 twopence, George III The 1797 coin was minted in copper, with a weight of and a diameter of . The obverse features a right-facing portrait of George III, and incused into the rim are the words . The initial K appears on the lowest fold of the drapery at the base of the effigy, indicating that the design is the work of the German engraver Conrad Heinrich K√ºchler. The reverse, also designed by Kuchler, shows a left-facing seated figure of Britannia, with a trident held loosely in her left hand, and an olive branch in her outstretched right. There are waves about her feet, with a small ship to the left and a Union Jack shield below and to the right. On the upper part of the rim is incused the word , and on the lower part the date . The word appears next to the shield, indicating that the coin came from the Soho Mint.

The game was announced via an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in 2013 and released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux on 14 August 2020 following a four-year long early access phase. The game follows an engineer who crash-landed on an alien planet and must harvest resources and create industry to build a rocket; however, as an open-world game, players can continue the game past the end of the storyline. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes. Gameplay Factorio is a construction and management simulation game focused on resource-gathering with real-time strategy and survival elements and influences from the BuildCraft and IndustrialCraft mods for the video game Minecraft. The player survives by locating and harvesting resources to craft various tools and machines, which in turn create more advanced materials that allow for the progression to more sophisticated technologies and machines. The game progresses as the player continues to build and manage their automated factory-style system, which automates the mining, transportation, processing, and assembly of resources and products. Players research advanced technologies that allow them to create new structures, items, and upgrades, starting with basic automation and eventually leading to oil refining, robots, and powered exoskeletons. The current version of the game is formally \\"won\\" by launching a rocket, although choosing to ignore this goal and instead continue building a factory is possible, as Factorio is an open world game. Construction of a rocket requires massive amounts of resources, motivating the player to set up a sizable, effective factory in order to achieve this goal. =Combat= The player is concerned with defending themselves and their factory from the planet's indigenous fauna, known as 'Biters', 'Spitters', and 'Worms', who become increasingly hostile as pollutant emissions created by the player's factory increase, necessitating consideration of the balance between the player's production and the enemy's aggressiveness. The player can utilize defensive turrets, tanks, and other weapons to eliminate enemies. As the game progresses, enemies evolve and become harder to defeat. =Multiplayer= Multiplayer mode allows people to play together cooperatively or versus one another both locally and via the Internet. Factorio supports both dedicated servers as well as player-hosted listen servers. In the past, the game used peer-to-peer connectivity, however this was removed as more robust options were developed. Saved world files can be seamlessly loaded in either single- or multiplayer. By default, all players on a server share technologies, unless a system of multiple teams has been instituted by the server host. Friendly fire is present. While the hard limit for players is 65,535 due to limitations of the SOCKET protocol, this number has never been reached; the most popular servers were able to successfully handle several hundred players at once. Players can share construction blueprints with other players on their server, via a public blueprint library. =Modding= Factorio is designed to be customisable via mods to create additional content, such as modifications to gameplay or re-texturing of visual elements. The developers offer an online portal on the Factorio website for mod developers to host their content. To help support the modding community, there is an in-game mod manager that allows players to quickly download them. Mods are written in Lua. Development The game has been developed by a team of developers from Prague, Czech Republic, since mid 2012. The development team originally consisted of a single person, but has grown larger. Wube Software was created in September 2014 by Michal Kova≈ô√≠k and Tom√°≈° Kozelek in Prague. To fund the game the development team began an Indiegogo campaign, which started on 31 January 2013 and concluded on 3 March 2013. The campaign raised ‚Ç¨21,626 of the ‚Ç¨17,000 goal. Following the crowdfunding success, Wube sold early access editions of the game to raise further funds. The developer credits the April 2014 release of the game's trailer as a significant driver of those sales. As of July 2017, the team consists of 15 members. Michal Kova≈ô√≠k, the game's lead designer, cited the IndustrialCraft and BuildCraft Minecraft mods for inspiration during the game's development. The game was released in early access on 25 February 2016. It was officially released out of early access on 14 August 2020. It was originally planned to be released on 25 September 2020, but was moved up a month as to not compete with the release of Cyberpunk 2077, which, at the time, was scheduled to be released on 17 September 2020. =G2A Audit= Video game key reseller G2A was accused of selling stolen keys on their site, affecting developers of games, specifically in the indie scene. On July 5 2019, G2A offered to pay the developers of a game ten times the worth of the stolen game keys if the problem could be proven via audit. Wube was the only developer to call on this, stating \\"G2A - worse than piracy\\" and emailed a list of 321 canceled Steam keys due to chargebacks. After over ten months, G2A confirmed 198 of those keys were sold on the platform and paid Wube Software $39,600 as part of the promise. Due to the sensitive nature of the investigation, the independent audit was instead done internally.  Reception  Factorio received positive reception from critics while still in early access. In the 2018 Steam Awards, Factorio was voted by Steam users as a runner-up in the \\"Most Fun with a Machine\\" category. By 2020, the game had sold two million copies. Upon its release in 2020, Factorio received positive reviews. Rick Lane of PC Gamer praised Factorio, calling it \\"a manufacturing masterpiece\\". Nicolas Perez of Paste praised Factorio's use of early access, stating, \\"...Factorio has set an example of what the Early Access system is truly capable of.\\"  Legacy  Neobuthus factorio is a species of scorpion from the family Buthidae found in Somaliland.

She was estimated by some whale researchers to have been 105 years old, but her age is a source of dispute, with other studies putting her at age 65-80. If she was 105, she would have been the oldest known orca at the time of her death. A member of the endangered southern resident killer whale population, Granny lived in the northeast Pacific Ocean and coastal bays of Washington state and British Columbia. Granny was estimated to have been born in 1911. She was last seen on October 12, 2016, and was considered deceased by The Center for Whale Research in January 2017. Description The unique dorsal fin of J2 Granny, showing her half-moon notch, taken as she swam through Haro Strait in Washington State in 2007 Granny was recognizable from the gray \\"saddle patch\\" just behind her dorsal fin, and a half-moon notch in her fin. Simon Pidcock of Ocean EcoVentures said he had seen Granny thousands of times, and that the markings on orca fins were like fingerprints. Granny had been captured with the rest of her pod in 1967 but was too old at that time for a marine mammal park and so was released. Now that orca studies have been conducted for several decades, the exact age of many younger whales is known. The age of older orcas, such as Granny, is estimated by their offspring; they give birth around age 15, and stop having offspring around 40; by adding the generations together, ages can be estimated. Granny was photographed in 1971 with a male orca, J1 Ruffles, who was believed at the time to be her son. Ruffles was estimated as at least 20 years old, and as scientists believed him to be Granny's last offspring, her own age was estimated at about 60. It was later discovered that Ruffles was not Granny's son, but her age estimate was never changed. Granny's age was originally estimated with a margin of error of 12 years, but was the subject of an academic dispute in 2016 due to her original age being based on evidence now known to be incorrect, as well as a large disparity between the life expectancy of orcas with estimated ages and orcas with known ages. Analysis of fatty acids from a recent biopsy of Granny indicated that Granny may have only been 65‚Äì80 years of age. J pod Granny, along with several of her descendants, travelled in the J pod, a group of about 25 orcas. J pod, along with Pods K and L, are the \\"J clan\\", which constitute the entire southern resident killer whale population. They frequent the inland waters of British Columbia and Washington state in the summer months, but roam from southeast Alaska to central California. They have completed a journey as far as in a week. As the oldest female in J pod, Granny would have been considered its leader. A well-known male orca previously thought to be Granny's son is J1 Ruffles. He was last seen in 2010. As of 2012, none of Granny's immediate children are known to be living. However, Granny had multiple grandchildren and great-grandchildren who travelled in the pod with her. The southern resident killer whales are the most studied population of orcas in the world. Many whales in this population were captured in the 1960s and 1970s for use in sea parks, and others were killed by hunters attempting to capture them. The southern resident orcas are the smallest of four resident communities from the Northeastern portion of the Pacific Ocean. It is the only orca population listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, and as of 2005 this group is protected under the Endangered Species Act. Legacy As the longest living known orca, Granny is employed as an example in arguments against keeping whales in captivity, referencing the allegedly reduced lifespan of captive animals. The oldest orca in captivity is the 50-year-old Lolita who is at the Miami Seaquarium. The average lifespan for a captured orca is 20 to 30 years. Granny was also used as a focal point of environmental efforts that resulted in the Endangered Species Act protections for orca. Environmentalists estimate that Granny may have had a PCB load of up to 100 parts per million, and that her descendants' reproductive systems may have been damaged by exposure to pollution. Additionally, declining West Coast salmon populations put Granny and her family at risk. Granny was featured in a children's book on orcas by Sally Hodson titled Granny's Clan: A Tale of Wild Orcas. Shortly after Granny's death was announced, BBC Radio 4's Inside Science discussed the insights into killer whales and their social lives which the prolonged observations of Granny and her pod had revealed. Granny is the subject of a short documentary film. The Hundred Year Old Whale was released in 2017 by filmmaker Mark Leiren-Young, the author of The Killer Whale Who Changed The World. Orca lifespan Estimates of lifespans for wild orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30‚Äì50 years for females, and 19‚Äì30 years for males. These estimates depart from the findings of a 2005 study, which pegged the mean age of females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans, with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years. Orcas are one of the few species to exhibit menopause and Granny's great age gave her a chance to use her skills to enhance the reproductive success of her offspring (see Grandmother hypothesis).

Meriam Ibrahim was arrested during her second pregnancy for apostasy and gave birth to a girl in prison on 27 May 2014.Sudanese woman facing death for apostasy gives birth, BBC, 27 May 2014 Mariam Ibrahim's case is part of a wider problem of persecution of Christians in Sudan. Meriam Ibrahim was born to a Muslim father, who left her Ethiopian Orthodox mother to raise her from early childhood. She was raised in her mother's faith and married a Christian man; the marriage certificate has been published. Meriam Ibrahim was reportedly turned in to the authorities by one of her relatives, who claimed Mariam was committing adultery by marrying Daniel Wani, a Christian. She was sentenced to death on 15 May 2014, for allegedly committing apostasy from Islam, meaning that she was accused of changing religion from Islam to a different (or no) religion. Although Meriam Ibrahim said she has always been a Christian, the prosecution claimed she should have followed the faith of her absent father, and demanded, with the support of the judge, that she abandon her Christian faith, and assent to belief in her father's faith, Islam. She was given three days to convert, but refused, arguing that she had been a Christian all her life, and could not rescind or alter her genuine personal faith at the request of a court. Her husband, Daniel Wani, appealed the sentence on both of their behalf. On 24 June 2014 Meriam Ibrahim was released on the order of a Sudanese appeal court. The following day, as she and her family were to board a plane to the United States, they were arrested and taken from the airport to Khartoum for questioning following a tip-off to the police by her half- brother.Alexander, Harriet (25 June 2014) Meriam Ibrahim was 'kidnapped' and I went to police before she boarded flight to America, her brother says The Telegraph, Retrieved 27 June 2014 The US Ambassador was summoned in protest at the granting of an exit visa, described by the Sudanese Foreign Ministry as 'a criminal violation'. Meriam Ibrahim was freed again on 26 June 2014 and took refuge in the United States embassy with her family. After extensive negotiations to enable her to leave Sudan, Meriam Ibrahim arrived in Rome on 24 July 2014 on an Italian government plane. Background Because Islamic law does not allow marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men, Meriam Ibrahim's marriage to a Christian man was considered void by the court, based on its belief that she should not have been raised as a Christian, or chosen that faith. Therefore, the court argued that, although a lifelong Christian, she should notionally be treated as a Muslim, and that the marriage to the Christian man was not valid. She was therefore also sentenced to receive 100 lashes for adultery, in spite of the sexual relations having been only with her husband, with the flogging to be administered some time in advance of being hanged. Moreover, her 20-month-old son was also imprisoned, and was initially denied all contact with his father, who would never have been permitted to raise him. Three of the boy's four grandparents ‚Äì both his paternal grandparents, and his maternal grandmother ‚Äì were Christian from birth, as were his parents ‚Äì but the authorities have stated that as the absentee maternal grandfather that he never met was a Muslim, he therefore could not legally be raised by his Christian father. In response, Meriam Ibrahim said that she has always been a Christian and never committed apostasy. Her half-brother, Al Samani Al Hadi Mohamed Abdullah, admitted he had instigated the charges against her and maintained she should be executed.Weber, Katherine (5 June 2014) Sudanese Mother Meriam Ibrahim 'Should Be Executed' for Christian Faith, Brother Says The Christian Post, Retrieved 25 June 2014 Meriam Ibrahim's husband and her lawyers have alleged that her half-brother and half-sister had turned her in because they wanted to take over Meriam Ibrahim's successful businesses, which included a hair salon, agricultural land and a general convenience store in a shopping mall.Starkey, Jerome (25 June 2014) Meriam rearrested as she tries to leave Sudan The Times, (may need a subscription) retrieved 25 June 2014Jones, Leigh and Derrick, J.C.

Visitors were Initially not allowed; when her husband finally saw Meriam Ibrahim, she was shackled and had swollen legs. Muslim scholars visited her daily reciting the Koran and trying to pressure her to convert. Vital medical treatment was refused, and Meriam Ibrahim was denied transfer to a hospital even though she was 8 months into a difficult pregnancy. Even during childbirth, her legs were kept shackled to the floor and there were fears the baby girl might be permanently disabled due to this. The shackles were removed after the birth. Mohamed Jar Elnabi, a lawyer representing Meriam Ibrahim, said police and the judge prevented her husband, Wani, going into the court. Elnabi said Wani is wheelchair-bound due to muscular dystrophy and \\"totally depends on her for all details of his life, he cannot live without her\\". Speaking about the couple's son Martin Wani, Elnabi said, \\"The couple's son is having a difficult time in prison. He is very affected from being trapped inside a prison from such a young age, he is always getting sick due to lack of hygiene and bugs.\\" Reports that Meriam Ibrahim may be freed(5 June 2014) Sudan‚Äôs PCP expects al-Mahdi to be released very soon Sudan Tribune, Retrieved 5 June 2014 were subsequently officially denied. However, on 24 June 2014, Meriam Ibrahim was released on the order of a Sudanese appeal court. The following day, as she and her family were to board a plane to the United States, she and her family were arrested and taken from the airport to Khartoum for questioning. Authorities stated that she was not under arrest, but that the police wished to question her about the validity of a travel document provided to her by South Sudan. Daniel Wani claims in a report from Christian Today the family and supporters were violently handled, the lawyers were beaten and thrown out of the airport. Following their release, the family spent a month in the U.S. embassy in Khartoum. Defense lawyers Meriam was represented by five lawyers: Mohaned Mustafa Elnour, Osman Mobarak Musa, Thabit Elzobair Suliman, Elshareef Ali Mohammed, Mohamed Abdunabi. The case has also been taken to the African Commission on people's Human Rights. Reactions The United Kingdom government described the sentence as \\"barbaric\\" and a UK minister was \\"truly appalled\\", noting that Sudan breached international human rights obligations. The United States government was \\"deeply disturbed\\" and also called on Sudan to meet its obligations under international human rights law. A joint statement from embassies of Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United States before sentencing also expressed \\"deep concern\\", urging \\"justice and compassion\\". Daniel Wani, Mariam's husband, has expressed disappointment at a lack of U.S. resoluteness, at the consulate level: \\"Considering I am an American citizen, I am disappointed with the American Embassy's position from the beginning of the whole case.\\" The lengthy public silence of both President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry on their case drew widespread criticism. Kerry broke this silence on 12 June, after bipartisan lobbying. Christian groups have been campaigning for Meriam Ibrahim but Islamic extremists also lobbied according to prominent newspaper editor Khalid Tigani. A lawyer for Meriam Ibrahim said the case would, if necessary, have gone to Sudan's highest Constitutional Court. Sudan's 2005 interim constitution officially guarantees freedom of religion. The Information Minister of Sudan, Ahmed Bilal Osman, appeared to comment on the court case prior to the appeal, when he said: \\"It's not only Sudan. In Saudi Arabia, in all the Muslim countries, it is not allowed at all for a Muslim to change his religion.\\" Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a British-based group working for religious freedom, said Ms. Ishag's case is the latest amongst \\"a series of repressive acts\\" against religious minorities in Sudan.RT√â News and Current Affairs World Council of Churches general secretary, Dr Olav Fykse Tveit considers the sentence unjust and reminds president Omar al-Bashir, the Sudanese constitution guarantees all citizens the \\"right to the freedom of religious creed and worship\\". Amnesty UK's Individuals at Risk Campaigner, Kathy Voss, stated: \\"There are now three innocent people in that cell. The way Meriam has been treated is sickening, and it has appalled the world. This really is the stuff of nightmares.\\" British Conservative MP Liam Fox said: \\"Religious tolerance is something that the UK should be promoting at every opportunity. We need to ask ourselves whether it is acceptable to be giving taxpayers' money in aid to states which allow treatment such as that handed out to Meriam Ibrahim.\\" In May 2014, the embassies of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands issued a joint statement expressing \\"deep concern\\" about the case, urging Sudan to respect the right to freedom of religion. The European Union called for revocation of the \\"inhuman verdict\\" and John Kerry urged Sudan to repeal laws banning Muslims from joining other faiths. Prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan wrote, \\"There is no value in worship performed in the absence of free choice and volition.\\" Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director Sarah Jackson said: \\"Today's ruling is a small step to redressing the injustice done to Meriam.\\" The Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, mentioned Ibrahim's case in his speech at the European Parliament. After that, The EU passed a Resolution condemning Sudan over treatment of Meriam Ibrahim. Wider problems Some have argued that this case may serve as a distraction against complaints the Sudanese people make about their government. Mohamed Ghilan, an expert in Islamic jurisprudence, claims, \\"The punishment has little to do with religion and serves as a political distraction. This is a ploy by the Sudanese regime to appear as 'defenders of Islam' to mitigate their corruption\\". Sudan has been noted by the Corruption Perceptions index as being one of the world's most corrupt. However execution is widely prescribed as an appropriate punishment for women and men leaving Islam in Saudi Arabia and in on-line Islamic websites, commonly citing a well attested quotation of Muhammed to Ibn Abbas, \\"Whoever renounces his religion, kill him.\\"Sahih Al-Bukhari, \\"Bab Hukm al Murtad wa al Murtadah\\", Vol. 8, pp. 50, 163; Al Muwata', \\"Kitab al Hudud\\", Vol. 2, p. 736; Sunan Al Tirmidhi, \\"Kitab al Hudud\\", Vol. 4, p. 48; Sunan Abi Daud, \\"Kitab al Hudud\\", Vol. 4, p. 126; Sunan Ibn Majah, \\"Kitab al Hudud\\" Vol. 2, p. 848; Sunan AL Nasaee \\"Al Hukm fi al Murtad\\", Vol. 7, pp. 103-104; Al Musnad, \\"Musnad 'Abd Allah b.

It has, for example, been a view commonly held by young Muslims in the UK, as well as Meriam's own family. Departure from Sudan After Meriam and her family took refuge in the US Embassy, the Italian government offered help to speed up the process of getting U.S. passports, given its good relation with Sudan, and vice-minister for foreign affairs Lapo Pistelli flew to the Sudanese capital to that end. Two weeks later vice-minister Pistelli accompanied the family back to Italy on a government plane which took off from Khartoum, and they were welcomed in Rome by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini. Pope Francis had expressed \\"his gratitude and joy\\" to the Italian Government when he was informed by Renzi of the family's arrival. Later in that day, Meriam and her family met the Pontiff at his residence of Casa Santa Marta in Vatican City for about half an hour, during which she thanked the Catholic Church for their support and prayers, while the Pope thanked her and her family for their \\"courageous and constant witness of faith\\". Current situation The family lived in New Hampshire a in the United States for 25 months and moved to Virginia where they live now. Meriam Ibrahim is advocating for other victims of religious persecution and women who face gender based violence and domestic abuse.

It studies fundamental role played by the diagram in the communication and creation of knowledge. Diagrammatology is not only an interdisciplinary subject, but pan-historical and cross-cultural. Overview The term diagrammatology is often used synonymously with diagrammatics, however diagrammatics tends to be more common place within the fields of Mathematics (especially logic), the sciences and technology. In contrast, diagrammatology is currently the term of choice for the arts and humanities, where it is closely associated with Charles Sanders Peirce's work on diagrammatic reasoning. In the introduction to his seminal 2011 work \\"Diagrammatology\\", Frederik Stjernfelt describes the reasoning behind his use of the term: \\"As a substitute for the neologism of 'diagrammatology', the title might equally have well have been 'diagrammatical reasoning'. But two things argued against such a choice: (1) a book with that title already exists (Glasgow et al. 1995, on the reemergence of diagrammatic representations in computer science), and, consequently (2) the close association of that title with diagrams in computer science specifically.\\" Frederik, Stjernfelt (2010). Diagrammatology: An Investigation on the Borderlines of Phenomenology, Ontology, and Semiotics. Synthese Library. p. 425. . Lay summary (PDF). Stjernfelt attributes the term diagrammatology to the art historian W.J.T Mitchell, who, in a 1981 article entitled \\"Diagrammatology\\" writes of the need for \\"‚Ä¶something like a diagrammatology, a systematic study of the way that relationships among elements are represented and interpreted by graphic constructions\\" WTJ Mitchell, 1981, Diagrammatology, In: Critical Inquiry, Spring 1981, Vol. 7 nr. 3, 622-33 The term diagrammatology was also used in the title of the 2010 publication \\"Studies in Diagrammatology and Diagram Praxis\\" by Olga Pombo and Alexander Gerner. This volume is a collection of papers given at the interdisciplinary workshop on diagrammatology and diagram praxis held at the University of Lisbon, 23 ‚Äì 24 March 2009. The workshop was organised by the Research Project \\"Images in Science\\" of the centre for Philosophy of Science of the University of Lisbon (CFCUL), aiming to analyse the place of image and diagrammatic thinking in different epistemological and semiotic programs.Pombo, Olga and garner, Alexander (2010), Studies in Diagrammatology and Diagram Praxis, Studies in Logic, volume 24, College Publications, London.

It continued the goals of the Revolution of the Park of 1890, whose themes were further echoed in the Revolution of 1905. In 1890, Bartolom√© Mitre and Leandro N. Alem formed the Civic Union, which orchestrated the Revolution of the Park and forced the resignation of president Miguel √Ångel Ju√°rez Celman of the PAN in favor of his vice president, Carlos Pellegrini. Mitre himself stood for president for the 1892 elections, but sought accommodation with the PAN, leading Alem to break off and found the UCR in 1891. On April 2, 1892, barely a week before the election, Pellegrini declared a state of siege and arrested Alem and other opposition leaders, resulting in the overwhelming election of PAN candidate Luis S√°enz Pe√±a. In the aftermath, the UCR split into factions led by Alem (los l√≠ricos, \\"the Lyricists\\") and by his nephew and prot√©g√©, Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen (los rojos, \\"the Reds\\"). Yrigoyen and his political brother Arist√≥bulo del Valle believed the UCR should take power through provincial rebellions, as opposed to a coup d'√©tat of the national government.Cabral, 536 First phase: July‚ÄìAugust Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen, conducted the revolution in Buenos Aires Province and installed a revolutionary governor. In 1893, with his government weak, S√°enz Pe√±a invited del Valle to serve as Minister of War, with additional functions giving him almost the power of a prime minister. This presented an unbeatable opportunity for the UCR. The first armed insurrection began on July 28 in San Luis Province, directed by Te√≥filo Saa. The revolutionaries quickly took control, forcing the governor to resign and installing Saa as interim governor. A second insurrection broke out in Santa Fe on July 30. After several days of bloody fighting, the revolutionaries, led by Lisandro de la Torre and others, defeated the provincial government, headed by Juan Manuel Cafferata‚Äîone of the few PAN members who had assumed power legitimately. On August 4, they installed radical Mariano Candioti as governor. The rebellion in Buenos Aires Province, led by Yrigoyen himself, was the largest and best-organized.Cabral, 538 It began simultaneously in 82 cities, at dawn on July 30. The radical army ended up with 8,000 well-armed men,Cabral, 540 under the direct command of Marcelo T. de Alvear at first and Martin Yrigoyen later. Their headquarters was in Temperley, in the vicinity of the city of Buenos Aires. The revolution triumphed everywhere in the province. On August 8 they took the capital and installed as interim governor Juan Carlos Belgrano. Soon after, however, they made several strategic errors. First, del Valle (supported by Yrigoyen) refused to depose S√°enz Pe√±a in a coup, as demanded by Alem and most of the other radical leaders. He proposed instead a plan for free elections which was approved by the Senate but defeated in the Chamber of Deputies. Second, Yrigoyen freed Pelligrini, who had been arrested in Haedo by the revolutionaries. Once released, Pellegrini returned to the capital and rallied PAN supporters. Third, del Valle left the Casa Rosada for Temperley, to be present at the surrender of arms. On August 11, Pelligrini and Julio Argentino Roca took the opportunity to go to the Congress and win support for the suppression of the insurrections in Buenos Aires, San Luis and Santa Fe, all held by revolutionary governments. Alem urged del Valle to lead the radical army back to Buenos Aires and stage a coup.Luna, 106 Instead, del Valle resigned from the cabinet on August 12, being replaced by roquista Manuel Quintana. On August 25 the State Committee of the Radical Civic Union decided to surrender their weapons and the revolution effectively stopped. Second phase: August 14‚ÄìSeptember On August 14, 1893, two days after the resignation of Arist√≥bulo del Valle, an uprising in Corrientes Province ousted the governor there. Alem, considering the revolution far from defeated, and anticipating a massive uprising, decided to start out from Rosario. Yrigoyen, however, felt this movement was not well-grounded and denied the support of the Radical army, a move the Radical remnant considered a betrayal. The Alem- led uprising was poorly conceived and poorly organized. On September 7, radical commander Bello revolted in Tucum√°n Province and imposed a revolutionary government under Eugenio Mendez. On September 24, Candioti returned to Santa Fe at the head of a combined army of regulars and irregulars. The national government decided to respond firmly and sent a powerful army under Pelligrini, who obtained the surrender of the revolutionary on September 25. Alem arrived the same day in Rosario, having hidden in a cargo ship, to great acclaim, with a popular assembly declaring him president of the nation and an army of 6,000 being raised. On September 26, the crew of the El Plata-class monitor ARA Los Andes, en route from Tigre to Santa Fe with arms to support the government troops, mutinied, led by frigate lieutenant Gerardo Valotta. Valotta sailed the ship to Rosario and gave the arms to the insurrectionist army instead. Manuel Garc√≠a Mansilla, commanding the torpedo ship ARA Espora, engaged the Los Andes in the Battle of El Espinillo on September 29, on the Paran√° River north of Rosario. The riverine battleship ARA Independencia under the command of Edelmiro Correa joined the battle, soon forcing the Los Andes to retreat into the harbor. Valotta surrendered early the next morning. Roca assumed command of the army at Rosario, threatened to bombard the city unless the rebels surrendered. Alem fled, with the remaining rebels surrendering to Garcia Mansilla and Correa, effectively putting an end to the Revolution. Alem was captured on October 1 and imprisoned for six months. He stood in the 1894 legislative elections, becoming national deputy in 1895, but committed suicide the following July. Statue of Leandro Alem in Rosario, Argentina.

It was built from 1996 to 2001 in the BMW Berlin plant in Spandau, together with several sister models of similar design, including the R1100R, R1100GS and R1100RS, with almost identical engines but different engine tunes, trim levels and chassis details.  General  The R1100RT was released in 1996 as a successor to the R100RT. In addition to extensive changes to the full fairing, the engine power was increased significantly from 44 to 66 kW (60 to 90 hp), and the capacity increased from 971 cc to 1085 cc. It has a bore of 99 mm, a stroke of 70.5 mm, and a compression ratio of 10.7:1. Top speed is 211 km/h, and the time to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h is 3.9 seconds. The bike comes standard with an anti-lock braking system and a regulated three-way catalytic converter. The chassis is constructed in three parts and consists of front and rear frame and a co-supporting ligands motor- gear unit. The suspension was formed on the front by a Telelever and the rear via a Paralever swingarm. The fuel tank holds 25.2 liters (6.6 gallons), 6 liters (1.5 gallons) reserve. The average fuel consumption is 3.9 liters per 100 km (~60mpg) at a speed of 86 km/h (~55mph) or 4.7 liters (50mpg) at 120 km/h (75mph). The manufacturer recommends the use of petrol with a knock resistance of at least 95 RON / 91 octane. The front tyres have the dimensions 120/70 ZR 17 and rear 160/60 ZR 18. The bike weighs 285 kg (628lbs) in running order and has a maximum additional payload of 205 kg (452 lb). In 2001, the R1100RT was superseded by the R1150RT.

Established as a fighter and torpedo-bomber training unit in Australia at the end of World War Two, it was briefly reformed as a helicopter squadron in the early 1950s, before becoming a helicopter training unit in 1962, and operating until 1998. First formation The squadron was formed in the UK in January 1945 and sailed for Australia where it was officially commissioned on 10 April 1945 at RNAS Schofields () near Schofields, New South Wales. It operated as a refresher training and conversion unit for the British Pacific Fleet, flying the Grumman Avenger, Fairey Barracuda, Vought Corsair, Fairey Firefly, Grumman Hellcat and Supermarine Seafire. In late August, following the surrender of Japan, the unit was transferred to a base at Maryborough, Queensland, and in October moved again to at Nowra, New South Wales. In January 1946 the unit returned to Schofields, and was disbanded on 31 May 1946. Second formation The squadron was reformed at RNAS Gosport on 7 September 1953 flying the Westland Whirlwind HAS.22 ASW helicopter and the Hiller HT.1. In October 1953 it moved to Northern Ireland, firstly to RNAS Sydenham near Belfast, then in February 1954 to RNAS Eglinton, being occasionally based aboard . The squadron was disbanded on 1 March 1954, and its aircraft were transferred to 845 Naval Air Squadron. Third formation In January 1962 the squadron was reformed for a second time as a helicopter training unit at RNAS Culdrose flying the Westland Wessex HAS.1. 706 Squadron's B Flight was formed at Culdrose on 7 January 1964 and equipped with the Wessex and Hiller HT.2 to operate in the Commando Assault role, but was incorporated into 845 Squadron when it arrived in Borneo to take part in the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. In November 1964 the squadron received Westland Wasp HAS.1's for advanced training. In January 1970 it converted to the Westland Sea King HAS.1, and in February 1975 Wasp training was transferred to 703 Squadron.

TEY is considered to be a sub-category of Theatre for Young Audiences (TYA). TEY is known in the US as Theatre for the Very Young, or TVY. It has been defined as ‚Äúprofessional theatre led by adults performing for an audience of babies from months old to toddlers approximately one and a half to two years old accompanied by a parent or adult companion.

Chris Speyer, founder of radical children‚Äôs theatre company Theatre Kit, described the epiphany which led to the earliest experiments in TEY: > The move into under fives theatre was prompted by an occasion when we took > [Speyer‚Äôs wife] Katherine [Ukleja]'s niece Annie, then aged three, to see a > performance of one of our shows for children. Finding that various aspects > of the show frightened Annie, Katherine decided that we should develop a > form of theatre tailored to the needs, interests and concentration spans of > under fives.Speyer, C (2004).

He served as the head coach at St. John's University, Fordham University, and the United States Military Academy and amassed an overall career record of 257 wins and 105 losses. During his tenure at Fordham, Kelleher installed a fast-pace offense that prioritized high- scoring games modeled after the west coast style of play (the east coast played a slower, more defensive-oriented brand of basketball). He coached the famous \\"Wonder Fives\\", the teams between 1924 and 1929 who lost only nine total games. During a three-year stretch between 1926‚Äì27 and 1928‚Äì29, his Rams went 48‚Äì4. They were named \\"Eastern champions\\" all three years. Kelleher's other highlights as the Rams coach include coaching their first two All- Americans, Frank Dougherty and Bob Mullens, as well as guiding the school to its first-ever postseason tournament. In 1942‚Äì43, his last season at Fordham, he led the Rams to a fourth-place finish in the 1943 National Invitation Tournament. When Fordham temporarily dropped their basketball program due to World War II, Kelleher signed a short-term contract with the Military Academy to be their head coach. The plan was to return to Fordham once they re- commissioned a basketball team. In his first season at Army, his team finished the season with a 15‚Äì0 record and was retroactively named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Then, in 1944‚Äì45, his Army squad went 14‚Äì1, giving his two-year head coaching tenure at Army an overall record of 29‚Äì1. He coached Dale Hall, a consensus All-American who later became the head men's basketball coach at New Hampshire and the head football coach at Army. After the 1944‚Äì45 season ended, Kelleher went to Europe as a civilian with the United States Armed Forces. He was killed on July 19, 1945 in Munich, Germany.

Her bones were part of a 2007 discovery of a cache of animal bones in an underwater chamber called Hoyo Negro (Spanish for \\"Black Hole\\") in the Sistema Sac Actun. At the time of Naia's death, the cave system was mostly dry, and she likely died falling into Hoyo Negro. The remains have been described as the \\"oldest, most complete and genetically intact human skeleton in the New World\\". Genetic testing The original report stated that \\"HN5/48 is among the small group of Paleoamerican skeletons, a group that is morphologically distinct from Native Americans.\\" Genetic testing indicated a genetic link between Paleoamericans and modern indigenous peoples of the Americas as testing found MtDNA haplotype D1. Haplogroup D (mtDNA) is believed to have arisen in Asia. D1 is also found in Central Asia and is one of the founding lineages in the Americas. Subhaplogroup D1 occurs in 10.5% of extant Native Americans, with highest frequency of 29% in indigenous people from Chile and Argentina. The report concluded that \\"HN5/48 shows that the distinctive craniofacial morphology and generalized dentition of Paleoamericans can co-occur with a Beringian derived mtDNA haplogroup. This 13‚Äì12 ka Paleoamerican skeleton thus suggests that Paleoamericans represent an early population expansion out of Beringia, not an earlier migration from elsewhere in Eurasia. This is consistent with hypotheses that both Paleoamericans and Native Americans derive from a single source population, whether or not all share a lineal relationship ... the differences in craniofacial form between Native Americans and their Paleoamerican predecessors are best explained as evolutionary changes that postdate the divergence of Beringians from their Siberian ancestors.\\" Impact on the American skull morphology debate A report published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology in January 2015 looked again at craniofacial variation focusing on differences between early and late Native Americans and explanations for these based on either skull morphology or molecular genetics. Arguments based on molecular genetics have in the main, according to the authors, accepted a single migration from Asia with a probable pause in Berengia, plus later bi-directional gene flow. Studies focusing on craniofacial morphology have argued that Paleoamerican remains have \\"been described as much closer to African and Australo-Melanesians populations than to the modern series of Native Americans\\", suggesting two entries into the Americas, an early one occurring before a distinctive East Asian morphology developed (referred to in the paper as the \\"Two Components Model\\"). A third model, the \\"Recurrent Gene Flow\\" [RGF] model, attempts to reconcile the two, arguing that circumarctic gene flow after the initial migration could account for morphological changes. Noting that the original report on the Hoyo Negro skeleton supported the RGF model, the authors disagreed with the conclusion suggesting that the skull shape did not match those of modern Native Americans, arguing that the \\"skull falls into a subregion of the morphospace occupied by both Paleoamericans and some modern Native Americans.\\" See also *Chan Hol *Eve of Naharon *Kennewick Man *Settlement of the Americas Notes References Category:Archaic period in the Americas Category:Human remains (archaeological) Category:Sistema Sac Actun and Sistema Dos Ojos Category:Paleo-Indian period Category:Paleo-Indian archaeological sites in Mexico Category:Oldest human remains in the Americas ","title":"Naia (skeleton)"},{"id":"42774951","text":"Hilchen Sommerschild Hilchen Sommerschild (1756 - 6 November 1831), was a Norwegian teacher.

Her education is unknown. In 1799, she was employed as a teacher for the female students at the first Realschule in Norway: Trondhjems borgerlige Realskole. It had been opened in 1783 and was intended to teach both genders, but it had been regarded unsuitable for females to be educated there until the employment of a female teacher. Her subjects were music, singing and languages: she was also expected to tend to household tasks, and order in school and to always be present to supervise the female students whether in class or on the breaks. She was described as competent. She was given a salary of 150 riksdaler in comparison to her male colleagues, who were given 300. In 1803 she was given a maid as an assistant. The school was seen as a model school for the following public schools which were founded after it, as was her position there until the 1860s.

He is best known for his founding of Falcon Cable, which he sold in 1999 for $3.7 billion. He is a member of the Cable TV Hall of Fame, awarded with Inc.s Entrepreneur of the Year and a former chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Early life Nathanson was born in Los Angeles and raised in Illinois. Nathanson graduated from Highland Park High School and in 1967 from the University of Denver. He also earned an MA from the University of California Santa Barbara. Career In 1969, he took a job with Cypress Communications Corporation (owned by Harriscope Broadcasting) in Los Angeles, California, where he became head of marketing (Cypress was eventually sold to Warner Cable in 1973). After Cypress Communications, Nathanson became vice-president of marketing and programming for TelePrompTer Corporation. In 1973, he left to start his own firm, Falcon Cable, with a self-investment of $25,000. He received a $2 million investment from his father and father-in-law, and $6 million from a bank loan. The first cable systems he ran were in Gilroy, Porterville. Altadena, and San Luis Obispo, California. The umbrella corporation for the cable company and Nathanson's other ventures was Falcon Holding Group, which Nathanson served as president for until 1999. The corporation included Falcon International Communications and Falcon International. He also served as the company's CEO from 1975 until its sale in 1999. From 1988 to 1999 he also served as chief executive officer and president of Enstar Communications Corp, and as chairman of the board for each of the companiesl. According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"while many larger cable TV companies have scrambled to wire major metropolitan areas with flashy, 75-channel, state-of-the-art cable TV systems, Falcon has found success in operating no-frills systems in areas that get poor TV reception.\\" The Falcon Group formed in 1984 with Nathanson co- owner of the cable company. According to the Los Angeles Times, the company was formed with other co-owners, including the Mutual Life Insurance of New York, following a $50 million deal for 18 cable systems in seven states that were owned jointly by Warner Communications and American Express. Nathanson was a part of larger mergers between cable entities during the 1990s as well. In 1998 Tele-Communications Inc. took a 47 percent stake in Falcon, and the following year the company was sold to Paul Allen's Charter Communications for $3.7 (initial reports pegged the price closer to $3.6 billion). The deal provided Nathanson with the second largest stock holding among the Charter shareholders. According to the St. Louis Business Journal, the deal made \\"Charter the fourth-largest cable TV operator in the country, with 5.5 million customers.\\" In 1994, he was Inc. Magazine's Entrepreneur of the Year. President Bill Clinton appointed Nathanson to a three-year term on the Board of Governors of International Broadcasting of the United States Information Agency in 1998. He served as chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors during the Clinton and Bush administrations, is a member of the American Democracy Institute, the U.S. Institute of Peace's International Advisory Council, and the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. His tenure as chairman of the Broadcasting Board of Governors lasted from 1995 to 2002 and included leading the Broadcasting Board of Governors through its international response to the September 11 attacks. Nathanson invested the profits from the sale into his investment firms Mapleton Investments and Mapleton/RDS Real Estate Group, which has investments in industries ranging from radio to real estate to waterless urinal companies with Falcon Waterfree Technologies, which he first invested with in 2000. He is currently Chairman of each firm. Falcon Waterfree Technologies is the largest manufacturer of waterless urinals in the world. Nathanson became vice-chairman of Charter Communications upon the sale of Falcon and a director of the board, until 2008. He also served as director of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association and a trustee of the Aspen Institute. He had also previously served as president of the California Cable Television Association, as a member of Cable Pioneers, and founded both the Cable Television Administration and Marketing Society (CTAM) and the Southern California Cable Television Association.

She is best known for her contralto or low voice range singing in the film songs, \\"Ankhiyan Milake Jiyaa Bharmaake\\" and \\"Aai Diwali, Aai Diwali\\" in 1944 hit Rattan (1944), with music by Naushad, and \\"Uran Khatole Pe Ud Jaoon\\", duet with Shamshad Begum in Anmol Ghadi (1946), also under Naushad's music direction. She, along with Rajkumari, Shamshad Begum and Amirbai Karnataki, were amongst the leading first generation of playback singers in the Hindi film industry. However, by the late 1940s, the arrival of new voices like Geeta Dutt and Lata Mangeshkar, meant Zohrabai Ambalewali's career faded away. Early life and background Born and brought up in Ambala in present-day Haryana, to family of professional singers, which lend to her surname, 'Ambalewali', started her musical training under Ghulam Hussain Khan and Ustad Nasir Hussain Khan. Subsequently, she was trained in music by the Agra gharana of Hindustani music. Career Ambalewali started her career at age 13, as a singer with the All India Radio, singing mainly classical and semi-classical numbers. This led to recording a few albums of thumris with HMV music label. Eventually she made her Hindi film debut as a playback singer with film Daku Ki Ladki (1933) with music by Pransukh Nayak. After initial years in Lahore-based film industry, she shifted to Bombay (now Mumbai). Her musical success came with film Rattan (1944) under music director Naushad Ali, and such hit songs as \\"Aai Diwali Aai Diwali\\" and \\"Akhiyan Mila Ke, Jiya Bharma Ke\\". She sang for music director Naushad, again in hit films like Anmol Ghadi (1946), Mela (1948), and Jadoo (1951). Profile of Zohrabai Ambalewali on cineplot.com website She also sang a qawwali with Noor Jehan and Kalyani \\"Aahen Na Bhareen Shikway Na Kiye\\" in Zeenat (1945), which was the first ever Qawwali recorded in female voices in South Asian films and became very popular among the public. This was the era when heavy thumri-style and the leading playback singers with nasal voices were singing in the Hindi cinema, with singers like Shamshad Begum, Khurshid, Amirbai Karnataki. This was right before the arrival of Lata Mangeshkar in 1948, which along with Geeta Dutt and Asha Bhosle shifted the popular taste towards finer voices, effectively bringing their careers to a gradual end. Another major film playback singer of that era Noor Jehan decided to migrate to Pakistan and had a highly successful singing career in Pakistan until she died in 2000. Zohrabai Ambalewali retired in the 1950s from the film industry, though she continued to sing at the performances of her daughter Roshan Kumari, a noted Kathak dancer, who also performed in Satyajit Ray's film Jalsaghar (1958).

Life The brother of James Thomas Gooderham Rodwell (died 1825), playwright and lessee of London's Adelphi Theatre, was born in London, 15 November 1800. A pupil of Vincent Novello and Henry Rowley Bishop, he became in 1828 professor of harmony and composition at the Royal Academy of Music. On the death of his brother James in 1825, Rodwell succeeded to the proprietorship of the Adelphi Theatre; but Frederick Henry Yates with Daniel Terry bought him out very shortly, at a price of ¬£30,000. Rodwell then mainly occupied himself with directing the music at the theatre, and in composition for the stage. His opera The Flying Dutchman was produced at the Adelphi in 1826, and The Cornish Miners at the English Opera House in 1827. In 1836 Rodwell was appointed director of music at Covent Garden Theatre, where his farce Teddy the Tiler, from the French Pierre ou le Couvreur (Nicolas Brazier and Pierre-Fr√©d√©ric-Adolphe Carmouche), had been performed in 1830. The Covent Garden management tried to anticipate the repertory of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; and Rodwell, though friendly with Alfred Bunn, the Drury Lane manager, sailed close to the wind in this regard. When Daniel Auber's opera The Bronze Horse, was announced at Drury Lane, he brought out at Covent Garden an opera on the same theme, with music by himself. Rodwell's efforts to establish a British national opera, launched through the Royal Society of Musicians, had no lasting result. For many years he lived at Brompton. He died, aged 52, at Upper Ebury Street, Pimlico, on 22 January 1852, and was buried in Brompton cemetery. Works Rodwell wrote 40 to 50 musical pieces for the stage, besides songs, works on musical theory, romances, farces, and novels. Exponents of his ballads included Mary Anne Keeley, Harriet Waylett, and Mary Ann Paton. In some cases Rodwell wrote the words as well as the music for his stage pieces. His principal librettist was Edward Fitzball; but John Baldwin Buckstone, James Kenney, and Richard Brinsley Peake also supplied him with romances, burlettas, operettas, and incidental songs, for musical setting. Among his publications were: * Songs of the Birds, 1827. * First Rudiments of Harmony, 1831. * Letter to the Musicians of Great Britain, 1833. * Memoirs of an Umbrella, a novel, 1846. Family Rodwell's marriage with Emma Liston, the daughter of John Liston the comedian, may have helped him professionally, but was thought unhappy. Elizabeth Ann, their youngest daughter, married the illustrator Robert Thomas Landells, son of Ebenezer Landells.

(Individual municipal jurisdictions issue lesser awards to law enforcement officers and the state has three statutory civilian decorations: the Washington Medal of Merit, Washington Medal of Valor and the Washington Gift of Life Award). Washington law does not describe an order of precedence for state decorations and the Washington Law Enforcement Medal of Honor is not customarily placed in relation to other state decorations. Medal =Qualifications= All law enforcement officers in the state of Washington (including both those commissioned under the authority of state of Washington, as well as those of the United States), living or dead, who have been seriously injured or killed while in the performance of duty, or who have been distinguished by exceptionally meritorious conduct, are eligible to receive the medal from the Governor of Washington. In issuing the medal, the Governor acts on the recommendation of the \\"law enforcement medal of honor committee,\\" which consists of the Attorney-General of Washington, a representative of the Governor, and delegates from four police associations. While any person is eligible to nominate a law enforcement officer for the Washington Law Enforcement Medal of Honor, all nominations must be seconded by a sheriff or chief of police of the state of Washington before being submitted to the committee for consideration. =Design and presentation= The Washington Law Enforcement Medal of Honor is bronze. It depicts the Seal of Washington centered on the obverse side surrounded by the words \\"Law Enforcement Medal of Honor.\\" The reverse of the decoration is inscribed with the words \\"for exceptionally honorable and meritorious conduct in performing services as a law enforcement officer.\\" By custom, the medal is annually awarded by the Governor to a slate of recipients during the first week of May in a ceremony held at the Peace Officers Memorial in Olympia, Washington. The medal is worn as a neck decoration, and is the only non-military neck award issued by Washington. Background The Washington Law Enforcement Medal of Honor was established in 1994 by an act of the Washington Legislature. As of 2014, Seattle police officer David Sires, who was shot to death while pursuing suspect Benjamin Payne in October 1881, is the longest deceased officer to have received the Law Enforcement Medal of Honor, which was posthumously awarded in 1998 (Sires' last living relative having died in 1939, the medal was accepted on his behalf by a representative from the Seattle police department).

It is formed by casting the monomer, methyl methacrylate, mixed with initiators and possibly other additives into a form or mold. Sheet and rod stock are generated by casting into static forms, while tubing is done in rotational molds.  Advantages  It has better thermal stability, higher resistance to crazing (when a network of very small cracks form) when exposed to solvents, wider thermoforming range than extruded acrylic. Cast acrylic has a better ability to be reworked hot and it is known for its superior surface finish and optical properties. Also cast acrylic is more scratch resistant than extruded acrylic. Cast acrylic is also preferred over extruded in applications that require machinings, such as turning on Engine Lathe or milling/drilling. Extruded acrylic, with far less thermal stability, tends to melt and clog cutting tools. Even with slow speeds and lots of coolants, extruded acrylic does not produce the surface finish and tight tolerances achievable with cast acrylic.  Properties  Advantages of Acrylic: Excellent optical clarity & transparency Highly resistant to variations in temperature Up to 17 times the impact resistance of ordinary glass Half the weight of glass and ideal for precision machining Highly resistant to many different chemicals Acrylic (PMMA*) has certain properties making it an ideal material for use in a wide range of applications, including medical, life sciences and food/beverage testing. *PMMA ‚Äì PolyMethyl MethAcrylate.

Foundation & Club culture Many Lech Pozna≈Ñ supporters felt that heavy handed policing, frequent games behind closed doors, and the rising pressure on supporter groups and amount of responsibility pinned on them, and restrictions regarding tifos and pyrotechnics has made supporting Lech, one of the country's top teams less enjoyable. In order to reclaim some of the spontaneity and be able to participate in the ultras scene more freely a \\"fans football club, for the fans, by the fans\\" was set up in 2011, however unlike many other supporter owned clubs (e.g.: F.C.

Woudstra.\\" Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale, 2001. Biography in Context. Web. 21 May 2014. was a Dutch-born evangelical theologian, biblical scholar, seminary professor, and minister of the Christian Reformed Church. He served as president of the Evangelical Theological Society and as chairman of the Old Testament committee for the translation of the New International Version of the Bible. Woudstra's most notable contribution to evangelical scholarship is the publication of his commentary on the Book of Joshua in the New International Commentary on the Old Testament. Early life and education Woudstra was born July 23, 1922, in a Catholic family in Burgum, the Netherlands (then officially called Bergum). After graduating from a Reformed Gymnasium, he attended the Reformed Theological Seminary in Kampen from 1942 to 1946. He emigrated to the United States, earned his B.D. (1948) and then Th.M. (1949) from Westminster Theological Seminary outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Woudstra then studied at the Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning (1951‚Äì52), and, after his ordination discussed below, at the Free University of Amsterdam (1955). While studying at the Westminster Theological Seminary, Woudstra also taught at the Reformed Episcopal Seminary which at that time was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1961, Woudstra became the first person to receive a Doctor of Theology degree from the Westminster Theological Seminary. He later studied at the University of Hamburg (1969‚Äì70). Career In 1953, the Christian Reformed Church ordained Woudstra as a minister. He served as pastor of the Third Christian Reformed Church in Edmonton, Alberta for two years. During this time, Woudstra also edited The Presbyterian Guardian, a journal published by the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. From 1955 until his retirement in 1985, Woudstra served as professor of Hebrew and Old Testament exegesis at Calvin Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1957, Woudstra, along with Henry Schultze, Ralph Stob, and Martin Wyngaarden, formed a committee to consider producing a \\"faithful translation of the Scriptures in the common language of the American people.\\" In 1962, this committee joined representatives from National Association of Evangelicals to constitute the \\"Joint Committee on Bible Translation\\", of which Woudstra was named chairperson. As the effort gained momentum, Woudstra and Wyngaarden remained key members of what became the Committee on Bible Translation (Schultze and Stob having died before the official launching of the translation effort in 1965). Wyngaarden was replaced by John Stek in 1962, but Woudstra continued to serve as a permanent member of the committee, eventually being appointed chair of the Old Testament committee, until the publication of the complete New International Version of the Bible in 1978. The following year he was elected to serve a term as president of the Evangelical Theological Society. Woudstra died October 3, 1991, in Kentwood, Michigan.
