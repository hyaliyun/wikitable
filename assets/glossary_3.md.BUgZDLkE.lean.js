Morse is an American medical doctor who specialized in pediatrics. He was voted by his peers as one of \\"America's Best Doctors\\" in 1997‚Äì1998, 2001‚Äì2002, and 2005‚Äì2006. He has published numerous scientific articles in medical journals over the course of his thirty-year career. As the author of several books, Morse has appeared on many talk show and television programs to discuss his extensive research on near-death experiences in children. His 1991 book Closer to the Light was a bestseller. Oprah Winfrey interviewed Morse about this book in 1992. Larry King interviewed Morse in 2010. The PBS show Upon Reflection produced a half-hour episode devoted to Morse. He was the subject of an article in the Rolling Stone magazine in 2004 entitled \\"In search of the Dead Zone\\". In 2012, Morse and his second wife were charged with felony child endangerment based on allegations made by his eleven-year-old step-daughter, Anna Morse. During Morse's 2014 trial, he was dubbed as the \\"waterboarding doctor\\" by the media. Trial testimony did not substantiate any instances of \\"waterboarding\\" as the term is generally understood; however, Morse was convicted of reckless endangerment and was sentenced to serve three years in prison. Morse was released from Sussex County Correctional Institution (SSCI) in 2016. According to Kahlil Peterkin, Clinical Supervisor of the prison's therapeutic Key program and Morse's therapist of thirteen months, Morse underwent a transformation while incarcerated. Peterkin also reported Morse was well-respected by his fellow inmates and considered a leader in prison. He taught fellow inmates meditation techniques which Peterkin also described as 'transformative\\" in the lives of the men who learned and practiced them. Following his release, Morse co-founded The Recidivism Prevention Group, a company dedicated to assisting addicts and former inmates in developing spiritual understandings to re-enter society as productive members. The group uses meditation techniques to accomplish these goals. Morse now resides in Washington, DC. Early life and education Morse graduated from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Science. Morse earned a medical degree from George Washington University in Washington, D.C. in 1980. He interned in Pediatrics at the University of California at San Francisco, and then completed a residency in Pediatrics at Seattle Children's Hospital. He subsequently completed a two-year fellowship in Hematology/Oncology and a one- year fellowship in Behavioral Pediatrics.Melvin Morse, M.D. Career Morse practiced Pediatrics in Renton, Washington for 20 years. He was an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Washington in Seattle. In 1986, Morse worked for a year as a pediatrician at Fort Hall, Idaho for the Indian Health Service. He retired from the full-time practice of Pediatrics in 2006 before moving to Delaware in 2007. Prior to his arrest, he was working as a pediatrician at an office in Milton, Delaware. After his arrest on child endangerment charges in 2012, his Delaware license was suspended. In 2007, Morse became the Research Director of the Institute for the Scientific Study of Consciousness (ISSC) founded by Charles Tart in 1979. While Director of ISSC, he was awarded the Warcollier International Prize for consciousness research in 2011. =Publications=   * * Personal life Morse has been married twice, and has six children, five of whom are adopted. He is in regular contact all his children. Delaware Family Court has not restricted his access to his daughter Melody. = Reckless Endangerment Conviction = In August 2012, Morse and his wife Pauline were arrested for felony child endangerment based on allegations of \\"waterboarding\\" made by his eleven-year- old step-daughter, Anna. He was also accused by Delaware State Police of force-feeding the eleven-year-old girl until she threw up, among other child abuses. Morse's trial started on January 28, 2014 at the Sussex County Superior Court in Delaware. The accusation made by the State Police that Morse had force-fed his step-daughter was not substantiated at trial. The step- daughter testified at trial that she vomited due to overeating, not force feeding. Morse placed her in the bathtub and ran water over her head to rinse the vomit out of her hair. This was the testimony which spawned the term \\"waterboarding\\" by the prosecution and the media. The trial transcripts contain no testimony regarding any instances of \\"waterboarding\\" in the context of torture as it is known today. Morse was convicted of one felony count of first-degree reckless endangerment (for holding his step-daughter's head under the faucet of a bathtub) and five misdemeanor charges. He was sentenced to a five-year sentence, with three years to be served in prison and two on probation. His wife pled guilty to misdemeanor charges. Anna confirmed that the occasion of \\"washing vomit out of her hair\\" was not the only occasion of \\"waterboarding\\". That name that he had given the act. The eleven year old step daughter stated that on at least four more memorable occasions, he had held her face under a kitchen sink faucet with the shower mode turned on. He allegedly held her arms down to avoid getting scratched as she struggled. But her lawyer refused to bring this into the trial because it was unreliable.

It is a small, dark colored frog that is threatened or endangered in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Studies have been done to see why the population of the frog is beginning to decrease in those states. Blanchard's cricket frogs are commonly found in wetlands, ponds, and/or near row crop agriculture. The average life span for this frog is about one year, which is why the species is considered to be short-lived. Little is known about the interactions and basic ecology, even though populations are decreasing. Blanchard's cricket frog was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the northern cricket frog. Description Blanchard's cricket frogs have warty skin that is usually brown, gray, tan, or olive green, with darker bands of color on the legs. Their skin is also heavily vascularized, which may allow substances to get into their bodies quickly, increasing their susceptibility to diseases. A dark, triangular mark between the eyes is frequently seen. They are small, growing to in length. They generally inhabit slow-moving or stagnant bodies of water, and are the most aquatic of tree frogs in North America. They hibernate during the cold months, beginning in late October, and emerging from hibernation in late March or early April. Breeding occurs from mid-May to mid-July. Females lay small clusters or single eggs. Tadpoles emerge in late summer. Breeding males have a metallic clicking call distinctive to the species. The subspecies is named after Frank N. Blanchard, a noted American herpetologist. The frogs are most commonly found in streams and wetlands where reproduction takes place. Only a few survive until the second breeding season. If a breeding season isn't productive, the population for that area can decline. Conservation Blanchard's cricket frogs can be found through most of the Midwest United States, ranging from Michigan and Wisconsin in the north to southern Texas in the south and from Colorado in the west to West Virginia in the east. Although not listed at the federal level, Blanchard's cricket frogs are considered at risk in some states. It is an endangered species in Wisconsin, and is a threatened species in Michigan, due to a significant population decline since the late 1970s. Habitat loss, chemical contaminants, and competition for resources have been posited as reasons for this decline. Populations can still be found in the southern and western portions of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. A. crepitans, including A. c. blanchardi, is also considered endangered in Minnesota. It may also still be on Pelee Island, Ontario, Canada, but has not been reported since 1987.Acris blanchardi Blanchard's Cricket Frog / Rainette Grillon de Blanchard, CARCNET It was thought that competition by Bullfrogs caused a decrease in the population of Blanchard's cricket frog, however, a study found no evidence that Bullfrog tadpoles took enough resources from Blanchard's cricket frog tadpoles to impact them. Another study of the immune defense traits of Blanchard's cricket frog showed that multiple factors can influence the immune system of the frog, for example water conductivity, water surface area, and ratio of natural to managed land. All of these factors were found to influence the skin microbiome of the frog, and compromise the frog's immune system. While some decreases in population are due to chemical contaminants and competition for resources, the major reason for the decrease is still unknown.

In 1928, the three brothers, Karl (1908‚Äì1997), Jack (1911‚Äì1959), and Dan (1896‚Äì1961) Landt, with their accompanist Howard White, were signed onto the NBC Blue Network as sustaining artists and began a career of more than 20 years. They performed primarily on radio but also performed in vaudeville, including some headline runs at the Palace and Carnegie Hall, and made many personal appearances. They were unusual in the music world in that they did not read music, so they sang and played by ear. They continued to perform on radio and in advertising until the early 1950s, when the rising popularity of television ended their performance career. Early years and family Karl Benson, John \\"Jack\\" Matthias, and Daniel \\"Dan\\" Beckwith were three of the five children of Matthias Cole Landt, a foreman in the Lackawanna Woolen Mills in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Hulda Teresa Amena Benson Landt, who had immigrated to the United States from Sweden with her parents at the age of two. There were also two daughters, Edith and Mildred. They were a musical family. Matt sang and played guitar, Hulda was a contralto. The parents sang with and to their children, and the children learned to sing and harmonize together. Karl was said to be able to sing harmony before he could talk and became a boy soloist in the Lutheran Church choir. Matt was enamored of Thomas Edison's new phonographic technology and used wax cylinders to record his children singing. After leaving his job at the woolen mill, he sold Edison phonographs and was known as \\"the Edison man,\\" until radio displaced phonographs in most homes. After Karl taught himself to play the ukulele, he and Jack began singing together, as young teens, for friends and family and eventually on local Scranton radio stations, WGBI and WQAM, calling themselves the Landt Brothers. Older brother, Dan, had joined the U.S. Army at the age of 16 and served in the Pancho Villa Expedition under General \\"Blackjack\\" Pershing, and then in Germany in World War I. While in Europe, he sang in a quartet with Eddie McManus. After the war, Dan returned to Scranton looking for work. He found the family in difficult financial circumstances, since his father had been reduced to selling cookware door-to-door, sister Mildred was working for a pittance as a secretary at the A&P;, 20-year-old Karl was out of work, and Jack was still in school at age 16. Dan joined his younger brothers in their singing act, and introduced them to a friend, Howard White, who owned and ran a bakery. White had learned to play piano from a self-taught black pianist who \\"only played on the black keys.\\" Known as Howard \\"Velvet Fingers\\" White, Howard could play only by ear and was the perfect match for the trio, who sang only by ear. Meanwhile, Eddie McManus, who was a friend of Howard as well as Dan, had become a vaudeville performer and encouraged the group to take their act to New York. Because they had no money, Karl borrowed $300 from his Sunday School teacher, and they set off to try to \\"make it\\" in vaudeville. Early career The Landt Trio & White in 1929During their first few weeks of auditioning and singing at parties in New York, the group found themselves receiving a great deal of encouragement, but no firm job offers. A large part of their appeal seemed to be their youthful, small-town innocence, and the way their pleasing harmonies blended with the velvety sound of White's piano. After five weeks, an NBC talent scout overheard them, and sent them to audition with Tim Sullivan of NBC Artists' Services. Calling themselves \\"The Landt Trio and White,\\" they were signed to a contract as sustaining artists for the NBC blue network. Howard White's friend Kenny Raught, who had worked in Howard's Bake Shop in Scranton, had a talent for words and a great sense of humor. He joined the group in New York and became their writer. He later married their sister Mildred. The trio moved their parents and sister to New York, and soon older sister Edith and her husband followed to be near them. The family remained very close, living either in the same house or within a few blocks of each other throughout most of their career. The family's closeness was reflected in the style of their performance, which was always family-friendly and had a certain wholesomeness that was appealing to much of their audience. As sustaining artists, the Landt Trio and White appeared on many variety programs on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), which had been formed in 1926. When the network expanded its programming to earlier morning hours, in November 1928, the trio was tapped for their own first series, \\"On the 8:15\\". This program skyrocketed in popularity as a cheerful way to prepare workers for their morning commute. Its format, performing a mix of popular standards and novelty tunes with humorous repartee, became a pattern for many of their later shows. The Landt Trio & White about 1936.They became one of the busiest acts on radio at this time, with programs or appearances throughout the broadcast day. Some of their sponsors were Mobiloil, Eveready, Erector Toys, Gilbert Toys, Breyers Ice Cream, Spang Baking Co., Dill's Best with Pick and Pat, Omega Oil, Ford, D&H; Coal, and Lucky Strike. In addition, they performed in vaudeville houses, including the Palace, the Roxy, and the RKO Hippodrome. They did numerous personal appearances, including performing at high society parties and visiting wounded veterans in the hospital. They performed with B. A. Rolfe and His Lucky Strike Orchestra, Nathaniel Shilkret and the Victor Orchestra on The Eveready Hour, and with Vincent Lopez. Their career was going full force between 1930 and 1936, with many daytime and prime-time broadcasts, until January 1937 when Howard White died suddenly of a heart attack. Later career Howard White's demise was personally painful but also a near catastrophe professionally for the Landt Trio. Karl was the only one who had learned to read any music, and all their arrangements had been written in a shorthand they developed for their own use. They tried out several pianists, including Vi Mealy, and other musical accompaniments. Through this transition, they were rapidly losing sponsored programming, and within a year they had no radio work in New York. However, in the mid-30s, the Landt Trio had begun to do advertising work for George Nelson of the Leighton and Nelson Advertising Agency. Nelson offered them work on radio in Schenectady, New York and the opportunity to barnstorm in the area. They saw this offer as a chance to rebuild their act and their reputation. They had begun to work with a young, talented accompanist and arranger, Curley Mahr, so the four of them agreed to move to Schenectady. In the fall of 1938, the Landt Trio began performing on WGY, and performed under the name The Landt Trio and Mahr. They spent the next two years working in Schenectady where they learned both new material and new arrangements of songs they had performed with Howard White. Two of their shows during this period were \\"Vest Pocket Varieties\\" and \\"Morning Matinee.\\" They also did commercial work for Mohawk Carpets, Pepsi Cola, Sealtest, and Camel cigarettes. They participated briefly in experimental programming being done there in the new medium of television. They never developed a strong fan base in Schenectady, however, and in early 1940 they returned to New York where they supported themselves through their publishing company, Coast to Coast Music, and by singing jingles. In 1940, President Roosevelt instituted a one-year peacetime draft. Early in 1941, the Coast to Coast Music Corporation published a song by Mack Kay, \\"Goodbye Dear, I'll Be Back In A Year,\\" (\\"cause I'm in the Army now\\"). The song rapidly rose on the charts, its popularity enhanced by a \\"soundie,\\" a film short featuring the Landt Trio. However, in August 1941, the draft was extended, causing a widespread protest among the twelve-month draftees. Floods of sheet music were returned, and the soundie became a sad reminder of more optimistic days. In October 1941, the Columbia Broadcasting System hired the Landt Trio for a five-day-a-week program, \\"Sing Along with the Landt Trio\\". They received a great deal of fan mail welcoming them back to the air after their hiatus, and their career began to rise again. \\"Sing Along\\" was extended from a fifteen-minute to a half-hour program with a studio audience. To fill the extra time, they instituted games such as \\"Name That Tune,\\" and \\"Sing For Silver,\\" which served as ideas for later television game shows. They continued to do a mix of standards and novelty songs with light comedic banter. Perhaps the most enduring song they introduced was \\"Mairzy Doats.\\" On October 28, 1946, they performed a \\"Sing Along with the Landt Trio\\" program at Carnegie Hall. When Mitch Miller developed his television program \\"Sing Along With Mitch\\" in 1958, he based it on \\"Sing Along with the Landt Trio.\\" During the \\"Sing Along\\" period, the trio worked with several \\"girl singers\\" including Julie Conway who was the wife of NBC staff announcer, Robert Sherry, and Carol Ames. Their announcers included Bill Cullen (who later married Ames) and Sandy Becker. They had several other series that ran for shorter periods during this time. Curley Mahr and, later, Johnny Cole were their accompanists during most of this period. \\"Sing Along with the Landt Trio\\" continued until 1948, when Dan had a heart attack. He was able to come back to work and the trio continued, but it became harder and harder for them to work as television became the preeminent medium. In 1951, Jack had a serious automobile accident that kept him from performing for over six months. That effectively ended the Landt Trio's singing career. When he was able to work again, Jack went on to own and operate a business on Long Island. Dan worked successfully in real estate in Westchester County, New York and became a town assessor. Karl wrote and performed jingles for several years and then developed a new career as a life insurance underwriter.

Schulte entered the international stage at 15 years old when he won a silver medal at the 2011 Pacific Games held in New Caledonia. At the 2014 Micronesian Games, Schulte was awarded medals in all 11 of his events, nine of them gold, earning him the nickname 'Micro Phelps'. At the 2015 Pacific Games, he won gold in the 200m and 400m medley, silver in the 100m breaststroke, setting a Games record in the heats that was later broken by the gold medalist in the final, and bronze in the 200m breaststroke. At the 2016 Oceania Swimming Championships, Schulte earned a gold and a silver medal. He competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the Men's 10 kilometer Open Water event at only 16 years old. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, he competed for Guam in the 100 meter breaststroke, placing 43rd in the preliminary heats which did not qualify him for the semifinals. He was the flag bearer for Guam during the Parade of Nations.  Early life and education  Benjamin Schulte was born in the Guamanian city of Tamuning on December 22, 1995. He studied business at Bryant University. Schulte was taught to swim at the age of five. His family moved to Australia when he was 14 so he could better pursue his Olympic career. He attended Miami State High School in Queensland's Gold Coast.  Olympic career  Schulte competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London at the age of 16. He discovered he had a chance to qualify for the Olympics in 2011, so he competed in a qualifying event. He failed to qualify, but a New Zealand swimmer declined a spot that was reserved for an Oceania swimmer, which he learned a month prior to the Olympics. He practiced by swimming for ten times per week, going to the gym, and taking yoga classes. He finished the 10 km race with a time of 2:03:35, 14 minutes behind the winner. He was determined to finish, saying, \\"My goal was just to finish. Just being here, being given the opportunity to be here. I didn't want to let down my friends and family back home by not finishing.\\" For his determination, Schulte was nominated for the Open Water Swimming Association's Swimming Man of the Year award in 2012, to which he was runner-up. Following the 2012 Summer Olympics, Schulte decided to refocus and switch from long distance swimming to short distance. He said, \\"I like the competition, but I don't like the training.\\" Schulte competed in the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Guamanian National Olympic Committee (NOC) president Ricardo Blas told Schulte, \\"You deserve the opportunity and right to carry the flag and lead Guam into the Olympic Games\\". Schulte broke his own national record during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, finishing the 100 meter breaststroke with a time of 1:03.29. He plans to compete in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo in the men's 100 meter breaststroke.  International career  Schulte started his international career with the 2011 Pacific Games, where he earned a silver medal in the men's 1500 meter freestyle. Schulte also competed in the 400 meter freestyle; 50 and 100 meter breaststroke; 400 meter individual medley; 400 meter freestyle relay; and 400 meter medley relay. Schulte set the Pacific Games and a Guamanian national record for the 100 meter breaststroke in the first heat of the 2015 Pacific Games with a time of 1:03.42. In the finals, he finished second and earned a silver medal. The winner of the race, Amini Fonua, broke the Pacific Games record he set six hours prior. He also earned two gold and one bronze medal, winning the most medals for Guam at the Games. During the 2016 Oceania Championships, Schulte swam in the 50 and 100 meter breaststroke. In the 100 meter, he won the preliminary round, but finished second in the finals with a time of 1:03.46, earning a silver medal. For the 50 meter breaststroke, he finished second in the preliminary round; however, he edged out New Zealand swimmer Jacob Garrod with a time of 29.26 seconds to win the gold medal. In the 2014 Micronesian Games, Schulte performed well. He earned a gold medal in 9 out of the 11 events he participated in, and was given the nickname \\"Micro Phelps\\". Schulte earned gold in the 50, 100, and 200 meter breaststroke; 4 √ó 100 freestyle relay; 4 √ó 50 medley relay; 1,500 freestyle; 200 and 400 meter individual medley; and 4 √ó 100 medley relay. He won a silver medal in the 100 meter butterfly and the 100 meter freestyle.

Because its plot notoriously derived from Wells's affair with Amber Reeves and satirised Beatrice and Sidney Webb, it was \\"the literary scandal of its day\\".David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 113. Plot summary The New Machiavelli purports to be written in the first person by its protagonist, Richard \\"Dick\\" Remington, who has a lifelong passion for \\"statecraft\\" and who dreams of recasting the social and political form of the English nation. Remington is a brilliant student at Cambridge, writes several books on political themes, marries a wealthy heiress and enters parliament as a Liberal influenced by the socialism of a couple easily recognisable as the Webbs, only to go over to the Conservatives. Remington undertakes the editing of an influential political weekly and is returned to parliament on a platform advocating the state endowment of mothers but his career is wrecked by his love affair with a brilliant young Oxford graduate, Isabel Rivers. When rumours of their affair begin to circulate, Remington tries to break it off but then resolves to abandon wife, career, party and country to live in Italy, where he writes the apologia pro vita sua that the novel constitutes. Themes The novel's themes are politics and sex, both abiding preoccupations of the author. Biographer David Smith called The New Machiavelli \\"Wells's most autobiographical novel\\".David C. Smith, H. G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 112. The development of political and sexual passion in the protagonist is traced in intricate detail. The artificiality of Victorian and Edwardian morality is the novel's chief target, \\"Thank God! I'll soon be out of it! The shame of it! The very savages in Australia initiate their children better than the English do to-day. Neither of us was ever given a view of what they call morality that didn't make it show as shabby subservience, as the meanest discretion, an abject submission to unreasonable prohibitions! meek surrender of mind and body to the dictation of pedants and old women and fools. We weren't taught‚Äîwe were mumbled at!\\"H. G. Wells, The New Machiavelli Book IV, Ch. III, ¬ß4.  Criticism  Some critics have considered The New Machiavelli \\"the beginning of the retreat of Wells the story-teller. It was the first ominous eruption of those magnificent moments of self-assertion which were to disintegrate the novelist in him\\".Vincent Brome, H. G. Wells: A Biography (Longmans, Green, 1951), p. 113. The novel has had many prestigious admirers, Joseph Conrad called it a \\"master-work\\", Upton Sinclair considered it Wells's masterpiece and D. H. Lawrence called it \\"awfully interesting\\"; another admirer, Henry James, regarded Wells's use of the first person an artistic mistake.Michael Sherborne, H. G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), pp . 211‚Äì12. Reception Beatrice Webb called The New Machiavelli \\"very clever in a malicious way\\" but did not sue, saying that the novel \\"lays bare the tragedy of H.G.'s life‚Äîhis aptitude for 'fine thinking' and even 'good feeling' and yet his total incapacity for decent conduct\\".Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.

In 2002, the painting was acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria, and has become one of the gallery's most popular works.\\"Tweet by @ngv_melbourne\\" (21 April 2012).

Retrieved 11 August 2012. Background Footballer is based on St Kilda's Bill Mohr. Born in the inner-Melbourne working class suburb of Carlton on 22 April 1917, Nolan grew up in bayside St Kilda, Melbourne's main leisure precinct. His childhood was spent playing in and around Luna Park, St Kilda Pier and along nearby beaches, jetties and sea baths; memories of this period played an inspirational role in the imagery of Nolan's early paintings, including the Bathers series which he started in 1942. Nolan also had many sporting interests growing up, in particular swimming, cycling, cricket and Australian rules football. He regularly went on weekend trips to the outer at the St Kilda Cricket Ground to barrack for his team, the St Kilda Football Club. In the mid-1940s, when Nolan was painting boyhood recollections of St Kilda and \\"heroic\\" figures such as bushranger Ned Kelly, he decided to paint Footballer, an \\"emblematic portrait of the sports-warrior\\".Jellie, Dugald (29 March 2012). \\"To live football is to truly belong\\", The Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 11 August 2012. The work was painted in the dining room at Heide, the Templestowe home of art patrons John and Sunday Reed, on 24 August 1946. In his journal, Nolan writes: \\"Finished my painting of a footballer this morning and called Jim [the gardener at Heide] to have a look at it. He said it looked quite real, almost as if you were there, so it at least passed the critical eye of a specialist.\\" Its completion date falls in the middle of Nolan's iconic first series of 27 Ned Kelly works, all but one painted in the Heide dining room. Together with the Kelly series, Footballer has been interpreted as a \\"veiled self-portrait\\"‚Äîboth men, like the artist, stand outside society in a \\"space no longer governed by everyday rules.\\"McAullife, Chris (26 July 2008). \\"The games people display\\", The Age.

The painting was first exhibited at the Melbourne branch of the Contemporary Art Society in 1946, and later shown in retrospective exhibitions throughout the 1960s and 70s with the title Fullback, St Kilda, which led to speculation that the footballer is based on Test cricketer and St Kilda fullback Keith \\"Nugget\\" Miller, of whom Nolan was a great fan. Nolan later revealed in an interview that St Kilda's Bill Mohr is the subject, saying \\"I lived in St Kilda and I went to a lot of matches there and they had a fullback called Billy Mohr and in 1946, after coming out of the army and casting back for memories to paint, I decided to paint him.\\"Pearce, Barry.

Reception At a Vietnamese seminar for addressing the struggles of the Vietnamese animation industry, Korean animators named Tayo the Little Bus as a series that has been \\"dominating\\" the Korean market. These animators also noted that the series is popular in China, Thailand, and Vietnam. Cultural impact Route 9401 bus that received Gani wrap In 2014, the Seoul Metropolitan Government commissioned buses designed as the characters Tayo, Gani, Rogi, and Lani, to run around the Gwanghwamun Square area of the city. This was done as part of an initiative to teach children how to use the bus. The initiative was a massive success, drawing crowds of over 40,000 in a single day. People from all across the country came to see the buses. Although the buses were originally set to run from March 26 until Public Transport Day at the end of April, their popularity led to an extension until Children's Day on May 5. The number of buses was also expanded from the original four to 100. In wake of this success, it was reported that the local governments of other cities in South Korea were considering adopting the campaign. Officials for the city of Seoul initially opposed this on copyright grounds, but they consented in April to letting other cities use the characters for non-commercial purposes. Jaeyeon Woo of The Wall Street Journal's blog Korea Real Time, speculated in an April 2014 article that the success of this initiative led both of Gyeonggi Province's gubernatorial candidates, Kim Sang-gon and Nam Kyung-pil, to adopt public transportation issues as a key part of their campaign platforms. Seoul-mayor Park Won-soon, who began the initiative, has been criticized by some of his political rivals, who feel that he took credit for the series, even though the series was begun by his predecessor's administration. On October 16, 2014, a South Korean group called the Teen Astronauts, launched a space balloon designed as the character Tayo from the Space Science Park in Korea's National Science Museum.

Hero (28 July 1854 ‚Äì 1932) was a New Orleans entrepreneur who organized the drainage of vast tracts of swampland on the West Bank of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. He was known locally as the \\"Drainage King\\". and was founder of the Hero Land Company. Later Hero was involved in a project to build a bridge from New Orleans to the West Bank, but this was never completed. Early life Hero was born in New Orleans. Career As a young man, Hero began working at W.F. Halsey Company, agents for a New York bank. When he was twenty he joined the cotton firm Robinson and Hero, and later owned and operated the business under his own name. In 1889 Lehman, Stern and Company hired him to run its cotton futures department. When the company incorporated in 1896, he became its vice president. Hero retired from the cotton business in 1912. He owned a derelict plantation on the west bank of the Mississippi River. Canals dug there during the early 19th century in order to grow sugar and cotton had degraded after the Civil War, and the swampy land was almost worthless. Hero's neighbors showed no interest in pooling their resources to drain the land, so he purchased 10,000 more acres in order to meet the minimum acreage required to petition the Louisiana legislature to create a drainage authority for the two West Bank parishes (counties). He bore all the early expenses by himself. The Louisiana state government approved the Jefferson-Plaquemines Drainage District, adding to it the West Bank segment of Orleans Parish and appointed Hero president. Mayor Martin Behrman proclaimed the day the pumps were started, February 13, 1915, as ‚ÄúHero Day‚Äù, and the town lauded him with parades and a banquet. President Woodrow Wilson sent his congratulations. In 1925 Hero donated land in Belle Chasse next to the Mississippi River for the first commercial airport to serve New Orleans. Suitable for use by land and sea planes, it was named for World War I hero, Alvin Callender and dedicated on November 6, 1926. Exhibition flying entertained the crowds, including dignitaries and aviators such as Howard Hughes. George A. Hero was given a rousing ovation. In 1928 George Hero and Allen S. Hackett applied for a permit to build a bridge across the Mississippi from Race Street to Gretna. After long negotiations, in 1930 President Herbert Hoover signed a bill approving plans for the War Department to construct a $12,000,000 vehicular toll bridge. The bridge designed by engineer Hackett, was to have separate, but interlaced, up and down spiral ramps to reduce the amount of land needed for the approaches. The Hero-Hackett Bridge design was estimated to save $3,000,000 over bridges with conventional approaches. The center of the span was to be 174‚Äô above the river to allow large ships to pass under. The bridge was to be erected before 1933, but Hero was struck by an automobile in August 1932. He never fully recovered and died from a stroke on December 19, 1932. In the meantime plans to build the Huey P. Long Bridge further up the river had begun and the Hero-Hackett Bridge was abandoned. Hero's papers are preserved in the archives of Louisiana State University. Personal Hero was married three times: first to Fenella Marie Olivier (20 Nov 1859-27 Dec 1893), second to her sister, Anna Olivier (1873- 26 Dec 26,1913) and third to Claire Joubert de Ville Marest Archinard. He had three children by Fenella: Alfred, Numa and Fenella, and three by Anna: George, Alvin and Claire.

Abusharifhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-2007-03-24-0703240120-story.html (born September 14, 1980) is an American woman, convicted of the 2007 Villa Park, Illinois murder of her domestic partner, Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Klein. After being found guilty of first-degree murder in May 2009, Abusharif was sentenced to 50 years in prison at the Dwight Correctional Center in Nevada Township, Illinois. The case made national news because of the intrigue of a \\"lesbian love triangle\\" murder. Murder and investigation On March 17, 2007, the body of Klein was discovered in the trunk of her 1966 Ford Mustang, after Klein's domestic partner of seven years, Abusharif, reported her missing. Klein was found bound with duct tape, gagged with a bandana, blindfolded, and suffocated with a plastic bag over her head. Four days later, Abusharif was charged with first- degree murder and concealing of a homicide. Villa Park police officers believe that Abusharif killed Klein on March 15, 2007, two days before her body was found. After Abusharif allegedly suffocated Klein to death, she went out with another woman, the 19-year-old Rose Sodaro, she met on the social networking site MySpace. That night, Abusharif and Sodaro went bowling in Tinley Park and returned to Abusharif's home, where they engaged in sex. Sodaro believed that Klein was Abusharif's roommate, not her life partner. In addition to her relationship with Sodaro, police also believe that Abusharif was motivated to kill Klein by a $400,000 insurance payout. Forensic scientists found fingerprints on the duct tape and plastic bag belonging to Abusharif and her DNA on the bandana. Prosecutors also uncovered a slew of lies that Abusharif allegedly told, including stating to Sodaro that she had been a New York City firefighter during the September 11, 2001 attacks. Abusharif, who was also an alcoholic, claimed to have liver cancer and told Sodaro that her alcoholism would lead to her death. Abusharif also brought Sodaro to a funeral home, where she dramatically selected her own casket. During the police's investigation into the murder of Klein, Abusharif's coworker at a Des Plaines security company, Robert L. Edwards, was charged with five counts of obstructing justice for allegedly lying about his whereabouts when Klein was believed to have been murdered. Police focused on Edwards during their initial investigation because he was at Abusharif and Klein's residence on March 16, 2007, during the search for Klein. He later admitted to police that he and Abusharif were \\"drug buddies who shared wild sex fantasies.\\" Initially Edwards was on a $1 million bail, which was later reduced to $500,000. After being indicted on first-degree murder charges, Abusharif was held at the DuPage County Jail on $3 million bond, later lowered to $1 million. After bonding out of jail, Abusharif was put on home confinement in her Oak Lawn apartment. However, on April 25, 2008, Abusharif violated her bail by leaving her apartment to visit a family member's home next door. Although Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Ruggiero applied to have Abusharif's bail revoked, her bail was only increased by $100,000. She returned to county jail but was back out on bail before her trial began. Trials In November 2008, Edwards went to trial on charges of obstructing justice. Villa Park police still believed he was not involved in Becky Klein's murder, but he was convicted of the obstruction charges and was sentenced to 75 days at the DuPage County, Illinois work camp. Abusharif's jury trial commenced on April 20, 2009. Edwards did not testify for the prosecution, but Sodaro did so and was joined by many members of Klein's family. Shari also testified in her own defense. When confronted with the evidence against her, she admitted lying during the police investigation. The defense hinged on whether Abusharif would have been physically able to kill Klein. Abusharif's defense attorneys, Bob Parchem and Dennis Sopata, maintained that Abusharif had a bad back and would not have been able to subdue Klein, who weighed 40 pounds more than she did. While Abusharif's attorneys were skeptical of gaining an acquittal, they were able to prove that Klein's murder was not \\"cold, calculated and premeditated,\\" as the prosecution requested. That eliminated the possibility for a sentence of life in prison without parole. Verdict and aftermath On May 5, 2009, Abusharif was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Klein after 13 hours of jury deliberation. She faced up to 60 years in prison, but Judge John Kinsella sentenced Abusharif to 50 years of incarceration. She will have to serve all of her sentence before being eligible for parole, at the age of 76. Abusharif's conviction was affirmed by the Second District of the Illinois Appellate Court on March 4, 2011.

Built and managed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for local water supply, it is also used for flood control and recreation. Cheney State Park is located on its shore. KDOT map of Reno County History The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and later the Arkansas-Red-White Basin Interagency Committee established in 1950, conducted studies on the Ninnescah River basin as part of an investigation of the broader Arkansas River basin. The investigation resulted in a water-use and control plan including the construction of reservoirs and the use of available water as a regulated supply for the city of Wichita, Kansas. Wichita needed an additional water supply to supplement its existing supply wells. The water of the Arkansas River was of poor quality and too polluted to use, leaving the Ninnescah as the next closest potential source. The Bureau of Reclamation issued a report in 1957, and the U.S. Congress authorized the construction of Cheney Dam and Reservoir in 1960. Construction began in 1962 and finished in 1965. Storage of water in the reservoir began with the closure of the river outlet works in November 1964, and delivery of water to the city of Wichita began in the summer of 1965. Conservation storage of water increased until the reservoir was filled in October 1968. Geography Cheney Reservoir is located at (37.7597113, -97.8350121) at an elevation of . It lies in south-central Kansas in the Wellington Lowlands region of the Great Plains. Most of the reservoir lies in Reno County though its southwestern portion extends into Kingman County, and a small portion along the dam lies within Sedgwick County. The junction of the three counties' borders lies in the reservoir. The reservoir is impounded at its southeastern end by Cheney Dam (National ID # KS00017). The dam is located at (37.7252898, -97.7975511) at an elevation of . The middle portion of Cheney Dam lies in the northwest corner of Sedgwick County, its southwestern end lies in Kingman County, and its northeastern end lies in Reno County. The North Fork Ninnescah River is both the reservoir's primary inflow from the northwest and its outflow to the southeast. Kansas Highway 251, which runs north-south, connects the reservoir to U.S. Route 54 to the south and the community of Cheney to the south. Below the dam, the highway becomes a paved county road and turns northeast, running parallel to the dam then finally turning east. 21st Street North, another paved county road, runs east-west immediately south of the dam. There are two settlements at Cheney Reservoir, both unincorporated: Mount Vernon, located west of the dam, and St. Joe, located east of the reservoir's southeastern end. Hydrography The surface area, surface elevation, and water volume of the reservoir fluctuate based on inflow and local climatic conditions. In terms of capacity, the Bureau of Reclamation vertically divides the reservoir into a set of pools based on volume and water level, and it considers the reservoir full when filled to the capacity of its active conservation pool. When full, Cheney Reservoir has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . When filled to maximum capacity, it has an approximate surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . The streambed underlying the reservoir has an elevation of . Infrastructure Cheney Dam has a structural height of and a length of . At its crest, it has an elevation of . Its upstream face is covered with soil cement while its downstream face consists of a layer of topsoil and grass. It has an uncontrolled spillway that leads to a conduit and stilling basin as well as two sets of outlet works: one for the river and one for Wichita's municipal water supply. Management The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation owns and operates the dam and reservoir for flood control and municipal water supply purposes as part of its Wichita Project. The City of Wichita operates a pumping facility below the dam which pipes water to a treatment plant in the city. The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWP) manages of land around the reservoir as the Cheney Wildlife Area. Parks and recreation The KDWP operates Cheney State Park located on both shores of the reservoir's southern end. The park is divided into two areas: the East Shore Area and the West Shore Area. Both areas include boat ramps, campgrounds, and swimming beaches. The East Shore Area also hosts a full-service marina, and the West Shore Area includes hiking trails as well as the Ninnescah Sailing Center. Cheney Reservoir is open for sport fishing year-round. Hunting is permitted on the public land around the reservoir although it is restricted in certain areas. In addition, certified range officers operate the Cheney Shooting Range on weekends at the north end of the Cheney Wildlife Area. Wildlife Fish species resident in the reservoir include channel catfish, crappie, striped bass, walleye, white bass, and wiper. Two invasive species, the white perch and the zebra mussel, live in the lake as well. Game animals living around the reservoir include doves, pheasants, quail, rabbits, and wild turkeys. Other land animals in the area include beavers, bobcats, muskrats, opossums, raccoons, red foxes, and skunks.

When teachers, rabbis, and other leaders have been accused of sexual abuse, authorities in the Haredi community have often failed to report offenses to Brooklyn police, intimidated witnesses, and encouraged shunning against victims and those members of the community who speak out against cases of abuse. Prevalence and under-reporting The greater New York City area is home to the largest Haredi community outside Israel. Haredim, who are often called ultra-Orthodox, though they themselves do not like that label, make up about a quarter million of New York City's population, and most of them live in Brooklyn. According to scholars, the rate of sex abuse within Haredi communities is roughly the same as anywhere else. However, for generations, most victims have not come forward with accusations because of stigmatization from the community, and when they did come forward, the matter generally stayed within the community, rather than being reported to the police and forming part of crime statistics. Sexual abuse within the community is often not reported to police. Many feel that to report a Jew to non-Jewish authorities constitutes the religious crime of mesirah: Samuel Heilman, a professor of Jewish studies at Queens College, writes that one reason why cases or patterns of sexual abuse are rarely reported to law enforcement is because \\"they think that anyone who turns over anyone to the outside authorities is committing a transgression to the community at large\\". Agudath Israel of America, a leading ultra-Orthodox organization, has stated that observant Jews should not report allegations to law enforcement without first consulting with a rabbi. Heilman adds that some wish to protect the community's reputation and the accused's family, and that the rabbis worry that outside scrutiny could weaken their authority: \\"They are more afraid of the outside world than the deviants within their own community\\", since \\"the deviants threaten individuals here or there, but the outside world threatens everyone and the entire structure of their world\\". However, other rabbis, including a Chabad-Lubavitch rabbinic court in Crown Heights and Yosef Blau, disagree, and encourage reporting abusers to police, stating that the ban on mesirah does not apply. Rather than reporting to police, Haredim may take a case of sexual abuse to the shomrim, a local Jewish street patrol. The shomrim keep the names of suspected child molesters on file, but do not share them with law enforcement or take other measures to end abuse, and sometimes try to discourage people from taking a case to the police. Reports of abuse to religious authorities rarely result in punishment for the offender; as in the Catholic sex abuse cases‚Äîwhere child molesters were re-assigned to other dioceses‚Äîrabbis, teachers, and youth leaders found to be abusing children are usually re-assigned to another yeshiva, perhaps after seeing a board of rabbis. Many of the people accused and/or convicted of sexual abuse and related charges in Brooklyn's Haredi community are rabbis. Among other accused are a school principal, a spiritual adviser, and a social worker. Reprisal Witness tampering sometimes occurs after someone is accused of sexual abuse. Victims, their families, and advocates have been threatened with violence, false police reports of child abuse, loss of kosher licenses or other harm to business, and/or eviction. They are pressured or offered bribes not to co- operate with prosecutors, and physical harassment, distribution of fliers attacking victims and advocates, and coercion occur. Establishment reprisal against sexually abused children and their parents can be severe: Parents have been shunned by the community, with rabbis forbidding congregants to speak to them, and abused children have been barred from schools. Even when cases are reported to police, they often cannot be prosecuted because victims decide not to go forward with a case, or agree to a plea deal (usually a cash payment) with the accuser, out of fear of reprisal. District Attorney Charles Hynes has stated: \\"As soon as we would give the name of a defendant ... (rabbis and others) would engage this community in a relentless search for the victims... And they're very, very good at identifying the victims. And then the victims would be intimidated and threatened, and the case would fall apart.\\" Hynes has described the intimidation that occurs in these cases as worse than anything else he has ever seen in his career, including mob cases and police corruption cases. Prosecution Brooklyn's district attorney, Charles Hynes, has had a mixed record on prosecution of these sexual abuse cases. He was praised for starting a program in 2009 called Kol Tzedek (Voice of Justice), which is geared toward ultra-Orthodox Jews and encourages them to co-operate with law enforcement; according to Hynes, it reduced the amount of victim intimidation. Since 2009, roughly 100 out of 5389 cases of sexual abuse in the district have come from the ultra-Orthodox community. The first high-profile child sex abuse case that Hynes brought against the Hasidic community, since his election in 1989, was that of Nechemya Weberman, an unlicensed youth counselor and prominent member of the Satmar community, who was convicted on December 10, 2012, of repeatedly sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl he was supposed to be counseling, and sentenced to 103 years in prison. Some victims' rights activists have still criticized Hynes, accusing him of pandering to rabbis and those in power for political reasons, and not prosecuting cases aggressively enough. Described as \\"a velvet glove wrapped around a velvet fist\\", his approach did not publicize the names of defendants, even those who were convicted of abuse, and took other steps to remain in the good graces of religious leaders who took the side of accused molesters. In one complex series of cases, for example, after a prominent cantor was convicted of sexually abusing a 16-year-old boy, the boy's father was indicted by prosecutor Hynes for extortion based in part on testimony from a supporter of the cantor. And, as of 2013, the cantor's conviction was overturned based on the parent's \\"indictment and other technicalities\\".Powell, Michael, \\"After Sexual Abuse Case, a Hasidic Accuser Is Shunned, Then Indicted\\", New York Times, June 17, 2013. Retrieved 2013-06-18. At trials for these cases, expert witnesses inform the jury that Hasidic victims often do not come forward because the community is so insular. When Rabbi Yoel Malik, 33, a member of the Satmar Hasidic sect, was given a 60-day jail sentence for the abuse of students at Ohr HaMeir, a now closed Satmar yeshiva in Borough Park, the punishment was criticized by Ben Hirsch, a spokesman for Survivors for Justice, who stated that, \\"What DA (Kenneth) Thompson has done is inexplicable\\", and claimed that, \\"Through unexplained plea deals such as this, he has effectively quashed any willingness on the part of victims to come forward\\". It was claimed that the victims were \\"extremely reluctant to testify publicly\\", according to a law enforcement source familiar with the case, as quoted in the NY Daily News.Blau, Reuven, \\"EXCLUSIVE: Brooklyn rabbi charged with teen sex assault gets 60 days in jail; DA ripped for offering light plea deal\\", New York Daily News, February 26, 2016. Victim Advocacy Rabbi Nuchem Rosenberg, an ultra-Orthodox Rabbi from the Satmar Hasidic Community in Williamsburg, created a hotline featuring weekly, impassioned lectures in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English - imploring victims to report sexual abuse to the authorities, while accusing community leaders of silencing the reporting of child abuse. Rosenberg also uses his social media presence to share his opinions on the state of child sexual abuse in the Jewish community, and chronicle his efforts and struggles as an activist. In March 2016, Rosenberg discouraged his followers from participating in a protest against the alleged cover-up of child abuse in Yeshiva Oholei Torah of Crown Heights because it was to be attended by members of the gay community. \\"We will not stand in rank together with the faggots\\", Rosenberg wrote on his blog, \\"no matter how just the cause\\". Rosenberg is often shunned by communal authorities, and there have been instances in which he was physically attacked. In 2008, fliers were posted around Williamsburg depicting a coiled snake around Rosenberg's head with the words \\"Nuchem Snake Rosenberg: Leave Tainted One!\\". Rosenberg has also been banned from Satmar synagogues by its authorities, and he alleges that he has been formally ostracized by several Rabbinic entities. Despite his decades of activism, Rosenberg has yet to be involved in the investigation, arrest, or prosecution of any member of any Jewish community for child sexual abuse. Anti-abuse community activist Rabbi Tzvi Gluck has said that in 2011, a 30-year-old man molested a 14-year-old boy in a ritual bath; this case never made it to the police due to community pressure on the victim. A rabbi made the boy apologize to the molester for seducing him. Monsey rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Jacobson has lectured on this topic, which disturbed some people, but also has brought awareness to the problem.

At his trial, where he was sentenced to 13 months in prison, the courtroom was packed with Weinberg's supporters who maintained his innocence. In response, presiding Justice Gordon L. Reichbach criticized the \\"communal attitude that seeks to blame, indeed punish, victims\\"; these victims had been kicked out of their schools and summer camps after coming forward with the allegations against Weinberg. *In 2009, Rabbi Israel Weingarten was convicted in a Brooklyn court of raping his daughter between the ages of nine and eighteen. *Some boys have reported being molested while in the mikvah, a ritual bath that is considered a symbol of purity in Judaism. *In 2011, a member of the community was charged by a local Special Victims Unit with witness tampering for sending threatening text messages to members of the Orthodox community urging them to pressure the family of an 11-year-old abuse victim to drop the case. *Pearl Engleman, a member of the Satmar sect aged 64 in 2012, said she became an anti-abuse activist after her son was molested as a child by a rabbi at his yeshiva.

The girl had initially been sent to Weberman because she had been asking theological questions. Weberman, a member of the Satmar Hasidic community, was a widely respected figure in his community, with many unwilling to believe the allegations against him. As a result, the alleged victim was harassed and labeled a \\"slut\\", while her family and boyfriend received threats. A campaign called \\"Libel 75\\", started by Weberman's supporters, allege that he is innocent. A 48-year-old man named Abraham Rubin was charged with bribery, witness tampering, and coercion in connection with the case; offering the alleged victim and her family money, while suggesting they flee to Israel to avoid testifying. Three brothers, Jacob, Joseph, and Hertzka Berger, were also charged after they threatened and then removed the kosher certificate of a restaurant run by the family of the alleged victim's boyfriend. In 2012, Weberman was convicted on all 59 charges, and received 103 years. In 2013, the three brothers admitted to the coercion charges, but received no jail time. Rubin also pleaded guilty a couple of months later, and received four months. Following Weberman's conviction, the victim and her husband continued to face abuse and repercussions.

Jungreis said he first suspected the abuse after his son came home with blood in his underwear at age 12, and later was caught touching another child on the bus. Jungreis was harassed by other members of his community for coming forward with the allegations, including receiving messages on his answering machine filled with curses. Police later arrested the suspect, 27-year-old Meir Dascalowitz. In 2013, he pleaded guilty to sexual abuse. He was released in July 2016, re-arrested for parole violation a few months later, and was re-released in December 2017. *On December 3, 2012, Emanuel Yegutkin, former principal of Elite High School for the children of Russian-American immigrants, was found guilty of sexually abusing three under-age brothers over the better part of a decade.

Located roughly north of Aleppo, the town is the administrative center of Nahiya Tell Rifaat. Nearby localities include Azaz to the north, Mare' to the east, Kafr Naya to the south, Deir Jmal and Oqayba to the southwest and Ibbin Samaan to the west. In the 2004 census, Tell Rifaat had a population of 20,514. During the Syrian Civil War, Tell Rifaat was captured by the Free Syrian Army in 2012, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in 2014, and the Islamic Front in 2015. During this time, the town was bombed several times by the Syrian government and its allies. Tell Rifaat was captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces on 16 February 2016 after heavy Russian air strikes which destroyed all three health facilities in the town. History Tell Rifaat has been inhabited since the Iron Age when it was known as \\"Arpad.\\" It became the capital of the north Syrian Aramaean state of Bit Agusi established by Gus of Yahan in the 9th- century BCE.Lipinsky, 2000, p. 195. Bit Agusi stretched from the A'zaz area in the north to Hamath in the south.Lipinsky, 2000, p. 99. Arpad later became a major vassal city of the Kingdom of Urartu. In 743 BCE, during the Urartu- Assyria War, the Neo-Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser II laid siege to Arpad following the defeat of the Urartuan army of Sarduri II at Samsat. The siege ended with the Assyrian capture of the city in 743 BCE.Healy, 1992, p. 25. Afterward Arpad served a provincial capital.Kipfer, p. 626. The remains of Arpad's walls are still preserved in Tell Rifaat to the height of 8 meters.Lipinsky, 2000, p. 529.

After the nearby Tell Aran, Tell Rifaat is the largest tell in the Jabal Sem ªƒÅn region.Lipinsky, 2000, p. 208. =Syrian Civil War= Tell Rifaat was under Syrian opposition control between 2012 and 2016. During this time, it was administered by an opposition council, whose work included managing ovens (shown above baking pita). For a period during the Syrian Civil War which began in March 2011, Tell Rifaat came under siege by Syrian security forces. During the siege, residents were unable to receive food supplies, including bread, from Aleppo. In the early summer of 2012, Syrian government authorities withdrew from Tell Rifaat following fighting with the Free Syrian Army (FSA). Following this, government authorities in the town were replaced by a council made up of local Islamic scholars, judges and former Syrian Army officers, ruling in the basis of Sharia.Zalewski, Piotr.

On 15 February 2016, the town was captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces, led by the Army of Revolutionaries. Russian airstrikes, which preceded the SDF assault, forced the majority of the population to escape. Since the SDF capture of Tell Rifaat, the town became the headquarters of the Army of Revolutionaries. After the Turkish Armed Forces and allied groups captured Afrin during Operation Olive Branch, displaced residents of Tel Rifaat rallied in Azaz to demand the expulsion of the SDF from the town. At the end of March 2018, the Syrian Republican Guard and the Russian Armed Forces entered the town.

Casa Trinxet was a building designed by the Catalan Modernisme architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch (also architect of Casa Amatller) and built during the years 1902‚Äì1904, officially considered completed in 1904. It was located at the crossroads of Carrer Balmes and Carrer del Consell de Cent, in the Eixample district of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Casa Trinxet was \\"one of the jewels of Barcelona Modernisme\\"Art Nooveau in Europe. http://www.artnouveau.eu/pdf/en/intro.pdf and one of the buildings of Barcelona's Illa de la Disc√≤rdia (\\"Block of Discord\\"), because of competing attitudes among Dom√®nech i Montaner, Puig i Cadafalch and Antoni Gaud√≠. The building was commissioned by Avelino Trinxet Casas, Mir Trinxet's Uncle, who belonged to the textile industrial family Trinxet, from Barcelona.  Mir Trinxet paintings  Joaquin Mir Trinxet (Barcelona, 1873‚Äì1940) contributed several murals to the house, after his trip to Majorca with Santiago Rusi√±ol, where he met the mystic Belgian painter William Degouve de Nuncques in 1899, and before his move to Reus. He started his work on the house in 1903 This being his major work, Mir captured his total conception of the landscape.Art Knowledge News.http://www.artknowledgenews.com/2009-05-19-06-21-34.html Mir Trinxet's style is curious in this house, paint impressionistically scattered, in contrast to his other work that is decidedly less fragmented. It is a blur of colored vision, a haze of dots that travel across the eye. In the house, Mir Trinxet use a technique that gives the painting a mysticism, an almost magical luminosity, as flowers glow as orange and yellow lamps on a bed of lush green. Here we have all the warmth and freshness of a garden, intensity provided in colored blooms, and dew that clings to leaves and grass seeped into a crisp pale green. It is a painting that transports its viewer, absorbs them into an atmosphere, fitting for a mural, which has the power to change the room it commands. These mural paintings were the most artistic period of Mir Trinxet.  Catalan Modernism in architecture and painting  Coffer and small tables from Casa Trinxet made in Ceylon satinwood with marquetry. By Josep Puig i Cadafalch ca. 1906. On display at , Barcelona In the Spanish histories of art, not only did a thriving school indeed exist in the main centers of Barcelona and Madrid, but its character was wide-ranging, bountiful, and in some cases astonishingly original. The painters who pushed Spain into the modern era in art are hardly familiar names outside Spain. Painters like Bereute, Santiago Rusi√±ol, Casas, Anglada, Pinazo, Juaquin Mir Trinxet, Regoyos, and many others, contributed to the character of Spanish painting at the dawn of the 20th century.Fondation Hermitage (Switzerland)'Modernism in Spain' The Catalan modernism is often understood as an equivalent to a number of fin-de-si√®cle art movements, such as Art Nouveau, Jugendstil, Secessionism, and Liberty style, and was active from roughly 1888 (the First International Exhibition of Barcelona) to 1911 (the death of Joan Maragall. The Modernisme movement was centered on the city of Barcelona, and is best known for its architectural expression, especially the work of Antoni Gaud√≠, but was also significant in sculpture, poetry, theatre and painting.Hughes, Robert (1993) 'Barcelona', London, , p. 253. The earliest example of Modernista architecture is the caf√© \\"Castell dels tres Dragons\\" designed by Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner in the \\"Parc de la Ciutadella\\" for the 1888 Universal Exhibition. It is a search for a particular style for Catalonia drawing on Medieval and Arab styles. Like the currents known in other countries as Art Nouveau, Jugendstil, Stile Liberty, Modern Style or Sezessionstil, Modernisme is basically derived from the English Arts and Crafts movement and the Gothic revival. As well as combining a rich variety of historically-derived elements, it is characterized by the predominance of the curve over the straight line, by rich decoration and detail, by the frequent use of vegetal and other organic motifs, the taste for asymmetry, a refined aestheticism, and the dynamic shapes.Sol√†-Morales, I, (1992) 'Arquitectura Modernista, fi de segle a Barcelona', Barcelona, . Influential architects were Antoni Gaud√≠, Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and later Josep Maria Jujol and Enrique Nieto.Mackay, David, 'Modern architecture in Barcelona, 1854‚Äì1929', Barcelona, 1985. 1893 saw the formation in Barcelona of the independent Colla del Safr√° group including, more particularly, painters Isidre Nonell i Monturiol and Joaquim Mir i Trinxet.Fondation Hermitage (Switzerland)'Modernism in Spain. http://www.fondation- hermitage.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/presse/Presse_en/MODERNISMO_DP_EN.pdf La Ilustraci√≥ Catalana published on 10 March 1907: \\"Spaniards....made already comments....about the works of Dom√®nech, Puig i Cadafalch, Sagnier, Gaud√≠ and others \\".Josep Maria Tarragona,¬®\\"La Casa Batll√≥\\".http://www.antonigaudi.org/Cat/25/63/1.htm By 1910, Modernisme had been accepted by the bourgeoisie and had turned into a fad. It was around this time that Noucentista artists started to ridicule the rebel ideas of Modernisme and propelled a more bourgeois art.  History  During the modernism period, the catal√°n bourgeoisie commissioned buildings (ocupping the principal floor) and the most wealthy constructed a house. The Casa Trinxet, like many buildings constructed at the time, it was named after its owner. It was built for the Trinxet family. Avelino Trinxet was also the owner of the Trinxet fabric, build in 1907 by Joan Alsina i Ar√∫s en Can Trinxet, in Hospitalet, near Barcelona, in a modernist fashion.News about Can Trinxet reform.http://www.digital-h.cat/web/digital-h/noticia/-/journal_content/56_INSTANCE_txR0/11023/442852 Not√≠cia reforma Can Trinxet It was located near to the Casa Serra, also planned by Josep Puig i Cadafalch (in 1903) which both in its time were two of the best examples of single-family urban houses in Barcelona. Casa Trinxet was a triumph of Modernism, exquisite in design and thus entirely decadent when it came to decoration. It had a spectacular interior. The vidres were made in picture-style appearance, like the commissioned by Trinxet to the Rigalt, Granell y C√≠a. firm in 1910‚Äì1912, following instructions from Joaqu√≠n Mir Trinxet. The Casa Trinxet was demolished in 1968 despite attempts by artists and intellectuals to save it for conversion into a museum of Modernism, in the period of Porcioles council, for the builders Nu√±ez i Navarro.Barcelona Metropolis.

It is the first tablet in the Google Nexus series of Android consumer devices marketed by Google and built by an original equipment manufacturer partner. The Nexus 7 features a display, an Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core chip, 1 GB of memory, Wi-Fi and near field communication connectivity, and 8, 16 or 32 GB of storage. The tablet was the first device to ship with version 4.1 of Android, nicknamed \\"Jelly Bean\\". By emphasizing the integration of the Google Play multimedia store with Android 4.1, Google intended to market the Nexus 7 as an entertainment device and a platform for consuming e-books, television shows, films, games, and music. Design work on the Nexus 7 began in January 2012 after a meeting between Google and Asus executives at International CES. The device's design was based on Asus' Eee Pad MeMO ME370T tablet that had been showcased at the conference. Following a hectic four-month development period during which the device was modified to reach a US$199 price point, mass production started in May. It was unveiled at the Google I/O annual developer conference on June 27, when it also became available for pre-order through Google Play. Shipping commenced in mid-July 2012 to Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, before the tablet was progressively released in other regions. Google expanded the Nexus 7 lineup in October 2012 with the introduction of 32GB versions, available in Wi-Fi‚Äìonly and HSPA+ cellular-ready varieties. The Nexus 7 received positive reviews from critics, particularly for its competitive pricing, premium-quality build, and powerful hardware. Common criticisms included the absence of cellular connectivity from initial models and no expandable storage. The Nexus 7 has been commercially successful, selling approximately 4.5‚Äì4.6 million units in 2012 and 7 million units overall. It received honors for \\"Gadget of the Year\\" and \\"Tablet of the Year\\" in T3 magazine's 2012 awards, and was also named \\"Best Mobile Tablet\\" at the 2013 Global Mobile Awards. The second generation Nexus 7 was released on July 26, 2013. History =Development phase= In an interview in December 2011, Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt announced that a Google-designed tablet computer would arrive in six months. During the interview for Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Schmidt stated that the software company would have strong competition against Apple, the designer of the iPad line of tablets. While he did not refer to it as such, the device was inferred to be part of the Google Nexus series of consumer devices using the Android operating system and built by a partnering original equipment manufacturer (OEM). According to Asus executive Benjamin Yeh, the idea for the Nexus 7 was conceived at International CES in Las Vegas in January 2012 during a meeting of executives from his company and Google. After agreeing to manufacture the device for Google as the OEM, Asus was tasked with building a tablet that could sell for US$200 and would be \\"fast, cheap, and good\\"; according to the concept of the project management triangle, only two of these qualities can be achieved. Asus chairman Jonney Shih said that the software company \\"ask[ed] a lot\\" and that \\"our engineers told me it is like torture\\". Former Android division manager Andy Rubin commented that Asus was the only company capable of designing such a product in four months. To proceed with the project, which Asus code-named \\"Project A-Team\\", the company sent a design team to Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, while Google sent seven engineers to Asus' headquarters in Taiwan. Having employees working in both locations allowed the engineering team to have a 24-hour development cycle, although Shih later needed to add 40 people to the project to meet Google's requests. The design for the Nexus 7 was based on a tablet that Asus had showcased at International CES that year, the Eee Pad MeMO ME370T. An official explained, \\"While the base design and setup was completed in the 370T to meet a certain price point and option list, the efforts required to get that design to $199 meant going back to the drawing board and starting over on just about every aspect of the unit.\\" Among the component modifications were a new motherboard, revised system on a chip (SoC), laminated display, and rear casing with a grippier material. The Nexus 7's design was completed after a relatively rapid four-month development period; mass production began in May 2012. In an analysis of its components, IHS's iSuppli estimated that the production cost of the 16 GB model of the Nexus 7 is $159.25 per unit, $19 more per unit than Amazon.com's competing tablet, the Kindle Fire. The Nexus 7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its inclusion of a camera and near field communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested that the success of the HP TouchPad's fire sale helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost tablets from major brands, and the failures of other high-end tablets helped reduce the cost of parts, making tablets like the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7 possible. However, he also noted that both tablets were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services. =Unveiling and release= Google I/O 2012 in San Francisco.alt=Smiling white man wearing black T-shirt holding a black rectangular device in his right hand. One month before its unveiling, the tablet appeared on benchmark site Rightware, which revealed that it would be an Asus-produced device known as the \\"Nexus 7\\" with a screen, a Nvidia Tegra 3 SoC, and version 4.1 of Android. On June 25, 2012, gadget website Gizmodo Australia claimed it had access to the tablet's specifications and recommended retail prices, which turned out to be correct. The Nexus 7 was revealed on June 27, 2012, at Google I/O, an annual developer conference at Moscone Center in San Francisco, and it became available for pre-order on the same day. In addition, Android version 4.1, nicknamed \\"Jelly Bean\\", was revealed during the keynote address by Hugo Barra, Director of Product Management for Android. The following day, a special white edition of the Nexus 7 was given to Google I/O attendees, along with the Galaxy Nexus with Jelly Bean pre-installed, the Nexus Q, and a Chromebox. Barra announced that the tablet would retail for $199 for the 8 GB version and that it would come with a free film, e-book, several magazines, and a $25 credit (available for redemption until September 30) to spend in Google Play, Android's digital multimedia distribution service. The Nexus 7 was interpreted by technology commentators as Google's response to the inability of Android tablets to challenge the iPads' lead of the non-phone tablet market. Shares of Google increased by 0.8 percent to $569.37 that afternoon. At the launch event, Barra announced that the tablet would initially be shipped to Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. On July 13, 2012, Google began shipping the Nexus 7 to customers in Australia and the US who had pre-ordered the tablet. The company released the Nexus 7 to Canada and the UK four days later on July 17. The tablet was released in France, Germany, and Spain on August 27, 2012, and in Japan on September 25, 2012. Two days later the tablet was released in South Korea. The Nexus 7 was progressively released to selected markets, such as Portugal and India, in the following months. Features =Software= As a Google Nexus device, the Nexus 7 offers a \\"pure Android\\" experience, as it features the stock Android operating system, free of manufacturer or wireless carrier modifications like custom graphical user interfaces (or \\"skins\\", such as TouchWiz and HTC Sense) that exist in other Android devices. Nexus products, unlike most mobile devices, have an unlockable bootloader, which allows users to replace the device's firmware, which in turn allows from the outset to \\"root\\" the device to gain privileged control over Android's environment and further develop and modify the operating system. Nexus devices are considered the \\"flagship\\" Android devices and are the first to receive updates to the operating system. As such, the Nexus 7 was the first device to have been shipped with Android version 4.1 (\\"Jelly Bean\\"). Jelly Bean was an incremental upgrade from version 4.0 (\\"Ice Cream Sandwich\\"), incorporating software improvements to the pull-down notifications bar and camera, and changes to the homescreen. With Jelly Bean, Google significantly reduced latency (lag), one negative aspect of Android compared to Apple's iOS operating system. It does so by employing \\"vsync timing\\" and triple buffering, improving touch responsiveness, and programming the display to run at 60 frames per second; this initiative was called \\"Project Butter\\". The Nexus 7 was the first device to incorporate Google Chrome for Android as the standard web browser; all previous iterations of the Android OS used an unnamed application simply called Browser. One of the most highly touted features of Jelly Bean was Google Now, an intelligent personal assistant built into the Google Search app that is similar to Apple's Siri. According to Google, Google Now displays information in the form of cards that it predicts the user would find useful based on their search habits, such as traffic conditions, sports results, and weather. Google Now can translate a selected number of written languages and provide information on nearby places of interest. Whereas Siri only works on iOS products, Google Now is available on Android and iOS devices in addition to the desktop Google Chrome web browser; users and analysts regard Google Now to be superior to Siri. Popular Science named Google Now the \\"Innovation of the Year\\" for 2012. The Nexus 7 comes with many applications by default, including Gmail, YouTube, Maps, Calendar, Google+, Google Wallet, and Currents. According to Barra, Google emphasized the integration of Google Play across Android 4.1 on the device: \\"Google Play is Nexus 7 and Nexus 7 is Google Play. So which one is it that you are selling?...Well, it's really both.\\" According to Andy Rubin, the emphasis of Google Play arose after Google learned that customers buy into an application \\"ecosystem\\" when purchasing tablets, unlike phones where hardware is the primary determining factor. The Nexus 7 is intended to take advantage of the different media formats available through the application store, including e-books, movies, music, games, magazines, and television programs. Several updates to Android were released in subsequent months, including Android 4.2 in November 2012, Android 4.3 in July 2013, and Android 4.4 (\\"KitKat\\") in November 2013. Android 5.0 (\\"Lollipop\\") was released for the Nexus 7 WiFi edition in November 2014, although users reported that the update rendered the tablet very slow.Nexus 7 fandroids tell of salty taste after sucking on Google's Lollipop ‚Ä¢ The Register Some of the issues with Android 5.0 have reportedly been addressed in an Android 5.0.2 update.http://www.xda- developers.com/android-5-0-2-nexus-7-2012-xdatv/ xda-developers.com: Android 5.0.2 Fixes 2012 Nexus 7!

The device features a Nvidia Tegra 3 SoC consisting of a 1.3 GHz Cortex-A9 quad-core central processing unit (CPU) and a twelve-core 416 MHz Nvidia GeForce ULP graphics processing unit (GPU). In conjunction with an accelerometer and gyroscope, the powerful GPU enables graphically demanding gameplay. The Tegra 3 processor, besides the four primary cores, features \\"Variable Symmetric Multiprocessing\\" that uses a fifth \\"stealth\\" core designed to take over during periods of low processor demand, helping to preserve battery life. Other features include a microphone, GPS, a magnetometer, a NFC chip with a Secure Element, and a 1.2 megapixel front- facing camera. The rear of the Nexus 7 features a dimpled plastic surface with a rubbery, leathery texture to help users to grip and hold the device. Google and Asus omitted cellular connectivity on initial models of the device, instead employing Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n as the only means for the tablet to connect to the Internet. A mobile-capable version of the device utilizing HSPA+ cellular technology with 32 GB of storage was later introduced in October 2012 for $299. Unlike most tablets, the Nexus 7 has NFC connectivity built in, which allows users to share files quickly with Android Beam and perform non-touch payments at sites that employ NFC cash registers. The Nexus 7's battery visible with the back cover removed The Nexus 7 is powered by a 4,325 mAh lithium-ion polymer battery that typically lasts 9.5 hours and can be charged via micro-USB. In order to maximize the device's battery life, Asus engineers spent one month attempting to reduce electrical leakage by measuring heat and voltage at every point on the printed circuit board (PCB). The tablet includes a highly efficient power management integrated circuit designed by Maxim Integrated Products. Google claims the Nexus 7's battery life allows 9 hours of HD video playback, 10 hours of web browsing or e-reading, and 300 hours on standby. Competing devices Kindle Fire (left) and iPad Mini (center), compared to a Nexus 7 (right) The device's LCD has a 1280√ó800-pixels resolution, giving it a density of 216 pixels per inch (PPI). Its IPS display enables a wide viewing angle (178¬∞) without significant color distortion, and enhances color reproduction. The tablet's thin, lightweight form factor was achieved without sacrificing computer power through a special LCD design called Asus TruVivid. The LCD panel uses a \\"one-glass\\" solution and a non- traditional lamination technique. Tablet touchscreens typically comprise four pieces of glass‚Äîtwo that sandwich the liquid crystal, a touch sensor glass, and a protective glass‚Äîwhereas the Asus TruVivid design fuses the protective and sensor glass, with the sensor attached as a film. The conventional lamination technique for touchscreens involves air bonding, in which the glass layers are glued around the edges, leaving air in between; Asus used a \\"full lamination\\" technique, in which the glass layers are fused by adhesive with no air between. This yielded thinner display panels, but made production more difficult, as there was less tolerance for imprecision without affecting the quality of the screen. The tablet's display is protected by a layer of Corning Fit Glass. Contrasting with the company's usual method for designing motherboards, the first components that Asus placed on the device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the headphone jack was moved to the bottom of the device, preventing the headphone wire from draping across the screen. Two models of the Nexus 7 were available at launch, one with 8 GB of storage, priced at US$199 or ¬£159, and one with 16 GB of storage, priced at $249 or ¬£199. On October 29, 2012, the Nexus 7 lineup was revised: the 8 GB model was discontinued, the price of the 16 GB version was reduced to $199, and a 32 GB variant was introduced at the $249 price point. The low cost of the Nexus 7 put it in competition with the Kindle Fire, with which it shared the same retail price. The low price of the Nexus 7 compared to higher-end tablets such as the iPad was noted by critics; Nvidia's Mike Rayfield felt that no one had ever produced a \\"truly amazing\\" device of its kind at such a price until the Nexus 7. Reception =Critical= The Nexus 7 received favorable reviews from critics. Technology commentators drew attention to its high performance, responsive display and the inclusion of Jelly Bean, as well as to NFC support. Walter Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal, David Pogue of The New York Times, and TechCrunch columnist MG Siegler acknowledged that Google and Asus had designed a serious competitor to Apple's iPad. Siegler wrote, \\"[W]ith the Nexus 7, Google has, for the first time, created an Android product that I would buy for myself. And I wouldn't have an issue recommending it to anyone else.\\" Consumer-electronics publications Ars Technica, TechRadar, and CNET Australia reviewed the product favorably. Nathan Olivarez-Giles of Wired summed up his view: Conversely, reviewers noted a lack of support for expandable storage, the initial absence of cellular connectivity, and the display's lower-than-expected contrast level, as well as an absence of a rear-facing camera. For the latter, an explanation from Asus claimed that the company decided to omit such a camera so as to not compromise the user experience and competitive pricing. Some consumers reported instances when the screen would not register inputs while the tablet performed data-intensive operations, while others complained about the build-quality of the screen. Critics in particular praised the combination of competitive retail pricing and quality of the Nexus 7\\\\. Tim Stevens of Engadget observed, \\"The Nexus 7 is an amazing package ... feels like something that could sell for much more.\\" Melissa Perenson of PCWorld voiced similar sentiments, writing: \\"Nexus 7 ... isn't like other inexpensive tablets. Its construction has a high-quality look and feel\\", and The Verge columnist Joshua Topolsky declared: \\"Google's Nexus 7 isn't just an excellent tablet for $200. It's an excellent tablet, period.\\" =Commercial= The box artwork for the Nexus 7 features an image of the tablet angled in such a way that it creates a stylized \\"7\\". During the week following the Google I/O unveiling, Google noticed an \\"immense demand\\" for the Nexus 7, resulting in many retailers having to stop accepting pre-orders for the tablet. Following release on July 13, 2012, retailers such as GameStop, Sam's Club, and Kmart announced that they had run out of stock for the tablet. Google was \\"surprised\\" by the demand for its 16 GB model, forcing it to stop accepting orders for the model on Google Play. In response to the Nexus 7, in mid-August 2012, Barnes & Noble lowered the retail prices of its Nook Tablets; the prices of the Nook Color and 8 GB Nook Tablet were cut by $20 to $149 and $179, respectively, while the 16 GB model of the Nook Tablet received a $50 price reduction from its previous retail price of $249. According to gadget site Tom's Hardware, 3‚Äì4 million units were expected to sell in 2012, which would account for most of the six million tablets Asus was expecting to sell for the year. Other sources estimated that 6‚Äì8 million units of the tablet would be shipped before the year's end. Google initially expected to sell 3 million units of the Nexus 7 by the end of 2012, but Forrester Research estimates that Google met this sales target in mid-October 2012. Asus CFO David Chang said that by October, sales of the Nexus 7 had approached 1 million units per month. In light of Google not releasing official sales figures, mobile industry analyst Benedict Evans estimated that the device most likely sold between 4.5 and 4.6 million units in 2012. According to Carphone Warehouse, the Nexus 7 is the UK retailer's highest-selling Android tablet. Following the 2012 holiday season, analytics company Localytics reported that the Nexus 7 accounted for 8% of the global Android tablet market share, based on estimates of app installations. This places it fourth among Android tablets, trailing the Kindle Fire (33%), Nook (10%), and Samsung Galaxy (9%) lines. A survey conducted by market research firm BCN in December 2012 found that the Nexus 7 had the largest tablet market share in Japan at 44.4% versus the iPads' combined market share of 40.1%. The survey cited factors such as price and consumer savvy. In July 2013, during the announcement of the second generation Nexus 7, Google executive Sundar Pichai said that over 70 million Android tablets had been activated and that the first-generation Nexus 7 comprised about 10 percent of those devices (7 million units). =Accolades= In 2012, the Nexus 7 won T3s \\"Gadget of the Year\\" award, beating rival Apple's iPhone 4S, Sony's PlayStation Vita, OnLive, and others. It also won \\"Tablet of the Year\\" in the same awards ceremony, beating Apple's new iPad, Sony's Tablet S, Samsung's Galaxy Tab 8.9, and others. CNET named the Nexus 7 the third-best tech product and the fourth-most influential tech product of 2012. At the presentation of the Global Mobile Awards at the 2013 GSMA Mobile World Congress, the Nexus 7 received the award for \\"Best Mobile Tablet\\".

The station is located from Bangkok's Thon Buri railway station and serves as a junction for the mainline Southern Line towards Pattani, Yala and Sungai Kolok (border point with Malaysia at Rantau Panjang) and the Butterworth, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore Line (border point with Malaysia at Padang Besar). The station also includes a large locomotive depot adjacent to the station. Hat Yai Junction encouraged Hat Yai's economic boom and growth, making the city larger than the province's capital Songkhla. History Originally, the station was named U-Taphao Junction and was located to the north of the current station. The old station also served as a junction for the Hat Yai-Songkhla Line. However, the junction often got hit by floods and was moved to the present location at Hat Yai Junction. In 1978, the line from Hat Yai to Songkhla City closed down, leaving the junction to be only for the mainline to Sungai-Kolok and the branch to Butterworth. Since the start of 2013, there have been plans to rebuild the line back to Songkhla City. Services There are 24 trains serving Hat Yai Junction daily, 12 each way.

It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is a regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio using a web browser.  Licensing model  The RStudio IDE is available with the GNU Affero General Public License version 3. The AGPL v3 is an open source license that guarantees the freedom to share the code. RStudio Desktop and RStudio Server are both available in free and fee-based (commercial) editions. OS support depends on the format/edition of the IDE. Prepackaged distributions of RStudio Desktop are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. RStudio Server and Server Pro run on Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat Linux, CentOS, openSUSE and SLES.  Overview and History  The RStudio IDE is partly written in the C++ programming language and uses the Qt framework for its graphical user interface. The bigger percentage of the code is written in Java. JavaScript is also amongst the languages used. Work on the RStudio IDE started around December 2010, and the first public beta version (v0.92) was officially announced in February 2011. Version 1.0 was released on 1 November 2016. Version 1.1 was released on 9 October 2017.

AMRRIC supports desexing and dog health programs to improve the situation for dogs, their owners and communities. By improving the health and welfare of companion animals, AMRRIC contributes to improved community health. AMRRIC works with a range of stakeholders and partners. It trains locally employed animal management workers, provides education programs and supports research into disease and disease prevention. AMRRIC is a non-profit organisation based in Darwin, Northern Territory, operating nationally across Australia. AMRRIC receives funding from the Australian Federal Government's Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and from the Northern Territory Government, and also relies on private and philanthropic donations. Activities AMRRIC is an independent organisation working in all areas of animal management in remote communities, including dog health and welfare, policy, research, education and capacity building. It runs programs which address animal management in a way which is sustainable, culturally sensitive and agreed upon by all parties. AMRRIC has a range of programs and projects, including: * Dog health programs which are veterinarian-led desexing programs, including anti-parasite treatment. The program reduces the problems associated with large unmanaged populations of dogs, this includes zoonotic diseases and roaming packs of dogs which show threatening behaviour towards or attacks on humans. * Animal Management Worker program which provides training, resources and employment to local Indigenous people that enables them to take responsibility for their animals‚Äô health and welfare. Animal Management Workers assist in the running of dog health programs. * Education programs designed for Indigenous school students, community members, environmental health practitioners, animal management workers and government and non- government organisations about all aspects of animal health and welfare in remote Indigenous communities. Including guidebooks for veterinarians conducting programs on Indigenous communities * Developing animal health and welfare policy with government partners which is relevant to remote Indigenous communities * Research programs including the Cancer Genome Project in Cambridge, UK, and its work on Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumour, a common disease in dogs in remote Australian communities.  Understanding the issues  Living conditions in remote Indigenous communities across Australia impact on animal and human health. There are many challenges when managing large dog populations within poorly resourced Indigenous communities. The impact of dog health on the human community is evidenced in the zoonotic diseases passed from animals to humans. In some Indigenous communities in Western Australia gastrointestinal diseases are a major problem in young children. In Western Australia, hospitalisation for gastroenteritis was 7 times higher in Aboriginal children than Non-Aboriginal children. Dogs have always been part of Indigenous communities in Australia and have many roles including, hunters, companions and guard dogs. Although beliefs about the spiritual significance of dogs vary in from community to community, dogs occupy an important place in culture and the community. It is essential to understand the strong cultural tradition of living with companion animals when developing and delivering animal health and management programs.Constable S., Dixon RM and Dixon RJ, 2010 ‚ÄúFor the Love of Dog: The Human - Animal Bond in Rural and Remote Australian Indigenous Communities.‚Äù Anthrozoos (in press) The problem of unmanaged dogs When there are no veterinary services available to a remote community, large unmanaged populations of dogs flourish.

It traces its history back to 1313 but the current Baroque buildings date from 1775. Owned by Horsens Municipality, the main building is now run as a hotel while the associated land is a public park and used as fair grounds. History Bygholm Castle was founded in 1313 upon orders from King Eric VI Menved following a revolt among peasants in Jutland. The castle was run by a vassal (lensmand). The most famous of these to reside at Bygholm was Erik Lange, who belonged to the circle around Tycho Brahe but experienced economic ruin, experimented with alchemy and left Bygholm in a state of neglect. As a result, and possibly after a fire in the beginning of the 17th century, later vassals preferred to reside at nearby Stjernholm and the name of the fee was changed accordingly. In 1661, Frederick III ceded the estate to Peder von Ufelen from Hamburg. In 1670 he sold it to Joachim Werner B√ºlow, who rebuilt Bygholm and returned it to its former state of a manor. Horsens Municipality acquired the estate in 1918. Architecture The current main building was built in 1775 to a symmetrical Baroque design by Andreas M√∏ller. It consists of a one-storey main wing with a three-bay central projection, flanked by two lower L-shaped lateral wings. It was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in 1984. The farm buildings are of somewhat younger origins and are not listed. Bygholm today The main wing The main building is now run as a hotel (Scandic Bygholm Park).

The Kurjer Lubelski discussed here is also to be distinguished from several historical publications, including (2) the Nowy Kurjer Lubelski (\\"The New Lublin Courier\\") published by Franciszek Papiewski in 19131914; and (3) the newspaper of the same title, Kurjer Lubelski, an economic weekly published in 19151916 by Wanda Papiewska, Jan Hempel and Oktawian Zagrobski (40 issues in all; full title: Kurjer Lubelski: tygodnik spo≈Çeczno-ekonomiczny, popularno-naukowy i literacki),Cf.

Wojtysiak. Publication history =Precursor phase (18301831)= The original Kuryer Lubelski, the precursor to all its subsequent incarnations, began publication as a de facto revolutionary organ that appeared for some 59 days as a four- page daily (no publication on Saturdays) between 9 December 1830 and 5 February 1831 during the November Uprising. The frequency of publication was alternately six numbers a week, three numbers a week, and irregularly.Materia≈Çy i Studia do Historii Prasy i Czasopi≈õmiennictwa Polskiego, fasc. 1 (Bibliografia prasy polskiej, 19441948: prasa krajowa, ed.

It was printed clandestinely at the (antiquated by the 19th-century standards) Drukarnia RzƒÖdowa printing press on handmade paper of inferior quality. Any issue of the original series would constitute at present an extremely rare bibliophile item, with only a handful of known copies (according to some estimates, exactly seventeen in number), of various dates, being preserved in library holdings worldwide.Czes≈Çaw Iskra, \\"Drukarnia Trynitarzy i Drukarnia RzƒÖdowa w latach 17811832\\"; in: Studia z dziej√≥w drukarstwa i ksiƒôgarstwa w Lublinie w XIX i XX wieku, ed.

The founder, publisher, editor-in-chief, and primary contributor was Jan Czy≈Ñski (18011867).Publication history I. =Phase I (18651879) & phase II (19061913)= The modern-era Kurjer Lubelski, without an obvious connection to the original revolutionary broadsheet, commenced publication with the issue of 18 (30) December 1865,See the first issue online. with the frequency of publication of two issues per week: it was founded by Julian Konrad Liedtke (18351870). The first publisher of the newspaper was W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jan Kossakowski (18331870), with Liedtke as the first editor-in-chief.Publication history II. The editorship was taken over by Lucjan Dembowski in 1869 (beginning with vol. 4, No. 1), and again in the same year by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Wdowi≈Ñski (beginning with vol. 4, No. 97). From 1875 onwards the editor-in-chief was Teofil G≈Çƒôbocki. The paper was often published with extra supplements with separate mastheads that read, Dodatek do Nr... Kurjera Lubelskiego (\\"Supplement to No... of The Kurjer Lubelski\\"), etc. The frequency (as well as the format) of publication underwent significant variations throughout the newspaper's history, but it was not a daily newspaper (excluding Sundays and bank holidays) until 1878. From 1875 the newspaper appeared without the volume number being indicated in the masthead. In 1879 the publication merged with the Gazeta Lubelska and continued publication under the latter title not to be reactivated independently as Kurjer Lubelski until 1906 when this was done on the initiative of Mieczys≈Çaw Biernacki whose efforts spelled the beginning of a golden age in the newspaper's life. The first issue of the revived Kurjer Lubelski, published on 4 January 1906 under the editorship of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Stodolnicki, was initially followed by only 15 additional numbers.Publication history III. However, the newspaper survived, rising to the premier position among the press of the Lublin Land, until it was banned by the censorship of the Russian Empire on 27 June 1913.H.

It ceased publication with the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. =Phase IV (1932)= The newspaper was yet again revived in independent Poland in 1932, the paper now being published with the subtitle: Kurjer Lubelski: pismo codzienne (\\"The Lublin Courier: A Daily Newspaper); it managed to stay afloat for less than one year due to financial difficulties caused in part by the loss of government advertising and by the frequent confiscations of whole print runs of individual issues by the Sanacja r√©gime.Publication history VI. The editorial board of the Kurjer Lubelski was known for its impartiality and tolerance of a broad spectrum of views: the editorial line was to support the government of the day without any political partisanship while at the same time championing the rights of the individual citizen.M. Biernacki, \\"Zmartwychwstanie Kurjera\\" (The Resurrection of the Kurjer), Kurjer Lubelski, vol. 10, No. 1, 1 January 1932, p. 1\\\\. (See online.) From 1 January to 11 May 1932 the Kurjer Lubelski was being edited and published by the poet J√≥zef Czechowicz,Feliks Tomaszewski, \\"J√≥zef Czechowicz\\"; on the Wirtualna Biblioteka Literatury Polskiej (Virtual Library of Polish Literature) portal. (See online.) followed in the post of the editor-in-chief by Zygmunt Grochowski, and then again from 15 October 1932 by another poet, J√≥zef ≈Åobodowski, and lastly from 20 November 1932 by Longin Koz≈Çowski. The paper folded after the issue of 30 November 1932. While economically unviable, the publication enjoyed the high reputation stemming from its association in the past with such notable Polish writers as Stefan ≈ªeromski, who had honoured it with his contributions. It had a distinct literary profile during this phase, publishing among others the works of such distinguished poets as J√≥zef Czechowicz, J√≥zef ≈Åobodowski, Franciszka Arnsztajnowa, Bronis≈Çaw Ludwik Michalski (19031935), Antoni Madej (18991989), Zygmunt Karski (18981967), Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, and Jadwiga Gamska-≈Åempicka (19031956), as well as the prose writings by Franciszka Arnsztajnowa (novellas), Marian Piechal (19051989), and Aniela Fleszarowa, the author of Celofanki: poematy prozƒÖ (1939).Aniela Fleszarowa, Celofanki: (poematy prozƒÖ), Nowogr√≥dek, Ksiƒôgarnia Polska, 1939. =Phase V (1937)= Finally, the paper was briefly revived one last time between 22 March 1937 and 2 April 1937, by J√≥zef ≈Åobodowski, its penultimate editor in the previous phase of 1932, under the unaltered title of Kurjer Lubelski: pismo codzienne. However, it folded after just nine issues owing to the insuperable competition from nationwide newspapers branching out into mass-market regional spinoffs that flooded the Lublin market, making a publication like the Kurjer Lubelski targeted as it was primarily to the much smaller intelligentsia segment of the reading public unable to compete with the economies of scale and market dominance of the larger corporates.Publication history VII. Cf. Wojtysiak. For reasons not entirely clear, copies of the Kurjer Lubelski belonging to the Phase V series are extremely rare, potentially constituting valuable bibliophile items (no copy is known to have been preserved in library holdings anywhere).Publication history VII.

Kennedy on January 17, 1962 that recognized the right of federal employees to collective bargaining. This executive order was a breakthrough for public sector workers, who were not protected under the 1935 Wagner Act. Passage of the executive order forestalled the legislative Rhodes- Johnson Union Recognition bill, which would have given more power to federal employee unions, possibly creating a union shop arrangement. Executive Order 10988 was effectively replaced by President Richard Nixon's Executive Order 11491 in 1969. Contents Workers gained the right to join unions and other organizations of workers; however they were not permitted to strike‚Äîfederal strikes had been explicitly prohibited in 1947 by the Taft-Hartley Act‚Äîor to join the leadership of these groups. Until 1978, federal workers had to take unpaid time off to participate in collective bargaining themselves. The order in some ways went further than the Wagner Act, instructing agencies to develop informal relationships with employee organizations (so long as they are not corrupt or undemocratic) and not to campaign against them. In fact, the order asks agencies to seek their input with \\"affirmative willingness\\". However, the order does not require \\"good faith negotiations\\", as the Wagner Act does. And because federal workers are not allowed to strike, labor disputes can only legally reach the point of an \\"impasse\\". An impasse can be resolved by appeals to mediators, fact-finders, or a higher authority‚Äîor it can be ignored by management, and the status quo allowed to continue. The order explicitly does not apply to intelligence agencies. It also gives agency heads the right to suspend its rules for operations outside of the United States. Effect Union membership among federal employees increased several times over in the next decade. This effect boosted even longstanding federal unions, such as the National Federation of Federal Employees. This expansion led President Lyndon B. Johnson to form the Presidential Review Committee on Employee-Management Relations in the Federal Service. =Military= There had been some history of unionizing in the military before 1961, and when the order was passed around 10% of service members were part of outside organizations. By 1968 these figures had risen: 39% of the Army, 44% of the Air Force, and 53% of the Navy belonged to employee organizations. The order yielded many collective bargaining agreements, which have generally provided for arbitration in labor grievances. =Public sector= Labor historians believe that Executive Order 10988 served as a model for public sector unionism, even for local, municipal and state employees. Membership in AFSCME increased substantially during the 1960s and 1970s, and 22 states legalized collective bargaining for public sector workers. Public sector strikes also increased many times over. In June 2018, the Supreme Court decision in the case of Janus v. AFSCME found that application of public sector union fees to government employees who are not union members represents compelled speech, and as such is a violation of First Amendment rights. This decision by the Supreme Court potentially reduces funding for Unions that represent Federal Government employees. Some have proposed repeal of Executive Order 10988, which could potentially occur if the President were to issue an executive order vacating Executive Order 10988.https://www.wsj.com/articles/time-to-repeal-jfks-executive- order-10988-1528411962 References 10988 Category:1962 in American law Category:1962 in American politics Category:History of labor relations in the United States Category:1962 in labor relations ","title":"Executive Order 10988"},{"id":"36691678","text":"Blending Times is Ravi Coltrane's fifth album as a band leader, and second for Savoy Records.

Built and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, it is used for flood control, recreation, and water supply. History The Flood Control Act of 1950 authorized the building of Council Grove Dam and Lake, named after the nearby community of Council Grove, Kansas. The effects of the Great Flood of 1951 further demonstrated the need for the project, and the Tulsa District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction in June 1960. The reservoir was completed at a total cost of $11.5 million and became operational for flood control on October 9, 1964. Geography Council Grove Lake is located at (38.6997978, -96.5195795) at an elevation of . It lies in the Flint Hills in east-central Kansas. The entirety of the reservoir lies within Morris County. The reservoir is impounded at its southeastern end by Council Grove Dam. The dam is located at (38.6805627, -96.5044475) at an elevation of . The reservoir consists of two arms: a western arm whose primary inflow is the Neosho River from the northwest and an eastern arm whose primary inflow is Munkers Creek from the northeast. The Neosho River is the reservoir's outflow to the southeast. Smaller tributaries of the western arm are Slough Creek from the north and Canning Creek from the southwest; other tributaries of the eastern arm include Short Creek from the north and Richey Creek from the east. U.S. Route 56 runs generally east-west roughly south of the reservoir. Kansas Highway 177 runs generally north-south along the reservoir's eastern shore. Lake Road, a paved county road, runs along the southwest shore. The reservoir's namesake, the city of Council Grove, lies approximately southeast of the dam. Hydrography The surface area, surface elevation, and water volume of the reservoir fluctuate based on inflow and local climatic conditions. In terms of capacity, the Corps of Engineers vertically divides the reservoir into a set of pools based on volume and water level, and the reservoir is considered full when filled to the capacity of its conservation pool. When full, Council Grove Lake has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . When filled to maximum capacity, it has a surface elevation of and a volume of . The streambed underlying the reservoir has an elevation of . Infrastructure Council Grove Dam is a rolled earth-fill embankment dam that stands above the streambed and long. At its crest, the dam has an elevation of . An uncontrolled, wide spillway is located at the southwest end of the dam. It has a maximum flow capacity of . Additional outlet works include a wide conduit and a wide low-flow outlet. At the top of the flood control pool, these outlet works have a flow capacity of . The Neosho River channel below the dam has a capacity of . Management The Tulsa District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages Council Grove Dam and Reservoir for the purposes of flood control, recreation, water quality control, and water supply. The Corps oversees recreational activities both on the reservoir surface and in the parks on its shore. The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWP) manages approximately of land around the reservoir's northern ends as the Council Grove Wildlife Area. Parks and recreation The Corps of Engineers manages eight parks at the reservoir: Canning Creek Cove, Santa Fe Trail, Marina Cove, and Neosho Park on the southwest shore and Custer Park, Kit Carson Cove, Richey Cove, and Kansa View on the eastern shore. All eight parks include campgrounds, and all but Kansa View host boat ramps. Canning Creek Cove, Neosho Park, and Richey Cove have hiking trails. Council Grove Lake's one swimming beach is at Richey Cove. Council Grove Lake is open for sport-fishing. Hunting is allowed, with restrictions in some areas, on the public land around the reservoir. Wildlife Fish species resident in the lake include black bass, channel and flathead catfish, crappie, saugeye, white bass, and wiper. One invasive species, the zebra mussel, is also present. Game animals living on land around the reservoir include doves, quail, rabbits, squirrels, turkeys, and white- tailed deer.

Thanks to an agreement with,Avelino Trinxet Casas he was able to work as a painterMuseum Library \\"Victor Balaguer\\", dossier and in 1899 Mir went to Mallorca with Santiago Rusi√±ol, where he met the mystic Belgian painter William Degouve de Nuncques, whose work would influence his own. Working in isolated circumstances in Mallorca, Mir painted odd landscapes in which forms and chromatic colors merged. In his first exhibition in Barcelona in 1901, the critical reviews were positive but the public found his paintings difficult to comprehend. He started in Mallorca a solitary artistic process, full of colors without forms, which finished when he suffered an accident in 1905. In 1913 he returned to more realistic positions, receiving recognition for his work. From this period, his paintings tended to become more mystic, more abstract, and highly colored evocations of nature rather than topographical scenes. Among the artists he met in this period of his life, and who influenced him, were Laure√† Barrau, Santiago Rusi√±ol, Eug√®ne Carri√®re, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, and Ignacio Zuloaga. He was one of the rare Spanish painters of the period who did not continue his artistic education in Paris. But he visited Ramon Casas i Carb√≥ (Casas) and Rusi√±ol, who lived together at the Moulin de la Galette in Montmartre, regularly, along with painter and art critic Miquel Utrillo and the sketch artist Ramon Canudas. Rusi√±ol chronicled these times in a series of articles \\"Desde el Molino\\" (\\"From the Mill\\") for La Vanguardia. He had not the same influence from the French impressionists as Casas. The style that would become known as modernisme had not yet fully come together, but the key people were beginning to know one another, and successful Catalan artists were increasingly coming to identify themselves with Barcelona as much as with Paris. Meanwhile, the bohemian circle that included Casas and Rusi√±ol began with greater frequency to organize exhibitions of their own in Barcelona and Sitges. With this increasing activity in Catalonia, he settled more in or around Barcelona. Mir Trinxet contributed several murals to Casa Trinxet after his trip to Majorca with Santiago Rusi√±ol, where he met the mystic Belgian painter William Degouve de Nuncques in 1899, and before his move to Reus. He started his work in the house in 1903. The personal papers of Joaquim Mir are preserved in the Biblioteca de Catalunya.

Mir Trinxet summed up his private art manifesto in 1928: \\"All I want is for my works to lighten the heart and flood the eyes and the soul with light.\\" Colour and light meant everything to Mir, and he used them to build a personal idiom in which he created a surprisingly modern oeuvre, beyond the art movements like Impressionism or Symbolism with which critics have often sought to associate him. Although his artistic development varied between realism and abstraction, two features crop up throughout his entire output: the urge to establish a new vision of nature and an unremitting search for beauty marked by genuine creative tension.Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao offers the Art Archives of Joaquim Mir, Art Knowledge News Mir Trinxet painted landscapes in Tarragona and Majorca (perhaps his best known works, and certainly the ones that contributed most to create the myth of the artist that merged with nature and lost himself in a delirium of light and colour). In his late works created in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫, Mir Trinxet intensified the realist side of his work. He also produced works during his campaigns in places like Andorra, Montserrat, Miravet and Gualba. Casa Trinxet Casa Trinxet Special consideration has the major works for the Casa Trinxet in Barcelona, in which Mir Trinxet captured his total conception of the landscape. Casa Trinxet was a building designed by Catalan Modernistarchitect Josep Puig i Cadafalch and built during the years 1902‚Äì1904, in the Eixample district of Barecelona. Casa Trinxet was \\"one of the jewels of Barcelona Modernism\\" and one of the buildings of Barcelona's Illa de la Disc√≤rdia (\\"Block of Discord\\"), because of the competing attitudes of Dom√®nech i Montaner, Puig i Cadafalch and Antoni Gaud√≠. The building was commissioned by Mir Trinxet's uncle Avelino Trinxet Casas, of the textile industry family Trinxet, from Barcelona. Avelino Trinxet was also the owner of the Trinxet factory built in 1907 by Joan Alsina i Ar√∫s in Can Trinxet, Hospitalet, near Barcelona, in a modernist fashion.News about Can Trinxet reform - Not√≠cia reforma Can Trinxet Mir Trinxet's style is curious in this house, paint impressionistically scattered, opposed to his other, decidedly less fragmented, work that. It is a blur of colored vision, a haze of dots that travel across the eye. In the house, Mir Trinxet use a technique that gives the painting a mysticism, an almost magical luminosity, as flowers glow as orange and yellow lamps on a bed of lush green. Here we have all the warmth and freshness of a garden, intensity provided in colored blooms, and dew that clings to leaves and grass seeped into a crisp pale green. It is a painting that transports its viewer, absorbs them into an atmosphere, fitting for a mural, which has the power to change He showed his interest for the decorativisme in his work for Casa Trinxet. The vidres were made in picture-style appearance, like the commissioned by Trinxet from the Rigalt, Granell y C√≠a. firm in 1910-1912, following instructions from Joaqu√≠n Mir Trinxet. The Casa Trinxet was demolished in 1968 despite attempts by artists and intellectuals to save it for conversion into a museum of Modernism, in the period of Porcioles council, for the builders Nu√±ez i Navarro. Lastly movements were late to save Casa Trinxet. Red Earth (1921). 107 √ó 101 cm. Fundaci√≥n Banco Santander. Impressionist, landscape artist It is true that the range of colours in his palette coincided with the one the Impressionists used; he also coincided with them in excluding the colour black, using a host of combinations to paint shadow. But Mir used these technical resources to create a world of his own, a new landscape. Rather than assimilate and reproduce the theories predominating at the time, his work developed more out of an inner need brought into being by his idiosyncratic way of looking at nature and light. Essentially, Mir was a landscape artist who took the landscape into a new, as yet unknown dimension. To do so, he played with and revamped a broad range of complementary colours. This is the key to the power of colour in Mir's painting and the tool that enabled him to structure his works on colour rather than form, imbuing his landscapes with genuine soul. His style was followed by Salvador Masana.Museum Library \\"Victor Balaguer\\", Vilanova, Dossier Mir Trinxet as a film director There is a great audiovisual work, which, under the title Mir's moving eye, presents his activities as an amateur film director for the first time. Now in the artist's son's collection, the films were shot between 1930 and 1936, as his life drew to a close. With this tool, viewers will also have a chance to see what life was like in the Mir family and compare real scenes with the results in his works. Catalan modernism In January 2011, the Fondation de l'Hermitage in Lausanne organized a major exhibition devoted to Spanish art at the dawn of the 20th century. Focusing on painters of ‚ÄúThe Generation of 1898‚Äù who emerged from the severe upheavals endured by Spain throughout the 19th century, the exhibition highlights how these artists evolved. Oscillating between respect for Hispanic traditions and modernity, their works were part of the contemporary surge to broaden horizons that arose among the Spanish avant- garde. The Fondation de l'Hermitage selected several works of Joaquin Mir Trinxet. According to the Fondation: \\"The painters who pushed and cajoled Spain into the modern era in art are hardly familiar names outside Spain: Bereute, Santiago Rusi√±ol, Casas, Anglada, Pinazo, Juaquin Mir Trinxet, Regoyos, and many others, are all but forgotten figures outside of Spain who nevertheless decidedly contributed to the character of Spanish painting at the dawn of the 20th century\\". Els Quatre Gats The emerging modernista art world gained a center with the opening of Els Quatre Gats, a bar modeled on Le Chat Noir in Paris. Casas largely financed this bar on the ground floor of Casa Mart√≠, a building by Architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, the designer of Casa Trinxet, in Montsi√≥ Street near the center of Barcelona; it opened in June 1897 and lasted for six years (and was later reconstructed in 1978). The bar hosted tertulias and revolving art exhibits, including one of the first one-man shows by Pablo Picasso. Like Le Chat Noir, Els Quatre Gats attempted its own literary and artistic magazine. That was short-lived, but was soon followed by P√®l & Ploma, which would slightly outlast the bar itself, and Forma (1904-1908). P√®l & Ploma sponsored several prominent art exhibitions. It is not clear if Mir Trinxet was a frequent or infrequent habitu√© of El Quatre Gats, where he met many of the modernist painters. Mir Trinxet, sometimes, like Casas, adopted the art nouveau style that would come to define modernisme.

The relative efficiency of braille can be seen, as the line at the bottom is the braille transcription for the first two lines of decapoint: je vous prie de commander une planche pour la grille ci-jointe The decapoint alphabet, digits, and punctuationRaphigraphe on view in museum in Finland. Decapoint, or raphigraphy, was a tactile form of the Latin script invented by Louis Braille as a system that could be used by both the blind and sighted. It was published in 1839. Letters retained their linear form, and so were legible without training to the sighted, but the lines were composed of embossed dots like those used in braille. Each letter contained ten dots in the height and different dots in the width to produce the graphic form of print. The reason for the development of this writing was that relatives of the students could not read braille. These letters were not easy for the blind to write because of their height of ten dots despite grid. It therefore did not take long for the blind friend of Louis Braille, Pierre-Fran√ßois-Victor Foucault, to build in 1841 the first apparatus, the Raphigraph, which could push all the points of one column of characters at the same time into the paper. This font was now named Raphigraphy (Raphigrafie or Raphigraphie). When the first typewriters were invented, they repressed quickly the complicated Raphigraphy or decapoint, despite the impossibility for the blind to read the writing of typewriters. And so the Decapoint or Raphigraphy fell into oblivion, but it was the first digital font of Latin letters ever.

Francis Milner Newton (London 1720 - 14 August 1794 Corfe) was an English portrait painter and first secretary of the Royal Academy. Life Newton was a pupil of Marcus Tuscher, a German artist living in England, and also studied at Hogarth's St Martin's Lane Academy. In October 1753 he was one of a group of artists who drew up a prospectus for the establishment of a national academy of art. The plan came to nothing, but in 1755 a committee of artists was formed for a similar purpose, and Newton was appointed secretary, but with no more success. A more successful meeting of artists was held at the Turk's Head tavern on 12 November. 1759, and a committee of sixteen artists was set up, with Newton once again acting as secretary.Pye 1845, p.92 The following spring, an exhibition organised by the committee was held in the gallery of the Society of Arts in the Strand,Pye 1845, pp.92‚Äì3 to which Newton contributed a portrait. Following disagreements with the Society of Arts, it was decided to hire an auctioneer's rooms in Spring Gardens for the group's second exhibition in 1761.Pye, 1845. p.97 By the time the exhibition came to be held, a schism had taken place among the artists.Pye 1845, p.99 One faction, exhibiting at Spring Gardens, advertised itself as the \\"Society of Artists of Great Britain\\", with Newton named as its secretary.

In 1768 a further schism took place within the Incorporated Society, as a result of which Newton and some of its directors, were ejected. The excluded artists formed themselves into a new society, and by obtaining the patronage of the king, George III, brought about the foundation of the Royal Academy of Arts, under the presidency of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Newton was elected their first secretary, a post he held until his resignation in 1788. John Evan Hodgson, a later librarian of the Academy, said of him: > he was not a great artist, and is absolutely unknown to fame; but he > occupied a very honourable position and performed its duties worthily; he > lived in stirring times, with great men as his friends and associates; we > are bound to respect his memory, and can only regret that we do not know > more of him. He exhibited eight portraits at the academy between 1769 and 1774. His address is given in the catalogues as Mortimer Street in the first year, and Portland Street after that date. Newton lived at Hammersmith in west London for some years, until inheriting Barton Grange, a property at Corfe belonging to his mother's family, where he spent the rest of his life. He died there on 14 August 1794, and was buried at Corfe. He left one child, Josepha Sophia.

She was regent of Armenia during the absence of her spouse and son in 368-370, and is famous for her defense of the fortress of Artogerassa against Persia.

Pharantzem's mother was an unnamed noblewoman from the Mamikonian family and she had at least one known sibling, a brother called Babik (Bagben) who served as a Naxarar of Syunik in 379. Little is known on her early life. Pharantzem was extremely well known for her beauty and modesty.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 First marriage Pharantzem in 359 married the Arsacid Prince Gnel.Hovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.89 Gnel was the son of the Arsacid Prince TiridatesGibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire whose brother was Arsaces II (Arshak II)Hovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.89 who ruled as Roman Client King of Armenia from 350 until 368. During the reign of Arsaces II, Gnel was a popular prince in ArmeniaGibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and could have been seen as a potential successor to his uncle. Pharantzem's reputation for her beauty had become renown and widespread to the point as Gnel's paternal cousin Tirit had become passionately in love with her and desired her to be his wife.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Finding a way to plot against his cousin Gnel, Tirit approached their uncle Arsaces II and said to him: ‚ÄúGnel wants to rule, and to kill you. All the grandees, the Naxarars and the Azats like Gnel and all the Naxarars of the land prefer his lordship over them than yours. Now they say, ‚Äòlook and see what you do, king, so that you can save yourself‚Äù.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Believing the words of Tirit, Arsaces II became agitated and did confirm the statements of Tirit.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 =Murder of Gnel= Arsaces II from then until Gnel's death had a grudge against Gnel which he had frequently tried to persecute and plot treachery against him for a long time.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 From that moment Gnel was on the run with Pharantzem from Arsaces II. Arsaces II did eventually kill Gnel around the time of the festival of Nawasard (which was held in August) as his falsely lured his nephew and Pharantzem into Shahapivan a native camping place of the Arsacids which was below a walled hunting preserve based on a lie that Arsaces II wanted to reconcile with Gnel.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 When Gnel was captured by Arsaces II's soldiers he was taken to a nearby hill of the mountain called Lsin where he was executed.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 After the death and burial of Gnel, Arsaces II issued an order to mourn the death of his nephew which Arsaces II weep and mourn for Gnel greatly while Pharantzem mourned so much for Gnel she tore off her clothes, was screaming and cried so much.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Now Tirit had successfully got rid of his cousin, he was unable to control his lust for Pharantzem. Tirit had sent his messenger to Pharantzem a note reading: ‚ÄúDo not mourn so much, for I am a better man that he was. I loved you and therefore betrayed him to death, so that I could take you in marriage‚Äù.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 In her mourning Pharantzem, raised a protest, pulling out her hair and screaming as she mourned that her husband died because of her. When the Armenians in particular Arsaces II heard the cries of Pharantzem, Arsaces II began to realise the plotting of Tirit and the senseless death of Gnel. Arsaces II was stunned in what happened and had regretted in killing Gnel. For a while Arsaces II, didn't do anything to Tirit. Tirit had sent a message to Arsaces II stating, ‚ÄúKing, I want you to order that I be allowed to marry Gnel‚Äôs wife‚Äù.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 As Arsaces II heard this he said: ‚ÄúNow I know for sure that what I have heard is accurate. Gnel‚Äôs death occurred for his wife‚Äù.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Arsaces II planned to kill Tirit in return for Gnel's murder. When Tirit heard this, he was in so much fear for Arsaces II he fled at night. Arsaces II was informed that Tirit had left and ordered his soldiers to find Tirit and kill him. His soldiers found Tirit in the forests in the district of Basen and killed him there.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Second marriage After the death of Tirit, Arsaces II married Pharantzem. Pharantzem married Arsaces II as her second husband. At the same time as Arsaces II had Pharantzem as his wife, he also had another wife, a Greek Cretan noblewoman woman called Olympia, also known as OlympiasHovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.89Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 whom he married before marrying Pharantzem.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Olympia the Roman wife of Arsaces II,Kurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.105 was given to him as an imperial bride from the Roman emperor Constantius II as Arsaces II was greatly favored by the emperor,Hovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.89 who considered him as an ally to Rome. Although the Romans considered Olympia as the legitimate wife of Arsaces II, he loved Pharantzem to a degree but Pharantzem loathed Arsaces II saying, ‚ÄúPhysically, he is hairy, and his color is dark‚Äù.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Arsaces II loved Olympia more than Pharantzem.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Through marriage to Arsaces II, Pharantzem became an Armenian Queen consort and a very powerful, wealthy and influential woman in Armenian society. Sometime after her marriage to Arsaces II, Pharantzem fell pregnant. In 360 Pharantzem bore Arsaces II a son, whom they named Papas (Pap).Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Papas was the only known child born to Pharantzem and the only known child born to Arsaces II during his Armenian Kingship. Pharantzem was also a stepmother to Anob, as Anob was the first son of Arsaces II born to him from a previous union prior to his Kingship of Armenia.According to Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the priest & historiographer of the Catholicos Nerses the Great, gives the name Anob as the father of Papas‚Äô nephew Varasdates (Varazdat). Also according to Faustus of Byzantium, Book IV - Chapter 37 Varasdates proclaims himself as the nephew of Papas =Queen of Armenia= As Arsaces II in Persian fashion had more than one wifeHovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.89 Pharantzem had a grudge and had a great envy against Olympia.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 After the birth of her son, Pharantzem plotted to kill Olympia through poison.

Olympia was extremely careful in where she accepted matters of food and drink from as she only accepted food and drink offered to her from her maids.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 The behaviours, actions of Pharantzem and Arsaces II, in particular the deaths of Gnel, Tirit, Olympia and possibly the prior ruling King of Armenia Tigranes VII (Tiran) had totally outraged the reigning Catholicos St. Nerses I. The church was totally alienated from the royal court of Arsaces II and St. Nerses I was not seen again in the royal court in the lifetime of Arsaces II.Hovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.89 Although Pharantzem was hostile to any Sassanid influence from Persia; the actions of Pharantzem towards Olympia had placed Armenian politics unfavorable to Christian interests and she was considered an impious woman.Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire After the death of Olympia, Pharantzem became the Armenian Queen. In the year 367 or 368 the Sassanid King Shapur II, had turned to treachery to capture Arsaces II as he was taken as a political prisoner by the Sassanid monarch, in which Arsaces II had died in prison. This was a part of Shapur II's plan to conquer Armenia once and for all, as Shapur II was in military conflict and failed diplomatic treaties with the Roman emperors Jovian and Valens. Shapur II after successfully capturing Arsaces II, he sent his army to invade Armenia.Lenski, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., p.170 =Defender of Artogerassa= When the Sassanid army were heading to invade Armenia, Pharantzem and her son, Papas took the Armenian treasury and hid themselves in the fortress of Artogerassa,Lenski, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., p.170 where the fortress was defended by a troops of Azats.

Pharantzem appealed to them in the name of her husband.Lenski, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., p.171 Cylaces and Artabanes defected from Shapur II to Pharantzem in which Papas for his safety was sent to Anatolia to the court of Valens.Lenski, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., p.171 Papas during his time with Valens was in communication with his mother from the fortress whom he encouraged to await his rescue.Lenski, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., p.171 Valens was working to restore Papas to the Arsacid throne and withdraw the army of Shapur II from Armenia.Lenski, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., p.172 When Shapur II heard of Papas‚Äô restoration to Armenia, instead of going after Papas personally he concentrated in capturing Pharantzem; ending her siege in the fortress of ArtogerassaLenski, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., p.172 and invading Armenia. The Persian forces that were sent by Shapur II finally conquered Armenia and captured the fortress after two years.Lenski, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., p.172 Pharantzem bravely defended herself and Armenia for 2 years from Shapur II, which famine and disease had left few survivors out of 11,000 soldiers and 6,000 women who had taken refuge in the fortress.Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Pharantzem with the Armenian royal treasure were taken to the palace of Shapur II.

The result was stated as a problem by Rad√≥ and solved shortly afterwards by Kneser in 1926. Choquet, unaware of the work of Rad√≥ and Kneser, rediscovered the result with a different proof in 1945. Choquet also generalized the result to the Poisson integral of a homeomorphism from the unit circle to a simple Jordan curve bounding a convex region. Statement Let f be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the unit circle z = 1 in C and define the Poisson integral of f by :\\\\displaystyle{F_f(re^{i\\\\theta}) ={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} f(\\\\varphi)\\\\cdot {1- r^2\\\\over 1 - 2r\\\\cos (\\\\theta -\\\\varphi) + r^2}\\\\,d\\\\varphi,} for r < 1\\\\. Standard properties of the Poisson integral show that Ff is a harmonic function on z < 1 which extends by continuity to f on z = 1. With the additional assumption that f is orientation-preserving homeomorphism of this circle, Ff is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism of the open unit disk. Proof To prove that Ff is locally an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism, it suffices to show that the Jacobian at a point a in the unit disk is positive. This Jacobian is given by :\\\\displaystyle{J_f(a)=\\\\partial_zF_f(a)^2 - \\\\partial_{\\\\overline{z}} F_f(a)^2.} On the other hand that g is a M√∂bius transformation preserving the unit circle and the unit disk, :\\\\displaystyle{F_{f\\\\circ g}=F_f \\\\circ g.} Taking g so that g(a) = 0 and taking the change of variable Œ∂ = g(z), the chain rule gives :\\\\displaystyle{(F_f\\\\circ g)_z= [(F_f)_\\\\zeta \\\\circ g]\\\\cdot g_z, \\\\,\\\\, (F_f\\\\circ g)_{\\\\overline{z}}=[(F_{f})_{\\\\overline{\\\\zeta}} \\\\circ g] \\\\cdot\\\\overline{g_z}.} It follows that :\\\\displaystyle{J_{f\\\\circ g}(a)= J_f(0)\\\\cdot g_z(a)^2.} It is therefore enough to prove positivity of the Jacobian when a = 0. In that case :\\\\displaystyle{J_f(0)=a_{1}^2 - a_{-1}^2,} where the an are the Fourier coefficients of f: :\\\\displaystyle{a_n={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} f(e^{i\\\\theta}) e^{-in\\\\theta}\\\\, d\\\\theta.} Following , the Jacobian at 0 can be expressed as a double integral :\\\\displaystyle{a_{1}^2 - a_{-1}^2={1\\\\over 4\\\\pi^2}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\Re [f(e^{i\\\\theta})\\\\overline{f(e^{i\\\\varphi})} (e^{i(\\\\theta-\\\\varphi)}-e^{-i(\\\\theta-\\\\varphi)})]\\\\,d\\\\theta\\\\, d\\\\varphi.} Writing :\\\\displaystyle{f(e^{i\\\\theta})=e^{ih(\\\\theta)},} where h is a strictly increasing continuous function satisfying :\\\\displaystyle{h(\\\\theta+2\\\\pi)=h(\\\\theta) +2\\\\pi}, the double integral can be rewritten as :\\\\displaystyle{a_{1}^2 - a_{-1}^2={1\\\\over 2 \\\\pi^2} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\sin (\\\\theta-\\\\varphi) \\\\sin(h(\\\\theta)-h(\\\\varphi))\\\\,d\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\varphi={1\\\\over 2 \\\\pi^2} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\sin (\\\\theta) \\\\sin(h(\\\\theta+\\\\varphi)-h(\\\\varphi))\\\\,d\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\varphi.} Hence :\\\\displaystyle{a_{1}^2 - a_{-1}^2={1\\\\over 2 \\\\pi^2} \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi}\\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\int_0^\\\\pi R(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi)\\\\,d\\\\varphi\\\\,d\\\\theta,} where :R(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi)= \\\\sin(h(\\\\varphi+\\\\theta) - h(\\\\varphi)) + \\\\sin(h(\\\\varphi+2\\\\pi)-h(\\\\varphi+\\\\theta +\\\\pi)) + \\\\sin(h(\\\\varphi+\\\\theta +\\\\pi) -h(\\\\varphi +\\\\pi)) + \\\\sin(h(\\\\varphi+\\\\pi) - h(\\\\varphi+\\\\theta)). This formula gives R as the sum of the sines of four non- negative angles with sum 2œÄ, so it is always non-negative.This elementary fact holds more generally for any number of non-negative angles with sum 2œÄ. If all the angles are less than or equal to œÄ, all the sines are non-negative. If one is greater than œÄ, the result states that the sine of the sum of the other angles is less than the sine of their sum. This follows by induction from the result for two angles, itself a direct consequence of the trigonometric formula for the sine of the sum. But then the Jacobian at 0 is strictly positive and Ff is therefore locally a diffeomorphism. It remains to deduce Ff is a homeomorphism. By continuity its image is compact so closed. The non- vanishing of the Jacobian, implies that Ff is an open mapping on the unit disk, so that the image of the open disk is open. Hence the image of the closed disk is an open and closed subset of the closed disk. By connectivity, it must be the whole disk. For w < 1, the inverse image of w is closed, so compact, and entirely contained in the open disk. Since Ff is locally a homeomorphism, it must be a finite set. The set of points w in the open disk with exactly n preimages is open. By connectivity every point has the same number N of preimages. Since the open disk is simply connected, N = 1. In fact taking any preimage of the origin, every radial line has a unique lifting to a preimage, and so there is an open subset of the unit disk mapping homeomorphically onto the open disk. If N > 1, its complement would also have to be open, contradicting connectivity.

Football career Campbell was born in the Camlachie area of Glasgow and played his youth football with Irvine Meadow in the Scottish Intermediate League. Aged 24, he was spotted by scouts from Southampton and he moved to The Dell club in July 1931. His first-team debut came when he took the place of Bill Adams at right-half in a 2‚Äì1 debut against Tottenham Hotspur on 7 September 1931. He was in and out of the side for the remainder of the 1931‚Äì32 season, sharing the No. 4 shirt with Bert Shelley and Stan Woodhouse, although a fractured thigh put him out for several months mid-season. He soon developed into a \\"strong, forceful half-back\\" and \\"quickly adapted to life in the English Second Division\\". In 1932‚Äì33, he took over at centre-half at the start of the season, with occasional appearances in the forward line, before reverting to right-half, as the \\"Saints\\" continued in relative obscurity in the middle of the Second Division. He was a virtual ever-present in 1933‚Äì34 until March when a knee injury again put him out. His injuries developed into chronic arthritis, which forced him to retire at the start of the 1934‚Äì35 season after making a total of 89 appearances for Southampton, with five goals. Later career On retirement from league football, Campbell worked for the Folland Aircraft company on the Isle of Wight, playing occasional matches for Newport, before moving to Hatfield, Hertfordshire, where he continued to work in the aircraft industry.

The church was known locally as the Kirk of Dunscore; it lies close to Fardingwell Farm and was between Isle Tower and Ellisland of Robert Burns, in the eastern part of the Civil Parish of Dunscore. No identifiable remains of the church can now be seen. The churchyard, consecrated ground, continues to be used for the inhabitants of the local farms, Isle Tower, Friars Carse, etc. History About AD1170 the original place of worship was established by a Norman lord. The land was gifted to the Abbey of Holywood by the Cistercian monks of Melrose. The monks played an important part in developing the area by improving the drainage, growing new crops and by promoting animal husbandry at such places the Friars' Carse grange and elsewhere.Dunscore Church Retrieved : 2012-08-10 In AD1257 the first mention of the church occurs in a monastic dispute, and then again in 1412.

He was president of the American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists and of the American Society for Experimental Pathology. Born the son of banker Samuel N. Wolbach and Rosa Stein, he was raised in a Jewish home in rural Nebraska in the wild west era. He went east to study in Boston and remained there most of his life. He married Anna F. Wellington in 1914 and had three children. Education Harvard Lawrence Scientific School, then Harvard Medical School M.D. 1903 Boston City Hospital postgraduate studies in pathology with Frank Burr Mallory and William T. Councilman 1903-05 Career In 1905, he returned to Harvard Medical School to work in pathology as an assistant under Councilman, while he was also the pathologist to the Boston Lying-In Hospital and the Long Island chronic care hospital. Three years later he became the director of Bender Hygienic Laboratory (today part of St. Peter's Healthcare) in Albany, New York, while an adjunct professor and department head of pathology and bacteriology at Albany Medical College. He spent 1909 at Montreal General Hospital and McGill University, then in 1910 returned to Harvard's Department of Bacteriology under Harold C. Ernst. In 1914 he became an associate professor of pathology and bacteriology there, then in 1922 was made the head of pathology, occupying the chair as Shattuck Professor of Pathological Anatomy. From 1922 to 47 he was at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and Children's Hospital of Boston as chief of pathology. In 1938 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Research Wolbach's early research was into the effects of radiation on skin with Porter. Later field work in Africa got him interested in tropical parasitology. Working with McGill parasitologist John L. Todd, they carried uninfected lice (feeding them on their persons) to Poland in 1920 in order to demonstrate that lice transmit Rickettsia prowazekii, the organism which is the cause of epidemic typhus. For this work he received the rank of Commander in the Order of Polonia Restituta. Wolbach turned his attention to childhood development and vitamin deficiencies. Working with J.M. Coppoletta at Brigham and Children's, he developed tables of the weights of vital organs for different ages and body lengths which became a definitive reference for pediatric pathology.

It is native to the Indo-Pacific region and is commonly used in scientific investigations. Description Stylophora pistillata has broad, blunt-ended branches, and colonies become thicker and more submassive as they grow. The maximum diameter of a colony is about . The corallites (stony cups from which the polyps emerge) are conical or hooded and are sunk beneath the general surface. The columella (central column of the corallite) is solid and prominent, and the septa (stony plates forming the corallite wall) may be fused to the columella. There are six primary septa and sometimes six secondary ones. Colonies can be cream, pink, bluish or green. Distribution Stylophora pistillata is widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from Madagascar, East Africa, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, through the Indian Ocean to northern Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, Japan and many island groups in the western and central Pacific Ocean. It is a reef-building species and favours exposed habitats with strong water movement. Its depth range is down to about . Ecology This coral provides a home to gall crabs, Trapezia crabs, boring clams, date mussels, barnacles, Christmas tree worms and damselfish. Some, such as the date mussels, are parasites that bore into the coral structure and weaken the coral skeleton. However, boring clams bring fresh, oxygenated water into the colony which benefits the coral. Status The chief threats faced by corals in general are climate change, with its associated sea temperature rise and increase in violent storms, and habitat destruction, as well as an increase in ocean acidification and an increasing susceptibility to coral diseases. Stylophora pistillata is prone to coral bleaching, a condition in which corals force out the beneficial zooxanthellae from their tissues and become white and liable to die. However, this is a common species of coral with a wide distribution and may be more resilient than some less widespread coral species. It is collected for the reef aquarium trade, with about 10,000 pieces being exported in 2005. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \\"near threatened\\".

Dive planning is the process of planning an underwater diving operation. The purpose of dive planning is to increase the probability that a dive will be completed safely and the goals achieved. Some form of planning is done for most underwater dives, but the complexity and detail considered may vary enormously. Professional diving operations are usually formally planned and the plan documented as a legal record that due diligence has been done for health and safety purposes. Recreational dive planning may be less formal, but for complex technical dives, can be as formal, detailed and extensive as most professional dive plans. A professional diving contractor will be constrained by the code of practice, standing orders or regulatory legislation covering a project or specific operations within a project, and is responsible for ensuring that the scope of work to be done is within the scope of the rules relevant to that work. A recreational (including technical) diver or dive group is generally less constrained, but nevertheless is almost always restricted by some legislation, and often also the rules of the organisations to which the divers are affiliated. The planning of a diving operation may be simple or complex. In some cases the processes may have to be repeated several times before a satisfactory plan is achieved, and even then the plan may have to be modified on site to suit changed circumstances. The final product of the planning process may be formally documented or, in the case of recreational divers, an agreement on how the dive will be conducted. A diving project may consist of a number of related diving operations. A documented dive plan may contain elements from the following list: *Overview of Diving Activities *Schedule of Diving Operations *Specific Dive Plan Information *Budget Objective Commercial diving contractors will develop specifications for the operation in cooperation with the client, who will normally provide a specific objective. The client will generally specify what work is to be done, and the diving contractor will deal with the logistics of how to do it. Other professional divers will usually plan their diving operations around an objective related to their primary occupation. Recreational divers will generally choose an objective for entertainment value, or for training purposes. It will generally be necessary to specify the following: * Work to be done, or the recreational equivalent * Equipment needed * Procedures to be used * Personnel required * Places * Times Analysis of available information on the site * Expected surface conditions, such as sea state, air temperature, and wind chill factor * Expected underwater conditions, including water temperature, depth, type of bottom, tides and currents, visibility, extent of pollution, and other hazards * Assistance and emergency information, including location, status, and contact procedures for the nearest recompression chamber, evacuation and rescue facilities, and nearest hospital. * Location and accessibility of the site Selection of techniques and mode of diving Detailed planning depends on the mode and techniques selected for the dive, and the choice of these depends to a large extent on the physical constraints of the dive, but also to the legal, financial and procedural constraints of the divers. The mode and techniques chosen must also allow the dive to be done at an acceptable level of risk. There is usually more than one mode which is physically feasible, and often a choice between modes which are otherwise acceptable. In some cases detailed planning may show that the initial choice was not appropriate, and the process has to be repeated for an alternative choice. =Diving without breathing apparatus= Free diving does not involve the use of external breathing devices, but relies on a diver's ability to hold his or her breath until resurfacing. Free diving is limited in depth and time, but for some purposes it may be suitable. =Scuba diving= Diving with a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, which is completely independent of surface supply, provides the diver with the advantages of mobility and horizontal range far beyond what is possible when supplied from the surface by the umbilical hoses of surface-supplied diving equipment. Scuba has limitations of breathing gas supply, communications between diver and surface are problematic, the location of the diver may be difficult to monitor, and it is considered a higher-risk mode of diving in most circumstances. Scuba is specifically forbidden for some professional applications. Decompression is often avoided, and if necessary, is generally in-water, but may use a variety of gases. Open circuit Open-circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure connected to a primary diving regulator, and may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency breathing gas. Rebreathers Closed- circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. This reduces the volume of gas used, so that a smaller cylinder, or cylinders, than open-circuit scuba may be used for the equivalent dive duration, and giving the ability to spend far more time underwater compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers also produce far less bubble volume and less noise than scuba, which makes them attractive to military, scientific and media divers. They also have a larger number of critical failure modes, are more expensive and require more training to use at a reasonable level of safety. =Surface supplied diving= Surface supplied diving using a diving stage Breathing gases may be supplied from the surface through a diver's umbilical, or airline hose, which provides breathing gas, communications and a safety line, with options for a hot water hose for heating, a video cable and gas reclaim line. The diver's breathing gas supply is significantly more secure than for scuba; communications are simplified and the divers position is either known or can be traced reliably by following the umbilical. Several major risks are thereby mitigated, but the system also has serious disadvantages in some applications, as diver mobility is constrained by the length of the umbilical, and it may snag on obstructions. Surface- oriented, or bounce diving, is how commercial divers refer to diving operations where the diver starts and finishes the diving operation at atmospheric pressure. The alternative, while retaining surface supply, is saturation diving. For bounce dives, the diver may be deployed directly, often from a diving support vessel or indirectly via a diving bell. Decompression procedures include in-water decompression or surface decompression in a deck chamber. Small closed bell systems which include a two-man bell, a launch and recovery frame and a chamber for decompression after transfer under pressure (TUP) are reasonably mobile, and suited to deep bounce dives. =Saturation diving= Diver Transfer Capsule suitable for saturation diving Saturation diving lets divers live and work at depth for days or weeks at a time. After working in the water, divers are transferred in a closed diving bell to rest and live in a dry pressurized underwater habitat on the bottom or a saturation life support system of pressure chambers at the surface. Decompression at the end of the dive may take many days, but since it is done only once for a long period of exposure, rather than after each of many shorter exposures, the overall risk of decompression injury to the diver and the total time spent decompressing are reduced. This type of diving allows greater economy of work and enhanced safety, but the capital and running costs are high and the systems are expensive to transport. Mobility of the diver is restricted because of the umbilical. =Atmospheric diving suits= Diver in atmospheric diving suit on launch and recovery platform Atmospheric diving suits can be used for very deep dives of up to for many hours, and eliminate several physiological dangers associated with deep diving: the occupant need not decompress; there is no need for special gas mixtures; and there is no danger of decompression sickness or nitrogen narcosis. Disadvantages include high cost, limited availability, bulk and limited diver dexterity. Diving team selection The diving team personnel selection will depend largely on the diving mode selected and organisational requirements. Professional dive team members will generally be selected on documented evidence of proven competence or qualification for the tasks allocated. Professional diving teams will usually include (the precise terminology may vary between organisations): * A supervisor * One or more working divers * One or more stand-by divers * One or more diver's attendants * Other surface support personnel, which may include:  Medical support (not necessarily on-site)  Chamber operator or life support technician  Support vessel crew  Equipment technicians, gas panel operators, timekeepers, riggers Technical teams will also generally base appointments on proven competence, certification or personal trust. Technical diving groups vary in complexity, but will generally comprise: * Dive team * In-water support team * Surface support team Recreational groupings may be based on personal experience and trust, but are frequently relatively arbitrary allocations by the service provider, based on certification. Recreational diving groups commonly comprise a buddy pair of divers, but may also be a solo diver or a group of divers who will be led by a divemaster. Selection may be by mutual agreement to dive together, or may simply be the result of booking on the same dive. Depth and time Depth is often one of the more straightforward parameters, as it is often fixed by the topography of the site. Time is influenced by limitations of equipment and decompression constraints, as well as the actual time required to perform the intended task, which in turn is influenced by the underwater environment in general, and specific to the site. Environmental factors The specific diving environment must be taken into account during dive planning. The environment at the dive site will determine several factors which may require specific planning, such as the depth, water salinity and altitude which affect decompression planning, an overhead environment affects navigation and gas planning, water temperature and contaminants affect the choice of exposure and environmental protection, site topography affects choice of entry and exit points. Hazards of the proposed diving operation Divers face specific physical and health risks when they go underwater with diving equipment, or use high pressure breathing gas. A hazard is any biological, chemical, physical, mechanical or environmental agent or situation that poses a level of threat to life, health, property, or environment. The presence of a combination of several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Diving hazards may be classified under several groups: * The aquatic environment itself * Use of breathing equipment underwater * Exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes  Pressure changes during descent  Pressure changes during ascent  Breathing gases at high ambient pressure * The specific diving environment * Pre- existing physiological and psychological conditions in the diver * Diver behaviour and competence * Failure of diving equipment other than breathing apparatus * Hazards of the dive task and special equipment =Risk assessment= The assessed risk of a dive would generally be considered unacceptable if the diver is not expected to cope with any single reasonably foreseeable incident with a significant probability of occurrence during that dive. Professional diving organisations tend to be less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, who are less constrained by occupational health and safety legislation. Dive profile The planned dive profile is an important input parameter for gas planning and decompression planning, and is generally based on the time required to perform the task of each specific dive, and the depth at which the task will be performed, in combination with environmental considerations and the breathing gas mixtures chosen. Limits are often due to exposure to cold, work load, decompression time, safety constraints and logistics of breathing gas supply. Route For some dives the route to be followed and navigation procedures to follow the planned route may be important, either for achieving the objective, for safety, or for both. There may be known hazards that can be avoided by following a specific route or constraining the possible extent of diver excursion. In all penetration dives the route may be critical for safety. The diver must be assured of getting out from the overhead zone before running out of gas. The standard method is to follow a guideline into and out of the overhead environment, and laying the line or laying and recovering the line may be part of the dive plan. In explorations and surveys the route may be unknown or uncertain, and contingency plans must be known to the divers so that the dive plan can be altered to suit the situation as it unfolds. Professional divers may follow a planned route to the worksite which prevents the diver from close approach to known hazards. This may involve limiting umbilical length and manned or unmanned underwater tending points, downlines and jackstays Choice of equipment Diving equipment in storage Equipment will be chosen based on several constraints, including: *Legal and procedural requirements of the organisation *Availability of equipment *Diver skills and certification *Suitability for the purpose *Risk and benefit considerations Equipment and supplies selection would normally include: * Diving equipment * Breathing gas, including a backup supply * Tools or equipment for the task if appropriate * Dive platform and support equipment, including diver/crew shelter * Oxygen resuscitator and first aid kit * Dive flag * Communications equipment A recreational diver may expect many of these items to be arranged by the service provider (the dive boat operator, shop, or school providing thansport to the dive site and organising the dive). Decompression planning Decompression tables for recreational dive planning Decompression is planned based on the intended dive profile, the chosen gas mixtures, and the chosen decompression tables or algorithms. There are two basic approaches to decompression for surface oriented dives, and one for saturation diving. *Real time computation of tissue gas levels and the appropriate decompression schedule may be monitored by personal decompression computers worn by the diver. This system is popular with recreational, technical and scientific scuba divers. Any deviation from the planned profile is automatically taken into account, and the diver can keep track at all times of the current total time required for ascent. The surface team is not aware of the decompression status of a diver unless there is voice communication and the diver reports the information. *Decompression schedules are drawn up for the planned dive profile before the dive from tables or a program. Contingency schedules are usually prepared for scuba divers, which allow for all the reasonably probable deviations from the planned schedule, and usually allow for variations in depth and time. These schedules are carried by the diver and used to manage the ascent profile and decompression. Surface supplied divers are monitored by the surface team, and if they deviate from plan the supervisor can change the schedule to suit. *Saturation diving will decompress the divers only at the end of the diving contract, in the controlled and relatively comfortable environment of the saturation system. The schedule will depend on the pressure and breathing gas mixture, not on the duration of exposure. The procedures chosen will to a large extent depend on the mode of diving and equipment available. Gas planning Gas planning for diving operations where divers use open circuit equipment with breathing gas mixtures is more complex than operations where atmospheric air is supplied via low pressure compressor from the surface, or the breathing gas is reclaimed, processed and re-used. =Scuba gas planning= Gas blending equipment Scuba gas planning is the aspect of dive planning which deals with the calculation or estimation of the amounts and mixtures of gases to be used for a planned dive profile, and can be critical to the safety of the dive. The scuba diver by definition is independent of surface supply and, in general, must carry all gas needed for the dive, though in limited circumstances depots of drop cylinders may be placed along the route of the dive for use on the return. This requires the route to be marked and the divers to return along the marked route, and is particularly suited to penetration dives, such as wreck and cave dives. Deep dives with open water ascents can also occasionally make use of surface standby divers who can provide contingency gas to ascending divers whose position is marked by a shotline or decompression buoys. The calculations assume that the dive profile, including decompression, is known, but the process may be iterative, involving changes to the dive profile as a consequence of the gas requirement calculation, or changes to the gas mixtures chosen. Scuba gas planning includes the following aspects: * Choice of breathing gases to limit decompression requirements to limit inert gas narcosis to limit work of breathing * Choice of Scuba configuration * Estimation of gas quantities required for the planned dive, including bottom gas, travel gas, and decompression gases, as appropriate to the profile. * Estimation of gas quantities for reasonably foreseeable contingencies. * Choice of cylinders to carry the required gases. Each cylinder volume and working pressure must be sufficient to contain the required quantity of gas. * Calculation of the pressures for each of the gases in each of the cylinders to provide the required quantities. * Specifying the critical pressures of relevant gas mixtures for appropriate stages (waypoints) of the planned dive profile. =Surface supplied gas planning= Open circuit surface supplied diving mostly uses air as the breathing gas, though mixed gases may also be used. Surface supplied air is generally supplied by low pressure compressor, and the continuous supply is limited only by the compressor continuing to run effectively, and to provide air of suitable quality. There is also a reserve air supply, either from a second compressor, or from fairly large high pressure cylinders. Each diver also carries a scuba bailout cylinder, which should carry sufficient gas to safely surface from any point in the planned dive. Running out of air is a relatively low risk with these facilities, and gas planning centres on ensuring that the primary and, if present, backup compressors are correctly sized to provide the necessary pressure and flow rates. These are specified by the breathing equipment manufacturer based on depth and workload, and by the compressor manufacturer for the standard running speed of the machine. Reserve surface supply cylinder contents are based on the gas requirement for safe ascent from any part of the dive, allowing for reasonably foreseeable delays, and for a rescue by the standby diver. The diver's bailout cylinder should contain adequate gas in case of an emergency at the planned depth. Critical pressure should be calculated based on the planned profile and must allow change-over, ascent and all planned decompression. In some jurisdictions the stand-by diver must be supplied from an air source which is independent of that supplying the working divers, as the cause of an emergency may be failure or contamination of the main air supply to the working diver. Low pressure compressor delivery Compressors are rated according to the volume of air taken in each minute. This is also the free gas volume that will be supplied to the divers. The volume of air used by the divers will depend on work rate and depth. Short term variations are compensated by the air receiver on the compressor. The delivery volume at maximum ambient pressure for the planned dive must be sufficient for all the divers to be supplied from the compressor. The supply pressure must be in excess of minimum functional pressure for the regulator to be enough to get air to the diver. In practice a delivery pressure of about 20 bar is commonly used. The manufacturer of the helmet or full-face mask will specify a pressure range which will deliver sufficient air for a given dive depth, which is usually from 6 to 10 bar more than the ambient pressure due to depth. Free flow helmets Free flow helmets generally require a considerably higher compressor delivery than demand helmets, as the flow is continuous, and should never drop below peak inhalation rate of the diver. Flow rates up to 1500 litres per minute surface equivalent are quoted for the Divex AH-5 helmet at 50 metres sea water for heavy work. Delivery pressure at the AH-5 helmet is recommended at 3.5 bar above ambient. =Saturation gas planning= Saturation systems frequently use gas reclaim equipment to minimize the loss of expensive helium, and this makes the gas usage relatively independent of dive duration and depth, however reserves must be available in case of loss or leakage. Scrubber systems are used to remove carbon dioxide from the breathing gas, and other filters to remove odours and other contaminants. Booster pump systems are used to return gas to high pressure storage. Contingency plans Contingency planning covers what to do if something happenes that is not according to the planned operation. The hazard identification and risk assessment will suggest the range of foreseeable contingencies, and the specifics of how much to organise to deal with them will depend on the consequences. In general, contingencies that have serious health and safety consequences should have plans in place to deal with them, while those which are merely an inconvenience may be accepted if they occur. Some contingency classes are listed here: *Environmental condition changes Weather and sea state *Equipment malfunctions *Incorrect information Position of site Accessibility Environmental conditions Unexpected hazards Extent of work, equipment required Plans for technical contingencies may include arrangements for alternative equipment, spares, alternative boat etc. The level of contingency planning will depend on the project, and the importance of the task. Plans for adverse conditions may include arrangements for alternative dates, or in some cases alternative venues. Emergency plans In general, there should be plans to deal with reasonably foreseeable emergencies that pose a risk to health and safety wherever there is a duty of care, these may include where relevant: *First Aid for medical emergencies *Search and recovery *Casualty evacuation *Site evacuation *Hazmat emergencies Some of the action generally taken to prepare for possible medical emergencies will include: *Appropriate first aid equipment available on site *Adequate oxygen administration equipment available on site *A plan for evacuation of a casualty to a hyperbaric chamber *A list of contact numbers, call codes and frequencies for local emergency services. *How to reach the nearest suitable emergency medical facility from the site. Permits and permission It may be necessary to arrange for clearance to dive. Permits or permission for access or to dive at the site may be required, and making the arrangements can be considered part of dive planning. This may include, but is not limited to: *Permits to dive in a Marine Protected Area *Permits to collect specimens at a specific site or in general. *Permits to use specific collecting methods. *Permits to operate specific equipment. *Permits to dive on an archaeological site. *Permits to perform salvage work. *Permits to perform blasting work. *Permits or permission to launch or recover a vessel at a specific place. *Permits to operate a vessel in restricted areas. *Permission from harbourmaster to dive within harbour limits. *Permission from port control to dive in shipping lanes. *Permission from landowners to access the water, and to dive in inland waters. *Permission from utilities companies to dive in reservoirs. *Clearance from vessel operators or installation operators that the site is safe to dive. *Clearance that contamination is acceptable for the diving equipment to be used. This may require a water sample to be tested before the dive. Schedule of operational tasks * Travel to the site * Preparation of diving and support equipment * Predive briefing * Actual diving operations * Recovery, cleaning, inspection, repair, and storage of gear * Debriefing Budget Estimating the cost of a diving operation is an important component of the planning process, and is dependent on almost all the factors described above.

It is found in shallow waters in the Western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Description Neofibularia nolitangere is a massive sponge often growing to about wide and 30 centimetres tall but sometimes reaching in width. It has a central cavity or atrium with thick walls. It takes various forms in different areas of the Caribbean. In the Bahamas it usually occurs as a number of rounded lobes with a cup-shaped depression or cloaca on the apex of each. In these are several openings called osculi that slope diagonally to join the atrium and out of which water is propelled. Sometimes the sponge is encrusting, forming a shallow layer of tissue growing across the substrate. In other locations it grows as several concentric mounds with smaller cloacal openings or as large vase-type structures, single or in groups, sometimes fused together laterally. The general colour is deep brown or dark red. The inside surfaces of the cloaca are rougher than the outer surface of the sponge which is smooth but not shiny. The consistency of this sponge is compressible, fragile and crumbly, but handling it is unwise as it causes a smarting sensation and numbness of the skin. Repeated exposure to it can cause a more severe allergic reaction. Distribution Neofibularia nolitangere is found in the Western Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea. Its range extends from Florida and the Bahamas to the Greater and Lesser Antilles and south to Panama, Colombia and Venezuela. The depth range is . Biology Like other sponges, Neofibularia nolitangere is a filter feeder. Water is drawn in through small pores in the walls called ostia. These are lined by flagellated cells called choanocytes which move the water along. The bacteria-size food particles are engulfed by the choanocytes and slightly larger particles are captured by the narrow collars found where the ostia enter the atrium. The water exits through the oscula on the top surface of the sponge. Neofibularia nolitangere has been observed to \\"smoke\\" as it releases a large number of sperm from the oscula. It is presumed from this that it reproduces sexually but little is known of its reproductive biology. Ecology Parasitic polychaete worms, Haplosyllis spongicola, are frequently seen as small white shapes protruding from the inner cloaca walls. There may be tens of thousands of worms living in an individual sponge and they are sometimes so abundant that they make up five percent of its weight. Several species of fish are associated with this sponge. These include the gobies Elacatinus horsti and Elacatinus chancei which live inside its apertures and largely feed on the worm.

Career  Storaas grew out of the flowering musical environment in Bergen late 70es, early 80es, and was well known for his innovative bass playing on the local rock and jazz scene. He started studies on the University of Bergen (political science and music). He attended Berklee College of Music, Boston, in 1984, and got his diploma in Arranging in 1986. Returned to Norway, (Oslo) and did all kinds of writing work. Arranging for shows, broadcasting, recording sessions, composing for commercials, commissioned films, TV idents, etc. Also found some time for music of his own, and won the Danish Radio Orchestra competition for younger composers in 1989, with the work \\"Ouverture #2\\". Best known is probably all the ident music for the launch of TV2, the biggest commercial TV channel in Norway, in 1992. The last decade, time has been split between composing for film and TV, and orchestral arranging for many of the most popular Norwegian artists.

They were members of a group of five airmen of the 20th Bomb Squadron who stayed with pilot Warren Woodruff when he landed their plane in a field. They had voluntarily surrendered and were taken away in a truck, accompanied by Strasser, and by Captain Karl Lindemeyer, the chief of police of the city. During Strasser's trial evidence was presented that it was Lindemeyer who killed the other three, and the court verdict suggests that the killings were originally Lindemeyer's idea. Lindemeyer committed suicide while in custody.United States v. Franz Strasser, an Austrian national, Case No. 8-27, 14 October 1945 at Jewish Virtual Library (pdf) Trial and execution On 24 August 1945, Strasser was tried in an Allied military court, which had provided a translator for him during the trial.

The original church opened in 1869, and for 34 years to 1903 served as Pro- Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Westminster. That building was destroyed by bombing in 1940: its successor, which survives, opened in 1959. The church stands at 235a Kensington High Street, Kensington, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. History =Re-establishment of public Catholic worship in England= English resumption of regular, public Catholic services commenced in 1794 after a break of nearly 250 years (with main exceptions being for the entourages of courtiers of the consorts of Charles I and Charles II, chapels with use ceded for foreign ambassadorial missions and two chapels under deposed King James II), as French aristocrats, priests and nuns fled the French Revolution and found a welcome in Kensington, since when the parish has had continuous worship and services.\\"History\\", Our Lady of Victories, Kensington Mass in the subjugated period of English Catholicism was said in Catholic embassies or private houses. From 1852 to 1869 St Mary's Church, Moorfields, built by the faith served as the first diocesan seat of a re- established British Catholic church with hierarchy. In 1866 the Carmelites opened the first Catholic church in Kensington. The original parish church of Our Lady of Victories was designed by noted architect George Goldie. His grandson, Joseph Goldie would later design the entrance screen. The church opened on 2 July 1869, the Feast of the Visitation, taking over the congregation of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Chapel, Holland Street. It became the Pro-Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Westminster. (Westminster Cathedral opened in 1903.) =Notable events= At Queen Victoria's 50th Jubilee in 1887 High Mass was celebrated in the presence of Cardinal Manning, sung by the Papal Envoy and attended by all the Hierarchy and leading Catholics in England. The following year, the jubilee of 50 years of priesthood of Pope Leo XIII was the occasion of another glittering assembly in the church, during which \\"God Bless Our Pope\\", composed by the curate of Our Lady of Victories, Fr Charles Cox, was sung for the first time in public. Our Lady of Victories School started in the late 1800s when the parish priest of Our Lady of Victories set up a \\"Poor School\\" in a hall in the grounds of the Assumption Convent in Kensington Square.\\"The History of the School\\", Our Lady of Victories Catholic Primary School Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School is a secondary school located in the parish.\\"Our Lady of Victories\\", Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea =Destruction and rebuilding= On the night of 13 September 1940, four German incendiary bombs landed on the roof of the church. In 2¬Ω hours the church was devastated and burned to the ground. The Blessed Sacrament was saved and taken by the priests to the nearby Carmelite Church. Re-building was not permitted until after the end of the war, so the parish was without a church for a length of time. Daily Mass and all services were maintained without a break, first in the local Odeon cinema, and then in the premises of Cavendish Furnishings ‚Äì known as \\"St Cavendish's\\" by parishioners ‚Äì in the Convent of the Assumption in Kensington Square (where still many parish outreach and activities take place today), in the hall at the back of the burnt out church and finally in the local Congregational Church, Allan Street, leased to the parish with great goodwill. A succession of parish priests ‚Äì Canon Bagshawe, Mgr Kelleher and Fr Drumm ‚Äì worked to raise funds for a new church. In 1952 the architect Adrian Gilbert Scott was commissioned by Canon Bagshawe to design a new church. On 16 April 1959 the rebuilt church of Our Lady of Victories, was opened as the Parish Church of Kensington by Cardinal Archbishop William Godfrey. The Consecration of the Church and Altar was performed by Bishop Derek Worlock, formerly curate in Kensington and later Archbishop of Liverpool, on the 26 May 1971 in the presence of Cardinal Heenan. Building The present re-built church was built in 1957, to designs by Adrian Gilbert Scott, incorporating a 1930s entrance screen by Joseph Goldie. It has been a Grade II listed building since 2016. A War Damage Commission grant enabled the creation of a set of stained glass windows by C. F. Blakeman. In the 1980s Fr Walter Drumm moved the large Bavarian crucifix above the sanctuary to the western aisle, where it serves as the twelfth Station of the Cross, and installed above the sanctuary a bronzed sculpture of the Risen Christ by Michael Clark, whose father, Lindsay, had sculpted the statue of Our Lady, help of Christians above the entrance arch on the High Street. Today the sculpture by Clark has been relocated and the empty space is waiting to be filled by a new piece. New facilities, such as in the basement and adornments are ongoing. In the 2010s projects (overseen by the incumbent Jim Curry and the building committee) included upgrade of disabled access and renovation of the large community facilities beneath the church.

History The squadron was first organized as the 3200th Target & Drone Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base in July 1951.See Mueller, p. 139 It assumed the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress drone aerial target mission that had been performed by elements of the 550th Guided Missiles Wing until December 1950. The squadron operated QB-17 drones and DB-17 controller aircraft, providing aerial targets for surface-to-air missile and air-to-air missile development programs at Eglin. The unit also used Lockheed QF-80 Shooting Star jets as aerial gunnery targets for Air Defense Command interceptor squadrons. The squadron deployed elements to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Nevada Test Site and Pacific Proving Grounds throughout the 1950s, flying drone Flying Fortresses though atomic and nuclear testing mushroom clouds with air sampling equipment and other instrumentation for post-detonation analysis.Thompson In April 1956, with the development of the IM-99 Bomarc surface-to-air missile, the squadron moved its B-17 operations from Eglin to Patrick Air Force Base, Florida to support the Bomarc testing program. From Patrick, DB and QB-17s could take off and missiles could be test fired from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 3 over the Atlantic Missile Range. One such trial on 23 October 1957 (Bomarc 624-11) saw the unarmed missile destroy a Flying Fortress target by a direct collision, more than 100 miles from the missile's launch point.Jablonski The squadron discontinued its B-17 operations at Patrick, on 5 December 1958, but they were continued by the 3205th Drone Group, Detachment 1, which flew drone targets for Bomarc tests well into 1959. Once the IM-99A testing portion of the program was completed, drones were no longer required. The personnel of Detachment 1 departed for Eglin on 8 June 1959.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of four local parishes to form the Benefice of Hawkshead with Low Wray and Sawrey and Rusland and Satterthwaite. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. Hyde and Pevsner, in the Buildings of England series, describe it as being \\"one of the best Lake District churches\\". History A chapel existed on the site in the 12th century, which was extended to the length of the present church in about 1300. The north and south aisles were added in 1500. In 1578 its status was raised from being a chapelry that of a parish; credit for this has been given to Edwin Sandys, who was born in the village, and who became Archbishop of York. The roof of the nave was raised in 1585, and the clerestory was created. In about 1793 a vestry and hearse house were built. In 1680 James Addison, from the village of Hornby in the Lune Valley, was commissioned to clean the interior walls of the church, to paint 26 biblical texts with decorative borders, and to paint borders round the pillars and arcades. These were repainted in 1711‚Äì12 by William Mackerath, who added a list of churchwardens, and a text in local dialect near the pulpit. These were restored in 1875 by William Bolton. Between 1875 and the end of the century, rendering was removed from the exterior of the church, and battlements and pinnacles were added to the tower. A south porch was added in 1935. In 1965 a new organ was installed, which allowed the creation of a chapel dedicated to St James. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in rubble stone with a slate roof. Its plan consists of a nave and chancel without any division, north and south aisles and chapels, a northwest vestry, a south porch, and a west tower. On the west side of the tower is a doorway with a two-light window above. On the south side is a small window and a clock face. The bell openings are louvred with straight heads, and the parapet is embattled with corner pinnacles. The vestry has three-light mullioned windows, and along the side of the north aisle are similar windows. The north (Sandys) chapel has a three-light east window, a five-light north window and a doorway above which are the Sandys arms and the date 1578. On each side of the clerestory are four three-light windows. The east window of the chancel has five lights containing Perpendicular tracery. Along the side of the south aisle are three windows of two and three lights. On the side of the south chapel are a doorway converted into a window, and a two-light window; its east window has three lights. =Interior= The interior of the church is thickly whitewashed. The five-bay arcades consist of segmental arches carried on round piers, without capitals or bases. The wall paintings are still present. In the north chapel is the chest tomb dated 1578 of the parents of Archbishop Sandys, with recumbent effigies. On the west wall of the church are elaborate monuments moved from St Dionis Backchurch, London, when it was demolished in 1878. The stained glass in the east window dated 1894 is by Hardman, and in the windows on the south side of the church, dating from between 1884 and 1901, are by H. W. Lonsdale. The two-manual pipe organ by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool was installed in 1965, replacing an earlier organ. There is a ring of eight bells. Five of these were cast in 1765 by James Harrison I, one dating from 1810 is possibly by John Stevenson, and the other two were cast by John Taylor in 1958. External features In the churchyard is a sundial carrying a plate dated 1693, which is listed at Grade II.

Mumma (2 June 1906 ‚Äì 15 July 1997) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy who played a pivotal role in the development of nuclear propulsion for warships. During World War II, he served in France and Germany with the Alsos Mission. A 1926 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Mumma served on a number of warships. He studied marine engineering at the L'√âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure de Maritime in Paris, where he learned the latest techniques of maritime construction. During World War II he served at the David Taylor Model Basin, where he investigated problems of propeller design. In January 1943, he took over the Propeller desk at the Bureau of Ships. He joined the Alsos Mission in 1944, and in the last days of the war was part of a 75-man task force that captured the city of Kiel, including the whole garrison of 150,000 men. After the war he returned to the Bureau of Ships, where he was involved with the development of nuclear propulsion. Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary. However, his most important task was converting the shipyard over to the construction of nuclear submarines. In 1955 he became chief of the Bureau of Ships, where he championed the adoption of the teardrop hull, and oversaw the design of nuclear submarines, cruisers and aircraft carriers. Early life Albert Girard Mumma was born in Findlay, Ohio, on 2 June 1906. His father was a U.S. Army officer, Morton C. Mumma, who had graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point with the class of 1900. He would eventually retire with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1928, and be advanced to colonel on the retired list in 1930. The family lived on a series of Army posts in the United States and overseas. After going on board the destroyer in the Philippines when he was nine years old, Mumma decided to become a naval officer. He graduated from Iowa City High School in 1922. Albert entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in July 1922 with an appointment from Iowa Congressman Harry E. Hull. His two brothers also graduated from Annapolis. His older brother, Morton C. Mumma, Jr., graduated with the class of 1925, served with submarines and PT boats during World War II, and eventually rose to the rank of rear admiral. His younger brother George graduated with the class of 1934, but resigned later that year, and later became a major in the army during World War II. In addition, his nephew, Morton C. Mumma III, graduated with the class of 1948, and joined the air force, from which he retired as a colonel in 1978. Mumma's class at Annapolis was the first for which the traditional midshipmen's cruises were replaced with aviator training for half the class, but Mumma was in the half that still went on the cruises. He sailed to Europe on the battleships and , and sailed from Annapolis to Bremerton, Washington, and back in the battleship . He undertook aviation training immediately after graduation. He graduated 18th out of 456 in the class of 1926, and received an award for having the highest standing in engineering and aeronautics. He was commissioned as an ensign on graduation on 3 June 1926, and after he finished his aviation training, he reported to the cruiser . This took him down to Guantanamo Bay, where he joined the crew of the cruiser . Returning to Iowa City for Thanksgiving, he had a blind date with Carmen Braley, whom he took to the Army-Navy Game in Chicago. They became engaged in July 1925, and were married on 1 October 1927. They had three sons: Albert Girard Mumma, Jr., John Stanton Mumma and David Braley Mumma. His next assignment was to the aircraft carrier , which was being fitted out. He was sent for flight training, but washed out due to having less than perfect eyesight. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) on 3 June 1929. After four years with Saratoga, he was assigned to the destroyer as its gunnery officer. He left the Waters in 1932 to attend the Naval Postgraduate School, which was then located at Annapolis. In 1934, he was offered an opportunity to complete his studies in Paris, although he had not studied French at the Academy. He enrolled in French at the University of Nancy in July. Immersing in the language, Mumma and his family spoke French only. He studied marine engineering at the L'√âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure de Maritime in Paris. Instead of just becoming a maritime engineer, he learned the latest techniques of maritime construction. Before leaving Europe, he was informed that he had been selected for promotion to lieutenant, but he still had to pass the examinations. He reported to his next ship, which was the cruiser , as assistant engineer, at Long Beach, California, where he took his examinations, and was promoted on 29 June 1936. After less than a year, he was sent to the new destroyer on the request of its skipper, Commander Hewlett Thebaud. World War II In 1939, Mumma was posted to the David Taylor Model Basin, where he was promoted to lieutenant commander on 26 June 1940 and commander on 15 August 1942. There he conducted research into the design of propellers and drive shafts. He examined a problem with the skegs on the keels of the and South Dakota-class battleships with harmonic vibrations, which was resolved with re-designed propellers. Similar problems with \\"singing\\" propellers affected the s. In January 1943, he took over the Propeller desk at the Bureau of Ships, with the rank of captain from 1 August 1943. Propeller design was a critical part of all ships, and special propellers were designed and tested for PT boats and submarines. In early 1944, he visited Britain to look at problems with vibration in the new s. Once again, the solution lay in propeller design. On returning to the United States, he met with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project. Mumma became one of four naval officers assigned to the Alsos Mission, the others being Jacob Pieter Den Hartog, Wendell Roop and Henry A. \\"Packy\\" Schade. The naval section of Alsos would investigate German naval technologies, but the main objective of the Alsos Mission was to learn all it could about the German nuclear energy project. All members of the mission had ultra secret security clearances, but none had been involved with the development of the atomic bomb. The naval section of Alsos flew into Paris soon after it had been liberated in August 1944. They went down to Bordeaux to inspect the captured German destroyer Z39. After the Alsos Mission became convinced that the Germans had not developed an atomic bomb, the naval section became the Naval Technical Mission Europe. They were particularly interested in the work of Dr Hellmuth Walter in the development of submarines and rockets. Most of the targets that they were interested in lay in the British sector, so they worked closely with their English allies. In the last days of the war, the Naval Technical Mission was part of a 75-man task force, most of whom were from 30 Assault Unit, that made a dash for Kiel, entering the city far in advance of the Allied advance. The whole garrison of the city, some 150,000 men, surrendered to the task force. They drove to Admiral Karl D√∂nitz's headquarters in Flensburg, where they saw but did not speak with him, as D√∂nitz was on his way to surrender. They spoke instead to Admiral Otto Backenk√∂hler, and persuaded him to sign a release for German scientists, so men like Walter could freely discuss their work with the Allies. From April to December 1945, Mumma also served as assistant naval attach√©. Post war Mumma arrived back in the United States in December 1945, and returned to the Bureau of Ships. The Bureau's immediate post war priority was to develop nuclear propulsion for ships. With the Chief of the Bureau, Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, and Captain Paul F. Lee, he went to see Groves and Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, who were willing to help, but would not offer any fissionable material. The Navy decided to proceed with the design of a nuclear-powered ship. They visited Oak Ridge, and attended lectures of nuclear physics from George Gamow and Lawrence R. Hafstad. Mumma selected four outstanding young officers and a physicist, Everett Blizzard, to go to Oak Ridge and learn about reactor design. Mills decided that a senior officer should be sent as well, and added Hyman Rickover to the group, something that Mumma warned Mills that he would regret. In 1949, Mumma became production officer at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, the shipyard became very busy, as ships such as the s were retrieved from being laid up, refurbished and recommissioned. In 1951, he became commander of the David Taylor Model basin. He supervised the conversion of the submarine to incorporate a teardrop hull, and successfully pressed for a single-screw design against entrenched prejudice. Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He became responsible for celebrating the 100th anniversary of its founding by David Farragut in 1854. However, his most important task was converting the shipyard over to the construction of nuclear submarines. This involved extensive retraining of the shipyard's personnel. His tour of command was a short one, for in 1955 he became chief of the Bureau of Ships. Disappointed with the performance of the and the s, he pushed for the adoption of the single screw and teardrop hull. The result was the . The s that followed were a development of the Skipjack with Polaris missiles. He also oversaw the design of the , the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, and its escorts and . Later life Mumma retired from the navy in 1959 and took a job as vice president of engineering at Worthington Corporation. He was elected to the board of directors in 1962, and became executive vice president in 1964, president in April 1967, and chairman of the board in November 1967. He retired at the age of 65 in July 1971. That year President Richard Nixon appointed him to head the American Shipbuilding Commission, which was charged with reporting on ways of improving shipbuilding in the United States. In retirement, he held a number of directorships, on the boards of companies including Prudential Insurance, New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance, the First State Bank, United Hospitals of Newark, Coyful and Esser, C. R. Bard, the Newark Chamber of Commerce, and the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. He was a member of the National Research Council, and served as President of the American Society of Naval Engineers and the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, which awarded him its Admiral Jerry Land Gold Medal, and was a trustee of the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture, Drew University and Saint Barnabas Hospital. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree by the Newark College of Engineering, and was created a Grand Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau by the Queen of the Netherlands. He died in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, on 15 July 1997, and was interred at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery.

It was built in 1974 and destroyed by a fire in August 2012. As the Vercors, the ship laid cables on and between all continents except Antarctica, including numerous trans-Atlantic cables and the first ever Israeli-made cable, and set the record for the deepest submarine buried cable lay in 2000. The ship was badly damaged by a fire in August 2012. History =Service= The Vercors was built in 1974 by the Soci√©t√© Nouvelle des Ateliers et Chantiers du Havre. It started operation out of La Seyne-sur-Mer in 1975. In the 1970s it laid cables to and from France, including the now-decommissioned ANNIBAL, except ANTINEA, which stretched from Morocco to the Ivory Coast through Senegal. In the 1980s the Vercors laid the ATLANTIS between Portugal and Senegal, TAT-7 and TAT-8, and others across most continents. In 1991 it deployed EMOS-1, the first Israeli-made submarine communications cable. Other projects in the 1990s included TASMAN 2 (1992; Australia ‚Äì New Zealand), TAT-9 (1992; Trans- Atlantic), PacRimEast (1993; Hawaii ‚Äì New Zealand), SEA ME WE 2 (1994; Southeast Asia ‚Äì Middle East ‚Äì Western Europe), Columbus II (1994; Trans- Atlantic), TAT-12 and TAT-13 (1995), SEA ME WE 3 (1995), ARIANE-2 (1995; France‚ÄìGreece), ITUR (1996; Italy‚ÄìTurkey‚ÄìUkraine), KAFOS (1996; Turkey‚ÄìBulgaria), TAGIDE-2 (1996; France‚ÄìPortugal), ALETAR (1997; Egypt‚ÄìSyria), BERYTAR (1997; Lebanon‚ÄìSyria) and others. In 2000, it set the world record for the deepest undersea buried communications cable while laying the Southern Cross Cable, at a depth of . It was also involved in TAT-14 and the East Asia Crossing projects in the early 2000s. After it was renamed to the Chamarel in 2002 and transferred to France Telecom Marine, it was assigned to maintenance on the SAT-3/WASC cable system and operated from Cape Town, South Africa. =Fire= The Chamarel caught fire off the shore of the Skeleton Coast, close to Walvis Bay, in Namibia on August 8, 2012, following a mission to repair the SAT-3/WASC cable system. It had a crew of 51 to 56 on board, which evacuated to the fishing vessel Moni. Six of them were lightly wounded and none died. The research ship Nathaniel Maxuilili helped put out the fire, which raged until August 9, before a salvage team was sent to retrieve the Chamarel. Technical specifications The CS Chamarel was long and wide. It had a gross tonnage of 8,575 and deadweight tonnage of 5,900 tons. Its maximum speed was and the average speed was .

It was previously classified as Syllis spongicola and is part of a species complex of closely related species that are difficult to distinguish morphologically and where the demarcation between them is unclear. It is found in shallow temperate, subtropical and tropical seas worldwide, wherever its host sponges are found. Description Haplosyllis spongicola is a small white segmented worm which lives parasitically on about forty known species of sponge around the world. It grows to a length of several centimetres. The body is cylindrical and the prostomium bears three antennae and four eyes. The pharynx has a single tooth surrounded by conical fleshy protuberances. Each segment bears paired appendages known as parapodia with tufts of cilia known as cirri on the dorsal and ventral sides. There are also a small number of simple chaetae or bristles on each segment. Distribution Haplosyllis spongicola has a cosmopolitan distribution and is found in shallow coastal habitats in both temperate and tropical locations throughout the world. The holotype came from Atlantic waters off the coast of Spain. Ecology Haplosyllis spongicola lives on the inside walls of a number of species of sponges. It inserts its proboscis into the individual cells and sucks out the contents. There may be tens of thousands of individual worms in one sponge and they are sometimes so abundant that they make up five percent of the weight of the sponge. On dark-coloured sponges such as Neofibularia nolitangere, the worms are easy to observe as they protrude from the inside walls of the sponge. In the Caribbean region, several species of small goby (Elacatinus spp.) live inside the sponges, feeding almost exclusively on the worms. Biology Haplosyllis spongicola reproduces by means of headless stolons that grow out of the parapodia, each having a pair of black ocular spots and up to thirty segments. They eventually detach and become new individuals.

Background  Campari-drinking Morgan owns Barry Morgan's World of Organs, a fictional, kitsch organ emporium in Adelaide's Sunnyside Mall. He plays a 1981 Hammond Aurora Classic organ through a Leslie speaker, and demonstrates the organ's abilities as a synthesizer, the Auto Vari 64 (for adding variation to the accompaniment) and the Zither arpeggiator. He is the proponent of the \\"one finger method\\" to control his organ's accompaniment section. Barry Morgan's World Of Organs is also cited by Australian cult sonic psychology band \\"Organ Grinder\\" (featuring members from noted Australian heavy metal bands Misery and Vegas Rhythm Kings). The band cites Morgan's World of Organs as their number 1 supplier in all things musical.  Reception  Morgan has been described as a cult figure, drawing reviews comparing his appearance to those of Wes Anderson and David Dickinson. Time Out listed Morgan as \\"critics' choice\\".

The Punic wall of Cartagena (Spanish: Muralla p√∫nica de Cartagena) is an archaeological site from the 3rd century BC in which can be seen the first defensive wall of Cartagena, built by the Carthaginians. This is an important site because it is one of the few remains of Carthaginian civilization in Spain, and the walls bear witness to one of the most important events of Ancient history in the Mediterranean Sea: the Second Punic War.  History  In 227 BC, the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal the Fair founded the city of Qart Hadasht, probably on an early Iberian settlement called Mastia. The new city was located on a peninsula in the middle of a bay and had five high hills, two of which were at the entrance of the isthmus, so it had a great position for the military defense. In this context, during the brief period of Punic domain upon Cartagena (227-209 BC), the Carthaginians decided to fortify the Barcid capital in Iberia with a wall that surrounded the settlement. The presence of this fortification was crucial to prevent a Roman assault led by the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio in 216 BC, when the Second Punic War had broken. However, with the arrival of General Scipio Africanus, the walls were able to contain the enemy only for a short time. The Romans besieged the place by land and sea, and taking advantage of their numerical superiority dodged the defenders stationed in the walls and conquered Qart Hadasht after a tough battle, signifying the beginning of the end of Carthaginian power in the south of the Iberian Peninsula.  Architecture  The wall used Hellenistic models: is composed of a double parallel paramento of tabaire (sandstone from local quarries) which retains a height of three meters. The ruins of the Punic walls that can be seen today belong to the lienzo of the section that extended to the entrance of the isthmus, between the hills of San Jos√© and Monte Sacro (in Antiquity called Aletes and Baal, respectively). During the archaeological excavations were found indications of a fire, possibly during the battle or the looting that followed. Currently the wall can be visited thanks to the Interpretation Center of the Punic Wall, part of the touristic consortium Cartagena Puerto de Culturas. The building protects the site and recreates their original elevation with contemporary architecture.

She released her first collaborative single \\"Dirty House Music\\" with DJ Marcus Knight in 2008 before releasing her debut studio album, Ascension, in 2010. Her debut single \\"Vertigo\\" peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play charts, effectively rendering her the first Australian unsigned female to make an impact on the US chart and making her a number-one Breakthrough Artist. Two years later, she released her second studio album, entitled 911: Code Pink. Early life Giulietta was born in the Melbourne suburb of Rowville, Australia, to parents Fabrice and Teresa. She has a younger brother, Antonio. Giulietta began singing at the age of four, regularly performing in talent shows and drawing inspiration from musicians such as Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and Celine Dion. At the age of nine she trained at NIDA in Sydney, and later attended a performing arts high school. Career In 2007, Giulietta met with DJ Marcus Knight and contributed vocals to his tracks \\"Give It Up\\" and \\"Dirty House Music\\". When the latter was released to nightclubs and other music outlets, it peaked at number four on the Beatport charts and charted twice on the ARIA Dance Chart, peaking within the top twenty. Giulietta also contributed vocals to tracks by Jacob D (\\"Take Your Mind There\\") and Dirty Rascals (\\"Venus\\"). In January 2009, producer David Kershenbaum met with Giulietta after hearing \\"Dirty House Music\\". She agreed to have him produce her debut album, which became Ascension. Though it was rumoured that Giulietta's family were paying up to A$40,000 a session with Kershenbaum, in an interview with the Herald Sun Teresa Russo stated, \\"I don't like to talk figures. I won't today, I won't in future.\\" In November 2009, Giulietta attended the Los Angeles Music Awards in Hollywood, California, where she won awards for International Pop Artist of the Year, Producer's Choice and the Hollywood Walk of Fame Award. She also performed a song called \\"Here We Go Again\\", which was originally slated to be the lead single off Ascension. On 17 May 2010, Giulietta released her debut album Ascension on her own label, Giulietta R. Enterprises, with distribution by Interscope Records. As well as featuring production from Kershenbaum the album also had writing by Ellis Miah and mixing by Rob Orton and Chris Cox. The album spawned the single \\"Vertigo\\", which reached No. 16 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Chart. The song was also remixed by the likes of Dave Aude. To promote the album, Giulietta performed at many venues including The Highlands nightclub in Hollywood and attended record releases for artists such as Lil' Jon. On her time promoting the album in the US, Giulietta stated, \\"It's a lot busier over there; I was doing 13 hours a day and rehearsing and doing things like Bikram yoga.\\" Giulietta also performed at R&B; festivals such as Summerbeatz in Melbourne. In February 2011, Giulietta began writing for her second album, which eventuated into 911: Code Pink. She enlisted Australian producer Simmy for the album's production, and the majority of the album was recorded in the USA. Though it was originally scheduled to be released on 19 November 2011, it was delayed several months with Giulietta stating that some of the instrumentals needed re-recording. After releasing the singles \\"Pixelated\\", \\"VooDoo\\" and \\"Pretty in Pink\\", the album was released in its entirety for free via SoundCloud and ClubTapes on 12 July 2012. The album contained guest appearances by Tay Dizm of Nappy Boy, Raz B of B2K, Mick Stillz, Dall. Diamond, Billionaire, Envy and Mr. Focus. In August 2012 Giulietta stated she would embark on her first tour of China later in the year. Influences Giulietta regards the likes of Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Lady Gaga, Pharrell, Gwen Stefani, Rihanna, The-Dream and Nicki Minaj as her influences.

Plot Tony is a second-generation Black British teenager, born and raised in Britain. The rest of his family ‚Äî his mother, father, and older brother ‚Äî were born in Trinidad in the Caribbean. This affects the family members' viewpoints about the society they live in. Tony's mother says they, as Black people, must work hard, mind their business and respect white people's laws because the whites have the power. The film shows how the older generations are satisfied with living in a society ruled by the white English, which differs from the views of the younger generation. There is a disconnection between the way Tony feels about Britain and the way that his family feels, specifically his brother. Tony's brother is active in the Black Power movement and is constantly discussing how Black people are treated as second-class citizens and constantly have to deal with systematic racism. He stresses the idea of a collective effort on behalf of Black people, as they encompass their culture and consciousness and they must spread this consciousness. He emphasises how Black people must organise politically to deal with the situation themselves, since the government is not on their side. Tony tries to assimilate into the white-dominated society that surrounds him as well as fit in with his own family and their traditions. However, as Tony tries to assimilate and maintain his faith in a British society where he can progress, he is continuously faced with obstacles. Tony goes dancing with a white friend and then goes back to her apartment. A white adult screams that if he does not leave she will call the police, and that the white girl should feel ashamed for bringing back a Black boy. When Tony attends one of his brother's meetings, he witnesses the mistreatment of Black people firsthand. Police forcefully enter the meeting with no warrant or reason and beat up and arrest the Black activists. Then, police tear apart Tony's family's home, in search of non-existent drugs. In addition to this, throughout the film, Tony cannot find a job that matches his educational qualifications. Events like this bring to light the forces of oppression and lead to Tony's disillusionment with a just English society. Tony also struggles with his identity as a black child born in England to West-Indian parents. He has difficulty relating to his brother who was not born in Europe, while he also cannot relate to his white friends, who do not share his obstacles in England. Tony's brother feels that all whites are evil. Tony comes to his own conclusions based on his experiences, declaring that since only a handful of white people hold all the power, many white people are in the same position as Black people, but just do not realise it.

Biography Alexandre Goria was born in Paris and admitted as a student at the age of seven to the Conservatoire de Paris on 15 November 1830. He had for piano teachers Adolphe-Francois Laurent (1796‚Äì1867), teacher of Jules Massenet, and Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmerman, teacher of Charles-Valentin Alkan and Cesar Franck, following a course of harmony under the direction of Victor Dourlen shortly thereafter. In 1834, he won second prize in the competition of piano, being awarded the first prize the following year at the age of 12. He later became r√©p√©titeur of the classes of competition in the conservatory. His studies were completed in 1839. Since then he engaged in teaching and became known in the music world by many different kinds of pieces for the piano. He was in very good terms with Bohemian composer Carl Czerny when he lived in Vienna for some time, and was also a very close friend of the American composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk who dedicated his composition Le Bananier to him. Awarded with the Knight's Cross of the Order of Charles III by the Queen of Spain, he died in Paris on 6 July 1860. Music Goria wrote over a hundred works for piano, including studies, fantasias, whims, solo concerts, nocturnes of various themes, polkas, mazurkas, lullabies, ballads and \\"r√©v√™ries\\". He was a highly acclaimed musician specially for his √âtude de concert, Op. 7 and his brilliant fantasias for piano on many theatrical works such as Plaintes de la jeune fille and other transcriptions of lieders by Franz Schubert and other composers.

After its closing in 1980 he attended and graduated, class of 1983, from Providence College, Providence, Rhode Island with a B.A. in Humanities. Work =Manhole cover printing= [It] was not until his late twenties that he realized art would be his life's work. In the spring of 1990, he tested the idea in New York City on East Forty-fifth Street and Third Avenue. The manhole cover became his printing plate. Sometimes he prints the entire cover, or sometimes he reproduces particular elements from its design. The pivotal act that cemented this decision was a series of five manhole cover prints titled, \\" Mandela : a man and his Freedom\\" from Basel, Switzerland. He signs his prints with the exact street address, city, and country in which the cover was found as well as the date it was printed are recorded. According to David Galloway, the results are documents of a particular culture at a particular time, but they are also and unmistakably \\"Brancaccio's.\\" For those who have encountered these bright, witty monoprints, the manhole will never be the same. Here are quite simply artists whose idiom changes the way we see our day-today environment: Dan Flavin's neon tubes, David Hockney's swimming pools and Daniel Buren's stripes have long since exerted such an impact. In sensitizing us to the art beneath our feet, Ralph Branaccio is thus in the best of company.‚ÄúThe World Beneath Our Feet‚Äù, by [David Galloway , The Hamsterwheel Published by Schlerugge 2007, Germany, page 26 Brancaccio has stated that, ‚ÄúBy putting myself at people‚Äôs feet, I bring beauty up to their level which causes them to look down.‚Äù An exhibition in the city museum Musee des Egouts de Paris titled \\"D'Egouts et des Couleurs\\" opened in June 1998.

The video \\"Lima Lives\\"- a true-life Atlanta story about a run away circus zebra named Lima and the attendant absurdities of police chasing \\"Perp 43\\" (to quote the police dispatcher)- was amusing and cleverly visualized.

Over 99+ artists transcended geographical, political and cultural boundaries to stage 99+ exhibitions throughout the world. Afterwards, all 10,000+ art works were given away in the guise of ‚Äúcoasters‚Äù at bars, cafes and restaurants.

Hobaica, Jr. The piece is titled, \\"One Earth\\". Participants were asked to plant French soil in their country and send soil to them from their country. These soil samples were then mixed and used to create tiles. In 2001 Brancaccio worked with the late Andrea Bronfman who chose a manhole cover print from the south of France from which he created a logo and theme that was used to adorn the celebrations of Charles Bronfman's seventieth birthday in the Israeli Negev Desert and on a Cunard Line yacht the Seabourn Goddess.Taken from http://www.saatchionline.com/RBranacccio Brancaccio partnered in 2001 with ActionAIDS to bring ‚ÄúThe Y Project‚Äù to Philadelphia, PA. While working towards authorization from the city to place ten Y sculptures, he collaborated with the Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial and the Rosenbach Museum & Library. Fourth graders at Greenfield Elementary School were taught manhole cover printing as part of the program \\"Planet Greenfield: A Neighborhood Mapping Project\\". He also taught his printing technique to adjudicated youth at ArtScape, a Mural Arts Program, and lectured at Central High School. Simultaneously the United States engaged in war with Iraq and due to a reduction in arts funding \\"The Y Project\\" for Philadelphia was put on hold.

Auctioned off was his conceptual portrait of Elizabeth Taylor, created with footprints from her shoes.\\"Y Not?\\", by A. D. Amorosi, Philadelphia City Paper, March 6, 2003.

Biography  Starting out as a guitarist in his teen years, Keller turned to the piano while attending Jesuit High School, inspired by the music of Claude Debussy, Brian Eno, and Harold Budd. As a composition student, Keller composed ballet scores and chamber music, including a string quartet premiered by the Kronos Quartet at the 1986 Festival of New American Music. Keller later studied Film Scoring at Berklee College of Music under the tutelage of Pinar Toprak. Keller's first solo recording \\"The Mask of Memory\\" (1994) came to the attention of radio producer Stephen Hill, who included several tracks on a Hearts of Space program titled \\"Digital Planet\\" in 1995. This was followed by a Living Room Concert and feature on Echoes, whose host John Diliberto named Keller's second CD \\"Intermezzo\\" as one of the Top 25 records of 1996. In total, Keller has released 11 full-length recordings and several EPs and compilations, working with musicians such as cellist David Darling, guitarist Jeff Pearce and Keller's own chamber ensemble of strings, woodwinds, percussion, and piano. Keller currently resides in New York City, where he composes music for choreographers such as Dwight Rhoden, Elisa Monte, Amy Marshall, and Ray Sullivan. Keller's works are administered by BMI. His 2012 album \\"The Day I Met Myself\\" was produced by Russel Walder; the album won the ZMR Music Award for Best Neo-Classical Album of 2012.

It was begun in the 13th century. The church is a Grade I listed building. Building West tower and north side of the church Construction of the church was begun in the 13th century and continued during the 14th and 15th centuries. The church is constructed of Bethersden marble and has plain tiled roofs. The late 14th-century west tower comprises three stages with buttresses on the external corners and a taller attached polygonal stair turret on the north-east corner. String courses separate each stage and a battlemented parapet forms the top of the walls on each side. The west side contains a three-lighted, cinquefoil-headed and traceried window in the first stage positioned above the small west door. The second stage contains small rectangular windows on the fa√ßades and the third stage contains two- or three- lighted belfry windows on each side with either trefoil or quatrefoil decoration. The nave is probably 14th-century and is flanked on the south side by a late 14th-century aisle with its attached porch of a similar age. The parapets of the aisle and porch are battlemented. The three aisle windows are cinquefoil-topped and the porch inner doorway is of Bethesden marble. The north wall of the nave contains four three-lighted traceried windows separated by buttresses. The chancel is 13th century with the windows replaced probably in the late 14th century or in the 15th century. The east end is gabled with a tall window of two stacked groups of three cinquefoil-topped lights. Abutting the south side of the chancel is the south chapel which also dates from the 14th century. Four two-lighted windows alternate with buttresses on the south chapel wall and the east end contains a five-lighted traceried window. Internally, the nave and south aisle are separated by an arcade of five pointed arches on octagonal columns with bases and capitals in Bethesden marble. The arch between chancel and nave and between south aisle and south chapel are similar. An arcade of two bays divides the chancel from the south chapel. The collar-rafter roof to the nave is late 14th century or early 15th century with seven moulded trusses. The pitched roof of the chancel is boarded and the roofs of the aisle and chapel are flat and boarded. The 15th-century font is octagonal with carved sides. Piscina are located in the south walls at the east end of the aisle and the east end of the chapel and in the chancel. The screen is partly 16th century with linenfold panelling which also features on the late 19th century pulpit.

Her African- ancestry parents Winston and Sonia Brillianton emigrate to England when she is still a child. Sonia does not claim her until Gwendolen is 11, paying for her passage to England. In Jamaica Gwendolen is sexually abused by a middle-aged neighbour Uncle Johnny. She tells this secret to her grandmother, who confronts the man and reveals it to the rest of their neighbours, thus bringing shame to Gwendolen. In England Gwendolen attends school and helps take care of her two younger brothers, Ronald and Marcus, and their youngest sister, Cheryl. When her mother goes back to Jamaica for an extended visit to attend to her dead grandmother Naomi, Gwendolen was again sexually abused ‚Äì this time by her father Winston. She becomes pregnant; however, it is believed that the baby belongs to Emmanuel, Gwendolen's teenaged Greek boyfriend. Gwendolen is institutionalized in a mental hospital after going hysterical, but she tells no one the parentage of her unborn child for fear that her father may be imprisoned.

Following the album's release, Vile stated that Constant Hitmaker is \\"like a best-of, sort of, but leaning toward the psychedelic pop stuff, kind of my later material.\\" Background and recording The majority of the album's tracks are home recordings, however, the album's opening track, \\"Freeway\\", was recorded at Miner Street studios with producer Brian McTear. Vile noted, \\"We were doing \\"Freeway\\" live ‚Äî me and my buddy Adam at the time ‚Äî and the live show was going good, and on that version we'd play along to the drum machine and blast guitars.

In the winter, you can write some darker songs, but it does depend on what's going on at the time.\\" Regarding the album's lo- fi aesthetic, Vile noted, \\"[the album] has songs that maybe if you don't normally listen to that stuff, you'd think were a bit throwaway because of the recording quality.\\" Release and reception Regarding the album's initial release on Gulcher Records, Vile stated, \\"I‚Äôm glad he did it ‚Äî he really got the record out there. I didn‚Äôt know what labels to send stuff to. I‚Äôd meet bands I liked and give it to them. Like Ariel Pink, and bands would like it but I could never get someone to put it out. So my friend Richie who drums in Clockcleaner hooked me up. [...] I was paranoid about the recordings because I‚Äôd had them so long. I‚Äôd fixate on one detail.

It‚Äôs pretty cheesy at times but you learn to embrace it. The words just keep coming and coming and you're like \\"How the fuck did Dylan think up all these insane lyrics, and why are the back-up singers repeating every single line?\\" Then, before you know it, you're hooked 'cause there's always another whacked line you missed.

Biography  Antonia Pozzi was born in 1912 in Milan. She was the daughter of the lawyer Roberto Pozzi and Countess Lina Cavagna Sangiuliani di Gualdana. She entered the Manzoni High School in 1922. She became romantically involved with her Classics teacher at the Manzoni school, Antonio Maria Cervi; the relationship ended in 1933, possibly due to her parents' intervention. In 1930 she enrolled in the Faculty of Philology of the University of Milan, where she became friends with the poet Vittorio Sereni and other writers of her own generation. In 1935, she received a degree in Literature, based on a thesis about Gustave Flaubert. She had begun writing poetry as a teenager. She kept a diary, wrote letters, and took photographs, recording her studies and travels as well as her feelings. Her home and personal library were in the family villa in Pasturo, at the foot of the Grigna mountains in Lombardy. At one point she planned to write a historical novel set in Lombardy. In 1938, she worked at the magazine Corrente. On 2 December 1938, following a barbiturate suicide attempt, she was found unconscious in a ditch in front of Chiaravalle Abbey, a suburb of Milan. She died the next day and was buried in the small cemetery of Pasturo. The family refused to admit it was a suicide, attributing her death to pneumonia. Antonia's will was destroyed by her father. Her poems, written in notebooks and unpublished before her death, were also heavily edited by him for publication. Pozzi is considered to be one of the most original voices in modern Italian literature. In her lifetime she wrote 300 poems, all published posthumously after her death in 1938, aged 26. Although Pozzi did not gain recognition for her work in her own lifetime, her poems have later been published many times in Italy, and she has been translated into several languages.

Louis of France (21 or 24 February 1244 - 11 January 1260) was the eldest son of King Louis IX of France and his wife Margaret of Provence. As heir apparent to the throne, he served as regent for a brief period.  Regency  In 1248, King Louis and Queen Margaret traveled to Egypt to participate in the Seventh Crusade. During their absence, his grandmother, Blanche of Castile, acted as regent. However, when she died in 1252, his parents were still crusading and the eight-year-old Louis was appointed regent. He did not actually rule the country; real power was in the hands of a royal council, led by his uncles Alphonse and Charles. Nevertheless, royal deeds were sealed in his name, and correspondence to the government was addressed to him personally. The basis of the arrangement was the unwritten (at the time) principle of primogeniture in French law: in the absence of written instructions to the contrary, the king's eldest son automatically became regent during the king's absence. This regency ended when Louis IX returned to Paris in 1254.  Education and engagement  In subsequent years, Louis was educated for his future role as king. The legal scholar Pierre de Fontaines dedicated his textbook to Prince Louis. On 20 August 1255, he was betrothed to Alfonso X of Castile's daughter Berengaria. At the time, she was heir presumptive of Castile. However, shortly after the betrothal, Ferdinand de la Cerda was born, displacing his sister. Louis and his younger brother Philip witnessed the sealing and oaths confirming the 1259 Treaty of Paris, which was intended to end the territorial conflict between England and France that had been raging since 1180. This treaty required that King Henry III of England pay homage to King Louis IX of France, which he did the following year.  Death and aftermath  Louis fell ill after Christmas 1259 and died shortly after New Year, aged fifteen, a month before his sixteenth birthday. The theologian Vincent of Beauvais wrote a for Louis IX, which is considered the traditional Christian consolation and a masterpiece in its genre. Louis' younger brother succeeded their father in 1270 as Philip III. Louis was buried in Royaumont Abbey. He was not buried in the royal crypt in Saint-Denis, because a decree of Louis IX reserves this crypt for crowned heads. Nevertheless, Louis' body was transferred there in 1817.

A new core range of 10, 12, 18 and 25 year old whisky was released in 2018 under the new ownership, as well as additional single cask releases. History The GlenAllachie distillery was built in 1967 by Mackinlay McPherson. It was bought and mothballed by Invergordon Distillers in 1985. They sold it to Campbell Distillers in 1989, who restarted the distillery. In 2017, the distillery was sold to Billy Walker, Graham Stevenson and Trisha Savage, who came together as The GlenAllachie Distillers Company Limited, along with two blended Scotch whisky brands - White Heather and MacNair's.http://www.theglenallachie.com/ Building The building of the GlenAllachie distillery was designed by S. Lothian Barclay from Lothian, Barclay Jarvis & Boys and William Delme-Evans It is located at the foot of Ben Rinnes, close to the Lour burn. The grounds has ponds that are fed by the Lour, that provide water for cooling. Production The distillery draws its water from spring fed and snow water fed streams on Ben Rinnes. It uses lightly peated malts. The distillery uses a semi-lauter mash tun, and six stainless steel washbacks. It uses two lantern shaped wash stills, and two onion shaped spirit stills for distillation. The distilled spirit is matured in used oak bourbon barrels. Though the malt is mainly used in blends, it produces a 16-year-old cask-strength bottling since 2005, and an 18-year-old bottling since 2008. It is mainly used in the Chivas Brothers Cask Strength Clan Campbell blend, and also in the Legendary and White Heather blended whiskies. The whisky is bottled and sold as a twelve-year-old single malt by Delhaize, and Signatory bottles vintage editions of the whisky.

There was no educational system at the time. Gradually some of the more ambitions students of GB moved toward different cities (such as Karachi and Lahore) in search of a better education. Some of them returned to their home after completion of their education, and started teaching their children, thus making people aware of what it was to be literate. They demanded the government build schools in the region, but their demand was neglected because the region didn't have a representative in the senate or National Assembly (Pakistan). After several years, schools were opened in Gilgit-Baltistan and thus its educational system came into being. Beginnings At first, only primary and middle-schools were available. Gradually, these middle-schools were upgraded to high-schools. In the 1970s, students had to migrate in order to attend university. The revolution in education began when private schools began to emerge under the Jabir Bin Hayyan trust initiative. Then after a sudden several private schools began to emerge. According to one news report the private sector contributes 90% of the infrastructure for the overall education in Gilgit Baltistan. The Aga Khan foundation was also the other NGO which contributed to the spread of education. Actuality During the last decade the first higher education institutions were constructed. The first university, Karakoram University, was founded during the reign of Pervez Musharaf. The university was established in 2002 by a charter from the federal government on the orders of Pervez Musharraf, President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Another campus of this university was established in Skardu Hussain Abad in 2010, though it currently faces financial strains. GOVERNMENT UNIVERSITIES IN GIGIT BALTISTAN *1.

KIU GHIZAR (sub campus) There are eighteen colleges in GB, including eight girls' colleges and ten boys' colleges. Ten of them are in the Gilgit district and seven are in the Skardu District. Seven are degree colleges, eight are intermediate and other two are elementary colleges. Statistics According to a World Bank Economic Report On Gilgit-Baltistan (2010‚Äì11), the net primary school enrolment in Gilgit Baltistan is 51%, the net middle-school enrollment is 17%, and only 14% are enrolled in matric school. In other words, only 17 out of every 100 students achieve the middle level and only 14 out of every 100 students reach to matric level. According to a current survey, approximately a thousand students belonging to Baltistan are studying in different colleges and universities of Karachi. There are no medical or engineering colleges in the area. A large number of students are studying in different colleges and schools of Pakistan. However, seats for Gilgit-Baltistan are very limited in engineering and medical colleges. There are no scholarship programs for higher education in GB. Medical colleges in Karachi do not provide a single seat for students coming from Gilgit- Baltistan. On September 29, 2009 Prime Minister Gillani announced the foundation of the first medical college. However, construction hasn't begun. Currently, the local government has allocated an amount of over Rs361 million (5.3% of the total budget) towards education in the area.

It is the only genus in the order Silicoloculinida and the family Silicoloculinidae. It is sometimes referred to by the junior synonym Silicoloculina. The family Silicoloculinidae, named by Resig, et al., 1980, is characterized by tests that resemble those of the imperforate calcareous Miliolidae, or the finely agglutinated Rzehakinidae in which chambers are about half a coil in length and arranged in various planes. Resig et al. named the genus Silicoloculina for specimens recovered from below the carbonate compensation depth in the Scotia Sea and the Peru-Chile Trench. Loeblich and Tappan synonymised this genus with Miliamellus in 1987. Miliammellus, named by Saidova and Burmistrova, 1978, has a small ovoid test, up to 0.5 mm long with chambers arranged as in the miliolid Quinqueloculina. Chambers are slightly more than half a coil in length, resulting in successive whorls being offset, and are widest at their base, narrowing toward the aperture, a low arch at the end of the final chamber. Miliammellus has a range from the Upper Miocene to recent and has been found in the Bering Sea, Antarctic, north and central Pacific, and Indian Oceans at abyssal depths below 4,000 m. The type species is Miliammellus legis Saidova and Burmistrova, 1978. Its test ultrastructure consists of small (5Œºm by 0.3Œºm), hollow rods of silica arranged in subparallel sheets, with an outer and inner organic membrane. The outer and inner organic layers are each approximately 0.1Œºm in thickness. The middle silica layer is about 19Œºm thick in total; it is further broken down into an outer, inner, and middle silica subunit. The outer and inner silica subunits are each approximately 0.2Œºm thick and consist of hollow silica rods arranged in subparallel sheets, with the elongation parallel to the surface. The middle silica subunit is approximately 18Œºm thick and consists of a randomly oriented lattice of hollow silica rods. No organic material is found within the open spaces between rods. In overall shape as well as in ultrastructure, Miliamellus resembles miliolilid foraminifera. However, the ultrastructure differs in that the rods of miliolid test walls are solid rather than hollow, smaller, and of course are made of calcite.

The Fokker 100 was operated by Palair, the then national airline of Macedonia (now North Macedonia). A total of 83 people, 79 passengers and 4 crew members, were killed in the crash while 14 people survived. At the time, it was the deadliest plane crash in the country. It was surpassed a few months later on the same year when a Yakovlev Yak-42 slammed onto a mountain near Ohrid. It was the deadliest aviation accident involving a Fokker 100 at the time it took place, a record it maintained until TAM Flight 402 crashed on 31 October 1996. Flight 301 is still the second-deadliest Fokker 100 crash. The investigation of the disaster, which was assisted by the Dutch investigation team, concluded that the cause of the accident was loss of roll controllability due to the accumulation of ice on the wings of the aircraft. Also known as atmospheric icing, the ice accumulation caused the deterioration of lift force. Failure to adhere to the correct procedure for handling an atmospheric icing was also cited as one of the causes of the crash. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the accident was a Fokker 100 with a registration code of PH-KXL, with a serial number of 11393. The aircraft was new, built in 1992 and was sent to Palair in 27 January 1993. It had accrued a total of 188 flight hours and 136 flight cycles. Passengers and crews Flight 301 carried 92 passengers and 5 crew members. Most of the passengers were Kosovars who were going to work in Switzerland. The flight was flown by members of the Aircraft Financing and Trading (AFT), a company based in the Netherlands, based on a leased contract. Both pilots had the rank of captain. The pilot in command (pilot not flying (PNF), training captain) was 49-year-old Peter Bierdrager, a Dutch national. He had his last medical check in 1992 and had accrued a total flying experience of 11,200 hours, of which 1,180 hours were in the Fokker 100. Other than the Fokker 100 license, he had also obtained licenses for Fokker F-27, Fokker 28 and Fokker 50. The captain-under-training (pilot flying (PF) and acting captain) was an unnamed 34-year old Macedonian. He had a total flying experience of 5,580 hours, of which 65 hours were in the Fokker. Before he joined AFT, he was a pilot at the Yugoslav's JAT. Flight Flight 301 was an international scheduled passenger flight originating in Skopje, Macedonia, with a final destination of Zurich, Switzerland. 92 passengers and 5 crew members were on board the aircraft. The Fokker 100, registered as PH-KXL, belonged to Palair Macedonian Airlines, the then national airline of the country. Takeoff clearance was given at 11:11 local time. As Flight 301 took off, it was snowing and visibility was limited to 900 meters; observation on the ground confirmed that the visibility was poor enough that the end of the runway could not be seen from Flight 301's position. Flight 301 became airborne 28 seconds after its takeoff clearance. Just 2 seconds after taking off from Runway 34, the aircraft began to shake violently. While climbing through an approximate height of 50 ft and with an air speed of about 170 miles per hour, Flight 301 rolled severely to the left and then to the right, with a bank angle of 50 and 55 degrees, respectively. The flight crew immediately applied ailerons and rudder input to correct the attitude of the aircraft. The autopilot cavalry chimed and the sink rate warning sounded. The aircraft's right wing tip struck the ground beyond the end of the runway with an angle of 90 degrees. Flight 301 cartwheeled before crashing to the ground, with the fuselage breaking up into three pieces. The aircraft immediately exploded and burst into flames. The first report of the crash was received from a United Nations Peacekeeper who heard the impact while he was walking towards the ramp. He then immediately flew to the crash site and rescued 7 survivors from the crash site. More emergency services from the airport and the United Nations then arrived at the crash site. As many as 20 survivors, of whom 5 were in critical condition, were transported to the hospital in Skopje. However, 4 survivors would later be pronounced dead on arrival. Several others succumbed to their injuries. Remarkably, the only surviving crew member, a flight attendant, suffered only minor injuries. Investigation =Weather= Weather data collected by investigators suggested that there was light to moderate snow prior and during the accident. Airport workers reported that the snow melted when it touched the ground. Prior to the accident, there was no visible snow on the runway, taxiway or apron. Investigators confirmed that it was a wet snow, that is, snow mixed with rain. Temperature at the airport was recorded to be at 0¬∞ Celsius. The aircraft was exposed to wet snow and the temperature was lower than the freezing dew point, a conducive condition for an atmospheric icing. =Wing contamination= The aircraft had been checked for signs of snow and ice by ground crews prior to its take off. Statements collected by investigators suggest that the inspection concentrated on the right wing. Investigators noted that there was no evidence that the left wing had been inspected as comprehensively as the right one. Estimation conducted by investigators showed that the aircraft had been exposed with light precipitation, which later increased to moderate, for 1 hour and 15 minutes, with an unspecified amount of thickness. Due to the prevailing weather condition, investigators believed that the aircraft's wing upper surface had been covered with a thin layer of snow and possibly frozen to the skin. According to the ground crews, several people had touched the wing leading edge to detect ice. However, due to the height of the aircraft, only tall people were able to do this. They would also be only able to touch the leading edge near the wingtip; however, they would not be able to reach the wing upper surface right behind the leading edge. Further examination revealed that the aircraft had arrived in Skopje with a relatively large amount of fuel that had a very low temperature. This caused the wet snow, which was falling onto the surface of the wing, to freeze. This was later confirmed as inspection revealed that frosts had been detected under the fuel tanks. However, even though the aircraft had been covered by snow, the Flight Station Engineer and the ground crew had only reported \\"wet of melted snow\\". Investigators stated that they possibly had suffered an illusion. As per the final report, investigators stated: > The wing upper surface temperature of the collector tank and main tank > compartment 1 responded rapidly to the warmer fuel being added. In the test > the maximum skin temperature remained below the temperature of the fuel in > the fuel truck. But on Skopje airport the temperatures of the outside air, > the aircraft and the fuel in the truck were not so far apart, only the > residual fuel in the aircraft tanks was much colder. It is, therefore, > conceivable that during and after refueling of Palair 301 the upper skin > temperatures of the collector tank and main tank compartment 1 could have > approached the fuel truck temperature closer than in the test This warming > effect due to the added fuel being well above 0¬∞ C could, according to the > test result, remain during the time between the first and second refueling > and again on the second refueling. For an observer this could create the > impression that the snow was melting on the wing just like on the ground > because of the nature of the snow and the (air) temperature and not because > of some other effect. This would be an illusion, however, because the outer > half of the wing tank could not benefit from this warming effect and would > thus collect snow. The warming effect causing the snow to melt on the > inboard wing part would anyhow soon disappear after the boosterpumps were > switched on prior to engine start. It was later confirmed that the ground crew had only checked the inner part of the wing and had not checked the outer part. As snow on the inner part of the wing melted, this would create an impression that there were no more snow left on the wing and that all snow had melted, including those on the outer wing, which is why investigators called this as an illusion. =Lack of attention to icing= During the aircraft's previous flight to Skopje, which was operated by the same crew, the weather was not in a snowy condition. Light snow was only encountered when the aircraft was approaching Skopje, and reports stated that the snowflakes immediately melted when it contacted an object. Due to this, the crew did not pay attention to the weather, exposed themselves minimally to the weather, and focused mainly on the cockpit instruments. Investigators stated that the crew might have thought that the weather wasn‚Äôt a threat to the safety of the aircraft. The Flight Station Engineer also stated that the aircraft would not require a de-icing, as the snow was regarded as \\"harmless\\". The airline‚Äôs standard operating procedure stated that a pilot had to perform the outside preflight inspection of the aircraft. On this flight, however, this rule was not followed. Instead, the outside inspection was delegated to the Flight Station Engineer. The Flight Station Engineer was regarded as highly experienced, and thus the crew believed his words when he said that the aircraft did not need de-icing. Post-accident analysis of the weather data, however, suggests that the aircraft would have needed to be de-iced. Recordings taken from the CVR show that the crew did not mention anything about the weather and that they apparently never realized that the weather might have caused their loss of control of the aircraft. =Conclusion= The investigation board \\"determined that impact with the ground in a steep right bank shortly after liftoff was caused by loss of roll controllability due to contamination of the wings with ice. This situation resulted from an omission to carry out spraying of the aircraft with deicing or anti-icing fluid in meteorological conditions conducive to icing, due to a lack of ice-awareness of the flight crew and the Flying Station Engineer. Contributing factors were a lack of common background and procedures in a difficult multi-sources operational environment.\\" See also * List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft * List of aircraft accidents and incidents resulting in at least 50 fatalities * Avioimpex Flight 110, a 1993 aviation disaster that took place in Macedonia ;Similar incidents * Air Ontario Flight 1363 * Air Florida Flight 90 * Air Algerie Flight 5017 References External links *Palair Macedonian Airlines Flight 301 at Airdisaster.com (Archive) Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1993 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in North Macedonia Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Fokker 100 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by ice Category:Palair Macedonian Airlines accidents and incidents Category:1993 in the Republic of Macedonia Category:March 1993 events in Europe ","title":"Palair Macedonian Airlines Flight 301"},{"id":"36694415","text":"Queenswood Country Park is the only designated country park in the county of Herefordshire. A tourist attraction on Dinmore Hill, it has two components. Its arboretum is a tree collection with over 1,200 rare and frequently exotic trees. Queenswood ancient woodland is a lightly coppiced woodland to maintain a semi-natural habitat which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Local Nature Reserve (LNR). The site is managed by a partnership between Herefordshire Wildlife Trust and New Leaf.  History  Queenswood is a fragment of the vast ancient oak wood that once stretched to the Welsh borders and beyond. It frequently reverted to the source of all estates, \\"the crown\\" (the monarch) intermittently, and changed its name from 'Kings Wood' to 'Queenswood' in the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. During the 17th century Queenswood belonged to the adjacent Hampton Court House or Castle which is on the opposite side of the local main road. During World War I the woods were virtually clear-felled to provide timber for the war effort.  Arboretum  The planting of the arboretum at Queenswood began in 1953 to mark the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. It was funded by an ongoing public appeal - 'The Queenswood Coronation Fund' - launched by Sir Richard Cotterell who was then chairman of the Queenswood Management Committee and Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire. Numerous donations from the people of Herefordshire allowed Sir Richard to realise part of his vision for the site and purchase many of the rare and beautiful trees that can still be enjoyed today. The work of the Queenswood Coronation Fund received international recognition in 1981 when the arboretum received the prestigious Dendrology Award from the International Dendrology Society in recognition of the quality of the collection of trees. The Queenswood Coronation Fund is a perpetual fund and is now a registered charity (No. 518624) which continues to receive many donations from those who have visited and enjoyed the country park and arboretum.

Under the Act it was compulsory that in the first year of operation 5 per cent, of the films distributed in New South Wales must be Australian productions, the percentage to increase yearly for five years when it becomes 15 per cent. The Act was introduced at the behest of New South Wales' Premier Bertram Stevens. Its ultimate impact turned out to be limited due to a loophole in the legislation. The use of the word \\"acquire\\" meant it was considered that the act was drafted to reflect exhibition of films, not ensure production; distributors argued they had no obligation to produce movies. Some American distributors made veiled threats to remove Hollywood films from exhibition. In 1937 the New South Wales government decided not to force distributors to participate in production. Similar legislation was passed in Victoria but was never proclaimed. By the end of the decade the quota law had ceased to operate in practice.Early history of Australian Film, Screen Australia accessed 24 August 2014 See also *Screen quotas References External links *Copy of Act Category:Cinema of Australia Category:New South Wales legislation Category:1935 in Australian law Category:1930s in New South Wales Category:Quotas ","title":"Film Quota Act"},{"id":"36694634","text":"The following list includes notable people who were born or have lived in Sherman, Texas.

The rover was also known as Microrover Flight Experiment abbreviated MFEX. Sojourner has solar panels and a non-rechargeable battery, which allowed limited nocturnal operations. Once the batteries were depleted, it could only operate during the day. The batteries are lithium-thionyl chloride (LiSOCl2) and could provide 150 watt-hours. The batteries also allowed the health of the rover to be checked while enclosed in the cruise stage while en route to Mars. 0.22 square meters of solar cells could produce a maximum of about 15 watts on Mars, depending on conditions. The cells were GaAs/Ge (Gallium Arsenide/Germanium) and capable of about 18 percent efficiency. They could survive down to about ‚àí140¬∞ Celsius (‚àí220 ¬∞F). Its central processing unit (CPU) is an 80C85 with a 2 MHz clock, addressing 64 Kbytes of memory. It has four memory stores; the previously mentioned 64 Kbytes of RAM (made by IBM) for the main processor, 16 Kbytes of radiation-hardened PROM (made by Harris), 176 Kbytes of non-volatile storage (made by Seeq Technology), and 512 Kbytes of temporary data storage (made by Micron). The electronics were housed inside the Warm Electronics Box inside the rover. Sojourner communicated with its base station using a 9,600 baud radio modem, although error-checking protocols limited communications to a functional data rate of 2,400 baud with a theoretical range of about half a kilometer. Under normal operation, it would periodically send a \\"heartbeat\\" message to the lander. If no response was given, the rover could autonomously travel back to the location at which the last heartbeat was received. If desired, this same strategy could be used to deliberately extend the rover's operational range beyond that of its radio transceiver, although the rover rarely traveled further than 10 meters from Pathfinder during its mission. The UHF radio modems worked similar to walkie- talkies, but sent data, not voice. It could send or receive, but not both at same time, which is known as half-duplex. The data was communicated in bursts of 2 kilobytes. The Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) is nearly identical to the one on Mars 96, and was a collaboration between the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Lindau, Germany (formally known as the Max Planck Institute For Aeronomy) and the University of Chicago in the United States. APXS could determine elemental composition of Mars rocks and dust, except for hydrogen. It works by exposing a sample to alpha particles, then measuring the energies of emitted protons, X-rays, and backscattered alpha particles. The rover had three cameras: two monochrome cameras in front, and a color camera in the rear. Each front camera had an array 484 pixels high by 768 wide. The optics consisted of a window, lens, and field flattener. The window was made of sapphire, while the lens objective and flattener were made of zinc selenide. The rover was imaged on Mars by the base station's IMP camera system, which also helped determine where the rover should go. Sojourner operation was supported by \\"Rover Control Software\\", which ran on a Silicon Graphics Onyx2 computer back on Earth, and allowed command sequences to be generated using a graphical interface. The rover driver would wear 3D goggles supplied with imagery from the base station and move a virtual model with the spaceball controller, a specialized joystick. The control software allowed the rover and surrounding terrain to be viewed from any angle or position, supporting the study of terrain features, placing waypoints, or doing virtual flyovers. The rover had a mass of 11.5 kg (weighing about 25 pounds on Earth), which equates to a weight of 4.5 kgf (10 pounds) on Mars.  In popular culture  * In the 2000 film Red Planet, the crew of the first manned mission to Mars survives the crash-landing of their entry vehicle, but their communications equipment is destroyed so they cannot contact their recovery vehicle in orbit. To reestablish contact before being presumed dead and left behind by the pilot of their recovery vehicle, the crew goes to the site of the Pathfinder rover, from which they salvage parts to make a basic radio.Pfarrer, Chuck; Lemkin, Jonathan (2000). \\"Red Planet\\" (PDF).

It was entered into the 10th Moscow International Film Festival.  Plot  In Senegal, sometime after the establishment of a European presence in the area but before the imposition of direct French colonial administration, the Ceddo (the outsiders, or non-Muslims) try to preserve their traditional culture against the onslaught of Islam, Christianity, and the slave trade. When local king Demba War sides with the Muslims, the Ceddo abduct his daughter, Dior Yacine, to protest their forced conversion to Islam. Two members of the tribe try and fail to recapture the princess. Fearing their position is under threat, the local Imam inspires the muslims to kill the king and the white christian slave-traders. They convert the entire village to Islam by force, and manage to recapture the princess. When returning to the village, Dior Yacine rallies the ceddo against the muslims, and kills the Imam who has taken her father's throne.  Background  When questioned on what year the film takes place Ousmane said: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt give a date. These events occurred in the 18th and 19th century and are still occurring‚Äù. The story can be viewed as an abridged version of West-African history, and the village as a microcosm of the continent. For Semb√®ne, the Ceddo embody the resistance of a culture and a traditional way of life to the encroachments of Islam, Christianity and colonialism.

Plot Annie and Buster Fang are the children of famous performance artists who, in the late 80s and early 90s, perform public interactive pieces with audiences who are unaware that they are performers and whose acts typically involve their children whom they film and credit as child A (Annie) and child B (Buster). Annie grows up to be a highly successful actress who has been nominated for an Academy Award while Buster becomes a mediocre novelist who must supplement his work with freelance journalism. However, after being told by the director of her latest movie to appear nude in a scene, Annie begins to experience a nervous breakdown, appearing unstable to the media. Meanwhile, whilst on assignment in Nebraska covering a pair of war veterans who build spud guns, Buster is shot in the face and hospitalized. With limited funds and mounting medical debt he returns to his parents' home. After being dumped by her publicist, Annie learns that her ex-boyfriend, who is a screenwriter, has been hired to write Annie out of the third installment of the franchise that made her a star. She consents to go with him on a trip to Wyoming. However, after he threatens to destroy her, she runs away from him at the airport and goes to see Buster. Immediately, Caleb and Camille attempt to force Annie and Buster to participate in one of their performance art pieces which involves handing out free coupons for chicken sandwiches and then watching as the crowd goes mad after the sandwiches are denied to them. Nonetheless, the stunt goes terribly wrong when Annie and Buster refuse to participate. Camille and Caleb are unable to hand out more than a few coupons and the people at the sandwich shop mistakenly believe that the coupons are valid and hand out sandwiches. For a while Annie and Buster stay in their parents house feeling aimless. Annie discovers nearly a hundred paintings in her closet which her mother claims as her own, saying that she was a painter before she was a conceptual artist and had been slowly returning to that medium. She gives a painting each to Annie and Buster. Buster receives a phone call from a local creative writing professor and, with Annie's support, speaks coherently to the creative writing class. After the class he is handed a stack of short stories by the professor and immediately connects to one written by a woman named Suzanne Crosby who he gives his number to in the hopes she will contact him with more of her work. Upon returning home he and Annie discover a note by their parents informing them they have gone to North Carolina. Freed from their parents, Annie and Buster go about dealing with their issues, including Buster's medical debt, which Annie decides to pay, and Annie's alcoholism, which Buster says she must wean herself off of. They later receive a call from a police officer claiming their parents are missing and possibly dead. Annie immediately believes this is part of a performance art piece while Buster suspects it is real. Annie resolves to go looking for her parents in order to prove they are still alive. Annie and Buster go to visit Caleb's mentor Hobart Waxman. Hobart agrees with Annie that the Fangs are likely alive but tells them they have been given a gift and they should continue their lives without their parents. Annie refuses to accept this. Annie and Buster decide that the best way to lure their parents out of hiding is to put on an exhibition of Camille's portraits. However, the exhibition is a failure. Camille and Caleb do not appear and Annie and Buster decide to accept the fact that their parents are dead. They slowly begin to put their lives back together. Buster begins working on a novel and decides to move in with Suzanne while Annie accepts a role from the writer/director who directed her to an Academy Award nomination, Lucy Wayne. Before the siblings can fully move on with their lives, Suzanne gives Buster a heavy metal CD made by twin prodigies. Buster and Annie recognize the lyrics to their song Kill All Parents as a song their parents forced them to perform as children for a piece that was not recorded and therefore unavailable to the public. Pretending to be a music journalist, Buster contacts the twins for an interview and is able to get them to admit that the song was written by their father. The twins' mother then goes on the phone and asks them to leave their father alone. Annie and Buster travel to North Dakota where they find their father living under the name Jim Baltz. He contacts their mother, who is living under the name Patricia Howlett and the four Fangs meet in the food court of an abandoned mall. Caleb admits that the two began to plan their disappearance approximately ten years earlier when Annie left home to become an actress. They plan to reveal themselves as living after they are legally declared dead in 7 years. Annie agrees not to blow their cover in exchange for never seeing them again. The parents readily agree and the Fangs part. Ultimately Annie finds creative success on the set of Lucy's new movie and contemplates starting a romantic relationship with her. She realizes that Buster has surpassed her in managing to achieve peace and contentment and hopes to find the same.

It was first published in hardback in the United States by Orbit Books on January 15, 2010. A paperback and audiobook release was also published during the same year; the audiobook is narrated by T. Ryder Smith. Set during the Great Depression, the book follows one man's attempt to take his revenge against the one who murdered his daughter. It has been described by the Los Angeles Review of Books as featuring \\"a band of Depression-era hobo vigilantes who trek across the Dust Bowl after the supernatural boogeyman, a metaphorical specter who haunts the starved nation\\". After its release the book won several literary awards, including the 2010 Shirley Jackson Award for Best Novel.  Synopsis  The novel follows the character of Marcus Connelly, a man whose marriage deteriorated after his beloved daughter is murdered by a man known only as the \\"Shiver Man\\". Intent on finding him and making him pay for his crimes, Connelly sets out on the rails and travels from location to location in search of work and clues. While he faces several setbacks ‚Äì as well as several warnings to leave the killer alone ‚Äì Connelly finds support via other travelers who are also looking to bring about the Shiver Man's death. Along the way it becomes apparent that the Shiver Man is more than he seems, as he is capable of escaping any prison cell and other feats that would be impossible for normal human beings.  Development  For the book, Bennett chose to set the novel during the Great Depression as \\"just mentioning its name summons up a world in the reader‚Äôs head\\" and has specified that Mr. Shivers is set in \\"the idea of The Great Depression, the one we all have\\" and that he was \\"playing around with our own myths\\", as he felt that the United States does not \\"get the cool King Arthur origin story\\". He also felt that hobo culture would fit in the novel as he saw it as being \\"untapped in horror/fantasy\\" and that the \\"idea of an American hobo is already half-founded in tall tales and folklore\\". The titular character of Mr. Shivers was partially based on an incident from Bennett's childhood, when he came across a man smoking a cigarette under a bridge. Bennett stated that the man \\"waved at me like he recognized me, and smiled, and it wasn‚Äôt a nice smile. Funny thing was, I felt like I recognized him, too.\\" Critical reception Critical reception for Mr. Shivers has been generally positive, with The Guardian stating that the book was \\"a startling d√©but, a deft amalgam of thriller, cerebral horror and American gothic, written with a stark and artful simplicity that complements the examination of struggling humanity pushed to its limits.\\" Common praise for the book centers on Bennett's writing, as Tor.com's Stefan Raets stated that \\"If the setting‚Äôs what pulled me into the novel, Robert Jackson Bennett‚Äôs spectacular prose is what sold me\\". The setting was also frequently highlighted favorably in reviews, as Michael Dirda of The Washington Post felt that it was \\"convincingly bleak\\" while also praising the titular character and comparing him to Hannibal Lecter. Barry Forshaw of the Daily Express also drew comparisons, comparing Bennett to Stephen King and John Steinbeck. SF Signal and the Historical Novel Society also reviewed the book, with the former stating that while readers familiar with science fiction, horror, and fantasy tropes would find some parts of the book predictable, it was also a \\"very strong debut novel\\". Bennett has stated that some readers have complained that the book did not have enough gore or that although it was shelved as horror, that they did not see it as a horror novel. Of this, Bennett has commented that he was \\"not going to write straight fantasy, or straight horror, or straight anything\\" as he viewed it as dull.  Awards  Mr. Shivers won the 2010 Shirley Jackson Award for Best Novel and the 2011 Sydney J. Bounds Award for Best Newcomer.

They comprised a doublet separated by eleven minutes, with magnitudes of 6.4 and 6.2 . At least 306 people died and more than 3,000 others were injured, primarily in the rural and mountainous areas to the northeast of Tabriz (though 45 died in the city of Ahar). The shocks were felt in Armenia and Azerbaijan, though no major damage was reported. Tectonic setting Iran lies within the complex zone of continental collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate, which extends from the Bitlis-Zagros belt in the south to the Greater Caucasus mountains, the Absheron-Balkan Sill and the Kopet Dag mountains in the north. The collision between these plates deforms an area of ~ 3,000,000 km2 of continental crust. It is one of the largest convergent deformation regions on Earth. In northwestern Iran, the Arabian Plate is moving northwards at about 20 mm per year relative to the Eurasian Plate, somewhat oblique to the plate boundary zone. The deformation in the area near Tabriz is dominated by the North Tabriz Fault, a WNW-ESE trending right-lateral strike-slip fault, which has been responsible for 7 historical earthquakes of magnitude greater than 6 since AD 858. Other known active faults include a W-E trending fault between the cities of Ahar and Heris. Earthquakes USGS ShakeMap for the mainshock The 6.4 and 6.2 intraplate earthquakes occurred as a result of oblique strike- slip faulting in the shallow crust about 300 km east of the Eurasia-Arabian Plate boundary. The two earthquakes are separated by 10 km in an east‚Äìwest direction. =Damage and casualties= Iran's state television reported the quake hit near the towns of Ahar, Heris and Varzaqan in East Azerbaijan Province at 4:53 p.m. local time (12:23 GMT). \\"268 people, 219 women and 49 men, lost their lives in hospitals\\" while the rest were killed on the spot, Iran's Health Minister Marzieh Vahid-Dastjerdi said. The Iranian minister added that 3,037 people have been injured as a result of Saturday's temblors. According to the head of Iran's Rescue and Relief Organisation, access to villages has been cut and the only communication is via radio. The worst damage and most casualties were in villages near the towns of Ahar, Varzaghan and Heris. In villages near Varzaqan, with most men away from home working, the many mud brick houses which collapsed trapped mainly women and children inside. Many villages were completely destroyed Sixty-six rescue teams were sent to the affected region, along with about 200 ambulances and five helicopters. 130 villages were 70‚Äì90% destroyed, and 20 were completely leveled. At least 45 people died and more than 500 were injured in Ahar, where electricity and phone lines were cut after the quakes. More than 40 people died in the city of Varzaqan and 50 were killed in Heris.\\"Two earthquakes in Iran kill 300 and injure 5,000\\", Ottawa Citizen The medical infrastructure in the catastrophe stricken region is not sufficient, and many heavily injured did not survive the rather long way to the nearest hospital. Most parts of Tabriz also lost electricity, and the city had a large traffic jam. Some buildings were structurally damaged. Over 200 people in Varzaqan and Ahar were extricated from under the debris of collapsed buildings, and local provincial officials asked people in the region to stay outdoors during the night because of the danger of aftershocks. Some residents needed bread, tents and drinking water. Rescue teams continued searching for survivors through the night, Iranian officials said they expected the death toll to rise. Between ten and twenty villages close to the epicenter were still cut off from aid and it would take some time to reach them. The Iranian government estimated at least 16,000 people spent the first night after the quakes in emergency shelters. A day after the quakes, more than 36,000 people had been given emergency shelter, and the Iranian government had dispatched nearly 100 ambulances, 1,100 Red Crescent workers, 44,000 food packages and 5,600 tents. According to Red Crescent officials, more than 1,000 villages were affected by the disaster, and at least 5,000 people were injured. Hospitals in the region's major cities were overcrowded and struggling to cope with the large number of people waiting for treatment. =Aftershocks= At least 80 aftershocks were felt. A 5.0 quake struck three hours later and a 5.1 aftershock struck 31 km southwest of Ahar on 12 August. On 14 August, three days after the initial quakes, another 5.1 aftershock struck the same area at a depth of 10 km. An even stronger 5.3 tremor occurred on 15 August, approximately 34 km southwest of Ahar. Reaction Iranian Red Crescent =Domestic= The East Azerbaijan province governor announced two days of public mourning in the province. Mostafa Mohammad Najjar, Minister of Interior and Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi, Minister of Health, traveled to Tabriz and Ahar. The Iranian Red Crescent did not request any international assistance. =International= In the first two days, the Iranian Red Crescent said they would not accept outside help. Three days later, the Iranian government announced it would accept foreign help. * United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's office issued a press release that read: \\"[He was] deeply saddened by the loss of hundreds of lives\\" and that the UN was ready to lend assistance and mobilize international support. The release said Ban \\"extends his sincere condolences to the Iranian government and people, particularly the families of those who have been killed or otherwise affected in this disaster.\\" * Armenian officials said the relief aid approved by Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan‚Äôs cabinet included tents, blankets, portable beds, sleeping bags, canned food and drinking water. * Azerbaijan sent an aid convoy of 25 trucks carrying 460 tents, 1,000 beds, 3,000 blankets, 20 tons of rice, 40 tons of flour and 58 tons of other food products to Ahar on 13 August. President Ilham Aliyev expressed his condolensces with regard to the earthquake. The region was visited by Azerbaijani MP Ganira Pashayeva. * The Japanese ambassador to Iran, Kinichi Komano, expressed his government's sympathy with the earthquake victims and announced Japan's readiness to provide humanitarian aid. * Pakistani President Asif Zardari and PM Raja Ashraf separately expressed condolences.

The Turkish Foreign Ministry also said it was ready to help, if the need arises. * The government of the United Arab Emirates expressed condolences and offered assistance. Temporary accommodation tents * The White House Press Secretary Jay Carney released the following statement on 12 August: \\"The American people send the Iranian people our deepest condolences for the loss of life in the tragic earthquake in northwestern Iran. Our thoughts are with the families of those who were lost, and we wish the wounded a speedy recovery. We stand ready to offer assistance in this difficult time.\\" * Pope Benedict XVI, in his Sunday Angelus at the papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, stated: \\"Dear brothers and sisters, my thoughts are, at this moment ... to those of northwestern Iran, struck by a violent earthquake. These events have resulted in many victims and injured, thousands of displaced people and extensive damage. I invite you to join in my prayers for those who have lost their lives, and for all the affected people tried by these devastating disasters.

The decision to stop the search for survivors after 24 hours was based on a government assessment that all survivors had been rescued from the rubble; an unnamed local doctor disputed the likelihood of that assessment based on the remoteness of some villages. A lack of tents for the homeless was also cited by members of the Majlis. The IRIB was criticised in an editorial in the Asr-e Iran newspaper for its perceived lack of news coverage of the earthquake. In a Majlis meeting on 13 August 2012, MPs from the affected region questioned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for not visiting the area and for not announcing public mourning.

Geography  The village is mostly situated on a southern hillside roughly North-East from the town of Popovo and South-East from the town of Razgrad, around above sea level. A tributary to the Malski (Sadinski) Lom river runs through the village. The village borders with Trustika, Miladinovtsi, Makovo, Krushno, Drinovo and Lomtsi. It is connected by tarmac roads to Popovo, Drinovo, Razgrad, Trustika, Lomtsi, and by dirt roads to Makovo and Miladinovtsi. It comprises two neighbourhoods (mahala) divided by a hill.  History  Mayor's office The first mention of the old name of the village Filibeller is in an Ottoman tax document from 1524. Nearby was an even smaller village of the same name ‚Äî Filibeller-i K√º√ß√ºk. The old village was situated in the area called Kuluka, where before 1883 were the remains of the old village mosque. According to oral tradition the founder of the village was an Ottoman from Plovdiv and the village was originally named for Filibe, the former name of Plovdiv. West of the present- day village, the remains of a settlement dating back to Ottoman times have been found. Around 1573 the village was a part of Provadia. Around 1863, it consisted of roughly 50 Ottoman houses and a mosque and housed several offices for public and official use. In 1865, 5 houses owned by Tatars and 10 houses by Circassians appeared in the village. In the village, there was an Ottoman maktab, in which the children learned how to read by studying the Quran. In Elenovo immediately before the Liberation of Bulgaria, there were 120 Ottoman houses and only one owned by Bulgarians ‚Äì the house of the blacksmith Stoyan Ivanov. In 1877, the first year of the Russo-Turkish War there were no battles around the village. Church The displacement of the Ottoman population and the appearance of Bulgarian settlers started around 1883‚Äì1885. All the settlers came from the area of Elenskia in the Balkan Mountains ‚Äì from the villages of Bagalevtsi, Buinovtsi, Velkovtsi, Ganevtsi, Gradevtsi, Gushteri, Dobrevtsi, Drenta, Kirevtsi, Novachkini, Pashovtsi, Sultani, Toduvtsi, Hunevtsi, Usoi (Sheitani), Buinovtsi (Shoevtsi) and others. One family came from the village of Kopcheliite, Gabrovo Province. Close to the end of the year 1900, there were 553 Bulgarians and only 45 Ottomans in the village. The main income of the settlers came from farming, which before 1920 they practised seasonally in Russia, Austria, Romania and the former Yugoslavia. Memorial to the Deceased for National Unity in the wars of 1912‚Äì1913 and 1915‚Äì1918 During the wars for national unity (1912‚Äì1918) twelve men from the village died on the battlefields in battles with the then-enemies of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. The first Bulgarian school in the village, which was later named for Saints Cyril and Methodius, was founded in 1886 and functioned as an elementary school until 2006. Initially the school also housed the Vuvedenie Presvetia Bogoroditsi chapel up until the village church was built in 1906‚Äì1907. On 14 August 1934, the village was renamed from Fjulbeler (–§—é–ª–±–µ–ª–µ—Ä) to Elenovo, in memory of the new settlers that came after the Liberation of Bulgaria from the area of the town of Elena. The larger Bulgarian families were: Bagaliovchani, Bairamite, Bulcherite, Gradevite, Nikolchovtsi, Novachkinovtsi, Pashovtsi, Parmukliite, Tsigularite and others. Today the inhabitants of the village are Bulgarians, Turks, Pomaks and Romani (Gypsies), and for a short period of time people from Bessarabia, although the latter have since left due to a lack of livelihood. To the present day the main means of support for the people of the village is farming and raising cattle.

It is part of a larger bog or moor complex, that lies to the south, mainly on the far side of the Germany's national border in the Czech Republic and which, since time immemorial, has been known simply as \\"The Lake\\" (Die See). The Georgenfelder Hochmoor is one of the oldest nature reserves in Saxony.  Geography  = Location = Zinnwald-Georgenfeld, which lies right on the German-Czech border, is about 45 kilometres south of Dresden and four kilometres south of Altenberg. This dispersed settlement, on the plateau at the crest of the eastern Ore Mountains, lies at an elevation of 780 to 880 metres above sea level (NN) and is the highest village in the eastern Ore Mountains. The Georgenfelder Hochmoor is part of this municipality. Former caf√© on the hochmoor = Creation = The formation of the raised bog goes back to the Elster glaciation. The maximum extent of the inland ice mass at that time reached as far as the so-called flint line (Feuersteinlinie), which, in the district of S√§chsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge runs roughly along the line Tharandt ‚Äì Rabenau ‚Äì Freital ‚Äì Kreischa ‚Äì Weesenstein ‚Äì Cottaer Spitzberg. The ridgeline in this area had a permanent covering or cap of firn. When this firn cap melted, it formed small lakes in the hollows which had no drainage. In the warm period that followed the glacial period, vegetation grew on the shores of these waters. Reeds and horsetails produced the first humus and initiated the formation of peat. Meanwhile, falling deciduous leaves, pollen and grass collected in the waters. The pollen trapped in the fen still enables today, after thousands of years, an accurate determination of the then prevailing vegetation and the climate. Georgenfelder Hochmoor The dry and warm climate period that followed allowed this reed bog to dry out. Individual trees, especially birch, colonised these nutrient-rich areas. After this period followed a cool and wet period with low levels of sunshine. The enormous rainfall raised water levels immensely, which is why peat moss species colonised very quickly and, due to their rapid growth, threatened and eventually entirely displaced the trees. Dead trees were covered in an airtight fashion by the moss. This layer is also referred to today as old forest peat (Waldtorf). The peat moss died underneath but continued to grow upwards indefinitely. This formed a thick layer of peat. The surface of this vegetation is strongly curved towards the centre, which is why it is called a raised bog. The geographic elevation of the bog has thus nothing to do with the term \\"raised bog\\", because they also occur in the lowlands. The subsequent moderately dry climatic period triggered off a new tree growth in the area and bog pines colonised the terrain. The peat mosses formed the older moss peat (Moostorf). Subsequently, the climate became cold and wet again, and mosses threatened the woodland cover. These dead trees are now referred to as the younger layer of forest peat. In our current moderately dry climate, bog pine is taking hold again. On the bare plateaux of the Ore Mountain ridgeline several bogs have formed over the course of time. These are usually also watersheds. Another bog region in the immediate vicinity is the F√ºrstenau Heath Nature Reserve.  Age and profile  Half mature moss peat forms a layer about 8 cm thick over 100 years. Mature moss peat forms a layer of 2 to 3 centimetres in the same time. The Georgenfelder Hochmoor has a thickness of about 5 meters and is thus about 10,000 years old.  Extent  The nature reserve covers about 11 hectares and is located at an elevation of 875 metres above sea level (NN). It is only the small western tip of an extensive region of bog between the mountains known as the German and Czech Lugsteins.  Conservation and research  On the initiative of the State Association for Saxon Conservation (Landesverein S√§chsischer Heimatschutz), the region was purchased in 1926 and declared a nature reserve. A school headmaster, Marschner, was especially prominent in the purchase and the botanical research of the reserve. The Saxon botanist, Court Councillor (Hofrat) A. Naumann, associate Professor of Botany at the Dresden Veterinary CollegeA. Naumann (PDF) also undertook extensive research of the Georgenfelder Hochmoor.  Access  The bog was made accessible on foot by the construction of a board walk.  Present vegetation  Due to intensive peat cutting, the water balance of the area was disturbed, resulting in the death of some plant species. Today, cranberry and bog bilberry from the North European tundra still colonise the bog. The predominant species, however, is bog pine, but some silver birch and spruce trees have also established themselves. The bog pine stems from the mountain pine of the high mountains. In the Georgenfelder Hochmoor it is usually found as a knee-high shrub, a mountain pine or a crooked pine. These forms of growth are perfectly adapted to the harsh climate of this mountain range. Blueberries, heathers and cranberries can be found on the dry terrain. The sheath cottongrass, by contrast, has colonized the wet spots. The following plants may also be found in the reserve: sedges, peat moss, cottongrass, sundew and butterwort. = Protected plants = Information board about the vegetation in the bog region * Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) * Downy birch (Betula pubescens) * Dwarf birch (Betula nana) * Peat moss (Sphagnidae) * Bilberry (Vaccinium) * Wild rosemary (Rhododendron tomentosum) * Sheathed cottonsedge (Eriophorum vaginatum) * Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium) * Round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) * Moorland spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata) * Cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) * Bog bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) * Cranberry * Heather * Marsh violet, (Viola palustris) * Moor grass (Molinia) * Arctic starflower (Trientalis europaea) * Few-flowered sedge (Carex pauciflora)  Literature  * A.

They consist most often of ivory. Delporte writes of 29 figurines altogether.See Delporte (1979), p. 197. They are about 20,000 years old and stem from the Gravettian.See Cohen (2003), p. 113. Most of these statuettes show stylized clothes. Quite often the face is depicted. They were discovered at Mal'ta, at the Angara River, near Lake Baikal in Irkutsk Oblast, Siberia by the archeologists Sergey Zamyatnin, Georgy Sosnovsky, and Mikhail Gerasimov.See. Delporte (1979), p. 193. These figurines are on display at the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg. Discovery Around 30 female statuettes of varying shapes were discovered at Mal'ta, at the Angara River, and near Lake Baikal in Irkutsk Oblast in Siberia. The wide variety of forms, combined with the realism of the sculptures and the lack of repetitiveness in detail, are definite signs of developed, albeit early, art. Until the Mal‚Äôta find, Venus figurines were previously found only in Europe. Carved from the tusk ivory of a mammoth, these images were typically highly stylized and often involved embellished and disproportionate characteristics (typically the breasts or buttocks). Features At first glance what is obvious is that the Mal'ta Venus figurines are of two types: full-figured women with exaggerated forms, and women with a thin, delicate form. Some of the figures are nude while others have etchings that seem to indicate fur or clothing. Conversely, unlike those found in Europe, some of the Venus figurines from Mal‚Äôta were sculpted with faces. Most of the figurines were tapered at the bottom, and it is believed that this was done so they could have been stuck into the ground or placed upright some other way. Placed upright they could have symbolized the spirits of the dead, akin to \\"spirit dolls\\" used nearly world-wide, including Siberia, among contemporary people. Style The suggested similarity between Mal'ta and Upper Paleolithic civilizations of Western and Eastern Europe coincides with a long-held belief that the ancient people of Mal'ta were related to the Paleolithic societies of Europe. These similarities can be established by their tools, dwelling structures, and art. These commonalities draw into question the origin of Upper Paleolithic Siberian people, and whether the migrating peoples originated from Southeastern Asia or quite possibly from Europe. On the other hand, one can argue that as a group the Mal'ta Venus figures are rather different from the female figurines of Western and Central Europe. For example, none of the Siberian specimens indicates abdominal enlargement as main European examples do, and as breasts are often lacking, few offer clear enough evidence of gender to define them as female. More conclusively, nearly half of them show some facial details, something which is lacking on the so-called Venus figures of Europe.

The D voters are determined by special tribunals under the Foreigners Act, and the person declared as D voter is not given the elector's photo identity card. In 2011, the Gauhati High Court ordered the D voters to be transferred to Foreigners Tribunals set up under Foreigners Tribunal Order 1964 and be kept in detention camps. The Bengali Hindus who migrated from East Pakistan and Bangladesh before and after 1971 and Bengali Muslims in Assam affected by this categorization. According to Sudip Sarma, the publicity secretary of the Assam unit of the Nikhil Bharat Bangali Udbastu Samanway Samiti, there are 6 lakh Bengali Hindu D voters in the state.  History  On 17 July 1997, the Election Commission of India, issued a circular to the Government of Assam directing it to remove non-citizens from the electoral list. Following that, an intensive revision of electoral rolls began in Assam, involving door to door survey in order to enlist only genuine Indian citizens. The persons who could not provide evidence in favour of their Indian nationality were marked with D in the electoral rolls, to indicated doubtful or disputed status of their Indian nationality. During the survey, the absentee voters too were marked with D. Around 370,000 persons were thus declared as D voters by the Election Commission of India. The persons marked as D voters were barred from contesting the elections and casting their votes. The Election Commission of India further directed the D voters to be put on trial before the Foreigners Tribunals set up under the Foreigner (Tribunal) Order of 1964. Out of an estimated 370,000, only 199,631 cases were referred to the tribunals for verification. During the initial trials 3,686 persons were found to be foreigners, who names were removed from the electoral rolls. The trials at the 36 Foreigners Tribunals proceeded at a slow pace. Meanwhile, a section of the Bangladeshi illegal immigrants who were marked as D voters and awaiting the trials became absconding. In view of this, on 4 April 2004, the Gauhati High Court ordered the D voters to be sent to detention camps till their cases were disposed of. Accordingly, the D voters facing trial before the Foreigners Tribunal were sent to the detention camps at Goalpara and Kokrajhar. In 2005, another door to door survey was carried out of the Election Commission. During the survey it was found that a huge number of D voters, who were blacklisted in 1997, could not be traced. The number of D voters was officially revised to 181,619. As of June 2012, there were officially 157,465 D voters in Assam, whose credentials are under verification. On 6 January 2014, the State Government informed the Legislature that there were a total of 143,227 D voters in the state.  Human rights issues  In July 2011, two middle aged ethnic Bengali Hindus, brothers Santosh Shabdakar and Manotosh Shabdakar, D voters from Tempur Paikan under Algapur constituency in Hailakandi district were declared as Bangladeshi citizens by the Foreigners Tribunal. The brothers, rickshaw pullers by profession, were born in Tarapur locality of Silchar in Cachar district. They had exercised their voting rights in the past but were declared as D voters before the 2011 assembly elections. After the verdict, they were arrested by the Hailakandi police who handed them over to BSF in Karimganj. On the midnight of 12 July 2011, the BSF took them to Mahishashan border and pushed them into Bangladesh. Since then the Shabdakar brothers could not be traced. In March 2012, Assam Accord implementation minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the Government of Assam would constitute a committee to look into the cases of Bengali Hindu D voters in the state. The Government of Assam would also ensure that the police doesn't harass the Bengali Hindus in name of being D voters. Even after assurance by the minister, the hunt for D voters continued in the Barak Valley. On 8 June 2012, Arjun Namasudra, an ethnic Bengali Hindu from Cachar District committed suicide after being declared a D voter.

Presented in the \\"found footage\\" style, the film stars Rufus Hound, Lucy Punch and Robert Webb. It follows an engaged couple's best man as he creates a video documentary of their wedding.  Plot  Raif Moyle (Hound) has been chosen to be the best man to his brother Tim (Webb) and Saskia (Punch) at their wedding. Raif decides to give Tim and Saskia an unforgettable present in the form of a wedding video. He discovers that Tim has left his bohemian life behind and is marrying into a family aspirant of a higher-class lifestyle‚Äîespecially Saskia's hideous Hyacinth Bucket-esque grandmother (Miriam Margolyes). With the bride's mother interfering with wedding plans (such as arranging horses dressed as unicorns and butterflies to release by the bridesmaids), Raif finds out that Saskia is the rebellious Saskia he knew at school. Spending an increasing amount of time with her during the wedding arrangements, Raif and Saskia kiss after the stress of the planning takes its toll on her. Eventually revealing this to Tim en route to the wedding, they decide to intercept Saskia on her way to the church. Tim asks Saskia whether she really wants the marriage to go ahead; she tearfully says \\"no\\". Arriving late to the church, the three make their way up the aisle to the altar, where Tim announces that his and Saskia's wedding will not proceed. However, Raif steps forward and the vicar conducts a brief, but non- legal, ceremony for Raif and Saskia. At the wedding reception, being held at a grand stately home (the real-life Basildon Park), Saskia's mother realises that all she wants is for Saskia to be happy.

Joey Godman, writing for The Upcoming, gave the film 1/5 stars, stating that the plot was simplistic and the jokes \\"predictable\\". He praised Hound's realism and the film's easy viewing, but thought that the plot's climax was detached from the majority of the film. The Guardian wrote the film was \\"moderately funny\\", and described Margolyes' and Harriet Walter's characters as \\"sharp and credible\\". In a review for The Independent, Nicholas Barber stated that the upsets and mayhem in the film are \\"small beer\\" compared to those in Peep Show, The Worst Week of My Life and Gavin & Stacey.

The series follows Sakura Mamiya, a girl who gained the power to see ghosts after an incident as a child, and her classmate Rinne Rokudo, a boy of mixed human and shinigami heritage who helps lingering spirits finally pass on to be reincarnated.  Protagonists  ; : (commercial), Kaito Ishikawa (anime) :Rinne Rokudo is the main character of the story, a red-haired first-year high school boy of mixed human and shinigami heritage. He used to live with his grandparents until his human grandfather died, moving to reside in the human world instead despite his grandmother Tamako's protests. Due to his father Sabato's criminal activities, Rinne had his money stolen by him and out of poverty, lives in an abandoned club building of the school he attends. He performs the duties of a shinigami, but due to his human blood often requires extra tools to aid him, which are often quite expensive. The only costly shinigami item he owns is the famed , a robe that allows Rinne to not be seen by ordinary living beings and, when worn by a ghost inside out, turns a ghost into a solid being. Rinne's name is taken from \\"Rinne\\", the cycle of resurrection present in Buddhism, and Rokudo, the six paths that comprise it. :Upon meeting Sakura, she becomes his first human friend and develops strong feelings for her as the story progresses. The story eventually becomes more focused on Rinne in the later parts of the story, whereas Sakura takes on a more passive role. He is often protective of her, and places her best interests above his own. Rinne dislikes Tsubasa due to his violent ways of exorcising ghosts and competition for Sakura's affection with him, is also often annoyed with Ageha as she constantly tries to win his affection using various methods of trickery and manipulation, and especially hates his father whose greed and dishonesty goes against everything Rinne believes in. He resembles Sabato greatly apart from a slight difference in hair colour. ; : (commercial), Marina Inoue (anime) :Sakura Mamiya is the narrator and heroine of the story, a first-year high school student characterized by her signature twin braids. Unlike normal humans, she has extrasensory perception, which was caused from a time where she was spirited away to the ghost world as a little girl, although she came back with the help of a Shinigami named Tamako. She is known for being very calm, quiet, and not expressive of her emotions. As the story progresses, it is hinted that Sakura develops feelings for Rinne, but doesn't show it. Even though she is usually calm and collected, Sakura does have a jealous side that rarely makes an appearance. She is completely unaware of Tsubasa and Rinne's affections towards her and just focuses on helping when she can or doing what is right. ; : (commercial), Hitomi Nabatame (anime) :Rokumon is a black cat by contract. These cats form contracts with shinigami, aiding them in their job, eliminating evil spirits, but also bringing curses, threats, and ill omens. His appearance is that of a little black cat with a human face, changing into a demonic giant cat face to scare off humans. He can also transform into a cute faced kitten, and often does so in order to get food. He comes to the living world appearing as a demon cat, who scares Rinne and Sakura's classmates. He claims to have been sent by Tamako to form a contract with Rinne, to which the boy refuses, having no resources to support the helper. He then appears to Sakura and reveals to her the true reason of Rinne's shinigami duties, while Rinne finds a letter, discovering the truth about him: Tamako fired him and he came looking for Rinne's support. Eventually, the two form a contract, on the grounds that Rokumon covers his own living expenses. He does not seem to favor Tsubasa.  Family  ; : :Tamako is Rinne's paternal grandmother, a young looking shinigami. She becomes upset when Rinne or other characters referred to as \\"grandmother\\", instead insisting on being called \\"young lady\\". Fifty years before, she came to claim the soul of a young man in agony, with whom she quickly fell in love. She made a deal with the death priest who married them, promising to do ten times the usual shinigami chores in exchange for extending his life fifty years. Should she fail, her descendants would take on her burden. Ten years ago, she saved Sakura from a Damashigami who brought her to the otherworld, but accepted to buy her a candy before sending her back to the living world, which caused her to become able to see ghosts. After her husband's time came to go to the Wheel of Reincarnation, she lost her right to live in the living world, and her grandson refused to live with her. She nevertheless would support her grandson. She has a black cat named Kuroboshi. ; : :Sabato Rokudo is Rinne's father and Tamako's only son. While Rinne was living with his grandparents, Sabato would often sneak into his son's room to steal money from the boy's piggybank, and take out large debts in his son's name by using forged stamps or other methods. Sabato is the president of the Damashigami Company, an illegal business committed to stealing the souls of people who have not ended their lifespan. Rinne finds this practice of his father's disgusting, and wants to bring down his father's company. In addition to his habit of playing the spendthrift with other people's money, Sabato also has a great love of women. He has dozens of different women interested in him, yet he holds a special place in his heart for Ageha's sister, who works as his secretary. Sabato uses dirty tricks in attempts to force Rinne to take over the Damashigami Company so that he can one day retire. ; : :Mrs. Mamiya is Sakura's mother, a cheerful woman, known to get carried away when cooking and makes/buys too much food. She always stays at home as a housewife while her husband works at a bank, and she‚Äôs unaware of her daughter‚Äôs ability to see ghosts. She was a student of Sankai High School like her daughter, and a member of the Broadcasting club with an old friend named Otobe who had a crush on her. ; : : Otome Rokud≈ç is a high-ranking shinigami who is Rinne's mother. She had been missing for many years because she was accidentally pushed into the Wheel of Reincarnation when she tried to get rid of something, and reincarnated, first into a fish, then a canary, then anteater before becoming an elementary school girl named Ichigo.  Humans  ; : :Miho is a classmate and friend of Sakura and Rika, and also the student council secretary. She has great interest in scary stories, though she‚Äôs a scaredy cat like Rika. ; : :Rika is Sakura and Miho's superstitious friend. At some occasions, she finds herself mixed up in a haunting through no fault of her own. Her first brush with the occult comes when she inherited a haunted phone number that has been floating around for many years. Her last name is revealed in the anime to be Momoi (Ê°É‰∫ï). ; : :Tsubasa Jumonji comes from a family of exorcists. Like Sakura, he can also see ghosts, but often brutally attacks them with \\"sacred ashes\\" instead of trying to put them to rest, which can serve to turn them into evil spirits. He initially met Sakura when they were in younger and he began to harbor feelings for her after he realized that she can see ghosts as well. Since his transfer into Sakura's high school, he has tried countless times for Sakura to return his affection and is jealous of the time she and Rinne have spent together, and thus begins joining them on their ghost exploits. Since joining them, he has realized that not all ghosts are evil and has been more lenient towards some. He tends to jump to conclusions, especially when something concerns Rinne and Sakura's relationship. It is hinted that he is Christian. ; :Ayame Sakaki is a seemingly meek girl who works at a local shrine. When she was in middle school, Ayame took interest in Tsubasa when he got transferred, as they are on the same business, and hoped to get to know him. But he moved away because of his fathers‚Äô job, before she was able to, and a powerful vengeful spirit emerged from her, beyond her own control. Upon encountering Tsubasa again, Ayame rekindles her former interest in him, and Tsubasa accepts to date her to calm her vengeful spirit and make it come back to her body. Her spirit would however go on the loose again many times since she still doesn't have full control of it and she and Tsubasa don't meet very often, and she hopes for another date with Tsubasa, but since he still remains fixed on Sakura, he avoids being alone with her, by having Rinne and Sakura along. ; : : Hitomi Annette Anematsuri is a homeroom assistant schoolteacher in possession of the Peep Ball, a special shinigami tool that can let her peek into peoples' past or future. As it is a valuable lost Shinigami tool, it would be targeted by many, including Sabato, Kain and Masato, but she is not bent on handing it over, and her constant accurate predictions and Rinne's help allows her to always keep it. Annette is descended from a witch of Medieval France, and her French grandmother met a Japanese tourist who would become her grandfather, and they moved to Japan. Her grandmother and mother tend to be absent at home, always going to the hot springs, and upon returning home, her grandmother would hit her granddaughter in the head whenever she does something wrong.  Non-humans  ; : :Masato is a wealthy devil that wants to seek revenge against Rinne. He hates him because during his time at Demon Elementary School, he was given a homework assignment to retrieve a soul and bring it to Hell: a rabbit that was soon going to die from loneliness. Just as he was about to take the still living rabbit's soul, Rinne fed the animal, causing its spirit to return, and ruining Masato's assignment. Enraged, the devil attempted to attack the shinigami with a pitchfork, but Rinne smashed him over the head with a large crucifix, thus beginning their long-running rivalry. Masato often resorts to using his vast fortune as an advantage over the impoverished Rinne, but despite his wealth, his astuteness seems to be a bit lacking. He is a poor speller, often miswriting kanji, and his carefully laid traps are childish and easy to see through. Due to these weaknesses, his plans usually backfire on him. ; : :Ageha is a young shinigami of a wealthy and respected family. She meets Rinne while investigating the Damashigami company, and unexpectedly, begins to have feelings for him after spending some time with him, and much to her disappointment, finds out that her sister willingly joined the Damashigami company for she fell in love with Rinne's father. She would keep trying to win Rinne‚Äôs affection many times in various ways, and still hunt Damashigamis although her attention for Rinne became her top priority. She is often shown to be jealous of Sakura, because she believes Sakura and Rinne have feelings for each other, though Sakura is initially jealous of her when she believes that Ageha and Rinne are dating. Ageha and Renge also have disputes, back in grade school Ageha's overzealousness and stupidity often caused problems for pragmatic Renge. She hates it when her sister's betrayal is brought up, shown when she first meets Kain who insults her, and she meets Renge again who brings it up. She has a black cat named Oboro. ; : :Bijin is Ageha's older sister and secretary of the Damashigami Company. A year before the series starts, she worked as a shinigami like her younger sister, vowing to bring down the Damashigami Company. Then, she disappears and sends her sister a postcard, saying that she now has a boyfriend, Sabato Rokudo. Even though he is a ladies' man, she seems to be his favorite. After Ageha uncovers her work as a Damashigami, their relationship becomes more strained because Bijin decides to stay at Sabato's side while leaving Ageha feeling hurt and betrayed by her sister. ; : :Kain is a shirushigami, an accountant in the afterlife. His main responsibility is to keep track of the lifespan of humans on Earth. When Kain was a boy, his mother found herself courted by Sabato Rokudo, Rinne's father, who constantly borrowed money from her, thereby leaving her and her son to live on the verge of bankruptcy. Kain's mother naively believes Sabato to be a good man, but her money has provided the financial backing for his illegal business. Kain doesn't want anyone finding out about his family's connection to the crime group. Because no part of his job requires him to take part in field work of any kind, he is forced to work in secrecy, covertly hunting damashigamis in hopes of destroying the Damashigami Company. Because Sabato habitually uses the name-seal, or hanko, of his son to sign loan contracts, Kain is the main creditor of Rinne and develops a grudge against him. At his first appearance, the shirushigami shows little regard for justice when he attempts to seize Rinne's life-flame to cover Sabato's debts. Furthermore, he shows no remorse when an innocent human bystander like Sakura gets caught up in their battle, even though saying he would get punished for an innocent's death. Although he considers Rinne as guilty as his father, he would sometimes cooperate with Rinne for different reasons including arresting Sabato. He always cared for Renge, however, and even stated that he wished for Renge to follow his dream of getting a better life, e.g. going to the Shinigami Elite High School. He doesn't know that she works as a Damashigami and Renge tries her hardest to keep it a secret. He has a black cat named Suzu. ; : :Shoma is a shinigami grade schooler from a wealthy family. At his first appearance, he paired with Rinne who is supposed to serve as a mentor during their training. He even lives with Rinne for the assignment. However due to Rinne's poverty, he looks down on him, complaining all the while and ignoring Rinne's advice. He is a bit of a glory hound and overestimates his abilities, despite being very inexperienced and even behind his classmates in his achievements. Thus, he takes on too big a task and causes more problems for spirits and his mentor than he actually solves. Furthermore, he is shown to be easily bored and cheeky, e.g. painting his black cat. Later, he meets Ichigo and falls in love with her, unaware that she is the reincarnation of Rinne's mother. He has a black cat named Kurosu. ; : :Refuto is the fourth generation master of the Crescent Moon Shop (‰∏âÊó•ÊúàÂ†Ç Mikazukido), which has been in business for 4000 years in scythe sharpening, and the youngest twin of Raito. Because of his inexperience and bad mouth, the shop has fallen on hard times, both he and his twin sister are desperate for customers, and rely on Rinne's help, but their new products mostly end discontinued and their business sometimes end in suspension. ; : :Raito is the business manager of the Crescent Moon Shop, and the eldest twin of Refuto. She lured Rinne to the store and convinced him to let her brother sharp his Scythe in hope of increasing their reputation and keeping their business going. She and Refuto would still try to come up with ways to make their business thrive, and would still make contact with Rinne to either sell him or ask him to try new products. Though she means well, she is shrewd, going as far as tricking and forcing Rinne to do something for their profit; and seizing any profitable opportunity. ; : :Renge Shima is a new transfer student at Rinne's school, but she is also a Damashigami. When she is introduced, she attempts to steal the souls of boys at their school by using a Marilyn Monroe spirit. She captures Sakura and over a cup of tea tells her that she didn't have female friends because of her seductive ways. While walking to the admission exam of the Shinigami Elite High School, she was knocked into the Sanzu river by Sabato while running from a restaurant without paying. Because of that, she missed the entrance exam and as compromise got into the Damashigami High School for Girls, which is why she holds a grudge against her boss. Still, it doesn't stop her from working for him to earn more money due to her poverty. Renge hates Ageha for the problems the airhead had caused her back in grade school and isn't above using whatever she can to get revenge on her. She also has a considerable, but one-sided crush on Kain that dates back to her middle school years. On his graduation day, she tried to give him a love letter that wished him good luck at the Life Count Administration Bureau. However, she was unable to because of a swarm of girls who also wanted to give him gifts. Renge fears of what would happen if Kain knew she is a Damashigami and does her best to keep it a secret, even going so far as to hit Kain on the back of his head to keep him from hearing Sabato casually greet her as an accomplice or working with Rinne to keep her secret. However, Kain heard a rumor that because of Renge had missed her entrance exam and she was unable to make it up but he chose not to believe it. Even so, Kain seems content to keep things as they are between them. She causes problems for Rinne and his friends but mainly for Rinne who is now her next-door neighbor in the abandoned club house. She has an elderly black cat named Tama. ; : :Matsugo is a former elementary school classmate of Rinne's from a wealthy family. Now, he attends Shinigami Elite High School (the school that Kain and Renge longed to). When Rinne and him met again at the elementary school reunion, he resented Rinne strongly because he believed Rinne almost drowned him in a river on a field trip. When it turns out Rinne only saved him from humiliation, Matsugo's attitude makes a U-turn, declaring that he loves Rinne. Furthermore, he denies he is \\"that way\\" but Tsubasa and Sakura do not quite believe him. Like Ageha, he goes to great lengths to spend time with his friend, much to Rinne's annoyance, even using similar methods like the female shinigami, and due to their similar crush on Rinne, the two don't get along very well. His black cat is called Kuromitsu. ; : :Anju is Matsugo's classmate and attends the Shinigami Elite High School. She has a big crush on Matsugo but is way too shy to talk to him, and sadly for her, Matsugo is indifferent to her. She does not have a black cat.  Black cats  ; : :Oboro is Ageha's black cat by contract. Oboro's family had served Ageha's family for many years and he is continuing that tradition, much to his own chagrin. During their first mission together the two started to argue and Ageha buried him under a boulder where he remained trapped for a year before being able to dig his way out. Even though Ageha and Oboro grew-up together, neither of them can stand each other. Ageha treated him poorly as a child which sparked his long standing grudge against her. Oboro mistakenly thought he could take revenge against his employer, but Ageha still retains her signed contract that ensures he cannot stop serving as her retainer. Ageha does not like Oboro any more than he likes her, but she chooses to keep him out of spite. In the course of the story, they start to get along better, while never ceasing in their fights. ; : :Suzu is Kain's black cat. One day while in town, Kain came across her, holding a sign that she was up for adoption for a free price. Due to his family's financial status, Kain took her in. Suzu is very loyal to her master despite having a surly attitude towards others. She looks down on Rinne and Rokumon for being poor, despite hers and Kain's own impoverished state. Still, she is hinted to develop a friendship of sorts with Oboro and Rokumon. Her personality is fairly easy-going though somewhat excitable due to her young age. Additionally, she is never full as she is shown to eat a lot on various occasions. Suzu is doted on by Kain's mother. ; : :Kurosu is Shouma's black cat who works strictly from nine to five. He stated he couldn't stand working any longer than that because he doesn't like children. While on the job, he is patient with his master and even does most of the work for him. He is of a high rank, capable of using illusory cat magic. He thinks of Rokumon as a promising black cat, e.g. complimenting him on Rokumon's test. ; : :Tama is Renge's black cat. ; : :Kuromitsu is Matsugo's black cat. She is very loyal to her master, supporting him in his numerous attempts to be alone with Rinne and \\"deepen their friendship\\". ; : :Kuroboshi is Tamako's black cat. After being stuck in her master's closet for a time when she had to move back to the otherworld after her husband's time came, he wishes to retire and have his grandson take his place. ; : :Kuroboshi III is Kuroboshi's grandson, who hopes to follow his grandfather's footsteps as Tamako's black cat. However, he has a great fear for ghosts and so can't form a contract until he overcomes his phobia.

Role The main role of Architech is to manage the welfare of the UTM architecture students, organize events of various forms for the benefits of its members, to become the voice of the students in the school, and ultimately to ensure the advancement of non-academic qualities amongst its members. Logo The Architech logo was a result of a design competition held by the association in 1992, initiated by the president at the time, Zulhisham and Che Wan Ahmad Faizal. At the time, the name Architech have not come into being, and the logo competition was actually for PSUTM. The prize advertised was RM200, however the participations were poor and uninspiring (less than 20 entries), hence no winner was picked. Instead, Che Wan Ahmad Faizal then approached Fauzee Nasir to design a logo worthy for the association. Using Aldus Freehand 2.0. on a classic Mac, Fauzee designed the logo, incorporating the name Architech for the first time. This was the first instance of the name in use. The logo and the name Architech was accepted by the general population, and remains in use until now. =Description= The logo utilizes simple and straightforward typography, using Times New Roman, beginning with a capital A and with italic type applied to the last four letters. The letters \\"Archi\\" will normally be black on white/light background, or white on black/dark background. The letters \\"tech\\" will normally be red, or gray in monochrome print. =Rights and Ownership= The Architech logo was designed and still owned by Fauzee Nasir until today. In a deal struck with the association, the association agreed not to pay the RM200 prize money to Fauzee Nasir as the design was not part of the competition. Hence, the designer retains ownership and rights to the logo. However, in a mutual agreement the designer gave right to use and reproduce the logo as long as it is not for commercial use. Any commercial use must have written permission from the designer. Student Composition Architech members consist of the entire population of architecture students in UTM, as students enrolled in the programme are automatically registered under it unless otherwise requested. Previously it also included students of landscape architecture until they formed their own students society in the late 1990s. When the diploma programme was shifted to UTM KL campus under the Razak School, the diploma students formed their own society called ARCO, which was intended as a sister society to Architech. However, due to logistics problem, especially since both are now under two different schools, ARCO became an independent body, but maintained close relations with Architech. =Sub-communities= Below is the list of students batches and name.http://www.tanggam.com/v4/forum/index.php?board=40.0 List of Subcommunities in Tanggam (Due to the various intake positions in the programme, it made more sense to list the batches according to their respective graduation year, instead of intake year). * 1993 - UTM87/88 * 1994 - Batch88/89 * 1995 - Archi890 * 1996 - HUHA901 * 1997 - Aesthete912 * 1998 - Nocturnal (formerly A'droid) * 1999 - Genesis * 2000 - Altruist * 2001 - Kaiser (formerly ArchiKaiser) * 2002 - VSixth (formerly X-stag) * 2003 - Virtuoso * 2004 - Enam Tahun * 2005 - Monochrome * 2006 - Rhythm of Architecture (also known as RoAR) * 2007 - Prodigy * 2008 - Inverto (last batch of 3+3 year programme) * 2008 - Frenzy (first batch of 5 year programme) * 2009 - Chronicles * 2010 - Oracle * 2011 - Strano * 2012 - Eureka * 2013 - Pyro * 2014 - Vitruvius (also known as Vitro) - (last batch of 5-year programme) Beyond this the programme has been restructured into a 3-year (instead of 5 year) programme. It has not been decided on how or what convention to use for the 2-year M.Arch programme at this moment, particularly since it has two intakes per year (effectively two graduating batches annually as well). * 2013 - Sueno (first batch of 3 year programme) * 2014 - AKAR * 2015 - Sectatio * 2016 - Rhapsody * 2017 - JEBAT * 2018 - Eminent * 2019 - Magna * 2020 - Dexter * 2021 - Artem * 2022 - Axtella Structure =Top Committee= Architech is led by its president, democratically elected amongst its members for a term of one year. The president is assisted by the vice president, secretary and treasurer, all of which are democratically elected as well. Together, they will form their government, electing individuals of various skills into official positions where their skills could be harnessed for the benefit of the society. These positions evolve and vary throughout the years to meet any needs. Some example of the positions over the years are: * Technical - in charge of management of technical aspects, such as asset, equipment and facilities management. * Graphics - in charge of spearheading the graphical movement and activities. * Sports - in charge of sporting events, be it competitive or recreational. * Insaniah - in charge of spiritual development amongst its members, normally for the Muslim community. * Website - in charge of development and maintenance of Architech's online presence (Blog, Forum, Facebook etc.) =Leadership= The list of Presidents are as follows, according to year and batch. * 1983 - Melvin Yeo Kiandi * 1984 - Nur Fadillah Mufti * 1985 - Sahul * 1986 - Wahid * 1988 - Rosli * 1989 - Mohamad Faisal Talha - served for one and a half terms * 1992 - Zulhisham * 1998 - Mohd Yusri Mohd Ripin (Altruist) * 1999 - Ismahadi Ismail (Kaiser) - served without vice president * 2000 - Mohd Zamzam Siran (VSixth)- served for half term, replaced by Fawwaz for the remaining term * 2002 - Mohd Azmi Shukor * 2003 - Shah * 2004 - Mariana Isa (Enam Tahun) - first female president * 2005 - Hazazi Hamzah (Prodigy) * 2006 - Aiman Rashid (Inverto) - served for one and a half terms * 2007 - Taufiq Azmi (Chronicle) * 2008 - Fakhruz Zaman (Oracle) * 2009 - Khairool Aizat (Strano) * 2010 - Muhammad Amin (Eureka) * 2011 - Azizaini Juhaidi (Pyro) * 2012 - Muhammad Haiqal Rosli (Vitruvius) * 2013 - Mohd Safwan Saifuddin (Sueno) * 2014 - Dzikri Rashid (Akar) * 2015 - Muhammad Fikry bin Hasbullah (Sectatio) * 2016 - Dani Aizat bin Lokman (Rhapsody) * 2017 - Muhammad Nasrul Anis (Jebat) * 2018 - Aizat Anuar (Eminent) * 2019 - Muhammad Hazique (Eminent) - was also parts of Magna batch, intake 2015 * 2020 - Muhammad Alfajri Bin Candrapitaet (Dexter) Publications =Architext= Architext was initiated as a periodical newsletter for Architech. It started around 1997, led by Roshida Majid and advised by Dr. Mohd Tajuddin Mohd Rasdi. Copies of the first two issues were lost; #3 was the earliest remaining copy today. It was distributed free bilingually in Bahasa Malaysia and English, featured several articles relating to architectural studies, listed events and activities, as well as a cartoon sketch. Architext was never resumed and was presumably forgotten, until recently some of its original members began discussing of bringing it back. =Design Folio= The Design Folio is a publication collecting selected students' thesis works from a particular year. It is published with the notion of showcasing works based on specific theme for each publication. Students works are then selected based on the theme, ideally spanning between three and five years of thesis works. However, in its two innumeration, the selection is limited within a group of students in a particular year. The publication is intended for commercial publications. The editorial consists of entirely students from the thesis group, advised and consulted by the Thesis Coordinators. To date, there have been two successful publications: the first in 2005 and the second in 2007. There was another manuscript managed to be completed in 2008, however due to funding limitations, it did not get published. =Design Thesis Synopsis= 1997 Architectural Design Thesis. Anthem The association have adopted a song written by one of the students in the late 80s, Zuhairi Harun. The song was titled 'Warisan', touching on the struggle of heritage and identity of architecture in Malaysia. The song have gone through a number of renditions, including quickening of tempo and change of melody, however the spirit of the song remains. Activities =Architectural Workshop= The architectural workshop is an annual national gatherings of architectural students in Malaysia. It began in 1987 in UTM, using the format of a jamboree, organised by Persatuan Arkitek (Architech) in Kuala Lumpur. Concurrently during the workshop, the PAM-Education Liaison Meeting would also take place to take advantage of the gatherings of students from various schools in one location. Architech was the pioneer of the architectural workshop, which exists until today. The last architectural workshop hosted by Architech was in June 2011 using the theme \\"Terang\\". It was the biggest architectural workshop ever hosted by Architech, involving over 24 schools of architecture from all over Malaysia. It was officiated by PAM Vice President Ar. Saifuddin Ahmad. One of the outcome of the module was street furnitures, which became a feature in Jalan Wong Ah Fook, Johor Bahru. Over 20 sculptures were displayed and used by the public for a period of several days. At the moment, it is undecided on when the next hosting by Architech will be, but it is estimated around 2016.

Coats, Jr. (born May 19, 1942 in Bakersfield, Calif.), is an economist specializing in monetary policy. He retired from the International Monetary Fund in May 2003 to join the board of directors of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. He is president of Economic Consulting, providing technical assistance to central banks, and until recently was adviser to the central banks of Afghanistan (for the IMF) and Kazakhstan (for the government of Kazakhstan). Early life Coats was born and raised in Bakersfield, California, where he graduated from Bakersfield High School in 1960 in absentia while spending his senior year abroad with the International Christian Youth Exchange in the German village of Rasdorf. While in Germany he lived with the family of Albert Martin for a year and attended the Gymnasium in H√ºnfeld near Fulda. From 1960 to 1962, Coats attended Bakersfield College, where he co-founded and edited the Weekly Blatt,http://www2.bc.cc.ca.us/bcarchive/content/03/V/04/a/(02)/03-V-04-a-(02)--V7-1.pdf an underground weekly campus newspaper dedicated to presenting conservative and libertarian political perspectives on current events. During 1962‚Äì66 Coats attended the University of California at Berkeley and received a B.A. in Economics in June 1966. At Berkeley, he served as president of several organizations, including the University Young Republicans (UYR), the University Conservatives, and his fraternity, Alpha Tau Omega. As president of the UYR, he was a member of the Free Speech Movement coordinating committee and allied with the presidents of the University Young Democrats, University Conservatives, and the Young People's Socialist League in an effort to restore free speech to the campus without violence. In 1966‚Äì70 Coats studied economics at the University of Chicago. His doctoral dissertation was on The September 1968 Changes in 'Regulation D' and Their Implications for Monetary Supply Control, with Milton Friedman heading his dissertation committee. His Ph.D was granted in 1972. While studying at Chicago, Coats taught part-time at the Illinois Institute of Technology (1966‚Äì1967 and 1968‚Äì1970). In 1968 he took a leave of absence to join Louise Wilkinson at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, where both were assistant professors. They married in Hawaii before returning to Chicago to resume their graduate studies. Coats has several children and grandchildren. His partner for the last 20+ years is Dr Ito Briones, a physician an artist. Career Coats was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Virginia from 1970‚Äì75 and assistant chairman of the economics department in 1975. He joined the IMF at the beginning of 1976 and became chief of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) division in the finance department in 1983. He is author of two books and editor or co-editor of three books on money and banking topics and more than two dozen articles on the SDR and other monetary topics. In January 1992, Coats rejoined what is now the Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM) in the IMF to lead a technical assistance mission to Bulgaria followed by back-to-back missions to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. His career focused on an intensive program of developing new central banks and currencies that lasted beyond his retirement. He has led more than 70 missions that have provided practical advice and assistance to central banks around the globe often under crisis conditions. These include missions to Afghanistan, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary, Iraq, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Malta, Moldova, Nigeria, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Sudan, Turkey, the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He supervised the establishment of new central banks in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the reestablishment, transformation, and development of the payment and banking systems in Kosovo, and helped Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and later Bosnia and Herzegovina and South Sudan introduce their own currencies. Coats‚Äô work on banking sector issues in Moldova, Bulgaria, Croatia, Turkey and Yugoslavia has provided him with the practical experience reflected in his several articles on banking sector soundness issues (including several papers on Bank Insolvency Law). He has also written on various monetary theory and policy issues, including digital money and inflation targeting. He edited a book on Inflation Targeting in Transition Economies published by the IMF and the Czech National Bank and co- edited a book on the same subject published by the Czech National Bank in 2003. The difficult negotiations he led for the IMF to establish a new central bank following the end of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina are chronicled in his book, One Currency for Bosnia: Creating the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, published in August, 2007, by Jameson Books. Coats‚Äô monetary advice has not always been trouble free. At a widely attended press conference in Kabul in January 2002, Coats was asked by Mark Landler, a New York Times reporter whether the IMF was recommending that Afghanistan replace the existing currency with U.S. dollars. He responded that dollarization was one of the options under consideration. When he failed to explain that if the policy to dollarize were adopted then the existing currency would be redeemed for dollars, the Afghani immediately depreciated about 25%. The next day acting central bank governor Abdul Fitrat detailed more fully how the adoption of dollarization (which was rejected in any event), would work and the exchange rate recovered fully within a day. At the time he retired from the IMF in May, 2003, to become a Director of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA), Coats was the Assistant Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM). Coats was a visiting economist at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 1979 and was seconded to the World Bank for one year to help write the 1989 World Development Report on the Financial System. Following his IMF retirement, he continued providing technical assistance to central banks as a consultant with the IMF, BearingPoint, the Asian Development Bank, the U.S. Treasury, Overseas Development Institute, and Deloitte Consulting. His consulting assignments have included Afghanistan, Albania, Iraq, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Yemen, and South Sudan. Coats is a member of Alpha Tau Omega (past president of Berkeley chapter), American Economic Association, The Mont Pelerin Society, Order of the Golden Bear, The Philadelphia Society (past member of board of directors), and the Western Economic Association International, (past member of the executive committee). His honors include Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs Certificate of Honor, presented by President Askar Akaev in Bishkek in 1997, in recognition of his work to prepare Kyrgyzstan to introduce its own currency, and he was inducted into Confr√©rie de la Cha√Æne des R√¥tisseurs in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1999. He has been a fellow of Johns Hopkins Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise since 2018. He received the 2019 Central Banking Award for Outstanding Contribution for Central Bank Capacity Building. =Recent employment= Coats ended seven years on CIMA in 2010 and joined the Editorial Board of the Cayman Financial Review soon thereafter. He provided technical assistance to the central bank of Afghanistan and was part of the IMF country team as a consultant, negotiating a program with Afghanistan that can be supported with an IMF Extended Credit Facility, including the resolution of Kabul Bank from 2005-2013. He was part of a Deloitte team financed by United States Agency for International Development helping the new government of South Sudan prepare for independence by establishing a new central bank and issuing a new currency from 2009-2011. Coats currently serves as director of the Africa Youth Peace Call (AYPC), and Universal Trading & Investment Co., Inc., and President of Reform International. He is a Visiting Scholar in the Institute for Capacity Development Department of the International Monetary Fund (February 20, 2018 through April 30, 2019), and an Overseas Development Institute advisor to the UN OCHA on Yemen, October 2018 to March 2019. Coats presented proposals for a hard SDR issued by a global currency board (Real SDR Currency Board) at a G20 High Level Seminar on the Reform of the International Monetary System in Nanjing, China, on March 30 of 2011, on May 4, 2011, in Astana, Kazakhstan, on July 1, 2011, in Buenos Aires, Argentina and at the May 20, 2019 Fort Worth, Texas, Mont Pelerin Society meeting.

Kaukritya (Pali: kukkucca) is identified as: * One of the fourteen unwholesome mental factors within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings * One of the four changeable mental factors within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings * One of the five hindrances to meditation (in combination with uddhacca) Explanations =Theravada= Bhikkhu Bodhi explains: :Kukkucca is worry or remorse after having done wrong. Its characteristic is subsequent regret. Its function is to sorrow over what has and what has not been done. It is manifested as remorse. Its proximate cause is what has and what has not been done (i.e. wrongs of commission and omission). The AtthasƒÅlinƒ´ (II, Book II, Part IX, Chapter III, 258) gives the following definition of kukkucca: :...It has repentance as characteristic, sorrow at deeds of commission and omission as function, regret as manifestation, deeds of commission and omission as proximate cause, and it should be regarded as a state of bondage.Gorkom (2010), Definition of Ignorance, Shamelessness, Recklessness and Restlessness Nina van Gorkom explains: :The characteristic of kukkucca is repentance. Repentance is generally considered a virtue, but the reality of kukkucca is not wholesome, it arises with dosa-m≈´la-citta (dosa). Kukkucca which ‚Äúregrets‚Äù the commission of evil and the omission of kusala is different from wholesome thinking about the disadvantages of akusala and the value of kusala. The conventional term ‚Äúworry‚Äù which is also used as translation of kukkucca may not be clear either. When we say that we worry, it may not be the reality of kukkucca but it may be thinking with aversion about an unpleasant object without there being kukkucca. For example, we may worry about the way how to solve a problem in the future; this kind of worry is not the reality of kukkucca. =Mahayana= The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: :What is kaukritya? It is an obsession regarding the positive, negative, indifferent, timely, untimely, appropriate and inappropriate on account of anything to be done intentionally or unintentionally and is related to bewilderment-erring. Its function is to obstruct the mind from becoming settled. Mipham Rinpoche states: :Regret involves sadness because of mental displeasure with a former action. It obstructs resting the mind. Alexander Berzin explains: :Regret (‚Äògyod-pa) is a part of naivety (moha). It is the state of mind that does not wish to repeat doing something, either proper or improper, that we did or that someone else made us do.Berzin (2006) See also * Mental factors (Buddhism) * Moha (Buddhism) References Sources * Berzin, Alexander (2006), Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors * Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma, Pariyatti Publishing * Guenther, Herbert V. & Leslie S.

Akers, Sandon Berg and Israel Ehrisman, and starring Leo Minaya as Morgan Oliver and Jack Kesy as Dean Kagen. Plot A young, paralyzed, gay athlete attempts to live his life in a situation far from desirable. After an accident leaves him paralyzed from the waist down, Morgan Oliver (played by Leo Minaya), is first seen wallowing in a state of depression, drowning his sorrows in beer as he watches bicycle racing (the sport that at once defined his sense of purpose and drove him to his catalytic accident) on television. He meets Dean Kagan (played by Jack Kesy) who helps him through the way and a romantic relationship develops between the two. Once Morgan knows about the New York Haven Cycle Race, he decides to take part in the race with the help of Kagan and sponsorship from Tread Bike Shop. Cast *Leo Minaya as Morgan Oliver *Jack Kesy as Dean Kagen *Ben Budd as Wesley *Theodore Bouloukos as Dr. Thomas *Darra Boyd as Lane Williams *Madalyn McKay as Peg Oliver Production Akers and Berg planned on writing a story about a paraplegic while casting for an earlier film Phoenix. A young, handsome wheelchair-using paraplegic actor had submitted his portfolio for a possible role in a film. Although the screenplay for Phoenix had been written and no role was envisioned for a paraplegic acting role, they were intrigued enough by him personally, they decided to write a screenplay around a paraplegic athlete. After many interviews with other wheelchair-using gay men, their collection of stories became the basis for the film Morgan. One odd thing was that the race was supposed to take place during Memorial Day. However, the filming was clearly done during the winter time. There were no flowers in bloom, no blue skies, and the trees were missing all of their leaves. Reception One film reviewer wrote: \\"Morgan is not a sophisticated film, but it is a very human one. Morgan has an abundance of heart and speaks to the travails of the disabled in a way that is rarely addressed in cinema, queer or otherwise. Well Done.\\" Soundtrack Music is by Ryan Rapsys.

Silman was burned severely and died of his injuries a week later. Silman's self-immolation was widely covered in the Israeli and international media and was followed by wide public and political discourse within the Israeli society.  Background  Moshe Silman was born in 1954. He was never married and he had no children. He spent several years in the United States, and he established the trucking business \\"Mika Transportation\\" when he returned to Israel. The company's operations centered on four trucks.◊û◊™ ◊û◊§◊¶◊¢◊ô◊ï ◊û◊©◊î ◊°◊ô◊ú◊û◊ü ◊©◊î◊¶◊ô◊™ ◊ê◊™ ◊¢◊¶◊û◊ï ◊ë◊î◊§◊í◊†◊™ ◊î◊û◊ó◊ê◊î ◊î◊ó◊ë◊®◊™◊ô◊™ ‚Äì ◊ó◊ô◊†◊ï◊ö ◊ï◊ó◊ë◊®◊î ‚Äì ◊î◊ê◊®◊• In 2002 Silman was charged by the National Insurance Institute of Israel to pay 15,000 NIS.

The truck was sold a year later, after Silman did not pay his debt to the National Insurance Institute.http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4255704,00.html As a result, Silman filed a tort claim against the National Insurance Institute, claiming that the institute caused him damages of more than 4.5 million and a foreclosure due to the confiscation of his truck. Silman asked the court to exempt him from paying for the legal procedure but he was refused, after the court's registrar held that \\"the amount of the claim is absurd, and so is the attempt to link the failures of the National Insurance Institute to the damage caused to applicant.\\"http://www.haoona.com/photos/rasham09.pdf Later on, Silman filed an appeal against the decision to the Supreme Court, but it was refused by the court's registrar on the grounds that Silman must appeal to the district court.◊î◊ó◊ú◊ò◊î ◊ë◊™◊ô◊ß ◊®◊¢\\"◊ê 10435/09 In 2004 Silman established a company which manufactured plastic planters. This project evidently failed, and Silman demanded compensation from the company's suppliers, but his claim was rejected. The judge criticized Silman by stating: \\"The data of this case indicates that this is not a dream we are dealing with but probably a fantasy, and that it is a pity that Silman choose to turn against all the parties whom tried to help him as much as possible in this project, without being paid for their work.\\"s05027255-188 Following the collapse of his businesses, Silman moved in with his mother in Bat Yam in 2005; he worked as a taxi driver. After his mother's death, and after her apartment was confiscated by the authorities, Silman began renting his own apartment. He later moved to Haifa, where he rented an apartment. Since his driver's license was suspended due to medical reasons, he was no longer able to make a living as a taxi driver. He turned to the National Insurance Institute to recognize his disability, but received lower disability rates. After the intervention of the Rabbis for Human Rights, in May 2012 he was recognized by the National Insurance Institute as being 100% disabled and began receiving from the institute disability payments of 2,300 NIS per month. His appeals to the Ministry of Housing and Construction for assistance in rent were rejected because he did not meet the criteria necessary for that assistance. In addition, Silman turned to the Israeli state-owned housing company Amidar and requested public housing, but his request was eventually rejected because he did not meet the criteria necessary for that assistance. His appeal to the Department of Social Affairs of the Municipality of Haifa was also rejected, and he was told by the municipality that they could only help him after he ended up in the streets. MK Orly Levy-Abekasis, chairman of the Lobby for public housing, approached the CEO of the Ministry of Housing, on behalf of Silman. Nevertheless, her appeals were also rejected.◊ó\\"◊õ ◊ê◊ï◊®◊ú◊ô ◊ú◊ï◊ô-◊ê◊ë◊ß◊°◊ô◊° ◊©◊ú◊ô◊ï◊ï◊™◊î ◊ê◊™ ◊û◊©◊î ◊°◊ô◊ú◊û◊ü: \\"◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊û◊û◊©◊ú◊î; ◊§◊ß◊ô◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊û◊†◊î◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊û◊ì◊ô◊†◊î\\" ‚Äì ◊û◊ó◊ê◊î ‚Äì ◊ì◊î ◊û◊®◊ß◊® TheMarker The Ministry of Housing said that a special committee would discuss his request again in September, but it declined to provide emergency assistance to prevent him from becoming homeless. All along Silman made it clear that he would not end up in the streets. Silman insisted that, after fulfilling his national duties via his mandatory military service and Reserves service, the state of Israel was obligated to help law-abiding citizens in such dire economic and health situations. In the past, Silman did threaten to harm himself, but his threats did not lead the welfare authorities to solve his problems. In response to his threats, the psychiatric commission representative of the National Insurance Institute claimed that those who threaten to commit suicide do not intend to commit suicide, and the Amidar clerk asked him to just not do it at the Amidar offices.◊û◊©◊î ◊°◊ô◊ú◊û◊ü ◊©◊î◊¶◊ô◊™ ◊¢◊¶◊û◊ï ◊ó◊ô◊ú◊ß ◊û◊õ◊™◊ë: \\"◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊©◊ì◊ì◊î ◊ê◊ï◊™◊ô\\" ‚Äì ◊ó◊ô◊†◊ï◊ö ◊ï◊ó◊ë◊®◊î ‚Äì ◊î◊ê◊®◊•  Social justice activities During the summer of 2011, Silman joined the activities of Israeli social justice protests in the Haifa region. Silman advocated taking a more political and active approach, in contrast to those whom sought to focus the social justice protests only on a change of consciousness within the existing framework. He claimed that the protests must be political, and that this should be reflected in an establishment of a party which would manage to overthrow the government of Benjamin Netanyahu. Silman called for active operations, such as occupying abandoned or unoccupied empty residential apartments as part of the struggle for public housing.http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4255974,00.html◊ú◊ê ◊ê◊ô◊©◊ô, ◊§◊ï◊ú◊ô◊ò◊ô ‚Äì ◊ì◊¢◊ï◊™ ‚Äì ◊î◊ê◊®◊• = Self-immolation = Silman set himself on fire during a social justice demonstration held on 14 July 2012. In the suicide letter he passed out before he burnt himself, he accused the state of Israel and the welfare system of failing to treat disadvantaged people in his situation. He blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz for the economic policy that led him to commit suicide: \\"I hold the State of Israel, Bibi Netanyahu and Steinitz, the bastards, accountable for the humiliation which the disadvantaged citizens, go through every day, as the rich and the government workers take from the poor.\\" He also blamed various government officials in National Insurance Institute, including the Claims Department Manager and the Registrar of the court in Haifa, for the injustice done to him. Silman was transferred to the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, which was the closest to the site in which the self-immolation occurred. This hospital did not include a burn unit, so he was transferred to the Sheba Medical Center. Even once he arrived there, all six beds in the burn unit were occupied and he had to be treated in the general intensive care unit of the hospital.http://www.calcalist.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3577125,00.html Moshe Silman died of his injuries on 20 July 2012. He was buried in the Beit kVarot ha-Darom Cemetery in Holon.  Aftermath  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the event as a \\"great personal tragedy\\". Israeli Minister of Education Gideon Sa'ar stated that \\"the act should remind us all of the everyday hardships of our society and of our individuals, and that we must be sensitive and responsive to the plight of others and assist as much as possible. The important thing is to understand the background of things, to understand the distress from which events such as this could derive and to be sensitive to it.\\"http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4255459,00.html MK Shelly Yachimovich stated that \\"suicide is an unusual and shocking answer to difficulties and suffering, but we must not forget the context: the inhumane hardening of the conditions of eligibility for public housing, the unraveling of the social safety net until it has holes so huge that many fall through them to the abyss; and the struggle for survival of small and medium business owners. Silman's fate occurred largely due to the collapse of the welfare state, and the rise of a Darwinian jungle economy.\\"◊ô◊ó◊ô◊û◊ï◊ë◊ô◊•' ◊¢◊ú ◊§◊ò◊ô◊®◊™◊ï ◊©◊ú ◊û◊©◊î ◊°◊ô◊ú◊û◊ü: \\"◊î◊™◊ê◊ë◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ô◊ê ◊™◊©◊ï◊ë◊î ◊ó◊®◊ô◊í◊î ◊ï◊û◊ñ◊¢◊ñ◊¢◊™ ◊ú◊ß◊ï◊©◊ô ◊ï◊ú◊°◊ë◊ú, ◊ê◊ë◊ú ◊ê◊ú ◊ú◊†◊ï ◊ú◊©◊õ◊ï◊ó ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊î◊ß◊©◊®. ◊í◊ï◊®◊ú◊ï ◊©◊ú ◊°◊ô◊ú◊û◊ü ◊î◊ï◊ê ◊ë◊û◊ô◊ì◊î ◊®◊ë◊î ◊™◊ï◊¶◊ê◊î ◊©◊ú ◊ß◊®◊ô◊°◊™◊î ◊©◊ú ◊û◊ì◊ô◊†◊™ ◊î◊®◊ï◊ï◊ó◊î\\"  ◊î◊ê◊™◊®... In the Israeli public discourse, some have compared Moshe Silman to Jan Palach or Mohamed Bouazizi; they see the state leaders (and Benjamin Netanyahu in particular) as responsible for Silman's condition.

Akiva Mafai, a 45-year-old wheelchair-bound IDF veteran, set himself on fire at a bus station and died of his wounds only two days after the death of Silman.http://www.timesofisrael.com/man-who-lit-himself-on-fire-on-sunday- dies/ On 11 December 2013 a memorial event was held for six people who had self-immolated in the past year. The Israeli government established an emergency treatment for extreme cases. Social workers complained that they do not have the tools to deal with the distress of many people beset by the housing shortages and failures of the National Insurance Institute; this may lead to an increase in suicide attempts after the affected realize that social workers cannot help them.◊ó◊ì◊©◊ï◊™ ‚Äì ◊ë◊ê◊®◊• nrg ‚Äì ...◊¢◊ï\\"◊°◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊õ◊ó◊ú◊ï◊ü: ◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊ú◊†◊ï ◊õ◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊ò◊§◊ú  See also  * List of political self-immolations  References   External links  * Israeli Protester Dies After Self-Immolation ‚Äì published in The New York Times on July 20, 2012 * Israel's New Protest Movement: Suicide by Fire ‚Äì published on newser.com on July 29, 2012 Category:2012 in Israel Category:Suicides in Israel Category:1954 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Activists who committed suicide Category:Israeli activists Category:Israeli taxicab drivers Category:Suicides by self-immolation ","title":"Moshe Silman"},{"id":"36695644","text":"Bo Jansson (born 20 April 1937) is a Swedish modern pentathlete who competed at the 1964 and 1972 Summer Olympics.

The feminine form of the name is Vatatzina or Batatzina (ŒíŒ±œÑŒ±œÑŒ∂ŒØŒΩŒ±). Origins According to the Greek scholar Konstantinos Amantos, the name ŒíŒ±œÑŒ¨œÑŒ∂Œ∑œÇ is a diminutive form of Œ≤Œ¨œÑŒøœÇ, \\"bramble, briar\\", and suggests that it was given as a nickname signifying a harsh character. Another possible origin is Œ≤Œ±œÑŒ¨Œ∫Œπ, \\"ray fish\\". The first member of the family, known simply by his surname, is attested around the year 1000. John Skylitzes (Synopsis Historion, 343.134) records that \\"Vatatzes with his entire family\\" was among those \\"distinguished citizens of Adrianople\\" who fled to the Bulgarian emperor Samuel because they were accused of pro-Bulgarian sentiments. Over the next centuries, the family remained associated with Adrianople and the surrounding region (the thema of Macedonia), where their estates were. Likewise the 13th- century chronicler Ephraim the Monk mentions Didymoteichon/Orestias as the family's native city. In the 11th‚Äì12th centuries Michael Psellos records that in 1047, a John Vatatzes, relative of Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos (), joined the revolt of Leo Tornikios. The family became prominent in the 12th century, when several members rose to high offices. Theodore Vatatzes married Eudokia, the sister of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos () and was named despotes; his sons were Andronikos, Alexios, and John Komnenos Vatatzes, who became megas domestikos (commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army). The hagiographer of the Nicaean emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes (), identified John with the latter's grandfather, who supposedly had two sons named Nikephoros and Theodore, who were persecuted by Andronikos I Komnenos (). According to Niketas Choniates, however, John's sons were named Manuel and Alexios. This is most likely the result of a confusion by the hagiographer. Other contemporary members were Leo Vatatzes, who under Manuel I fought against the Hungarians; a 12th-century seal mentions the \\"patrikios, hypatos, and stratelates of the West\\" Bryennios Vatatzes; another seal mentions Nikephoros Vatatzes, \\"protoproedros, vestarches, megas doux, and praetor of the Aegean Sea\\"; a Joseph Vatatzes, possibly a monk, is also known through his seal, likely from the 13th century; while a Basil Vatatzes is known as doux and anagrapheus of a province under the Nicaean emperor Theodore I Laskaris (). Rulers of the Empire of Nicaea Another Basil Vatatzes, a man of undistinguished birth according to Choniates, married into the Angelos family and rose to become domestikos of the West under Isaac II Angelos (). It is possibly due to this connection that the 14th-century Chronicle of the Morea calls Isaac II \\"Sakes Vatatzes\\" (Œ£Œ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ ŒíŒ±œÑŒ¨œÑŒ∂Œ∑œÇ). Modern scholars consider Basil as the father of John III Doukas Vatatzes, who thus had no direct connection to the Komnenian-era noble family. Basil had two further sons, the sebastokrator Isaac and an anonymous third son. Isaac had a son named John and an unnamed daughter who married Constantine Strategopoulos, while the other brother had a daughter who became the wife of the protovestiarios Alexios Raoul. Born in , John married Irene, daughter of the founder of the Empire of Nicaea, Theodore I Laskaris (), and succeeded him on the throne, despite the opposition of Theodore's brothers. John proved a capable ruler, defeating the Latin Empire at the Battle of Poimanenon, and expanding his realm into Europe, where he captured Thessalonica in 1246. Remembered for his kindness as well as his ability, he was venerated as a saint after his death by the Greeks of Asia Minor. John III was succeeded as Emperor of Nicaea by his only son Theodore II (), who however preferred his mother's surname, Laskaris. With his wife Helena, he had five children. Theodore II was succeeded by his only son, John IV Laskaris (), but was driven from the throne by Michael VIII Palaiologos () after the reconquest of Constantinople in 1261, blinded, and placed in confinement in a remote fortress, where he died some time after 1285. Later members The last prominent member was John Vatatzes, who occupied a succession of high offices in 1333‚Äì1345. Another John Vatatzes was a landowner at Caesaropolis in 1320‚Äì1322; a Constantine Vatatzes was archon in Ioannina in 1367, before being banished by Thomas Preljubovic; a Basil Vatatzes was a hymn writer sometime before 1433; a Theodore Vatatzes donated to the Agioi Pantes Monastery of Mount Athos in 1447; John Vatatzes was a hymn writer from Crete and protopsaltes (first cantor) at Candia in 1465; the goldsmith Frangiskos Vatatzes is known from a testament of 1497; and in 1563 the priest Konstantinos Vatatzes is attested. Finally, in the 17th century, Vasilios Vatatzes (born 1694) from Therapeia near Constantinople, who travelled extensively in Persia and Russia and wrote about his travels. A variant of the family name, Diplovatatzes (ŒîŒπœÄŒªŒøŒ≤Œ±œÑŒ¨œÑŒ∂Œ∑œÇ, \\"Double Vatatzes\\"), was used from the mid-13th century on for family members who descended from the Vatatzai on both sides. They too ranked among the senior nobility of the late Byzantine Empire. An Alexios and Manuel Diplovatatzes are mentioned in the 14th century, along with the protovestiarites and lord of Veroia Diplovatatzes; a Theodore Diplovatatzes granted the Vatopedi Monastery lands on Lemnos in 1430; and the last member of the family was Tommaso Diplovataccio (1468‚Äì1541), who became a distinguished jurist and scholar in Renaissance Italy.

Ethnic groups =Black/African Americans= Tanzanians Most Tanzanians who have arrived in the United States since 1986 have chosen to settle in Chicago. Many of them are students and professionals who came to the city to pursue an advanced degree or work for an employer that sponsored their entry into the United States. Some of the Tanzanians have returned to their home country a few years after arriving in the U. S.\\"Tanzanians\\", Encyclopedia of Chicago, authored by Tramayne M. Butler, 2005 Religion plays an active role in the lives of many Tanzanian Americans in Chicago. =Hispanic and Latino Americans= Nearly two million Hispanic live in metropolitan Chicago, representing in excess of 20% of the region‚Äôs total population and constituting the third largest Hispanic community in the United States. Like other regions of the nation, Chicago Hispanic are the fastest growing segment of the overall population, increasing 25% in the last decade, and are, not surprisingly, beginning to wield enormous economic and political clout as their numbers grow. About 20% of Chicago‚Äôs Hispanics also happen to be undocumented migrants. Mexicans Mexicans contribute to 79.2% of the Hispanic population in Chicago, with Puerto Ricans the second largest. Puerto Ricans =White Americans= Chicago has one of the largest Central/Eastern European and/or Slavic immigrant populations in the nation. The largest amongst this particular group are the Poles. Polish is the second- most spoken foreign language in Chicago behind Spanish. Bosnian Americans Czech Americans German Americans Irish Americans Italian Americans Jewish Americans Lithuanian Americans Polish Americans Swedish Americans Welsh Americans Assyrians According to the 2000 U.S. Census, Chicago is home to 15,683 Assyrians. This is believed to be the largest Assyrian population in the United States.Cutler, p. 196. The Assyrians in Chicago settled in Albany Park, Edgewater, Rogers Park, and Uptown. In the suburbs, Assyrians have settled Morton Grove, Niles, and Skokie.Cutler, p. 193, 196. The first Assyrian church in Chicago opened in 1917 in the Near North Side.Cutler, p. 193. The Assyrian American Association was established in 1917. It is located at 1618 West Devon Avenue, two blocks east of the Assyrian Pentecostal Church.Cutler, p. 197. Arab and Middle Eastern Americans As of 2006 there are about 8,500 Arabs in the Chicago metropolitan area, with most of them being Palestinian. Chicago Lawn has one main area of Palestinian settlement, and Albany Park has the other. In the latter, many are Christian. As of 2006 several southwestern suburbs including Bridgeview, Hickory Hills, and Oak Lawn had Arab populations;Cutler, p. 198. Robin Amer of WBEZ stated in 2013 that Bridgeview, Oak Lawn, and Orland Park had Arab populations, with Bridgeview having the most established Arab community. Many Arabs arrived to Chicago after the Arab-Israeli wars occurred. the Chicago area has the largest Palestinian American population in the U.S., and that Chicago-area Palestinian-origin people made up 25% of all Palestinian-originating persons in the U.S. In 1995 there were 85,000 persons of Palestinian origin in the Chicago area, making up about 60% of the Arab Americans there; at that time about 50% of the Chicago-area ethnic Palestinians were born in the U.S. The West Bank is the main source of Palestinian immigration into Chicago, and specifically most of the Palestinian people in the Chicago area have origins in Beitunia. Many of them immigrated as extended families. In the late 19th century people from Ottoman Syria, including Muslims from modern day Palestinian territories and historical Palestine and Christians from modern-day Lebanon and Syria, moved to Chicago; at the time people in all three groups were called \\"Syrians\\".\\"Palestinians.\\" Encyclopedia of Chicago. Retrieved on January 17, 2017. Many Syrians who moved to Chicago originally were street peddlers. As time passed, they opened linen, carpet, and other luxury good stores; wholesale stores; and dry goods retail stores. In 1893 Syrians who wished to sell products at the Columbian Exposition began arriving to Chicago. 30 Syrian families lived in Chicago at the time World War II started. Until World War II Muslims from the Palestine area living in Chicago were almost all male, and they sent money to relatives in the Middle East and returned to their mother country to retire. Palestinian Christians began moving to the Chicago area in the 1960s. After the Six-Day War in 1967 additional Syrians moved to Chicago. Palestinian Christians began settling a section of Chicago's North Side in the 1960s. In the 1970s Muslim Palestinians settled Chicago Lawn and Gage Park, and by the 1980s moved into the following southwest Cook County communities: Alsip, Bridgeview, Burbank, Hickory Hills, Oak Lawn, and Palos Hills. An Arab commercial area opened in Albany Park in the 1970s. There is a mosque in Bridgeview. There is a Greek Orthodox Christian church in Cicero patronized by Palestinian Christians and Jordanian Christians. Other White ethnic groups As of 2006 the Armenian population is located in the far northwest of Chicago and in the Chicago suburbs. Waukegan, Illinois has a significant Armenian population. For a period its mayor was Armenian. The initial settlement of Armenians was in West Pullman on the Far South Side. In the early 1900s Armenians fleeing persecution from Turks arrived in Chicago. In the middle of the twentieth century some Armenians in Chicago favored Armenian independence and some favored the Soviet Union. Additional Armenians arrived after Armenia's 1990 independence from Russia.Cutler, p. 196-197. Most Chicago area Armenians are businesspeople. Irving wrote that \\"they dominate the imported rug market.\\" In 2006 there were perhaps as many as 25,000 Chicago area Iranians, including about 6,000 in the Chicago city limits. Iranian ethnic groups represented include Persians, Kurds, Turks, Azeris, and Lurs. Many Iranians live in Uptown. Reza's, which Irving described as one of the most famous Iranian restaurants in Chicago, is in Uptown. Some Iranians operate restaurants and small retail stores, some work in professions, and some work as taxi drivers. Religious groups represented include Muslims and Bah√°'√≠. The Bah√°'√≠ temple is in Wilmette, Illinois. Israelis began coming to Chicago in the 1970s during a period of military conflict and economic issues in Israel.\\"Israelis.\\" Encyclopedia of Chicago. Retrieved on January 17, 2017. Circa 2017 the placement of Dyson's US headquarters in Chicago was a factor that caused British nationals to come to Chicago. The Chicago Tribune stated that UK citizens are scattered throughout the metropolitan area rather than being concentrated in a particular place. A Baird & Warner real estate agent, Jim Kinney, stated that suburbs to the west were popular with \\"middle management\\" while higher levels of employees had preferences for the Chicago North Shore. =Asian Americans= In 2011 Asians make up 12.7% of the population in the northwestern Chicago suburbs. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, the 10 suburbs with the highest percentages of Asians were South Barrington, Oak Brook, Hoffman Estates, Glendale Heights, Schaumburg, Vernon Hills, Buffalo Grove, Hanover Park, Streamwood, and Naperville. As of 2011, in DuPage County, 10.1% of the population was Asian, and in Lake County 6.3% of the population was Asian.Selvam, Ashok. \\"Asian population booming in suburbs.\\" Chicago Daily Herald.

As of that year 17,500 people of Japanese descent live in the Chicago metropolitan area suburbs such as Arlington Heights, Evanston, Hoffman Estates, Lincolnwood, and Skokie. Most Japanese within the City of Chicago live in lakefront areas in the North Side, including Edgewater, Lake View, Near North Side, Uptown, and West Ridge.Cutler, p. 190. Koreans As of the 2000 U.S. Census there were 45,000 South Korean- origin people in the metro area. As of 2006 the largest groups of Koreans are in Albany Park, North Park, West Ridge, and other communities near Albany Park. By that time many Koreans began moving to northern and northwestern Chicago suburbs, settling in Glenview, Morton Grove, Mount Prospect, Niles, Northbrook, Schaumburg, and Skokie. In 2011 Chunho Park, a resident quoted in the Chicago Daily Herald stated that, as paraphrased by journalist Ashok Selvam, \\"Many Koreans are drawn to the area around Golf Road and Milwaukee Avenue\\" in the Niles area, in proximity to the Super H Mart. Filipinos As of 2000 the Filipinos are the fourth-largest group immigrating to the Chicago area. As of that year there were a total of 81,000 Filipinos in Chicago metropolitan area, including about 29,000 Filipinos in the City of Chicago. The majority of Filipinos in the City of Chicago live in the North Side and in the Northwest Side. The neighborhoods with especially significant amounts include Edgewater, and Uptown to the north and Albany Park, Irving Park, Lincoln Square, and West Ridge to the northwest. Suburban cities with Filipinos included Glendale Heights, Morton Grove, North Chicago, Skokie, and Waukegan.Cutler, p. 191. As of 2000 most Filipinos work in the medical sector and are financially well off. Of the Asian groups, the Filipinos had the highest annual median household income, at $55,164, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. Filipinos are not as tightly clustered together as other Asian ethnic groups are. Many live in close proximity to hospitals or near Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) elevated lines. In the 1920s the first group of Filipinos arrived in Chicago. The first group of Filipinos had to work as laborers in hotels and restaurants, for the post office, and for Pullman's menial jobs due to discrimination. There were about 2,000 Filipinos in Chicago by 1930. After the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 passed, Filipino immigration increased. The Filipino-American Council of Chicago, founded in 1948, serves the community. Indians, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis As of 2006 there are about 114,000 Indian-origin people in the Chicago metropolitan area, a population of Pakistan-origin people fewer than one-sixth of the Indian count, and a growing Bangladeshi population ; together they make up about 30% of the Asian Americans in the Chicago area, and it is the second largest combined population of Indians, Bangladeshi and Pakistanis in the U.S. after that of New York City, and the fourth largest in North America after that of New York City, Toronto and Vancouver.name=Cutlerp199>Cutler, p. 199https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/south-asians As of 2006 the Indians are the third largest immigrant group settling in .Cutler, p. 201. The main Indopak business district is along Devon Avenue between Damen Avenue and California Avenue. There are also Indopak businesses in Chicago suburbs. In 2006 Cutler wrote that \\"Indians and Pakistanis are dispersed throughout the metropolitan area\\".Cutler, p. 199. Chicago suburbs with significant populations of Indopak people are Des Plaines, Downers Grove, Glendale Heights, Hanover Park, Hoffman Estates, Mount Prospect, Naperville, Oak Brook, Palatine, Schaumburg, Skokie. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 increased settlements of Indians, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis. Many initial settlers were professionals who arrived in Uptown and later relocated to wealthy suburbs. As of 2006 many more recent immigrants, after arriving, start work as office workers, janitors, and taxicab drivers; they are from lower income backgrounds. Cutler wrote that the Indian and Pakistani groups \\"often live in close proximity and have had similar experiences, including some discrimination\\" but the two groups \\"generally keep separate\\".Cutler, p. 201-202. Cutler wrote that in regards to the Indian and Pakistani groups \\"in Chicago their relations are more peaceful than those on the Indian subcontinent.\\"Cutler, p. 202. The Chicago metropolitan area has 70 non-Muslim Indian social groups. Older Indians participate in the regional linguistic- based groups, but younger people do not participate as often. Both groups keep track of developments in South Asia and have concerns about the development of the youth in the United States. Indian-Americans are among the most economically successful recent immigrants to the Chicago area.Cutler, p. 199, 201. As of 2006 many Indians and Pakistanis operate Dunkin Donuts franchise locations. The Indians, Bangladeshi and Pakistanis have distinct religious, educational, and social facilities. Most Bangladeshi and Pakistani religious facilities are Muslim. But diverse ethnicities and sectarian groups of Pakistani origin often organize themselves along sectarian or ethnic lines. Of the Indians, about 80% are Hindu, about 7% are Muslim, and about 5% are Sikh. Cities with Hindu temples include Aurora, Bartlett, and Lemont. The Lemont temple was dedicated in 1986 and as of 2004 the Bartlett temple is new. Thais As of 2006 there were about 10,000 people of Thai origins in the north and northwest sides of Chicago and various suburbs. The most prominent suburban group is in Bridgeview. The first Thais arrived in the 1950s. Many of them were university students. As of 2006 over half of the Thais in the Chicago area work in the medical sector. Thai doctors and nurses came because in the United States there was a lack of health professionals. There are around 12 Thai groceries in the Chicago area as of 2006. At first produce was transported by aircraft from Bangkok since some Thais had difficulty in eating American food. By 2006 many kinds of Thai produce were now produced in the United States. There are five Thai Buddhist temples in the Chicago area. The largest is the Thai Buddhist Temple in Bridgeview. Three temples are in the southwest suburbs. By 2006 many Thai restaurants were established in Chicago. The largest concentrations were in the Near North Side and the Lakeview/Uptown/Edgewater areas. Other Asian groups Of the Southeast Asians in Chicago, most of them are Vietnamese. Some of them are Laotians.Cutler, p. 188. There is a primarily Vietnamese neighborhood near Argyle Street in Uptown. As of 2006, several thousand Cambodians live in Chicago. Most of them are Buddhists and many had arrived in Chicago in 1979-1985 from rural areas after the Khmer Rouge killings. Many live in the same areas as Laotians and Vietnamese, while some who had gained economic status after arriving moved to the suburbs. The Cambodian Association is located in Uptown.Cutler, p. 189. As of 2006 there were fewer than 1,000 Indonesians in Chicago and its suburbs. As of that year the number of Indonesian restaurants was increasing. In December 1999, according to the Hmong National Development Inc., Chicago had about 500 Hmong people.Kaiser, Robert L. \\"After 25 Years In U.s., Hmong Still Feel Isolated.\\" Chicago Tribune. December 27, 1999. 2. Retrieved on April 14, 2012. =Native Americans= the Chicago area has over 65,000 people with ancestry from around 175 Native American tribes, making it the third largest settlement of Native Americans in an American urban area. The American Indian Center (AIC) in Albany Park is a community center for Native Americans and helps people moving from reservations adjust to life in Chicago. It previously offered a larger amount of social service support, but the establishment of Native Americans lead to a scaleback of these programs. Until 2017 it occupied an ex-Masonic lodge in Uptown. The AIC's executive director, a Wyandotte woman named Heather Miller, stated that the Native American presence in the area gave the community the nickname \\"Redskin Row\\". The IAC moved to its current location after the AIC sold the former facility. Prior to the development of Chicago, the Algonquin, Miami, and other tribes lived in the area. Almost all were eventually removed after the Black Hawk War and the Treaty of Chicago occurred in the mid-1830s, but some Native Americans came to Chicago in the 1950s as a result of the Indian Relocation Act of 1956.

Most mammals are viviparous, giving birth to live young. However, the five species of monotreme, the platypuses and the echidnas, lay eggs. The monotremes have a sex determination system different from that of most other mammals. In particular, the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal. The mammary glands of mammals are specialized to produce milk, a liquid used by newborns as their primary source of nutrition. The monotremes branched early from other mammals and do not have the teats seen in most mammals, but they do have mammary glands. The young lick the milk from a mammary patch on the mother's belly. Viviparous mammals are in the subclass Theria; those living today are in the Marsupialia and Placentalia infraclasses. A marsupial has a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle, and gives birth to an underdeveloped (altricial) newborn that then undergoes further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located in the front of the mother's abdomen. Some placentals, e.g. guinea pig, give birth to fully developed (precocial) young, usually after long gestation periods, while some others, e.g. mouse, give birth to underdeveloped young. Reproductive system =Placental mammals= Male placental mammals The mammalian male reproductive system contains two main divisions, the penis and the testicles, the latter of which is where sperm are produced. In humans, both of these organs are outside the abdominal cavity, but they can be primarily housed within the abdomen in other animals. For instance, a dog's penis is covered by a penile sheath except when mating. Having the testicles outside the abdomen best facilitates temperature regulation of the sperm, which require specific temperatures to survive. The external location may also cause a reduction in the heat-induced contribution to the spontaneous mutation rate in male germinal tissue. Sperm are the smaller of the two gametes and are generally very short-lived, requiring males to produce them continuously from the time of sexual maturity until death. The produced sperm are stored in the epididymis until ejaculation. The sperm cells are motile and they swim using tail-like flagella to propel themselves towards the ovum. The sperm follows temperature gradients (thermotaxis) and chemical gradients (chemotaxis) to locate the ovum.  The mammalian female reproductive system likewise contains two main divisions: the vagina and uterus, which act as the receptacle for the sperm, and the ovaries, which produce the female's ova. All of these parts are always internal. The vagina is attached to the uterus through the cervix, while the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the Fallopian tubes. At certain intervals, the ovaries release an ovum, which passes through the fallopian tube into the uterus. If, in this transit, it meets with sperm, the egg selects sperm with which to merge; this is termed fertilization. The fertilization usually occurs in the oviducts, but can happen in the uterus itself. The zygote then implants itself in the wall of the uterus, where it begins the processes of embryogenesis and morphogenesis. When developed enough to survive outside the womb, the cervix dilates and contractions of the uterus propel the fetus through the birth canal, which is the vagina. The ova, which are the female sex cells, are much larger than the sperm and are normally formed within the ovaries of the fetus before its birth. They are mostly fixed in location within the ovary until their transit to the uterus, and contain nutrients for the later zygote and embryo. Over a regular interval, in response to hormonal signals, a process of oogenesis matures one ovum which is released and sent down the Fallopian tube. If not fertilized, this egg is released through menstruation in humans and other great apes, and reabsorbed in other mammals in the estrus cycle. =Gestation= The initial stages of human embryogenesis. Gestation, called pregnancy in humans, is the period of time during which the fetus develops, dividing via mitosis inside the female. During this time, the fetus receives all of its nutrition and oxygenated blood from the female, filtered through the placenta, which is attached to the fetus' abdomen via an umbilical cord. This drain of nutrients can be quite taxing on the female, who is required to ingest slightly higher levels of calories. In addition, certain vitamins and other nutrients are required in greater quantities than normal, often creating abnormal eating habits. The length of gestation, called the gestation period, varies greatly from species to species; it is 40 weeks in humans, 56‚Äì60 in giraffes and 16 days in hamsters. =Birth= Once the fetus is sufficiently developing, chemical signals start the process of birth, which begins with contractions of the uterus and the dilation of the cervix. The fetus then descends to the cervix, where it is pushed out into the vagina, and eventually out of the female. The newborn, which is called an infant in humans, should typically begin respiration on its own shortly after birth. Not long after, the placenta is passed as well. =Monotremes= Monotremes, only five species of which exist, all from Australia and New Guinea, are mammals that lay eggs. They have one opening for excretion and reproduction called the cloaca. They hold the eggs internally for several weeks, providing nutrients, and then lay them and cover them like birds. Like marsupial \\"joeys\\", monotreme \\"puggles\\" are larval and fetus-like, as like them they cannot expand their torso due to the presence of epipubic bones, forcing them to produce undeveloped young. =Marsupials= Marsupials' reproductive systems differ markedly from those of placental mammals,Iowa State University Biology Dept. Discoveries about Marsupial Reproduction Anna King 2001. webpage (note shows code, html extension omitted) though it is probably the plesiomorphic condition found in viviparous mammals, including non-placental eutherians.Giallombardo, Andres, 2009 New Cretaceous mammals from Mongolia and the early diversification of Eutheria Ph.D. dissertion, Columbia University, 2009402 pages; AAT 3373736 (abstract) The origin of Placental Mammals, Cimolestidae, Zalambdalestidae During embryonic development, a choriovitelline placenta forms in all marsupials. In bandicoots, an additional chorioallantoic placenta forms, although it lacks the chorionic villi found in eutherian placentas. Gametogenesis Animals, including mammals, produce gametes (sperm and egg) through meiosis in gonads (testicles in males and ovaries in females). Sperm are produced by the process of spermatogenesis and eggs are produced by oogenesis. These processes are outlined in the article gametogenesis. During gametogenesis in mammals many genes encoding proteins that take part in DNA repair mechanisms show enhanced or specialized expression These mechanisms include meiotic homologous recombinational repair and mismatch repair.

His main talents are not those generally considered as an artistic, but would now be viewed as the creation of scientific models, but they were highly regarded as curiosity pieces in his time. He has also been called an anatomist. He was born in Siracusa, Italy, and showed an entirely self-taught inclination to sculptural arts and anatomy. Not familiar with chiseling, he learned to model colored wax. This led to his patronage by the Grand Duke of Tuscany in Florence, for whom he created a series of five morbid models, almost a memento mori, depicting the progressive Corruption after death, beginning with a dying man, followed by a corpse, a corpse just starting to decompose, half corrupt, another completely corrupt, and finally eaten by worms. Once displayed in the Medici gallery, it was later transferred to the cabinet of natural history and zoological specimens (now displayed in the Section of the Natural History Museum called La Specola). Zumbo left Florence for Genoa. There he completed wax sculptures: a Nativity and a Deposition. He made a partnership with a French Surgeon called Desnoues, and with him completed a number of anatomic studies including a woman who died while in childbirth. With Denoues, he travelled to Paris, and there presented to the Academy of Sciences, a wax sculpture of the head with naturalistic depiction of veins, arteries, nerves, glands, and muscles. Similar work by Giuseppe Salerno is in the Sansevero Chapel in Naples, Italy. The central character of the novel Secrecy (2013) by Rupert Thomson, is based on Zumbo.Rupert Thomson, \\" Fugitive Pieces\\", Financial Times, March 1, 2013, accessed 15 March 2014.

Many of the corpses of the shabiha militia killed were in military uniform. A secondary school has turned into a police station, a courthouse and a temporary town hall run by the rebels. It is part of a nascent rebel administration that is taking shape in areas of the country where Assad's authority has disappeared as his security forces try to secure control of Syria's main cities: Aleppo, Damascus, Homs and others. A defector from the Assad administration, Abdul Hadi heads a \\"revolutionary\\" security force made up of some 40 officers, all of them former policemen in the government. At times, Abdul Hadi's role seems more akin to that of a local mayor than a police officer. Among his self- assigned responsibilities, he monitors local bread supplies, urging bakeries to adjust production according to need. Recent rebel attacks on a government- owned wheat silo and army gasoline depots have given them access to new supplies. On 21 November, rebels attacked the nearby Sheikh Suleiman base (which was under siege for over two months), but were repelled from the area by an army counterattack, in which 25 rebels were killed. on 10 December, the base was taken by opposition forces. A little over 100 regime troops that were left inside the base retreated to the scientific building wearing gas masks. The town was under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant since September 2013, but they withdrew following a wide-scale offensive led by the Army of Mujahedeen and the Islamic Front. Sabah and A Haber have stated that the Turkish Armed Forces may be establishing a base by the Sheikh Barakat Mountain to facilitate an advance into Idlib Governorate. Recently, the town came under the control of the Syrian National Army.

It involved United States Marines stationed in China (the \\"China Marines\\") allegedly raping a Chinese university student in Peking (Beijing). The case On Christmas Eve, 1946, US Marine corporal William Gaither Pierson and private Warren T. Pritchard stopped Shen Chong, a Peking University student, on her way home and forced her into the Peiping Polo Field. A mechanic from a nearby repair shop reported the crying girl being dragged into the field, first to his peers, then to the police. The mechanics were driven away by the soldiers when they tried to intervene, even with a policeman accompanying in the second attempt. By the time a senior officer arrived at the scene, Pritchard had already left.America Perceived: The Making of Chinese Images of the United States, 1945-1953 By Hong Zhang, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, p78 Later Pierson was convicted by US Marine Court led by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Fitzgerald for raping her, but the verdict was overturned by the US Department of Navy for insufficient evidence.China's America: The Chinese View the United States, 1900-2000 By Jing Li, SUNY Press:2011 p 49 Public anger Pierson and US consular official Myrl Myres claimed that Shen Chong was a prostitute, and such claim contributed to the public anger. Shen Chong was reportedly from an elite family of Shen Baozhen and Lin Zexu, and was studying in the most prestigious university in China; thus the claim she was a prostitute was viewed as adding insult to injury. Selective reporting in US media and later acquittal of the soldiers added more fuel to then Chinese public rage against American military presence in China. In February 1947 alone, police arrested thousands of rape case protesters. The government of the Republic of China's action alienated students and intellectuals and pushed them closer to the communists, who played a leading role in the protests.A Rape in Beijing, December 1946: GIs, Nationalist Protests, and U.S. Foreign Policy by Robert Shaffer, The Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 69, No. 1 (Feb., 2000), pp. 31-64 Aftermath Because of the intense publicity, Shen Chong was unable to continue her studies at Peking University. She changed her name to Shen Jun (Ê≤àÂ≥ª) and later was admitted to Fudan University in Shanghai. After graduating with a degree in Russian, she worked in Beijing-based Foreign Languages Press for decades. She married the renowned Chinese cartoonist Ding Cong. For most of her life, the public was unaware of the whereabouts of Shen Chong. In an interview with a journalist in 2012, Shen Jun finally revealed that she was Shen Chong; she also refuted a conspiracy theory that she was collaborating with the Communists to provoke an international incident. She stated that she joined the party in 1956, nearly a decade after the incident. Shen died of lung cancer in Beijing on December 11, 2014, aged 87.

Life Bennett was born at Exeter in 1778.Graves, 1885 While apprenticed to the engraver Abraham Ezekiel in the city, he learned Hebrew and became enthusiastic about music. Following the expiration of his apprenticeship he moved to London and set himself up as miniature painter. He studied under Sir Thomas Lawrence, and gained a considerable reputation as a painter of portraits and miniatures. He mixed with many of the most distinguished literary men of that day, among whom his wit and talents made him a great favourite. In 1806, however, he moved to Bath, to study with the singing teacher Rauzzini. In December of that year he made his first public appearance as a singer at a concert in Bath, at which he performed an air composed by Rauzzini. According to an article in the Monthly Review, \\"his reception was most flattering; the song was loudly encored, and, in one of Handel's songs, he was equally successful. After this, he continued to sing at the concerts, during the season, and also at the catch club, held at York- house\\". The Monthly Review continued: > Mr. Bennett had long determined to make trial of the stage ; and, towards > the end of the season, made his debut in the character of Prince Orlando, in > the comic opera of The Cabinet. His reception here was more flattering than > at the concerts, and he made an engagement with the managers to play a few > nights ; which he did, in the following characters: Don Carlos, in the > Duenna; Young Meadows, in Love in a Village; Don Alphonso, in The Castle of > Andalusia; Lord William, in the Haunted Tower; Paul, in Paul and Virginia; > and Patrick, in The Poor Soldier‚Äîin all of which he gave much satisfaction. > Just before the opening of the Hay-market theatre, in the same season, he > received an offer to play six nights there, which he accepted; but to get up > an opera was deemed impracticable, and he played the six nights in musical > after-pieces. His first appearance before a London audience was in the > character of Paul, in Paul and Virginia, it being only his seventh > appearance on any stage, and his reception was extremely favourable to so > young a performer.\\" He remained in Bath for some time, continuing to work as a miniature painter while studying music, and published a few compositions including a glee called \\"The Stars of the night arise\\", a duet for two voices, entitled, \\"Sweet warbling bird with dulcet note\\", and a song called \\"The Victory off Trafalgar\\". Several of his works were exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1812 and 1816, and again in 1834 and 1835. He spent some years in Paris, where his talents won him the patronage and friendship of the Duc de Berri; but in 1844 he returned to Exeter, where, painting only as an amusement, he lived until his death, on 17 October 1858.

Life She was the daughter and heiress of Giso IV, Count of Gudensberg (1070 - 12 March 1122), Count of Gudensberg and Hesse and Kunigunde of Bilstein (d. 1138/1140). Hedwig married in 1110 to Louis, the son of Count Louis the Springer of Thuringia. Her husband was elevated to Landgrave of Thuringia in 1131. After her brother Giso V, Count of Gudensberg, the County of Hesse and the other vast possessions of the Gisones dynasty fell to her and her husband and thus fell to the Thuringian branch of the Ludowingians dynasty. In 1122, Hedwig's mother, Kunigunde of Bilstein remarried to Henry Raspe I, who was Louis I's younger brother. Kunigunde thus became her daughter's sister-in-law. Via these two marriages, the Thuringian counts inherited an extensive triple heritage: # The possessions of the Gisones dynasty to the North of Marburg, including the bailiwick of Wetter # A large part of the Lordship of Bilstein south of Marburg, plus the bailiff of Hersfeld Abbey # The possessions of the Counts of Werner. This family had died out in 1121 and Hedwig's parents had inherited their possessions. These include the County of Maden-Gudensberg and the post of bailiff of the Fritzlar Cathedral, Hasungen Abbey and Breitenau Abbey In 1128 Hedwig gave birth to her son Louis II. In 1140, Louis I died and King Conrad III enfeoffed twelve-year- old Louis II with Thuringia. While he was a minor, Hedwig acted as regent. In 1148, Hedwig founded Ahnaberg Abbey, together with her second son Henry Raspe II, who at the time administered the parts of Hesse held by the Ludowingians. A settlement grew between this abbey and the former Franconian royal court Chasalla (from , \\"castle\\"), on the left bank of the Fulda and this settlement developed into the city of Kassel, which became the capital of Hesse in the 13th century.

The outcome of the case affects over 3,000 claimants and entails around ¬£130m unpaid benefits. Facts Ms Reilly claimed that the Secretary of State had acted ultra vires by forcing her to attend two weeks of 'training' and work for another two weeks at Poundland without pay, just in order to receive Jobseeker‚Äôs Allowance. Under the new Jobseeker's Act 1995 s 17A, the Secretary of State could write regulations for claimants to get JSA in prescribed circumstances, and to be require to take part in schemes of a 'prescribed description', which under s 35 meant 'determined in accordance with regulations'. The Secretary of State wrote the Jobseeker‚Äôs Allowance (Employment, Skills and Enterprise Scheme) Regulations 2011 where regulation 2 said schemes were to assist claimants to get employment, but did not contain any description of the scheme. Under regulation 4(2)(c)(e) claimants were supposed to be given written notice of what they were 'required to do' and information about the consequences of failing to do so. After, the SS announced sub-schemes and issued guidance to Jobcentre advisers to give claimants 'full details' of available schemes. Reilly received no written notification requiring her to join a scheme, but was simply told by a Jobcentre adviser that training and Poundland was mandatory. In a joined case, Mr Wilson was given written notice requiring his participation in a scheme for the long-term employed and that his income 'may be stopped for up to 26 weeks' if he did not take part. The Jobcentre refused to give any more information. He refused to take part and his income was stopped for 6 months. Reilly and Wilson claimed the Regulations should be quashed for being (1) ultra vires JSA 1995 s 17A because they failed to prescribe a description of the scheme (2) there was a failure to comply with the notice provisions in reg 4, and (3) enforcing the Regulations was unlawful without a published policy on the nature of the scheme and unpaid work. Reilly added that (4) needing to take unpaid work was forced labour contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights article 4. Judgment =High Court= On 6 August 2012, the High Court ruled (contrary to the arguments of Reilly and Wilson) that the scheme could not be considered slavery, and was not therefore a breach of Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights. On the other hand, it also ruled that the Department for Work and Pensions had breached its Regulation 4 (which required certain details of the Work Programme to be given to participants in writing). Both parties expressed their wish to appeal the judgement. =Court of Appeal= On 12 February 2013, the decision of the High Court was overturned on appeal, with the Court of Appeal ruling that the work placement system was unlawful because Parliament had not given the DWP lawful authority to impose such schemes and because the people involved were not provided with sufficient information about it. The Court of Appeal quashed the Jobseeker's Allowance (Employment, Skills and Enterprise Scheme) Regulations 2011. The court did not state whether or not the current case impinges on Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The government appealed the judgment, but on 30 October 2013, the decision of the Appeal Court was upheld by the Supreme Court. =Supreme Court= The Supreme Court held there had been no contravention of Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights,http://www.supremecourt.uk/decided- cases/docs/UKSC_2013_0064_Judgment.pdf but since the court ruled against workfare the comments regarding the human rights do not form part of the reasons for the judgment and therefore are not legally binding. Lord Neuberger and Lord Toulson wrote the following: Lord Clarke, Lord Mance and Lord Sumption agreed. Significance =Reactions= The findings of the court have been judged to indicate a shift in the nature of \\"the relationship between social rights and obligations in the context of unemployment policy\\" in the UK: the founder of the modern UK welfare state, William Beveridge, conceived the classical welfare state as freeing people from Want, while obliging them to work when possible. Kenneth Veitch has argued the rulings in Reilly v Secretary of State imply that Want is now used as a threat to ensure that welfare claimants habituate themselves to the demands of the contemporary workplace.Kenneth Veitch, 'Unemployment and the Obligatory Dimension of Social Rights', in Social Rights in the Welfare State: Origins and Transformations, ed. by Toomas Kotkas, Kenneth Veitch (Abingdon: Rutledge, 2017), pp. 58-76. =Subsequent litigation= On 19 March 2013, before the appeal to the Supreme Court was completed, the Government also passed the Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Act 2013 to retrospectively make its unlawful sanctions against benefits claimants legal, in order to avoid potentially having to repay unlawfully withheld benefits payments of around ¬£130m. In response to the law- change, the law firm acting for Reilly and Wilson, Public Interest Lawyers, lodged submissions to the Supreme Court, arguing that 'the actions of the secretary of state ‚Ä¶ represent a clear violation of article 6 [of the European Convention on Human Rights] and the rule of law, as an interference in the judicial process by the legislature'. On Friday 4 July 2014, Mrs Justice Lang, sitting at the High Court in London, ruled that the retrospective nature of the legislation interfered with the \\"right to a fair trial\\" under Article Six of the Convention on Human Rights. The government appealed this ruling, but on 29 April 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the previous court's decision; Lord Justice Underhill, summarising the court's findings, emphasised that although the Act was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, 'it is up to the Government, subject to any further appeal, to decide what action to take in response'.Press Association Money News, 'Government loses latest round of legal battle over its back-to-work schemes', (29 April 2016).

Design and development Through the 1960s Paul Siebert's company had built Kaiser Ka 6 gliders under licence. Anticipating the end of this agreement, they began to design a successor with a relatively low cost and simple wooden structure but with performance enhanced by a more modern Wortmann wing profile. The outcome was the Sie 3, which first flew in September 1968. The Sie-3 has a wooden structure and is largely plywood covered. The high set single spar wings have the same aerodynamic profile throughout, with an unswept centre section of parallel chord and constant thickness over 60% of the span and strongly straight tapered panels outboard. There are aluminium Schempp-Hirth airbrakes near mid-chord on the outer centre section, just behind the spar, and ailerons on the outer panels. The only fabric covering on the wing is over the centre section aft of the spar. The fuselage is a ply covered semi-monocoque with a short glass fibre nose fairing; aft of the wing it gently tapers towards the tail. The single piece canopy blends into the fuselage profile. The narrow chord swept fin is an integral ply covered part of the fuselage carrying a broad, fabric covered rudder with a near vertical trailing edge that extends to the fuselage keel. A straight tapered, largely fabric covered all moving tailplane with a cut-out for rudder movement is mounted at the base of the fin. The Sie 3 lands on a monowheel well embedded within the fuselage, aided by a sprung tailskid. The Sie-3 flew for the first time in September 1968, piloted by its designer. Its performance was similar to contemporary wooden gliders. Operational history Siebert manufactured 27 Sie 3s in the four years after it received type approval in January 1972. Some were built by amateurs from kits. In 2010 twelve remained on the civil registers of European countries, seven in Germany, two in Denmark and one each in the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal. In addition, there is one in the United States.

The film was produced by Sandon Berg with Israel Ehrisman as co-producer and starred Chad Edward Bartley as Dylan, Gaetano Jones as Kenneth Sparks and Jeff Castle as Demetrius Stone. The film was distributed by United Gay Network. This film was inspired by Michaelangelo Antonioni's film L'Avventura and adds a gay twist. Synopsis Phoenix is the story of a suspenseful and mysterious journey of two jilted lovers following the trail of their mutual betrayer. Ken Sparks (played by Gaetano Jones) has had some urgent business matter to attend in Phoenix, Arizona after a land deal has gone sour. In the process, he is also leaving behind his boyfriend Dylan (Chad Edward Bartley), making promises for Dylan's birthday. Despite Dylan having delusions that Ken might me the one for him, Ken on the other hand does not want Dylan to join him in Phoenix. Betrayed by false promises, Dylan asks about him and discovers not only that Ken has altogether disappeared from the scene, but that he has had a long-term and ongoing relationship with his \\"husband\\" Demetrius Stone (Jeff Castle). Now Ken has also dumped Demetrius as well and disappeared. Seeing the joint predicament both lovers are in because of Ken's betrayal of them both, Dylan and Demetrius feel an affinity building up between them and eventually fall in love together. The film is subtitled as \\"Every broken heart is a chance for a new beginning...\\" or as Dylan says to Demetrius: \\"maybe this is destiny, and maybe this whole thing with Ken was just to bring us together\\" although they both obviously live in the spell of their common lover. And as they admit, \\"this is not easily done\\" and is \\"an awful lot of trouble to go through\\" and realizing this new love \\"cannot replace him [Ken]\\".

Rio 2016 =Match against Franklin G√≥mez= At the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Navruzov faced Franklin G√≥mez of Puerto Rico. G√≥mez and Navruzov were tied 5‚Äì5 in the second round. As the fight was about to end, G√≥mez made a move that took Navruzov outside of the ring, initially warranting two points for G√≥mez. However, one of the officers argued that the move favored Navruzov, forcing G√≥mez' corner to challenge the call. When the officers decided against him, the bout ended 8‚Äì5 for Navruzov. Shortly after the fight, at least three officers in charge of the match were suspended by United World Wrestling because of \\"suspicious officiating\\".

In response, Navruzov was awarded a penalty point for Mandakhnaran \\"failing to engage\\" during the end of the match, which resulted in Navruzov winning the bronze due to scoring the last point. The Mongolian coaches protested the point, which could not be challenged, by stripping in front of the judges on the mat, resulting in a shoe being sent into the judges' table.

It is located in Region F of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Vrededorp is situated on the North-Western side of Johannesburg and is 1,764 m (5,788 ft) above sea level. The adjacent suburb of Pageview, along with the part of Vrededorp populated by non-whites, south of 11th Street, were commonly and onomatopoeically known as \\"Fietas\\" after the Men's Outfitters that traded from 14th street in Vrededorp - hence \\"Fitters\\" and \\"Fittas\\" or, as commonly spelled, \\"Fietas\\". The then well-known 14th street was the area's business lane where everybody from across Johannesburg met to snatch up bargains. Most shopkeepers stayed in apartments on top of their shops. Vrededorp is sometimes incorrectly regarded as being synonymous with Fietas, however, the bulk of Vrededorp (unlike Pageview) was always a white area, and not a part of Fietas. History 14th Street as it looks like today Vrededorp (\\"Village of Peace\\"), was named as such in 1895 because of the decision taken to give poor people squatter rights in the area. The idea was that these rights could later be transferred to the heirs of the people that were granted initial squatter rights. After the Anglo Boer War (11 Oct 1899- 31 May 1902), the British did away with the arrangement. On 19 February 1896 Vrededorp, Braamfontein, Fordsburg and the Malay Location (later renamed Pageview) were flattened as a result of a huge explosion caused by a locomotive that reversed into two railway trucks that contained 1955 tons of unstable dynamite. This explosion is commonly known as the \\"Great Dynamite Explosion\\". In 1908 the Indigency Commission started to criticize the living conditions of blacks in and around Johannesburg. This triggered a series of inter-related events. 1909 - the Johannesburg Municipal Commission suggested to make surveyed land available to \\"natives and other non Europeans\\". 1910 - Despite strong objections from the black community that they will be excluded from constitutional proceedings, the Union of South-Africa comes into being. Shortly after, in 1911, the first of many labour disputes happened. The next to follow was the founding of the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) in 1912, which later changed its name to African National Congress (ANC). By 1914 the situation deteriorated to such an extent that the Union Government had to place Johannesburg under Martial Law. By 1920 strikes and riots were at the order of the day and on the 29th of February a group of black people riot close to Vrededorp. In 1923 the Native (Urban Areas) Act is passed. This Act forced local authorities to take responsibility for the housing of Black citizens who live and work in their areas. By 1927 the Western Native Township was extended by an extra 1000 houses. The responsibility for the management of Native Affairs moved from the town's Parks Department to the Town Council. They appointed Graham Ballenden to fulfill this role. This appointment made him responsible for the black communities' housing. Soon after, the Johannesburg Council appointed a committee to take care of the Native Affairs. By 1928 the Eastern Native Township and the Wemmer Barracks Hostel were created. By 1930 the total number of houses built in the Eastern and Western Townships reached 2625. An amendment to the Native (Urban Areas) Act, saw to it that the Local Authorities gained additional power over the housing of the black residents. The Johannesburg City Council acquired a portion of the farm Klipspruit (No.8, sized 1300 morgen) to build housing for blacks. The Native Affairs Committee went about launching a competition for the planning of a Township. They named the Township after Orlando Leake, their Chairman. The Township had to be able to accommodate 80,000 persons. The idea was to resolve the overcrowded conditions in areas such as Vrededorp, Fordsburg, Pageview and Sophiatown. By the end of 1935, 3000 houses were built in Orlando. By 1939 an additional 8700 houses and 6912 beds were provided to blacks living and working in Johannesburg. In September this year South Africa declared war on Germany. During the next 5 years, influx control regulations were relaxed. Growing work opportunities attracted many blacks from rural areas to the city. However, only 873 new houses and 358 extra beds were provided due to a scarcity of funds. As a direct result of this, informal settlements started going up all over the area. These areas eventually housed in the region of 60,000 people. In 1947 an attempt was made to close down the informal settlements. Baragwanath Hospital were allocated to serve the blacks and 1800 patients moved there from Johannesburg General Hospital. By 1955 a Resettlement Board was formed to remove blacks from Johannesburg's Western Areas. Shortly after over 60,000 people from the neighbouring area Sophiatown (now known as Triomf) were removed from their homes at gun-point, and resettled in the area now known as Soweto. These houses were then made available to predominantly low- income Afrikaner families. The area was never truly multiracial, as whites lived north of 11th Street, while Coloureds, Malays, and Indians lived in the area south of that street, and in adjacent Pageview. The Apartheid Government declared Vrededorp and Pageview as a white area in 1962. Subsequently, the area was cleared of non-whites by the 1970s. Many homes were bulldozed, and housing for white people was built on some of the land, with large parts remaining undeveloped. Some buildings, such as the '23rd Street Mosque', remain. To date no land claims were settled in the area. Due to the uncertainty around the land claims the suburb is in a state of gross neglect. The settling of land claims is complicated further by the number of claims lodged. The problem is that there are more claims than there are properties in the area.

Filming commenced at the 1995 Golden Gloves competition, the first year the tournament was open to female participants, a group which included Bankowsky herself.

After meeting with Barbara Buttrick, founder of the WIBF, who was in the process of starting a global database of women interested in the sport, Bankowsky came across footage of Rijker and decided she would be the perfect subject for her film. At the time, Rijker had left her native the Netherlands to pursue an acting career in Los Angeles. She had been the kickboxing champion of Europe for 14 years and had wanted to retire from fighting, but Bankowsky telephoned her and convinced her that she would be the first world champion of women's boxing if she chose to pursue it.

The PSCF installation package was released on May 2, 2012. At the same time, source code was published on GitHub. The publishers, PF2 Securities Evaluations and Public Sector Credit Solutions, said that they released the software in response to the need for \\"transparent, objective and up-to-date government credit ratings.\\" The project has similar goals to an earlier mass collaboration bond rating effort, Wikirating. Description PSCF calculates government default probabilities through the use of a multi-year fiscal simulation and a default point, expressed in terms of a user-specified financial ratio. The proportion of simulation trials surpassing the default point represents the default probability for a given year. The simulation is typically created in an Excel worksheet. Each row of the worksheet represents a different user specified series. Series may contain random numbers, macroeconomic variables, revenues, expenditures and debt levels. In a typical simulation, random numbers are listed first, then macroeconomic variables are specified as functions of the random variables (as well as constants and previous levels of the macroeconomic variable). Revenues and expenditures can then be expressed as functions of the macroeconomic variables. =Antecedents= The use of a fiscal simulation as a tool for rating government bonds appears to be unique to PSCF. However, simulation has been used as a tool for rating other fixed income assetsJohn M. Griffin, Jordan Nickerson and Dragon Yongjun Tang, Rating Shopping or Catering? An Examination of the Response to Competitive Pressure for CDO Credit Ratings and fiscal simulations have been used by some budget authorities.Dan Crippen, Countering Uncertainty in Budget Forecasts Technology The framework combines a user interface written in Microsoft Excel with a processing engine written in GNU C. Developers have expressed an intention to support a full open source run- time environment. According to PSCF's creators, Excel was chosen as the initial user interface platform because of its popularity in the financial community. The PSCF user enters model parameters in Excel and then launches a control panel implemented in Excel VBA. When the user runs an analysis from within the control panel, his or her entries are converted to a C program, which is then compiled and executed. Outputs from the C program are returned to new tabs in the Excel workbook. The C program performs a multi-year budget simulation using random number generation routines from the open source Boost C++ Library.Boost C++ Library, \\"http://www.boost.org\\" Version 1.1 released in May 2013 added support for multi-threading, accelerating calculations on systems with multiple processors or multiple cores. History The initial release of PSCF was accompanied by sample rating models for the United States and for the state of California. A preliminary model for Italy was published in July 2012. After its release, the framework received coverage on The Financial Times Alphaville web site.Joseph Cotterill, \\"Monte Carlo-simulated sovereign credit\\", FTAlphaville, May 2, 2012 Reporter Joseph Cotterill noted that the framework had the potential to produce \\"a view of sovereign credit free of the subjectivity and bias that could creep into more qualitatively- based ratings judgements.\\" The framework was also covered in Government Technology News,Raju Shanbhag, \\"PF2 Securities Unveils Open Source Government Bond Rating Tool\\", Government Technology News, May 4, 2012 in The Bond Buyer,Robert Slavin, \\"Free Muni Rating Program Released\\", The Bond Buyer, May 4, 2012 and on Shareable.net,Michel Bauwens, \\"Open-Source Platform Adds Transparency to Municipal Credit Rating\\", Shareable.net, August 8, 2012 among other publications.

Delegates from all over Germany gathered for the first time on 6 December 1947 that entered together body. Their main demand was the key to a German government.Lexikom A‚ÄìZ in zwei B√§nden, Erster Band, Volkseigener Verlag Enzyklop√§die, Leipzig 1956, S. 375. The SED presented their all-German claim to the three people's congresses. Historical background After the Second World War, the cooperation of the four victorious powers was soon superseded by the East-West confrontation. The growing East-West conflict between the USSR and the Western powers, such as the Middle East and Asia, as well as Soviet policy, satellite states to build (the so-called Eastern Bloc), led to distrust of Western powers in relation to the Soviet policy in Germany. U.S. demands in the Allied Control Council, to preserve the economic unity of Germany, were dismissed in July 1946 by the USSR as an attempt to influence. The four-power administration over Germany ended no later than the last meeting of the Supervisory Council on 20 March 1948. The London 6-Power Conference was set in the first half of 1948 principles for the establishment of a democratic German state (the Frankfurt documents). While in the three western zones of the reconstruction of democracy was, went in the Soviet zone of occupation, the increasing uniformity of the semi-free elections in the Soviet zone in 1946 elected democratic institutions vonstatten. Since not freely elected governments in the Soviet countries were reached, the Prime Minister summarized in the west of Koblenz decisions, according to which democratic West German state as a temporary part to the restoration of German unity should be established in the wild. People's Congress movement The People's Congress movement was at the initiative of the Socialist Unity Party 26 November founded in 1947 and served as its first political forum for Germany to incorporate elements of direct democracy and civic groups in a representative government. They also used the SED to the involvement of political parties, mass organizations, cultural associations and individuals to achieve their political goals and was directed against the American and British policy and the Marshall Plan. Emerged from the movement of the German people's congresses, the first on 6/7 December 1947 of \\"delegates\\" of all occupation zones was composed. Prohibited under review and resistances against these SED initiative on the part of the Christian Democratic Union, and the removal of its chairman Jakob Kaiser and Ernst Lemmer through SMAD Western occupying powers to mobilize the People's Congresses in \\"Trizonia\\". First Congress Participants of the first People's Congress, Admiralspalast, Berlin The First German People's Congress for Unity and a Just Peace went back to the initiative of the SED. It let delegates from political parties and mass organizations to determine who came predominantly from the Soviet zone of occupation. Only a small proportion came from the western zones. These representatives came on 6 and 7 December 1947 in Berlin together. Participation in the People's Congress, was among the parties in the Soviet zone of much discussion. The refusal of the CDU to participate was one of the reasons that led to the dismissal of Jacob Kaiser as CDU chairman by the SMAD. Under strong pressure from the occupying power against the will of the majority of national associations, the Liberal Democratic Party decided to participate. The crucial point of criticism was that the Congress should not be composed according to the election results. By including the mass organizations had a higher distribution of members of the SED, which were usually also members of mass organizations, possible from the outset. According to estimates by Erich Gniffke was due to the political affiliation of most members of mass organizations to the SED 62% of the participant member of the SED, and another 10% member of the Communist Party. Although these estimates are at odds with the official figures (see table) are available, it is clear that the SED had a clear majority in the People's Congress. Topics included the rejection of the planned construction of a West German state and the criticism of the US-British occupation policy. They discussed the preparation of a peace treaty and an all-German government \\"composed of representatives of all democratic parties\\". Here, the Congress rejected much of the Soviet policy on Germany and supported this. This is the reason why this motion was approved by the Soviet Military Administration and supported by the SED. To represent the Congress appointed a 17-member delegation to the London Conference of Foreign Ministers (November‚ÄìDecember 1947) the positions of the Congress. The foreign minister saw no legitimacy of the delegation and did not receive it. Second congress The Second German People's Congress held on 17-18. March 1948. The appointment was with 18 March at the 100th Anniversary of the revolution 1848/1849 set. At the People's Congress was attended by 1898 delegates, including 512 from the western zones.Institut f√ºr Marxismus-Leninismus beim Zentralkomitee der SED: Geschichte der deutschen Arbeiterbewegung, Band 6, Von 1945 bis 1949.

Okapis are found only in the Democratic Republic of Congo and are seen as the major flagship species of the Ituri Forest. The OCP has about one hundred staff members and one hundred and ten government rangers under the direction of the Institute in Congo for the Conservation of Nature. The Okapi Conservation Project is partnered with the Wildlife Conservation Network. OCP's founder John Lukas is also a founding member of the Wildlife Conservation Network. In 1992 the project helped create the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, encompassing 13,700 square kilometers of the Ituri Forest, which was designated as a United Nations World Heritage Site in 1996. 2012 attack In June 2012 the headquarters for the Okapi Wildlife Reserve was taken over by poachers, intent on retaliating against the staff who had been stopping their elephant poaching and mining operations. Six guards and other staff as well as 14 okapis were killed in the incident. The local village was looted, women were raped and the conservation center was burned down. Programs =Okapi Wildlife Reserve= The Okapi Wildlife Reserve ‚Äì an area 13,700 square kilometers, about one-fifth of the Ituri Forest ‚Äì was created with the help of the Okapi Wildlife Project in 1992. The project continues to support the reserve by training and equipping wildlife guards and by providing assistance to improve the lives of neighboring communities. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in 1996, and since 1997 it has been listed as a World Heritage Site in danger. =Agro- forestry= The program provides farmers with resources to make their farmland more productive, thus decreasing farmers' need for forest land. The program also works to reforest unused areas. =Conservation education and community assistance= OCP offers an education team that travels throughout the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, providing workshops, lectures, and presentations on the importance of biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of forest resources. The team also distributes education materials to all of the twenty- three schools in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve. They also assist in school construction. =Other projects= Other projects include finding alternatives to hunting bush meat, such as raising tilapia and cane rats. Another activity is providing air surveillance and wildlife guard response to stop illegal activities in the reserve.

In a racing career which lasted from June 1992 to October 1995 she ran twenty-two times winning six races and being placed eight times. Sayyedati was one of the leading two-year-old fillies in Europe in 1992, recording Group One successes in the Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh and the Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. After being beaten on her three-year-old debut, Sayyedati won the Classic 1000 Guineas. She went on to become a successful international performer over a mile, winning the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville in 1993 and the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood as a five-year-old. She was also placed in several major races including the Breeders' Cup Mile. Sayyedati was retired from racing to become a broodmare at the end of her five-year-old season. Background Sayyedati was a bay filly bred in England by Maktoum Al Maktoum's Gainsborough Stud. She was owned by Maktoum's friend Mohamed Obaida, a Dubai-based property developer. Sayyedati was one of the best horses sired by Shadeed who won the 2000 Guineas and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1985. Her dam, Dubian finished third to Oh So Sharp and Triptych in the 1985 Epsom Oaks and was a half-sister of the triple Champion Hurdler See You Then. Apart from Sayyedati, Dubian produced several other winners including Golden Snake, whose victories included Group One races in France, Italy and Germany. The filly was trained throughout her career by Clive Brittain at his Carlburg stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1992: two-year-old season= Sayyedati began her career by finishing second in a six furlong maiden race at Ascot in June. She finished two lengths behind the odds-on favourite and eight lengths clear of the third- placed finisher. A month later, Sayyedati was moved up in class for the Group Three Cherry Hinton Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket. She started 6/4 favourite and won from Toocando, Mystic Goddess and Niche. Sayyedati was then sent to Ireland to contest the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh in September. Racing over seven furlongs on soft ground she won by one and a half lengths from Bright Generation. The Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket three and a half weeks later saw Sayyedati ridden for the first time by Walter Swinburn, who became her regular jockey. The race pitted Sayyedati against Lyric Fantasy, a sprinter who had defeated older horses in the Nunthorpe Stakes, and Poker Chip, the winner of the Flying Childers Stakes. Sayyedati led from the start and ran on strongly in the closing stages to beat Lyric Fantasy by two lengths. Despite Sayyedati's win at Newmarket, she was beaten by Lyric Fantasy for the title of European champion two-year-old filly at the Cartier Racing Awards, but was the clear winter favourite for the following year's 1000 Guineas. =1993: three-year-old season= Sayyedati began her three-year-old season on April 13 at Newmarket in the Nell Gwyn Stakes, a trial for the 1000 Guineas. She started the 11/8 favourite but was unable to catch the front-running Niche, and finished third, beaten one and a half lengths. After the race Brittain expressed his confidence in the filly's capacity to improve, and Swinburn elected to keep the ride on Sayyedati in the upcoming Classic, despite having the opportunity to switch to another fancied runner. Sayyedati and Niche met for the third time in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course sixteen later. Brittain took extra precautions in the run-up to the race: Sayyedati's temperature was taken regularly, her manger was scrubbed between meals and her groom spent the night before the big race sleeping in her stable. In a field of twelve fillies, Sayyedati started second favourite on 4/1 with the French-trained Elizabeth Bay being made favourite. The filly appeared nervous before the race but Brittain was reportedly unconcerned, commenting that \\"only wooden horses don't sweat\\". Sayyedati started slowly but made progress in the second half of the race to overtake Niche a furlong from the finish. The filly was driven out by Swinburn to beat the Nell Gwyn winner by half a length with the outsider Ajfan in third, Lyric Fantasy sixth and Elizabeth Bay eighth. After a break of three months, Sayyedati returned to race against colts and older horses in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. Starting at odds of 11/1, Sayyedati finished strongly to finish second to the French colt Bigstone, ahead of a field which included Culture Vulture, Inchinor and Zafonic. In August, Sayyedati traveled to France for the Prix Jacques Le Marois and recorded her fourth Group One success, beating Ski Paradise and Kingmambo in a closely contested finish. On her final European start of the year she finished fourth behind the colts Bigstone, Barathea and Kingmambo in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. She was then sent to California for the Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita Park in November. Rather than contesting the mile, she was brought down in distance for the Breeders' Cup Sprint over six furlongs on dirt, reportedly at the insistence of Maktoum Al Maktoum. She was never in contention and finished unplaced behind Cardmania. =1994: four-year-old season= Sayyedati remained in training as a four-year-old, but failed to win in six races during a season in which Brittain's entire stable of horses appeared to run below expectations. In spring she was sent to Japan where she finished third to Ski Paradise in the Group Two Keio Hai Spring Cup and seventh behind North Flight in the Yasuda Kinen. On her return to Europe she finished fourth to Distant View in the Sussex Stakes (looking unlucky not to finish closer) and then produced her best performance of the year in the Prix Jacques Le Marois, finishing second to East of the Moon, with Ski Paradise and Barathea fifth and sixth. Her last two starts were disappointing as she finished unplaced in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. =1995: five-year-old season= Despite her lack of success in 1994, Sayyedati returned to the racecourse as a five-year-old mare. On her first appearance she moved down to Group Three level for the first time since April 1993 when she finished second by a head to the sprinter Cherokee Rose in the 1400m Prix du Palais-Royal at Longchamp in May. A month later, she appeared at Royal Ascot for the first time and finished fifth in the Queen Anne Stakes. In July, Sayyedati ran in the Sussex Stakes for the third time. Ridden by the Australian jockey Brett Doyle the mare was towards the rear in the early stages before taking the lead approaching the final furlong. She was pushed out by Doyle in the closing stages to win by half a length from the favourite Bahri. In August, Sayyedati contested her third Prix Jacques Le Marois. Doyle found himself in the lead on Sayyedati 300m from the finish, but the British mare hung to the left in the closing stages and was beaten a length by the outsider Miss Satamixa. Doyle admitted that he had gone to the front earlier than he had planned. A month later she returned to France for the Prix du Moulin in which she finished strongly to take fourth place, less than two lengths behind the winner Ridgewood Pearl. Sayyedati's second Breeders' Cup was more successful than her first, as she finished third to Ridgewood Pearl in the Breeders' Cup Mile at Belmont Park. Assessment In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sayyedati an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Clive Brittain called her \\"a great horse and a pleasure to train. She had speed, class and a great heart.\\" Stud record Sayyedati was retired to become a broodmare for the Gainsborough Stud. She produced several winners, the best of them being the unbeaten colt Almushahar (sired by Silver Hawk), who won the Champagne Stakes on his second and final racecourse appearance. Sayyedati died in August 2007 at the age of 17. *1997 Lemarate (USA) : Bay colt, foaled 21 February, by Gulch (USA) ‚Äì placed 6 times from 40 starts in Britain 2000‚Äì2004 *1998 Djebel Amour (USA) : filly, foaled 1 January, by Mt Livermore (USA) - *1999 Cunas (USA) : Bay filly, foaled 20 March, by Irish River (FR) ‚Äì won 1 race from 2 starts in England 2002 *2000 Almushahar (USA) : Bay colt (fourth foal), foaled 7 April, by Silver Hawk (USA) ‚Äì won 2 races including G2 Champagne Stakes, Doncaster from 2 starts in England 2002 *2001 Hyper Delight (USA) : colt by Silver Hawk (USA) *2003 Lonely Ahead (USA) : Bay filly, foaled 10 February, by Rahy (USA) ‚Äì won 1 race and 4th G2 Lowther Stakes, York from 5 starts in England 2005 *2005 Sayyedati Symphony (USA) : Bay filly, foaled 15 May, by Gone West (USA) ‚Äì placed 3 times including 4th LR Pretty Polly Stakes, Newmarket from 7 starts in England 2007-8 *2007 Sayyedati Storm (USA) : Bay filly, foaled 22 February, by Storm Cat (USA) ‚Äì unplaced in 3 starts in England 2010 Pedigree References Category:1990 racehorse births Category:2007 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 9-c Category:1000 Guineas winners ","title":"Sayyedati"},{"id":"36697507","text":"David Gilman may refer to: * David Gilman (writer), English television writer and novelist * David Gilman (athlete) (born 1954), American luger and sprint canoer ","title":"David Gilman"},{"id":"36697536","text":"The Norman Aviation Nordic 8 Mini Explorer is a Canadian ultralight aircraft, designed and produced by Norman Aviation of Saint-Anselme, Quebec.

Almost none of these rebatements are found in fact of heraldic practice, however, and in British heraldry the stains find only exceptional use, other than for purposes of livery.Fox-Davies (1909), pp. 72-73. Murrey Murrey in color & hatching Murrey (deriving from late Middle English, via Old French from Medieval Latin moratus, from morum 'mulberry') is mulberry-coloured, or reddish purple. The murrey colour used in coats of arms & armorials should be clearly darker than purpure and stand out from it, to approximately the same extent that sanguine is darker than Gules and brun√¢tre from tenn√©. A good comparison between the two tinctures could be obtained from comparing the murrey in the coat of arms of the University of Wales, with the lion purpure adorning the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Le√≥n. Sanguine Sanguine in color & hatching Sanguine (deriving from Middle English, from French sanguin(e) 'of blood', from Latin sanguineus 'of blood', from sanguis, sanguin- 'blood') is a brownish red, or blood-red colour. It is due to be darker than Gules, the regular red, from approximately the same extent as murrey to purpure, and brun√¢tre from tenn√©. It can also be used for the depiction of animals said √©corch√© ('scorched') in French heraldry, although this is very rarely used among the already rare occurrences of blazons depicting bleeding animals, on which the regular Gules is used instead. Tenn√© Tenn√© in color & hatching Tenn√© (deriving mid-16th century from an obsolete French variant of Old French tan√©) (sometimes termed tawny) is an orange-tawny colour, though orange is considered distinct in continental European and African heraldic traditions. Called tann√© in modern and actual French heraldry, it refers to the leather tanning process and to the color the finished product is said to have, hence the name tann√© ('tanned'). Being the initial shade of brown available by itself in heraldry, its hatching form naturally took the shape of red and green lines mixed together. Tenn√© is expected to be slightly darker than Gules, clearly darker than orange, but lighter than brunatre (dark brown), sanguine (dark red), murrey (dark purple) & sable (black). Historical examples Flag of the Second Spanish Republic (1931‚Äì1939) * The University of Wales, established in 1893, adopted a coat of arms blazoned: Argent on a fesse murrey three medieval lamps Or all within a bordure of the second charged with eight mullets of the third. * The flag of the Second Spanish Republic, adopted in 1931, was a tricolor of gules, or and murrey ().

It was active from 10 October 1949 and 28 May 1953 and it was legitimated by the Potsdam Agreement between the Allies.  History  In 1949, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SMAD), which had been previously the main authority in the Soviet occupation zone, transferred its powers to the German administrative institutions in sight of the foundation of an independent republic in East Germany. When the German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in October 1949, the SMAD was dismantled and reorganized as the Soviet Control Commission, giving more independence to the GDR government. As Supreme Commander of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany and SMAD leader, General Vasily Chuikov oversaw the establishment of the SKK and he became head of it shortly thereafter. After the death of Joseph Stalin, the Commission became known as the \\"High Commission of the USSR in Germany\\". The former political adviser to General Chuikov, Vladimir Semyonov, was appointed as the High Commissioner. The apparatus of the High Commissioner had a decisive role in suppressing the anti-government protests which began in East Berlin and covered the entire territory of the German Democratic Republic in June 1953 (see East German uprising of 1953). The USSR abolished the Commission on 20 September 1955 after the recognizing of the \\"full sovereignty\\" of the GDR.Hans-Ulrich Wehler: Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte, Bd. 5: Bundesrepublik Deutschland und DDR 1949‚Äì1990, C.H. Beck, M√ºnchen 2008, S. 31. However, the Soviet government had continued to exercise its political influence through its embassy in East Berlin and the presence of Red Army troops in the East German territory.Klaus Schroeder: Der SED-Staat ‚Äì Partei, Staat und Gesellschaft 1949‚Äì1990, 1998, S. 131 f.  Functions  If the decisions made by the GDR government were considered against Soviet directives or Marxist-Leninist principles, the SKK was authorized to overrule each decision. Local officials had little revision power on the decisions. The Soviet Control Commission had controlled both the federal government of the GDR and each local state government, and it had been considered as the ultimate authority in both the Soviet zone and in the former East Germany.G√ºnther Heydemann: Die SBZ- und DDR-Forschung im Institut f√ºr Zeitgeschichte, in: Horst M√∂ller, Udo Wengst (Hrsg.): 50 Jahre Institut f√ºr Zeitgeschichte. Eine Bilanz, Oldenbourg, M√ºnchen 1999, , S. 469‚Äì486, hier S. 479. The SKK monitored the implementation of the Potsdam agreements and of the other Allied decisions in the GDR. Members of the Soviet Control commission had to represent the interests of the Soviet Union in the GDR, but at the same time they also supported the leading Socialist Unity Party of Germany in its actions against internal and external political opponents.

Career Eastman is best known for a distinctive monochromatic style. Images held in shallow relief depictions remain nearly invisible until the spectator is positioned correctly for light to throw the images into relief, reflecting changing tone and colour. This technique was probably most successfully used in his monumental ‚ÄúHorse‚Äù, 2005.http://www.artthrob.co.za/08aug/artbio.html In 2007, Eastman presented 'Supernature' at Cape Town gallery whatiftheworld. The naturalistic, rich and startling large-scale series of enamel and acrylic paintings on aluminium sheets, depicted the portraits of various owl species relating to themes of superstition and luck.http://www.artthrob.co.za/08aug/artbio.html In 2010, Eastman exhibited a series of black portraits at Primo Marella gallery in Milan, Italy, curated by Yacouba Konat√©. Eastman was selected alongside 17 International artists to produce a poster for The 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Later that year the work was auctioned at Phillips de Pury in New York City.

Greenwood Press, Biography Francine Stephanie Barron was born in Binghamton, New York, and grew up in Washington D.C., the youngest of six sisters. She graduated from Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School, then earned a degree at Princeton University in European History. While there, she wrote for the university newspaper, which led to later jobs with The Miami Herald and The San Jose Mercury News. She pursued an MA at Stanford University in Latin American History, but left to work at the CIA for several years as an intelligence analyst. After the publication of her first book, she started writing full-time, citing John McPhee (who taught her at Princeton) and Elizabeth George as particular influences. She lives in Denver, Colorado, with her children and husband. Her husband, Mark, is a prominent lawyer in the area. Her eldest son, Sam, also went on to study at Princeton. Her youngest son, Stephen, went on to study at Penn State and is on the fencing team. Writing As Francine Mathews, she has written two series: one set in Nantucket featuring police officer Meredith \\"Merry\\" Folger, the latest in a long line of police officers in her family, including her father who is also her boss. Indeed, family and genealogy play an important part of the series. Mathews has stated that with this series she tried to \\"capture the difficult life in New England today\\" and the \\"bitter and embedded economic issues\\" facing the fishing industry. Her second series are spy thrillers based on her time working with the CIA. As Stephanie Barron (her middle and maiden names), Mathews has written historical novels featuring the English novelist Jane Austen (1775‚Äì1817) as an amateur sleuth. The books are presented as lost diaries merely edited by Barron. Mathews has carried out considerable research into Austen as background to the series, especially using Austen's correspondence as a key source.

The film shows the earlier years of Alexei Peshkov, better known as Soviet's famous Maxim Gorky; it takes the audience through Alexei's experience at his maternal grandparent's home in the town of Nizhni-Novogorod. Alexei interacts with family members, workers of his grandfather's dye factory and local orphan children, all of which impact him.Phoenix Cinema: The Childhood of Maxim Gorky, Re-linked 2019-08-25Filmaffinity: The Childhood of Maxim Gorky, Re-linked 2019-08-25 This film was in 1939 followed by two films covering the second and third parts of his autobiography: My Apprenticeship (based on In the World, published 1916) and My Universities (based on My Universities, published 1923). Plot After his father dies, young Alexei (later Maxim Gorky) and his mother Varvara arrive on a boat to live with his mother's parents and brothers. Back at the house, the family celebrates Varvara's return and both Grandmother Akulina and Vanya the gypsy apprentice who works in grandfather's clothing dye shop engage in lovely Russian folk dances. The party comes to an abrupt halt when Grandfather Vasili arrives. A fight breaks out when Alexei's uncles Mikhail and Yakov argue with their father over division of the dye shop. Alexei hides and watches as they overturn tables and punch each other. As time passes, it becomes clear that Alexei's uncles resent Alexei because they believe their inheritance will be jeopardized by their sister's widowhood. They enlist Alexei's young cousin Sacha to play tricks on grandfather and Alexei. Luckily, Alexei forms a close bond with Vanya the gypsy. When grandfather loses his temper and beats Alexei, Vanya puts his hand between the whip and Alexei to soften the blows. Alexei sees Vanya as a father figure and is horrified when Vanya dies unexpectedly carrying a heavy stone cross up a hill. Alexei's uncles arranged for this to happen because they were jealous of Vanya's relationship with grandfather. Varvara eventually leaves Alexei in the care of Grandma Akulina so she can go make a new life for herself. When the dye shop burns down, Alexei and his grandparents move to another town. Grandfather teaches him to read and he befriends a chemist who rents a room from grandfather. An avid reader, he encourages Alexei to learn to write so he can record his grandmother's stories which he describes as quintessentially Russian. He leaves town just before the police arrive to arrest him for incitement against the czar. Alexei sees his grandfather's brother, Grigori begging on the streets in town. When he lost his eyesight, grandfather refused to support him since he couldn't work anymore. Alexei is beaten up by upper class boys who are picking on a poor man. He realizes that he believes strongly in helping those who have less than him. He makes friends with the poorer kids in town and also Alexei, a paralyzed boy who keeps pet insects to maintain a window to the outside world. Alexei is impressed at his namesake's positive attitude and gives him his pet mouse to add to his collection. Varvara returns with a fianc√© and tells Alexei that after she is married in Moscow, she will bring him to live with her for good so he can go to school. Unhappy with this arrangement, Alexei begins to realize he will have to work to support himself and possibly his mother. Grandfather again loses everything and they are forced to move again. Alexei begins earning money by sifting through garbage dumps with his friends looking for metal and rags to sell. He earns just enough each day to pay for food for the family. He is disgusted with his grandfather's weakness and greed and impressed with his grandmother's strength. Sensing Alexei's disgust, grandfather kicks him out and tells him to make his own way in the world. He sees his old friend the chemist marching in a chain gang. It isn implied that he was convicted of crimes against the state, perhaps am early Marxist. He reminds Alexei to learn and write as much as he can. The film ends with grandfather reduced to begging for cake on the street. He is ashamed to bump into his brother Grigori who is also a beggar. Alexei marches off into an open field and waves to friends as he leaves to start his own new life.

It takes into consideration that the autobiography was written by an adult and uses the children to help create ‚Äúwitness‚Äù which allows for the spectators to view the film with the Soviet interpretation. Even with the tweaks that the producer made, the film is based on events that Maxim Gorky wrote about in his autobiography. This includes his family drama and other characters that he meets along the way.Hicks, J., Beumers, B. (2016). Soiuzdetfilm. In A Companion to Russian Cinema. (pp. 117‚Äì136).Wiley-Blackwell. Production Soiuzdetfilm is a film studio that was created specifically made to create films for children. It was founded in 1936 inside of Moscow in hopes for a ‚Äúnew stage in film entertainment for children (Field 1952, 135).‚Äù. Earlier adults would have acted as children in tragic scenes. Donskoy worked well with the child actors as he did not push them into doing too much rehearsal. He believed that it is important to not overwork the child-actors and prevent having to teach the children too much. If the child is ‚Äúovertrained‚Äù they often overact on camera. To get the proper emotions, Donskoy would use personal memories to get the actors into the right mood to show strong emotions in the film.

The film was shot in Nizhni-Novogorod, where Gorky spent his childhood.Flicker Alley: 1950s Review of The Childhood of Maxim Gorky in The Harvard Crimson, Re-linked 2019-08-25 Style The film is presented with multiple mini storylines compared to a single story that describes Maxim's childhood. The different scenes are presented with many characters whether they are friends, family members, merchants, beggars, or clowns; the screen showing the different interactions these characters and others have through both dialogue and actions. Sound The film uses a soundtrack by Lev Shvarts who worked on all three films of the trilogy among many other films. This film uses mostly the actors dialogue for sound and even makes use of a guitar in a few scenes to add music to the film. In other words, the sound in the film is diegetic. This includes one of the first scenes where Alexei's grandmother, Akulina, is dancing. Although majority of the film id diegetic, there are scenes that use external when make the transitions more fluid.

In 1977 a restored version of the film was made and in the new version there was a re-recorded soundtrack. The idea of Hyperkino DVDs is to have a regular version of the film with subtitles in a number of languages and a second version that allows the audience to press on a number and view text in Russian or English along with images/photographs and videos that relate to the particular scene. Riley, J. (2012). Hyperkino Releases. Sight & Sound, 22(10), 116. Influence The film was created after the death of one of Soviets most celebrated novelist Maxim Gorky and based on his autobiography. This film was one of the first to use children actors the way they were allowing the production company Soiuzdetfilm to continue.

It has a sister route 59 which operates on the same route between Middleton and Shaw, and also serves Rushcroft. History Route 58 was originally operated by GM Buses and operated on almost the same route as today. Evening services previously operated between Rochdale and Newhey, provided by Rossendalebus and Bu-Val Buses, although these journeys are now covered by routes 181, 182 and 451. The route has had some variations in the past. The service previously ran to the Trafford Centre via the M60 motorway until August 2008, where it was replaced by route 57 between Oldham and Trafford Centre (57 was withdrawn in January 2010)). The service was extended from Middleton to Bury Interchange on behalf of Transport for Greater Manchester in October 2009, but this was withdrawn in July 2011. Route Buses leave from stand J at Rochdale Interchange before heading along Milnrow Road (A640) towards Firgrove, where the road changes name to Rochdale Road. Buses turn off the A640 into Milnrow town centre via Bridge Street, Dale Street and Newhey Road. The service continues along Newhey Road as it returns onto the A640 to Newhey. Once in Newhey, the 58 branches off onto the A663 Shaw Road as it heads into the Oldham area, heading past Dunwood Park into Shaw and Crompton. The service turns off the A663 into Shaw town centre via Milnrow Road, Market Street and High Street before returning to the A663 Crompton Way at the Big Lamp roundabout. The service then heads towards Oldham via the B6194 travelling through Heyside and Higginshaw, passing close to Salmon Fields. At the junction of the B6194/A62, the service turns onto the A62 to head to the Mumps junction and Oldham Mumps Metrolink station. At this point, the service leaves the A62 and runs through Oldham town centre with the service taking two routes between Princes Street at Mumps and the bus station. Westbound buses run via Union Street, Clegg Street (former bus station), Yorkshire Street and St Mary's Way, while eastbound buses run via St Mary's Way, Lord Street, High Street and Yorkshire Street. Leaving Oldham bus station, buses travel along Middleton Road (A669) through Westwood, Chadderton and Firwood Park. Buses then go past Mills Hill railway station where the A669 road renames to Oldham Road as the service continues to Middleton and terminates at the town's bus station. Vehicles The main type of vehicle used on journeys on route 58 are Volvo B9TL's, which have route branding for the 58 and its sister service, the 59. The main alternative vehicle used on the route is Volvo B7RLE's, which were the previous prominent vehicle on the route.

He was based in Tierra de Campos, and was among the most loyal supporters of King Alfonso VIII of Castile, Berengaria of Castile, and later of King Ferdinand III. Service to the crown A member of the curia regis of King Alfonso VIII of Castile, he was Mayordomo mayor del rey (High Steward) from 1198 until the king's death in 1214. Along with his brothers Rodrigo, Pedro, Nu√±o, and √Ålvaro, he took part in the Battle of Navas de Tolosa which occurred on 16 July 1212. After the death of King Alfonso, he was the High Steward of King Henry I until he was replaced on 29 December 1216 by Mart√≠n Mu√±oz de Hinojosa at the urgings of Count √Ålvaro N√∫√±ez de Lara, who in 1215 had made himself the young king's guardian, contrary to the wishes of the church and the nobility. This led to Gonzalo and his supporters distancing themselves from the crown and joining a party of nobles loyal to the king's sister Berengaria. In February 1216, during the uprising of √Ålvaro N√∫√±ez de Lara, he took part in an extraordinary parliament along with other Castilian nobles including Lope D√≠az de Haro, Alfonso T√©llez de Meneses \\"el Viejo\\", √Ålvaro D√≠az de Cameros, and others, where they agreed, with the support of Berengaria (sister of the young king Henry I), to form a common front against √Ålvaro N√∫√±ez. By the end of May the situation in Castile had become dangerous for Berengaria, so she decided to take refuge in the castle of Autillo de Campos, a property of Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gir√≥n, and sent her son Fernando to the court of Le√≥n and his father, King Alfonso IX. On 15 August 1216 a meeting was held among all the nobility of the Kingdom of Castile to try to reach an accord and avoid civil war, but their disagreements led the families of Gir√≥n, T√©llez de Meneses, and Haro to distance themselves definitively from √Ålvaro N√∫√±ez de Lara. According to the Cr√≥nica latina de los reyes de Castilla, the year 1217 was one of great tension, such as never had occurred in Castile before. √Ålvaro N√∫√±ez de Lara refused to renounce the power he had gained thereto and harassed the forces that remained loyal to Berengaria, laying waste to the valley of Trigueros and besieging Autillo de Campos, where Berengaria and her partisans were located, as well as Cisneros and Frechilla. Circumstances changed suddenly when King Henry died on 6 June 1217 after receiving a head wound from a roof tile that came loose accidentally while he was playing with other children in the palace of the Bishop of Palencia, Tello T√©llez de Meneses. √Ålvaro N√∫√±ez de Lara, as the young king's guardian, tried to keep the matter quiet, bringing the king's body to the castle of Tariego, but he could not prevent the news from reaching Queen Berengaria. Immediately, Berengaria charged Lope D√≠az de Haro, Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gir√≥n, and Alfonso T√©llez de Meneses with the task of discreetly fetching her son Ferdinand, who at the time was in Toro with his father King Alfonso, using as pretext the possibility of an attack on Autillo and without revealing the news of her brother's death. Despite the hesitation of the infantas Sancha and Dulce, the nobles were able to convince the King that King Henry was alive and well, thereupon leaving Toro with Ferdinand. Berengaria, the legitimate heiress to the throne of Castile, renounced it in favor of her son Ferdinand, who shortly thereafter was proclaimed king in Autillo de Campos on 14 June 1217. On 20 September of that year, Alfonso T√©llez de Meneses took √Ålvaro N√∫√±ez de Lara prisoner, and √Ålvaro was obliged to hand over some fortresses. On 11 November a generous truce was signed, allowing members of the House of Lara to recover their liberty and privileges. As soon as he was released from prison, however, √Ålvaro once again defied his enemies Alfonso T√©llez de Meneses, Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gir√≥n, and Lope D√≠az de Haro, but he died while laying siege to them in the fortress of Castrej√≥n de Trabancos, where they had taken refuge after an initial defeat. His brother Fernando N√∫√±ez de Lara made his way to Morocco, where he placed himself in the service of Caliph Yusuf II. The Pact of Toro of 26 August 1218 ratified the truce and put an end to the conflict. Political office and landed estates Ruins of the Monastery of San Rom√°n de Entrepe√±as. The fortified tower, sole vestige of its former splendor, can be seen in the image. Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gir√≥n consolidated his position after the kingdom was once again at peace and the threat posed by Count de Lara and his brothers had faded away. He was High Steward for King Ferdinand III and a distinguished member of the curia regis. He held several feudal estates at different times, including Monz√≥n, Li√©bana, La Pern√≠a, Gat√≥n de Campos, Herr√≠n de Campos, Pe√±as Negras, Cervera, Guardo, half of the important holding Carri√≥n (shared with his brother Rodrigo Rodr√≠guez Gir√≥n), the castle of Torremormoj√≥n, where he succeeded his father in 1194, and the distant castle of Entrepe√±as, near the Monastery of San Rom√°n de Entrepe√±as, in Santib√°√±ez de la Pe√±a. He also held several properties in Boadilla de Rioseco, Carde√±osa de Volpejera, Revenga de Campos, Villasabariego de Ucieza, and Cordovilla. In 1221, King Ferdinand repaid Gonzalo for his loyalty and services rendered by granting him the lordship of Autillo de Campos, a favor later granted his descendants by subsequent monarchs. Charity In 1209, along with his first wife, he founded the Hospital de la Herrada in the district of San Illodo y San Antonino in Carri√≥n on the Way of Saint James, with the purpose of giving alms and lodging to the pilgrims and treating their illnesses. They entrusted its administration to the Diocese of Palencia. Gonzalo died around 1231 and was buried in the Hospital de la Herrada that he founded. Marriages and descendants He first married, around 1185, Sancha Rodr√≠guez (died between 1209 and 1212). In his 1697 study of the Lara family, Luis de Salazar y Castro suggested she was daughter of a Rodrigo Rodr√≠guez appearing in documents without further identifying details, in turn made son of count Rodrigo Gonz√°lez de Lara by the infanta Sancha Alfonso. In this he has been followed by many more recent works. However, a recent survey of the Lara by Antonio S√°nchez de Mora dismisses this connection as being without basis, a deliberate attempt to give the Gir√≥n prominent ancestry. A 13th century pedigree of the patrons of the monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Ferreira de Pallares states that Gonzalo married the daughter of Rodrigo Fern√°ndez de Toro√±o, alf√©rez to the king, and Aldonza P√©rez, daughter of Pedro Mu√±oz de Carri√≥n, a landholder in Aranga and a descendant of the Banu G√≥mez and of the Galician nobleman Pedro Froilaz. An illuminating document, cited by several authors, mentions all of his children from both his marriages, except Gonzalo. On 8 May 1222, in the records of the Palencia Cathedral, Gonzalo, High Steward of the King, in the company of his children and second wife, affirmed that the gift of a hospital in the district of San Zoilo in Carri√≥n, along with all its rights and privileges, was to be restored to Palencia's episcopal see in perpetuity. The children of the first marriage were: *Rodrigo Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n (before 1194‚Äì1256) *Gonzalo Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n (d. 1258), married to Teresa Arias *Teresa Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n, who signed the 1222 document with the consent of her husband Rodrigo Gonz√°lez *Mar√≠a Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n, who signed the document with the consent of her first husband Guill√©n P√©rez de Guzm√°n, son of Pedro Rodr√≠guez de Guzm√°n and Mahalda. Mar√≠a, according to Salazar y Acha, married secondly Gil Vasques de Soverosa, and had children from both marriages. A daughter of the first was Mayor Guill√©n de Guzm√°n, mistress of King Alfonso X. *Aldonza Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n, married by 1222 to Ramiro Fr√≥ilaz, son of Count Froila Ram√≠rez and Sancha Fern√°ndez. *Elvira Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n, who signed the document with the authorization of the abbess of Santa Mar√≠a la Real de Las Huelgas *Sancha Rodr√≠guez Gir√≥n, another nun, who signed it with the permission of the abbess of San Andr√©s de Arroyo *Br√≠gida Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n, a nun in the Abbey of Santa Mar√≠a de la Consolaci√≥n de Perales, who signed with the consent of the abbess Around May 1213, Gonzalo married, for the second time, Marquesa P√©rez, who may have come from the Villalobos or the Manzanedo family, although her parentage has not been confirmed. Together they signed a document of 1222 mentioning the children of this marriage, all of whom were minors at that date. In 1224, along with his wife Marquesa, he donated the church of Santa Mar√≠a de Baquer√≠n to the Hospital de la Herrada which he had founded. The children of this second marriage, who lack the historical relevance of the first, were: *Pedro Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n *Mu√±o Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n *Nu√±o Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n *Mar√≠a Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n (thus bearing the same name as her elder half-sister), wife of Pon√ß I, Count of Urgell, with whom she had two children; Ermengol and √Ålvaro who inherited a significant legacy in the kingdoms of Castile and Le√≥n *Leonor Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n, who married, according to Luis de Salazar y Castro, Gonzalo G√≥mez de Roa, Lord of Aza and Roa, with whom she had three children, one of whom, Juan Gonz√°lez de Roa, became Grand Master of the Order of Calatrava *In√©s Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n *Mayor Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n, possibly the wife of Lope L√≥pez de Haro \\"el Chico\\" son of Lope D√≠az II de Haro.
