It was depopulated in 1948. Location, geography Kafr Sabt was set near the eastern margin of a large plateau, just south of the ancient main road linking the coastal city of Acre with the Jordan Valley and Transjordan. The road descends from the village to the Jordan Valley deep below by following Wadi Fidjdjas, a valley offering the least steep route available. Kafr Sabt benefited of the large springs from Wadi Fidjdjas. HistoryRoman period= While Palestine was part of the Roman Empire, Kafr Sabt was known as Kafar Shabtay.Khalidi, 1992, p.526. =Early Muslim period= Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi mentions the village in 985, while under Abbasid rule as being \\"between Tiberias and Ramla, situated near 'Akabah (the Pass above) Tiberias.al-Muqaddasi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.471. He says that it belonged to Caesarea and was large, populated, and had a mosque on its main street.al-Muqaddasi quoted in Dabbagh, p.647. Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p.526. =Crusader/Ayubid period=Crusader \\"Cafarsset\\" The Crusaders called it \\"Cafarsset\\" when they conquered the Levant in the twelfth century. The village belonged to the Latin abbey of Mount Tabor and one of the abbey's turcopoles originated from Cafarsset. In 1187, Saladin led his Ayyubid army from the Jordan River to Kafr Sabt, approximately from his camp along the Sea of Galilee. Kafr Sabt, located on a high plateau bordering the Horns of Hattin, served as a strategic position for Saladin's army since there he could threaten Tiberias to the rear, Sepphoris in the front, the Crusader lines of communications between the two strongholds, and his army could easily retreat down the slopes if necessary.Lyons, 1984, p. 256 He encamped in Kafr Sabt before he led his army to their decisive victory at the Battle of Hattin.Lyons, 1984, p. 257Lyons, 1984, p. 259. Ayyubid rule Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi passed through the village in the thirteenth century while Kafr Sabt was in Ayyubid hands. =Ottoman period= Kafr Sabt was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and by 1596, it was under the administration of the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Tiberias, part of Sanjak Safad, with a population of 29 Muslim households; an estimated 160 persons. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, cotton, beehives, and goats; a total of 5,700 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 188. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 526Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as K. el Sett.Karmon, 1960, p. 166. Victor Gu√©rin visited in 1875, and noted: \\"Near a spring, inclosed in a small circular basin, the soil is covered with the confused debris of many overthrown houses; some still standing are inhabited. Here and there are scattered cisterns cut in the rock. On the highest point of the hill, formerly occupied by the ancient town, are observed the remains of a strong edifice built of cut stones, which seems to have been put up for military purposes; it formed a quadrilateral forty paces long. Beside a mosque may be remarked two broken capitals in debased Corinthian, as well as several columns belonging probably to an ancient church, now completely destroyed.\\"Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 266-7; as given in Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 394. In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it as a stone-built village with 300 inhabitants.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 360.

In the 1922 census of Palestine, the population of Kufr Sabt was 247; all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table IX, Sub- district of Tiberias, p. 39 increasing in the 1931 census to 340; still all Muslims, in a total of 71 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 84 Agriculture was the main economic sector with the primary crops being grain and fruit orchards.

In 1949, two Jewish settlements, Ilaniya and Sharona feuded over possession of Kafr Sabt's lands, with the former arguing that they deserved compensation for early Arab attacks on their town, while the latter also had designs for it, and took it by force. The Agriculture Minister of Israel intervened ordering Sharona's farmers to retreat.

Life of crime It is probable that Riley's criminality began long before his resignation from the police force and his eventual conviction for drug smuggling.Hickie D. 1985, 174. At trial, barrister Donald Stewart challenged Riley over a fabricated confession in a murder trial and also Riley's offer to destroy the statement if he was paid a bribe. Later, the clearly angry Riley verbally threatened Stewart and then attempted to run him down with his car.Stewart D.G. 2007, Recollections of an Unreasonable Man, Sydney: ABC Books,106-7. In 1962, Riley entered the poker machine and club industry as a manager for Ray Smith, later moving to work for, and then partnering with, Wally Dean. Together Dean and Riley began \\"defrauding licensed clubs by obtaining payment for services not provided\\".NCA-Initial Evaluation 1998,11. Riley's first arrest occurred in New Zealand in 1966, when he attempted to bribe a policeman. He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and later deported.Whitton E. 2015, Can of Worms II, \\"Biographies\\" In 1966, NSW policeman John Wesley Egan initiated the \\"corset gang\\", the first organised heroin trafficking operation from South-East Asia into Australia and the United States.Jiggens, J.1999, The Killer Cop and the Murder of Donald Mackay, West End, Qld. : NIMM, , page 46. It is suggested that Riley and Henry Brian (Harry) Ikin were among the former or serving police officers who participated in the operation, often using fraudulently obtained passports.Clark S.R. 2011, Balancing Privacy and Security in the Australian Passport System Egan was eventually arrested and jailed in the USA. Upon his return to Sydney in 1975, he declared: \\"Organised crime and highly placed policemen are often the same people\\". In 1973, the Moffitt Royal Commission into organised crime dealt extensively with Riley and his alleged associates, including Leonard McPherson. Riley was widely reported to be in Sydney; however, police could not find him. Consequently, he avoided giving evidence before Justice Athol Moffitt who recorded that Riley ‚Äúhad been treated with undue favour by [the police].‚ÄùMorton, J. & S. Lobez 2007, Gangland Australia: Colonial Criminals to the Carlton Crew, Melbourne: Melbourne University Press.,161. Upon recommendation of Moffitt the NSW Police Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) was established in 1974-75 and Riley became one of its priority targets. = Mafia connections and drug running = During the mid-1970s, Riley and Bela Csidei made regular trips to San Francisco to meet with known American Mafia figures and to gain entr√©e to the American underworld. Riley was photographed with Sal Amarena of the Santos Trafficante mafia family.Bob Bottom (1984). Without Fear or Favour (pp. 58-59). Victoria, Australia: Sun Books. Riley also formed links with the Teamsters and Mafia through associations with Rudy Tham.John Pilger (1992). A Secret Country (p. 257). NSW, Australia: Vintage. By 1975, Riley, now known as a criminal heavy who could offer protection from other criminals, had become associated with two emerging Sydney drug traffickers, Michael and Patricia Moylan.NCA-Initial Evaluation 1998,11 Riley and Michael Moylan began to have frequent meetings with the American mobster, James Fratianno and subsequently carried out at least thirty successful importations from America into Australia. Their enterprise used female croupiers employed at Sydney's illegal casino, the ‚ÄúDouble Bay Bridge Club‚Äù, to courier drugs concealed in their corsets. .Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking 1982, Report : vol.2 : Nugan Hand , Canberra : AGPS, 73. This Mafia affiliation also appears to have influenced Australian corporate and criminal interests to move into the drug trade.Australian Prohibition by Alfred McCoy In 1976, the arrest of some of the Moylan's couriers lead to the collapse of the syndicate and caused the Moylans to flee overseas. Riley subsequently arranged his own imports again using the 'Double Bay Bridge Club' couriers.NCA-Initial Evaluation 1998,11-12 In Sydney, Riley formed separate business relationships with Fratianno's former associate George Countis and Harry Sayvanus Wainwright, a fugitive American lawyer, both of whom had settled in Australia in the late 1960s. Countis and Wainwright subsequently introduced Riley to ex- Green Beret and businessman, Michael Hand, co-founder of the Nugan Hand Bank.Bottom R, 1985, \\"The Mafia Connection\\", The Age, 9 September 1985. = Nugan Hand Bank = The Nugan Hand Bank was alleged to have cultivated Sydney criminal networks, corrupt Australian politicians, the CIA, and a network of ex-CIA arms dealers. The bank prospered becoming a bridge between large legitimate banks and organised crime syndicates. It laundered illegal money in drug and arms deals that often financed intelligence operations.McCoy, A. 1972, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade , New York: Harpers and Row, 461-68 Riley's Hong Kong partner was John Doyle, who had connections with senior Triad members linked to the drug markets in Manila, Singapore and Thailand.Butt P. 2015, Merchants of Menace, Sydney: Blackwattle Press, 69 Hand acted upon Riley's advice to open Nugan Hand branches in all three countries, especially Bangkok, \\"to attract drug money\\".McCoy, A. 1972, 463. This was later confirmed by Neil Evans, who ran the bank's Chiang Mai office.Butt, P. 2015, 225. Harry Wainwright maintained a $30,000 float with Nugan Hand with instructions that Murray Riley and fellow drug smuggler, Ken Derley, had use of his money. Consequently, in April 1976, Riley withdrew $15,000 from the Hong Kong branch and personally brought the first consignment of heroin into Brisbane in a false-bottom suitcase.Butt P. 2015, 43. Hand transferred a total of $295,000 to Hong Kong for the benefit of Riley, who used subordinates to smuggle heroin consignments, much of it destined for the Australian market.McCoy, A. 1972, 468. = The Anoa failure = During mid-1978, acting upon underworld chatter about an impending drug importation, the CIU mounted a task force operation involving the Australian Bureau of Narcotics, Commonwealth Police and the Australian armed forces. Riley had earlier planned to smuggle 4.5 tonnes of top grade cannabis from Thailand to Australia aboard the fishing vessel Choryo Maru. When the ageing Choryo Maru developed engine problems, the cannabis was offloaded into the hulk of the Amagi Maru, which had run aground on a reef east of Papua New Guinea. On 23 May 1978, the yacht Anoa, recently purchased in Cairns, set sail to retrieve the stash. Two weeks later, the CIU task force were tracking the Anoa, now loaded with 2.7 tonnes of cannabis, as it sailed the down the East coast of Australia. Riley and his girlfriend, Carol Anne Dean ( wife of Wally Dean),NCA-Initial Evaluation 1998, 12. were also observed as they too shadowed the vessel down the Queensland coast. The crew eventually docked at North Haven wharf on the Camden River, NSW and unloaded the cannabis into two trucks. News of the ensuing police raid and arrests tipped off Riley who, after \\"eluding\\" police for three weeks, was eventually apprehended in Adelaide. In Sydney, he pleaded guilty to a charge of being a \\"transportation agent\\" for 1.5 tonnes of cannabis and received a relatively light sentence of ten years' imprisonment, with possible parole after five years.McCoy A. \\"The Voyage of the Anoa\\" = The criminal milieu = The Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking (1977‚Äì79) accused Riley of being involved in importing heroin from Bangkok in 1977. A 1982 Joint Taskforce on Drug Trafficking found that he had carried out five successful heroin importations in 1976. These events related to Riley's involvement with the Nugan Hand Bank. Riley failed to appear at the enquiry after police conveniently failed to find him. This \\"failure\\" is consistent with the opinion of Evan Whitton (1986), who used additional research from Bob Bottom to outline Australia's \\"criminal milieu\\", which consists of inter-related and overlapping criminal syndicates and their support group consisting of politicians, police, lawyers, businessmen, accountants and the judiciary.Whitton E. & R. Bottom 1986, \\"The Politics of the Criminal Milieu\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 8 April 1986. Similarly, Alfred W. McCoy (1980) has noted that Riley was not without friends during and after the Anoa episode. Nine months after his conviction, Riley was still being held in the more comfortable remand section of Long Bay Jail. A further seven years was added to his sentence when he was subsequently convicted of other major offences including conspiracy to defraud American Express of $274,000. Nevertheless, his continued privileges allowed him the run of Long Bay Jail and excursions outside. Only a protest from the Prison Officers Association forced the cancellation of his transfer to a minimum-security prison at Emu Plains.McCoy A. W. 1980, Drug Traffic, New York: Harper & Row, 289 In 1983 the comfortably incarcerated Riley was declared bankrupt, owing $132,497 to Nugan Hand Bank (in liquidation). He was released in May 1984, having served less than six years of his seventeen-year sentence, when the NSW government introduced new prisoner parole legislation.Chipp D. 1984, QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE MURRAY STEWART RILEY: RELEASE ON PAROLE Senate Hansard, available http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives Soon after his release, Riley began collaborating with gunman Arthur Stanley (Neddy) Smith and pilot Peter David Johnstone to fly about 50 kilograms of heroin from Papua New Guinea for distribution in Australia. = Prison escapes = By the 1990s, Riley had changed his name by deed poll to Murray Lee Stewart. In October 1990, Riley and Jonathan Nicholas Gould were arrested in Britain and charged with conspiring to defraud British Aerospace PLC of ¬£40,000,000 by way of computer fraud. In July 1991, they were both convicted of conspiracy to defraud and were sentenced to five years imprisonment. Again, Riley was not without friends. While Gould remained in a medium-security prison, Riley's risk classification was rapidly revised, allowing him to be accommodated at an open prison farm. In December 1991, Riley simply walked out of Spring Hill Prison, Aylesbury. His escape was not recorded for seven weeks and he remained at large for eight weeks; travelling to Northern Ireland, Spain and Belgium before being recaptured in Essex on 31 January 1992.Morton, J. & S. Lobez 2007, 161. After being returned to prison, he was again rapidly moved to a minimum-security prison in Kent. While police knew that he had been in contact with the IRA while on the run and intended to escape again, no extra security was initiated. On 19 January 1993, Riley escaped again and is believed to have taken part in a multimillion-pound IRA counterfeit racket. He eventually settled incognito in Hong Kong.Lyndon N. & S. Harvey 1993, \\"Riley out of Jail, into Counterfeit\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 4 April 1993. In early 1994, Riley flew from Hong Kong to Australia and settled in Queensland. Upon his fourth application, he was issued with an Australian passport. A spokesman for the British Home Office said unofficially it would be \\"extremely unlikely\\" that Riley would be extradited to the United Kingdom. He said that Riley had been found guilty of the \\"victimless\\" crime of conspiracy and the cost of bringing him back to London under police escort would be \\"exorbitant\\".Mitchell A. 1994, \\"Pimpernel tipped to return home\\", Herald Sun, 9 January 1994.

The liner notes specify \\"text and composition by Resurrector\\", which would lead one to assume that it was indeed written by him. Reviewers and interviewers have referred to the work with various degrees of both interest and disdain. The LA Weekly calls it a \\"bible/babble manifesto\\", the Denver Westword refers to it as \\"a scripturally spirited rant\\" and The Source Weekly labels it as, \\"steeped in allegory and at times reading like ancient scripture\\". It is a 70-page bound book presented in seven sections divided into chapters named after songs from both Survival Guide and Rise, as well as some presumed to be as yet unreleased. The booklet is written about the development of the Warrior consciousness, a trend presented throughout the HDC experience. \\"We use the symbolism of an army and a gathering of soldiers,\\" says Resurrector. \\"There are ways that you can generate, create and prepare for a life focused on trying to elevate consciousness and liberate people ‚Äì and to combat the progression of a society that, we believe, generates closed-minded educational frameworks that don't allow for people to explore their own power and creative tendencies.\\" The chapters of the booklet refer to various aspects of clearing space and redefining perception. Removing mental and spiritual pollution is presented as an essential part of the process (the liberation process) of unifying with the consciousness of the \\"Last Champion.\\" Those who believe and follow this process are referred to as members of the \\"Last Champion's Chosen Army.\\" It stated that people are not chosen to be in this Army, they choose to do so by uniting with the fundamental goals and ideology. They call this global unification of Warriors the \\"Champion Nation\\", which is also the name of their Record Label. Heavyweight Dub Champion performing at Eurockeennes Festival, France 2007 =Sonic Shamanistic Alchemy= The foundation of the band's musical presentation is a method they call \\"Sonic Shamanistic Alchemy\\". The instrumental members of the band are often referred to as \\"Sonic Shamanistic Alchemists\\". As defined by Resurrector, it involves, \\"taking a range of vibrational materials, from tribal instruments to electronic instruments, and manipulating them through devices like tape delays and old analog stomp boxes to try to find the personality of each piece ... looking for particular voices, particular vibrations that would contribute to the spectrum of sound we're trying to bring forth, a spectrum of liberational revolutionary energy ... to change the chemistry of the planet leading to unconditional liberation of the human race.\\" Other projects All the members and affiliates of Heavyweight Dub Champion are active in other music projects. Resurrector rebranded his project Liberation Movement in 2010 and has since been performing in the US, Canada, Peru and Costa Rica. He recorded and produced the album On√°yabaon Bew√° ‚Äì Messages from Mother Earth' by Shamans of the Temple of the Way of Light in 2011.

Style of Play The origin of the name was based upon the distinctive Scottish style of play ‚Äì described at the time as being ‚Äúcombination football‚Äù ‚Äì which was centred upon a passing game with greater teamwork as opposed to the individualistic, dribbling style common in England at the time. It was this distinctive style of football ‚Äì which has been described as \\"changing the nature of soccer\\" ‚Äì which had become the hallmark of the Scottish game of the era. The ability of the Scottish players, their apparently superior technique, and the nature of their play impressed English spectators during the Scotland - England international fixtures which had been taking place since 1872 and led to a great number of Scots players moving south to play professionally for English clubs once this became legal in 1885.  First 'Professors'  The issue of professionalism arose in 1880 when a dispute began between the FA and Bolton Wanderers (founded in 1874), who had offered professional terms to Scottish players. The subject remained a heated one through the 1880s, directly or indirectly involving many other clubs besides Bolton. Their neighbours, Blackburn Rovers (founded in 1875) and Darwen (founded in 1870) had also signed Scottish players professionally. The FA espoused the ideal of so‚Äìcalled \\"amateurism\\" promoted by the likes of Corinthian F.C. from whom the phrase ‚ÄúCorinthian Spirit‚Äù came into being. There were constant arguments about broken‚Äìtime payments, out‚Äìof‚Äìpocket expenses and what amounted to actual wages. Despite its convictions, the FA had no objection to professional clubs playing in the FA Cup and this may have been a tacit acknowledgement that the growth of professionalism was inevitable, as had long been the case in cricket. Blackburn Rovers established the predominance of professionalism by winning the FA Cup in three successive seasons from 1884 to 1886 and the FA formally legitimised professionalism in 1885. Reaction in Scotland This trend of Scottish players moving to England, along with professionalism generally, was bitterly opposed by much of the Scottish footballing establishment and media. The latter saw the Professors described as ‚ÄúTraitorous wretches‚Äù and ‚Äúbase mercenaries‚Äù in the press with the Scottish Football Association blacklisting players known to have played professionally.https://web.archive.org/web/20100424063626/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/committees/enterprise/inquiries/sfi/fie_pt02_O%27Brien.pdf However professionalism was eventually established in Scottish football in 1893 although Scotland‚Äôs most powerful club and founders of both the passing and international game, Queen's Park, initially refused to participate in the new professional league (not joining until 1900) and remained committed to the amateur principles even after entering into competition with professional clubs. They remained an amateur club until 2019, when its membership voted to end that status in November of that year. Immediate Impact John Campbell, a part of the \\"Team of All Talents\\", and league top scorer in Sunderland's first three titles. The impact made upon English football by these Scots players was immediate and wide-ranging. For instance, the famous Corinthians football club of London were founded purely to emulate the Scottish game and to allow the English national team to challenge Scottish dominance which had seen the Scots defeat the English by scores of 7‚Äì2, 6‚Äì1 and 5‚Äì1 between the years 1878‚Äì1882. The first English team to win the Championship and Cup \\"double\\", Preston North End, did so with a majority of their team being made up of Scottish players as did the Sunderland side which won 3 English Championships between 1892 and 1895 while the first Liverpool team to take to the field in 1892 was made up entirely of Scots. Ned Doig, a part of Sunderland's \\"Team of All Talents\\" and 19th-century world record holder by not conceding any goals in 87 of his 290 top division appearances (30%). The wealthy miner Samuel Tyzack, who alongside and shipbuilder Robert Turnbull funded the Sunderland A.F.C. \\"team of all talents,\\" often pretended to be a priest while scouting for players in Scotland, as Sunderland's recruitment policy in Scotland enraged many Scottish fans. In fact, the whole Sunderland lineup in the 1895 World Championship was made from entirely Scottish players.https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/25/even-when- sunderland-ruled-the-globe-club-world-cups-were-controversial https://www.nutmegmagazine.co.uk/issue-5/when-sunderland-met-hearts-in-the- first-ever-champions-league-match/ Sunderland striker, the Scot John Campbell, became league top scorer three times, in all of which Sunderland won the league. Important to his success in attack were other \\"Team of All Talents\\" players from Scotland: Jimmy Hannah and Jimmy Millar. Their goalkeeper Ned Doig set a 19th-century world record by not conceding any goals in 87 of his 290 top division appearances (30%). Preston North End, the first English team to win the Championship and Cup \\"double\\", did so with a majority of their team being made up of Scottish players. In the first season, they went undefeated both in the league and the FA Cup, which led to them being known as \\"the invincibles.\\" https://www.nutmegmagazine.co.uk/issue-4/the-scottish- professors-and-their-role-in-footballs-first-invincibles/ Legacy The ‚ÄúScotch Professors‚Äù were known also for spreading the game ‚Äì both football generally and ‚Äúcombination‚Äù team passing style of play for which they were known ‚Äì internationally with prominent Scots players of the time playing major roles in the introduction of football across the British Empire, Europe, South America (particularly Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil) and to China .http://scotzine.com/blog/?page_id=2004 See also *Queen's Park F.C. *Football in Scotland *Football in England *History of association football *Home Scots v Anglo-Scots *C.

Description Bumbar is an anti-armour (tank) weapon from Serbia. The Bumbar is a wire guided, man-portable, short- ranged missile system for use against ground targets. The missile has a soft launch capability - the main motor firing after the missile has left the launcher, which allows for the missile to be fired from confined spaces, which is a necessity in urban warfare. During its flight, the rocket is maneuvered by unique system of thrust vectoring. The missile is propelled by two main rocket motor exhaust vanes located at mid body. As the missile rotates the launch units send signals commanding the correction by one of the two vanes to move against the missile motors thrust. For example, if the missile has to move to the left, the right thrust vector vane will actuate at the correct time. It is protected against electronic countermeasures through: \\"Use of CCD matrix sensors, fast image processing computer and robust missile tracer recognition algorithm.\\" Its general design is similar to the French/Canadian ERYX MBDA anti-tank missile and has similar specifications. However MBDA has never supplied Serbia or the former Yugoslavia with technical information regarding the Eryx. so the Bumbar missile is probably reverse engineered from Eryx. =General information= * Time of flight to target at 600 m: 4.6 s * Warhead penetration: over 1000 mm RHA behind ERA * Range: up to 600 m * Weapon length in travelling position: 1164 mm * Capable of firing from confined spaces * Night firing capability * Mass of missile in transporting/launching tube: 14 kg * Secondary warhead caliber: 55 mm * LC axis superelevation angle: 10¬∞ See also ERYX References Category:Anti-tank missiles of Serbia Category:Military Technical Institute Belgrade Category:Serbian inventions ","title":"Bumbar"},{"id":"20787801","text":"February 28, 1900: British forces defending Ladysmith are rescued after a four-month siege (painting by John Henry Frederick Bacon) February 1, 1900: Kodak introduces the one dollar Brownie camera The following events occurred in February 1900: February 1, 1900 (Thursday) *The Eastman Kodak Company introduced the Brownie camera, shipping it to dealers on this date.

She specializes in language acquisition and developmental psycholinguistics, focusing on the relationship between language development and language structure, and most recently on the effects of pediatric stroke on the organization and recovery of language. Biography Newport graduated from Ladue Horton Watkins High School in Ladue, Missouri in 1965. Newport attended Wellesley College from 1965 to 1967 and in 1969 graduated from Barnard College of Columbia University. Newport received a Ph.D from the University of Pennsylvania in 1975, where her advisors were Lila Gleitman and Henry Gleitman. She was a member of the faculty in the Department of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego and the University of Illinois before joining the faculty at the University of Rochester, where she was chair of the department and the George Eastman Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. In July 2012, she joined the faculty at Georgetown University where she became the founding director of the newly established Center for Brain Plasticity and Recovery. Dr. Newport is married to Ted Supalla, who is also a professor in the Department of Neurology at Georgetown University. In 2017, Newport and eight other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit with attorney Ann Olivarius against the University of Rochester for sexual misconduct by Professor Florian Jaeger of the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department.Case No: 6:17-cv-06847, Aslin et al. v. University of Rochester et al. The lawsuit followed upon an independent investigation by the university, about which Newman said \\"It is not acceptable to say that people have behaved offensively and inappropriately to our students, but nobody did anything wrong. It is not an acceptable conclusion to arrive at. Shame on you.\\"Colleen Flaherty, \\"No closure at Rochester,\\" Inside HigherEd, 12 January 2018.

Research interests Newport studies both normal acquisition and creolization using miniature languages presented to learners in the lab, where both the input and the structure of the language can be controlled, to see how the learning process actually works. A second line of research concerns maturational effects on language learning, comparing children to adults as first and second language learners, and asking why children, who are more limited in most cognitive domains, perform better than adults in language acquisition. She also conducts studies of human learners acquiring musical and other nonlinguistic patterns, and of nonhuman primates attempting to learn the same materials, to see where sequential learning, and the constraints on such learning, differ across species and domains. A long-term interest concerns understanding why languages universally display certain types of structures, and considers whether constraints on pattern learning in children may provide part of the basis for universal regularities in languages of the world. Her most recent work investigates language and the brain, using MRI to examine how sign and oral languages are represented in the brain and how language is reorganized after damage or disease. =Statistical Learning= With Richard N. Aslin and Jenny Saffran, Newport introduced statistical learning to the study of natural language acquisition: the hypothesis that infants, young children, and adults acquire the structure of languages by computing the statistics of the co-occurrence of elements - which elements of the sound stream occur most frequently, and which elements occur consistently together or predictively - and using these statistics to find the words, phrases, and sentence structures of their languages. They suggested that this process is implicit (therefore related to the more general notion of implicit learning) and can be done rapidly and online during language listening. Newport and Aslin have gone on from their initial study of word segmentation to reveal the statistical computations done by children and adults in forming word categories, verb argument structure and phrase structure and also have shown that this type of computation is not unique to language but appears to be a widespread computational ability that appears in other modalities and domains as well. =Less is More Hypothesis= One of Newport's most well-known contributions to the field of language acquisition research is the Less is More Hypothesis. In this hypothesis, Newport posits that children are better able to learn languages than adults because they have fewer cognitive resources available to them. This is advantageous in learning a complex combinatorial system such as a human language because children, given their cognitive limitations, will naturally proceed by beginning with small parts and will acquire more complex constructions only as they mature. In contrast, more competent adults will begin by trying to analyze more complexity from the start and will have difficulty finding the best analyses. In her natural language studies she has shown that learners who begin in childhood show much greater ultimate proficiency in both first and second languages than those who begin in adulthood. In her miniature language studies she has shown that children and adults differ in language learning in well controlled studies in the lab, with young children acquiring regular patterns and rules even when their input is inconsistent. This regularization process provides an explanation of how children may contribute to the formation of languages over generations. Awards and honors Newport has been recognized by a number of organizations for the impact of her theoretical and empirical contributions to the field of language acquisition. She has been elected as a fellow in the American Philosophical Society, the Association for Psychological Science, the Society of Experimental Psychologists, the Cognitive Science Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Sciences. Her research has been supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation, the James S. McDonnell Foundation, and the Packard Foundation. In 2015, she was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Sciences. She had previously received the Claude Pepper Award of Excellence from the NIH, and the William James Lifetime Achievement Award for Basic Research, the highest honor given by the Association for Psychological Science (APS).

Citizenship of the European Union was established by Article 20 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 elaborates the right of Union citizens and their family members to move and reside freely in the territory of a member state, consolidating previous Directives dealing with the right to move and reside within the European Community (EC). It is a logical consequence of the right to free movement that migrant citizens can move their family from one member state to another. Not to allow this would deter them from moving and thus impede their right to free movement. But it is not immediately clear that migrant citizens should have the right to bring their family into a member state when the family members are entering the European Union (EU) for the first time. The Citizenship Directive 2004/38 imposes no condition that family members can only join on first entry if they are already resident within the European Union. Nevertheless, the Irish legislation implementing the directive required the family member to demonstrate lawful residence within the European Union prior to first entry. Metock clarified that it was not lawful to maintain such a requirement. A consequence was that in some member states, such as Denmark, migrant citizens possessed more rights to family reunification than their own nationals who had not exercised their right to free movement by taking up residence in another member state. A non-EU national is a national of a country not in the European Union. In Metock the Court ruled definitively that national rules making the right of residence of non-EU national spouses of Union citizens resident in a member state but not possessing its nationality under the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 conditional on prior lawful residence in another member state were unlawful. It also ruled against national restrictions on when and where their marriage took place and how the non-EU national entered the host member state. Blaise Baheten Metock, a national of Cameroon, arrived in Ireland on 23 June 2006 and applied for asylum. His application was definitively refused on 28 February 2007. Hanette Eugenie Ngo Ikeng, born a national of Cameroon, acquired United Kingdom nationality. She had resided and worked in Ireland since late 2006. Metock and Ngo Ikeng met in Cameroon in 1994 and had been in a relationship since then. They had two children together, one born in 1998 and the other in 2006. They were married in Ireland on 12 October 2006. On 6 November 2006, Metock applied in Ireland for a residence card as the spouse of a Union citizen working and residing in Ireland. The application was refused by decision of the Minister for Justice on 28 June 2007, on the grounds that Metock did not satisfy the condition of prior lawful residence in another member state. Metock, Ngo Ikeng and their children brought proceedings against that decision. They were joined by three other non-EU national applicants. Ten member states expressed an interest in the case. The Court ruled in favour of the applicants on the grounds in the first place that no provision of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 makes its application dependent upon previous lawful residence, and secondly that European Community (and not individual member states) legislature had the competence to regulate the first entry to the European Union of family members of a Union citizen who has exercised his right to free movement, and incidentally making a brief reference to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights that enshrines the right to respect for private and family life. The decision effectively over-ruled an earlier case Secretary of State for the Home Department v Hacene Akrich (2003) C-109/01 that the Irish government had relied on. The Akrich case involved an individual who had entered the UK without authorisation, and was twice deported from the United Kingdom. The individual came into the country a third time without authorisation and married a British citizen. He was soon thereafter deported to Dublin, where his wife was working, where he remained for six months. Following this, he attempted to return to the United Kingdom where his wife had secured employment. In Akrich, in direct contrast to the later Metock case, the ECJ held that the initial unauthorised entrance could be used by national authorities to prevent someone from claiming European rights of establishment. Facts Metock was a Cameroonian national married to a British national working in Ireland. Metock had sought and been refused asylum in Ireland. He and his wife had formed a family in Cameroon prior to Metock's arrival in Ireland and they had two children, one born before Metock's arrival in Ireland and the other born the same year as his arrival. Ikogho, a non-EU national, arrived in Ireland in 2004, applied for and was refused asylum, and then married a British citizen working in Ireland since 1996. Chinedu, a Nigerian national, arrived in Ireland in 2005, applied for and was refused asylum, but before the refusal married a German national working in Ireland. Igboanusi, a Nigerian national, applied for asylum in Ireland, which was refused in 2005. He married a Polish national working in Ireland in 2006, and was deported to Nigeria in December 2007. All four men had their applications for residence cards refused on the grounds that either they did not satisfy a condition of prior lawful residence or in the case of Ikogho that they were staying illegally in Ireland at the time of their marriage. All but Metock had met their spouse after arriving in Ireland and all four were married in Ireland. Together with their spouses (and in the case of Metock their children) they brought proceedings against the decision. The High Court of Ireland made a request for a preliminary ruling to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The High Court affirmed that none of the marriages were marriages of convenience. In essence the High Court asked: # Does Directive 2004/38 (\\"the Citizenship Directive\\") permit a member state to maintain a prior lawful residence requirement, as did Irish legislation? # Does Article 3(1) of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 include within its scope of application a non-EU national who is a spouse of a Union citizen who resides in the host member state, and then resides in the host member state with the Union citizen as his/her spouse irrespective of when or where their marriage took place or how the non-EU national entered the host member state? # If the answer to 2 was negative, whether Article 3(1) includes non-EU nationals who entered the host member state independently of their spouse and subsequently married them there. The case was granted a rare accelerated hearing given the exceptional urgency of the circumstances with regard to both the pressure on the Irish Minister of Justice and the human rights of the applicants in regard to the right to respect for private and family life as enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The case was thus determined after hearing the Advocate General M. Poiares Maduro but without an Opinion being submitted. Ten member states besides Ireland were heard. These were Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and the United Kingdom. In addition the Commission of the European Communities was heard. Judgment The judgment established several important points: * The right of family members to join European Union citizens is regulated only by the Citizenship Directive 2004/38. A member state may not impose any additional regulations such as previous lawful residence in a member state. * It does not matter that the family member met and married their partner after entering the European Union. * It does not matter if the family member had entered the European Union illegally or was living there illegally at the time of their marriage. * Breaches of immigration policy not involving the fundamental interests of society or abuse of rights and fraud, such as marriages of convenience, may be penalised only proportionally, such as by imposing a fine, and not in a way that interferes with the family member's right to freedom of movement and residence, and this applies from the moment the family member derives his rights. The judgment settled that the European Community (EC) and not individual member states were competent to regulate the right of entry into the European Union of non-EU family members of Union citizens who have exercised their right of free movement. Previously case-law had been unclear. Regarding the issue of reverse discrimination arising from migrant citizens receiving more rights to family reunification than host member state nationals who have not exercised their right to free movement by taking up residence in another member state, the Court reiterated that settled case-law had established the so-called \\"wholly internal rule\\" and that the alleged discrimination thus fell outside the scope of European Community law. The first question On the first question regarding the condition of prior lawful residence in another member state, the Court noted in the first place that no provision of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 makes its application conditional on prior residence in a member state. Indeed, some of its provisions suggest that it is applicable to family members not already lawfully resident in another member state. Thus Article 5(2) allows entry without a residence card while Article 10(2) is an exhaustive list of documents that may need presenting, which nevertheless does not include any documents demonstrating prior lawful residence in another member state. Accordingly, the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted as granting rights of entry and residence to non-EU national family members of EU citizens not possessing the nationality of their host member state without distinguishing whether there had been prior lawful residence in another member state. This interpretation was supported by the Court's earlier case-law adopted before the Citizenship Directive 2004/38. It was true that the Court had held in Akrich [50‚Äì51] that prior lawful residence in another member state was a requirement but that conclusion must be reconsidered as it was incompatible with MRAX [59] and Commission v Spain 2005 [28]. In the second place this interpretation was consistent with the division of competences between member states and the European Community. Community legislature was competent to enact the necessary measures to bring about freedom of movement for Union citizens. Union citizens would be discouraged from exercising their right of free movement if they could not be accompanied or joined by their family, and consequently the Community was competent to rule on the issue. The Court rejected the argument put forward by the Irish government and several member states that member states retained exclusive competence to regulate first entry. This would lead to variation of treatment across the Community incompatible with the objective of an internal market set out in Article 3(1)(c) of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Moreover, it would lead to the paradoxical outcome that non-EU nationals who are long-term residents would be able to bring in their family members not lawfully resident in a member state under the Family Reunification Directive 2003/86 whereas a Union citizen in a member state whose nationality he does not possess might not. Consequently, the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 confers rights of entry and residence to non-EU national family members of EU citizens not possessing the nationality of their host member state regardless of whether there had been prior lawful residence in another member state. Regarding the submission by the Irish government and several member states that this interpretation of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 would undermine the ability of member states to control immigration and lead to a great increase in the number of persons able to benefit from rights of residence, the Court replied that it only applied to non-EU national family members of Union citizens who had exercised their right of free movement. Moreover, member states may still refuse entry and residence in accord with Articles 27 and 35 of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38, dealing respectively with personal breaches of public policy, public health or public security and abuse of rights or fraud, such as marriages of convenience. The same governments had also submitted that this interpretation of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 would lead to unjustified reverse discrimination, in so far as nationals of the host member states who had never exercised their right of freedom of movement would not derive the same rights. The Court replied that it was already established case-law that the alleged discrimination fell outside the scope of European Community law, citing Flemish Insurance [33]. Moreover, member states are parties to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights enshrining the right to respect for private and family life. Finally regarding the first question, the Court ruled that it was not lawful to maintain a condition of prior lawful residence in another member state. The second question On the second question regarding the scope of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38, the Court noted in the first place that the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 aims to facilitate the exercise of the right of Union citizens to move and reside freely within the territory of member states and in particular recital 5 of its preamble provides that right, if it is to be exercised under objective conditions of dignity, should also be extended to family members irrespective of their nationality. The provisions of the directive must not be interpreted restrictively, as affirmed in Eind [43]. The directive provides family members of Union citizens the right of entry and residence without any provision requiring the Union citizen already to have founded the family when he moved to his host member state. Not to allow this right would discourage him from continuing to reside there and encourage him to leave to be able to lead a family life in another member state or in a non-member country. The Court ruled therefore that the right applied regardless of whether the Union citizen had founded his family before or after establishing himself in the host member state. On the issue of whether a family member who has entered the host member state before becoming a family member of a Union citizen can be said to accompany or join him, the Court noted that refusing the right of entry or residence in that circumstance would be equally likely to discourage the Union citizen from remaining. To insist on a literal interpretation of 'join' or 'accompany' would be restrictive and equivalent to limiting the rights of entry and residence of the family member. On the issue of the circumstances of the family member's entry, the Court observed that from the moment the family member derives their right of residence, a member state may only restrict that right in compliance with Articles 27 and 35 of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38, dealing respectively with personal breaches of public policy, public health or public security and abuse of rights or fraud, such as marriages of convenience. Member states are entitled to impose penalties, such as a fine, for other breaches so long as they are proportionate and do not interfere with freedom of movement and residence, as affirmed in MRAX [77]. On the question of where the marriage took place, the Court observed that the directive contains no requirement. Finally regarding the second question, the Court ruled that all the circumstances fell within the scope of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38. The third question There was no need to answer the third question as the second question had been answered in the affirmative. Significance The effect of Metock is much enhanced by EindEind and Singh,Singh which confirmed that returning migrants continue to enjoy the family reunification rights they enjoyed while residing in another member state. This has led to the so-called whereby a national of a member state circumvents national restrictions on family reunification by taking up residence in another member state, thus exercising his right of free movement and subsequently relying on his right to family reunification under the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 on his return. A number of member states have claimed this amounts to an abuse of free movement, but in AkrichAkrich the Court ruled that taking up residence in another member state expressly to gain community rights is not an abuse. The case has unintentionally created a vastly foreseeable and predicted consequences in member states' ability to control their borders. The case has undeniably aided the efforts of non-EU nationals seeking to circumvent ordinary immigration procedures by marrying EU nationals, with the Irish authorities stating that around half of the marriages in Ireland in a 2¬Ω years, 2015 to 2017, were bogus, motivated not by love, but by immigration status.https://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0925/108487-marriage/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime- and-law/how-irish-sham-marriage-scam-was-dismantled-1.2949970 The Irish Police cited that 400 sham marriages had been found to have occurred since 2015.http://www.thejournal.ie/sham-marriages-ireland-3724543-Nov2017/ All member states have implemented Metock. Ireland reacted swiftly, implementing the judgment just four working days after receiving it and undertaking to apply it retrospectively. Austria, Cyprus, Czech republic and Slovakia, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, Italy, Lithuania and the United Kingdom are amongst other member states that amended their legislation or policy as a result of Metock. Regarding the issue of reverse discrimination, Austria has explicitly legislated that their nationals must have exercised their right of free movement to gain European Union family reunification rights. Italy, however, decided to avoid reverse discrimination by granting their nationals the same rights of family reunification as their non-national Union citizens. Attention has switched in a number of member states to preventing abuse of European Union rules on residence rights. These include Denmark, France, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden. Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands have called for amendments to be made to the Citizenship Directive 2004/38. The Netherlands has announced its intention to open negotiations at the European level to put an end to abuses of the so-called \\"Europe route\\" where a national migrates to another member state for a period of time so as to exercise his right of free movement and thus gain European Union rights of family reunification on his return, circumventing national restrictions. A small but growing number of member state nationals, especially from Denmark and the Netherlands, indulge in such migration to the concern of their national authorities. On 5 October 2012, the Council of State of the Netherlands requested a preliminary ruling from the Court on four questions relating to the \\"Europe route\\". =Denmark= Denmark's Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) opt-out provided Denmark with the freedom to pursue its own relatively strict policies regarding asylum and family reunification, in particular its implementation of the controversial 24-year rule designed to discourage forced marriages that has nevertheless attracted criticism on human rights grounds. However Metock depends on the Citizenship Directive 2004/38, which is not part of EU co-operation on Justice and Home Affairs, and Denmark is thus obliged to implement Metock. =Netherlands= On 5 October 2012, the Council of State of the Netherlands referred four questions for a preliminary ruling from the Court related to the so-called \\"Europe route\\". In essence these were: # Should the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 apply analogously as in Eind and Singh when a national of a member state returns after receiving services in another member state in the sense of Article 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union? #If so, is a minimum period of residence required in the other member state? #If so, does this still apply when the residence was intermittent, for example at weekends? #In these circumstances, does a delay between the national's return to his member state and the entry of a non-EU national who is a family member into the member state potentially mean that the family member's rights have expired?

He was born in Celle or Wietzendorf. Beginning in 1693, he served as an organist at St. Andreas in Hildesheim. In 1697, he assumed the organist's post at the Stadtkirche in Celle. In 1720, he was appointed court organist at Hanover. Works, editions and recordings Only a few works by him have survived: two small oratorios - for Christmas and Easter, one single-movement keyboard sonata in A major (regarded as the earliest German documentation of the form of the two-part sonata structure, comparable to the formal type encountered in Domenico Scarlatti), and a praeludium in E minor for organ. A \\"Pr√§ludium & Fuge\\" in g minor - which was found not far ago in Berlin and was at first believed to be composed by Nikolaus Bruhns - is now believed to be composed by Brunckhorst. However, due to at least one stylistic inconsistency in the fugue, it seems to be rather probable that - irrespective of the initial authorship of Brunckhorst or Bruhns - this handwriting does not derive from the composer's own hand but some other, probably a scholar. A proposal for correction and supplements is available from me, Klaus Kleinhoff, Rodenberg, Germany. *Brunckhorst Opera omnia complete works: Weihnachts-Historie, Prelude for Organ in E minor.

The organization is officially dedicated to \\"Brotherhood, Service, & Spirit\\" and its members have been recognized by USC as the \\"Official Hosts of the University\\" and \\"Guardians of Tradition.\\"Trojan Knights official website, \\"History\\" The group has been a part of many university traditions and remains active in on- and off-campus events and causes. While not a traditional Greek fraternity, the Trojan Knights have many characteristics similar to fraternities, including their emphasis on brotherhood. The Trojan Knights currently involve themselves in several service events including the USC founded \\"Swim with Mike,\\" benefiting a scholarship for disabled persons aspiring to attend college, and the annual \\"Trojan Knights Carnival,\\" a carnival held on Los Angeles's Skid Row benefiting the children of those families. History The Knights were founded in 1921 by USC students Harry Pryor, Harry Kennedy, and Lindley Bothwell. Bothwell is also credited with numerous other contributions to USC's spirit activities including coaching both USCs Song Girls and the now-defunct USC Yell Leaders and, along with fellow founder Harry Pryor, the introduction of organized card stunts at football games in 1922.\\"Harry M. Pryor Obituary.\\" Trojan Family Magazine. Summer 2003.\\"Lindley Bothwell and the USC Song Girls.\\" Edmonston, George P. \\"Card Stunt King Lindley Bothwell.\\" OSU Alumni Association. In the early years, the organization's recruiting process was systematically tied to that of the university's Greek fraternities, and the majority of new members were also members of a Greek-letter fraternity. Emblematic of these early ties is the fact that Lindley Bothwell is also credited with helping to found the USC chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity five years later in 1926, though the national organization ultimately revoked the chapter's charter in 2014 after allegations of both sexual assault and hazing. Notable events After the USC-UCLA rivalry game in 1941, six Trojan Knights (also members of the Sig Ep fraternity) discreetly plotted and carried out what is now politely referred to as the 'appropriation' of the Victory Bell from the UCLA sidelines. After a year-long prank war between the schools and threats by the administration to cancel that year's game, the bell was returned and subsequently made the official rivalry trophy of the annual game by contract between the student body presidents of the two universities. In 1946, a Knight rescued a dog from a Santa Monica beach. A year later, after becoming a common sight around campus, the dog (named George Tirebiter) would become USC's unofficial mascot. Knights would continue to care for the dog who was later killed in a car crash. A statue honoring the dog's memory currently stands at the south end of Trousdale Parkway on the USC campus.\\"A Trojan tail\\" Daily Trojan Article The Knights are also linked to the origins of Traveler, the white horse that currently serves as USC's official mascot. Although the first official 'Traveler' did not appear until 1961, a Trojan Knight named Arthur J. Gontier III rode a white horse at a USC football game in 1954. This, along with an earlier appearance by a horse in 1948, set a precedent for what has become a long USC tradition of equine mascots.\\"Trojan Spirit.\\" University of Southern California. p 199. The Knights later received national media attention after the \\"Westwood Sucks\\" card stunt incident. During the 1971 ABC broadcast of the USC-UCLA rivalry game, only the middle part of a Knights- organized card stunt meant to read \\"Why do people go to UCLA? Westwood sucks...them in\\" made the air.\\"\\"Westwood Sucks!\\", Trojan Wire. Throughout this time, Knights were also involved in arranging and hosting university events not related to athletics. In his memoir, Awakening Waves, Alumnus Richard LeVine recalls using his position as a Trojan Knight in 1960 to arrange campus speaking engagements with then-presidential candidates Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.https://books.google.com/books?id=SiDz4Puhff8C&pg;=PA32&dq;=%22Trojan+Knights%22+usc&as;_brr=3 Trojan Knights in the 2000s The Knights have gained national visibility as a result of their activities during each fall's football season. Knights have been featured on ESPN's College GameDay body-painting with the school colors and letters spelling out messages. More recently, they gained national attention when caught on camera while Anav Saxena (painted with the letter \\"G\\") was using the bathroom, leaving just the letters \\"Fiht On!\\" Saxena swiftly hurried back, but not before the incident had made it onto ESPN and a number of other news sources.ESPN Gameday: USC-OSURose, Adam. \\"How to Break the BCS.\\" LA Times Blog: All Things Trojan. 24 Nov 2008. The Knights are also involved in various \\"rivalry week\\" activities surrounding the annual game against UCLA. The Knights stand guard night and day at the base of USC's Tommy Trojan Statue, a common target of past UCLA pranks, for the week prior to the game and organize an annual bonfire at which a representation of the UCLA Bruin mascot is burned.\\"Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan Statue.\\" ESPN the Mag online. In recent years, the Knights have taken to wrapping Tommy Trojan in cellophane, and to building a doghouse around the George Tirebiter statue. The Knights also guard the Victory Bell on game days, and ring it after touchdowns during the first three quarters of all home games when it is in USC possession. Beyond their work as a spirit organization, the Knights participate at many on- and off-campus events and causes at USC. The Knights work alongside their sister organization, the USC Helenes, as well as other USC student organizations, fraternities, sororities and athletic teams at USC's annual \\"Swim With Mike\\" philanthropy event. According to the group's website, they also host other social and philanthropic events including an annual Fall philanthropy fundraiser known as \\"Tirebiter Run\\" that raises funds for the \\"Keep Kids Safe\\" campaign of \\"A Better LA\\".

The play depicts the sexual vanity of a rich, ageing beauty, her troubled relationship with her adult son, and drug abuse in British society circles after the First World War. The son's cocaine habit is seen by many critics as a metaphor for homosexuality, then taboo in Britain. Despite, or because of, its controversial content for the time, the play was Coward's first great commercial success. The play premiered in November 1924 in London and played in three theatres until June 1925, followed by a British tour and a New York production in 1925‚Äì26. It has enjoyed several revivals and a film adaptation. Background Kate Cutler (c. 1900) In the years after the First World War, pairings in England of older, upper class women and younger men were common.Hoare, p. 128 The idea for the play was put in Coward's mind by an incident at a nightclub.Hoare, p. 82 Grace Forster, the elegant mother of his friend Stewart Forster, was talking to a young admirer, when a young woman said, in earshot of Coward and Forster, \\"Will you look at that old hag over there with the young man in tow; she's old enough to be his mother\\". Forster paid no attention, and Coward immediately went across and embraced Grace, as a silent rebuke to the young woman who had made the remark. The episode led him to consider how a \\"mother‚Äìyoung son‚Äìyoung lover triangle\\" might be the basis of a play.Lesley, p. 80 To add to the dramatic effect of his play, Coward included a further source of conflict between the mother, Florence, and son, Nicky. Coward's friend and biographer Cole Lesley records, \\"this came easily to him from his unlikely pre-occupation ‚Ä¶ with the subject of drug addiction\\". To Nicky's explicit cocaine habit, the author added what many critics have seen as a gay sub-text.Hoare, p. 129 Coward's biographer Philip Hoare sees clues to Nicky's unconventional sexuality in his intimate friendship with John Bagot (an offstage character), and his implausible engagement to a brisk young woman, Bunty Mainwaring; Hoare describes her as \\"a 'beard', a guise of heterosexuality\\". When asked if she is pretty, Nicky answers, \\"I don't know ‚Äì I haven't really noticed.\\"Coward (1989), p. 92 Florence's lover Tom finds Nicky \\"effeminate\\".Coward (1989), p. 98 The literary critic John Lahr writes that Coward pushed at the prevailing moral boundaries of the day: \\"His straight-talking about homosexuality ‚Äì the issue disguised as drug-taking in The Vortex and the code behind the frivolity in his great comedies ‚Äì was as far as he could go.\\"Lahr, p. 154 Until 1968 the English theatre was subject to official censorship; plays had to be licensed by the Lord Chamberlain's Office.Lewis, Anthony. \\"Londoners Cool to Hair's Nudity: Four Letter Words Shock Few at Musical's Debut\\", The New York Times, 29 September 1968 The Vortex barely survived the censor's scrutiny, but Coward pleaded his case in person to the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Cromer. He persuaded Cromer that the play was \\"a moral tract\\", and despite reservations expressed to the Chamberlain by King George V and others, Cromer granted a licence.Hoare, p. 135 Leading London managements considered staging the piece, but some shied away from the controversial content, and others did not want Coward to play the lead.Castle, p. 61 As one of Coward's principal objects in writing the play had been \\"to write a good play with a whacking great part in it for myself\\",Castle, p. 65 he abandoned attempts to convince West End managements, and arranged to stage the play at the Everyman Theatre, Hampstead, a fringe venue in north London.Morley, pp. 89‚Äì90 When the money for the production threatened to run out during rehearsals, Coward secured the necessary funding from his friend the author Michael Arlen.Castle, pp. 61‚Äì62 As well as co-starring, Coward directed the play.Castle, p. 60 and Coward (2004), pp. 167 and 174 Upset by a last-minute revision that increased Coward's role and, she believed, diminished the importance of hers, the female star, Kate Cutler, dropped out less than two weeks before the premiere.Coward (2004), p. 175 Coward was able to engage the veteran actress Lilian Braithwaite, who accepted the part for the small salary offered and learned it at very short notice.Coward (2004), pp. 176‚Äì178 Original production The Vortex opened at the Everyman on 25 November 1924, with the following cast: *Preston ‚Äì Claire Keep *Helen Saville ‚Äì Mary Robson *Pauncefort Quentin ‚Äì F.

Nicky is engaged to Bunty Mainwaring, a journalist; his mother Florence, an ageing socialite beauty, has extramarital affairs with younger men in an attempt to recapture her youth. She does not disguise these, creating society gossip. Her friend Helen advises her to accept ageing more gracefully. Florence's new young man, Tom, turns out to be Bunty's ex-fianc√©, which makes Nicky jealous. Florence plans a weekend social gathering at the family's country house. ;Act II On Sunday evening the house party is in full swing, with Nicky playing the piano. Florence feels insecure about Tom, and she and Nicky quarrel. Helen discovers Nicky's drug habit and pleads with him to give it up. Nicky struggles with the simmering resentment he feels for his vainglorious and promiscuous mother, his own weakness for cocaine, and, in the view of some commentators, his repressed homosexuality.Sinfield, pp. 37‚Äì38 Bunty breaks off her engagement with Nicky and seeks Tom's comfort. Florence catches them kissing. ;Act III The next morning Helen asks Florence to think of her son, but Florence is more concerned with blaming Tom and Bunty. Nicky arrives as Helen leaves and he and Florence quarrel more. He reveals his drug habit to her and begs her to give up her selfish ways and to behave like a mother. In the end, the two each agree to try to change, as Florence strokes Nicky's hair.Wycoff, Taylor M. \\"About the Play ‚Äì The Vortex\\", Teacher Study Guide, Cygnet Theatre, San Diego, accessed 20 October 2015 Revivals and adaptations A 1952 revival played at the Theatre Royal, Brighton and the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, with Dirk Bogarde as Nicky and Isabel Jeans as Florence.

Personal life  Gleitman obtained both his bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology: the bachelor's degree from the City College of New York, and his master's from the University of California. Henry Gleitman was wed to another psychologist named Lila R. Gleitman. Together, they penned a book together called Phrase and Paraphrase. The book was released in 1970. He fathered two daughters. Their names are Ellen Luchette and Claire Gleitman. Gleitman was born in Leipzig, Germany. He received his PhD in psychology from the University of California, Berkeley. He then taught at Swarthmore College before joining the Penn faculty in 1953. Gleitman was a cognitive psychologist with interests in language (especially the relationship between semantics and syntax), but he claimed, \\"I'm probably better identified as a general psychologist whose research interests range over many of the traditional areas of psychological inquiry.\\" Gleitman was willing to work with students in any field of psychology if that student can interest him in his/her proposed field of research. Gleitman is best known for his authorship of Psychology, a classic textbook first published in 1981 used in many Introduction to Psychology classes, now in its eighth edition.Henry Gleitman, James Gross, Daniel Reisberg (2010), Psychology, Gleitman was married to fellow psychologist Lila R. Gleitman, an internationally renowned language acquisition researcher, who is also a Professor Emerita of Psychology and Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.  Major Accomplishments  In his field, Gleitman had been awarded by the American Psychological Foundation for the distinguished teaching in psychology award in 1982. He was also awarded the Abrams Award in 1988 as well as the Lindback Award in 1977. He is a very well rounded individual with many accomplishments, such as serving as president of the APA‚ÄôS Division 1 (General Psychology) and Division 10 ( Psychology and the Arts). Within his five decades of teaching and educating other he has taught introductory psychology to over 40,000 students. Gleitman had an array of interest and accomplishments, such as being a known polymath, he was also involved in the arts of theatre in which he both acted and directed while at Berkeley, Philadelphia, and New York City. Besides his interest in psychology, theatrics was a major part of life and he worked with actors of all ages ranging from children all the way up to seasoned professionals. Gleitman would refer to himself as a bigamist because when it came to psychology and theatre, he dichotomized the thought of having to choose, but always found a way to entertain both.

He began dancing with the Geneva Ballet in Switzerland, continuing with the Stuttgart Ballet and later the Munich Ballet both under the direction of John Cranko becoming a principal dancer. Francois joined The Hamburg Ballet under the direction of John Neumeier. Francois choreographed on several occasions for members of the Hamburg Ballet and for the Semper Oper Ballet, Dresden. He then accepted an offer from the Bern Theatre in Switzerland to become Artistic Director in 1991. In 1997, Francois was appointed Artistic Director of Queensland Ballet. Francois Klaus remained as Artistic Director and Chief Choreographer at Queensland Ballet until the end of 2012. He choreographed most of the Company's works - combining his extensive ballet and musical knowledge. Klaus introduced Queensland audiences to other Australian and international choreographers, as well as reworking well-known classics. One popular programme, introduced by Klaus, was the studio series \\"vis-a-vis\\", in which he presented excerpts from up-coming ballets, which illustrated aspects of ballet that Klaus demonstrated to his audience. Klaus collaborated with musicians, actors, and teachers of other forms of dance. Along with his wife, Robyn White, Artistic Associate of Queensland Ballet, Francois Klaus established Queensland Ballet's \\"Professional Year\\" programme, which prepared gifted young dancers (after audition) for life as professional ballet dancers. Klaus showed audiences, not only throughout Queensland, but also in Germany, Switzerland, Japan and Singapore, that he could put his creative mind to classical, contemporary, comic, and children's ballet. At the end of 2008, Klaus staged an ambitious re-working of Swan Lake, into which he'd woven a Russian love story, bringing together over 50 dancers, the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, Queensland-made sets and costumes. In 2011, Queensland Ballet Chair, Joan Sheldon, announced that Francois Klaus had resigned his post, but would stay on until the end of 2013. However, he left at the end of 2012. Francois Klaus was replaced by Li Cunxin in 2012 as Artistic Director, as Li does not choreograph.

The Minoan Frescoes Fresco painting was one of the most important forms of Minoan art. Unfortunately, many of the surviving examples are fragmentary. The walls of the great halls of the palaces and houses of Crete were skilfully decorated with frescoes. The paint was applied swiftly while the wall plaster was still wet, so that the colours would be completely absorbed and would not fade. The Minoans followed the Egyptian convention regarding colours (e.g. red for men's flesh, white for women's flesh, yellow for gold, blue for silver, and red for bronze). Through the frescoes, one can gain the sense of the character of Minoan life and art and the Minoan joie de vivre.J.A. Sakellarakis. Herakleion Museum. Illustrated guide to the Museum Ekdotike Athinon, Athens 1987, p. 118 Some frescoes were reconstructed between 1450 and 1400 BC, when the Myceneans had established themselves on the island, and exhibit a completely different style of art.Furumark Location A copy of the painting is placed at the Procession Fresco, a long passageway known as the Corridor of the Procession at the palace of Knossos, while the original is on display at the Heraklion Archaeological Museum. It shows a young man strolling in a garden. He wears a short apron, which was incorrectly added by archaeologist Arthur Evans,F. Schachermeyer. Die Minoische Kultur des alten Kreta a necklace of lilies, a crown of lilies and peacock feathers. He is thought to represent the Priest King of Knossos. Possibly he has a griffin or a sphinx on a leash in his left hand. His skin is painted white, which was normally reserved for depicting women. Reconstitution The reconstitution of the so-called \\"Priest-king\\" from Knossos is one of the more popular figures of Minoan art. It is made with three ancient fragments of painted plaster (the crown, the torso, the left leg); the other parts are modern, hypothetic painting. When Arthur Evans uncovered the plaster fragments in 1901, he wrote that they belonged to different personages and \\"the torso may suggest a boxer\\".Arthur Evans published his findings in the Annual of the British School at Athens BSA 7 (1900-1901) p. 15‚Äì16. > Anatomical observation of this torso shows a contracted powerful musculature > and the left disappeared arm was surely in ascendant position because the > pectoral muscle is raised.

Their numbers have gradually diminished and there is now no Armenians in the country. There was a fairly large Armenian colony in Dhaka, cencentrated in the neighbourhood of Armanitola, during the early part of the 18th century. The Armenian community played a significant role in Bengali trade and commerce in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Armenian Apostolic Church of the Holy Resurrection established by the community in 1781, along with the adjacent cemetery, is a major landmark and tourist attraction of old Dhaka.HAYK, The Ubiquitous Armenian: Dhaka, Bangladesh Armeniapedia: Armenian Churches in Asia Their assertive presence, however, began to decline from the beginning of British rule. Michael Joseph Martin (Mikel Housep Martirossian), reported to be the last Armenian in Dhaka, died on 9th of May 2020. History There is no exact record of when the Armenians first came to Dhaka. Some historians suggest that they came in Bengal in the early 17th century as a part of the migration of Armenians from Persia. After Safavid rulers conquered Eastern Armenia in the Caucasus, Shah Abbas deported about 40,000 Armenian traders specialized in inter-Euroasiatic trade to Isfahan and New Julfa. Armenian traders first came to Bengal from Isfahan and New Julfa in the wake of Persian adventurers, eventually establishing their own trading community. They were recognized as a distinct trading community by the Mughal government since late 17th century. It is not known when they came to Dhaka, then one of the commercial centres in Bengal. On the evidence of dates on tombstones the time is assumed to be early 18th century. As Persian was the official language of the Mughal court, the Persian-speaking Armenians could easily settle themselves down in the Mughal Empire. The Nawabs of Dhaka are known to have engaged them to transact their personal businesses openly or clandestinely as well as the European maritime companies, who used them as local representatives and their vakils (spokesperson or pleaders) to the royal courts. Khwaja Hafizullah, a merchant prince, laid the foundations for the Dhaka Nawab Family by accumulating wealth by doing business with Greek and Armenian merchants. This trend was followed by his nephew and the first Nawab of the family Khwaja Alimullah.M Ali Akbar, Dhaka Nawab Estate, Banglapedia, Asiatic Society of Bangladesh Initially they lived in the neighborhoods of Moulvibazar and Nolgola, before moving to Armanitola. Between 1833‚Äì1918, at the height of Armenian presence, the records of Armanian Church in Dhaka list over 200 deaths, as well as over 250 baptisms and over 50 marriages.Syed Maqsud Jamil, Armenians of Dacca, The Daily Star, March 08, 2015 Apart from Dhaka there was a significant Armenian presence in Saidabad (a suburb of the capital Murshidabad), Hoogli, Kolkata, Chinsura, Patna and Kasimbazar. Living and lifestyle The Armenian community of Dhaka were initially engaged in export trade paying a duty of 3.5% to the government. Dhaka was the hub of fine textiles at that time, a fact that attracted Persians and Armenians to settle business there. In an estimate of the textile export from Dhaka (which was a major textile production center in Bengal), the Armenian share was said to have been 27% in 1747. In the silk market, there are indications that the Armenians were dominant buyers, along with Gujaratis and merchants from Delhi, Agra and Benares. They were also prominent in the jute trade. Most of Armenians were engaged in the jute trade. Prominent Armenian jute merchants had their own companies, like Messrs Sarkies & Sons, Messrs David & Co. and others. But gradually the jute business was monopolised by the more powerful and better-organised British firms.Mesrovb Jacob Seth, Armenians in India, from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, page 575, Asian Educational Services, 1983, Besides these, they also did businesses of saltpeter, salt, and betel nut. The Armenian community in Armanitola was small but rich. Some wealthy Armenians used to reside in European-style bungalows. was one such bungalow that was quite popular. Parts of the gardens of Shahbag, Ruplal House (another major landmark in old Dhaka) and the land where Bangabhaban (the presidential residence) stands belonged to Armenian zamindars (landlords). There is still a Manuk House inside Bangabhaban, bearing the name of the original owner's family. Armenians introduced Ticca-Garry (horse- carriage) in Dhaka and it became a popular transport of Dhaka. They also set up western-style department stores in Dhaka. The stores mostly sold European and British goods. They also played a major role as patrons of education and urban development in Dhaka. The Pogose School, the first private school in the country, was founded by Nicholas Pogose, a merchant and a zamindar. P Arathon was the headmaster of the Normal School. According to the Dhaka Prakash, a newspaper of his time, students in his school scored better in examinations than students of other normal schools in Bengal, including the one in Hoogli. Armenian church Prior to building the church at Armanitola (popularly known as the Armani Church) they worshiped at a small chapel in the same area, while deceased members of the community were interred at the Roman Catholic Church at Tejgaon, which was five miles from Dhaka at the time. Some of the Armenian tombstones there date back to 1714 to 1794. The oldest tombstone is ‚ÄúAvetis‚Äù, an Armenian merchant who died on 15 August 1714. After moving to Armanitola, Armenian settlers built a small chapel in the midst of their community graveyard. By the end of the 18th century, the Armenian community had grown considerably, and the chapel was found inadequate for the needs of the community. It was then replaced by the Holy Resurrection Church, completed in 1781 and consecrated by Bishop Ephreim. A belfry on the west of the church was added in 1837. The tower fell down in the earthquake of 1897. A parsonage was added and the floor of the church was decorated with marble, and electric lights in 1910. Notable Armenians of Bengal House of Nicholas Pogose before demolition Armenian influence in the commercial life of Dhaka was led by the Pogoses, Agacy, Michael, Stephen, Joakim, Sarkies, Arathon (also spelled as Aratun), Coja (also spelled Khojah) and Manook (also spelled as Manuk) families. By 1868, five of the six European zamindars in Dhaka were Armenians - JG Nicholas Pogose, GC Paneati, J Stephan, JT Lucas and W Harney. Alongside members of the major merchant families, Margar David, Mackertich Abraham George, Michael Sarkies, Abraham Lucas, M Highcazony, A S Mackertich, Tigran Nahapiet, Thaddeus Nahapiet, M.J. Catchhatoor, Joseph Lazarus, and M David were other prominent Armenians of Dhaka. Dhaka was not the only center of Armenian influence in the region, and there were Armenians who rose to prominence for all of Bengal. There is an Armanitola in Kolkata, and an Armanighat as well. *Khojah Phanoos Kalandar: The earliest noted Armenian who entered into an agreement with the East India Company for using English ships for trade by himself and other members of his community in 1688. *Khojah Israel Sarhand: A nephew of Khojah Phanoos, he helped the English to secure the Company's Kolkata zamindari from Subadar Azim ush Shan in 1698, and was a vakil (spokesperson) of the Company's Surman Embassy to the Mughal Emperor Farrukh Siyar. He was instrumental in realizing the grand imperial farman (decree) of 1717 granting extraordinary privileges to the Company. *Khojah Petrus Nicholas: He was court advisor and financier to Nawab Alivardi Khan, and a leader of the Armenian community. *Khojah Wajid: The most notable Armenian in Bengal.A monopolist in the highly profitable saltpetre trade (one of the most important commodities in the export list of the European companies) since 1753, this Armenian merchant conducted most of the negotiations between the Company and Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah. Conducting his trading from Hugli, he dominated the commercial scene of Bangal as one of the merchant princes along with Mahtab Chand and Sawaroop Chand known as the two Jagat Sayts (bankers of the world), as well as Omichand. Son of Khojah Mahmet Fazel, an influential Armenian merchant in the mid 18th century, he obtained footholds in the durbar of the Nawab as a vakil for his community in 1740s and eventually rose to be a member of the Nawab's inner-circle. :He had extensive business transactions with the French, the Dutch and the English. At one point, Jean Law de Lauriston, the chief of the French factory at Kasim Bazar pointed out that Wajid wanted to be on good terms with everybody. He owned at least six ships - Salamat Ressan, Salamat Manzil, Mobarak, Gensamer, Medina Baksh and Mubarak Manzil - traveling from Hoogli to Jeddah, Mocha, Basra, Surat and Masulipatnam. :After the Battle of Plassey, he obtained a parwana (decree) from Mir Jafar, the new Nawab, \\"for the entire possession of the saltpetre trade at Patna\\", which he promised to use in assistance to the Company in procuring salt at the cheapest rate, provided they \\"assisted him in return to make the Dutch purchase from him\\". The Company took over his saltpetre empire in 1758, which grew to generate an annual revenue of Rs. 1 million in 1773. In 1759, he was captured and jailed by the Company, where he poisoned himself. After his death, Khoajah Petruse Aratoon took over as leader of the Armenian community in Bengal. *Khojah Gregory: Popularly known as Gurgin Khan, he was a brother of Khojah Petruse and a minister to Nawab Mir Qasim as well as the Commander-in-Chief of his army. He is cited by Gholam Hossein in Siyar-ul-Mutakhkherin as the chief of the artillery and the Nwab's principal serviceman. An assassin killed him after the Battle of Giria (August 1763). *Nicholas Pogose: Popularly known as Nicky Pogose, he was a zamindar, a merchant, a partner of the first bank in Bangladesh - Dhaka Bank - and one of nine commissioners of Dhaka Municipality (1874-1875).

Armenians have settled various parts of South Asia and many migrated to Karachi during the economic boom in the early 20th century. Notable Armenian settlements in Pakistan can be found in the cities of Karachi, Lahore and in the capital Islamabad. History The Ottoman and the Safavid conquests of the Armenian highlands in the 15th century CE meant that many Armenians dispersed across the Ottoman and Safavid empires, with some eventually reaching Mughal India. During the period of Akbar, Armenians -- such as Akbar's wife Mariam Begum Saheba and a Chief Justice Abdul Hai -- gained prestige in the empire. While Armenians gained prestige serving as governors and generals elsewhere in India such as Delhi and the Bengal, they were also present in Lahore. Armenian inscriptions from 1606 and 1618 have been found by archaeologists in 1901 in the Thal Chotiali, Loralai District, in Balochistan.Percy Brown, Lahore Museum (Pakistan). A descriptive guide to the Department of archaeology & antiquities, 1908, p.25Jean Philippe Vogel, ‚ÄúArmenian inscriptions in Baluchistan‚Äù, Archaeological Survey of India, 1904 There was an Armenian colony established there in the beginning of the seventeenth century.

Due to the sour plums used in its production, suanmeitang is slightly salty in addition to being sweet and rather sour. Suanmeitang is commercially available in China and other parts of the world with Chinese communities. It is often drunk chilled during the summertime, as relief from the heat, and is one of the most common summer drinks in China. In addition to being widely considered an effective drink for cooling off in the heat, it is also popularly believed to have minor health benefits, such as improving digestion and possibly inhibiting the buildup of lactic acid in the body. History Suanmeitang has existed in some form for over 1,000 years, at least since the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE); there are also reports of a variation called \\"white suanmeitang\\" (ÁôΩÈÖ∏Ê¢ÖÊ±§) during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 CE). The recipe used today is thought to have been developed at the request of the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty during the early 18th century, at which time it was first common in the imperial courts, and was later popularized among common folk when a Hebei citizen created and produced the Xinyuanzhai (‰ø°ËøúÊñã) brand. By the 1980s, companies had begun to use industrial methods and technology to mass- produce suanmeitang. Ingredients and production Suanmeitang is made by first soaking sour plums in water, then adding haw, liquorice root, and sweet osmanthus and boiling them together. Rose blossoms may also be added. After the mixture is boiled, rock sugar is added to the residue, it is boiled again, and after the beverage has cooled off it is chilled.

The squadron was formed for the first time in 1945 and was last disbanded in 1984. History 724 Squadron was first formed on 10 April 1945 as a Royal Navy naval air communications unit. The squadron made daily flights between Sydney and Melbourne until 31 May 1946 when it was disbanded. 724 Squadron was recommissioned as an Australia unit on 1 June 1955 at the Royal Australian Navy's (RAN) main air station HMAS Albatross. The squadron's role was to carry out fixed-wing conversion training and it was initially equipped with Wirraway, Hawker Sea Fury and Fairey Firefly propeller-driven aircraft and de Havilland Vampire jets. The squadron's role changed in October 1956 when it absorbed most of the decommissioned 723 Squadron's de Havilland Sea Venom fighters and Fairey Gannet anti-submarine aircraft and Bristol Sycamore helicopters. As part of this change 724 Squadron's Wirraways, Sea Furies and Fireflys were transferred to other units. In its new role the squadron provided Sea Venom and Gannet operational training on board the RAN's only aircraft carrier, HMAS Melbourne. Three 724 Squadron pilots were killed during separate flying accidents during 1956. 724 Squadron's make-up continued to change in 1957 and 1958. The Sycamores were transferred back to the recommissioned 723 Squadron in early 1957 and the Gannets moved to 725 Squadron during 1958. This left 724 Squadron equipped with Sea Vampires and Sea Venoms. In 1959 the squadron formed an aerobatic team called the Ramjets which was equipped with Sea Venoms and performed at air shows across Australia. The squadron's role and aircraft inventory expanded during the early 1960s as the RAN wound-down its fixed-wing aircraft operations. 724 Squadron absorbed 725 Squadron in June 1961 and 805 Squadron and 723 Squadron in June and November 1963 respectively. As a result of these changes the squadron's aircraft complement eventually included Sea Venoms, Gannets, Vampires, Fireflies, Dakotas and Autocars. Between 1963 and 1968 724 Squadron and 816 Squadron were the only FAA squadrons operating fixed-wing aircraft. During this time the squadron's roles included all-weather fighter, anti-submarine warfare and operational flying training along with fleet support, trials and communications tasks. de Havilland Sea Venom FAW.53 preserved in 724 Squadron markings in an aircraft museum in Melbourne in 1973 724 Squadron became an all-jet conversion training squadron again in December 1968 and was equipped with two-seat trainer variants of the new McDonnell Douglas A-4G Skyhawk, Vampires and Venoms. The Vampires and Venoms were replaced by new Aermacchi MB-326 trainers between 1970 and 1972. Despite its rating as a second-line training unit, 724 Squadron participated in some fleet exercises and used its Skyhawks to provide close air support to Australian Army units during ground manoeuvres. The squadron's Skyhawks were also used in a new aerobatic team called the Checkmates. In June 1982 HMAS Melbourne was decommissioned without being replaced. As a result, the RAN's fixed-wing aircraft squadrons were rapidly decommissioned. 724 Squadron absorbed 805 Squadron's Skyhawks in July 1982 and transferred its Macchis to the Royal Australian Air Force in 1983. The squadron was decommissioned at HMAS Albatross on 30 June 1984 and its Skyhawks were later sold to the Royal New Zealand Air Force. Notes The \\"Checkmates\\" were an aerobatic team operated by 805 Sqn (VS 805) which was the front line Skyhawk sqn. Aircraft on this team at one stage sported a chess knight logo on the tailfin instead of the red/white check pattern.

It is known from several widely dispersed locations in the western Pacific Ocean and occurs in great numbers. They are tolerant of harsh conditions and are often found in close association with elemental sulfur, including molten sulfur pools that exceed 180 ¬∞C in temperature. As they are not significantly different in appearance and feeding habits from other tonguefishes, they are thought to be relatively recent colonizers of vent ecosystems. These fish were first observed in nature in 1988, and were provisionally assigned to the species Symphurus orientalis before being recognized as a new species. The species name thermophilus is from the Greek thermos meaning \\"heat\\" and philos meaning \\"lover\\", referring to its association with hydrothermal vents. Distribution and habitat This species has a wide, disjunct distribution in the western Pacific, from the Kaikata Seamount near the Bonin Islands off southeastern Japan, to the Rumble 3 and Macauley Submarine Volcanos on the Kermadec Ridge off northern New Zealand, including the Nikko Seamount near Minami-Iohjima Island, the Minami-Ensei Knoll in the Mid-Okinawa Trough, the Kasuga-2 and Daikoku Seamounts in the Marianas Islands arc, and the Volcano-1 and Volcano-2 Seamounts in the Tonga arc. S. thermophilus likely also occurs at yet-unexplored vent sites between these locations. S. thermophilus and bythograeid crabs on the crust of a molten sulfur lake at the Nikko Seamount. S. thermophilus occurs only within relatively shallow active hydrothermal vent sites at a depth of 239‚Äì733 m, with most found between 300‚Äì400 m. Both adults and juveniles are found in the same habitats. Unusually for a vent fish, S. thermophilus favors environments that are rich in sulfur; they have been observed oriented vertically on solid sulfur walls, resting on beds of newly congealed sulfur adjacent to a rivulet of molten sulfur, and even on a thin crust of consolidated sulfur pebbles overlaying a molten sulfur bed with a temperature of 187 ¬∞C (though the crust is considerably cooler). While many flatfish species prefer a fine substrate to burrow in, S. thermophilus frequents coarse substrates and is sometimes found over solid surfaces. At the Kaikata Seamount, S. thermophilus was observed on coarse sand bottoms where water of 19-22 ¬∞C was percolating through the sediment. At the Minami-Ensei Knoll, this species was found on white metachromatic sediments in water 5-10 ¬∞C warmer than the ambient seawater. At the Kasuga-2 Seamount, it occurred on a variety of dark- and light-colored gravel sediments and on bacterial mats. Where it occurs, S. thermophilus is often extremely abundant; it is the most numerous obligate vent vertebrate known to date. At the Kaikata Seamount, they are found in such numbers that the fish overlap one another on the bottom. Point densities at the Daikoku Seamount have been recorded as high as 392 individuals per square meter; these densities are an order of magnitude higher than flatfish densities reported anywhere else. Description Four specimens of S. thermophilus from Nikko Seamount. Like other tonguefishes, S. thermophilus has a laterally flattened body with united dorsal, caudal, and anal fins. Both eyes, which are fairly large and rounded in this species, are located on the left side of the head in adults. The pectoral fins and lateral line are absent, and there is only a single, right-side pelvic fin.Tyler, J. (2005). Distribution, population characteristics and trophic ecology of a sulphophilic hydrothermal vent tonguefish (Pleuronectiformes: Cynoglossidae). M.Sc. Thesis. University of Victoria: Canada. The head is moderately long, with a blunt snout and long, broadly arched jaws. There are 4-5 rows of teeth on the upper and lower jaws of the blind side, and 2-3 and 1 rows on upper and lower jaws respectively of the eyed side. The teeth are sharp and recurved, and better developed on the blind-side jaws. The body is notably deep compared to other Symphurus species. The origin of the dorsal fin is located above the eyes and contains 88-94 rays. The dorsal fin pterygiophores and neural spines have a 1-2-2-2-2 interdigitation pattern. The pelvic fin is moderately long, contains 4 rays, and is connected to the body by a delicate membrane. The anal fin contains 74-80 fin rays. The caudal fin is relatively long and contains 14 rays. The scales are small and strongly ctenoid in shape, numbering 47-56 rows transversely and 100-112 rows longitudinally. The eyed side of the body is medium to dark chocolate brown in color, mottled with numerous dark, irregularly shaped blotches and white speckles. There are also five to eight darker, complete or incomplete crossbands. Some individuals have a white patch over two-thirds of the abdominal cavity, sometimes with bluish-green tints and bordered posteriorly by a black blotch. The abdominal area posterior to the gill opening is blackish brown and much darker than the rest of the body. Occasionally there are one or two irregular to nearly circular white spots along the body midline. The fin rays are dark at the base and lighter towards the tips, and there is an irregular dark spot at the base of the caudal fin. The blind side of the body is white, with scattered dark melanophores. The maximum known length is 8.7 cm for a male and 11.2 cm for a female. The fish from the Nikko Seamount are nearly twice as large as those from the Kasuga-2 and Daikoku Seamounts. This may be because of the higher biological productivity at Nikko, or because Kasuga-2 and Daikoku were recently colonized.Dower, J. (May 11, 2006). \\"So Where Are All The Fish?\\" NOAA Ocean Explorer. Retrieved on December 20, 2008. Biology and ecology S. thermophilus with bythograeid crabs around a \\"sulfur cauldron\\" at the Daikoku Seamount. S. thermophilus spend most of their time on the sea floor, moving forwards or backwards by undulating their bodies and sometimes burying themselves completely in the substrate. They seem to be attracted to loose sediments, probably related to the uncovering of food, and often congregate in pits. The fish frequently rest atop one another without reaction. The vent communities that co-occur with S. thermophilus differs greatly between seamounts. They co-occur with large numbers of the snail Oenopota ogasawaarna at the Daikoku Seamount, and with the abundant shrimp Opaepele loihi at the Nikko Seamount. They also frequently occur with the crab Austinograea yunohana, which are found at Nikko, Daikoku, and Kasuga-2. Large bythograeid crabs have been observed attempting attacks on the fish, though not successfully. S. thermophilus likely experiences little to no predation pressure, which coupled with the high food biomass available allows their high densities. The affinity of this species for native sulfur has yet to be explained. The morphology of S. thermophilus does not show any differences from other deepwater Symphurus species that would suggest adaptations to its unique habitat. However, S. thermophilus likely possesses extensive physiological and biochemical adaptations for coping with the harsh conditions around hydrothermal vents, such as temperature and pH fluctuations, and exposure to heavy metals. In particular, they must have high hemoglobin oxygen affinities and efficient respiratory systems to deal with the toxic hydrogen sulfide in venting fluid. S. thermophilus is also capable of tolerating pH as low as 2, akin to sulfuric acid, and can rest over pools of molten sulfur without harm. Individuals of S. thermophilus often show skeletal abnormalities such as undeveloped fin rays or fused bones, likely attributable to the vent environment. =Feeding= The diet of S. thermophilus varies significantly from seamount to seamount, with the only constant being polychaete worms, which are most important for individuals on Daikoku and Volcano-1 Seamounts. Other populations feed predominantly on crustaceans; the main prey item of S. thermophilus on the Nikko Seamount is the alvinocaridid shrimp Opaepele loihi, and on the Kasuga-2 Seamount they eat mostly palaemonid shrimp. The fish at these sites appear to be \\"sit and wait\\" predators, taking slow-moving shrimp that wander too close. By contrast, the fish at the Daikoku Seamount seem to be more active, opportunistic foragers; they do not eat many crustaceans and have been observed scavenging on dying fish that fall to the bottom after coming into contact with the volcanic plumes. Snails and sponge spicules have also been found in the stomachs of a few individuals, and in captivity they are known to consume any food offered to them. The large numbers of S. thermophilus found on sulfur crusts where there are no obvious prey items may feed directly on filaments of chemosynthetic bacteria. If so, this would represent a hitherto unknown behavior for vent fish species. =Reproduction= Reproduction is oviparous, with females releasing buoyant eggs measuring 0.9 mm in diameter. The developmental speed of the eggs increases with temperature: they hatch in one day at 26 ¬∞C, in 3 days at 20 ¬∞C, and in 14 days at 12 ¬∞C. The newly hatched fry are initially sustained by a yolk sac, and have a completely developed mouth, eyes, and digestive system by 7 days of age. The migration of the eyes begins after 30 days. Compared to other flatfish, S. symphurus is slow-growing and long-lived, with a lifespan upwards of 10 years. Growth differs between populations, due to availability of food and consequent activity level. Over half their growth in length is accomplished in the first three years, with the growth rate slowing down afterwards. Both sexes likely attain sexual maturity at around 4.4 cm long and one year of age.

They have been referred to as a \\"documentary orchestra,\\" because they perform note-perfect renditions of music which is obscure and often commercially unavailable. For some projects for which no sheet music was known to exist, they had to reconstruct charts from original recordings extracted from films. For various projects they have been reconfigured as The Beau Hunks Sextette, The Beau Hunks Saxophone Soctette, The Beau Hunks Saxophone Quartet, and The Beau Hunks Orchestra. They have recorded for the labels Movies Select Audio, EigenWijs (a division of the VPRO, the Dutch public broadcasting network), Basta Audio-Visuals, and Koch Screen. Hal Roach Film Music projects The Beau Hunks Orchestra was originally a quintet organized to perform soundtrack themes from Hal Roach film studio comedies of the 1930s, including those of Laurel & Hardy, Our Gang, The Little Rascals, Charley Chase, Thelma Todd and the Taxi Boys. The group (whose name derives from a 1931 Laurel and Hardy film Beau Hunks) gave what was intended to be their only public performance on 18 January 1992, at the Oliver Hardy centennial in Amsterdam. However, based on the success of the performance, the band decided to expand to a full orchestra and record their repertoire for commercial CD release. The Roach film music, composed mostly by Leroy Shield (without screen credit), with additional songs and cues by T. Marvin Hatley, was publicly familiar, but had never been commercially released, and the original recordings and scores were presumed lost. In the mid-1980s, Piet Schreuders, a Dutch graphic designer and radio programmer, began assembling a tape library of Hal Roach comedy themes,\\"Pop Life\\" (column) by Neil Strauss, The New York Times, August 11, 1994 transferred directly from the soundtrack of VHS tapes. Because the films contain dialogue and sound effects which occasionally obscure the music, Schreuders isolated fragments of themes without dialogue or sound effects and edited them into complete, uninterrupted versions. \\"Nobody had the original masters of these songs,\\" Schreuders told The New York Times in 1994. \\"The music wasn't available anywhere else except in the films themselves, where they could only be heard in short segments. Luckily, each song was used so many times that it was theoretically possible, given enough time and patience, to splice [each] song together.\\" Using these reconstructed recordings, Schreuders worked closely with transcribers and arrangers Peter St√∂ve, Jan Robijns, Robert Veen, and Menno Daams to perfect written charts to accurately reflect the music heard in the films. Recreations of these themes had been attempted by others, including Robert Crumb and his Cheap Suit Serenaders (1970s), Ronnie Hazlehurst (1980s), and Vince Giordano (1990s). The Beau Hunks, however, finally gave the stock music of Shield its due in a series of albums released between 1992 and 2000. The most popular of the releases was The Beau Hunks Play the Little Rascals Music (1995).AllMusic review by Jim Brenholts thumb In 2000, the Beau Hunks collaborated with the Metropole Orchestra to re-create the soundtrack to the 1936 Laurel and Hardy comedy Our Relations. A collection of original sheet music from Hal Roach films had been discovered in a Los Angeles archive in 1994 and 1995. This collection yielded Leroy Shield's notes for the score of Our Relations. Piet Schreuders studied the sheet music, identified dozens of individual themes and compared them with titles and lead sheets found in the Music Division of the Library of Congress. Using the 1936 film soundtrack as a reference, Beau Hunks arrangers transcribed themes for which no written parts could be found. As a result of this work, about 95% of the original film score could be reconstructed. Schreuders subsequently discovered that much of Shield's score for this film never made it into the released version, having ended up on the cutting room floor during post-production. Deleted were elements such as the overture, musical transitions, musical effects, and variations which unified the score as a whole. The Beau Hunks recording represents the first time in history the original Our Relations film score could be heard as Shield composed it.\\"More Great Hal Roach Background Music Coming,\\", chronicle of project at Laurel-and-Hardy.com Other projects Following the commercial and critical success of their 1992/93 Shield restorations, the Beau Hunks undertook recording projects involving forgotten but, in their estimation, historic works by American composers. These include Raymond Scott (particularly his 1937‚Äì39 six-man \\"Quintette,\\" and the Paul Whiteman Orchestra's symphonic 1937/38 \\"Chesterfield Arrangements\\" of Quintette repertoire); Ferde Grof√© (Broadway At Night; Mississippi Suite; Three Shades of Blue; and Metropolis); Edward McDowell (Woodland Sketches); and various American pioneers of the jazz saxophone.\\"Critic's Choice: Classical CDs; Digging Into the Jazz Age for Its Fiery Spirit\\" by Allan Kozinn, The New York Times, December 1, 1998 The Beau Hunks have also recorded an album with legendary jazz saxophonist Al Gallodoro.

Once a thriving commercial and educational center, Middleton was bypassed in 1859 when the Mississippi Central Railway (later Illinois Central) built its line through nearby Winona. Businesses and residents followed the railroad, and Middleton was abandoned. Little remains of the town today but its cemetery, which was restored in 1992 by the Lions Club of Winona. Originally located in Carroll County, Middleton was one of the earliest settlements in the area. Montgomery County was organized in 1871, and old Middleton was included in its boundaries. History The first known European American to settle at this site was Irelton C. DeVane. In 1790 he built a small log store used for trading with the Choctaw, whose territory this was, and with the occasional traveler. Other settlers included William Pace and his wife, who came from Kentucky in the 1820s. Mail was sent from the community by stagecoach as early as 1824. Following the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek with the United States in 1830, most of the Choctaw from the area were removed to west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. Those who remained in the state became state and US citizens. Many new European-American settlers began to arrive, hungry for land. Some brought enslaved African Americans with them or purchased others as workers. The \\"Little Log Store\\", located at the junction of the Carrollton and Shongalo roads, became a well-known trading post. Several businesses opened during the 1830s, included two general merchandise stores, two doctor's offices, a tavern, a furniture maker, a shoe factory, a large store called \\"The Big Store\\", a tailor, and a clock shop. Middleton's businesses were located around a town square. The town's residents established Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Christian churches. The town was incorporated in 1837 as \\"Irwin\\", but in 1840 its named was changed to Middleton . Unofficial names included \\"Oxford\\" and \\"Bowling Green\\". By 1840, Middleton's population had grown to 2,900. A newspaper called The Family Organ began publishing in 1843. Later businesses included The Middleton Hotel, a photographer's shop, a blacksmith shop, a carriage factory, and law offices. Industrial sites were developed along the river for waterpower: on the outskirts of town a wool mill, flour mill, cotton mill, leather tannery, and cotton factory were built. A stage coach ran from Holly Springs to Durant by way of Middleton. Middleton was one of seven locations selected in 1841 as a possible site for the University of Mississippi, and it was also considered as a site for the Mississippi capital. The Middleton Cemetery is one of the oldest in the country. It was built with a deep ditch around it resembling a moat. In 1992, the Winona Lion's Club restored the cemetery and many of its markers. Two well-regarded private schools were established in Middleton. The Judson Institute was a female academy, and The Peoples Academy was a boys school. In 1859, the Mississippi Central Railway (later Illinois Central) completed a rail line through Winona, located east. As a result of being bypassed, Middleton was abandoned in favor of the new railway town of Winona, which was designated as the county seat. Many of Middleton's business and residents relocated there. Some families returned to Tennessee and Kentucky, or moved to nearby Carrollton. During the Civil War, the town's mills were converted to manufacture products for the Confederate army. Benjamin Grierson and about 1,000 Union soldiers camped near Old Middleton before traveling to nearby Vaiden on January 1, 1863. They plundered the town.

The fast hammer action breaks hard rock into small flakes and dust and is blown clear by the air exhaust from the DTH hammer. The DTH hammer is one of the fastest ways to drill hard rock. Now smaller portable drillcat drilling rigs with DTH hammers can drill as fast as much larger truck rigs with this newer technology. The system is thought to have been invented independently by Stenuick Fr√®res in Belgium and Ingersoll Rand in the USA in the mid-1950s. History A pneumatic tool is first thought to have been used for rock drilling in 1844. Many quarries used hand held tools that required the driller to suspend himself from a rope over the quarry face in order to place the drill hole in the required position. This system used small diameter holes and was not only terribly inefficient, but very dangerous due to flying rock as a result of the inaccuracy of the drilled borehole. Some quarries used primitive top hammer machines that carried the jack hammer on a mast - the slenderness of the drill rods working with a relatively large diameter drill bit caused bore holes to deviate which sometimes meant that a bore hole might finish dangerously close to its neighbour or indeed be closer to the face of the quarry than had been intended. In any event boreholes that are not aligned correctly which are then loaded with high explosive can be extremely dangerous, resulting in rock being projected beyond the intended site. Larger quarries used big rotary machines that required huge amounts of down thrust and high rotation speeds to drive the tri-cone bit hard enough to crush the rock. This system could not be successfully used for holes below 6 inches (150mm) and the machines were very expensive to buy and to run. Another system in use was the very primitive cable tool machine (or bash and splash as it was known by the drillers) which caused a heavy bar and chisel to be lifted and dropped on the rock to crush it whilst water was introduced to create a slurry, which in the process, enabled the hole to be drilled. This system could not guarantee a finished hole size and only pure vertical holes could be drilled as the system basically relied on gravity. Debris from the hole was baled out using a baling tube with a clack valve, which was periodically dropped on a winch to capture the slurry, which was then brought to the top of the hole to be discharged. It was only when the DTH system came along that many of the problems associated with the other systems were overcome - with the DTH system the energy source is constantly behind the drill bit, the drill tubes (or drill string) are rigid being only slightly less in diameter than the drill bit, copious amounts of air can be passed through the drill string to operate the DTH Hammer which is then used to efficiently flush the bore hole clean. DTH did not require heavy down thrusts or high rotational speeds and as such a light, cheap machine could be employed to carry out the drilling process - the machine could also be worked by one man, whereas some other systems required two operatives. The benefits that DTH brought to the industry were enormous - for the first time a drill hole could be placed where it was required because DTH gave a truly aligned, straight, accurately placed, clean bore hole that could be easily charged with explosive to provide good control over the blasting process that was safer and which provided good fragmentation of the rock. Holes could be drilled to increasing depths without the loss of performance since the energy source was always directly behind the drill bit. The system was able to drill in almost all rock conditions that other systems were unable to do. Quarry faces became safer, well profiled and quarry floors were level and easier for loading equipment to operate and move across. The DTH system completely revolutionised the blast hole industry with many quarries embracing it with open arms. Eventually the larger DTH systems then found their way into other applications, such as water well drilling and construction work. It still offers the same benefits to the operator that it initially brought to the quarry industry but it is now being used in many different applications such as gold exploration, ground consolidation, geo-thermal drilling, shallow oil and gas well, directional and piling. The advent of tungsten carbide for the drill bits (the first bits were all-steel) and the development of the button drill bit coupled with the introduction of high air pressures (25 bar plus) has meant that the DTH system can compete easily and efficiently with other drilling systems. DTH tools were used to locate the trapped miners in Chile and enabled food, water, and medicine to be passed to them and communication systems to be set up that eventually led to their safe rescue. Origin of the name DTH is short for ‚Äúdown-the-hole‚Äù. Since the DTH method was originally developed to drill large-diameter holes downwards in surface-drilling applications, its name originated from the fact that the percussion mechanism followed the bit down into the hole. Applications were later found for the DTH method underground, where the direction of drilling is generally upwards instead of downwards. Technical details In DTH drilling, the percussion mechanism ‚Äì commonly called the hammer ‚Äì is located directly behind the drill bit. The drill pipes transmit the necessary feed force and rotation to hammer and bit plus compressed air or fluids for the hammer and flushing of cuttings. The drill pipes are added to the drill string successively behind the hammer as the hole gets deeper. The piston strikes the impact surface of the bit directly, while the hammer casing gives straight and stable guidance of the drill bit. This means that the impact energy does not have to pass through any joints at all. The impact energy therefore is not lost in joints allowing for much deeper percussion drilling. This is a great breakthrough for smaller portable water well drilling rigs, that before were limited. The DTH on smaller rigs now can get same results as large heavy truck rigs. With recent advances in technology DTH hammers and bits can now be operated to run at up to 500Psi, increasing the penetration speed. Uses DTH drilling is used in the construction industry to produce piles into rock, also water wells, and drilling bores for geothermal ground source heat pumps. DTH products can be used in the following applications: Mining- Drill & Blast holes in Open Pit mining, Where the drill operator will drill several holes, then fill with explosives and detonate to lift rock allowing access to ore body RC- Exploration & Pit grade control GW- Geothermal Bore Holes & Waterwells Oil & Gas- Deepwell Bore Holes : Air hammers can be used as long as cutting uplift and borehole stability are ensured. For deeper wells, new DTH technologies including water hammer and mudhammer can be used to improve drilling rates in hard rocks.

It was produced in Eastmancolor and Daieiscope for Daiei Film. An Actor's Revenge is a remake of the 1935 film of the same title (distributed in English-speaking countries as The Revenge of Yukinoj≈ç), which also starred Kazuo Hasegawa. The 1963 remake was Hasegawa's 300th roleChicago Reader: An Actor's Revenge Reviewed by Jonathan Rosenbaum as a film actor. The screenplay, written by Ichikawa's wife, Natto Wada, was based on the adaptation by Daisuke It≈ç and Teinosuke Kinugasa of a newspaper serial originally written by Otokichi Mikami that was used for the 1935 version. There is an opera, An Actor's Revenge, with music by Minoru Miki and libretto by James Kirkup and a 2008 NHK production of the same story, with Yukinoj≈ç and Yamitaro played by Hideaki Takizawa. Plot Three men ‚Äî Sansai Dobe (Ganjir≈ç Nakamura), Kawaguchiya (Sabur≈ç Date) and Hiromiya (Eijir≈ç Yanagi) ‚Äî are responsible for the suicide of seven-year-old Yukitar≈ç‚Äôs mother and father. Yukitar≈ç is adopted and brought up by Kikunoj≈ç Nakamura (Ch≈´sha Ichikawa), the actor-manager of an Osaka kabuki troupe. The adult Yukitar≈ç (Kazuo Hasegawa) becomes an onnagata, a male actor who plays female roles, taking the stage name Yukinoj≈ç. Like many of the great onnagata, particularly of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, he wears women‚Äôs clothes and uses the language and mannerisms of a woman offstage as well as on. Twenty years later, in the mid 1830s, the troupe pays a visit to Edo, where the men responsible for his parents‚Äô deaths now live. Yukinoj≈ç brings about their deaths, then, having achieved his goal, and apparently overcome by the death of an innocent woman who was part of his schemes but whom he became fond of, retires from the stage and disappears. The events are coolly observed and sardonically commented on by the Robin-Hood-like thief Yamitar≈ç, also played by Hasegawa. Title The Japanese title is Yukinoj≈ç henge (Èõ™‰πã‰∏ûÂ§âÂåñ). Yukinoj≈ç is the stage- name of the central character, who is an onnagata or oyama ‚Äî a male kabuki actor who plays women‚Äôs roles. Among the senses of henge (whose basic meaning is change of form) are ghost, spectre and apparition. The title is sometimes rendered The Avenging Ghost of Yukinoj≈ç. Yukinoj≈ç uses his stage-craft to terrify one of his enemies by creating the illusion of a ghost, but there is no supernatural element in the film. In the kabuki theatre the word henge has the technical sense of costume change. The type of play called a henge-mono (Â§âÂåñ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ) is a quick-change piece in which the leading actor plays a number of roles and undergoes many on-stage changes of costume. The title thus has as one of its senses The Many Guises of Yukinoj≈ç. The usual English title is from a line of dialogue when the character Yamitar≈ç, having learned that Yukinoj≈ç proposes to take revenge on his enemies by elaborate plots rather than killing them at the first opportunity, says to himself \\"As you might expect of an actor‚Äôs revenge, it‚Äôs going to be a flamboyant performance\\" (Yakusha no katakiuchi dakeatte, kotta mon da: ÂΩπËÄÖ„ÅÆÊïµË®é„Å°„Å†„Åë„ÅÇ„Å£„Å¶„ÄÅ„Åì„Å£„Åü„ÇÇ„Çì„Å†).

Her research focuses on the organization of the cognitive systems in immediate thought, for example, the processes that underlie problem solving and sentence comprehension. Her specific interest is in how these processes are organized, what constrains them, and how their functional organization relates to their cortical representation. To address these questions, she uses functional imaging (fMRI) studies of people while they perform complex cognitive tasks and relates the imaging data to more traditional behavioral studies of cognition and computational models. In addition, her research extends to understanding how language comprehension and problem solving are approached by individuals with unusual characteristics, including those who have had a stroke or who have autism. In recent years, Carpenter has begun to explore the field of embodied cognition through her research. Her primary starting point is a biologically-grounded account of cognition called the 'fractal catalytic model.' In this model, it is proposed that, to understand the mind/brain relation, one should first explore 'what is life' and what enables a living process to persist as an organized entity; this exploration deepens and changes our understanding of cognition and provides a new framework for the mind-brain relation.

Price (born January 3, 1932) is the founder and presiding bishop of Crenshaw Christian Center (CCC), located in South Los Angeles, California. He is known for his Ever Increasing Faith ministries broadcast, which is aired weekly on both television and radio. Early life Price was born in 1932 in Santa Monica, California, a Los Angeles suburb, the eldest son of Winifred and Frederick Price, Sr., who owned a janitorial service in West Los Angeles. Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition, Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 557 Frederick attended McKinley Elementary School in Santa Monica, Foshay Junior High, Manual Arts High School and Dorsey High School in Los Angeles, and then completed two years of schooling at Los Angeles City College. He later received an honorary diploma from the Rhema Bible Training Center (1976) and an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Oral Roberts University (1982). Both of his parents, who had once been practicing Jehovah's Witnesses at the time he met his future wife Betty, had stopped practicing the religion, and were also outspoken against all organized religions. Matthew Green, Paying the Price, ministrytodaymag.com, USA, June 30, 2005 While courting Betty, his high school sweetheart, he began attending church services with her. However, after their marriage, he stopped attending church regularly until a group of Los Angeles-area churches began sponsoring a week of old-fashioned tent revivals in the Crenshaw area. Price began attending these services with his wife. At one of these services, he received Jesus Christ as his personal savior. Soon after becoming born again, Price felt the call from God to go into the ministry, serving mostly part-time, while working as a paper cutter, as an assistant pastor in a Baptist church from 1955 to 1957. Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition, Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 557 He then pastored an African Methodist Episcopal church in Val Verde, California from 1957 to 1959. From there he served in a Presbyterian church and then joined the Christian and Missionary Alliance at West Washington Community Church in 1965. Ministry work In February 1970, Price received the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the evidence of \\"speaking in tongues,\\" an event which he considered the starting point in his own ministry. Shortly thereafter, he encountered the Bible-teaching ministry of late preacher/televangelist Kenneth E. Hagin. Price joined the neo-charismatic movement, affiliating with Word of Faith, and began to teach the messages on speaking in tongues, divine healing, and prosperity teachings. Vinson Synan, The Century of the Holy Spirit: 100 Years of Pentecostal and Charismatic Renewal, 1901-2001, Thomas Nelson, USA, 2001, p. 286 He and his wife Betty co-founded the Crenshaw Christian Center that same year in the Crenshaw section of West Los Angeles, California. =Crenshaw Christian Center= Thus, in November 1973, Price moved with about 300 church members from West Washington in Los Angeles in order to establish the Crenshaw Christian Center in Inglewood, California. Membership continued to grow, and in 1977 the church was forced to hold two services, with another service added in 1982, because the 1,400-seat sanctuary was always filled to capacity. In 1981, the church bought the old Pepperdine University campus.

Biography Carol Doris Schatz was born in Philadelphia on July 1, 1930. She married Noam Chomsky in 1949, the two having known each other since she was five years old. Her mother had been a teacher at a Hebrew school where his father was the principal.Marquard, Bryan. \\"Carol Chomsky; at 78; Harvard language professor was wife of MIT linguist\\", The Boston Globe, December 20, 2008. Accessed December 20, 2008. She was awarded a bachelor's degree in French from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951. The couple spent time living in HaZore'a, a kibbutz in Israel. Although enjoying themselves, Noam Chomsky was appalled by the Jewish nationalism and anti-Arab racism that he encountered in the country, as well as the pro-Stalinist trend that he thought pervaded the kibbutz's leftist community. \\"It also was way before there were even words about women's rights\\" according to Judith Chomsky, wife of Noam Chomsky's younger brother. Despite Carol's interest in becoming a mechanic or driving a tractor at the time of the young couple's stay in 1953, they returned to the United States. She earned a doctoral degree in linguistics from Harvard University in 1968, having attended the school in order to ensure that she would be able to make a living in the event that her husband would be sent to jail for his active opposition to the Vietnam War.Fox, Margalit. \\"Carol Chomsky, 78, Linguist and Educator\\", The New York Times, December 20, 2008. Accessed December 20, 2008. Chomsky's best-known book is The Acquisition of Syntax in Children From 5 to 10 (1969). The book investigated how children develop an understanding of the underlying grammatical structure of their native language, as well as how they use this skill to interpret sentences of increasing complexity as they get older. Despite earlier scientific beliefs that children complete their acquisition of syntax by the age of five, Chomsky's research showed that children continue to develop the skills needed to understand complex constructions beyond that age. As part of her research to understand how children develop the ability to read, she developed a method in the late 1970s called repeated reading, in which children would read a text silently while a recording of the text was played. The child would repeat the process until the text could be read fluently without the tape. Research showed that four readings accompanied by a recording could be enough to provide added reading fluency for most children. More than 100 studies have been performed on the technique, with most finding statistically significant improvements in reading speed and word recognition.Farstrup, Alan E.; and Samuels, S. Jay. \\"What Research Has to Say about Reading Instruction\\", via Google Books, p. 177 ff. International Reading Associates, 2002. . Accessed December 20, 2008.

She was born in Punjab, though she spent much of her youth in the former British summer capital of Simla in Himachal Pradesh. Coming from a conservative family, her choice of an academic career and artistic pursuits over an arranged marriage was both brave and rare.Gayatri Sinha, Transgression in Print, Palette Art Gallery, 2007 Sud studied at the College of Art, Delhi from 1962 to 1967, during the same decade that Somnath Hore was retooling and revitalizing the college's printmaking department. Anupam was the youngest member of \\"Group 8\\", an association of artists at the college that was founded by Anupam's teacher Jagmohan Chopra, and was dedicated to furthering an awareness of printmaking in India. Sud later studied printmaking at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College, London, from 1971 through 1972. It was after her return from Slade that Anupam Sud developed an intense interest in exploring clothed and unclothed human figures through the medium of etching. Anupam found inspiration in both male and female sexuality and identities. Overt takes on social issues are seldom found in Sud's art, and her figures are often self-absorbed and brooding. However, through symbolism and metaphor Sud engages with socially relevant themes, and moody depictions of interrelations between the sexes are a favorite topic in her work. Sud's etchings are made with the use of zinc plates, a difficult medium that requires both patience and precision.Amrita Jhaveri, A Guide to 101 Modern and Contemporary Indian Artists, 2005 One of Sud's best known bodies of work, the \\"Dialogue Series\\", expresses human communication between people of various sexes through a mood of mature, silent, acceptance.

She developed her skills as an artist under the mentorship of Somnath Hore in Delhi.

The film is part of Brakhage's \\"Pittsburgh trilogy\\",Senses of Cinema: Stan Brakhage a trio of documentary films Brakhage made about the city's institutions in 1971. The other two films are entitled Eyes and Deus Ex. These documentaries are about the police force and a hospital, respectively. American critic Jonathan Rosenbaum referred to The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes as \\"one of the most direct confrontations with death ever recorded on film.\\"  Production  Brakhage shot the documentary using 16mm film without synchronized sound during a visit to a morgue in Pittsburgh.IMDb entry Brakhage used a number of different film stocks in the shooting process.  Recognition  This film has been described as a study in observation and immersion, with one critic deeming Brakhage as a \\"documentarian of subjectivity\\", who uses film techniques to \\"(give) form to his eyesight.\\" This critic argues that the film's primary aim is to \\"sensitize each viewer to his own subjectivity\\". Some critics argued that the silent film style enables the viewer to form their own interpretations and judgment on the subject matter. Film critic Fred Camper described the film as \\"a curious, admittedly creepy, study of the varieties of light reflected off of skin, with luminous fluid appearing to dance with the camera\\". In a Senses of Cinema profile of Brakhage, filmmaker and curator Brian Frye wrote, \\"The key image of The Act of Seeing With One's Own Eyes is quite likely the bluntest statement on the human condition ever filmed. In the course of an autopsy, the skin around the scalp is slit with a scalpel, and in preparation for exposing and examining the brain, the face of each cadaver is literally peeled off, like a mask, revealing the raw meat beneath. That image, once seen, will never leave you.\\" Martin Smith describes the film as an act of mortality salience, a reminder of the inevitability of death and the joy of being alive. These critiques highlight the shocking, innovative and humane nature of the film. The Academy Film Archive preserved all three films in 2010.

Most species mainly occur in relatively shallow water, including estuaries. Some species are also found in deeper water, including S. thermophilus that lives at hydrothermal vents (the only flatfish known from this habitat).Tyler, J.

(2008): A new Western Pacific Tonguefish (Pleuronectiformes: Cynoglossidae): The first Pleuronectiform discovered at active Hydrothermal Vents. Zootaxa, 1839: 43‚Äì59. These species are distinguished by merged dorsal, caudal and anal fins, the absence of a lateral line and pectoral fins, and the presence of only one pelvic fin. They are sinistral flatfishes, meaning that as adults, their crania are asymmetrical, with both eyes on the left side. The largest species grows to about long.

She was also admired for her strength and beauty in contemporary works, including a wide selection of ballets by George Balanchine, and Anthony Tudor. Original ballets were created for her by a number of choreographers, including Mikhail Baryshnikov, Twyla Tharp, John Neumeier, Marcel Marceau, Martine van Hamel, and Glen Tetley. She studied with many important teachers, but Maggie Black, who trained and privately coached her in New York, was her greatest influence. Ms. Messac currently lives in Seattle, Washington where, for many years, she was on the faculty of Cornish College of the Arts. She also taught advanced ballet classes for Spectrum Dance Company. She was a permanent faculty member for the American Ballet Theater's summer intensive. Besides her involvement with dance, Magali Messac is a Gyrotonic Master Trainer. The Gyrotonic Expansion System is a conditioning program, both for dancers and the general public.

She was hired as manager of TSR, Inc. by company co-founder Gary Gygax in 1984, and was in charge of the gaming company from 1986 to 1997. Williams gained control of TSR in October 1985 when the Blume brothers sold her their controlling shares of the company. In 1996, an unexpectedly high cost of returned (unsold) fiction books and an expensive, unsuccessful foray into the collectible card game market caused a cash flow squeeze, and Williams was forced to sell TSR to Wizards of the Coast in 1997. Williams inherited the rights to Buck Rogers and a large collection of Buck Rogers memorabilia. She sold the memorabilia at auction in 2010. Early life Lorraine Williams is the granddaughter of John F. Dille who, while president of the National Newspaper Service syndicate in the 1920s, arranged for Buck Rogers to be turned into a syndicated comic strip. After Dille's death in 1957, ownership of Buck Rogers and other works passed into the Dille Family Trust through the Dille family trust, making Williams one of the beneficiaries of the Buck Rogers franchise. When the trust was sold, the Dille family retained the licensing of Buck Rogers, as well as a collection of Buck Rogers memorabilia that John F. Dille had accumulated over thirty years. Williams attended the University of California at Berkeley, where she earned a B.A. in history. After graduating, she worked at the National Newspaper Syndicate. She then became an assistant administrator at the Rush- Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center. Later, she joined the National Easter Seal Society, where she worked as an administrator. TSRBrought into TSR by Gary Gygax= Gary Gygax, co-inventor of the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons and partner in the company TSR, had been sent to Hollywood in 1982 to work on licensing the Dungeons & Dragons brand, leaving the day-to-day operations of TSR to his fellow board members, Kevin and Brian Blume. While in Hollywood, he was involved in the making of the Dungeons & Dragons animated television show and exploring the possibility of a film adaptation of the game. In the course of his work, Gygax met Flint Dille, with whom he collaborated on a series of choose-your-own-adventure-type novels and a script for an unmade Dungeons & Dragons film. In 1984, Gygax was alerted to the fact that TSR was $1.5 million in debt and the Blumes were looking for a buyer. In an attempt to bring new investment money into the company, Gygax asked Flint Dille to arrange a meeting with his sister, Lorraine Williams. Although Williams turned down Gygax's invitation to invest in TSR, Gygax did hire her, on the basis of her management experience, to manage TSR. Williams was able to deal with TSR's creditors and get money flowing back into the company again. Gygax subsequently engineered the removal of Kevin Blume as CEO due to fiscal mismanagement. However, Kevin's brother Brian had a longstanding stock option which he triggered; both brothers then sold their stock to Williams, making her the majority shareholder. Gygax considered trying to fire Williams in order to replace her with his future wife, Gail Carpenter, but was advised not to. Gygax did go to court to have the sale of stock declared illegal, claiming he had a verbal agreement with the Blume brothers to buy their stock. When the judge ruled against him, Gygax sold his remaining stock and left TSR. =In control of TSR= Williams was a financial planner who saw the potential for transforming the company into a highly profitable one. However, she supposedly disdained gaming, viewing herself as superior to gamers. Williams is rumored to have implemented an internal policy under which playing games was forbidden at the company, although former TSR employee Mike Breault has stated that he does not recall such a policy during his time in TSR, but does go on to say that the vast majority of the products were not playtested. Upon leaving TSR, Gygax had founded New Infinities Productions, Inc., and subsequently developed a new fantasy role-playing game, spanning multiple genres, called Dangerous Journeys. When the product was released by Game Designers' Workshop, (Registration required) Williams immediately sued, claiming that the game infringed TSR's intellectual property. The suit was eventually settled out of court, with TSR buying the complete rights to the Dangerous Journeys system from New Infinities and then permanently shelving the entire project. With no product to sell, Gygax's new company was driven out of business. Under Williams's direction, TSR initially maintained its leadership position in role-playing games, and solidified its expansion into other fields, such as magazines, paperback fiction, and comic books. Through her family, Williams personally held the rights to the Buck Rogers license and encouraged TSR to produce Buck Rogers games and novels. In 1988 she edited Buck Rogers: The First 60 Years in the 25th Century. TSR also published a Buck Rogers board game, a Buck Rogers XXVC role-playing game based on the AD&D; 2nd Edition rules, over a dozen supplements for the role-playing game, comic books (1990‚Äì1991), a line of 11 novels and graphic novels (1989‚Äì1993), and two computer games produced by SSI (1990‚Äì1992). As Williams' family owned Buck Rogers, TSR paid them royalties on the character. =Downfall of TSR= During the 1980s, TSR was the top games company in North America. However, in the early 1990s, TSR fell behind both Games Workshop and Wizards of the Coast in terms of sales volume. Seeing the profits being generated by Wizards of the Coast with their collectible card game Magic: The Gathering, TSR attempted to enter this market in 1996 in a novel way with Dragon Dice, a game that used packs of collectible dice instead of cards. In addition, despite a history of publishing only one or two hardcover novels each year, TSR also decided to publish twelve novels in 1996. Sales of Dragon Dice through the games trade started strongly, so TSR quickly produced several expansion packs. In addition, TSR tried to aggressively market Dragon Dice in mass-market book stores through Random House. However, Dragon Dice did not catch on through the book trade, and sales of the expansion sets through traditional games stores sold poorly. In addition, the twelve hardcover novels did not sell as well as expected. Despite total sales of $40 million, TSR ended 1996 with few cash reserves. When Random House returned an unexpectedly high percentage of the year's inventory of unsold novels and Dragon Dice for a fee of several million dollars, TSR found itself in a cash crunch. With no cash available, TSR was unable to pay their printing and shipping bills, and the logistics company that handled TSR's pre-press, printing, warehousing, and shipping refused to do any more work. Since the logistics company had the production plates for key products such as core D&D; books, there was no means of printing or shipping core products in order to generate income or secure short-term financing. Bob Abramowitz of Five Rings Publishing Group met with Williams and was able to negotiate and secure an option to purchase TSR, using funding from Wizards of the Coast. With no viable financial plan for TSR's survival, Williams sold the company to Wizards of the Coast in 1997. Auction of Buck Rogers collection In August 2010, Williams announced that she was selling what she described as the world's largest collection of Buck Rogers original comic art, prototypes, toys, books, and collectibles. This was material she had helped her father to catalog and pack up many years before. She said at the time of the announcement that her instinct had been to hold on to everything, but she had come to realize that it was more important to get the collection out into the public. The pieces of the collection were subsequently sold at auction on August 28, 2010. Buck Rogers Lawsuit In 2017, Williams advanced $250,000 to fund a trademark lawsuit between the Dille Family Trust and the Nowlan Family Trust (who represented the estate of Philip Francis Nowlan, the creator of \\"Buck Rogers\\") over who owned the rights to the \\"Buck Rogers\\" character.Eriq Gardner, \\"The Legal Battle to Bring Buck Rogers to the Big Screen\\" The Hollywood Reporter, July 20, 2018.

The rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the government of Sri Lanka, and independent observers such as the University Teachers for Human Rights and others have called it a massacre of civilians. However, the Indian Army maintains that the soldiers were fired upon and the Indian army officer in charge of the military operations, Lt. Gen. Depinder Singh, claimed that these civilians were killed in a crossfire between soldiers and rebels. Soldiers responsible for this massacre were not prosecuted by the Indian government. Background information During the British colonial period, when Sri Lanka was known as Ceylon, most civil service jobs (roughly 60%) were held by the better educated minority Sri Lankan Tamils, who comprised approximately 15% of the population. This was enabled because of the availability of western-style education provided by American missionaries and others in the Tamil-dominant Jaffna peninsula. The preponderance of Tamils over their proportionate share of the population was an issue for populist majority Sinhalese politicians, who came to political power by promising to elevate the Sinhalese people. The resultant measures as well as riots and pogroms that targeted the minority Sri Lankan Tamils, led to the formation of a number of rebel groups advocating independence for Sri Lankan Tamils. Following the 1983 Black July pogrom full- scale civil war began between the government and rebel groups. In 1987 the governments of Sri Lanka and India entered into an agreement and invited the Indian Army to be used as peacekeepers. Eventually the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) came into conflict with one of the rebel groups, namely the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). By October 1987 Indian forces were trying to wrest control of the Jaffna peninsula from the LTTE. Attack The Jaffna hospital, also known as the Jaffna Teaching Hospital and Jaffna General Hospital, is the premier healthcare providing institution within the densely populated Jaffna peninsula, situated in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. It had functioned throughout the period of civil war as a sanctuary that was out of bounds for combatants. After the deterioration of the relationship between the rebel LTTE and the IPKF, an attempt by the IPKF to capture Jaffna town was expected. Because of fears of a military operation by the Indian Army, some staff of the hospital had kept away from duty, but others had reported to work assuming that the Indian Army would be considerate because of assurances provided by the Indian Embassy in Colombo to a group of prominent Jaffna citizens that a major military action was not imminent. By October 21, 1987, which was Diwali, a high Hindu holiday, over 70 dead bodies had accumulated in the mortuary as a result of shelling and other military activities. It was on Deepavali day ‚Äì 21 October 1987 just 3 months after landing in Sri Lanka that the IPKF went on a killing spree not against the LTTE but against doctors, nurses, attendants, patients and members of public. The victims of the massacre included three leading medical specialists at that time, Dr. A. Sivapathasuntharam, Dr. K. Parimelalahar and Dr. K. Ganesharatnam, three nurses and fifteen other employees. The dead included an infant and other children. Over 70 bodies were left lying in the mortuary. The killings went from 21 October at 11 a.m. to 22 October 11 a.m. with Sivapathasuntharam, who had unexpectedly come to the hospital, being shot and killed while helping an injured worker. At about 8:30 a.m., Sivapathasundaram, the paediatrician, came walking along the corridor with three nurses. He had convinced them that they should identify themselves and surrender. They were walking with their hands up shouting: \\"We surrender, we are innocent doctors and nurses.\\" Sivapathasundaram was gunned down point blank and the nurses injured. The OPD building was shelled by the IPKF on 21 October at 11:30 a.m., the shell that fell into Ward 8 killed seven people. The IPKF burnt all the dead bodies. An infant and few other children also became the victims of the IPKF when they made noise, watching these horrors. Struck by a heart attack an aged civilian died singing the ‚ÄúsivapuraaNam‚Äù Barrels and barrels of bullets were spent on innocent patients who tried to seek help. They did the same to the children and the aged who asked for water. \\"The Indian Army came firing into the Radiology Block and fired indiscriminately at this whole mass of people huddled together. We saw patients dying. We lay there without moving a finger pretending to be dead. We were wondering all the time whether we would be burnt or shot when the bodies of the dead were collected¬ù.\\" TimelineOctober 21, 1987= *11h ‚Äì The hospital environment came under cannon fire from the vicinity of Jaffna Dutch Fort and from overhead helicopters. *11h30 ‚Äì A shell fell on the Outpatients Department (O.P.D) building. *13h ‚Äì The chief consultant on duty was informed that Indian troops had been sighted at nearby Shanti Theatre Lane. *13h30 ‚Äì A shell fell on Ward 8, killing seven persons. The chief consultant who went out with another doctor to survey the situation spotted some empty cartridges, suggesting that persons had been firing from inside the hospital premises. *14h ‚Äì The chief consultant's attention was drawn to the presence of some armed LTTE fighters inside the hospital. The chief consultant went with Dr. Ganesharatnam and asked the group to leave the premises. The leader of the group agreed and they left. *14h5 ‚Äì The chief consultant was informed that another group of LTTE men had come inside. Dr. Ganesharatnam requested that the chief consultant go with another doctor to speak to the LTTE group and ask them to leave. It is not clear if the LTTE men ever left the hospital. *14h, 16h ‚Äì A few staff members left the hospital for lunch through the back door. *16h ‚Äì Staff heard shooting for 15‚Äì20 minutes from the vicinity of the gasoline station on Hospital Road. No retaliatory fire from the hospital was heard. *16h20 and onward ‚Äì According to an eyewitness, the IPKF entered the hospital grounds through the front gate, came up along the corridor and warned everybody inside the hospital. The IPKF fired into the Overseer's office and other offices. The eyewitness saw many of his fellow workers killed, including the overseer and an ambulance driver. The eyewitness also saw a soldier throw a grenade at a man, killing several people. According to another eyewitness, the IPKF came into the Radiology room, which was filled with people including the patients evacuated from Ward 8, and fired indiscriminately. Those who pretended to be dead by lying on the floor escaped the attack. *Throughout the night a few bursts of fire and grenade explosions were heard. =October 22, 1987= *8h30 ‚Äì Dr. Sivapathasundaram was seen walking out of the hospital with three nurses. They were walking with their hands up shouting, \\"We surrender, we are innocent doctors and nurses.\\" Shots were fired; Dr. Sivapathasundaram was killed and the nurses injured. *11h ‚Äì An Indian Army officer turned up at one of the wards and was confronted by a doctor. The doctor explained the situation to the officer and later, with help of the officer, she called out to her colleagues and those who were injured to come out with their hands up. About 10 staff members who were alive were escorted out. They found their colleague Dr. Ganesharatnam dead. Later in the day all the dead bodies in the hospital were collected and burned. Reactions The Indian Army had maintained that it was fired upon from inside the hospital and people were caught in a crossfire. This was reiterated by Lt. Gen. Depinder Singh. p.125 The rebel LTTE and the government of Sri Lanka have maintained that it was an unprovoked massacre of civilians. The government of Sri Lanka in 2008 termed it a crime against humanity. A number of independent observers such as University Teachers for Human Rights, a Human Rights organization from Sri Lanka, and western observers such Mr. John Richardson and others maintain that it was a massacre of civilians. In popular culture The massacre and other alleged atrocities of the war are covered in the award-winning 2002 film In the Name of Buddha directed by Rajesh Touchriver.

Frank Baum, famous as the creator of the Land of Oz. The book was Baum's first effort at writing specifically for an audience of adolescent boys, a market he would pursue in the coming years of his career. The novel was first published in 1906, under the pen name \\"Capt. Hugh Fitzgerald,\\" one of Baum's multiple pseudonyms. Audiences and markets In the years around the turn of the twentieth century (1897‚Äì1905), Baum had succeeded in establishing himself as a popular author of children's books, most notably with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). By the middle of the twentieth century's first decade, he was working diligently to branch out into other markets. In 1905 he released his first adult novel, The Fate of a Crown (as the work of \\"Schuyler Staunton\\"); in 1906 he issued his first books for adolescent girls, Annabel (as by \\"Suzanne Metcalf\\") and Aunt Jane's Nieces (by \\"Edith Van Dyne\\"), as well as his first book for boys.Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; pp. 134‚Äì401. The 1906 Sam Steele title was the first book in a projected series; \\"Capt. Fitzgerald\\" followed up with Sam Steele's Adventures in Panama in 1907. The story Unusually for Baum, the tale of Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea is told in the first person, by the title character. Sam Steele is the son of a sea captain; his father is reported killed in a shipwreck, and Sam is quickly cheated of his inheritance. Now an orphan, he meets his maternal uncle, Naboth Perkins, another sea captain and ship-owner; together the two set sail in the Pacific trade. Sam Steele \\"is a stereotyped ideal: a capable, brave, enterprising, likable, manly sixteen-year-old American.\\"Rogers, pp. 140‚Äì1. From San Francisco, Sam and his uncle embark on Naboth's ship the Flipper, carrying provisions north for the miners of the Alaska Gold Rush. A storm casts them onto a remote island, occupied by stranded and desperate miners who have struck a rich goldfield. The crew of the Flipper have to cope with thieves and the hazards of nature before they can return with ample rewards for their trouble. At home again, Sam and Naboth discover that Sam's father Captain Steele has survived shipwreck (with the loss of a leg). Re-united with his father, Sam regains his lost patrimony. Baum's plot was influenced by Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island and by H. Rider Haggard's She.David Maxine, \\"Fat Babies for Dinner,\\" Oz-story Magazine No. 1 (June 1995), p. 3. In turn, Baum borrowed elements from his first Sam Steele book when he came to write The Sea Fairies five years later. He turned his character Naboth Perkins into Cap'n Bill in the later book.Rogers, p. 141. The bias question As with other traditional authors and their books (Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn being probably the most famous example),James S. Leonard et al., Satire of Evasion?: Black Perspectives on \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", Durham, NC, Duke University Press, 1992. the role of racism and other prejudices in Baum's books has been a focus of attention from critics and readers. Baum repeatedly displays a resistance to, and rejection of, prejudice and xenophobia in his works ‚Äì but he also exploits the stereotypes common in his era, usually for comic effect. (See: Sky Island; Daughters of Destiny; Father Goose: His Book; Father Goose's Year Book.) Material in the first Sam Steele book bears upon this subject. Two key supporting characters are men from the Sulu Archipelago nicknamed \\"Nux\\" and \\"Bryonia;\\" the gruffer characters in the book refer to them as \\"niggers.\\" The two become friends and companions of Sam Steele, and are presented as unflinchingly loyal, reliable, courageous, caring, strong, and resourceful. After one crisis in their adventures, Sam remarks, \\"I realized, with a grateful heart, that I owed all my good fortune and narrow escapes to the faithful Sulu men...;\\" Uncle Naboth expresses his satisfaction that the two men accompany Sam, for \\"Those men are as faithful and honest as any men on earth....\\"Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea, Chapters 14 and 15. (For a comparable affirmative portrayal of South Sea islanders, see Baum's short story \\"The Tiger's Eye.\\") Later editions The two Sam Steele books of 1906 and 1907 did not sell as well as their author and publisher had hoped they would. Reilly & Britton did not give up on the project, however; they re- issued both books with new titles in 1908, under yet another pen name, \\"Floyd Akers.\\" (A possible derivation: \\"F. Akers\\" from \\"fakers.\\")Raylyn Moore, Wonderful Wizard, Marvelous Land, Bowling Green, OH, Bowling Green University Popular Press, 1974; p. 70.

The buildings still stand, although there is no monastic community there. Known as Ribe Kloster, it is Denmark's most complete extant monastic building complex. History The Dominican priory in Ribe, dedicated to Saint Catherine of Siena, was founded in 1228 by Dominican friars on property given to them by Tuve, Bishop of Ribe, only the second such foundation in Denmark. The church, dedicated to Saint Catherine, was built in Romanesque style with a simple nave and chancel of brick. They also built an attached conventual building.Main entrance to St. Catherine's church, formerly the Dominican priory churchBy 1246 the priory was substantial enough for the provincial meeting of the order to be held there. As Ribe became Denmark's largest and most prosperous town, the priory was reconstructed and expanded in the early 14th century with a larger towerless church and a quadrangular set of buildings providing the friars with privacy from the rest of the community. The new construction was in the Gothic style. A large cellar was built beneath the south range. In the late 14th century the priory was sacked along with rest of Ribe: a papal letter enjoined the community and monks to reconstruct it. The Dominicans were primarily missionaries who vowed to be chaste, obedient, and poor, and were established in towns where they or their representatives could go out and beg their daily bread from local residents. Their rule forbade them to own anything individually, but over the years individuals and families gave income-producing properties to support the community. The Dominicans also accepted gifts for the privilege of burying family members inside the priory church. Construction continued through the 15th century as the church was expanded to three aisles and the ranges lengthened to their present size. Then fire ravaged part of the buildings and reconstruction was encouraged by the pope himself. Christian I gave a substantial amount of money to the priory in 1480. A covered cloister was built, and several outbuildings were constructed nearby. Dissolution By the late 1520s many Danes wanted an end to the many tithes, fees, rents, forced work, and endless requests for food, clothing, and money by the Catholic Church. Their anger was first vented on what they nicknamed the \\"beggar monks\\" (), the Franciscan and Dominican friars. In Ribe the Franciscans were ejected first, then the Dominicans were expelled from the priory; some become laymen and remained in Denmark, while others left the country for Dominican houses in central Europe. Denmark became a Lutheran state in 1536 in the Reformation. All religious houses and their income properties reverted to the crown. The priory church was converted for use as Ribe's second parish church, which it remains, still called St. Catherine's. The other monastic and religious communities in Ribe were all closed.the Benedictine nunnery, St. Nicholas' Priory; the Franciscan friary; the priory of the Knights Hospitallers; St. George's leper hospital; and the Hospital of the Holy Ghost. Several superfluous churches were also demolished: St. Peter's (1145), St. Clement's {1145}, St. John's, St. Michael's, St. Bartholomew's, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre The Dominican priory was converted for use as the city hospital in 1543 by order of Christian III for the care of the sick, poor and weak, and remained so for many years. In about 1600 part of the former conventual buildings was turned into the cathedral school. In the 18th century the eastern range began to fall down and was demolished. Part of the hospital was used as a lunatic asylum until 1860. By 1825 the buildings were in need of serious repair and an extensive restoration was conducted to preserve them. In 1865 the entire hospital was converted into apartments for the elderly poor. In 1918 the entire complex was restored once again to what architects believed was the original appearance. The church restoration to its Gothic origins was finally complete and a tower added for the first time. The buildings, known as Ribe Kloster, situated in a park, remain a prominent feature of central Ribe.

The film stars Melville (who also wrote the screenplay) and Pierre Grasset as two French journalists in New York City searching for a missing United Nations diplomat. Though Melville occasionally played bit parts in films by other directors (most notably as Parvulesco in Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless), Two Men in Manhattan was his only starring role and the only time he acted in one of his own films (he served as the off-screen narrator in Bob le flambeur). Plot After a hard day's work, the reporter Moreau is asked by his boss to find out why the head of the French delegation to the United Nations has suddenly disappeared. Moreau drags out of bed the unscrupulous photographer Delmas, who knows his way round Manhattan at night. Together they visit women the diplomat knew: an actress in a play, a jazz singer in a recording studio, a stripper in a burlesque show, a prostitute in an expensive brothel. Stopping off in a bar, they hear from a news flash that the actress has tried to kill herself and is in hospital. Bluffing their way into her room, they bully the distressed woman into telling the truth: the ambassador is dead in her apartment, presumably from a heart attack. Taking a photograph of her in bed and stealing her keys, they rush round to find the corpse fully clothed on a sofa. Delmas removes some clothing and puts the body in the bed for a better picture. Ringing his boss to say the search is at an end, Moreau is told to keep it all quiet. Delmas wants the money he can make from his pictures so he pretends to allow Moreau's boss to destroy the rolls of film, but runs off with the real ones. All night the two have been trailed by a mysterious car, whose driver turns out to be the diplomat's daughter. She is desperate to locate her father, a national hero for his role in the Resistance, and to protect her mother. Joining forces with Moreau, the two go round all the magazines and press agencies to find where Delmas has sold his films. Then they go looking for him in clubs and bars, eventually at dawn finding him in one asleep. Moreau tells him what he thinks of him, knocks him to the floor, and leaves with the girl. Coming to, Delmas staggers out and throws the unsold films down a grating.

He composed songs for Chinese films beginning in the 1930s, some of which remain popular. At the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, He won a contest in 1934, which was sponsored and judged by the Russian composer Alexander Tcherepnin, for his composition Buffalo Boy's Flute (). His best-known compositions are \\"Song of the Four Seasons\\" () and \\"The Wandering Songstress\\" (Â§©Ê∂ØÊ≠åÂ•≥, with lyrics by Tian Han), both composed for the 1937 film Street Angel and sung by Zhou Xuan. He also wrote the music for the patriotic song \\"Guerrillas' Song.\\" In September 1949 He was appointed director of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. 1966 saw the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, a fanatical movement meant to weed out \\"revisionism\\" and the remnants of \\"traditional\\" culture, and a wave of terror engulfed every sector of society. In the spirit of proletarian solidarity, \\"bourgeois\\" artists were subject to vicious public humiliation, and some chose suicide as a way out. An astonishing incident took place on Chinese television. He Luting, who had drawn fire from a proletarian- minded critic for defending the music of Claude Debussy, was subjected to a physically abusive interrogation but refused to apologize. \\"Your accusations are false!\\" he shouted. \\"Shame on you for lying!\\" Alex Ross stated that no composer had ever made a braver stand against totalitarianism. At the end of the Cultural Revolution, He Luting was able to return to his position as Director of the Shanghai Conservatory and allowed to travel overseas, visiting Australia in 1979. In 1984 he retired from his position, retaining the title of honorary director. The main concert hall at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music is named after He.

The station, established in 1951, is currently owned by the Willamette Broadcasting Company. Programming KYKN broadcasts a news/talk radio format to the Salem, Oregon, area that includes select programming from Premiere Radio Networks and Salem Radio Network (SRN). KYKN programs include syndicated conservative-leaning talk shows hosted by Rush Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck. HistoryLaunch as KGAE= This station began broadcasting in 1951 as KGAE with 1,000 watts of power, daytime-only, on a frequency of 1430 kHz. The station, licensed to serve the city of Salem, Oregon, was owned by a partnership known as Allen, Truhan, & Clark with partner W. Gordon serving as president and general manager. This partnership would be soon dissolved leading to a now-oft cited court case that went all the way to the Oregon Supreme Court. As a result, Allen took control of the stations in 1952 with the broadcast license transferred to a new company called KGAE, Inc. Allen remained president but Hal Davis took over the general manager duties. =Change to KGAY= In 1956, the station's call sign was changed to KGAY and the name of the license holding company was changed to KGAY, Inc., with W. Gordon Allen still in control. That same year, KGAY was authorized to increase the power of its broadcast signal to 5,000 watts although it was still restricted to daytime operation. After a succession of station managers through the 1950s, W. Gordon Allen resumed the general manager duties in 1959. By this time Allen, who owned a two-thirds interest in flagship KGAY, had also acquired a 70% interest in KGAL in Lebanon, Oregon, and a 48% interest in KMAT in Winnsboro, Louisiana, as part of his W. Gordon Allen Stations group. After nearly a decade of ownership, W. Gordon Allen and KGAY, Inc., agreed to sell the station to a company known as Radio Wonderful Willametteland, Inc. The deal was consummated on July 1, 1961. Glen M. Stadler took the title of general manager while Robert Bruce was named station manager. Stadler owned a one-third interest in KGAY, as did his partners Harry Rubenstein and Alex Dreier. The three men also owned equal shares in KGAL in Lebanon, Oregon. Stadler was the sole owner of KEED and KEED-FM in the Springfield-Eugene, Oregon, area. By the end of the 1960s, KGAY, Inc., was wholly owned by Glen Stadler and his wife, Helen N. Stadler, who also served as vice president of the company. In 1968, the Stadlers announced their intention to retire from radio to \\"enter the academic field\\" and so they put KGAY up for sale. They contracted to sell the station to Capitol Equities, Inc., for a reported cash price of $175,000. The deal closed on August 15, 1968, and Donald H. Cushing took over as president of the company with Leslie J. Manning as general manager. By 1970, the station was airing a pure country & western music format. They would maintain this focus on country music throughout the 1970s. =KYKN today= In April 1985, the station applied to the Federal Communications Commission to make major changes to their licensed operation: add nighttime service with 5,000 watts of power, add a directional antenna array to the new nighttime signal, and change the legal community of license from Salem to nearby Keizer, Oregon. The FCC granted a new construction permit to authorize these changes on September 18, 1985, and, after one extension, the station received its license to cover these changes on January 16, 1987. While these changes were underway, the station was assigned the KYKN call sign by the FCC on May 15, 1986. The station slogan was \\"Kickin County\\". The station remained a country music format until it switched to news/talk in the spring of 1991.. DJ Tim O'Brian signed off the country music format with \\"The Last Cowboy Song\\" by Ed Bruce on a Sunday evening at midnight. The Station signed on at 5:00 am Monday as News/Talk broadcasting CNN Headline news. In April 1991, Capitol Equities Corporation reached an agreement to sell this station to Willamette Broadcasting Company, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 1, 1991, and the transaction was consummated on September 18, 1991.

These orders may affirm or reverse the Michigan Court of Appeals, may remand a case to the trial court, or may adopt a correct Court of Appeals opinion. Cases come before the Court during a term that starts August 1 and runs through July 31 of the following year. The Court hears oral arguments in Lansing beginning in October of each term. Decisions are released throughout the term, following oral arguments. In addition to its judicial duties, the Supreme Court is responsible for the general administrative supervision of all courts in the state. The Supreme Court also establishes rules for practice and procedure in all courts. **Michigan Court of Appeals The Michigan Court of Appeals is one of the highest volume intermediate appellate courts in the country. It was created by the 1963 Michigan Constitution and heard its first cases in January 1965. Generally, decisions from final orders of a circuit court, as well as some probate court and agency orders, may be appealed to the court as a matter of right. Other lower court or tribunal decisions may be appealed only by application for leave to appeal, i.e., with permission of the court. The court also has jurisdiction to hear some original actions, such as complaints for mandamus or superintending control against government officers or actions alleging that state law has imposed an unfunded or inadequately funded mandate on local units of government. The judges of the Court of Appeals sit state-wide, although they are elected or appointed from one of four districts. The districts and their office locations are as follows: District I is based in Detroit, District II is based in Troy, District III is based in Grand Rapids, and District IV is based in Lansing. Hearings are held year-round before three-judge panels in Detroit, Lansing, and Grand Rapids. There is no courtroom at the Troy location. Hearings are also scheduled in Marquette and in a northern Lower Peninsula location in the spring and fall of each year for the convenience of the parties and their attorneys in those areas. Judges are randomly assigned to panels to sit in all courtroom locations so that a variety of judicial viewpoints are considered. At least two of the three judges on a panel must agree on the ruling in a case for it to be binding. Like most appellate courts, the Court of Appeals observes the principle of stare decisis so that the holding in an earlier decision serves as binding precedent in a later appeal. When a panel expresses its disagreement with a prior opinion, the court rules provide a mechanism by which a special seven-judge ‚Äúconflict panel‚Äù may be convened to resolve the conflict between the earlier opinion and the later decision. MCR 7.215(J). Decisions of the court may generally be appealed by leave application to the Michigan Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals started with only nine judges originally. The number of judgeships steadily increased through legislation over the years to accommodate the court's growing caseload‚Äîto 12 in 1969, to 18 in 1974, to 24 in 1988, and to 28 in 1993. Due to decreased filings in recent years, the size of the court was reduced in 2012 to 24 judges, which is to be achieved through attrition over time. ***Michigan Circuit Courts In Michigan, the Circuit Court is the trial court with the broadest powers in Michigan. In general, the Circuit Court handles all civil cases with claims of more than $25,000 and all felony criminal cases (cases where the accused, if found guilty, could be sent to prison). The family division of Circuit Court handles all cases regarding divorce, paternity, adoptions, personal protection actions, emancipation of minors, treatment and testing of infectious disease, safe delivery of newborns, name changes, juvenile offenses and delinquency, juvenile guardianship, and child abuse and neglect. In addition, the Circuit Court hears cases appealed from the other trial courts or from administrative agencies. The friend of the court office is part of the family division of the Circuit Court and handles domestic relations cases where minor children are involved. There are 57 Circuit Courts in Michigan. Circuit Court judges are elected for six-year terms. ****Michigan District CourtsMichigan Local Trial Court Links . Michigan District Courts are often called the people's courts. More people have contact with the District Courts than any other court. The District Courts handles most traffic violations, all civil cases with claims up to $25,000, landlord-tenant matters, most traffic tickets, and all misdemeanor criminal cases (generally, cases where the accused, if found guilty, cannot be sentenced to more than one year in jail). In addition, small claims cases are heard by a division of the District Courts. In Michigan, a few municipalities have chosen to retain a municipal court rather than create a District Courts. The municipal courts have limited powers and are located in Grosse Pointe, Grosse Pointe Farms, Grosse Pointe Park, and Grosse Point Shores/Grosse Pointe Woods. There are approximately 100 district courts in Michigan. District court judges are elected for six-year terms. ****Michigan Probate Courts The Probate Court handles wills, administers estates and trusts, appoints guardians and conservators, and orders treatment for mentally ill and developmentally disabled persons. There are 78 Probate Courts in Michigan; probate judges are elected for six-year terms. ***Michigan Court of Claims Michigan also has a Court of Claims for filing cases against the State of Michigan in which a claim for money damages is made. The Court of Claims is part of the Michigan Court of Appeals as the Supreme Court would select four appellate court judges and its presiding judge. The Court of Claims is a specialized court that handles only claims over $1,000 filed against the State of Michigan or one of its departments. The court would hear Open Meetings, Freedom of Information and Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights acts cases. From the late 1970s to November 12, 2013, the Circuit Court 30th District (Ingham County, home to the capital) acted as the state's courts of claim.

Global organizations deal with legal discovery and disclosure requests for electronically stored information \\"ESI\\" and paper documents on a regular basis. Over 90% of all cases settle prior to trial. Often an organization will spend significant time and money on a case only to find they want to settle for whatever reason. Legal discovery costs are usually the most burdensome financially to both plaintiff and defendant. Often, and during cases in the United States, an opposing party will strategize on how to make it as difficult as possible for you to comply with the discovery process, including time and cost to respond to discovery requests. Because of this, organizations have a continued need to conduct early case assessment to determine their risks and benefits of taking a case to trial without painful settlement discussions. Many service organizations, law firms, and corporations refer to early case assessment differently. Consultants hired by the corporation or law firm on a case manage cases on a risk basis. There also exist a number of software tools that assist in and help facilitate the process of early case assessment. Effective early case assessment might require the combination of professional expertise and software. This pairing, depending on the professional and tools used can provide various degrees of early case assessment review. Early case assessment, as a managed process, often requires customization to each case and the client involved. The early case assessment lifecycle will typically include all of the following: #Perform a risk-benefit analysis. #Place and manage a legal hold on potentially responsive documents (paper and ESI) in appropriate countries. #Preserve information abroad. #Gather relevant information for attorney and expert document review. #Process potentially relevant information for purposes of filtering, search term, or data analytics. #Information hosting for attorney and expert document review, commenting, redaction. #Produce documents to parties in the case. #Reuse information in future cases. Early case assessment software is typically used by attorneys, corporate legal departments, risk managers, forensics teams, IT professionals and independent consultants to help them analyze unstructured electronically stored information. The software approach to early case assessment typically includes the following: #Determine the source files to analyze. #Point the analysis tool to the files to be analyzed. #Set parameters for the assessment. #Allow the program to automatically scan and assess the data, which may be located on local hard drives, removable media, file servers, whole networks, etc.) #Review reports generated by the software.

It dominated the mainstream political life of the Ukrainian minority in Poland,Encyclopedia of Ukraine, National Democratic Party, written by Vasyl Mudry which with almost 14% of Poland's population was the largest minority within that country. UNDO was founded in 1925 and dissolved during the Soviet annexation of western Ukraine in 1939. Throughout the interwar years, UNDO enjoyed both German and Soviet financial support in their struggle against Poland.Andrzej A. Ziƒôba (2010). Lobbing dla Ukrainy w Europie Miƒôdzywojennej. Ukrai≈Ñskie Biuro Prasowe w Londynie oraz jego konkurenci polityczni (do roku 1932). Krak√≥w: Ksiƒôgarnia Akademicka, pp. 136-7, 151 Political programme UNDO like other western Ukrainian political parties considered Polish rule over current western Ukraine to be illegitimate, advocating the independence of western Ukraine. It sought to promote Ukrainians' well-being within the Polish state until independence could be achieved, and in so doing opposed the terrorism and violence of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists because such actions resulted in negative repercussions on the Ukrainian population. UNDO was essentially democratic in nature, guided by varying amounts of Catholic, liberal, and socialist ideology.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 18-19 UNDO supported constitutional democracy and the \\"organic development\\" of Ukrainian society that would prepare it for independence once the opportunity arose. The approach of \\"organic development\\" focused on building up Ukrainian institutions, promoting Ukrainian education, and fostering Ukrainian self- reliance organizations that could operate independently from the Polish authorities. In so doing, UNDO hoped to achieve through peaceful means that which was not attained through war. UNDO supported agrarian reform and the development and expansion of the Ukrainian cooperative movement, particularly agricultural and financial cooperatives. UNDO also maintained close relations with the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.Orest Subtelny. (1988). Ukraine: a History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 434-441 Ukrainian women's organizations actively participated in UNDO, which sent a woman representative to the Ukrainian parliament where she attained the position of party spokesperson.Sharon L. Wolchik and Alfred G. Meyer. (1985). Women, State, and Party in Eastern Europe . Duke University Press. pp.89-90 UNDO pursued a dual policy with respect to Poland's next largest minority, the Jews. UNDO protested acts of antisemitism and cooperated with Jewish representatives in the Polish parliament.Philip Friedman. Ukrainian-Jewish Relations During the Nazi Occupation. In Roads to Extinction: Essays on the Holocaust. (1980) New York: Conference of Jewish Social Studies. pg. 177 It supported Jewish civil rights and fought against Polish attempts to limit Jewish cultural practices.Emanuel Melzer. (1997). No way out: the politics of Polish Jewry, 1935-1939 Hebrew Union College Press: pp.113-130 For example, UNDO's representatives in the Polish parliament joined their Jewish colleagues in voting against an attempt to limit kosher slaughtering. UNDO's support for the Jews was largely driven by the belief that actions against Jews would set a precedent for future discrimination against Ukrainians. Following a Polish pogrom against Jews in 1936, an UNDO leader published an article called \\"After the Jews Will Come Our Turn.\\" Despite its rejection of violence and discrimination against Jews, UNDO also engaged in an economic struggle against them by supporting Ukrainian cooperatives through boycotting non-Ukrainian (and thus, often, Jewish) businesses. While rejecting Polish offers of cooperation against Jews, UNDO spokesmen also blamed Jews for spreading Communism in Ukrainian villages. Seeing Poland as the main enemy, in the 1920s while Soviet Ukraine was experiencing a cultural revival, a significant segment of the UNDO leadership had a pro-Soviet orientation. Dmytro Levytsky, party leader, wrote in 1925, \\"We are firmly convinced that, much like abstract communism, the Soviet form of government is alien to the mindset of the Ukrainian nation. But as we register facts, we cannot make note of certain facts while ignoring others. Therefore, we state the well-known and unquestionable fact that the national idea is growing, strengthening, and developing in Soviet Ukraine.\\"We and the Empire, article by Stanislav Kulchitsky, in the newspaper Day, February 14th, 2006 After Ukrainization ended, and news of Soviet crimes devastating Ukrainian society in the 1930s (such as the Holodomor and Executed Renaissance) filtered into western Ukraine, UNDO radically altered its position towards the Soviet Union, coming to consider it the principal enemy of Ukraine. With this in mind, UNDO's programme evolved into seeking a new understanding with Poland. This alienated some of its supporters and brought it into conflict with the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists.Political Activities of the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance Summary of Dissertation defended by Boris Gregorovich Khruslov, Chernivtsi University, 2000 (Ukrainian) History Kost Levytsky UNDO was founded at a party congress in 1925 through the merger of three western Ukrainian political parties, under the leadership of Dmytro Levytsky. It was the direct descendant of the prewar Ukrainian National Democratic Party, which had been the leading western Ukrainian political party during Austrian rule through western Ukraine's failed war of independence against Poland. The vast majority of western Ukraine's intelligentsia and clergy were members of UNDO. Prominent figures in the party included Kost Levytsky, former head of the government of the West Ukrainian National Republic, Dmytro Levytsky, who led the party for ten years, and Vasyl Mudry, who would become the speaker of Poland's parliament (the Sejm). UNDO's members controlled many of the region's Ukrainian financial, cooperative, and cultural institutions, including the principal western Ukrainian newspaper . During the elections, it obtained approximately 600,000 votes and a large majority of the Ukrainian seats in the Polish parliament. Its main competitor within the Ukrainian community, the socialist Ukrainian Radical Party, received 280,000 votes. In 1930, in response to terrorist activities of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Poland initiated a policy referred to as Pacification, which involved mass arrests and beatings of Ukrainian activists, burning down of Ukrainian reading rooms and cooperatives, and closing of Ukrainian private schools. UNDO's representatives in the Polish parliament led the Ukrainian delegation in sponsoring a motion condemning these acts. After the motion's rejection, the Ukrainian parliamentarians appealed to the League of Nations, which reprimanded the Polish government.Ukraine: A Concise Encyclopedia.(1963). Editor: Volodymyr Kubiyovych. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 838-848 During the parliamentary elections of that year, the Polish government tried to deter the Ukrainian people from voting for Ukrainian parties. UNDO formed a temporary coalition with the other Ukrainian parties that won 21 seats in the House of deputies (17 of which were held by UNDO) and four seats in the Senate (3 of which were held by UNDO). Despite UNDO's presence in the parliament, anti-Ukrainian actions by the Polish state accelerated. Laws were passed which stipulated that only people who could speak and write Polish could serve as county or city officials, and four fifths of Ukrainian judges were removed from their positions or transferred to Central and Western Poland. By 1932, the relentless Polish pressure combined with the perception, based in part on the Holodomor and other Soviet atrocities affecting the Ukrainian population, that the Soviet Union not Poland was Ukraine's principal enemy, induced many of UNDO's leaders to seek some sort of accommodation with the Polish government. In March 1935, UNDO reached a compromise with the Polish government known as \\"Normalization.\\" In exchange for UNDO agreeing to work with the Polish government, Ukrainians were guaranteed nineteen seats total in both houses of the Polish parliament, as well as the position of vice-marshal (speaker) of the Polish parliament, many Ukrainian political prisoners were amnestied, and credits were given to Ukrainian cooperatives.Paul Robert Magocsi. (1996). A History of Ukraine. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pg. 598. Russophile representation was also eliminated, and the status quo in Ukrainian schooling was maintained.Encyclopedia of Ukraine, \\"Normalization\\" article written by Andrzej Ziƒôba Dmytro Levytsky, party leader from 1925-1935 UNDO's efforts to reach an agreement with the Polish government led to fractures within the party. In 1933 a group of UNDO members led by Dmytro Paliiv left UNDO to form another party that was uncompromisingly opposed to both Poland as well as the Soviet Union. Although this new party was more nationalistic and authoritarian, it was legal and continued UNDO's opposition to the terrorism of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. Because the Poles were only willing to apply concessions to Galicia, and not to Volhynia, UNDO's leader Dmytro Levytsky resigned from his post as head of the party. While not resigning from the party itself, he went into internal opposition. Levytsky was supported by many of UNDO's members and by the editorial board of the newspaper Dilo. This split incapacitated the party. Levytsky was replaced as head of the party by Vasyl Mudry, who became speaker of the Polish parliament. During Normalization, UNDO pressed the Polish government for more substantial changes, such as cultural autonomy in western Ukraine, improvement in elementary and secondary education, a Ukrainian university, self-government, elimination of Polish colonization of Ukrainian lands, more access to administrative positions within the Polish state, and others. These demands were generally ignored by the Polish authorities, which led to a loss of credibility for Normalization among many Ukrainians. As a result, in 1938 UNDO proclaimed that Normalization had failed and that Poland opposed Ukrainian political life; it once again demanded autonomy for Poland's Ukrainian minority. At the same time, Germany's puppet government in Czechoslovakia granted autonomy to Slovakia's ethnic Ukrainian region, Carpatho-Ukraine. When in December 1938 articles began to appear in the German press supporting a Ukrainian state that would include parts of Poland, UNDO's leader informed the German ambassador in Warsaw that he saw no hopes for Polish-Ukrainian cooperation and that he hoped for German support. As a result, Poland pressed Germany to allow Hungary to annex Carpatho-Ukraine and when Hungary did so in 1939 Poland exploited Ukrainian disappointment in order to improve relations, and once again promised autonomy. When Germany invaded Poland, UNDO declared its loyalty to the Polish state.Time Magazine, \\"National Glue\\". Monday September 11, 1939. After the Soviets annexed Eastern Poland, UNDO's former leader, Dr. Dmytro Levitsky, who had once been chief of the Ukrainian delegation in the pre-war Polish parliament, as well as many of his colleagues, were arrested, deported to Moscow, and never heard from again.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pg. 65 UNDO along with all other legal Ukrainian political parties was forced by the Soviet authorities to disband.

The condition appears to be genetically determined and caused by the presence in the nose of erectile tissue which may become engorged during sexual arousal, as a side effect of the signals from the autonomic nervous system that trigger changes in the genitals of both men and women. A related condition called sexually induced sneezing also exists, where people sneeze, sometimes uncontrollably, when engaging in or even thinking about sexual activity.

About 800 students and 40 certified faculty members welcomed one of the first ultra- modern school facilities in Mississippi, all-electric with central heat and air.http://www.vwsd.k12.ms.us/schools/wc/profile.htm In 1967, Warren Central Junior High School was built on the campus adjacent to the high school building. To meet the need of an expanding student population, a new junior high school facility was constructed in 1973 on the land across the highway from the high school. The original junior high school building was converted into Building B of the high school. By 1982, Warren Central's enrollment peaked with more than 2,000 students and a curriculum of approximately 170 courses. A nature trail and outdoor classroom area was constructed adjacent to the campus in 1990 with help from the International Paper Company. In 2006, a new Fine Arts building was constructed to house the Big Blue Band and Choral programs. As of 201920 the school reported 1,331 students enrolled.

The Australians had entered the town to hold discussions at the Iraqi Army barracks when they were engaged by a large number of insurgents in an intense exchange of fire during which a number of insurgents were killed. The incident lasted almost an hour and although a number of insurgents were killed it was considered to have been a well coordinated attack. The Australians then withdrew in good order without loss of life, injury or serious damage to equipment. Noonan, Gerard, Skehan, Craig and Desmond O'Grady, \\"Australian Troops Close Shave in Iraq Firefight\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 29 September 2006. Although a small incident with few tactical‚Äîand no strategic‚Äîconsequences, it was significant as being a rare contact involving Australian forces in Iraq after the end of major combat operations in 2003. The incident was also the first time that the Australians were directly targeted by anti-Iraqi insurgents. Wright, Lincoln. \\"Diggers Kill Five in Iraq Battle\\", The Sunday Mail, 8 October 2006. Prelude At 09:00 on 26 September 2006 an Australian force consisting of a 60-man element from OBG(W) arrived at the Iraqi Army barracks in Al Rumaythah to conduct a meeting with local stakeholders and to co-ordinate the training of Iraqi police and the reconstruction of the barracks itself. The group comprised infantry from 2RAR mounted in Bushmaster PMVs and cavalry from 2/14 LHR (QMI) mounted in ASLAVs, and was under the command of Major Andrew Stevens. In 2006 Al Rumaythah was a city of 75,000 people and had a reputation for violence and given the threat the Australians deployed snipers in over-watch positions around the barracks, as well as an infantry platoon. Nearby two cavalry ready-reaction groups were on standby. Battle As the meeting commenced small groups of armed men were observed conducting surveillance of the Australian positions. During the next hour insurgents gathered throughout the town and soon after 1100 a rocket- propelled grenade was fired. The insurgents were moving in small groups through the town and appeared to be trying to encircle the barracks in order to conduct a deliberate assault and destroy the Australian force. For the next hour the barracks were attacked with grenades and small arms fire from ranges between to . In response the Australian snipers engaged the insurgents whilst the platoon to the west of the barracks held its ground. Support from USAF F-16s was requested and they were used to fly low and fast over the insurgents in an attempt to distract them. Covered by the infantry Major Steven's party subsequently left the barracks in Bushmasters, still under heavy fire. Although attempting to prevent the Australian withdrawal the insurgents failed to flank the barracks to the north and south and by 12:15 the Australians had successfully broken contact and left Al Rumaythah. During the fighting the Australians used their standard suite of infantry weapons including the F-88 Austeyr and F-89 Minimi LSW, well as MAG-58 MGs and sniper rifles. The ASLAV and Bushmaster vehicles played a crucial role in protecting the soldiers and allowing them to break contact safely. Indirect fires and Close Air Support had been available during the contact, however the decision was made not to escalate the situation due to the proximity of civilians. Following the incident Australian commanders claimed that their soldiers had withdrawn in a disciplined manner and had put themselves at considerable risk to ensure the safety of civilians, whilst applying their fire in a careful and controlled manner.Horner 2008, p. 336. Aftermath The Australians suffered no casualties, while insurgent casualties were difficult to determine. A number of insurgents were observed to have been hit by Australian fire, and at least one source claims that five were killed. Up to 30 insurgents were believed to have been involved in the battle, however their identity‚Äîfor example whether they were Sunnis or Shia religious groups, or al-Qaida‚Äîwas unable to be determined. The balaclava-clad insurgents were dressed mainly in black and armed with AK-47s and grenade launchers. Regardless, they were said to have fought in a well coordinated manner and had used considerable firepower against the Australians. After the battle it was claimed that the insurgents had used civilians as a shield from Australian fire. Despite this there were no reports of civilian casualties after the incident. Two of the Australian infantry section commanders were later awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for co-ordinating a successful fighting withdrawal over of open ground.Wahlert 2015, p. 314.

Biography Bartoshuk grew up in Aberdeen, South Dakota. She received her B.A. from Carleton College and her PhD from Brown University. Her research explores the genetic variations in taste perception and how taste perception affects overall health. Bartoshuk was the first to discover that burning mouth syndrome, a condition predominantly experienced by postmenopausal women, is caused by damage to the taste buds at the front of the tongue and is not a psychosomatic condition. She was employed at Yale University prior to accepting a position at the University of Florida in 2005. Bartoshuk's work at Yale was funded through a series of NIH grants.

He is the head football coach at Southern Methodist University (SMU). Dykes previously served as an offensive analyst for TCU (2017) and as the head football coach at University of California, Berkeley for four seasons (2013‚Äì16) and Louisiana Tech University for three seasons (2010‚Äì12). Dykes began his career as a high school baseball and football coach in Texas, then moved up to the junior college and college level as an assistant football coach, including stints with Kentucky, Texas Tech, and Arizona. In 2010, Dykes became a head college football coach for the first time at Louisiana Tech. After a 5‚Äì7 record in his first season, Dykes led Louisiana Tech to an 8‚Äì5 record in 2011 with a Western Athletic Conference title and followed that with a 9‚Äì3 record in 2012. Dykes then became head coach at California in 2013. After coaching Cal football to its worst season (1‚Äì11) in program history in 2013, Dykes improved to 5‚Äì7 in 2014 and then to an 8‚Äì5 record and Armed Forces Bowl victory in 2015. He finished the 2016 season with 5‚Äì7 record, his third losing season in four years at California, culminating in him being fired in January 2017. In 2017, Dykes was hired as head coach at Southern Methodist University. After achieving a 5-7 record in 2018, Dykes coached the Mustangs to a 10-win season in 2019. This marked the program's most wins in a season since 1984. Early years Son of former Texas Tech head coach Spike Dykes, Sonny Dykes graduated from Coronado High School in Lubbock, Texas where he played both football and baseball. He lettered for three years as a first baseman for the Texas Tech baseball team. Dykes earned a bachelor's degree in history from Texas Tech University in 1993 and a master's degree from the University of Kentucky in 1999. Coaching careerEarly career= Dykes began his career in the spring of 1994 as an assistant baseball coach at Monahans High School in Monahans, Texas. Later in 1994, Dykes switched to coaching football as the running backs coach for J. J. Pearce High School in Richardson, Texas. From 1995 to 1996, Dykes coached at Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas. In 1995, he coached the running backs as Navarro posted an 8‚Äì2 record. In 1996, he served as the quarterbacks and receivers coach and the passing game coordinator as Navarro finished 7‚Äì4 while reaching the Texas junior college championship game. At Navarro, Dykes coached Leroy Fields, who led the nation in receiving and was selected in the seventh- round of the 2000 NFL Draft by the Denver Broncos. In 1998, Dykes served as the wide receivers coach at Northeast Louisiana. Under Dykes' guidance, wide receiver Marty Booker broke all of NLU's single-season and career receiving records and was named first-team All-Independent. Booker played in the Blue- Gray and East-West Shrine all-star games and was selected by the Chicago Bears in the third-round of the 1999 NFL Draft. =Kentucky= In 1997, Dykes served as a graduate assistant and tight ends coach at Kentucky under head coach Hal Mumme. Dykes returned to Kentucky in 1999 to serve on Mumme's staff as wide receivers coach and special teams coordinator. The season highlights were a victory over #20 Arkansas and a trip to the Music City Bowl. At Kentucky, Dykes coached James Whalen who earned consensus All-America honors and set the all-time NCAA Division I record for receptions by a tight end. Whalen was selected in the fifth-round of the 2000 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. Dykes also coached wide receiver Quentin McCord who was selected in the seventh- round of the 2001 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. Two of Dykes' players, Derek Smith and Brad Pyatt, signed as undrafted free agents with the Indianapolis Colts in 2002 and 2003, respectively. =Texas Tech= In 2000, Dykes joined Mike Leach's staff at Texas Tech as the wide receivers coach. Dykes coached wide receiver Carlos Francis who finished his career at Texas Tech with the second-most career touchdowns and third-most career receiving yards, and Francis was selected in the fourth-round of the 2004 NFL Draft by the Oakland Raiders. In addition to Francis, Dykes also coached receivers Wes Welker and Derek Dorris who signed free agent contracts with the San Diego Chargers and New York Giants, respectively. During his tenure as the Texas Tech receivers coach, the Red Raiders participated in a bowl game in each of his five years including the 2000 Galleryfurniture.com Bowl, 2001 Alamo Bowl, 2002 Tangerine Bowl, 2003 Houston Bowl, and 2004 Holiday Bowl. Texas Tech finished the 2004 season ranked 17th in the final Coaches Poll, which was the first time the Red Raiders were ranked in a final poll since joining the Big 12 Conference. After five seasons as the Texas Tech wide receivers coach, Dykes was promoted to co-offensive coordinator alongside Dana Holgorsen in 2005. Texas Tech opened their 2005 season with a 6‚Äì0 record, the program's best start since 1998. In 2005, the Red Raiders were trailing Kansas State, 13‚Äì10, late in the second quarter but won the game 59‚Äì20. Also in 2005, Texas Tech had a halftime lead of 14‚Äì10 over Texas A&M.; By the end of the game, Texas Tech increased the margin to 56‚Äì17. It was the Aggies' worst loss to the Red Raiders in the 64-year-old rivalry. The 2005 season culminated in a trip to the Cotton Bowl Classic and a ranking of 19th in the final Coaches Poll. In Dykes' second season as co-offensive coordinator, Texas Tech ranked third in passing with 370 passing yards per game and sixth in total offense averaging nearly 450 total yards per game throughout the 2006 season. That season Dykes directed an offense that scored 32 points per game, and two receivers ranked top three in the nation in receptions per game and a third receiver ranked in the top twenty. Dykes helped develop Joel Filani into a two-time first team All-Big 12 honoree and a sixth-round selection in the 2007 NFL draft by the Tennessee Titans. In 2006, receiver Jarrett Hicks caught 13 touchdown passes to set the school's single-season record and signed as a free agent with the San Diego Chargers in 2007. In Dykes last game at Texas Tech, he helped orchestrate the biggest comeback in NCAA Division I-A bowl game history in the 2006 Insight Bowl against Minnesota. With Texas Tech trailing 38‚Äì7 in the third quarter, the Red Raiders overcame the 31-point deficit to defeat Minnesota 44‚Äì41 in overtime. =Arizona= Dykes joined Mike Stoops' staff at Arizona as offensive coordinator in 2007. In his first season coaching the Wildcats' offense, Dykes increased Arizona's offensive output by 130 yards per game, and they finished second in the Pac-10 in passing offense with a school- record 308 yards per game. Arizona's pass efficiency rating increased 32 points from 2006 to 2007. In 2007, Arizona set single-season records for passing yards, passing yards per game, completions, touchdown passes and completion percentage, in addition to many single-game records by quarterback Willie Tuitama. During the 2008 season, Dykes helped lead Arizona to eight victories and the programs first winning year since the 1998 season. Arizona earned their first bowl appearance since 1998 and defeated #16 BYU 31‚Äì21 in the 2008 Las Vegas Bowl. In that game, the Wildcats' 31 points were the most in Arizona bowl history. Wide receiver Mike Thomas set the record for the most receptions by any receiver in Pac-10 history. Rob Gronkowski set the school tight end records for single-game, single-season, and career receptions, yards, and touchdowns. Gronkowski was named an Associated Press third-team All-American and All-Pac-10 first-team tight end. During the 2009 season, Dykes helped lead Arizona to their second consecutive eight-win season and a second place Pac-10 finish, the program's highest since 1998. In the final game of the regular season, Arizona defeated #20 USC 21‚Äì17. Arizona finished the regular season ranked #22 in the AP Poll, the Wildcats' first national ranking since the 2000 season. The Wildcats' season culminated with an appearance in the 2009 Holiday Bowl. =Louisiana Tech= On January 20, 2010, Dykes was hired to replace Derek Dooley as the head football coach of Louisiana Tech. In Dykes' first season, LA Tech's record improved to 5‚Äì7 overall and 4‚Äì4 in the WAC. Despite coaching his team to a losing record, LA Tech's offense improved in several areas of the NCAA statistical ranks including passing offense (91st in 2009 to 62nd in 2010) and total offense (66th to 52nd) while the team's average offensive national rank improved from 65th in 2009 to 54th in 2010. Despite a 1‚Äì4 start in 2011, Louisiana Tech rallied to win seven consecutive games to cap off the regular season with the program's first WAC football title since 2001 and an appearance the Poinsettia Bowl. As a result of LA Tech's success, Dykes was honored as the 2011 WAC Coach of the Year. At the conclusion of the 2011 season, Dykes signed a contract extension to increase his base salary to at least $700,000. In 2012, Louisiana Tech finished with a 9‚Äì3 record, the program's best since 1997, but was not invited to a bowl game. Dykes guided the Bulldogs to a 22‚Äì15 record over his 3 seasons as head coach. =California= On December 5, 2012, Dykes was announced as the 33rd head football coach at the University of California, Berkeley. 2013 Shortly after being named Cal's head coach, Dykes stated that the \\"most important hire that I make is hiring a defensive coordinator that will come in and get to work from Day 1 and get a defense established.\\" He further stated that his number one job was to \\"hire the best defensive coordinator I can find in the United States.\\" In one of his first major decisions as head coach, Dykes hired Andy Buh to serve as his defensive coordinator. In Dykes' first season, the California defense surrendered the most passing yards in Division 1 college football history, leading to it becoming the worst defense in the nation. This eventually led to Buh being reassigned to a non-coaching administrative role. The Golden Bears struggled in Dykes' first season, finishing with a 1‚Äì11 record. Dykes' first season marked the first time since Cal began playing football in 1886 that the team failed to defeat a single D-1 FBS opponent in a season that has lasted at least five games. Dykes inherited Jared Goff who was recruited in 2012 by Dykes predecessor Jeff Tedford. Dykes named Jared Goff as the team's starting quarterback, making him the first true freshman quarterback to start a season opener in Cal history. Goff went on to set a new Cal record with 3,508 passing yards and an NCAA record for most completions in a season by a freshman with 330. Cal finished the year losing to arch-rival Stanford by 50 points, the largest margin ever in the 119-year history of the Big Game. 2014 In 2014, California improved to 5‚Äì7, jumping out to a 4‚Äì1 start, before losing six of their final seven games. Cal averaged 38.3 points per game, second-best in the Pac-12 and 11th-best in FBS, generating a program-record 459 total points for the season. However, the Golden Bears surrendered 367.2 passing yards per game and 42 total passing touchdowns, both ranked last out of 128 FBS teams. During a three-game stretch from Week 3 to Week 5, Cal played consecutive high-scoring games that were won or lost in the final seconds. The Bears lost on a Hail Mary pass to Arizona 49‚Äì45, then beat Colorado 59‚Äì56 in double overtime. The following week, Cal allowed an FBS-record 734 passing yards to Washington State quarterback Connor Halliday, but still won 60‚Äì59 when WSU missed a 19-yard field goal with 15 seconds to play. Dykes' defense struggled even worse in 2014 under the coordination of Art Kaufman (Dykes' third defensive coordinator in as many years), surrendering the most yards in the history of college football. 2015 In 2015, the Golden Bears jumped out to a 5‚Äì0 start, their best since 2007. In Week 3, Cal traveled to Austin and defeated the Texas Longhorns 45‚Äì44, marking the program's first-ever victory over Texas. The following week, Cal beat the Washington Huskies 30‚Äì24, Cal's first victory in Seattle since 2005, snapping a six-game losing streak to Washington. Cal then went on to lose five of its next six games, including losses to rivals UCLA (by 16 points), USC (6 points), Oregon (16 points), and a 13-point loss to arch-rival Stanford. But in a 54‚Äì24 win over the last place Oregon State Beavers, Cal tallied a school-record 760 yards and became bowl- eligible for the first time since 2011. With a 48‚Äì46 win over Arizona State on Senior Day, Cal finished the regular season with a 7‚Äì5 record, clinching their first winning season since 2011. Nevertheless, Cal finished the season in the bottom half of the Pac-12 standings for the third time in three years under Dykes. After the 2015 season, Jared Goff decided to forego another year at Cal and was drafted by the Rams. Within 3 years, he led to Rams to the 2019 Super Bowl and made history as the youngest quarterback to start in the Super Bowl.  2016  Shortly after the conclusion of the 2015 season, Dykes stated that he did not anticipate any staff turnover. However, offensive coordinator Tony Franklin resigned from his position at California a few weeks after Dykes made this statement. Franklin left to take up the same position at Middle Tennessee State, citing a desire to move closer to his family in Kentucky. Dykes replaced Franklin with Jake Spavital, who had recently been fired by Texas A&M; University. Spavital served as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2016 before being promoted to interim head coach following Dykes' firing. Dykes finished the season 5‚Äì7, his third losing season in four attempts with the Golden Bears. 2016 marked the first time California beat one of its in-state rivals under Dykes' leadership, defeating a 4‚Äì7 UCLA in Berkeley on November 26. Dykes once again lost to Stanford at home by two touchdowns and USC in Los Angeles by three touchdowns. His team also lost to San Diego State of the Mountain West Conference. Though two teams with a 5‚Äì7 record were selected for bowl berths in 2016, Dykes' California squad was not selected due to its lower Academic Progress Report score. Performance in rivalry games Dykes has only one win against any of Cal's in-state Pac-12 rivals. Altogether, his teams have lost to UCLA, USC, and Stanford 11 times in the four years that he has coached the Golden Bears. Dykes' teams lost to division rival Oregon in his first three outings before beating the Ducks in 2016. Contract extension, interviews, and firing At the conclusion of the 2015 regular season, Dykes was reported to have interviewed for college football coaching positions at Missouri, Virginia, and South Carolina. None of these schools made Dykes an offer to hire him as head coach. Dykes was nevertheless able to negotiate an extension with the University of California. Less than a year after receiving this extension, Dykes interviewed for the head coaching vacancy at Baylor University, but Baylor athletic director Mack Rhoades instead decided to hire Matt Rhule. On January 8, 2017, California fired Dykes. Under contract through the 2019 season, Dykes was owed $5.88 million, 70 percent of his remaining base salary and talent fee. Besides his losing record, California Athletic Director Mike Williams has stated that Dykes had never \\"settled into California, the Bay Area or the Cal experience\\" as reasons for the firing. =SMU= On December 11, 2017, Dykes was hired as head football coach of Southern Methodist University. 2018 In 2018, his first full season as SMU's head coach, Dykes led the Mustangs to a 5-7 season record, including 4-4 in the American Athletic Conference. 2019 In 2019, the SMU season began with six consecutive victories under Dykes. The 6-0 start was capped by a televised night game in Dallas in which the Mustangs defeated Tulsa in a historic comeback victory in 3OT. The team finished with a 10-2 record and an invitation to the Boca Raton Bowl. 2020 In 2020, the mustangs are off to a 4-0 start and the highest ranked team in Texas. Family Dykes is the son of Spike and Sharon Dykes. His father Spike Dykes was the second all-time winningest football coach in Texas Tech history. Spike died April 10, 2017. His mother Sharon died in 2010 after a lengthy battle with Alzheimer's disease. Dykes and his wife Kate have two daughters and a son.

Known as the \\"Kamloops Kid\\", he served as an interpreter and prison camp guard for the Imperial Japanese Army and the Kenpeitai political police.  Early life in Canada  A Nisei (second-generation Japanese-Canadian), Kanao Inouye was born to immigrant parents in Kamloops, British Columbia. His father, Tadashi Inouye, had emigrated to British Columbia from Tokyo, and had been a decorated Canadian soldier during World War I.Brode P, \\"Canada's war criminal Kanao Inouye\\", Esprit de Corps, December 2002. Although his father died in 1926, Inouye at his first trial described his life in Canada as happy. His family nevertheless maintained close ties to Japan, where his grandfather, Chotahara Inouye, was a Member of Parliament in the House of Peers. After he graduated from Vancouver Technical School, Inouye's family urged him to go to Japan to continue his education. He did so in 1938 and was still there when World War II began.Granatstein J, \\"The Last Good War: An Illustrated History of Canada in the Second World War 1939‚Äì1945\\" 2005: Douglas and McIntyre. p. 60. War years In 1942, Inouye was conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army as an interpreter. Made a sergeant, he was assigned to Sham Shui Po prison camp in Hong Kong, which housed Canadian prisoners of war from the Hong Kong Garrison. Inouye was noted for his unusual brutality. He beat prisoners at random, stating it was in retaliation for racism and discrimination that he had received in Canada. In contrast to his later trial testimony about his childhood, he allegedly told them: \\"When I was in Canada I took all kinds of abuse. ... They called me a 'little yellow bastard'. Now where is your so- called superiority, you dirty scum?\\"Greenhous B, \\"'C' Force to Hong Kong: A Canadian Catastrophe 1941‚Äì1945\\" 1997: Dundurn Press. p. 130.Woo T, \\" Responsibility \\" The Fighting 44s: Uniting the Asian Conscience, April 17, 2006. Inouye was discharged from the army the following year, but in 1944 he was conscripted as an interpreter for the notorious Kenpeitai military police in Hong Kong. Trial testimony stated he had been an enthusiastic torturer of suspected spies and traitors. Former POWs would later testify that Inouye was responsible for the torture and death of at least eight Canadian POWs.  Conviction and execution  After the Japanese capitulation in August 1945, Inouye was arrested in Kowloon and tried for war crimes by a military tribunal. He was convicted and was sentenced to death. However, the verdict was overturned on appeal, since as a Canadian citizen, he could not be prosecuted for war crimes committed by an enemy army. In April 1947, Inouye was tried on the criminal charge of treason, was again found guilty and sentenced to death. On August 27, 1947, he was executed by hanging on the gallows at Hong Kong's Stanley Prison.

Landau specializes in language learning, spatial representation and relationships between these foundational systems of human knowledge. She examines questions about how the two systems work together to enhance human cognition and whether one is actually foundational to the other. She is known for her research on unusual cases of development and is a leading authority on language and spatial information in people with Williams syndrome. Education & background Landau received her B.A. in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1970, her Ed.M. in educational psychology from Rutgers University in 1977 and her Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1982. Prior to her current position at Johns Hopkins University, she was a faculty member at Columbia University, the University of California, Irvine, and the University of Delaware. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2009. She was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2018. In addition, she is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Cognitive Science Society, the American Psychological Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Relationship between spatial language and spatial cognition Landau's research focuses on spatial language, spatial cognition, and the way that the two interact with one another. In addressing this relationship, there are several possibilities. It could be that universal spatial representation leads to spatial language, that language shapes our representations, or each plays a role in shaping the other. Landau has examined these concepts in a number of different psychological settings to make sense of these possibilities. One way of looking at the relationship is by examining the interaction between non-linguistic spatial memory and language. One study looked at this relationship by comparing English, Korean and Japanese speakers on several tasks. In tasks where participants had to describe spatial relationships, they used different types of language. For example, English speakers only used contact terms (e.g. touch, sit on) when a reference object was touching the top side of a figure object but Japanese and Korean speakers used contact terms regardless of which side of a figure object the reference object was touching. However, the languages did not differ on every dimension of language use. Axial terms, which refer to either the vertical or horizontal orientation of objects (e.g. left, above), were used consistently across languages. When participants completed tasks where they were asked to view spatial relationships and to hold these in memory, participants were equally adept, regardless of which language they spoke. All participants had the greatest memory for orientations in which objects were in contact with one another or in which objects lay on an axis from one another (e.g. directly horizontally or vertically). Overall, there were distinctions in the use of languages to describe spatial relationships but not in the memory of these spatial relationships themselves. Landau's research implies that the perception of axial structure and of contact/support is foundational to cognition. Because they are such basic, underlying aspects of cognition, they are not impacted by the fact that these perceptions are described differently in different languages. Another aspect of memory related to language that has been studied by Landau and colleagues has been feature conjunctions, which are the way in which people hold in memory multiple features of an object at one time (e.g. shape and color). Generally, this is difficult for people. In studies where squares were divided in half, with one half being one color and the other half being another, people recalled the way in which the squares were divided (e.g. horizontally, vertically or diagonally) but had difficulty recalling which half was which color. Verbal cues given during the memorization period (e.g. saying that red was left of green) improved memory for feature conjunctions but non-lingual cues (e.g. flashing colors) did not. Additionally, only directional language caused memory improvements: just saying that red was touching green was unhelpful. The explanation was that linguistic cues allow people to create hybrid representational schemes: temporary mental representations of the target that incorporate both the directional language and the spatial orientation of the target. These hybrid schemes are much easier to hold in memory than simple spatial representations. Language is also relevant to the differences between spatial representations across species. A number of species in addition to humans are able to represent information spatially. For instance, when they are allowed to orient themselves and are then disoriented, many species, like mice and birds, are able to reorient themselves. Spatial representations are used preferentially, while non-spatial information is ignored, even if it is highly salient or would be relevant to the situation at hand. For example, when remembering a specific corner of a room, the length and shape of walls will be referred to but the color of the walls is often ignored. Evidence has been found that spatial representations occur in a specific area of the brain across species, most likely the hippocampus. Humans differ from other species in spatial representations in that language allows us to hold more stable spatial representations in memory such that they can be shared with others. Language helps to enhance memory of spatial representations but does not dramatically change them. In essence, language makes encoding more efficient, in that people can remember spatial representation in single phrases (e.g. to the right of the blue wall), rather than in mental images of the space itself. It allows humans to create a more unified representation of geometric and non- geometric information than other species. Another area of work surrounding spatial representation and language involves the different ways that people encode objects and places. In general, we have mental representations of the things that we use language for. Landau has done work examining the geometric properties involved in people's representations of object nouns as opposed to spatial prepositions and has found differences in how the two are encoded. For object nouns, people's mental representations include detailed geometric features. These include things like the parts of the object, whether it is hollow or solid, and the orientation of the axes (e.g. the back, front, and sides of the object). For prepositions, people's spatial representations are much less detailed. The only shape information is about the axes and is basically a general ‚Äúsketch‚Äù of the word. The spatial relationships communicated by prepositions also lack detail and consist of simple states (e.g. the objects are in contact, one object contains another) and relative distances. Landau provides two explanations that work in tandem to explain the reasons that objects and places are encoded so differently. The first is the Design of Language Hypothesis, which is about the constraints of language itself. The theory is that language filters down spatial representations into a small amount of information. An infinite number of spatial relations can be encoded in representations but these don't need to be represented precisely by language. For instance, exact sizes or distances are not generally encoded in language, unless in an agreed-upon, scientific system of measurement. The second is the Design of Spatial Representation Hypothesis, which addresses innate human cognition. This hypothesis claims that mental representations are actually different for objects and places due to the fact that different areas of the brain encode ‚Äúwhere‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äù information. These systems must be able to consolidate information together, as humans need to understand what goes where but the information in these two categories is understood separately. Overall, what can be encoded by language is a factor, but a perhaps greater factor (as postulated by Landau) is that the brain is naturally equipped to handle places and objects differently. Landau has also participated in research on the question of the time frame in which language has the potential to modify spatial representations. There are several mechanisms by which this modification can occur. The first, selectivity, is that language only encodes certain aspects of space, not all of them. Because not everything is encoded in language, people are attuned by language to pay attention to certain aspects of a spatial situation and to ignore others. Another mechanism is enrichment, which is the idea that language allows people to combine spatial information with other information in a simple phrase, leading to more stable mental representations. However, these modifications have been found to only occur on a temporary, task-by-task basis, meaning that language can influence human spatial representations but does not permanently change spatial cognition. Overall, Landau's research provides evidence for an interaction between spatial representation and language, in which both play a role in shaping the other. Goals in spatial language Landau has done work on learning how people come to understand paths of motion and of transition and specifically, on the fact that people tend to show a preference for goals in explanations of these paths. Paths can be goal-oriented (moving towards something) or source-oriented (moving away from something). These can be physical paths through motion (e.g. the boy ran from the house to the fence) but can also include transition states (e.g. she sells fruit to the man). In using language to discuss paths, the speaker has to encode an accurate mental representation of the path and then choose which prepositional phrases to use to discuss it. When describing paths that start at one point and end at another, both children and adults regularly include the goal but not the source. This occurred even when people were cued with source verbs (e.g. ran from). Some words inherently have paths (e.g. buy and sell) but even for these words, people would make a statement like, ‚Äúthe girl sold a muffin to the man‚Äù much more often than ‚Äúthe man bought a muffin from the girl.‚Äù Overall, people have a goal path bias when describing events, even when the events are neutral and the verbs used would allow for both options. Further work by Landau and colleagues illuminates the fact that a goal bias developed in infancy, even before the emergence of a full language. Infants are able to perceive the sources of paths and to encode them but only if they are very salient. Therefore, it is not the case that a goal bias exists because infants are incapable of perceiving information of sources. However, when they are shown motion with a salient source and a normal goal, they encode information about the goal preferentially to information about a source. Thus, this bias towards goal paths is not linguistic but exists even before language abilities in humans. There are several possibilities for the origin of this bias. One is that cognition is dependent on moving forwards and on planning ahead, which requires specific attention to the goal. Relatedly, this goal bias may be specific to intentional events, which tend to be about moving towards an endpoint, rather than away from a starting point. Learning object names Landau has done intensive research into the ways in which children learn new words and specifically into the way that spatial information impacts this word learning. One aspect of focus has been on determining which aspects of appearance children value most in learning object names. Research has shown that shape is viewed as more important than size or texture in learning novel object names in both children and adults. For instance, when people learn that a square object is a Dax, they do not view non-squares as Daxes but still consider squares of a different size or texture to be good examples of a Dax. This bias towards shape increases with age. In fact, it has been hypothesized that the bias develops as a way of learning words but begins to be used in general categorization tasks as children develop. Similarly, different spatial information is taken into account when children are learning about different types of words. In one study, a novel word was used as either a noun or a preposition to describe an object being placed in a standard position on top of a box. Then, adults and children were asked to make inferences about whether other objects were examples of the word or not. Object shape and position were treated differently depending on whether people were making inferences about noun or preposition. The precise shape of the object was used to infer whether a noun was the same but the position of the object was irrelevant. For prepositions, the opposite was true: the word was extended to new objects based on the object's orientation relative to the ground object and sometimes based on the object's main axis but not on the shape of the object. People look at different geometric properties when learning nouns and prepositions because they are aware that these categories of words refer to different properties in the world. Landau has also been involved in important work on the influence that in-lab learning has on later learning. In general, learning names for objects means paying attention to the right properties of the object. For instance, the most important feature in calling something a cup is that it is cup-shaped. 17-month-olds were trained on novel object names in a way that cued children to learn that the words were based specifically on the shape of the objects. This in-lab training accelerated children's word learning abilities outside of the laboratory. When children learned in the laboratory that novel names for objects were based on shape, they were cued to pay closer attention to the relationships between shapes and object names in the real world. Not only do children often learn words based on shape but this learning has the potential to shape later learning. These results have the potential to address the Gavagai problem: the question of how children understand exactly what a novel word is referring to. Though prior research has supported the idea that innate constraints in word understanding allow children to do this, Landau's work implies that children may learn what factors to pay attention to through early word learning experience. In general, the research that Landau has been involved in demonstrates that many aspects of word learning depend on paying attention to spatial features. Unusual cases of development In order to understand the normal development of spatial and language abilities, Landau has done extensive research into cases of unusual development: cases where people have some sort of cognitive or visual impairments that might make it more difficult to develop typical spatial or language abilities. The differences between abnormal development and typical development could shed light on how all people gain these abilities. In particular, Landau has done extensive research on Williams syndrome. People with Williams syndrome have severe deficits in spatial understanding combined with a relatively intact language system. Much of Landau's work has focused on determining the underlying cause of this spatial deficit. Williams syndrome is often studied using standardized tasks, such as asking participants to copy models of blocks. People with WS have difficulty with these types of tasks. Work by Landau and colleagues has revealed that this is not due to problems with the executive processes involved in problem- solving (things like correcting for errors) but is instead due to impairments in maintaining spatial representations of the blocks in the model. This work elucidated which specific aspects of spatial representations seemed to be most impaired. Children with WS were just as competent as normally developing children at replicating simple models but were much less accurate when copying more complex models. They understood how patterns were oriented (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) but had problems with determining the arrangement of blocks (e.g. which color blocks went in which locations). These impairments in spatial representations did have some impact on executive processes: when copying complex models, children would often assemble in a semi-random way, instead of checking carefully for errors, as they did with simple models. Their impaired spatial abilities lead them to use a different pattern of problem-solving when faced with a complex model. Work done into the abilities of people with Williams syndrome to track multiple objects at once also reveals spatial deficits. People with Williams syndrome did not demonstrate impaired abilities in tracking multiple, non-moving objects but had a much more difficult time than normal children when objects were moving. Landau and colleagues discovered that this was due to an impaired visual indexing system. Visual indexing is the system that allows people to track multiple objects at one time. There is evidence that normal adults have five (meaning that they can track five objects at once) but people with Williams syndrome appear to have fewer, which means they can track a smaller number of objects. One place where people with Williams syndrome seem to have normal spatial abilities is in the perception of biological motion. Perception of biological motion can be tested using point-light-walkers. These consist of a collection of points of light, which when in motion together, show a human figure walking either left or right. Children with Williams syndrome were just as accurate as normal children at perceiving the motion of these point-light-walkers. Not only does this provide information about spatial cognition in individuals with Williams syndrome, but the ‚Äúselective sparing‚Äù of biological motion perception in these individuals could also suggest that biological motion perception is in a specialized system, which is not impacted by the disorder. Landau has also been involved in work involving spatial understanding in blind individuals and particularly in the way that spatial knowledge develops in blind children. Understanding how blind children gain an understanding of spatial information can provide knowledge about the non-visual aspects of spatial learning. A case study of a child blind from birth showed that when the child was taken on paths between several objects or places, she was able to travel different routes between those objects and places. This means that blind children are still able to make spatial inferences and to find new routes between object pairs. In fact, the child in question performed at the same level as non-blind children who were blindfolded for the experiment, demonstrating that she had the same spatial abilities as children who had the capacity to learn about spatial relationships visually. This evidence contrasted with a previously widespread idea, that blind people were deficient in spatial knowledge. Blind children are able to hold abstract representations of spatial knowledge in mind and have a series of rules about how space exists.

Sediments in bottled wines are relatively rare, and usually signal a fine wine that has already spent some years in the bottle.

Many winemakers therefore take great pains to ensure that the great majority of wines made today (especially those designed to be drunk within their first few years) will remain free of sediment for this time. Wines designed for long bottle aging, on the other hand, frequently deposit crystals of tartrates, and in addition red wines deposit some pigmented tannins.

Its capital is the municipality of Herrera del Duque. The comarca is bordered to the north by the provinces of C√°ceres and Toledo, on the west by Las Vegas Altas comarca, on the south by La Serena comarca, and on the east by the province of Ciudad Real. The district contains 18 municipalities with a combined area of and a population of 29,214 people.Geography of La Siberia (Spanish)La Siberia (Spanish) Municipalities La Siberia contains 18 municipalities: * Herrera del Duque (capital) * Baterno * Casas de Don Pedro * Castilblanco * Esparragosa de Lares * Fuenlabrada de los Montes * Garbayuela * Garlitos * Helechosa de los Montes * Navalvillar de Pela * Puebla de Alcocer * El Risco * Sancti-Spiritus * Siruela * Talarrubias * Tamurejo * Valdecaballeros * Villarta de los Montes History The entrance to Maltravieso Cave La Siberia dates back to prehistory, when inhabitants were hunters and gatherers, semi- nomadic in nature. Rupestrian (made of rock) cave paintings and stone tools have been found from this era. The most prolific paintings in the area (though not in La Siberia itself) are those in the Maltravieso Cave from the Aurignacian era.Microbiological analysis of Maltravieso Cave Human remains and ceramics have also been found in the cave.Maltravieso Cave (Spanish) Geography La Siberia is a land of varying terrain. The foothills of the Montes de Toledo dominate the north, and the flatter Sierra Morena runs through the south. Two major rivers flow through the region, creating vast peneplains in the less mountainous areas. Poor soil as a result of erosion in the peneplains makes the region poorly suited for agriculture, so most of the population relies on livestock as their principal economic activity. The Guadiana River flows the entire length of the comarca from northeast to southwest, going on to form most of the southern portion of the border between Spain and Portugal. The region's inhabitants have created several reservoirs along the Guadiana, providing locals with ample water resources. The largest of the reservoirs are the Cijara, the Garc√≠a de Sola, and the Orellana. Also, in the southern portion of La Siberia flows the Zujar River, which contains two large reservoirs - the Zujar and the La Serena, the latter being the largest in Spain and the second largest in Europe. The combined maximum capacity of these five reservoirs is approximately 6.395√ó109 m3 (2.258√ó1011 cu ft), or about 12% of Spain's water resources; La Serena alone holds 6% of the country's water.Reservoirs of La Serena and La Siberia (Spanish) The region is well known for its abundant water resources; because of all the reservoirs, La Siberia contains the longest inland coastline of any region of Spain and also the largest amount of freshwater in the whole of the Iberian Peninsula.Nature in La Siberia (Spanish) Water Trails in Extremadura (Spanish) =Flora and fauna= With a population density of just under , much lower than Spain's average of , the area's landscape is dominated by a very diverse collection of trees, the most dominant being the oak.Areas of Action (Spanish) Other types of trees include quercus faginea, chestnut, ash, willow, eucalyptus, and pine. Almost all of the region has been declared a Special Protection Area (SPA) for birds because of the large populations of endangered species such as Eurasian black vultures and owls. Large populations of partridges, pigeons, doves, and many other species of birds also inhabit the area. Hunting small game is a common pastime in La Siberia; the most-prized animal being the red-legged partridge. Other small game includes phasianidae, quail, columbidae, rabbits, hares, and foxes. Larger game is also hunted in the region, the most frequent being deer, wild boar, mouflon, and ibexen.Hunting and fishing in La Siberia (Spanish) Fishing is also popular in the comarca. Fish native to the area include common barbel, Iberian nase, tench, and brown trout. Species that have been introduced by locals include carp, black bass, and pumpkinseed.Species of fish in La Siberia (Spanish) =Climate= La Siberia lies between two climate zones - a continental climate to the north and a Mediterranean climate to the south - making this area a transition zone.

It was sponsored by Lever Brothers for Rinso until 1946 when Procter & Gamble became the sponsor. Set in the fictional town of Glen Falls, the program dramatized the life of Ruth Evans who sacrificed her own happiness to care for her younger sister Sue and their crippled brother Neddie. After Sue married reporter Jerry Miller, Ruth continued to care for Neddie. She fell in love with Neddie's doctor, John Wayne, who cured Neddie. Ruth and John married on October 19, 1939, but during World War II, John was held in a Japanese prison camp. He returned to Glen Falls suffering from shell-shock. John was played by Staats Cotsworth, Martin Gabel, and Paul McGrath. The actresses who portrayed Ruth over the decades were Alice Frost, Nancy Marshall, Marjorie Anderson and Mercedes McCambridge. Sue was played by Haila Stoddard, Dorothy McGuire, Peggy Conklin and Fran Carlon. Michael O'Day was heard in the role of little Neddie Evans. In 1940, ZaSu Pitts joined the cast as Mamie Wayne. Over the years the program's writers, in addition to Lauferty, were Julian Funt, Carl Bixby, Bob Newman and Bill Sweets. Announcers for the program were Fred Uttal, Jim Ameche and Hugh Conover. Organist Richard Leibert furnished the background music and the opening theme, \\"Valse Bluette\\". Ameche's son, Jim Ameche, Jr., played Richard, the son of John and Ruth Wayne. In an indication of the program's popularity, listeners sent truckloads of wedding presents to the CBS studio when characters Ruth Evans and Dr. John Wayne were married.

Mayer previously held positions at the Wharton School, the University of Michigan, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Home Mortgage Interest Rate Proposal In October 2008, Mayer introduced a proposal with colleague Glenn Hubbard to ameliorate the effects of the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 by offering home owners the opportunity to refinance their home mortgage at an interest rate of 5.25%. (By December, they had adjusted the proposed rate down to 4.5%.) Mayer and Hubbard argued that the opportunity to refinance household debt at a low rate would improve both household and financial institution balance sheets which would then result in increased investment and consumer spending, mitigating the extent of the financial crisis. The proposal was subsequently debated in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, NPR, and Bloomberg News. On December 12, 2008, Bloomberg News reported that President-Elect Barack Obama's economic team had expressed interest in the plan and White House economic chief Lawrence Summers had attempted to flesh out the details of the plan with Mayer and Hubbard.

The company monitors various websites that host links to downloads of music and film. Web Sheriff has been in operation since 2000, with two offices in the UK. The company was founded by intellectual property lawyer John Giacobbi, who acts as its managing director. Web Sheriff sends legal take-down notice to BitTorrent and other file sharing sites. According to the Los Angeles Times, Web Sheriff is a \\"leading advocate of the soft sell\\" in the anti-piracy industry. Description Web Sheriff performs various copy protection services.Rolling Stone, \\"Battle Over Online Piracy Gets a Sheriff\\", Andy Greene, RS 1077, April 2009 These include protection from copyright infringement, libel, cyber-bullying, identity theft privacy issues of social media, policing of trading sitesEsquire Magazine, UK edition, \\"Meet the Web Sheriff\\", August 2009 and recovery of fraudulently registered domain names. It also furnishes online security for concert tours. Operating methods Web Sheriff uses proprietary software and web crawler programs to search the Internet, using human auditing to determine the type of site that is posting its clients' copyrighted material. It relies heavily on phone calls and relationship building and when locating unauthorized links it targets the persons running the sites. The supposed offending party is sent a take-down notice before further action is taken. Some Torrent sites and file sharing sites such as Mediafire and Rapidshare provide access to the company to remove infringing content itself. The Los Angeles Times described the company's approach as representing \\"a sharp turn in the recording industry's life-and- death struggle with piracy, one driven largely by performers and their managers rather than the record companies.\\" When it contracts to protect new music releases, the company encourages the artists it represents to give fans several tracks ahead of the release. History Web Sheriff was founded in 2000 by former music attorney and industry consultant John Giacobbi. Web Sheriff was hired by Prince in September 2007 to help him \\"disappear entirely from the internet.\\" The star's spokesman related that \\"Prince believes strongly that as an artist the music rights must remain with the artist and thus copyrights should be protected across the board.\\" \\"Very few artists have ever taken this kind of action over their rights.\\" Web Sheriff announced it would launch lawsuits against YouTube, eBay and The Pirate Bay on behalf of Prince if they refused compliance in removing links to his unauthorized photos, videos, and music. Peter Sunde, co-founder of The Pirate Bay, dismissed the threats, stating that American law was not applicable in Sweden. YouTube complied by removing over 2,000 videos from their site and eBay removed more than 300 auctions. In November 2007, three fans sites were given notice to remove all images of the singer, his lyrics and \\"anything linked to Prince's likeness\\". Some of the Prince fans fought back, formed their own organization called \\"Prince Fans United\\" and hired an attorney. Multiple unauthorized overseas online sites selling merchandise featuring Prince were shut down. In 2008 the company was hired by Bryan Adams to take down fan sites and tribute bands as well as the owner of the domain name pointlookout.com that had nothing to do with the artist. The company was hired by Axl Rose to remove an unflattering picture by claiming the copyright belonged to Axl Rose and not the photographer. Reception Music fans and bloggers often initially respond angrily when first approached by Web Sheriff on its clients' official and unofficial forums. According to the Evening Standard, \\"Music blogging sites are littered with comments with the Sheriff's contact details at the top, thanking bloggers for obeying the rules.\\" Fans sometimes interpret this as Web Sheriff saying, \\"I've got my eye on you.\\" The company reports that eventually most of the fans tend to respect the wishes of their favored artists by cooperating. As related by The Guardian, The Prodigy fans on the brainkiller forum engaged with Web Sheriff on a thread that lasted through 18 pages. Some of the fans who had been hostile at the beginning, then asked what they could do to help the band. Web Sheriff's method of using a \\"velvet glove approach\\" to appeal to fans has been said by Randy Lewis with the Los Angeles Times to have notable successes, including Lady Gaga's Born This Way and Adele's 21. This journalist also notes that despite these examples of success of the \\"diplomatic strategy\\", the company's gentle approach still has skeptics, with some critics calling it naive: Brad Buckles, an executive in copyright enforcement with RIAA, was quoted as saying: \\"It's certainly well- intended and may work in some cases. The problem is in many, many cases, you're dealing with people who have no respect whatsoever for the intellectual property of record labels or the artists themselves.\\" A Billboard journalist concludes that to appeal to sites that post links to unauthorized music and engaging with fans and redirecting them to authorized content by the artist is a \\"strategy with a future, if implemented properly.\\"  See also  * Copyfraud ReferencesExternal links *Web Sheriff official website *AMERICANA; John McEuen interviews John Giacobbi - Europe's Web Sheriff Syndicatednews.net - 20 March 2011 Category:Business services companies established in 2000 Category:Online companies of the United Kingdom Category:Copyright enforcement companies Category:Computer security companies Category:Intellectual property organizations ","title":"Web Sheriff"},{"id":"20790402","text":"David Holdridge (born February 5, 1969) is an American former professional baseball pitcher.

Throughout the history of wine, winemakers have attributed successful vintages and ideal weather conditions to the unexplained effects caused by the comets.The New York Times archives (August 13, 1872). The Comet Some of the most heralded vintages in the last couple of centuries-- such as the 1811, 1826, 1839, 1845, 1852, 1858, 1861, 1985, and 1989 vintages --have coincided with a notable appearance of a comet.G. Harding \\"A Wine Miscellany\\" pg 45-47, Clarkson Potter Publishing, New York 2005 There is no scientific basis for any effect of comets on viticulture, but the term nevertheless remains in use. The term \\"comet wine\\" is sometimes used in the wine world to describe a wine of exceptional quality in reference to the high reputation that comet vintages have.Brewer's Dictionary \\"Comet wine\\" Accessed: December 20th, 2008 The 1811 comet vintage, coinciding with the appearance of the Great Comet of 1811, is perhaps the most famous. The 1811 Ch√¢teau d'Yquem has exhibited what wine experts like Robert Parker have described as exceptional longevity with Parker scoring the wine a perfect 100 points when tasted in 1996. The 1811 vintage of Veuve Clicquot is theorized to have been the first truly \\"modern\\" Champagne due to the advancements in the m√©thode champenoise which Veuve Clicquot pioneered through the technique of remuage.Johnson, Hugh (1989) Vintage: The Story of Wine. Simon and Schuster. pp. 337. Effects of the comets There is no accepted viticultural impact of comets on grapevines, and there have been many successful vintages throughout the world in years where there were no noticeable comet sightings. Over centuries a great number of events and phenomena have been attributed to the appearances of comets in the sky--such as devastating earthquakes, a 1668 epidemic among cats in Westphalia, or an increase in the birth of twins in a particular area. While many of the phenomena associated with comets tend to be negative, the association of comets and wine has almost always been held as beneficial by viticulturists and oenologists.The New York Times archives (July 19, 1874). The Spectre of the Skies 1811 vintage Despite officially banning the importation of bottled French wines, such as Champagne, Tsar Alexander I was said to have sought out the Veuve Clicquot Cuv√©e de la Com√®te The 1811 comet vintage has had the most lasting notoriety. The comet that year was the Flaugergues comet, named after Honor√© Flaugergues who first spotted the comet in March. The comet was visible for most of the growing season, which saw optimal conditions for many of the world's major growing regions, but particularly for France. After a string of bad vintages at the start of the 19th century, the 1811 vintage was a reversal of fortune in regions like Bordeaux, Cognac, Champagne and Sauternes. For Cognac, the vintage was considered one of the greatest in history, with many producers today including images of stars on their labels as an homage to the 1811 vintage. Notable wines from this include the 1811 Ch√¢teau d'Yquem, which received a perfect 100-point wine rating by wine critic Robert Parker at a 1996 tasting over one hundred and eighty years after it was bottled. In Germany, the 1811 vintage was so successful that producers along the Rhine would label their wines as \\"comet hock\\". The 1811 bottling of vintage Champagne from the Champagne house of Veuve Clicquot has been theorized to have been the first truly \\"modern\\" Champagne. The wine was one of the first to be described as \\"limpid\\" or sediment-free. This was due to the new technique of remuage or riddling developed by Veuve Cliquot that tackled the historical problem of how to remove the ill tasting and unpleasant looking sediments from the sparkling wine without losing the carbon-dioxide gas that makes it bubble. The development of riddling was a hallmark moment in the evolution of the modern Champagne industry. In the early 19th century, Veuve Clicquot tried to keep their techniques a secret, but the clarity and limpidity of their Champagne captured worldwide attention and eventually their secret escaped.Johnson, Hugh (1989) Vintage: The Story of Wine. Simon and Schuster. pp. 330-341\\\\. In the summer of 1812, following Napoleon's invasion of Russia, despite a decree from Tsar Alexander I of Russia banning the importation of French wine in bottles, Louis Bohne, lead sales agent for Veuve Clicquot, was able to smuggle a large quantity of the 1811 Cuv√©e de la Com√®te into K√∂nigsberg. As word of the wine's quality spread, Bohne found eager customers among the Russian elite,Don and Petie Kladstrup, Champagne: How the World‚Äôs Most Glamorous Wine Triumphed Over War and Hard Times (New York: William Morrow, 2005), p. 83-84 . with even the Tsar himself seeking out the wine. =Literary references= There have been several references in literature to the 1811 vintage, which was often described as the \\"Year of the Comet\\". Ernst J√ºnger's 1939 novel On the Marble Cliffs has central characters drinking wine from the \\"year of the comet\\". In \\"The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk\\" by Arthur Conan Doyle, Dr. Watson describes Sherlock Holmes, upon being told the clerk's story, as being pleased, \\"like a connoisseur who has just taken his first sip of a comet vintage.\\" In the 1992 romantic comedy Year of the Comet, a bottle of 1811 Ch√¢teau Lafite is central to the story line.Van Gelder, Lawrence, The New York Times, (June 21, 1991). At the Movies: Wine as Hero Other notable comet vintages During its 1986 return Halley's Comet was visible in late 1985 which has been called a \\"comet vintage\\" The 1858 comet vintage attributed to the Donati Comet was widely praised for the quality of Bordeaux claret that came out of that vintage. The 1874 comet vintage was considered especially favorable for the German wine regions of the Mosel and Rheingau.The New York Times archives (August 27, 1874).

He and his brother, Thomas Lobb, were the first collectors to be sent out by the Veitch nursery business, with the primary commercial aim of obtaining new species and large quantities of seed. His introductions of the monkey-puzzle tree, Wellingtonia and many other conifers to Europe earned him the sobriquet \\"messenger of the big tree\\". In addition to his arboreal introductions, he also introduced many garden shrubs and greenhouse plants to Victorian Europe, including Desfontainia spinosa and Berberis darwinii, which are still grown today. Early life Lobb was born in 1809 at Lane End, Washaway near Bodmin Cornwall and offline Taxon, Vol. 41, No. 3 (Aug., 1992), pp. 471-475. and spent his early life at Egloshayle, near Wadebridge. He had four brothers and two sisters. Two of the brothers, Henry and James, became managers of gunpowder plants in south-west England. His father, John Lobb, was the estate carpenter at nearby Pencarrow where a notable garden had been developed by Sir William Molesworth. John developed a love of gardening and, after losing his place at Pencarrow, he took up employment at Carclew House, near Falmouth, the home of Sir Charles Lemon. Sir Charles would later be amongst the first people in England to receive and grow rhododendron seed from Sir Joseph Hooker, who had sent seed directly to Sir Charles from his Himalayan expedition of 1848‚Äì1850. William, along with his younger brother Thomas, worked in the stove-houses at Carclew where Sir Charles encouraged the Lobb boys in their study of horticulture and botany. In 1837, William was engaged by Mr Stephen Davey of Redruth, where he helped establish a \\"thoroughly efficient\\" horticultural establishment. From there, he moved on to become gardener to the Williams family at Scorrier House, near Falmouth. He gained a reputation as a keen amateur botanist and assembled a fine collection of dried specimens of British plants, particularly Cornish ferns, but had an increasing desire to travel abroad and to discover unknown \\"vegetation\\". By the late 1830s, James Veitch had established his plant nursery at Mount Radford, Exeter and was looking for ways to extend the range of plants on offer, thus improving the profitability of the business. After correspondence with the eminent botanist Sir William Hooker about the most suitable destination, Veitch decided to employ his own plant hunter to gather exotic plants from South America exclusively for his nursery. William's brother Thomas had been employed by Veitch since 1830 and recommended William to Veitch. Veitch was impressed by William's keen manner and horticultural knowledge; according to the account in Hortus Veitchii, William: > was quick of observation, ready in resources, and practical in their > application; he had devoted much of his leisure to the study of botany, in > which considerable proficiency had been acquired. Veitch decided that William, despite not being a trained botanist, would prove a steady, industrious and dependable collector. He therefore booked him a passage on HM Packet Seagull, which was to set sail from Falmouth on 7 November 1840, bound for Rio de Janeiro and Lobb thus became the first of a long line of plant collectors to be sent out by the Veitch family to all corners of the world. James Veitch was anxious to ensure that Lobb should not be \\"cramped for funds\\" and arranged for an annual allowance of ¬£400 to be made available to draw on in the large cities along his planned itinerary. Before his departure, Lobb visited Kew Gardens where he was taught how to make herbarium specimens by placing plant material between special papers. South America (1840‚Äì1844)Brazil and Argentina= Lobb took with him seeds of the early Rhododendron hybrid \\"Cornish Early Red\\" (R. arboreum x R. ponticum) as a gift from Veitch to the new emperor of Brazil, Pedro II. The seeds were planted in the gardens of the Imperial Palace at Petr√≥polis where they are still growing today. Following his arrival at Rio de Janeiro, Lobb spent 1841 exploring the Serra dos √ìrg√£os (Organ Mountains) to the north-east of the port where he discovered several orchids including the swan orchid, Cycnoches pentadactylon, as well as Begonia coccinea and Passiflora actinia. His first shipment of discoveries, which arrived at Topsham dock in March 1841, also included a new species of Alstroemeria, an Oncidium, O. curtum (with yellow flowers and cinnamon-brown markings), and a new red Salvia. There were also several species of the beautiful pink-flowered climber Mandevilla, including M. splendens, which would become highly sought after for cultivation in England, and the small shrub Hindsia violacea, with its clusters of ultramarine flowers, which quickly became popular in Victorian greenhouses. The next shipment arrived at Topsham in May but had been delayed at Rio de Janeiro and, as a result, many of the plants failed to survive the journey, arriving dead or \\"vegetated\\". Later in 1841, Lobb travelled by boat to Argentina, where he spent the winter exploring the area around Buenos Aires. In January 1842, he sent back five cases of plants, seeds and dried specimens, but unfortunately the ship was unable to dock at Exeter as expected and continued on to Leith in Scotland, from where the packages eventually reached Exeter. Lobb then travelled overland to Chile via Mendoza and the Uspallata Pass over the Andes, thus avoiding the perilous sea voyage around Cape Horn. Lobb found the journey through the mountains gruelling, having to travel through snow that he described as \\"five feet deep, frozen so hard that the mules made no impression and the cold was intense\\", causing him to collapse ill with fever on several occasions. =Chile= Desfontainia spinosa James Veitch's instructions to Lobb included a request to locate and bring back seeds of the Chile pine (more popularly known as the monkey-puzzle tree) (Araucaria araucana) which had originally been introduced to Britain by Archibald Menzies in 1795. Veitch had seen a young specimen at Kew Gardens grown from seed brought back by the Horticultural Society's collector James McRae in 1826, and was convinced that this tree would be hugely popular as an ornamental plant. Once Lobb had recovered from the ordeal of his Andean crossing he left Valpara√≠so and travelled south by steamship to Concepci√≥n from where he set off to the forests of the Araucan√≠a Region. At 5,250 feet, he reached his destination where the sought-after Araucaria araucana was growing on the exposed ridges below the snow-capped volcanic peaks of the southern Andes. Lobb collected over 3,000 seeds by shooting cones from the trees while his porters gathered fallen nuts from the ground. Lobb then returned to Valpara√≠so with the sacks containing the seeds and personally saw them onto a ship bound for England. The shipment arrived safely at Exeter and by 1843 Veitch was offering seedlings for sale at ¬£10 per 100. Unknown to his employers, Lobb also sent seeds back to his former employers, Sir Charles Lemon at Carclew and John Williams of Scorrier House, where a plantation of monkey-puzzle trees was grown. During 1842, Lobb collected from the Valpara√≠so area and sent back seeds of a purple nasturtium climber, Tropaeolum azureum, which he located at \\"Cuesta Dormeda, about sixteen leagues (50 miles) from Valpara√≠so\\". He also sent the pale-blue mallow, Abutilon vitifolium, and the white, rosemary‚Äìscented Calceolaria alba, which was the forerunner of many Calceolarias which were to become popular as summer bedding plants. Lobb then travelled by steamship to Talcahuano and then to Los √Ångeles, from where he went inland towards the mountains following the Laja River upstream to the Antuco volcano. He then followed the Andes to Santa B√°rbara regularly making excursions up to the snow line. Lobb found this expedition exhausting and the eventual shipment back to England was disappointing with only one significant new discovery, a magenta flowering perennial Calandrinia umbellata. Lobb's travels then continued through northern Chile, where he discovered Desfontainia spinosa, before moving on through Peru to Ecuador. =Peru, Ecuador and Panama= En route, he collected the passion flower, Passiflora mollissima (now P. tripartita var. mollissima), which became popular in greenhouses, and the delicate Calceolaria amplexicaulis. In the spring of 1843, he took four cases of plants, which he had collected on the slopes of the Peruvian Andes, by sea to the Ecuadorian port of Guayaquil. While he was there, an epidemic of yellow fever broke out and, along with other European residents, he was forced to move to Pun√° Island until the epidemic was over, leaving his cases with a shipping agent to send to England. On leaving Pun√°, Lobb hired mules and a guide and travelled inland to Quito and on into southwestern Colombia. He eventually reached the port of Tumaco, with a further collection of plants, from where he sailed for Panama intending to travel on with his latest finds back to England. On arriving at Panama City however, he received news from James Veitch that the cases of plants left in Guayaquil had never arrived. Lobb therefore despatched his latest collection from Panama (which arrived safely at Exeter) and awaited instructions from Veitch. Amongst the shipments from Panama were several orchids including Oncidium ampliatum collected near Panama City, described by Veitch in a letter to Hooker as arriving \\"quite fresh but others are rotten\\", a blue-azure Clitoria and a Lobelia, Centropogon coccineus, which he found growing \\"in shady places on the banks of the Chagres River\\" as well as seeds of several Fuchsias and Tropaeolum. While waiting in Panama, Lobb continued to seek out new plants despite suffering from an attack of dysentery. Once he had recovered, he returned to Guayaquil where he discovered all his cases rotting in a corner of a warehouse, with much of the contents destroyed by ants. The agent explained that the cases had \\"quite escaped his notice\\". Lobb was able to rescue some of the seeds, bulbs and dried specimens which he sent to Exeter. Veitch replied by sending back a supply of glass to make new shipping cases and insisting that Lobb endeavour to replace everything that was lost. Despite being exhausted from his travels and repeated attacks of ill health, Lobb returned to the interior of Peru for a further four months, finally arriving back in England in May 1844. On Lobb's return to Exeter, Veitch wrote to Hooker: > I was disappointed at hearing William Lobb had left Peru, but pleased to > hear of his safe arrival in England with many plants and seeds in good > order. He reached Exeter with his plants on Saturday and is now gone to his > friends. Amongst the dried samples sent back to England was one of Solanum lobbianum which was sent to Kew Gardens where it was labelled as \\"Lobb Columbia\\". It was named after its discoverer by Georg Bitter (1873‚Äì1927), the German expert on Solanum, based on the single specimen at Kew. For a long time there was some doubt about the actual location of the plant's discovery until it was re- discovered in Ecuador by an American expedition in the 1990s. =Gunpowder ingredients= It has been suggested that it was William Lobb who in 1844 brought the knowledge that gunpowder could be made with sodium nitrate from Peru to Cornwall, in England. Until then, gunpowder in Britain and the rest of Europe had been made only with potassium nitrate. On his travels Lobb would undoubtedly have met and talked to his fellow Cornishmen living in Peru/Chile and employed by the mines. There were significant numbers there. Lobb was familiar with the use and manufacture of gunpowder for mining, having grown up near the two gunpowder plants at Ponsanooth, Cornwall. Also, as a professional gardener, he would have known about sodium nitrate, which was widely used as a fertilizer in Britain at that time. The 1841 census shows that while William was in South America, his brother, Henry Lobb, was living at Cosawes Woods (a local gunpowder plant) where he worked as a labourer. Another brother, James Lobb, lived at nearby Perranwharf. He worked as a cooper. Within two years of William's return, two additional plants had been built in Devon/Cornwall to make blasting powder. These were at Herodsfoot, Cornwall and at Powdermills on Dartmoor. Sodium nitrate was suitable for blasting powder, which was used in the mines and quarries of the region. The sodium nitrate as received from Peru was of sufficient purity to be used without further treatment. This accounts for the absence at these two plants of the usual facilities for upgrading the potassium nitrate that came from India, which had a purity of only 65-70%. The manufacturing know-how probably came from the Perran Foundry. Barclay Fox, the owner of the Perran Foundry, certainly had some commercial interest in the second plant and a connection through the Quakers to the owners of the first. The 1851 census shows that fortune smiled on the Lobb family in the years after 1846. Henry Lobb became the manager of the Herodsfoot plant and had a 1/6 share in the venture. His brother-in-law and former neighbour, James Martin, became the manager of Dartmoor Powdermills; James Lobb was appointed its agent and, by 1861, its manager. Was some sort of deal struck? Because of his background as a 'local', William Lobb would have had access to the right people at Perran Foundry, giving him the opportunity to pass on his valuable information about Peruvian gunpowder. The advancement of his brothers could have been William Lobb's reward. South America (1845‚Äì1848) Crinodendron hookerianum After a period of rest and recuperation, Lobb returned to work in the Exeter glasshouses planting out and nurturing his introductions. By April 1845, his health had fully recovered and he was again despatched to South America with instructions to collect hardy and half-hardy trees and shrubs. After sending home from Rio Janeiro a consignment of plants collected in southern Brazil, he travelled by sea to Valpara√≠so in Chile from where he initially visited the montane forests of the Colombian Andes before visiting the extreme south of Chile from the shores of Tierra del Fuego to the southern coastal islands. From the Valdivian temperate rain forests of Chile, Lobb brought back the Chilean firebush (Embothrium coccineum), the Chilean bellflower (Lapageria rosea) (the national flower of Chile), the flame nasturtium (Tropaeolum speciosum) and the Chilean lantern tree (Crinodendron hookerianum). He also collected seeds of three species of myrtle tree, Luma apiculata, Ugni molinae and Luma chequen as well as \\"four most interesting Conifers for this country ... that South America produces\\" ‚Äì the Guaitecas cypress (Pilgerodendron uviferum), the Patagonian cypress (Fitzroya cupressoides), Prince Albert's yew (Saxegothaea conspicua) and Podocarpus nubigenus as well as seeds of the hardy Antarctic beech (Nothofagus antarctica) and several other shrubs including Escallonia macrantha. Berberis darwinii From a visit to Chilo√© Island, Lobb introduced Berberis darwinii which had been discovered in 1835 by Charles Darwin during the voyage of HMS Beagle. According to the Gardeners' Chronicle: > If Messrs. Veitch had done nothing else towards beautifying our gardens, the > introduction of this single species would be enough to earn the gratitude of > the whole gardening world. Lobb's finds were despatched to England where they were grown in Veitch's Exeter nursery before being sold to eager gardeners. Many of his discoveries have endured and remain popular garden shrubs today. One glasshouse at the Exeter nursery was reserved exclusively for William Lobb's discoveries, where James Veitch would tend the new plants and identify those that would become a commercial success and those that would be merely of botanical interest. Amongst the plants sent back by Lobb were two species of Cantua which he found growing in Bolivia, Chile and the Peruvian Andes; C. buxifolia (the magic- flower) which was the first to flower in May 1848 and the bushy C. bicolor, with its large golden-red trumpet flowers. There were also other species of nasturtium, including Tropaeolum umbellatum from Ecuador, with its orange- tipped red flowers, and what was thought to be an unknown species which was named Tropaeolum lobbianum by Hooker after its discoverer, although this was later found to be a synonym for T. peltophorum previously discovered by Karl Theodor Hartweg. At the beginning of 1848, William Lobb arrived back in England and was re-united with his brother Thomas for the first time since setting off for Brazil in November 1840. Thomas in the meantime had also been despatched by Veitch to collect plants in Malaysia and Indonesia and had returned a few months earlier. North America (1849‚Äì1853) In 1849, Veitch decided to send William Lobb to collect in the cooler climate of North America in order to find conifers and hardy shrubs in Oregon, Nevada and California, \\"with a view of obtaining seeds of all the most important kinds known, and, if possible, discover others.\\" Lobb reached San Francisco in the summer of 1849, at the height of the California Gold Rush; when he arrived the harbour was choked with hundreds of ships, abandoned by their crews who had joined the hopeful prospectors afflicted with \\"gold fever\\". Lobb soon left the lawless port and set off in search of \\"horticultural gold\\" in Southern California. He spent the autumn of 1849 through to early 1851 in the Monterey area, including the Santa Lucia Mountains, where he soon found the striking Santa Lucia fir (Abies bracteata), later described by Hooker as \\"among the most remarkable of all true pines\\". The cones sent back by Lobb were full of seed which were capable of being propagated by Veitch. In 1849, he visited Cone Peak, in Los Padres National Forest where he collected a new species of lupin, Lupinus cervinus (deer lupine) which he sold to the California Academy of Sciences. In 1862, Dr Albert Kellogg recognized this as a taxon hitherto unknown to science. Kellogg noted that this was \\"a very marked [distinct], fine [attractive], robust species, worthy of cultivation\\". Thuja plicata In the Monterey area Lobb also found Rhododendron occidentale, one of only two deciduous Rhododendron species native to western North America which was to become the parent of many hybrid rhododendrons, and a small horse chestnut, the California buckeye (Aesculus californica). He also sent back seeds of various other conifers, including the Monterey pine (Pinus radiata), the bishop pine (P. muricata), the gray pine (P. sabiniana), the Coulter pine (P. coulteri), and the knobcone pine (P. attenuata); and also of many shrubs and flowering plants, most quite new to British gardens. In the autumn of 1851, he moved north collecting large quantities of seed from the sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and the western white pine (Pinus monticola); he also collected sackfuls of seed from the world's tallest tree, the California redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), which had been first introduced by Patrick Matthew to Britain in 1853. The following year, he moved further north into the regions explored by David Douglas in the 1820s, including the mountains of Oregon and the Columbia River. On this expedition he collected seeds of the noble fir (Abies procera) and the Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) as well as three conifers that had been overlooked by Douglas, the Colorado white fir (Abies concolor), the red fir (Abies magnifica) and the western red cedar (Thuja plicata). On his way back to San Francisco at the end of 1852, he collected seed from the grand fir (Abies grandis) and the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and another new discovery, the California juniper (Juniperus californica). Lobb was the first collector to gather seed in bulk from trees that were still rare in England; the amount of viable seed he sent to Exeter enabled Veitch & Sons to grow thousands of seedling trees. As well as the large number of conifers, Lobb discovered various shrubs including the red Delphinium cardinale, the yellow Fremontodendron californicum, a flowering currant Ribes lobbii (named after him) and a collection of Ceanothus including two natural hybrids, C. √ó lobbianus and C. √ó veitchianus which he found on the dry slopes and ridges of the high Californian chaparral. =Wellingtonia= In 1853, Lobb was in San Francisco packing his collection of seeds to prepare them for shipment back to England when he received an invitation to a meeting of the newly formed California Academy of Science. At the meeting, Dr Albert Kellogg (the academy's founder and a keen amateur botanist) introduced a hunter named Augustus T. Dowd who had brought to him a story of a \\"Big Tree\\". Dowd told the audience that in the spring of 1852 he was employed as a hunter by the Union Water Company, of Murphy's Camp, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Calaveras County, to supply the workmen, who were engaged in the construction of a canal, with fresh meat. He had been out chasing a large grizzly bear; the long, hard chase led Dowd into a strange part of the forested hills where he followed the bear into a grove of gigantic trees. Dowd soon lost interest in the chase and wandered around in amazement at the sheer size of the trees surrounding him. On returning to his camp, Dowd told his story to his companions, most of whom did not believe him and accused him of being drunk; a week later, however, he was able to persuade some of the less sceptical to be led to the grove, where they were equally astonished by the monstrous trees. Biddulph Grange Wellingtonia Walk Lobb immediately realised the impact such a tree would have on British gardens and the importance that his employers would attach to being the first nursery to offer it for sale. After the meeting, he quickly headed to Calaveras Grove where he had the good luck to find a recently fallen tree, which he measured as \\"about 300 feet in length, 29 feet 2 inches, at 5 feet above the ground...\\". In his notebooks, Lobb recorded: \\"From 80 to 90 trees exist all within circuit of a mile, from 250ft. to 320ft. in height, 10‚Äì12ft. in diameter.\\" He collected as many seeds, cones, vegetative shoots and seedlings as he could carry back to San Francisco, including two small living trees. He then returned to England on the first available boat arriving back in Exeter on 15 December 1853, a year earlier than expected. Lobb had taken a gamble cutting short his contract, knowing that, at the risk of angering his employer, he had to get the seeds to England before anyone else could get back first. The gamble paid off as Veitch was delighted, abandoning all other projects to concentrate on raising the seedlings in commercial quantities. According to Hortus Veitchii, the two sapling trees \\"survived but three or four years, nor was there at any time much hope of their living.\\" On Christmas Eve 1853, an editorial in The Gardeners' Chronicle announced that Veitch & Son \\"had received branches and cones of a remarkable tree from their collector in California, William Lobb\\" who had described it as \\"the monarch of the Californian forest\\". James Veitch had immediately given specimens of the giant tree to John Lindley, professor of botany at the University of London and invited him to name the tree. In the Gardeners' Chronicle article, Lindley named the species Wellingtonia gigantea as a memorial to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington who had died in September the previous year. The \\"giant amongst trees\\" was considered an appropriate memorial for such an important British historical figure. Six months later, the Chronicle reported that Veitch was offering seedlings of the tree at 2 guineas each or 12 guineas a dozen. Lobb could not claim to be first to introduce the tree to Britain, as a Scot, John Matthew, had taken some seed to Scotland four months earlier although he only distributed the seed among a few friends. The Victorians fell in love with the tree in much the same way as they had with the monkey-puzzle tree a few years earlier, using it as a specimen tree and often planting it to form avenues, including James Bateman who planted an avenue at Biddulph Grange, alternating Wellingtonia with monkey-puzzle trees. There is a good example of the tree in the garden of the manager's house at the gunpowder plant in Herodsfoot, Cornwall, where William's brother, Henry Lobb, lived for many years. Unfortunately, the name Wellingtonia gigantea was invalid under the botanical code as the name Wellingtonia had already been used earlier for another unrelated plant (Wellingtonia arnottiana in the family Sabiaceae). Eventually in 1939, after several attempts to find an acceptable name, the tree was given the name Sequoiadendron giganteum by John Buchholz. In Britain, however, the tree remains known popularly as \\"Wellingtonia\\". Later career and death By the middle of 1854, James Veitch and his son, James Veitch, Jr. (who had acquired premises in Kings Road, Chelsea, London in 1853), decided that it was time for William and his brother, Thomas, to be sent off again to collect fresh seed and search for yet more new plants. Thomas was sent back to the far East, to Java and North Borneo in search of Nepenthes pitcher plants. William had been suffering from persistent ill-health for some time ‚Äì James Veitch remarked that there was \\"a sort of restlessness about him\\" ‚Äì and was exhibiting the symptoms of syphilis, probably contracted in the ports of South America. In a letter to Sir William Hooker, James Veitch noticed: > He seems taken with a sort of monomania, which it is difficult to describe > and which he could not explain himself, a sort of excitability and want of > confidence. Despite his concerns, in the autumn of 1854, Veitch sent Lobb back to California on another three‚Äìyear contract. Lobb was unable to make any further new discoveries, but sent back consignments of plants and seeds from time to time until the end of 1856. In January 1857, Veitch wrote to Hooker: \\"We hear Lobb has been ill, his writing appears shaky and I am inclined to think it is probable he will soon return.\\" Thomas and William Lobb botanist memorial garden plaque pictures Devoran Churchyard, Cornwall In the event, Lobb did not return to England and after the expiry of his contract in 1858 he remained in California. He sent back a small number of seeds to private collectors and to the Low nursery at Clapton, including a new variety of white fir (Abies concolor subsp. lowiana) (popularly known as \\"Low's white fir\\" after them) and the rare Torrey pine (Pinus torreyana). James Veitch complained to Lobb that he still had obligations to fulfill but Lobb was undeterred and caused Veitch further embarrassment by sending herbarium specimens and live plants direct to Sir William Hooker at Kew Gardens. Communications from Lobb gradually ceased, to the alarm of both his family and Veitch, who wrote to Hooker: \\"We thought he had given up collecting plants, for Californian gold.\\" His last communication to his family was in 1860. On 3 May 1864, Lobb died forgotten and alone at St Mary's Hospital in San Francisco. The cause of death was recorded as \\"paralysis\\", but was probably as a result of syphilis. He had no mourners at his burial (on 5 May) in a public plot in Lone Mountain cemetery. In 1927, his headstone was moved to South Ridge Lawn and in 1940 to a crypt at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park under the care of the California Academy of Sciences. A small memorial plaque can be found in Devoran church, Cornwall where his brother Thomas Lobb was buried in 1894. Obituary In Hortus Veitchii, the history of the Veitch family, Lobb's contribution to modern gardening is described thus: > The singular success which rewarded his researches is, perhaps, unparalleled > in the history of botanical discovery; the labours of David Douglas not even > forming an exception. In her history of the Veitch family, Seeds of Fortune ‚Äì A Gardening Dynasty, Sue Shephard adds: > William was arguably one of the finest but least‚Äìknown of collectors who > gave gardeners some of the most remarkable trees and loveliest plants ever > grown.

They competed in the NRL's 2009 Telstra Premiership, finishing the regular season 2nd (out of 16), a vast improvement on the previous season, when they came last. The Bulldogs came within one match of the grand final but were knocked out by the Parramatta Eels.  Season summary  After an extremely disappointing 2008 season, in which the club finished with the wooden spoon, 2009 will be a season of rebuilding for the Bulldogs. A number of high-profile new recruits, including Brett Kimmorley, Josh Morris, Michael Ennis, David Stagg and Ben Hannant along with mid-season signing of Greg Eastwood will join the club.  Fixtures  During the regular season, the Bulldogs will play most home games at ANZ Stadium in Homebush. ANZ Stadium is also the home ground of the South Sydney Rabbitohs, and one of the home grounds of the Parramatta Eels, so Bulldogs away matches against these two teams will also be played at this venue. Two Bulldogs home games will be played away from Homebush: the Round 11 match against Melbourne will be played at Bluetongue Stadium in Gosford, and the Round 19 match against the Gold Coast will be played at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. = Trial Matches = \\\\---- \\\\---- = Regular season = \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- = Finals Series = \\\\---- \\\\---- Ladder2009 squad See also * List of Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs seasons ReferencesExternal links *Bulldogs: Season Review - NRL.com Category:Canterbury- Bankstown Bulldogs seasons Bulldogs RLFC season ","title":"2009 Bulldogs RLFC season"},{"id":"20790587","text":"The International Association of Libraries and Museums of the Performing Arts (, abbreviated SIBMAS), promotes practical and theoretical research in the documentation of performing arts.

He is particularly remembered for his religious works later rendered as hymns and carols. He is also considered one of the most original Polish writers of the early partitions. In his native Poland he was cherished during the Polish Romantic Period of the early 19th century.  Life  Karpi≈Ñski was born in 1741 in Ho≈Çosk√≥w (Holoskiv) near Kolomyia and educated at Stanis≈Çaw√≥w (then the territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, now Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine). He attended university in Lwow, obtaining the title of Doctor of Philosophy. He spent a further eighteen months in Vienna, where he studied foreign languages. His first employment was as tutor in the magnate courts. In 1780, his first volume of poetry came to the attention of the powerful Czartoryski family. Under their patronage, he travelled to Warsaw to become secretary to Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. He wrote three books of poetry, which saw great popularity, but after a few years he became disillusioned by the hypocrisy prevalent in the capital, and retired back to the Polish Kresy (Eastern Borderlands) countryside, by then under the Austrian partition. Between 1785 and 1818 he worked as a tutor to the Branicki family in Bia≈Çystok. There he wrote some of his most famous works, including \\"B√≥g siƒô rodzi, moc truchleje\\" (\\"God is Born, Power Trembles\\") and \\"Kiedy ranne wstajƒÖ zorze\\" (\\"When the Morning Lights Arise\\"). It was primarily those religious and patriotic songs, hymns and carols that would be sung by later generations and immortalize his works in Poland. In 1800 he became a member of the newly formed Society of Friends of Science. Several of his poems make romantic references to one \\"Justina\\"; for this he was known as \\"Justina's lover\\" during his lifetime. Some speculate he nicknamed all of his loves Justina, and that he referred to at least three different women by this name. In 1818, he retired to a manor near Wo≈Çkowysk (now Vawkavysk in Belarus), where he wrote his memoirs. He died on 16 September 1825.

Rugby union career Ward Prentice and four of his brothers played first grade rugby union in Sydney at various times and two others played in the lower grades. Ward and two of his brothers later played first grade rugby league. Ward's club career started with his local Western Suburbs RUFC and he made his representative debut in 1908 for New South Wales against a touring Anglo-Welsh side. In 1908 he was selected in the 31-man squad for the 1908‚Äì09 Australia rugby union tour of the British Isles and France. Chris McKivat was the standout incumbent five-eighth even though McKivat had greater career success at half-back. The selectors generally opted for Fred Wood, the tour vice-captain at half, with McKivat at fly-half. Prentice made a handful of tour match appearances at centre and at five-eighth and the Howell reference quotes Pollard \\"he distinguished himself by his unselfish team play and clever-cross-kicking for his loose forwards and wingers.....and was an astute cover-defender who on numerous occasions saved certain tries by launching himself at opposition wingers when they were set to score\\".Howell p48 In the tour match before the first Test Prentice scored the try of the match stepping through the whole team before touching down in the corner Prentice made his Test debut against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park on 12 December 1908 at five- eighth and paired with McKivat. He set up the Wallabies' first try scored by Tom Richards though Australia lost the Test 6‚Äì9. Prentice had to leave the field twice for treatment after being kicked in the mouth and his injury caused him to miss the next five tour matches. In January he earned his second cap in the Test against England. He played at centre in the 9‚Äì3 win. By the end of the tour which also took in Canada and the US, Prentice had played in 13 of the 35 matches. In 1910 he represented for Australia in three internationals against New Zealand. His representative career highlight came in 1912 when he was selected as touring captain of the Wallabies squad for the 1912 Australia rugby union tour of Canada and the USA.Australian Rugby Team (Touring America), 1912, The Daily Telegraph, (Wednesday, 18 September 1912), p.15. The tour was a disappointment with the squad billeted out in college fraternity houses where the hospitality played havoc with team discipline and as result the team lost against two California University sides and three Canadian provincial sides. They rose to the occasion for the sole Test of the tour against the United States where Prentice earned his final cap and kicked a penalty goal to score his only international career points. All told Ward Prentice played for Australia on thirty-two occasions including six Tests, one as captain. 1908 Wallaby tour squad Cricket career His first-class cricket debut came in 1913 when he kept wicket for Victor Trumper's New South Wales side, against Queensland at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Although he fell for a duck in his only innings, he took the catches of both Queensland opening batsmen. Prentice had to wait until 1921 for his second and final first-class appearance when he captained New South Wales against the same opponents and on the same ground. Again playing as a wicket-keeper, Prentice made another duck and didn't take a catch. Rugby league career In 1920, Prentice joined his brother Clarrie a Western Suburbs rugby league stalwart who played 115 games with the club in a war-interrupted career over nine years. Ward played five first grade games for the Magpies in the New South Wales Rugby League in season 1920. Their older brother Archie had also played for the club (27 games) in 1915‚Äì16.

The Quays Dublin. 2016. The Dublin quays () refers to the two roadways and quays that run along the north and south banks of the River Liffey in Dublin, Ireland. The stretches of the two continuous streets have several different names. However, all but three of the names (Swift's Row, Bachelors Walk and Usher's Island) share the same \\"Quay\\" designation. The quays have played an important part in Dublin's history. Much of the southern roadway and about half of the northern roadway is part of the R148 road while the other half of the northern roadway is part of the R801 road. Routes description A view upstream from Grattan Bridge, towards the Four Courts (the domed building), with Essex Quay and Wood Quay on the right bank (left of picture) and Upper Ormond Quay on the left bank (right of picture) Both roadways run approximately 4.3 km (2.7 mi) from Sean Heuston Bridge in the west. The eastern end of the north roadway is at East-Link Bridge while the south roadway turns southward at the Grand Canal. Seventeen bridges cross the river along the line of The Quays; three of them are exclusively pedestrian bridges, one a railway bridge, one other for Luas trams (with another planned) and pedestrians, and the remainder for vehicular and pedestrian use. The name designations of the north roadway are (from west to east): Wolfe Tone Quay, Sarsfield Quay, Ellis Quay, Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Upper Ormond Quay, Lower Ormond Quay, Bachelors Walk, Eden Quay, Custom House Quay and North Wall Quay. The name designations of the south roadway are (from west to east): Victoria Quay,Christopher Moriarty ‚Äì Exploring Dublin: Wildlife, Parks, Waterways ‚Äì 2002 Page 44 \\"The outer face of the wall of Victoria Quay is something of a flower garden, even with an aspiration towards woodland. One little alder grows amongst the stonework and there are occasional sycamores. Red valerian, scentless mayweed, ...\\" Usher's Island, Usher's Quay, Merchant's Quay, Wood Quay, Essex Quay, Wellington Quay, Crampton Quay, Aston Quay, Burgh Quay, George's Quay, City Quay, Sir John Rogerson's Quay and Britain Quay. A majority of the roadways in the city centre are one-way with the north roadway being eastward and the south being westward. History A map of Dublin Quays in 1797 Vikings were among the first settlers in Dublin and many Viking artifacts were found at what is now Wood Quay. The quays were first developed during the time of King John in the early 13th century when the monarch licensed citizens to erect buildings on the River Liffey. They became the center of the Irish shipping trade until the 1800s when the river in this section was considered too shallow for the more modern heavy ships. The southern fa√ßade of The Custom House on Custom House QuayThe Custom House, one of Dublin's major landmarks on Custom House Quay, was completed in 1791. The quay takes its namesake from the building. Later, the Four Courts on Inns Quay was completed in 1802 and is currently home to the Supreme Court of Ireland and the High Court. Both were designed by noted architect James Gandon. Burgh Quay is named after Elizabeth Burgh, wife of Anthony Foster whose son was Rt. Hon. John Foster, last speaker of the Irish House of Commons. Burgh Quay was once the site of the Tivoli Theatre. The Corn Exchange Building, designed by George Halpin in 1815, was approved by the Wide Streets Commission in 1816 and work commenced on this building soon afterward. Its granite facade still remains on Burgh Quay. Shipping came as far upstream as Burgh Quay until 1879 when Butt Bridge was constructed. A number of the buildings on Burgh Quay (including number 8) still retain remnants of the shopfronts designed for the Wide Streets commissioners. The 20th century saw much development to the quays. One controversial development was at Wood Quay by the Dublin Corporation in the late 1970s, when there were many archeological Viking finds. This led to a very public and unsuccessful campaign to halt the development. Announced in 1998 and with the first phase opened in late 2000, the Liffey Boardwalk is a series of pedestrian walkways which were developed along the quays in the early 21st century. In 2006, local politicians proposed renaming some of the quays. MEP Gay Mitchell proposed renaming George's Quay or Victoria Quay to Joyce Quay or Behan Quay, for the Irish writers James Joyce and Brendan Behan. Dublin quays in culture A number of artists have found inspiration from the quays. In 1898, author Frances A. Gerard described the Dublin quays as follows: \\"Much of the picturesque appearance of Dublin is due to the Quays which intersect the City and the Bridges which span the Liffey; they impart to it a foreign air resembling the Quays of Paris.\\" Irish novelist James Joyce had many of his story lines take place at the Dublin quays, including Eveline (1904) and An Encounter (1914). Joyce biographer Michael H. Begnal wrote, \\"Joyce associated the Liffey Quays with the desire for escape.\\" Artist Jack Butler Yeats painted Dublin Quays in 1916. The 1987 film The Dead, adapted from Joyce's story, was filmed by John Huston at Usher's Island. In Joyce's story The Dead, the sisters Kate and Julia Morkan host their annual dance at their \\"dark gaunt house on Usher's Island.\\" 'Ushers Island' was the name of a competitor in the 1994 Grand National at Aintree, falling at the third fence. In 2015, folk musician Andy Irvine launched a band called 'Usher's Island' (a reference to the Dublin quay), with members D√≥nal Lunny, Paddy Glackin, Michael McGoldrick, and John Doyle.Celtic Connections: Usher's Island at Old Fruitmarket, Glasgow, heraldscotland.com, 28 January 2015; retrieved 18 March 2017. Bachelors Walk was a comedy-drama aired on RT√â during March 2001, following the lives of three bachelors who lived on the titular quay. Rudyard Kipling began his poem \\"Belts\\" with the lines: \\"There was a row in Silver Street, that's near to Dublin Quay/Between an Irish regiment an' English cavalree.\\" Notable buildings on the Dublin quays *The Custom House (Custom House Quay) *Four Courts (Inns Quay) *Central Bank of Ireland (North Wall Quay) *Dublin City Council Civic Offices (Wood Quay) *Liberty Hall (Eden Quay) *Convention Centre Dublin (North Wall Quay) *3Arena (North Wall Quay), previously the Point Depot and the O2 *Church of the Immaculate Conception (\\"Adam and Eve's\\", Merchant's Quay) *Clarence Hotel (Wellington Quay) References Category:Dublin Docklands Category:Quays in Dublin (city) ","title":"Dublin quays"},{"id":"20790768","text":"Marina Smilets (, before 1292 ‚Äì 7 April 1355) was the eldest daughter of tsar Smilets of Bulgaria and his Byzantine wife, tentatively called Smiltsena Palaiologina. Family The date and the place of Marina's birth are unknown, but she was born before her father's ascension on the Bulgarian throne in 1292, maybe in his official residence in Kran. Her mother was the daughter of sebastocrator Constantine Palaiologos and niece of Michael VIII Palaiologos. In the histories she was called just Smiltsena (Bulgarian: –°–º–∏–ª—Ü–µ–Ω–∞; the wife of Smilets), without a name being given. Marina was the elder sister of tsar Ivan II of Bulgaria and Theodora, queen-consort of Serbia. Marina Smilets was maternal aunt of King - and later, Emperor - Stefan Uro≈° IV Du≈°an of Serbia. Despotissa of Kran Tsar Smilets died in 1298 and Ivan II of Bulgaria succeeded him as emperor in Tarnovo. The new tsar was a child, and the government was in the hands of the widowed empress Smiltsena. Marina's mother apparently defeated Smilets' brothers Radoslav and Voysil, who sought refuge in the Byzantine Empire and entered into Byzantine service. To meet this threat and the invasion of the Mongol prince Chaka, Smiltsena sought an alliance with Aldimir (Eltimir), the brother of the former ruler George Terter I. Aldimir was accordingly married to Marina and, if this had not happened earlier, was given the title of despotƒìs and invested with an extensive landholding around Kran. As his wife, Marina was granted the title of despotissa of Kran. Despina Marina gave birth to a son, called Ivan Dragushin. The regents of Ivan II were unable to strengthen their position, and abandoned Tarnovo to Chaka, who installed himself as emperor in 1299. Smiltsena and Ivan II settled in the possessions of Aldimir and Marina, where they may have remained until the accession of Aldimir's nephew Theodore Svetoslav to the throne in 1300. Aldimir entered into an alliance with Theodore Svetoslav and his own possessions around Kran were enlarged. As result Aldemir maybe asked Marina's family to leave Kran and they fled to Constantinople. Exile In 1305 Aldemir appears to have entered into negotiations with the Byzantines, and Theodore annexed his uncle's lands. Marina may have had a strong influence over the policy of her husband and, after Aldimir's subjugation by the Tsar, she and Ivan Dragushin fled to Constantinople. After 1321, Marina and her son relocated to the Kingdom of Serbia, where the power was seized by King Stefan Deƒçanski, who was married to Marina's sister Theodora. Marina was treated with high respect by Deƒçanski and his son, Stefan Du≈°an, who was her nephew. In Serbia, Marina and her son were land in Polog. Later she retired to a monastery under the monastic name Maria. Marina was portrayed along with a boy, –∞ grandson of her, in the church of Kavadarci in Polo≈°ko Monastery. Marina Smilets survived her son and died on 7 April 1355\\\\. She was buried in Skopie.  References Sources * Pavlov, Plamen, \\"–¢—ä—Ä–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Ü–∞—Ä–∏—Ü–∏\\". –î–ê–†-–†–•, 2006.

Morgan Family Haze Morgan (1876-1952), a lawyer in the Clarksburg area, was a member of the Morgan family, that has a substantial historic associations with western Virginia and West Virginia. Haze Morgan practiced law with John W. Davis, the only West Virginian ever nominated by a political party for President of the United States (but who lost to Calvin Coolidge). Haze Morgan had two famous great uncles: Colonel Morgan Morgan, first known white settler in what became West Virginia and who built a cabin near Bunker Hill in 1724 (a monument concerning which Haze Morgan was responsible), and General Zackquill Morgan, who founded Morgantown in 1766. Zackquill's grandson, Francis Harrison Pierpont, who represents West Virginia in the National Statuary Hall Collection, became an abolitionist after a tour of Mississippi before the American Civil War but unsuccessfully opposed Virginia's secession. An avid supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, he served as governor of the Virginia counties that broke away to become West Virginia, and later as the Reconstruction Era governor of Virginia. Architecture Architect Stephen Warder Ford designed the home per a commission from Haze Morgan, who wanted it as a residence. It was completed in 1914.

The five parts, or parties, were premier, haut-contre, taille, quinte, and basse, equivalent to violin, alto viola, tenor viola, low-tenor viola, and cello. History Les Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi were founded in 1626 under Louis XIII. As part of the Musique de la Chambre they played in the musical accompaniment to festivities and official events at the Versailles court. Within five years, by 1631, the British royal court of Charles I had copied the structure (‚Äútreble violins,‚Äù ‚Äúcontratenor violins,‚Äù ‚Äútenor violins,‚Äù ‚Äúlow- tenor violins‚Äù and ‚Äúbass violins,‚Äù to use the terms applied in London at the time), but with a total of fourteen instruments (3, 2, 3, 2, and 4). In the 1670s, Charles II, who lived at Versailles during the British Interregnum, exactly matched the forces of Les Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi, as he had experienced them as Louis XIV‚Äôs guest, showing the influence by place and time of the French formation. Meanwhile at Versailles, the Vingt-quatre Violons were combined when needed with the wind instruments of the Grande √âcurie, the royal stables, which were used for hunting, war, and celebratory open-air occasions. This combination became in fact the world‚Äôs first true orchestra, as that term is understood in Western art music. It would be used later in the pit of the Op√©ra Royal at Versailles under Lully‚Äôs direction. Each member of the Vingt-quatre Violons had to have an impeccable reputation and had to be Roman Catholic. Their privileges included tax exemption and the right to carry a rapier. Among the members were Lully, Jean-F√©ry Rebel, his son Fran√ßois Rebel, and Jacques Aubert. In 1656, under Louis XIV, the membership was augmented by a group of 16, later 21, string players called La Petite Bande. The Vingt-quatre Violons were then dubbed La Grande Bande. In 1761 the Vingt- quatre Violons was disbanded for financial reasons and merged with the Chapelle Royale, then responsible for religious festivities. Instrumentation The five-part instrumentation of the Vingt-quatre Violons consisted of the following string instruments: * 6 premiers violons (first violins, tuning: g ‚Äì d1 ‚Äì a1 ‚Äì e2) * 4 hautes-contre (tuning: c ‚Äì g ‚Äì d1 ‚Äì a1) * 4 tailles (tuning: c ‚Äì g ‚Äì d1 ‚Äì a1) * 4 quintes (tuning: c ‚Äì g ‚Äì d1 ‚Äì a1) * 6 basses de violon (tuning: ‚ÄöB flat ‚Äì F ‚Äì c ‚Äì g) The three middle parts were played by violas of identical tuning, but different sizes (body lengths 37.5 cm, 45 cm and 52.5 cm), resulting in different timbres and volumes. The basses de violon, i.e. the Baroque cello, were tuned a whole step lower than today's cello and were slightly larger. The group could be augmented by the violones doubling the basses de violon. Sometimes a bass viol could be substituted for a basse de violon. The Petite Bande also included several viol players. The instrumentation of the Vingt-quatre Violons drove the five-part string writing that prevailed in 17th- and 18th-century France, especially the early-18th- century orchestral symphonies of Jean-F√©ry Rebel.

Meanwhile, 36 soldiers of the 10th Parachute Regiment were captured and held by the LTTE. Lt. Gen. A.S. Kalkat assigned the task of freeing them to Kumar. Kumar took with him 50 kg ammunition and some biscuits and sailed up the river. Kumar saved the soldiers (who had been held in the forest for 72 hours), destroyed an important ammunition depot, and killed 39 militants. Kargil war Kargil in Jammu and Kashmir Major Vivek Gupta, of the 2nd Battalion of the Rajputana Rifles and his company were given the task of recapturing Point 4590 on Tololing Hill in the Dras sector. The objective was to capture the enemy post, located at high altitude (15,000 feet). Kumar commanded the Light Machine Gun Group during his company's assault. Besides Kumar, the commando team included Major Vivek Gupta, Subedar Bhanwar Lal Bhakar, Subedar Surendra Singh Rathor, Lance Naik Jasvir Singh, Naik Surendra, Naik Chaman Singh Tewatia, Lans Naik Bachchan Singh, CMH Jashvir Singh, and Havaldar Sultan Singh Narwar. The Pakistani army had made 11 bunkers on the Tololing hilltop. Kumar was to target the first and the last bunkers. The other commandos were to target the remaining 9 bunkers. On 13 June 1999, while nearing its objective, the Assault Group came under enemy fire and took casualties. Subedar Bhanwar Lal Bhakar, Lance Naik Jasvir Singh, Naik Surendra, and Naik Chaman Singh were all killed. Major Vivek Gupta himself was killed by a bullet wound to the head. Although Kumar was hit by a bullet in his left arm, he kept firing on the enemy with his light machine gun. His fire facilitated his men's advancement, allowing them to physically assault the enemy position and clear the area after a hand-to-hand fight. He was responsible for killing 48 Pakistani soldiers single-handedly and received total 18 bullets on his body armour.Naik Digendra Kumar (2883178A) Medals and awardsMahavir Chakra= The nation's second-highest wartime gallantry award, the Mahavir Chakra, was awarded to Kumar on 15 August 1999, for daring actions and service to his country during the Kargil War, specifically by occupying Tololing Hill. =Other awards= Kumar was awarded the Sena Medal in 1993 for his anti-terrorist operations in the Kupwara area of Jammu-Kashmir. In 1994 his services were appreciated for recapturing the Hazratbal Shrine from terrorists. In popular culture The 2003 Bollywood war film LOC Kargil is based on the Kargil War. It was written and directed by J. P. Dutta. Actor Avtar Gill played the role of Digendra Kumar.

In the speech, Nixon announced the end of the U.S. offensive biological weapons program and reaffirmed a no-first-use policy for chemical weapons. The statement excluded toxins, herbicides and riot-control agents as they were not chemical and biological weapons, though herbicides and toxins were both later banned. The decision to ban biological weapons was influenced by a number of domestic and international issues. Push for a U.S. ban Melvin Laird played a key role in the build-up to a U.S. ban on biological weapons When Richard Nixon selected Melvin Laird as his Secretary of Defense in early 1969, Laird directed the Department of Defense to undertake a comprehensive review of U.S. biological warfare (BW) programs.Mangold, Tom. Plague Wars: The Terrifying Reality of Biological Warfare. Macmillan, 1999, pp. 54-57, (). Laird's push for a review of both the chemical and biological programs arose when Congress attempted to push the Pentagon for open, joint Congressional hearings on chemical-biological warfare (CBW). The Pentagon balked and the result was Laird's memorandum to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger urging a review of those weapons programs. Laird's memorandum to Kissinger expresses fear that the United States will be under \\"increasing fire\\" for the program and calls for the National Security Council to initiate a study. Memorandum sent from Laird to Kissinger Laird hoped to eliminate the U.S. BW program. He saw two reasons to kill the BW program. The first was political--eliminating the program could deflect growing protests over Vietnam. The second was budgetary: As a U.S. Representative, Laird had watched Pentagon BW budgets balloon during the Kennedy and Johnson years. With Laird's impetus, and the concurrence of the National Security Council staff, in late May 1969 Kissinger directed key administration officials to begin a review of CBW \\"policies, programs and operational concepts\\" with a report to be issued no later than September. Surprisingly, Laird found the Joint Chiefs of Staff receptive to BW elimination as well. In twice weekly meetings with the Joint Chiefs during 1969 Laird found none of the officers opposed to ending the U.S. BW program. They found the weapons ineffective and militarily useless, especially when compared to the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The Joint Chiefs made two demands, one was to continue defensive germ warfare research and the other was that they be allowed to maintain the U.S. chemical arsenal as a deterrent to the Soviet Union. In June 1969 Kissinger asked a former Harvard colleague, Matthew Meselson to prepare a position paper on U.S. chemical and biological weapons programs. Meselson and Paul Doty then organized a private conference to discuss policy issues. The result was a September 1969 paper that not only urged U.S. ratification of the Geneva Protocol but an end to U.S. BW programs. Meselson and his colleagues argued that a biological attack would likely inflict a great toll on civilian populations while remaining largely militarily ineffective. Executive action on BW was followed by congressional action on chemical warfare (CW). In August 1969 the Senate passed an amendment to the Military Procurement Bill which unilaterally renounced first-use of chemical weapons. The Senate action also issued a moratorium on the acquisition of new chemical weapons as well as de-emphasizing the need for CW readiness. The bill passed 91-0, although some senators expressed reservations about the CW provisions. Statement Nixon delivered his statement from Fort Detrick, home of the One-Million-Liter Test Sphere, used for testing static aerosols of biological agent, pictured here in 1968 Nixon issued his \\"Statement on Chemical and Biological Defense Policies and Programs\\" on November 25, 1969 in a speech from Fort Detrick. The same day he gave a speech from the Roosevelt Room at the White House further outlining his earlier statement.Nixon, Richard. \\"Remarks Announcing Decisions on Chemical and Biological Defense Policies and Programs\\", via The American Presidency Project, November 25, 1969, accessed December 21, 2008. The statement ended, unconditionally, all U.S. offensive biological weapons programs. Nixon noted that biological weapons were unreliableGraham, Thomas. Disarmament Sketches: Three Decades of Arms Control and International Law, (Google Books), University of Washington Press, 2002, pp. 26-30, (). and stated:Miller, pp. 61-64. > The United States shall renounce the use of lethal biological agents and > weapons, and all other methods of biological warfare. The United States will > confine its biological research to defensive measures such as immunization > and safety measures. In his speech Nixon called his move \\"unprecedented\\"; and it was in fact the first review of the U.S. BW program since 1954. Despite the lack of review, the BW program had increased in cost and size since 1961; when Nixon ended the program the budget was $300 million annually.Cirincione, Joseph, et al. Deadly Arsenals: Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Threats, (Google Books), Carnegie Endowment, 2005, p. 212, (). Nixon's statement confined all biological weapons research to defensive-only and ordered the destruction of the existing U.S. biological arsenal.Mauroni, Albert J. America's Struggle with Chemical- Biological Weapons, (Google Books), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, p. 49-60, (). The Nixon statement also addressed the topics of chemical warfare and U.S. ratification of the Geneva Protocol, which, at the time, the nation had yet to ratify. On chemical warfare Nixon reaffirmed no-first-use of chemical weapons by the United States. He also announced that the United States would reconsider ratification of the Geneva Protocol, which Nixon recommended to the Senate that year.Quester, George H. Before and After the Cold War: Using Past Forecasts to Predict the Future, (Google Books), Taylor & Francis, 2002, p. 161, (). Omissions The presidential statement purposely omitted certain agents, while others were simply overlooked. In an exception to the no-first-use policy, which his statement reaffirmed, Nixon made a deference for riot-control agents and herbicides. Both were in use in Vietnam and both had been lightning rods for criticism.Mauroni, Al. \\"The US Army Chemical Corps: Past, Present, and Future \\", Army Historical Foundation. Retrieved December 21, 2008. Nixon promised later memorandums concerning abolition of both types of agents; herbicide use in Vietnam was discontinued in 1970 but riot-control agent use continued. The other major omission from Nixon's statement were toxins. His statement did not specifically address toxins, such as ricin, which tend to blur the line between chemical and biological weapons. As debate within the Army raged over whether toxins were considered chemical or biological weapons concerning the president's order, work on them continued at Fort Detrick, the \\"hub\\" of U.S. biological weapons programs. For several months following the November order, the Army continued working on staphylococcus enterotoxin type B (SEB). On February 20, 1970 Nixon added toxins, regardless of their means of production - be it chemical or biological, to the U.S. ban on biological weapons. Results and legacy Stockpiled wheat stem rust (pictured) and other anti-crop agents were destroyed in 1973 as a result of Nixon's statement The statement immediately led to National Security Decision Memorandum 35 from Nixon, which was also dated November 25, 1969. The memorandum also stated that the U.S. government renounced all \\"lethal methods\\" and \\"all other methods\\" of biological warfare, it also stated that the U.S. would only conduct BW research and development for defensive purposes. U.S. biological weapons stocks were destroyed over the next few years. A $12 million disposal plan was undertaken at Pine Bluff Arsenal, where all U.S. anti-personnel biological agents were stored. That plan was completed in May 1972 and included decontamination of facilities at Pine Bluff. Other agents, including anti-crop agents such as wheat stem rust, were stored at Beale Air Force Base and Rocky Mountain Arsenal. These anti- crop agents, along with agents at Fort Detrick used for research purposes were destroyed in March 1973. Nixon closed his statement, \\"Mankind already carries in its own hands too many of the seeds of its own destruction. By the examples we set today, we hope to contribute to an atmosphere of peace and understanding between nations and among men.\\" Shortly after Nixon's statement the United States and the Soviet Union began the SALT arms control talks, which eventually resulted in nuclear arms controls as well as the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.Guillemin, pp. 122-27. The U.S. commitment to end BW programs helped provide the lead for ongoing talks led by the United Kingdom in Geneva. The Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee was discussing a British draft of a biological weapons treaty which the United Nations General Assembly approved in 1968 and that NATO supported. These arms control talks would eventually lead to the Biological Weapons Convention, an international treaty outlawing biological warfare.Carter, April, (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute). Success and Failure in Arms Control Negotiations, (Google Books), Oxford University Press, 1989, p. 298, (). Nixon's renunciation is often overlooked in discussions about his presidency and his presidential legacy. Books about Nixon devote little space to the act and those centered on the topic of arms-control, even less. The abandonment of an entire class of weapons remains unrepeated in U.S. history. In addition, Melvin Laird's role in the elimination of offensive U.S. biological capabilities has been largely overlooked. The official U.S. Army history of the U.S. biological warfare program, which spans from the early Cold War to 1969 and includes an overview of biowarfare research, Fort Derick contracts between U.S. universities and the private industry, as well as testing on human volunteers, was published online by the National Security Archives. Nixon's motivation Scholars and critics have argued that Nixon's decision to ban biological weapons was purely politically motivated. This move was seen as a way to placate national, Congressional, and international concerns. It was also seen as a way to progress arms-control talks, additionally it could have stymied the outcry over the use of non-lethal chemical agents in Vietnam. In reality, the issue was much more complex than even those reasons suggest. Meselson and others had argued that biological weapons amounted to little more than a cheap version of a nuclear weapon, and were easily attainable. Biological weapons represented a significant threat in the hands of less-well- armed, poorer nations, and Nixon surely recognized this \\"asymmetrical\\" threat. The administration eventually came to the conclusion that any biological threat could be easily countered with the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Dead sheep resulting from the Skull Valley sheep kill Nixon recognized that the BW program was unpopular and decided that there was no real reason to continue these programs. While there were some political considerations involved in Nixon's decision, the end result brought the topic into international forums for years following his declaration.Croddy, Eric at al. Chemical and Biological Warfare: A Comprehensive Survey for the Concerned Citizen, (Google Books), Springer, 2002, p. 238, (). The media characterized Nixon's decision as a sudden awareness of the horrific nature of chemical-biological warfare. Nixon hoped that the move would bolster both the image of his administration and the United States as a whole.Croddy, Eric and Wirtz, James J. Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History, (Google Books), ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 45, (). He also wanted to score points with the Democratic majority in Congress and he had chosen to do this through various arms control measures. Nixon knew Democrats could not afford to oppose his renunciation of BW programs in light of rising opposition to the use of non-lethal chemicals in Vietnam and other events such as the Skull Valley sheep kill in Utah. Thus, the idealistic language Nixon used in his November statement was only part of the story. Besides the issue of proliferation raised by Meselson, the specter of growing dissent over Vietnam loomed large, as did the fact that the U.S. had never ratified the Geneva Protocol.Schram, Martin. Avoiding Armageddon: Our Future, Our Choice: Companion to the PBS Series from Ted Turner Documentaries, (Google Books), Basic Books, 2003, p. 178, (). In the end, Nixon was motivated to ban biological weapons in the United States by a host of issues.

Tuscany's modern history The Grand Duchy of Tuscany was an independent Italian state from 1569 to 1859, but was occupied by France from 1808 to 1814. The Duchy comprised most of the present area of Tuscany, and its capital was Florence. In December 1859, the Grand Duchy officially ceased to exist, being joined to the Duchies of Modena and Parma to form the United Provinces of Central Italy, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia a few months later in March 1860. In 1862 it became part of Italy. Pre stamp letters Tuscany's mail service may be traced to private letter services operating between 1300 and 1400. In 1704, Gian Gastone de' Medici issued a decree converting the postal service to a state operation and regulating the posting, transport and delivery of letters in detail. The original service ran only between Florence, Pisa and Livorno.Vollmeier p. 13. Prior to the introduction of postage stamps in 1851, letters typically were sent postage due, with various postal markings added to the letter. Postal markings were originally hand written on the letters, and in about 1767, postal markings began to be added by rubber stamp, indicating the town of origin. In 1839, postal markings were introduced indicating the date the letter was mailed.Vollmeier, pp. 13-14. Tuscany's pre-stamp letters and postal markings have received extensive philatelic study. The primary study of them is Paolo Vollmeier's I Bolli Postali Toscani del Periodo Prefilatelico fino al 1851, Florence, 1974. Postal treaties On December 31, 1838, Tuscany signed a postal agreement with the Kingdom of Sardinia and on April 8, 1839, it signed a similar agreement with Austria. These agreements regulated postal rates and procedures for transporting mail between the countries.Vollmeier, p. 15. Another postal convention between Tuscany and Austria was signed on December 1850, which addressed the exchange of mail between the countries and contemplated the introduction of adhesive stamps.Mackay, p. 131.Westoby, pp. 415-416. Postal conventions with Sardinia and France were entered into in 1851.Westoby, p. 417. Tuscany's adhesive stampsIl Marzocco= 4 crazie stamp from 1851 On April 1, 1851, Tuscany issued its first adhesive postage stamps. The stamps depict a crowned lion resting a paw on a shield with the fleur-de-lis. The image is based on the Renaissance sculpture by Donatello of a lion called the Marzocco which was originally commissioned for Pope Martin V and moved in 1812 to the Piazza della Signoria in Florence where it became a symbol of Florentine liberties.Estelle M. Hurll, Tuscan Sculpture of the Fifteenth Century, New York, 1902, pp. 91-93. The stamps shared a common design, differing only in color and denomination. The stamps were initially issued in denominations of 1 and 2 soldi, and 2, 4 and 6 crazie. In July 1851, 1 and 9 crazie stamps were issued and in 1852, Tuscany introduced a 1 quattrino for mailing newspapers and a 60 crazie stamp for international use. The Tuscan lira was divided into 12 crazie, or 20 soldi or 60 quattrini.Scott Stamp Catalogue, \\"Tuscany\\" (Preceding Italy). These stamps were printed by typography by F. Cambiagi at the Grand Ducal Printing Office in Florence. The stamps were engraved by Giuseppe Niderost from which electrotypes were prepared by M. Alessandri of Florence. The stamps were imperforate and were printed in sheets of 240 subjects divided into three panes of 80 stamps each.Vaccari, pp. 160-161. The paper was lightly toned blue or gray and was watermarked with rows of the Crown of Tuscany between parallel lines. Between 1857 and 1859, the stamps, other than the 2 soldi and 60 crazie values, were reissued in the same or similar colors, but printed on white paper with a watermark with intersecting curved lozenges and the words \\"II E RR POSTE TOSCANE\\".Mackay, p. 132. These, like the prior issue, were typographed, imperforate and printed in sheets of 240 subjects divided into three panes of 80 stamps each. =Arms of Savoy= 3 lire stamp from 1860, Italy's most valuable stamp Grand Duke Leopold II abdicated on July 21, 1859, and was succeeded by his son, Ferdinand IV, who was deposed after 27 days. Tuscany briefly became part of the United Provinces of Central Italy, a short-lived client state of the Kingdom of Piedmont- Sardinia, which resulted in Sardinian currency being introduced in which one lira was divided into 100 centesimi. On 7 November 1859, the United Provinces elected Eugenio Emanuele di Savoia-Carignano as their regent. A new series of provisional stamps was issued on January 1, 1860, using the same border, but the lion was replaced with the arms of the House of Savoy. Like the prior two issues, these stamps were typographed, imperforate and printed in sheets of 240 subjects divided into three panes of 80 stamps each.Vaccari, p. 163. In March 1860, Tuscany was annexed to Sardinia, after which Tuscany used the stamps of Sardinia, and in 1862, Italy. Tuscany's postage stamps are among the most highly prized and collected classic stamps and have been extensively studied by philatelists. The primary study on them is F. Bargagli Petrucci's I Bolli Postali Toscani del Periodo Filatelico dal 1851 (1976). The three lire stamp of the 1860 issue in mint condition is the most valuable Italian stamp. Forgeries Fournier forgery of 60 crazie stamp from 1852 Lowell Ragatz, The Fournier Album of Philatelic Forgeries', 1970, p. 143 Tuscany's postage stamps have been forged numerous times for the philatelic market. Fernand Serrane stated in 1927 that \\"a small book would be needed to describe in detail the more than 100 or so counterfeits of the first two Tuscany issues.\\"Serrane, Fernand.

The Castello normanno (\\"Norman Castle\\") is a castle in Patern√≤, in the Province of Catania, Sicily, southern Italy. History The castle was built in 1072 by Count Roger I of Sicily to protect the Simeto valley from Islamic raids. The first nucleus of the fortress was soon enlarged, and it subsequently lost its original military functions. Under Henry VI it was made the seat of the Count of Patern√≤, assigned to his fellow Swabian Bartholomew of Luci. Later the castle housed kings and queens, such as Henry's son Emperor Frederick II, Eleanor of Anjou and Blanche I of Navarre, as the castle had been included in the so-called Camera Reginale estates (\\"Queen's Chamber\\") by King Frederick III of Sicily. The Chamber was abolished in the 15th century, and in 1431 the castle was acquired by the Special family; until 1456 it was owned by the Moncada family. Used as a jail, in the following centuries it became increasingly decayed, until restoration work begun in the 19th century brought it back to its ancient prominence. Description The castle has a rectangular plan, on three floors, with a height of 34 m. Originally, it had Ghibelline-style merlons, of which today only remains can be seen. Notable is the colour effect created by the dark shade of the stones and the frames of the Gothic-style mullioned windows, in white limestone. The first-storey houses several service chambers and the Chapel of St. John, decorated with precious 13th-century frescoes. The piano nobile houses a large Weapons Hall.

Introduced in 2015, the \\"Bett Futures\\" feature aimed at selecting and promoting 30 educational technology start-ups, selected by a panel of expert educators.http://www.bettshow.com/Content/Bett-Futures-2015 A large number of seminars from well-known providers are held at Bett, which offer training (Continuing Professional Development) opportunities for education professionals. The then Education Secretary Michael Gove gave keynote speeches at the 2012 and 2014 events. In 2015 the then Education Secretary Nicky Morgan gave her first opening keynote for the show.http://www.bettshow.com/Content/Rt-Hon-Nicky-Morgan Professor Brian Cox has twice been keynote speaker, in 2013 and 2020. Criticised in the past for perhaps marginalising teachers due to the increasing business nature of the show, the former organisers (i2i Events Group) introduced a number of teacher friendly events such as TeachMeet and edtech start-up initiative Bett Futures, to turn this around.

Erhard Kroeger or Kr√∂ger (24 March 1905, Riga ‚Äì 24 September 1987) was a Baltic German SS officer involved in the resettlement of Baltic Germans before World War II. He commanded an Einsatzgruppe in 1941, and was later attached to General Andrey Vlasov and the German sponsored Russian Liberation Army of World War II. He was convicted of war crimes in 1969. Early years Erhard Kroeger grew up in Riga, Latvia, a member of the historic Baltic German minority there. In his youth, he played ice hockey with Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt. Kroeger made his name as an SS activist challenging the conservative Baltic German leadership of Wilhelm von R√ºdiger and trying to Nazify the Latvian German minority before 1939. ‚ÄúIn July 1937 the new VOMI chief ordered Eric Mundel, who in 1935 had replaced R√ºdiger as the leader of the Volksgemeinschaft [Latvian German minority association], to bring Kr√∂ger into the leadership.‚ÄùHimmler‚Äôs Auxiliaries; The Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle and the German National Minorities of Europe, 1933‚Äì1945, Valdis O.

Lumans, 1993, page.106. SS Sturmbannf√ºhrer Kroeger was admonished by his SS and VOMI superiors and visited Berlin in September 1939 where he was secretly advised of the Nazi plans to trade Latvia and Estonia to Joseph Stalin. In a post-war document he related: > The only thing that rushed through my mind was the salvation of an essential > and closely linked ethnic group which, it seemed to me, was at this moment > already threatened with certain destruction without even knowing it.Deborah > Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt, Auschwitz; 1270 to the Present ‚Äì 1996, pages > 129‚Äì130. At a meeting with Heinrich Himmler, Kroeger stressed the serious hostility and animosity of the Communists to the Baltic Germans following the Russian civil war. > The next day Himmler received him for a second time. He had spoken to > Hitler, and he told Kroeger that ‚Äúthe F√ºhrer agreed with the evacuation of > the Baltic German community as a whole, but stipulated that this should be > done with the approval of the Soviet government.‚Äù Himmler also reported that > the Baltic Germans were to be settled in those parts of Poland annexed to > the Reich, including Posen and West Prussia.Deborah Dwork and Robert Jan van > Pelt, Auschwitz; 1270 to the Present ‚Äì 1996, page.130. Erhard Kroeger then worked extremely hard to ensure as many as 60,000 Baltic Germans were allowed to leave Estonia and Latvia over the autumn of 1939 to be settled in Germany. Einsatzkommando Following the Nazi attack on Soviet Union, SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Erhard Kroeger was part of an Einsatzgruppe between June and November 1941. From June to November 1941 commanded Einsatzkommando 6 of Einsatzgruppe C. While in command of this unit it murdered 100 Jews at Dobromyl. Kroeger had initially been ordered to kill 307 Jews, but the number to be murdered was reduced after he complained. He was personally present for the killings. Kroeger was decorated with the Iron Cross while commander of the Einsatzkommando. SS-Oberf√ºhrer. Head of Sonderkommando Ost which was set up by the SD. In 1943 was enlisted in Division SS \\"Hohenstaufen\\". Also Head of the Russian desk in Leitstelle Ost under Arlt from July 1944. Vlasov In 1944 the SS took an interest in General Andrey Vlasov and his Russian Liberation Movement and in summer the head of the SS main leadership office, SS Obergruppenf√ºhrer Gottlob Berger, specifically appointed Kroeger as a formal liaison officer between Vlasov and the SS.Strik-Strikfeldt, W. Against Stalin and Hitler: Memoir of the Russian Liberation Movement, 1941‚Äì1945. ‚Äî NY: Day, 1970, page.209. Postwar Until 1962 he lived under assumed names in the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland and in Bologna. On 10 January 1962 the District Court of Wuppertal issued an arrest warrant for Kroeger on suspicion that he had been involved in massacres during the war. He was subsequently arrested on 31 December 1965 in Steinmaur-S√ºnikon in the canton of Zurich. The Land of North Rhine-Westphalia then made a formal extradition request. Kroeger argued that the twenty-year limitation period for prosecution had expired, and that the killings were politically motivated, that he was not present for most of the killings, and that those that he did admit involvement in legitimate wartime reprisals under international law. The Swiss Federal Court rejected this argument, however, and agreed to his extradition. After extradition to Germany and the issuance of a second arrest warrant on 22 February 1966, Kroeger was held in custody from 17 May 1966 until 5 October 1967. On 31 July 1969 Kroeger was sentenced by the District Court of Tuebingen to three years and four months in prison for the mass killing of Jews in Western Ukraine between June 1941 and February 1942.

Players in these games are faced with large scale challenges, or raids, which may only be surmounted through the concerted effort of dozens of players at a time. While many players may be involved in defeating a boss, the boss will reward the group with only a small number of items desired by the players. Faced with this scarcity, some system of fairly distributing the items must be established. Used originally in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game EverQuest, dragon kill points are points that are awarded to players for defeating bosses and redeemed for items that those bosses would \\"drop\\". At the time, most of the bosses faced by the players were dragons, hence the name. While not transferable outside of a particular guild, DKP are often treated in a manner similar to currency by guilds. They are paid out at a specified rate and redeemed in modified first or second price auctions, although these are not the only methods by which DKP may be redeemed or awarded. However, Dragon kill points are distinct from the virtual currencies in each game world which are designed by the game developers; DKP systems vary from guild to guild and the points themselves only have value in regard to the dispersal of boss \\"loot\\". Origin and motivation DKP systems were first designed for Everquest in 1999 by Thott as part of the creation of a guild called \\"Afterlife\\" and named for two dragons, Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen. Quoted in Malone, 2007 Since then, it has been adapted for use in other similar online games, in World of Warcraft for example an Avatar named Dragonkiller started its popular use and other programmers designed applications so that the system could work in game as an application to track data for achievements made. Unlike pen and paper or more traditional role-playing video games, massively multiplayer online games could present challenges so significant that the number of players required to defeat them would greatly exceed the number of items awarded to the raid following the boss kill‚Äîa raid of 25 individuals may only see two or three items \\"drop\\". The actual number of players required to defeat a specific boss varies from game to game, but the person-hours invested are non-trivial. Raid encounters may involve \\"10-200 players organized to achieve a common goal over a period of typically around 3-6 continuous hours\\" and demand teamwork and competence from all raid members. As the number of players required to defeat a boss grows, so does the problem of distributing the rewards from such efforts. Since these items appear, or \\"drop\\", in quantities much smaller than the total number of players in the group required to defeat them, a means of deciding which of the players should receive the items is necessary. At the \\"endgame\\", new items rewarded from boss kills represent one of the only means to continue to enhance the combat effectiveness of the character or the social standing of the player. As such, individual players care about receiving a fair shot at dropped items.Castronova & Fairfield 2006, pp. 1‚Äì3 Guilds facing smaller challenges with fewer players typically begin by allotting items through a simulated roll of the dice (provided by the software serving the game itself), similar to dice rolls used to dictate the outcome of contingent events in pen and paper role-playing games. As the number of players expands, rolls may be weighted by seniority within the guild or adjusted by some other measure so as to ensure that veterans of the guild do not lose out on an item to a new member.Castronova & Fairfield 2006, p. 7 Games and dungeons which require larger groups of players may create the incentive for more formal DKP systems. Methods to reward items according to seniority or performance developed out of these modifications, including systems relying on a formal allotment of points per kill. Mechanics of a DKP system The basic concepts of most DKP systems are simple. Players are given points for participating in raids or other guild events and spend those points on the item of their choice when the boss 'drops' the item. A player who does not get a chance to spend their DKP accumulates it between raids and is able to spend it in the future. These points, while earned and spent like currency, are not the same thing as the virtual currency provided by the game company for the virtual world. The points themselves represent only the social contract that guilds extend to players. Should that player leave the guild or the guild disband, those points become valueless.Malone, p. 17 These measures vary considerably in usage. Some guilds eschew formalized 'loot' systems completely, allowing guild leaders to direct which players receive items from bosses. Some use complex measures to determine item price while others use an auction system to allocate goods via bidding. A few common variations are described below. =Zero-sum DKP= Zero- sum DKP systems are designed to ensure the net change in points among the raid is zero for each item dropped, as the name might suggest. When the item drops, each player who is interested in it indicates as much to a guild leader. The player who has the highest DKP total receives the item for its specified price and the same number of points are divided evenly among the rest of the raid and given out, resulting in no net change to the raid total. As a result, the raid would only be rewarded DKP if at least one player desired the item dropped by the boss. Since over time guilds will revisit the same boss multiple times, some zero-sum DKP systems are modified to introduce a \\"dummy\\" character which may be awarded DKP for the boss \\"kill\\" even though no player in the guild received an item. This is purely an accounting measure and allows the guild to reward players for defeating a boss if they are using an automated point tracking system.Gilbert, Whitehead and Whitehead, p. 184Malone, pp. 13‚Äì14 =Simple DKP= The simplest DKP variation is one where every item has a set price list and each player earns some specified number of DKP each time they participate in a guild raid. Like zero-sum systems, the player with the most points recorded actually received the item, paying the specified price. Unlike zero-sum, a simple DKP system does not compensate the rest of the raid based in the value of the items received. =Auction systems= Setting \\"prices\\" in DKP for specific items can be difficult, as analysis of a particular item can be subjective and laborious.Castronova & Fairfield 2006, pp. 5‚Äì6 In order to avoid this quandary, guilds may establish an auction system for items. Points are awarded to the player at some specified rate and when the items are awarded to the raid group, players bid DKP for the item of their choice. Auctions may be conducted in an open ascending fashion or through sealed bids over private messages to guild leaders. While this process results in relatively efficient allocation of items to players willing to part with DKP, it presents the social consequence that perceived selfish bidding could result in an item being awarded to a character who would not make the best use of it. =GDKP (Gold DKP)= Gold DKP (GDKP) is a system developed for pick up groups (PUG). This system was introduced to support individuals without a guild to support raids for difficult bosses/zones. In GDKP, when a boss is killed, each item dropped is put up for auction with a low value. Each item is then auctioned. The eventual winner pays the loot master, and after every item has been auctioned off, every participant in the group is rewarded an equal share of gold. For example, if 20 members were in the group, and 500 gold was spent on items, each raid participant would receive 25 gold. DKP as virtual capital Since the intention of DKP is to allocate scarce resources amongst guild members, they can be understood in the context of virtual capital. Players \\"earn\\" and \\"spend\\" DKP, bidding in a system of auctions for an item which holds some value for them. DKP are referred to as \\"currency\\" a guild leader pays his \\"employees\\". Despite these analogies, DKP remain a kind of \\"private money system\\", allowing guilds to mete out these otherwise unachievable items in return for participation and discipline.Castronova & Fairfield 2006, p. 8 The points cannot be traded or redeemed outside the guild and are not actually part of the game itself; they are tracked on external websites. In contrast, the virtual currencies created by game developers are part of the game software and may be traded between players without respect to any social affiliation. Just as DKP is valueless outside the guild, parlaying of economic capital for DKP (paying real world currency in exchange for DKP) is almost unheard of.Castronova & Fairfield 2006, pp. 7‚Äì10 Because guilds mete out DKP in return for participation in events, the functional result is that DKP serve less as currency or material capital and more as what Torill Mortensen refers to as a \\"social stabilizer\\"; players who attend raids more frequently or play by the rules reap the rewards while more \\"casual\\" gamers do not. This provides an incentive for players to remain in the social system (the guild) longer than they might otherwise.Malone, pp. 16‚Äì19 Within the guild, DKP may stand in for competence‚Äîhigh level items (Krista-Lee Malone mentions a specific item from World of Warcraft, the \\"Cold Snap\\" wand) are forms of cultural capital themselves.Malone, p. 18 Since the items are \\"bound\\" to the player who first receives them, the only way to wield a desired item is to be involved in the raid that defeated the boss which rewards it. As such, a \\"Cold Snap\\" represents a signal to other players that the bearer has defeated a particular high-level monster and therefore mastered the skills needed to do so. The points themselves represent a m√©lange of cultural and material capital.

It is a non-auditioned band (with the exception of the battery section), open to all majors. With approximately 220 members, the band is one of the largest organizations on campus. About the GSMB left The GSMB does pregame and halftime performances for the NDSU Bison Football team in the Fargodome. The band usually plays seven shows a year including all home football games and usually one away game, marches the homecoming parade, and does a handful of other performances at NDSU and the Fargo-Moorhead area. The GSMB has also performed in the Minnesota State Fair in 2017 and 2018, marching in the Sunday parade. =Rehearsal= The GSMB practices Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 4:00-5:45pm, and Saturday morning rehearsals on game days. The band practices indoors in the music building of the Reineke Fine Arts Center. Outdoors, the band practices either on the football practice field, or Dacotah Field, which in 2017 was updated with brand new field turf. Despite starting band camp with warm temperatures, the band sometimes ends up practicing with snow on the field at the end of the season. The GSMB usually does not regularly practice in the Fargodome, only on game day mornings and days when the dome does not have a prior event. =Game Day= The GSMB in the star formation Game Day starts with mandatory section breakfasts at 5 AM. All band members are then present for morning rehearsal at the Fargodome. After morning rehearsal the band has a later call time to be in the band room of the music building. At call, all sections are accounted for and uniforms inspected. The band then goes outside to start the march over. The march over is a seven or so block parade-style march from the music building, through the NDSU campus, up to the Fargodome. Once at the dome, the band performs pregame consisting of a field entrance, a fanfare to different sides of the stadium, On Bison while marching down the field, a trio of patriotic songs (Battle Hymn of the Republic, Grand Old Flag/ America the Beautiful), while forming the shape of a star. The band plays the NDSU alma mater The Yellow and The Green and directly after the song the announcer proclaims \\"We ARE the Pride of North Dakota\\". The band then forms \\"NDSU\\" while playing Fight Song (We are the Pride of North Dakota) and forms \\"BISON\\" facing the student section side of the dome. The band marches towards the team entrance, forms a tunnel for the team to run out, and plays On Bison as the team runs out. When the lights come back on, the band plays the Star-Spangled Banner, and finally the exits the field. The band sits in the south end-zone directly next to the student section(s). The band then performs a show at halftime, and returns to the stands for the conclusion of the game.

In spring 1903, Clarence Simeon Putnam, a local Fargo doctor, watched his downtown Fargo medical practice burn to the ground ‚Äì five days after his insurance had lapsed. Essentially out of a job, Putnam landed a position teaching arithmetic at North Dakota Agricultural College. While the next set of events is not entirely clear, a need arose for leadership of NDAC‚Äôs ROTC band. Putnam, a cornetist, found himself in charge of 14 members known as the ‚ÄúCadet Band‚Äù on April 14, 1903. While the band regards the first full year of Doc Putnam‚Äôs association with the band (1904) as its ‚Äúbirthday,‚Äù student newspaper references indicate a band existed as early as 1901. In fall 1902, Claude Nugent, secretary of the college, and Harry M. Rudd, a local musician, purchased instruments from a local farmer with the intention of creating an NDAC band. Rudd directed the band in some capacity until April 1903 when C.S. Putnam took over. GSMB in the 70s Band in the 80s Putnam‚Äôs leadership was quite dynamic and the band thrived under his direction. This peaked in 1923-24 when the band as an ROTC unit earned its third consecutive 100 percent inspecting rating, which entitled it to a presidential citation and a ‚ÄúGold Star‚Äù rating. Putnam incorporated the moniker into the band‚Äôs name and the Gold Star Band was born. Following Putnam‚Äôs death in 1944, the band‚Äôs numbers deteriorated until former Gold Star Band member William Euren became director in 1948. Euren restored the band‚Äôs pre-war numbers and worked toward expanding its persona beyond its military role. Euren retired in 1968, and Roger Sorenson became director of bands for two years before leaving in 1970. During his brief tenure, Sorenson engendered a level of lasting loyalty among alumni who performed under his direction. Orville Eidem arrived in 1970 and was director of bands for the next 23 years. Besides the perpetuation of the marching band tradition, Eidem also had a great love of jazz and expanded the scope of NDSU‚Äôs program. The band also played a role in lobbying efforts for a new facility. Reineke Fine Arts Center replaced Putnam Hall and the old Festival Hall in 1981. Several other names have been associated with the band. While C.S. Putnam was away from the band in 1914-17, Harold Bachman and B.A. Orr were directors. Edward D. Schroepfer directed the band following Putnam‚Äôs death. Roy Johnson also played a significant role in the band‚Äôs musical leadership during the Sorenson years. 2008 Drum Majors Orville Eidem retired in 1993, at which time Wayne F. Dorothy became the new director. Dorothy was previously Assistant Director of Bands under Eidem. Then in 1999, Dorothy retired and was replaced by Warren Olfert as director of bands. 2007 was a year for changes when Dr. Sigurd Johnson was hired as the newly created Athletics Band director leading the marching band and pep band. For the 2008 season, the band received new uniforms, recovered gold drums, and the addition of a front ensemble (pit). The GSMB is currently growing and is evident in the growth of the band from 83 in 2007, to 163 in 2008, to 185 in 2009, and to 220 in 2010. TraditionsMarch Over= The march over is a parade-like march through the NDSU campus. It starts from the music building, up Albrecht Boulevard through campus, and around the front entrance to the Fargodome. Once at the dome, the band splits into three bands and performs for tailgaters in the west dome lot, for the president's reception, and for fans in front of the Fargodome. The band joins together and enters the Fargodome from the north ramp of the dome. The march over is known for its various hijinks including chants, random follow the leader, section swapping of instruments, and dances. Stop-sign slapping used to be a common tradition of march over, however this has been discontinued due to safety concern. In the past there used to be a night march over every year in which the band would wear glow sticks and lights in the twilight of a fall game night. 2010 Band in the Stands of the Fargodome =Victory Polka= After a Bison victory in a football, basketball, or volleyball game; the band performs the traditional playing and singing of all 5 verses of \\"In Heaven there is no Beer\\". This stirred up controversy after the 2016 victory against the Iowa Hawkeyes, who also uses the song in football victories. Various rumors spread across social media accusing NDSU of mocking Iowa's defeat. =The Yellow and the Green= Every time the Gold Star Marching Band has a group meal together, the president of the band or one of the current Drum Majors will ask the band to stand and sing the NDSU alma mater, the Yellow and the Green. Rookies are required to learn the SATB parts quickly, because they will have to sing it by themselves at the ending band banquet. =Band Banquet and Concert= The Band always holds a band banquet towards the end of the year for the graduating/exiting members. Different awards are given out such as, Section of the Year, Rookie of the Year, and section awards like the green trumpet (member to member), The white and trombone (for the most deserving rookie), and the black trombone (member to member), or the newly established Blue Saxophone in honor of a band member that perished in a car crash in early 2017. Other awards given at the banquet are meant as more humorous than the above, and include the likes of tongue-in- cheek superlatives \\"Back in High School\\", \\"Wolf in Sheepish Clothing\\", and \\"Please Be Quiet\\" (for those who are), and \\"No SERIOUSLY Be QUIET\\" (for those who aren't). The band also performs the Sounds of the Gridiron concert at the end of the season. All of the halftime shows, the pregame, and some of the stands music are all performed.

It has been called the world's first commercial distillery. Stein had taken over some land and distilling operations from a local monastery. (Stein's distillery is now in ruins, and fund-raising was attempted in early 2015 in an effort to try to preserve its remnants.) Robert Haig was a distiller in the early 1600s and a member of the Scottish Clan Haig family. His great-grandson Kane McKenzie Haig, who lived in the Kennetpans area, married Margaret Stein of the Stein family in 1751 and founded the company known as John Haig & Co. Their daughter, also named Margaret, married a local lawyer John Jameson from Alloa in 1788. On marriage, John and Margaret Jameson moved to Dublin to run a new Stein family distillery in Bow Street which had been opened in 1780. Contrary to popular belief, the Jameson Irish Whiskey company was not actually founded in 1780, but in 1810 when John Jameson bought the distillery from his wife's cousins, the Steins. The original Jameson Distillery in Bow Street is now home to the Jameson Visitor Centre. The Stein, Haig, and Jameson families were significant figures in the whisky market from that time forward. A Haig distillery, now known as the Cameronbridge distillery, was founded in 1824. In 1830, it became the first distillery to produce grain whisky using the column still method invented by Robert Stein in 1826 (before the later better-known refinement developed by Aeneas Coffey). John Haig & Co. was subsequently merged into the Distillers Company Limited (DCL) in 1877. DCL combined with John Walker & Son and Buchanan-Dewar in 1925 and was then acquired by Guinness in 1986,Guinness directors showed 'contempt for truth' BBC, 28 November 1997 which put it into its United Distillers subsidiary in 1987. Guinness then merged with Grand Metropolitan to form Diageo in 1997.Diageo: History Most current variations of the Haig brand are produced using spirits from Diageo's Glenkinchie distillery and Linkwood distillery. Bottle design Haig was bottled in a distinctive three-sided bottle with dimpled sides, starting in the 1890s. The bottle was registered as a trademark in the US in 1958 by Julius Lunsford.

The gorge The Furlo Pass (Italian: Gola del Furlo or Passo del Furlo) is a gorge on the ancient Roman road Via Flaminia in the Marche region of central Italy, where it passes near the Candigliano river, a tributary of the Metauro. The gorge was formed between the Pietralata (889 m) and Paganuccio (976 m) mountains by the river Candigliano, which whooshed in full spate through the district until it was dammed in 1922. Since 2001 it has been included in a State Natural Reserve of the same name. It is often marketed to tourists in the region as the \\"Grand Canyon of Italy.\\" The Roman emperor Vespasian had a tunnel built here to facilitate passage on the Via Flaminia at the narrowest point of the gorge (hence the name, from the Latina forulum, meaning \\"small hole\\"). Next to it is a similar but smaller tunnel dating from Etruscan times. The tunnel has a length of 38.30 meters and a height of 5.95 meters. During the Gothic Wars (6th century), the Ostrogoth King Totila had the pass fortified, but his troops were ousted by the Roman general Belisarius. The Lombards conquered the pass between 570 and 578, and destroyed the fortifications. In the following centuries Via Flaminia was nearly abandoned. In 1502 Lucrezia Borgia used it on a journey to Ferrara and in 1506 Julius II took the road on his way to Bologna. In the beginning of the 18th century the transit remained difficult and dangerous, and only in 1776 was the tunnel and the road re-opened. Between May 23 and June 12, 1849, soldiers of the Roman Republic, commanded by Colonel L. Pianciani, fought a skirmish in the pass with the Austrian army. During the Second World War, the Gorge experienced moments of tension, but it was not the scene of fierce clashes. The seventies saw increasing destruction of the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape, as well as the deterioration of the road, due to the intense activity in quarries located within the Gorge. The gorge. In the 1930s, a profile of Benito Mussolini was sculpted on the slopes of Mount Pietralata by a local branch of the Guardia Forestale (State Forestry Corps), which was destroyed by partisans during World War II.

The cheese is produced from cows‚Äô milk, Swaledale sheep's milk and goats‚Äô milk. Description The cheeses are round in shape with an average weight for the cheese wheel of and are made with unpasteurised milk. The animals whose milk is used to make Swaledale cheese, all graze on land in Swaledale which makes their milk characteristic of the area as a particular mixture of herbs and grasses grow there due to its soil and climate and this give the cheese distinctive properties. The cheese has a moist medium firm texture and its flavour is described as having ‚Äúthe freshness of the misty Dales and wild bracken, with the sweet caramel undertone of ewes‚Äô milk‚Äù. Production Swaledale cheese is handmade to a recipe from Swaledale, the knowledge of which is limited to a few people. Milk from farms in Swaledale is collected and, in the first stage of the cheesemaking process, heated to with microbiological culture. After being left for two hours rennet is added to the milk. The mixture is then left to curdle for an hour after which time the resulting curd is heated to 28 ¬∞C, cut up and stirred. It is then cut up again, drained and the resulting cubes stacked up, before the blocks are broken up and then put into moulds lined with muslin. The moulds are then lightly pressed during storage at 28 ¬∞C for 18 hours, and are turned once after four hours. Once the cheese has finished being pressed it is removed from the moulds and is soaked in a solution of 85% brine for 24 hours. After being made Swaledale cheese is stored in humid cellars. While the cheese is maturing, if it is not covered in natural wax, a grey-blue mould grows on its rind. The cheese takes between three and four weeks to mature. History Legends about the Yorkshire Dales, the area that includes Swaledale, say the origin of cheese making lie with Cistercian monks from Normandy who settled in the area in the 11th century. Their techniques were passed on to local farmers in Swaledale who continued to produce cheese, although the monks left during the dissolution of the monasteries. In 18th century cheese was produced at farmhouses within Swaledale and sold fresh with a white colour or ripe once they had developed a blue colouration. These cheeses' high moisture content and open texture allowed them to blue easily when they were matured in damp conditions. Cheesemaking started to decline in Swaledale at the start of the 20th century and by 1980 only one farm in Swaledale, Harkerside above Reeth, was still making cheese. In the early 1980s this cheese stopped being produced as well, until Mrs Longstaff gave the original recipe for Swaledale cheese to David and Mandy Reed who founded the Swaledale Cheese company in February 1987 to produce the cheese. Awards In 1995 Swaledale Cheese and Swaledale Ewes Cheese were awarded European protected designation of origin (PDO) status. Swaledale cheeses have won a number of awards including three gold awards at the 2008 Great Taste Awards and three gold and two bronze medals at 2008 World Cheese Awards.

Established in 2006, EWG members share a common commitment to free and fair elections and good governance in Bangladesh. The guiding objectives of the EWG are: 1\\\\. To support free and fair elections through pre-election, election day, and post-election observation 2\\\\. To conduct voter and civic education in key thematic areas that encourage the full participation of all segments of society in the electoral process 3\\\\. To promote electoral reform through public dialogue and advocacy The National Secretariat of the EWG, headed by a Director, coordinates the day-to-day activities of the EWG on behalf of its members, with oversight from an elected Executive Committee. Through its wide and varied membership, the EWG has outreach down to the village level throughout Bangladesh, making it an effective network through which to deliver voter information materials and to recruit both stationary and mobile election observers. A national network, but international in reach, EWG members have participated in election observation missions in various countries, including Thailand and the Philippines.  EWG Programs  The EWG has implemented several programs since its establishment. These include: Preparation for the 2006 elections: the EWG planned to implement voter education and election observation activities for the cancelled January 2007. Using a multi-tier program delivery mechanism, the network had outreach to the sub-union level. By early January 2007, when the EWG pre-election program activities were suspended on the basis of a consensus decision of all members, the EWG secretariat and member organizations had recruited and trained 64 district coordinators, over 500 sub-district or thana coordinators, and more than 5,000 union coordinators to implement field activities. Over 165,000 stationary and mobile observers were prepared to act as election day observers. EWG monthly public perception studies: Since February 2007, the EWG has conducted monthly national public perception studies on the political and economic environment under the state of emergency. The studies probe key aspects of public opinion such as citizen concerns about current policies, confidence in the Caretaker Government, perceptions of the economy, views on anti-corruption activities, and overall appraisal of current circumstances as compared to those under the past elected government. EWG support for the national voter registration process: Between August 2007 and August 2008 the EWG conducted a nationwide program of voter education designed to motivate eligible voters to complete registration for the milestone national electoral roll with photographs. This was carried out through a cooperative working relationship with the Bangladesh Election Commission. The EWG campaign had a strong focus on historically difficult to reach segments of the population including women, ethnic and religious minorities, disabled persons, and residents of geographically remote areas. EWG city corporation election activities: the EWG was actively engaged in the August 4, 2008 city corporation and pourashava elections with a program consisting of election observation and voter education activities. The local government elections provided an opportunity to test coordinating mechanisms and program delivery and other systems and procedures that EWG will utilize on a larger scale in the upcoming national parliamentary and upazila elections. 2008 national parliamentary elections: the EWG has developed a comprehensive voter education and election observation plan for the 2008 election. Voter education activities will emphasize: creating a knowledgeable electorate; the need to vote for candidates with clear policies; and citizen demand for greater accountability of elected representatives. These themes are evident in its array of public service announcements for television and radio broadcast, brochures, posters, and other printed materials, and locally organized activities such as town hall meetings and candidate debates. While voter education is designed to strengthen the content of the elections, EWG has a comprehensive election observation plan in which observers will be deployed to all polling booths throughout Bangladesh.  EWG Funding  As a coalition of established organizations, the EWG serves as a cost-efficient mechanism for implementing election-related programs nationwide. All member organizations devote staff time and resources. Importantly, they can be mobilized in a short period of time to deliver programs. Since 2006, the EWG has received financial support and technical assistance from The Asia Foundation. The EWG is grateful for the generous financial support of the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), the Royal Danish Embassy, the Royal Norwegian Embassy, the Swedish International Development Assistance (Sida), the Swiss Development Corporation, and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

After the bombing, it was housed by the struggling Conservative Club at 74 St James's Street, which eventually agreed to a full merger in 1950 under the name of the Bath Club, retaining the Conservative Club's St James's Street club house until 1959. It subsequently moved to 43 Brook Street, and it finally closed in 1981. The Bath Club was a very elegant Club just down the Street from Claridge's. Unusually for London Clubs It had a ladies section with an elegant drawing room for afternoon tea. At the ground floor level there was a large dining room with paintings very like Canaletto's on the walls. Upstairs there was a lounge area with backgammon and card tables and separately a bar. Off the lounge area was a full sized Snooker Table. A consortium of members acquired control of the club and then proceeded to sell the lease. The other members could do nothing to stop it. The Club was closed in 1981 with members being offered the opportunity to join either the Navel and Military Club or the Carlton Club. The club was famous for its annual mixed backgammon Tournaments the last of which was held in May 1980. The Club also had its own squash courts, unusual for a central London Location and the Bath Club Cup was an annual fixture for London Squash players.

An increased capacity variant known as the Boarhound was never flown,Gunston 1989, p.18. and a related, much larger, design known as the Wolfhound existed on paper only. Development of these engines was interrupted in April 1941, when the company's factory was bombed, and on 3 October 1941 the project was cancelled by the Air Ministry. Design and development The Deerhound I was a triple-row, 21-cylinder, air- cooled radial engine design with the unusual feature of inline cylinder banks. Unlike earlier Armstrong Siddeley engines the Deerhound used overhead camshafts to operate its poppet valves, using one camshaft for each bank of three cylinders.Lumsden 2003, p.77. Flight testing began in 1938 using an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley II, serial number K7243, during which cooling problems were encountered with the rear row of cylinders. This problem was solved by a 'reversed-flow' cooling system, in which a large air duct at the rear of the cowling took in air and directed it forward to exit behind the propeller.Lumsden 2003, p.77. The project suffered a severe setback when the Whitley crashed on takeoff in March 1940, fatally injuring its crew. The accident was attributed to an incorrect elevator trim setting and was not related to the engines.Lumsden 2003, p.77. A single prototype Deerhound III was built and ran, and survived until the late-1970s before being scrapped. Development work on the early engines was cancelled by the Air Ministry on 23 April 1941, but running of the Mk III was allowed to continue until 3 October 1941; at this point all records were ordered to be handed over to Rolls-Royce. A projected increased capacity variant known as the Boarhound was planned but never built, and a related much larger design, the Wolfhound, existed on paper only.

A translation into Dutch by Daan Cartens is entitled, Wij doden Stella. A French translation of the novella was published in 1995 under the title, Nous avons tu√© Stella.) is a novella by Austrian writer Marlen Haushofer first published in 1958 about the death of the eponymous heroine, a 19-year-old woman who has just begun to experience her awakening sexuality. Narrated by Anna, a 40-year-old mother of two in whose house Stella has spent her final months, Wir t√∂ten Stella provides an insight into the bourgeois society of post-war Austria and paints a picture of a deteriorating family whose overall ambition is to keep up appearances. Plot introduction Set in the late 1950s,The narrator mentions the fact that her 15-year-old son Wolfgang is a wartime child. the novella takes the form of a written confession committed to paper in the course of a weekend shortly after Stella's death during which the narrator is alone at home, as her husband Richard and their two children have left the city to visit Richard's mother. Anna realizes that on the surface level everything is back to normal again now that Stella is no longer around: an intruder imposed on the family who was threatening to upset the equilibrium carefully, and tacitly, maintained by each family member has left again. However, Anna cannot but delve deeper into the matter: guilt-ridden, and unable to find any peace of mind, let alone happiness, she remembers many details of Stella's stay in the house, and starts relating the events that have led to the catastrophe of her death in chronological order. Plot summary When Luise, Stella's mother, asks her old friend Anna if her family could put up her daughter for the duration of one schoolyear so that she can attend commercial school in the city, they unwillingly agree. Though a natural beauty, Stella is an unrefined country girl who wears neither make-up nor perfume and who dresses in nondescript clothes. Her diffident politeness does not endear her to her hosts and makes it easy for them not to integrate her into the family. Stella does not keep in touch with her mother either, who has gone to Italy on a months- long holiday spree with her lover. Anna has known for many years that her husband is a womanizer but has always felt unable to confront him or do anything about his love affairs. A successful lawyer whose office is in the city centre, and a respectable pillar of society, Richard seemingly takes every chance that offers itself to betray his wife. Careless about leaving traces, he often comes home late at night, allegedly after a long day at the office, when his wife is already in bed pretending to be asleep, and time and again she can smell other women's perfume or detect smears of lipstick on his shirt. Annette, their daughter, who is of primary school age, is the only one in the family who does not sense what is going on whereas 15-year-old Wolfgang, their son, does but understand the importance of not bringing up that taboo topic: if he did, he would be one of the likely targets of his father's revenge. It is Anna herself who triggers the subsequent events when she encourages Stella to wear trendier clothes and generally helps her metamorphose into a young lady. Only now seeing her beauty, Richard starts an affair with the sexually inexperienced young woman and, when she gets pregnant, procures an abortion for her performed by one of his old friends who is a gynaecologist.Any termination of pregnancy was illegal under Austrian law until 1975. Mistaking sexual satisfaction for love, Stella keeps pursuing her lover long after she has been dropped by him, a situation complicated by the fact that, at least for the time being, both are living under the same roof. Eventually Stella realizes that Richard has embarked on yet another affair, and throws herself in front of a lorry. Her motives for committing suicide are never openly discussed; rather, the family say they suspect it must have been an accident. Rediscovery Haushofer was awarded the Arthur Schnitzler Prize in 1963. In the 1970s and 80s, the feminist movement tried to claim Haushofer retrospectively as one of their own.Cf. Irmgard Roebling: \\"Drachenkampf aus der Isolation oder Das Fortschreiben geschichtlicher Selbsterfahrung in Marlen Haushofers Romanwerk\\". Since then, the text has been continuously in print in its German original. An English translation is not available. Stage adaptation A dramatized version of Wir t√∂ten Stella in the form of a monologue spoken by Anna was written and performed in Dutch by Natali Broods.

The charity provides low-cost veterinary services to people on a low income in the greater Dublin area. Registered charity The Irish Blue Cross is a registered charity (CHY 5386). Mobile veterinary clinics and partnerships The Irish Blue Cross put its first Mobile Van veterinary clinic onto the streets of Dublin in 1953. The mobile service was founded by Niall Murphy MRCVS,born October 14th,1928.He was a very compassionate and well respected veterinary surgeon who worked in small animal practice and went on to establish the first veterinary hospital in Dublin,at that time in 28 Dartmouth Road,Dunlaoghaire,County Dublin.He studied and at times taught Veterinary Sciences in Trinity College Dublin . Since its foundation, the Blue Cross charity has continued to develop the service whilst extending its support for needy pets through its small-animal clinic in Inchicore and its partnership with private veterinary practices. Since 1945, it has provided care to over 600,000 pets. Ten Blue Cross mobile veterinary clinics are in operation weekly now throughout Dublin and are manned by a dedicated volunteer force of vets, drivers and helpers. Services The Irish Blue Cross provides low-cost veterinary services to pet owners on a low income in the greater Dublin area. In 2012, the charity carried out over 27,000 treatments, vaccinations, check-ups, x-rays, neutering and other operations to pets. These procedures were carried out at the charity‚Äôs Dublin based mobile clinics and at its small-animal clinic in Inchicore. Support and grants The Irish Blue Cross relies on donations from the general public to cover the costs of carrying out its work. It has many fundraising events throughout the year, such as its Easter Raffle, World Animal Week pens campaign, and its ever-popular Bark in the Park‚Ñ¢ sponsored dog walks during the Summer. The Bark in the Park‚Ñ¢ events involve a 4 km walk through some of Dublin's finest parks, a raffle, music, goody bags and prizes for the dog with the Best Bark, Shiniest Coat, Happiest Smile and Waggiest Tail. The charity also receives some funding from the Irish Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Each year, Dublin City Council and other Local Authorities also give significant grant aid to the charity. Horse ambulance services The Irish Blue Cross also operates a horse ambulance service that attends at all Irish racecourses, north and south. In an average year, the frontline fleet of three ambulance units provides about 400 days of service. Experienced staff work closely with racecourse veterinary surgeons to assist racehorses ‚Äòpulled up‚Äô or injured during the course of racing. This service is not paid for from the charity donations provided to the small animal section of The Irish Blue Cross, rather it is separately funded by Horse Racing Ireland and other racing organizations and equine welfare specific donations from some users, horse racing and associated industries. The Irish Blue Cross horse ambulances are also to be seen at the RDS Annual Horse Show, International Horse Trials in Ireland, and some Point-to-Points. The Irish Blue Cross branded horse ambulance units are a regular sight on Irish roads travelling to and from race meetings; have a standing commitment allowing them to provide three fully equipped units at events on any one day, and in exceptional circumstances, utilizing reserve equipment, they can provide up to five units on a single day if necessary. In recent years the horse ambulance fleet have also provided services to the Irish film industry (when scenes involving large numbers of horses or specific stunts are being filmed). Occasionally (and unfortunately) Irish Blue Cross units have had to attend road traffic accidents involving horses injured on the public road, either in collision with vehicles or from incidents involving horseboxes or trailers.

Corfield immediately joined the Volunteers camped on Salisbury Plain, but later enlisted in the Baden Powell Police, sailing for Africa in December 1900. In June 1902 he was recommended for a commission, but this was rejected due to his youth. In 1905 Corfield returned to England, applied for the post of Political Officer in Somalia, and became one of only six Europeans posted to the interior of the country.

By mid-1913 finding these instructions restrictive and irksome, on the afternoon of 8 August 1913 he decided to attack the Dervish army close to Dul Madoba. Dul Madoba is a ridge some 25 miles SE of Burao in what was then British Somaliland. The battle took place on 9 August 1913 between 110 members of the Somaliland Camel Constabulary, reduced to 85 by the time action commenced, and some 2,750 well- armed Dervish followers of Mohamed Abdullah Hassan. Of the Constabulary, 36 including Richard Corfield were killed-in-action and 21 were wounded. On the Dervish side over 450 were killed or wounded. As a result of the action the British withdrew their protection of the local tribes to the area around the port of Berbera but Abdullah Hassan was unable to follow up his advantage immediately.

Scattered individuals or small groups of trees naturally occur from the Illawarra district of New South Wales (34¬Ω¬∞ S) to near Proserpine in tropical Queensland. The white beech or grey teak is a fast-growing tree, growing on volcanic and alluvial soils in areas of moderate to high rainfall. It also grows on poorer sedimentary soils in fire free areas. White beech may occasionally be seen in Australian rainforests, though their status is considered \\"uncommon\\". Unlike the Australian red cedar, the white beech has not recovered particularly well after logging in the 19th and 20th centuries. Taxonomy and naming Ferdinand von Mueller described the white beech as Vitex leichhardtii in 1862, from collections near Myall Creek by Ludwig Leichhardt and Clarence River by Dr. Hermann Beckler. George Bentham reassigned it to the genus Gmelina in his 1870 Flora Australiensis. The genus name honours German botanist Johann Georg Gmelin, while the species name honours Leichhardt, who explored and collected specimens from the country's east and north. White beech was previously classified in the Verbenaceae, but its genus and many others have been transferred into the mint family Lamiaceae. White beech is the standard trade name for the timber, as well as a common name for the species, due to the similarity of the wood to that of European beech, Fagus sylvatica, which is not closely related. Other common names include grey teak. Description Illustration by Margaret Flockton from The Forest Flora of New South Wales. Mature specimens of white beech reach tall, though exceptional individuals can reach tall,Floyd, Alexander G., Australian Rainforests in New South Wales Volume 2 - 1990 page 179 and live for centuries. The base of the largest trees exceeds two and a half metres in diameter, and the trunk is cylindrical with a flanged but not buttressed base. The flanging can extend up the bole. The bark varies from light to dark grey and has a scaled surface with vertical cracks marking sections of trunk. There can be burls. Considered by some to be a semi-deciduous species, losing part of the canopy in late spring. Green leaves are almost always found at the base of the tree, assisting with tree identification. Branchlets are thick, grey or brown and hairy, with easily visible leaf scars. The new shoots are densely covered in fine fur. The mature leaves are pale green and ovate, long. Hairy and veiny on the underside. Midrib, lateral and net veins distinct on the upper surface, conspicuously raised and distinct beneath due to the covering of fawn hairs. Lateral veins eight to ten, straight and forking near the margin at 45 degrees to the midrib. Juvenile leaves are toothed. Purple, yellow and white flowers form in late spring and summer. The fruit are ripe from February to May. Distribution and habitat The main range is from the Blackall Range and the vicinity of Maleny south through to the New South Wales south coast. The locality of Broughtonvale (34¬Ω¬∞ S), near Berry, New South Wales is considered by Anders Bofeldt as the southern limit of natural distribution. However, D.J. Boland considers the far more southerly Clyde River, New South Wales (35¬∞ S) near Batemans Bay to be the southern limit of distribution. There are isolated occurrences in central-northern Queensland in the Eungella Range and on Mt Elliot near Townsville. North of Sydney, it was last recorded in the Wyong area in 1916. The White beech had dense populations in Caloundra before European settlement. White beech is rare and endangered in the Illawarra region. It is likely that fewer than one hundred trees remain in some thirty different sites in the Illawarra. White beech trees in the Illawarra may be seen by the Minnamurra Falls rainforest walk in Budderoo National Park, however, these trees are not signposted. It is found on mountain slopes as well as alluvial soils along riverbanks. On Fraser Island it is even found on sand hills. The usual habitat is subtropical rainforest, where trees occur singly or in small stands of up to five individuals scattered through the forest, associated with such trees as yellow carabeen (Sloanea woollsii), red carabeen (Geissois benthamiana), Queensland kauri pine (Agathis robusta), golden sassafras (Doryphora sassafras), black booyong (Argyrodendron actinophyllum) and white booyong (A. trifoliolatum), as well as members of the genus Flindersia. Ecology The fruit is consumed by the topknot pigeon and wompoo fruit dove. Germination Around Easter time, seeds mature within a fleshy bluish or purple drupe 2 to 3 centimetres in diameter. These are eaten by the wompoo fruit dove, paradise riflebird, topknot pigeon and possibly other large fruit eating birds. The fruit contains a hard wooden capsule. The capsule contains four cells, each with a viable or non viable seed. The fleshy aril needs to be removed, as it contains agents which inhibit seed germination. Regular watering and drying of the capsules seems to improve germination results. Germination is slow and unreliable, taking between six months and four years. Seedlings usually appear in late spring and summer. A successful technique for germinating white beech is to collect new purple fruit. Cut off the fleshy aril. Place the wooden \\"nut\\" in the sun for a few days. When cracks appear around the emerging seed compartments, place it in a large container. Ensure the capsule receives adequate moisture and warmth in the cooler months. Trying to open the hard nut in the middle of the fruit, or hitting the capsule with a hammer has proven useless. The best technique appears to be the removal of the outer blue/purple flesh. Then exposing the inner capsule to sunlight and moisture. The sunlight cracks the outer covering of the capsule. The moisture seeps through the outer shell, affecting the inner seed. When the seed is germinated, it pushes open the cells of the capsule. The majority of capsules will not produce seedlings. A large quantity of capsules is advised for propagation. Timber and uses The timber is durable and greyish without significant markings. However, it splits when nailed. It is prized for templates, pattern making, house construction, planking for boat hulls, flooring, carriage work, wood carving and cabinet work. It weighs around 550 kg per cubic metre. This tree is well suited to parks and large gardens. Gmelina leichhardtii is also seen as a shade tree in farms in former rainforest areas.

In most battles fought during the conflict this was proved not to be possible. There was competition from the other side's ability to undertake evasive measures. The opponent was able to use cover to protect himself and hide his position. Nonetheless, the tactic of the creeping barrage, used at the Relief of Ladysmith, has been described as \\"revolutionary\\".Pakenham, 1992: 361 Battle of Magersfontein - 11 December 1899 The barrage involved twenty-four field guns, four howitzers, and a 4.7 inch naval gun, dubbed 'Joe Chamberlain', in honour of the British Colonial Secretary. \\"Onlookers were told by the naval gunners that Old Joey would kill every man within 150 yards of where his shells struck.\\" However, the bombardment that targeted the hill did not hit the Boers. The British had poor intelligence. The Boers were not hiding on the hill but in a line of trenches close by. It was to be another three months before the Boers finally evacuated, not because of bombardment, but because the British passed round them.Pakenham, 1992: 203 Map showing the battles in the Relief of Ladysmith. Battle of Colenso - 15 December 1899 Here too, the British lacked intelligence about enemy positions. Before the battle, the Boers were hidden and their numbers or positions could not be estimated. In battle, smokeless fire meant that their positions were difficult to locate. Boer guns were also concealed behind emplacements, a practice that was new to late nineteenth warfare.Pakenham, 1992: 207-8, 229 Relief of Ladysmith - 14‚Äì28 February 1900 The British had success when they ceased using artillery by itself and used it in conjunction with infantry. British General Buller linked the use of artillery and the movement of infantry into continuous interlocking assaults upon each hill south of Ladysmith. As soon as shelling had finished in a location the infantry moved. The front collapsed on the 27th when use was made of a creeping curtain of shell fire sent over the heads of advancing infantry destroying everything 100 yards ahead of them.

It received mixed reviews. Synopsis After fighting a terrorist crisis in the Adirondack Mountains, the Fantastic Four feel that after long careers helping to defend humanity, that they should retire. However Reed Richards discovers some strange unusual events such as birds dying, disappearing desert oases, the evaporation of Earth's ozone layer, and unusual oceanic tides. The Watcher arrives to bid farewell to Reed, informing him that the Cosmic Tribunal has decided to destroy the warfare-prone human race by unleashing a greater being known as the Adjudicator. As the Adjudicator arrives on Earth to announce his intentions, all of humanity is not convinced of the threat. Namor and his Atlantean army begin to attack New York City, under the mistaken belief that humanity has caused the oceanic disturbances, but Reed convinces him that it is the Adjudicator's doing. Namor attacks the Adjudicator, but the Adjudicator forces Namor and his armies to retreat, and also repels attacks from human armies and Doctor Doom, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and the Inhumans. Richards and the Silver Surfer attempt to use mindless robots called the Decimators to destroy the Cosmic Tribunal, but eventually abort their attack, rather than allow an entire race to be slaughtered. The Tribunal is grateful to the Fantastic Four, and to humanity. After the Fantastic Four is honored by the United Nations, they finally retire.

The attack is then done by running forward at your opponent and then cutting diagonally down on their neck. The kiai is a loud \\"Ei!\\". Traditionally this is practised using a long wooden stick, and cutting against a vertical pole, or even a real tree. During a hard practice, the wood is said to give off the smell of smoke. During the Edo period, at the height of its popularity, adepts of Jigen-ry≈´ were said to practice striking the pole 3,000 times in the morning, and another 8,000 times in the afternoon.

It is found growing in coastal and estuarine locations in India, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Oceania. Description A. alba forms a low, dense bushy crown often branching near the base of the trunk. The shrub does not grow more than about high. The roots are shallow and send up a large number of pencil-shaped pneumatophores. These aerial roots help with gas exchange and also play an important part in the exclusion of salt from the plant's vascular system. The trunk has smooth, greenish-black bark that is finely fissured and does not flake. The dark green leaves, long and wide, have a silvery grey underside and grow in opposite pairs. The small, orange yellow flowers, borne in a racemose inflorescence, have four petals and a diameter of about when expanded. The fruits are greyish-green capsules and conical in shape with an elongated beak up to long. Each contains a single seed.Api Api Putih Mangrove and Wetland Wildlife at Sungei Buloh Nature Park. Retrieved 2012-02-07. In the Malay language it is known as api api putih, api meaning \\"fire\\", referring to the fact that this mangrove attracts fireflies, and putih meaning \\"white\\", referring to the pale-coloured underside of the leaves.Api-api Putih (Avicennia alba) The Tide Chaser. Retrieved 2012-02-08. Distribution and habitat A. alba is found off South and Southeast Asia, the islands of the South Pacific Ocean, and Australia. It is common in the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve in Singapore. It grows on tidal regions of riverbanks and on muddy portions of the seashore. It is a pioneering species, being one of the first to colonise new ground. Its widespread root system with large numbers of pneumatophores helps to stabilise new deposits of sediment. Biology Because it is difficult for seedlings to become established in tide-swept muddy habitats, A. alba exhibits cryptovivipary. The embryos start to develop and break through the coat of the seeds before the fruits split open to shed the seeds. In some cases, the plant also exhibits vivipary, with the developing shoot breaking through the fruit capsule while it is still growing on the bush. The seedlings have hooked hairs and are often seen growing in tangled groups.Api-api putih Avicennia alba Wild fact sheets. Retrieved 2012-02-09. Ecology A number of invertebrates are associated with A. alba. The larvae of certain small moths, Euopoicillia spp., feed on the flower buds and those of another moth, Autoba alabastrata, feed on the fruits. The leaves are eaten by beetles, Monolepta spp. The greatest number of known species of marine fungi are found growing in mangrove swamps where A. alba is one of a number of species colonised.Species of Higher Marine Fungi University of Mississippi. Retrieved 2012-02-07. Status Mangrove habitats in general are threatened by human activities such as coastal development, agriculture, and the creation of fish ponds. Rising sea levels due to global warming will also affect mangroves communities. A. alba is affected by these threats, but the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists it as being of least concern because it is a fast-growing species, recovers readily from being cut, is widely distributed, and is common over much of its range. Uses A. alba is a fast- growing species and is sometimes planted, along with Sonneratia and Rhizophora, to help prevent coastal erosion. The timber from A. alba does not make good firewood or charcoal, but is used in the smoking of rubber and of fish. An extract of the heartwood is used in herbal medicine to make a tonic, and the resin has been used in birth control. The seeds are boiled and eaten as a vegetable and are sometimes available in local markets.

Administratively, the project is located in the Yamalo- Nenets Autonomous Okrug. The project is developed by Gazprom. History Preparations for the Yamal's development started in the 1990s. According to the original plans, drilling work on the Bovanenkovo field was to have started in 1997. In January 2002, Gazprom identified the Yamal Peninsula as a region of Gazprom's strategic interest. Preparatory works started in 2007 with the construction of auxiliary infrastructures, such as staff buildings and transport facilities. In July 2008 Gazprom launched the construction of the Bovanenkovo‚ÄìUkhta gas trunkline at the submerged crossing via the Baydaratskaya Bay. The project was officially inaugurated on 3 December 2008. Oil and gas fields 11 gas fields and 15 oil, gas and condensate fields have been discovered on the Yamal Peninsula and its adjacent offshore areas. They consist of 16 trillion cubic meters (tcm) of explored and provisionally evaluated gas reserves, and nearly 22 tcm of in-place and forecast gas reserves. Estimated condensate reserves are 230.7 million tonnes; estimated oil reserves are 291.8 million tonnes. The largest gas fields for which Gazprom owns the licenses are the Bovanenkovo, Kharasavey, Novoportovo, Kruzenshtern, Severo-Tambey, Zapadno-Tambey, Tasiy and Malygin fields. =Bovanenkovo gas field= The Bovanenkovo gas field is the largest gas field on the Yamal Peninsula with estimated reserves of 4.9 tcm. It is expected to be put in operation by 2011. Annual production of 8 billion cubic meters (bcm) will increase to 75-115 bcm by 2017. Trunk pipelines Several pipelines are envisaged for delivery of the Yamal gas. A joint project (Yamal-Europe pipeline) between gas transportation companies of Russia, Belarus, Poland and Germany was agreed in 1993 and commissioned in 1999. After commissioning of the Bovanenkovo‚ÄìUkhta gas trunkline it will deliver Yamal's gas to Europe. Construction of this pipeline started in July 2008 and was officially launched on 3 December 2008. The gas pipeline is to connect the Bovanenkovo gas field with the Russian gas hub at Ukhta. First deliveries of over 15 bcm per year were originally expected to start by the end of 2011. Actual pipeline filling with natural gas started on 15 June 2012; operation is expected to start imminently.First Gas Feeds to Bovanenkovo-Ukhta GTS, Natural Gas Europe, retrieved 20 June 2012 Yamal LNG In November 2008, Gazprom announced that it prepares a list of potential partners for the Yamal LNG project. Although the list was not disclosed yet, Gazprom indicated that ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were included on the list. In July 2014 Halliburton was added to this list.

Although he was known as Charles to his contemporaries, his real name may have been Fran√ßois. He was most probably born in Paris, but spent much of his life in London, where he settled sometime after 1702/1703. A prominent member of the Drury Lane musical establishment, Dieupart was active both as composer and performer and actively participated in the musical life of the city. However, after about 1712 he earned his income mostly by teaching, and in his later years lived in poverty. He is best remembered today for a collection of six harpsichord suites which influenced Johann Sebastian Bach's English Suites. Life Details of Dieupart's early life and training are sketchy, and the reason for his emigration to England is unknown. The earliest document to refer to the composer is his own , published in Amsterdam in 1701. He is next heard of on 11 February 1703 in London, when he performed Corelli's music at Drury Lane with Gasparo Visconti. Dieupart settled in London and eventually became an important member of the Drury Lane musical establishment. He collaborated with playwright Peter Anthony Motteux, composer Thomas Clayton, and others; he also participated in performances of music by Italian composers such as Giovanni Bononcini and Domenico Scarlatti.Fuller, Holman, Grove. In late 1707 Dieupart became involved in establishing an operatic project at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket, London. Although he evidently played a significant part in the project, he was dropped by the management after about a year, in late 1708. Dieupart tried organizing a series of concerts at York Buildings in 1711 and 1712, but ended up giving only a few. After 1712 he was mostly active as a teacher, although his music was still performed in concerts until at least 1726, and he was apparently a regular member of the Drury Lane orchestra. Dieupart's last known public appearance was in 1724. According to music historian John Hawkins, whose work is the most important source on Dieupart's biography, the composer died at a very advanced age and in poverty. Music Dieupart's best-known work is (Amsterdam, 1701). As the title indicates, it contains six harpsichord suites. All of them are in seven movements, always with the sequence ouverture ‚Äì allemande ‚Äì courante ‚Äì sarabande ‚Äì gavotte, a menuet or a passepied, and a gigue as the final movement. Some of the movements within a suite are linked thematically. The music represents a highly successful synthesis of French, Italian and English styles, married with imaginative harmony. The same can be said about most of Dieupart's other music, which has been neglected in recent times. The suites were popular even during the composer's lifetime: they were reissued already in 1702, arranged for violin or recorder (voice flute and fourth flute) and basso continuo, and then 13 of the movements were published in London in 1705 as Select Lessons for the Harpsichord or Spinnett. Johann Sebastian Bach copied all six suites sometime between 1709 and 1714,Butt 1997, 140. and was influenced by Dieupart's music, particularly in the famous English Suites. Dieupart's suites may have also inspired Nicolas Siret, whose first book adopts the suite's initial opening as an example.

Crosstalk Mk.4 was one of a suite of products produced by the company; others included the famed Crosstalk XVI, Crosstalk Communicator, Crosstalk for Windows, and Remote 2. Its CASL scripting language, though not the program behind it, was still supported (by Micro Focus) in 2018. Overview Featuring multisession communications capabilities, Crosstalk Mk.4 allowed multiple serial ports to be used and controlled simultaneously. A powerful programming language called CASL (Crosstalk Application Scripting Language) provided full program and communications activity control, and enabled users to create a wide variety of custom applications. The program was in widespread use globally and served the communications and equipment control needs of major conglomerates. The company having been acquired and reacquired, as of 2018 the CASL scripting language is supported by Micro Focus's InfoConnect Desktop offering.

Actually, an earlier, functionally similar product named Crosstalk XVI, had been introduced in 1982. The XVI (16 in Roman numerals) represented the 16-bit processor of the PC; Mk.4 came somewhat later. Digital Communications Associates acquired Microstuf, makers of the Crosstalk Communications package together with their flagship product, the Crosstalk terminal emulation program, in 1986. It was early 1987 when DCA won a look and feel lawsuit regarding Crosstalk. Enhancements (including for Windows) continued into the early 1990s.

Since the creation of an autonomous Wallonia, it is also called Wallonie Picarde, in light of the regional use of the Picard language. Geography The most important city in Wallonie picarde is Tournai which is also the oldest city of the Low countries. The Tournai Cathedral, has been classified both as a Wallonia's major heritage and as a World Heritage Site.Tournai is labelled on Tabula Peutingeriana. Tournai gives its name to the Tournaisian: The ‚ÄúCalcaire de Tournai‚Äù comprises the limestone formations cropping out in the M√©lantois-Tournaisis Anticline (...) which have been quarried since the Roman conquest. Its relationship with the succession of the Dinant area was only understood following study of the Asile d‚ÄôAli√©n√©s borehole at Tournai and the Vieux-Leuze borehole at Leuze [...] These boreholes exhibited a rather typical middle Tournaisian succession below the ‚ÄúCalcaire de Tournai‚Äù that was easy to correlate with the succession of the Dinant area.Luc Hance, Edouard Poty, Fran√ßois-Xavier Devuyst Tournaisian in Geologica Belgica (2006) 9/1-2: 47-53 The largest find of Iguanodon remains to date occurred in 1878 in a coal mine at Bernissart, at a depth of 322 m (1056 ft).

The square is grassed over and is a traditional Georgian park. The square is in Leeds' financial quarter and is surrounded by Georgian buildings, which are occupied as offices, many by barristers and solicitors. History St Paul's House from the square Vicarage Chambers Park Square was part of a fashionable West End housing development, known as the Park Estates which was developed at the end of the eighteenth century for the upwardly mobile wealthy, to give them some distance from industry and the river, but within easy reach of the commercial centre. It was laid out from 1788, being completed in its original form in 1810 with houses 'well built in the modern tradition'. Somewhat grander dwellings were available in nearby Park Place. In naming the area, the word 'street' was avoided in favour of terms such as 'Row', 'Parade', 'Place' and 'Square', considered more prestigious, as had already been done in Georgian developments such as Bath, Bloomsbury and Bristol. It featured a private garden square and a church, St Paul's, on the south side which offered exclusive pew and interment rights to the residents. However the initial aim of a purely residential area was not maintained when a large warehouse and cloth cutting works, St Paul's House, was built in 1878 for ready-made mass production tailor John Barran on St Paul's Street, with its rear aspect effectively taking up half the south side of the square. This was, however, in grand Arabic-Saracenic style by architect Thomas Ambler, and notable as the first planned and designed clothing factory. The building was modernized and converted to offices in 1977, with a new main entrance on Park Square South. The other half of the south side of the square was taken up by St Paul's Church, (built 1793, demolished 1906). In 1938 Rivers House (21 Park Square South) was built on the site in Neo-Georgian style as offices for the Water Board. It is now private flats: Park Square Residences. Number 9, Park Square East is Vicarage Chambers, being on the site of the former vicarage of St Paul's Church. For much of the 20th century a major feature was a bronze statue by Alfred Drury (1895) of Circe who changed the companions of Odysseus into swine, shown around her feet.

Francis Schnadhorst (24 August 1840 ‚Äì 2 January 1900) was a Birmingham draper and English Liberal Party politician. He briefly held elected office on Birmingham Council, and was offered the chance to stand for Parliament in winnable seats, but he found his true metier was in political organisation and administration both in his home town as secretary of the highly successful Birmingham Liberal Association from 1867 to 1884, and nationally as secretary of the newly formed National Liberal Federation from 1877 to 1893. He was famously described as \\"the spectacled, sallow, sombre\\" Birmingham draper who within a short period of time was to establish himself through the Birmingham Liberal caucus as one of the most brilliant organisers in the country.Quoted in Family and education Francis Schnadhorst was the son of a draper and hosier of German descent.Taylor 2013. who carried on business in Bull Street, Birmingham.The Times, 5 January 1900. His father died when he was very young and he was brought up by his mother and his paternal grandfather who owned a tailoring business in Moor Street. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham.James Dodsley, The Annual Register; 1901 p. 99. Career When Schnadhorst was sixteen his grandfather died, and Francis took over the family business. However, like many Victorian tradesman and ardent nonconformists, he was keenly interested in improving himself and his town. He involved himself in the civic life of Birmingham. He served as secretary to the Central Nonconformist Committee set up in Birmingham to oppose Church influence in education. He was also an active member of a number of Birmingham civic and local improvement societies. Through these groups and the close connection between nonconformity, self-help and Liberalism, Schnadhorst was drawn into political activity for the Liberal Party. PoliticsBirmingham= Before the end of the 19th century the Liberal party's championing of reform and improvement had created in Birmingham a model of civic government. The 1885 Redistribution Act created seven single-member constituencies, more than doubling Birmingham's representation in Parliament. A Royal decree declared the corporation of the City of Birmingham in 1889 and the first Lord Mayor was elected in 1896. The local Liberal Party was compelled to rethink its structure in response to this civic expansion, and in anticipation of the additional electors enfranchised by the 1867 Reform Act. The Birmingham Liberal Association was established in 1865, and radically reorganised by its secretary, William Harris, in 1868: Schnadhorst succeeded Harris as secretary in 1873.McGill 1962. Membership was open to anyone able to pay the one shilling annual fee, meaning that political participation was no longer the preserve of the traditional ruling classes. In 1868 the Association had 400 members, but by 1886 it had become known as \\"the Two Thousand\\". Its existence enabled the Liberals to fight general, town council and school board elections more effectively and successfully. This party structure was what subsequently became known, both locally and nationally, as the Liberal Caucus ‚Äì a name initially coined by detractors as a term of abuse, but afterwards adopted by the Liberals themselves. As an example of political efficiency the Caucus could not be rivalled,Rodrick, op. cit., p. 141. and this was due in large part to Schnadhorst's administrative abilities. Schnadhorst first became involved in political activity at the Birmingham election of 1867 when he took on the roles of vice-chairman and secretary to the St. George's Ward Liberal committee. He was himself briefly a member of the Council for St Mary's Ward in 1872, but was most effective as secretary of the Birmingham Liberal Association from 1873 onwards. The Liberals had already been electorally successful in Birmingham, particularly at the 1868 general election, but Schnadhorst bolstered the party's organisation to oust the Conservative and Anglican majorities on the town council and the school board. Joseph Chamberlain may have provided the political leadership to make Birmingham the \\"gas and water\\" socialist capital of Victorian civic life, but behind the scenes Schnadhorst was \\"the organising genius of the Birmingham association\\". =The chance of a Parliamentary seat= Before the 1885 general election, Schnadhorst was invited to stand in two Birmingham seats, South and East, both of which were subsequently won by the Liberals. However he did not wish to enter Parliament. He said he felt he could better promote the cause of Liberalism through his administrative work for the party. In 1890 he also turned down the offer of a seat in Newcastle-under-Lyme but by this time his health was deteriorating; he had already had to have some time off work on medical advice and had undertaken a holiday voyage to Australia a few years earlier. =National Liberal Federation= In 1877, along with Joseph Chamberlain and William Harris, Schnadhorst was instrumental in the establishment of the National Liberal Federation (NLF), and became its first secretary (with Chamberlain as president, and Harris as chairman). The Federation, which was set up for educational and propagandist purposes and co- ordinated the work of the several hundred Liberal associations in England and Wales, became a great political force and was largely responsible for Liberal victories of 1880, 1885, and 1892. In recognition of his services to the Liberal Party, Schnadhorst was presented with 10,000 guineas and an address at a banquet in 1887, following the removal of the National Liberal Federation from Birmingham to London.http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/cgi- bin/deadsearch.cgi?serverid=VSPOKES-ead- birminghamspcoll&bool;=AND&numreq;=1&fieldcont1;=173&format;=full&fieldidx1;=docid&scanposition;=middle&firstrec;=1&noframes;=on The formation of the NLF was the most important development in Liberal Party organisation after the 1874 general election which had seen the Liberals lose office and Benjamin Disraeli return to Number 10 Downing Street. The NLF held an annual conference which was regarded as being representative of the opinion of the party's rank and file.Tony Little, The Newcastle Programme at the Liberal Democrat History Group website http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=30&item;=history Chamberlain described it as \\"a really Liberal Parliament...elected by universal suffrage and with some regard for fair distribution of political power\\".Quoted in split in the Liberal Party over Irish Home Rule. His luggage includes a scroll marked \\"Caucus\\"; a number of string puppets; and a box of \\"wire pulling machinery\\". In 1884 Schnadhorst resigned his post of secretary of the Birmingham Liberal Association to concentrate full-time on the NLF. As secretary, he became the link between the leadership and the constituency associations and hence the key figure in rebuilding the party following the split over Irish Home Rule and the defection of the Liberal Unionists. One of Schnadhorst's jobs was to provide speakers who would draw crowds at Liberal rallies and it was William Ewart Gladstone who addressed the inaugural meeting of the NLF at Bingley Hall, Birmingham in 1877. Schnadhorst's achievement in keeping the NLF Gladstonian rather than Chamberlainite in 1886, when the party split on the issue of Irish Home Rule and Birmingham followed Chamberlain into the Liberal Unionist fold, was of considerable importance to the Liberal Party. He reorganised the NLF to make it more responsive to the needs of local associations, so encouraging affiliations. In 1886, he also agreed to become the secretary of the Liberal Central Association, and revolutionised the Association's conduct of elections, the improvements being reflected in a series of favourable by-election results at the end of the 1880s. =Liberal Central Association= On 21 February 1860 twenty Liberal MPs had formed the Liberal Registration Association to promote general co-operation between MPs and assisting in the process of registering electors in constituencies where the Liberals were not well-organised. It changed its name to the Liberal Central Association in 1874 and re-modelled its structure and purpose to become the \\"central medium of communication with and between the Party throughout the whole kingdom in aid of and in connection with local organisation\\". The chairman of the LCA was originally the Leader of the Liberal MPs but by the end of the 19th century it was the Liberal Chief Whip. As the 19th century wore on, the role of the LCA changed from that of a members' association to that of a Liberal Whips' Office. It put local Liberal Associations in touch with potential candidates and made grants of money to help with elections. It had no policy role but supporters of various factions within the party did try to capture the offices of the LCA from time to time, most notably in the dissensions in the party over imperialism. =Resignation= Schnadhorst undertook other public duties, chairing Liberal meetings and rallies and in connection with campaigns and causes promoted by the Liberal Party. For example, he was elected one of the Vice-Presidents of the Free Land League in 1886.The Times, 30 September 1886. However, he resigned all party offices in 1893,Who was Who, OUP 2007. almost certainly due to declining health, even though he was still only 53 years old. His achievement was recognised in many quarters and he earned the description in the publication Who's Who as the \\"chief organiser and adviser of the Liberal party, 1885‚Äì1892\\". Ill-health and death Schnadhorst died at the Priory Hospital, described in the terminology of the day as a lunatic asylum, at Roehampton on 2 January 1900. He had been in declining health since the early 1890s. In 1894 he had suffered a mental breakdown leading to years of illness, including the suffering of convulsions. In December 1899 he was confined to bed and he never recovered. He also suffered increasingly from deafness as he got older. His funeral was held at Putney Cemetery on 6 January 1900.The Times, 9 January 1900. Personal life Schnadhorst was married to Mary Anne Thomas (1845/6‚Äì1912), daughter of Edward Thomas, a Birmingham provision merchant. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Their youngest son, Frank Gladstone SchnadhorstThe Malvern Register, 1865‚Äì1904, 1905.

The company produces frozen Yorkshire puddings, potato products, meal accompaniments, ready meals, vegetables and desserts. The company has its factories in Hull and employs over 350 staff. Since 2010, food manufacturer Symington's in Leeds has manufactured many of the Aunt Bessie's branded mixes and stuffings on behalf of the company.  History  Aunt Bessie's Limited is a subsidiary to the William Jackson Food Group, a food retail and manufacturing business founded in Hull in 1851. The current chairman, Nicholas Oughtred, is the great-great grandson of the founder, William Jackson. The William Jackson Group's frozen Yorkshire puddings were originally created for Butlins Holiday Camps in 1974. In 1995 the company started producing its Yorkshire puddings for British supermarket chains under the label Aunt Bessie's, so a special food manufacturing company was set up, called Tryton Foods. Its name was taken from The Triton Inn at Brantingham, which then was part of the William Jackson group and noted for its Yorkshire puddings. Aunt Bessie's frozen roast potatoes were introduced in 1999 and were one of a number of products including chips and croquettes that had been manufactured under licence by Heinz at their factory in Norfolk until the contract for the deal ended in 2015. By 2001 the retail value of the brand was over ¬£50 million and it had become one of the top 100 brands in Britain. As the fastest growing frozen food brand its value had grown to ¬£110 million by 2014 and in consumer surveys it had a recognition score of 70%. In August 2004, the supermarket division of the William Jackson company, Jacksons Stores, based in North Ferriby, was sold to Sainsbury's for ¬£100 million, and the company began to focus on food production rather than retail. In early 2008, sales of the Aunt Bessie's Homestyle mashed potato doubled when it featured in Delia Smith's How to Cheat at Cooking for use in a shepherd's pie. The same year, the company name was changed to Aunt Bessie's Ltd. In its list of Britain's biggest brands, The Grocer ranked Aunt Bessie's at 50 in 2016 and 55 in 2017.

A typical IP access controller supports 2 or 4 basic access control readers. It may have an internal web server and support configuration via a browser or via software installed on a host PC. The main features that distinguish IP controllers from older generation of serial controllers are: # IP controllers connect directly to LAN/WAN and have all the inputs and outputs necessary for controlling readers, monitoring door inputs and controlling locks. # IP controllers connect directly to LAN/WAN and have all the inputs and outputs necessary focontrollters have an on-board network interface and does not require the use of a terminal server. Examples of IP access controllers are GC01n by Simac/SimacQuadCore, PAC-512-IP by PAC/Stanley Security Products, DirectDoor by GE Security Products and VertX V2000 by HID Global. Advantages and disadvantages of IP controllers Advantages: * An existing network infrastructure is fully utilized; there is no need to install new communication lines. * There are no limitations regarding the number of IP controllers in a system (the limit of 32 controllers per line is typical for systems using RS-485 communication interface). * Special knowledge of installation, termination, grounding and troubleshooting of RS-485 communication lines is not required. * Communication with IP controllers may be done at the full network speed, which is important if transferring a lot of data (databases with thousands of users, possibly including biometric records). * In case of an alarm IP controllers may initiate connection to the host PC. This ability is important in large systems as it allows reducing network traffic generated by frequent polling. * Simplifies installation of systems consisting of multiple locations separated by large distances. Basic Internet link is sufficient to establish connections to remote locations. * Wide selection of standard network equipment is available to provide connectivity in different situations (fiber, wireless, VPN, dual path, PoE) * No special hardware is required for building fail-over systems: in case the primary host PC fails, the secondary host PC may start polling IP controllers. Disadvantages: * The system becomes susceptible to network related problems, such as delays in case of heavy traffic and network equipment failures. * IP controllers and workstations may become accessible to hackers if the network of an organization is not well protected. This threat may be eliminated by physically separating the access control network from the network of the organization. Also most IP controllers utilize either Linux platform or proprietary operating systems, which makes them more difficult to hack. Industry standard data encryption is also used. * Maximum distance from a hub or a switch to the controller is . * Operation of the system is dependent on the host PC. In case the host PC fails, events from IP controllers are not retrieved and functions that require interaction between readers (i.e. anti- passback) stop working. Some controllers, however, have peer-to-peer communication option in order to reduce dependency on the host PC. * Unlike IP readers, most IP controllers do not support PoE. This, however, may change if the PoE technology is improved to deliver more power, or low-power controllers and locks are introduced. Based on the current PoE standards power that can be carried by a single network cable is enough for one IP reader and an electric strike or a magnetic lock, but connecting an IP controller and 2 or more electric locks would require more power than available via PoE.

The majority of the buildings in the central cadet area are historic. Geography the Plain West Point is located approximately north of New York City on the western bank of the Hudson River. The Academy's geographic location and geologic formations have directly shaped its history. There wouldn't even be a military garrison at West Point were it not for the narrow \\"s-curve\\" in the river, literally creating a \\"west point\\" in the river that was so prominent and important for controlling shipping traffic on the Hudson during colonial times. In addition to the narrow double-90-degree turns, the currents and winds were erratic and unpredictable, making even an unopposed navigation difficult. In addition to the strategic shape of the Hudson River, the Highlands rise up sharply from river level to at some places in the immediate area. The combination of the narrow river turns and the commanding high ground made this place the perfect location for the Continental Army to build its stronghold against British troop movement into upstate New York during the American Revolution. The Continental Army first occupied the relatively level plain and constructed Fort Clinton and supporting redoubts and batteries of artillery on prominent hills in the area and across the river on Constitution Island. Guests of cadets who visit Flirtation Walk can experience glimpses of the Revolutionary War era terrain as the shoreline along the river below the plain has not changed much in over 200 years. It wasn't until after the war that congress actually purchased the land upon where Fort Clinton stood. In 1790, Congress purchased an initial tract of from a Stephen Moore of North Carolina.Lange, p.3 Crow's Nest is the highest point on the reservation For the first hundred years of the Academy, ship-board traffic, then later rail- traffic, were the only ways to access West Point from New York City. In the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, the Hudson Highlands surrounding West Point were sparsely populated and often harbored \\"gangs of thieves\\".Forman pp. 2‚Äì3 An 1819 letter from superintendent Sylvanus Thayer complained to the Secretary War John C. Calhoun of the lawlessness of the local inhabitants in the highlands surrounding West Point.Lange, pp 1‚Äì2 As transportation technology improved and coal became the dominant source of energy consumption, the wildness of the highlands subsided and the hill people whose lives were linked to subsistence upon the forest began to disappear. By the turn of the century, the Academy had begun to expand beyond the immediate reaches of the Plain and grew both south along the river and westward into the highlands.Lange, p. 2 History The entire central post was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960, but none of the occupied structures on post date to the Revolutionary War period. The oldest surviving buildings are the residences of the Superintendent and the Commandant. Local legend states that one of the foundation walls of the Warner House on Constitution Island dates to the revolutionary war period, but that has never been verified through documentation. Through much of the first 150 years, progress superseded historical preservation as the norm at the academy and many of the most historically significant and grand structures of the \\"old academy\\" were demolished to make way for newer and more functionally modern structures. =Revolutionary war structures & sites= Fort Putnam The garrison at West Point originally centered on Fort Clinton, the Great Chain, and the defenses built upon Constitution Island. Many of the revolutionary war fortifications still dot the more remote landscape of the academy grounds. Some have been nearly fully restored, such as Fort Putnam, while some have been partially restored, such as Redoubt 4, and some are almost completely reduced to little more than historical markers, such as Fort Clinton. Numerous redoubts were constructed in support of Fort Clinton. Those who survive to present day were fortunate to be in hard-to-reach places that did not impede in the expansion of the academy. Redoubts that are long since lost to time and progress included several in the vicinity of the Warner House on Constitution island, and two small outposts near the present day Lusk Reservoir housing area. In the academy's first one hundred years or so, there was little thought given to preserving these historical fortifications as the remains of Ft. Clinton fell into disrepair and were eventually demolished and some of the smaller redoubts were scavenged for their stone or razed to make room for other structures. One of the more notable remaining Revolutionary War sites is Kosciuszko's Garden, which sits on the east-facing cliff side about below present day Cullum Hall.Lange, p. 8 Immediately after the war's conclusion, Revolutionary War-era barracks and quarters served the academic mission of the fledgling academy. Records of these structures have been lost to time and a fire in 1838. =Historical academy structures of significance that no longer exist= The Plain in 1828. The barracks, academic building, & mess hall from this painting are long since demolished and Wood's Monument is moved to the West Point Cemetery In 1808, six years after the formal founding of the academy, Congress authorized the expansion of the Corps of Cadets from only a handful to nearly 300. Along with this increase in personnel came the funding to house them. The first formal set of barracks were constructed in 1815 and 1817 and were known as North and South Barracks. These structures housed the Corps of Cadets until they were replaced and demolished in the early 1850s. The main academic building, known simply as \\"the Academy\\", was also constructed in 1815. These three buildings are depicted in the 1828 painting by George Catlin to the left. On 19 February 1838, a fire destroyed the original academic building and most of the academy's records. The replacement of the original \\"academy\\", was constructed on the site of present-day Pershing Barracks in 1839 and remained in use until 1891. This academic building was three levels tall and multipurpose, with a large open floor plan on the ground floor that doubled as a riding hall during the winter months.Lange, p.12 In 1829, the West Point Hotel was built on the eastern edge of Trophy Point. The hotel would stand overlooking the Hudson River for a century until it was demolished in the early 1930s, several years after the construction of the Thayer Hotel. In 1841, superintendent Richard Delafield oversaw the construction of the old cadet library and observatory, which stood at the intersection of Cullum Road and Jefferson Place near present-day Cullum Hall and the second cadet library. That library stood on the southern edge of the Plain for 119 years before it was demolished in 1960. That library was built in the style known as Tudor Gothic and helped set the tone of future buildings on the edge of the plain. The offices of the Superintendent, Adjutant, Quartermaster, & Treasurer were in the library until the new Headquarters was built in 1870.Lange, p. 14 The old library's observatory had to be moved up the hill near Lusk Reservoir when a train tunnel was constructed under the Plain in 1880. The observatory stood at the top of the hill above the cadet chapel until it was closed and demolished in the 1950s. In 1851, Delafield oversaw a major overhaul in the barracks conditions with the construction of more modern barracks, built in the \\"division\\" style that is still prevalent in the older remaining barracks on post. These barracks, known as \\"Old Central Barracks\\" remained in use for over 100 years before being demolished in the 1960s. Today, only the 1st Division remains, standing as a monument in the cadet central area, preserved as \\"Nininger Hall\\", which houses the Cadet Honor Committee.Lange, p. 15 The Richard Morris Hunt-designed gymnasium which occupied the site of present-day Washington Hall The \\"Old Cadet Mess Hall\\" was built on the site of the current Grant Hall in 1852 and served as the dining hall for the Corps of Cadets until it was replaced by Washington Hall and demolished in 1930 to make way for the current Grant Hall.Lange, p 16 In 1852, Delafield oversaw the construction of the Commandant's headquarter's building and cadet guardhouse on the site of present-day Bradley Barracks. This building helped encircle the cadet \\"central area\\", which is similar to the courtyard known in present-day as \\"Central Area\\". The Commandant's office was demolished in 1920.Lange, p.16 The Commandant's offices are on the 4th floor of Washington Hall overlooking the Plain. On the site of present-day Thayer Hall, on the lower rises of the cliffs along the Hudson, the Old Riding Hall was constructed beginning in 1855. The structure was known as the largest equestrian riding hall in the US during its day.Lange, p.17 This hall stood on the cliff below the Plain until being demolished for a new riding hall in 1908.Miller, p.54 In 1870, the new academy headquarters building was constructed on the site of present-day Taylor Hall. Meant to house the Superintendent and other academy leadership and staff, this building was too small and inadequate shortly after construction and it was demolished shortly after 1900 to make way for the construction of Taylor Hall.Lange, p.19 A cadet hospital was constructed in 1884 on the site of present-day Lee Barracks. In 1923, a new wing of the hospital was built, which now houses the Office of Admissions. The main hospital building was demolished in 1960 to make way for Lee Barracks.Lange, p.20 In the late 1880s Richard Morris Hunt was contracted to design several buildings. The first was a gymnasium, begun in 1891 in a Romanesque Revival design with two large towers flanking a grand arched entrance. The gymnasium was opened in 1893 and used until the early 1920s, when it was demolished to make way for the new mess hall, Washington Hall.Lange, p. 22 =Structures from the 19th century still in use in the academic area= Superintendent's Quarters (1820), one of the oldest remaining building on post The Superintendent's quarters (1820) and the Commandant's quarters (1821) were constructed on the end of Jefferson Place near the intersection with Washington Road. During the 1800s, Jefferson Road extended further south through what is now North Area and a row of officers' quarters once lined the west side of the road south of the Superintendent's quarters, but those structures were all demolished to make room for the old North Barracks. The next oldest structures on post are the three sets of large duplex officers' quarters just off the northwest edge of the plain. These quarters (c1828), have been expanded over the years and have come to be known as Professor's Row, as they traditionally house the heads of the academic departments. The Dean's quarters were constructed in 1856 between the commandant's quarters and professor's row. A complex of structures known as the \\"Ordnance Compound\\" was completed between 1837 and 1840. It consisted of three stone buildings with two towers encircled by a wall. The building that stands in the center of the compound, now the First Class Cadet's social club, was added in 1880.Lange, p. 13 The second academic building was demolished in 1891 and replaced on the same location by what was then known as the West Academic Building. This Richard Morris Hunt designed structure took four years to complete and served as the main academic hall until 1950, when it was converted into a barracks and renamed Pershing Barracks. The large house on the end of Professor's Row, known today as the \\"Beat Navy House\\" due to the \\"Beat Navy Sign\\" that hangs on its front porch, was built in 1875 and has been used as multiple officer's quarters since its construction. In 1894, McKim, Mead, and White designed and began construction on the new memorial hall, later named Cullum Hall after General George W. Cullum, who started the Cullum Register of Graduates and donated the funds for the structure. Completed in 1898, Cullum Hall broke several architectural traditions. First its classical design and white marble construction clashed with the gray granite Gothic design of the other buildings on the plain. Second, it obstructed the eastern view of the Hudson River.Lange, p. 24 Started in 1900 and completed in 1903, the West Point Officer's Club also was of neo-classical design. However, budget cuts and the high cost of white marble resulted in the selection of an off-color white brick, a design that failed to inspire the imagination of the public at large and the academy leadership. These two structures are the only neo-classical designs left in the cadet area now that the old cadet chapel is moved to the cemetery.Lange, p. 25 =1903 design competition= The academic area before the 1903 design completion construction. After the turn of the century, as West Point approached its centennial, it became apparent that the campus was in need of a facilities overhaul and was lacking a clear design plan and architectural style. A major competition was held to design a major renovation of the campus, to include building a new cadet barracks (North Barracks, since demolished), chapel (the Cadet Chapel), academic building (Bartlett Hall), post headquarters (Taylor Hall), bachelor's officer quarters (Lincoln Hall), riding hall (Thayer Hall), and hotel (later the Thayer Hotel). In addition to all the construction, the winning bid had to cost less than $5,000,000.Lange, p26 After a lengthy competition, the firm of Cram, Goodhue, & Furgeson (CGF) was selected to overhaul the academy's facilities. Nearly all of their works still stand, and their designs have influenced all other works in the cadet area since.Lange, p. 29 Hayes gym in 1910 The first buildings completed by CGF was the heating plant and riding hall, completed along the cliffs of the Hudson in 1909. The massive riding hall rises from the cliffs along the river to the level of the Plain. This structure served as the home of equestrian instruction until riding was removed from the curriculum during World War II. In 1958, the hall's interior was completely renovated and converted into an academic hall, renamed Thayer Hall in honor of Sylvanus Thayer. Now containing four interior floors and a large auditorium, it is considered the main academic hall on campus. In 1910, CGF completed construction of the new Headquarters building, later named Taylor Hall in honor of Maxwell Taylor. Hayes Gymnasium was also constructed by CGF and completed in 1910, replacing the Richard Morris Hunt-designed gymnasium that would be demolished to make way for the new mess hall in 1920. The \\"crown jewel\\" of CGF's project was unquestionably the new West Point Cadet Chapel, set high on the hillside above the cadet area, and completed in 1910. Upon completion of the Cadet Chapel, the Old Cadet Chapel was deconstructed and moved to the cemetery in 1911. The granite used for the construction of the Cadet Chapel was quarried from the hillside behind Hayes gymnasium, practically at the construction site.Lange, p.30 In 1913, CGF completed Bartlett Hall as one of the main academic buildings. The dirt and debris from the construction of Bartlett Hall was used to fill in \\"execution hollow\\", a large depression located on the Plain near Trophy Point. Two of CGF's buildings that have not stood the test of time were the North Barracks, which were later demolished to make way for the current MacArthur Barracks, and the cadet guardhouse, located in North Area and later demolished to make way for Scott Barracks. =Gradual expansion, 1920‚Äì1960= After the 1903 design competition, pace of new construction at the academy slowed, but there were continual updates. Started in 1925 and completed by 1929, Washington Hall, named in honor of George Washington, became the new cadet mess hall. Designed by Arnold Brunner, Washington Hall can rightfully be considered the \\"center\\" of the cadet academic area. Due to large increase in the size of the Corps of Cadets, more barracks space was needed in the early 1930s. In 1931, Grant Hall (also called Grant Barracks) was completed on the site of the old cadet mess hall. In 1937, Paul P. Cret completed construction on Scott Barracks in North Area. Cret also oversaw an expansion of Bartlett Hall in 1938. =Major expansion, 1960‚Äìpresent= Mahan in 2003. The large American Elms can be seen on the right. The 100% increase in the size of the Corps of Cadets in the early 1960s led to rapid expansion of facilities at the expense of preserving the historic structures on post. The central barracks, which had stood since 1851, were torn down, save one segment preserved as Nininger Hall, in order to make way for the construction of Bradley and Eisenhower Barracks between 1965 and 1972. Washington Hall was doubled in size and physically connected to Eisenhower and MacArthur Barracks, which had replaced the old North barracks. In 1969 another wing, \\"Mac Short\\", was added to MacArthur barracks. New barracks were also constructed in south area, with Lee Barracks and Sherman Barracks being constructed in the mid 1960s. Jefferson Hall, 2009The final major construction of the twentieth century in the academic area was the construction of Mahan Hall, named after Dennis Hart Mahan. Mahan Hall is home to the academy's Department of Civil & Mechanical Engineering and Department of Systems Engineering. It contains nine levels, over 75 classrooms and laboratories, and holds a lecture hall, Arnold Auditorium, in its south wing. The west entrance to Mahan Hall used to be graced by two enormous English Elm trees that were 180 years old when they succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease in 2004 and had to be removed.Historic elms had to be removed USMA Dept of Public Works press release, originally published article in Pointer View, 25 June 2004 retrieved 12-17-08] The most recent major construction in the academic area was the construction of the Jefferson Hall Library, which opened in 2008 on the south edge of the plain. To help with overcrowding in the cadet area, the first major barracks construction of the 21st century began in 2015 with the construction of the new Davis Barracks at USMA by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District. The state of the art barracks facility is for housing 650 cadets, three in each room. This construction of the Davis Barracks precedes planned renovations of other barracks at USMA to provide better quality living space for all cadets. Current academic halls *Arvin Cadet Physical Development Center (CPDC): Named after former First Captain Carl Robert Arvin, who died in Vietnam, the gymnasium complex houses the Department of Physical Education (DPE). The original core of Arvin CPDC is Hayes Gymnasium, originally constructed in 1910. The old Arvin gym entrance was built onto it in 1934. In 1999, renovation construction tore down over half of the gym. The 1910 and 1934 sections were preserved with the new CPDC opening in 2004. The new CPDC now houses a Center for Physical Development Excellence (CPDC), offices and classrooms for DPE, new basketball, racquetball, rock climbing, survival swimming, boxing & combatives, and physical therapy facilities. *Bartlett Hall: Home to the Departments of Chemistry and Physics, it was originally constructed in 1913 and expanded in 1937. *Hayes Gymnasium ‚Äì see Arvin Cadet Physical Development Center (above) *Jefferson Hall: Named after former president Thomas Jefferson, whose statue stands in the rotunda. The new library learning center, which opened in 2008, is home to the Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) and the Alexander Haig Room. *Lincoln Hall: Formerly the Bachelor Officer's Quarters, it was renovated in 1987 and now houses the Departments of English and Social Sciences. *Old Cadet Library: Completed in 1964 and attached to Bartlett Hall, it served the Corps for over 40 years until the opening of Jefferson Hall in 2008. *Mahan Hall: Completed in 1974, it is named after USMA alumnus Dennis Hart Mahan. Mahan Hall is home to the academy's Department of Civil & Mechanical Engineering and Department of Systems Engineering. *Thayer Hall: Built in 1911 as a riding hall where the cadets were taught horsemanship, in 1958 it was converted into an academic hall containing over 100 classrooms. The cadet bookstore is housed on the fourth floor and there is a large lecture hall, Robinson Auditorium in the south end of the building. The first two floors of Thayer Hall are home to the Departments of History, Mathematics, Behavioral Sciences and Leadership (BS&L;), and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). *Washington Hall: Named for President George Washington, it is the home of the Cadet Mess Hall. The upper floors of Washington Hall are home to the Department of Military Instruction (DMI), the Department of Foreign Languages (DFL), the Department of Geography & Environmental Engineering (G&ENE;), and the Office of the Commandant. Washington Hall was first constructed in 1929. It was doubled in size in 1964 when the Corps expanded to 4,400 cadets. Chapels The military chapel has played a major role in the history of the academy. In fact, attendance at weekly chapel services was mandatory until the early 1970s. The first chapel, now known as the \\"Old Cadet Chapel\\" was first constructed in 1836. It stood on the site now occupied by Bartlett Hall for 74 years until, after completion of the Cadet Chapel, it was deconstructed in 1910 and reconstructed at its current location in the cemetery. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"width:100%\\" ! width=\\"*\\"  Building ! width=\\"*\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Image ! width=\\"*\\"  Constructed ! width=\\"*\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Description ! wdith=\\"*\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Reference - valign=\\"top\\"  Protestant Chapel  align=\\"center\\"  50px  align=\\"center\\"  1910  Constructed in 1910 to replace the original Cadet Chapel built in 1836, the main Cadet Chapel conducts Protestant services and dominates the backdrop of the Plain. align=\\"center\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  Catholic Chapel  align=\\"center\\"  50px  align=\\"center\\"  1899  On the corner of Stoney Lonesome and Washington roads, the picturesque chapel was constructed in 1900, and expanded and re-dedicated in 1933. align=\\"center\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  Jewish Chapel  align=\\"center\\"  50px  align=\\"center\\"  1984  Built in 1984 on Merritt Road, this chapel was the culmination of 20 years of effort of the private West Point Jewish Chapel Fund. align=\\"center\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  Old Cadet Chapel  align=\\"center\\"  50px  align=\\"center\\"  1836  Originally completed in the cadet central area in 1836, graduates paid for the deconstruction and movement of the building in 1911 to the West Point cemetery upon completion of the current Cadet Chapel.

The inner walls of the building are adorned with plaques which bear the name of each general in the American Revolution. The only illegible plaque is that of Benedict Arnold, the vowels and consonants of his name scratched away by generations of unforgiving cadets. align=\\"center\\" } Barracks * Scott Barracks: Named after General Winfield Scott and built in 1938, it is home to cadets from Second and Third Battalions of the Fourth Regiment. It closed in Fall 2013 for extensive renovations and reopened for the 2014-15 academic year, maintaining its distinct \\"division\\" style layout. * Lee Barracks: Home to cadets from Companies D and F of Third Regiment.

Now named after Maxwell Taylor, it is home to the Office of the Superintendent and the Office of the Dean.Palka & Malinowski, p.157. This class example of \\"collegiate gothic\\" architecture sits overlooking the Hudson River to the east. With its tower, it is the tallest all-stone masonry building in the world.Bugle Notes, 86th Edition, 1994, LTC Hulse Ed. * Cullum Hall: A large social hall containing a dance floor and several receiving rooms for formal occasions. Also known as \\"Cullum Memorial Hall,\\" this building contains plaques that include the names of all West Point graduates killed in action from 1812 to the present. These plaques are located in the newly designed Memorial Room, dedicated on 10 November 2014. The lower levels contain the academy's photo studio, along with various club team practice and equipment storage areas. Academy tradition states that Plebes must know that there are \\"340 Lights in Cullum Hall\\". Cullum Hall sits directly across the road from Doubleday Field, where the New York Yankees occasionally played exhibition games in the 1920s;Beyond the Boxscore The National Archives.gov Retrieved 12-18-2008Palka & Malinowski, p.131. cadet legend states that Babe Ruth once hit a home run off the roof of Cullum Hall, a distance of over . This legend is unlikely given that Ruth was left-handed and Cullum Hall sits beyond the left field fence, which would have made Ruth's home run to the opposite field of his power side. * West Point Club: Originally built in 1902 as the Officer's Club and later expanded in 1963 due to a generous gift by the wife of Gen. Palmer Eddy Pierce, class of 1891. The club has named the large second floor dining room the Pierce Room in their honor. * Nininger Hall: The last remaining structure from the old Central Barracks, the \\"1st Division\\" was traditionally home to the highest ranking cadet.

Cemetery The cemetery is situated about 3/4 of a mile north of the main academic area. Formally designated a military cemetery in 1816, it was previously known locally as \\"German Flats\\". The cemetery is the final resting place of many notable military officers and is now the location of the Old Cadet Chapel. Monuments West Point is home to numerous monuments of famous graduates and other military heroes and patriots. Some of the monuments include: * Eisenhower Monument. This statue of former General of the Army and the 34th President of the United States was dedicated in 1983. Designed by Robert L. Dean, class of 1953, it sits atop a pedestal of red granite and looks out over the Plain to the North. * Kosciuszko's Monument. Dedicated in 1828 and designed by John Latrobe, the monument was originally only the base and the column. The statue was added in 1913.Miller, p.134. * MacArthur Monument. This monument commemorates the Medal of Honor-winning former Superintendent and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. Situated on the upper western corner of the Plain next to the north entrance to MacArthur Barracks, the monument consists of a statue of the general surrounded by angled granite walls that bear inscription excerpts from his 1962 Thayer Award address to the Corps of Cadets. * Sedgwick Monument. Erected by former members of his command, this monument commemorates former Union General John Sedgwick and was dedicated 21 Oct 1868. The spurs of the statue freely rotate and legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they should go to the monument in full dress uniform at midnight before the final exam. If they spin the spurs at midnight, they will pass the class. * Thayer Monument. Commemorating the \\"Father of the Military Academy\\", this monument has been located in several locations during the academy's history. It now sits at the northwest corner of the Plain adjacent to the Beat Navy Tunnel. The monument is oriented to the south, overlooking the Plain and the central cadet area. Thayer's statue is the sight of numerous memorials throughout the year as classes return for their reunions. Tradition is for the oldest living graduate of those returning classes to lay a wreath at the foot of the memorial before the alumni review for that weekend. * Washington Monument. Dedicated in 1916, this large statue of George Washington was moved to its current location in front of Washington Hall in 1971 when the cadet mess hall expansion was completed.Poughkeepsie Journal, p.20.

Projects  Dennen co-founded the mobile blogging platform Moblog, formerly MoblogUK, in November 2003. Commercial users of the service have included Ronan Keating, Bloc Party, Greenpeace, Elbow, Imogen Heap, Max Clifford, Channel 4, Oxfam, Amnesty International and Comic Relief. The service gained prominence in 2005 when Eliot Ward uploaded a photo to the site from one of the London Underground bombings. Dennen responded to the terrorist attacks on London's public transport system by creating the website We're Not Afraid. The site's message was one of a public uniting against terrorism by refusing to sacrifice freedom in response to fear. Within days of the bombings, around 3,500 images had been submitted to the site. The site was the subject of a BBC documentary and coverage included Sky News, Channel 5, ABC's World News Tonight and The New York Times. Dennen's Stopped Clocks project attempts to collate images of stopped public clocks and campaign to get them working again. The campaign has featured on BBC News, London Tonight and The One Show. In 2008, Dennen launched two art projects involving the creation of map-based images using mobile photography and GPS tracking. The first, in October 2008, was a treasure hunt around London to find photographs by James Nachtwey. Run in conjunction with the think tank Demos and XDRTB.org, the competition raised awareness of XDRTB. The second project, Britglyph, invited people from across the UK to build a nationwide geoglyph, placing rocks at specific locations around the country and uploading photos of themselves doing so. The image was based on John Harrison's Chronometer. On 31 August 2012 Dennen re-launched the Big Art Mob project and was given control of the project from previous administrators Channel 4. The Big Art Mob in its new incarnation shifted focus from mapping the United Kingdom's Public Art to mapping the whole world's.  Awards  Moblog collaborated with Channel 4 on the Big Art Mob, which won the On The Move Award at the Royal Television Society Innovation Awards 2007. It was described as \\"a creative project that encourages almost everyone to get involved... a large-scale example of television production in your pocket. Anyone can become a contributor or commentator, as long as they‚Äôve got a mobile camera phone.\\" It also won the MediaGuardian's innovation award for community engagement in 2008. It also received 3 BAFTA nominations across the interactive and mobile categories in 2008. Moblog also collaborated with ShoZu on Britglyph, which won the Experimental and Innovation Award at the Webbys 2009. On 14 August 2009 the Arts Council and LOCOG announced that Dennen's Bus.Tops project, in collaboration with Paula Le Dieu, was Shortlisted for the London award in the Artists Taking The Lead Public Art competition. The project was awarded a ¬£5,000 development grant to further develop the project in competition with 4 other shortlisted artists for a ¬£500,000 award to create a new work of public art in London. On 22 October 2009 the Arts Council announced that the Bus-Tops project had won the competition.

In the United States, the term is frequently used in connection with employees and employment.

For example, discrimination based on antisemitism may relate to religion, national origin, or both; discrimination against a pregnant woman might be based on sex, marital status, or both. United States U.S. federal law protects individuals from discrimination or harassment based on the following nine protected classes: sex, race, age, disability, color, creed, national origin, religion, or genetic information (added in 2008). Many state laws also give certain protected groups special protection against harassment and discrimination, as do many employer policies.

Players must pass the bomb from hand to hand to avoid being blown up but, in order to do this, they must say a new word. This word must contain letters from a card which is turned to start the round. For example, if the letters are KE then the word might be keep or spike. Thirteen rounds are played and the player who has lost the fewest lives is the winner.

Christmas tree stands appeared as early as 1876 and have had various designs over the years. Those stands designed for natural trees have a water-well, which, in many cases may not hold enough water to adequately supply the cut tree. Some specialty Christmas tree stands have value on the secondary antiques market. History Christmas tree stands have been around at least since 1876, when Arthur's Illustrated Home Magazine suggested connecting a Christmas tree stand into a stand for flowers. In that same year, Hermann Albrecht of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania received and as two of the first Christmas tree stand patents issued in the United States.patft.uspto.gov.

In the center of this Is a hole into which to fasten the tree. In 1919, an American monthly magazine Popular Science touted a new type of Christmas-tree stand. The stand featured a broad, cone-shaped base that included an inlet for water and the Christmas tree trunk. Water placed in the galvanized iron shell would give considerable weight to the stand to steady the tree. Once the tree trunk was inserted into the water inlet, the tree would be kept fresh and green much longer than without the water supply. Design Christmas tree stands designed for natural Christmas trees often have a water-well in them; natural trees require water so that they do not dry out.Sandbeck, Ellen.

In 1623, he authored the third known English Language dictionary,The full title was The English Dictionarie, or, An Interpreter of Hard English Words and the first to contain the title \\"dictionary\\". Life Little is known about Cockeram beyond the fact that he authored this work.Blank, p. 174 From the various dedications in his works, it is apparent that he lived in Exeter, England, where contemporary records suggest that he could be the Henrye Cockram who married Elizabethe Strashley, on 2 February 1613. The dedications and prefixes on the first edition show a friendship with John Webster, the playwright, who wrote: Cockeram's dictionary was not intended to be an exhaustive list of words and definitions. As he states on the title page of his first edition, it was to aid \\"[l]adies and Gentlewomen, young Schollers, Clarkes, Merchants, as also Strangers of any Nation, to the understanding of the more difficult Authors already printed in our Language\\". In terms of sources for his work, Cockeram turned to John Bullokar, who authored another dictionary, the English Expositor, in 1616. It is almost certain that Cockeram took many of his definitions from a Dutchman, known only as A. M., who translated Oswald Gaebelkhover's famous medical journal, Boock of Physicke, from Dutch into English.Riddell, pp. 226‚Äì227 James A. Riddell gives evidence that other sources likely to have been used include Thomas Dekker's The Strange Horse Race of 1613. Cockeram went through the book, locating words that could be included, and when he found a word that was used in Robert Cawdrey's Table Alphbeticall (the first known dictionary of English), he copied Cawdrey's definition. Cockeram acknowledged the use of other lexicographers on the title page of his dictionary; on one edition, it said that the work was \\"a Collection of the choicest words contained in the Table Alphabeticall and the English Expositor, and of some thousand of words never published by any heretofore\\". Despite this, he translated or Anglicised a number of words, shown in the Oxford English Dictionary, which attributes the source of approximately 600 words to Cockeram's dictionary. The dictionary was a general success, and did not meet with much contemporary criticism. It went through eleven editions between 1623 and 1658, and until 1656, Bullokar's English Expositor was its only rival.

The victims of this violence were people identified as being associated with the Reign of Terror ‚Äì followers of Robespierre and Marat, and members of local Jacobin clubs. The violence was perpetrated primarily by those whose relatives or associates had been victims of the Great Terror, or whose lives and livelihoods had been threatened by the government and its supporters before the Thermidorean Reaction. Principally these were, in Paris, the Muscadins, and in the countryside, monarchists, supporters of the Girondins, those who opposed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and those otherwise hostile to the Jacobin political agenda.Denis Woronoff, The Thermidorean regime and the Directory, CUP (1972), p. 23. The Great Terror had been largely an organised political programme, based on laws such as the Law of 22 Prairial, and enacted through official institutions such as the Revolutionary Tribunal, but the White Terror was essentially a series of uncoordinated attacks by local activists who shared common perspectives but no central organisation.Alfred Cobban, A History of Modern France vol 1 1715‚Äì1799 Penguin (1957), p. 243. In particular locations, there were however more organised counter-revolutionary movements such as the Companions of Jehu in Lyon and the Companions of the Sun in Provence. The name 'White Terror' derives from the white cockades worn in the hats of royalists.John Paxton, Companion to the French Revolution, Facts on File Publications (1988), p. 207. Background The Reign of Terror ended on 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794) when Robespierre and his associates were overthrown.John Paxton, Companion to the French Revolution, Facts on File Publications (1988), p. 186. However, there was not an immediate reaction to his rule, and for many months an unstable political climate prevailed before a new order emerged. In Paris, there were increasing attacks on sans-culottes by Muscadins, and there were attacks on Jacobins in Lyon and Nimes in February 1795. However, only when a number of conditions changed did anti-Jacobin forces feel sufficiently confident to escalate these attacks into a full-scale White Terror.The Thermidorian regime and the Directory 1794‚Äì1799, CUP (1972), p. 23. Politically, the Thermidorean Reaction did not remove from power all those who had been involved in the Reign of Terror ‚Äì indeed some of the most feared Terrorists, including Jean-Baptiste Carrier and Joseph Fouch√© had been involved in overthrowing Robespierre, largely because they feared him calling them to account.David Andress, The Terror: The Merciless War for Freedom in Revolutionary France, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, (2005), p. 237. It took a period of several months before all of the leading figures associated with the Reign of Terror were brought to trial or removed from power. Economically, there were food shortages as a result of a hard winter in 1794‚Äì5 and the assignat currency collapsed. The harvest of 1794 was poor, particularly in the areas which supplied Paris and in many northern areas people were reduced to consuming seed during the winter. Further south, rivers remained iced over and roads remained impassable in the spring, hindering trade and raising local prices.The Thermidorian regime and the Directory 1794‚Äì1799, CUP (1972), p. 11. The assignat fell from 31% of its face value in August 1794 to 24% in November, 17% in February and 8% in April 1795.The Thermidorian regime and the Directory 1794‚Äì1799, CUP (1972), p. 10. In Paris, hunger and desperation led to the Germinal uprising of April 1795. Militarily, the National Convention was fighting the Chouannerie rebellion in western France until December 1794.John Paxton, Companion to the French Revolution, Facts on File Publications (1988), p. 50.

Effects in other towns The White Terror spread throughout the country, with some regions claiming not to have been disgraced by the Reign of Terror and others believing that there had to be significant retributions. Individuals accused as terrorists were then put on trial and executed. Overall, the severity of the reactions to the Reign of Terror were dependent on how each region was involved in the Revolution and on that region's specific history. Lists of those persecuted, as well as existing judicial and police records, indicate that a strong majority of accusations made did not arise from actions during the Reign of Terror at all but rather from personal or regional grudges.McPhee, P. (2012) The White Terror, in A Companion to the French Revolution, Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Oxford. doi: 10.1002/9781118316399.ch22 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118316399.ch22/summary *In the department of Pyrenees-Orientales, records state that after Thermidor there were no terrorists residing there. They boasted of not having been \\"disgraced\\" by either the Terror or the Reaction. *In the small village of Velleron the Vaucluse, with a population of about 900 people, quite a few of its citizens had been wrongfully convicted and executed in the Reign of Terror. Many of the people who brought these charges were their fellow citizens. Many of the accused were eventually persecuted or sent to the guillotine. After the Reign of Terror, from 1796 to 1797, the families that had been the victims of these arrests led a \\"reaction\\" against the accusers of the Reign of Terror. The most common methods of persecution against the accused during the White Terror were either arson or murder. Judicial records indicate about 9 convictions of individuals alongside their families *In Montbrison, a district of Loire, over 258 persons reported violence towards them and others during the Reign of Terror. However, in Loire, there were long phases of conflict and reciprocal vengeance due to religious intolerance. The long-standing religious conflict has made historians wonder if the White Terror was used as a means of maintaining a conflict with rival religious groups. In 1798 there was a prison massacre in Loire led by the anti-Jacobin leader General Am√©d√©e Willot. Willot is commonly referred to as the individual who incited the White Terror in the town of Loire. His occupation of the town is commonly referred to as la R√©action Willot. His fierce anti Jacobin policies convinced Willot to abuse the powers vested in him by the convention, establish a military dictatorship and openly persecute local patriots. Individuals accused of being Jacobins were imprisoned and eventually slaughtered. *In the 8,000 person community of Aubagne there was a large local impact from the Reign of Terror. Primarily from 1795 to 1797, there was a phase of prolonged violence. The town had a large number of revolutionaries, as well as a long history of factional conflict. From 1795 to 1797, the years that are considered the town's \\"Reaction\\" to the Reign of Terror, 413 people were imprisoned and eventually executed. Judicial records indicate that the accusations and deaths during the Reign of Terror and the White Terror both followed historical familial struggles and traditional regional struggle patterns.

Following the return of Louis XVIII to power, people suspected of having ties with the governments of the French Revolution or of Napoleon suffered arrest. Several hundred were killed by angry mobs, or executed after a quick trial at a drum head court- martial.Gwynn Lewis, \\"The White Terror of 1815 in the Department of the Gard: Counter-Revolution, Continuity and the Individual\\" Past & Present No. 58 (Feb., 1973), pp. 108-135 online Historian John B. Wolf argues that Ultra- royalists‚Äîmany of whom had just returned from exile‚Äîwere staging a counter- revolution against the French Revolution, and also against Napoleon's revolution. :Throughout the Midi ‚Äî in Provence, Avignon, Languedoc, and many other places ‚Äî the White Terror raged with unrelenting ferocity. The royalists found in the willingness of the French to desert the king fresh proof of their theory that the nation was honeycombed with traitors, and used every means to seek out and destroy their enemies. The government was powerless or unwilling to intervene. However, this forgets the fact that on his first return in 1814, Louis XVIII, was perfectly willing to let bygones be bygones. It was only after they sided with Napoleon (Which was treason)a second time that they were severely punished. The period is named after the First White Terror that occurred during the Thermidorians in 1795, when people identified as being associated with the Reign of Terror were harassed and killed. Bourbon reprisals The Execution of Marshal Ney, 1868 painting by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me After the Hundred Days, Napoleon's brief return to power in 1815, the second White Terror focused mainly on the purging of a civilian administration which had almost completely turned against the Bourbon monarchy. About 70,000 officials were dismissed from their positions. The remnants of the Napoleonic army was disbanded after the Battle of Waterloo and its senior officers cashiered. Marshal Ney was executed for treason, Marshal Brune was killed in Avignon, and General Jean-Pierre Ramel was assassinated in Toulouse. Approximately 6,000 individuals who had rallied to Napoleon were brought to trial. There were about 300 mob lynchings In the south of France,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, vol. 7, page 662 notably in Marseille where his Mamelukes were massacred in their barracks. Aftermath These actions struck fear in the population, persuading liberal and moderate electors (48,000 of the 72,000 voters eligible under the franchise in force) to vote for the ultra-royalists. Of 402 members, the first Chamber of the Restoration was composed of 350 ultra-royalists; the king himself thus named it the Chambre introuvable (\\"the Unobtainable Chamber\\"), called as such because the Chamber was \\"more royalist than the king\\" (plus royalistes que le roi), in Louis XVIII's words. The Chamber voted, sentencing Marshal Ney and the Comte de la B√©doy√®re to death for treason, while 250 people were given prison sentences and some others exiled, including Joseph Fouch√©, Lazare Carnot, and Cambac√©r√®s. The surviving \\"regicides\\" who had voted for the execution of Louis XVI in 1792 were exiled.

Following the war, President Thomas Jefferson signed legislation establishing the United States Military Academy (USMA) on the site in 1802. In 1817 the Academy was transformed by the appointment of Sylvanus Thayer who drastically reformed the curriculum. Revolutionary War and founding West Point, 1780The harsh winter of 1777‚Äì1778 froze the Hudson River, allowing elements of the Connecticut militia under the command of General Samuel Holden Parsons to march westward across the river. They first occupied West Point on 27 January 1778,Crackel (1991), p. 41. making it the longest continually occupied post in the United States.Palka (2008), p. viii. George Washington considered West Point to be the most important military position in America.,Ambrose, p. 10. stationing his headquarters there in the summer and fall of 1779.Neff, p. 127. After his victory over the British Army at the Battle of Yorktown, Washington kept the Continental Army garrisoned nearby at New Windsor at the New Windsor Cantonment until the official end of the war. The original owner of the land at West Point was a General Stephen Moore of North Carolina. The Continental Army occupied his land for twelve years until Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton authorized the purchase of the land for $11,085 in 1790. Remnants of the Great Chain Between 1778 and 1780, Polish engineer and military hero Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko oversaw the construction of the garrison's defenses.Crackel (1991), p. 44. Ko≈õciuszko's small garden retreat still stands today as Kosciuszko's Garden. The Great Chain and high ground above the narrow \\"S\\" curve in the Hudson River enabled the Continental Army to prevent British ships from sailing up river and dividing the Colonies.Crackel (2002), p. 13.Crackel (1991), pp. 37‚Äì45. Because of the unique bend in the river, ships of the day had to slow down to a near complete stop to navigate the turn. Though never tested, the chain performed its purpose by preventing British movement up river. Several forts and redoubts were constructed to defend this turn in the river. The closest to the river was Fort Clinton, formerly named Fort Arnold for his victory at Saratoga in 1777.Neff, p. 126. The remains of this fort can be seen on the western edge of the Plain between Thayer Road and the Hudson River. A few hundred feet higher in elevation was Fort Putnam, near the site of the present day Michie Stadium. A series of smaller redoubts protected these two forts. Several are still visible, including Redoubt Four, at the highest point on the academy, and Redoubt Seven, across the river on Constitution Island. It was as commander of the fortifications at West Point that Benedict Arnold committed his infamous act of treason when he attempted to sell the fort to the British. Jonathan Williams The academy can trace its earliest roots to the 1776 Continental Congress authorization of the establishment of a \\"Corps of Invalids\\". This organization would \\"give service to disabled officers\\" with one its missions being to impart \\"military knowledge to 'young gentlemen'\\".Ambrose, pp. 8‚Äì9. This \\"Corps\\" moved to the garrison at West Point in 1781, but few officers reported for duty and it was disbanded after the end of the war in 1783. In the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, West Point was the largest post in the army, with more than half of the approximately 100 authorized men in the entire army stationed there.Ambrose, pp. 9‚Äì10. Thomas Jefferson During his presidency, George Washington realized a need for a national military academy to teach the art and science of war, but his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson argued that there was no provision in the Constitution that allowed for the creation of a military academy. Many in the Congress also feared establishing a Military Academy as too aristocratic.West Point in the Making of America: The United States Military Academy at West Point Smithsonian National Museum of American History In 1794, Congress authorized the establishment of a \\"Corps of Artillerist and Engineers\\" at West Point, though an official course of study was not firmly established until well after the formal founding of the Academy in 1802.Ambrose, pp. 11‚Äì15. Despite Washington's support for the founding of an academy, his presidency, and that of his successor, failed to produce a formal academy. American military failures in frontier-fighting such as the Battle of the Wabash and the Quasi-War with France motivated Congress to authorize president John Adams to improve the instruction at West Point, but little resulted due to a lack of qualified instructors. By the time Adams left office in 1801, the Corps consisted of only twelve cadets and one instructorAmbrose, pp. 13‚Äì15. Despite his earlier misgivings, when Jefferson became president, he called for and signed legislation establishing a \\"Corps of Engineers\\" which \\"shall be stationed at West Point and constitute a Military Academy\\" on 16 March 1802.Ambrose, p. 22. Jefferson wanted a \\"national university\\" that focused on science and engineering and was looking for an American with a strong scientific background to command the academy. In 1801, he found his man in Jonathan Williams. Though he had no previous military experience, Williams was a well-known scientist of his day, and a relative of Benjamin Franklin. Williams accepted Jefferson's appointment to the rank of Colonel and arrived to assume his post on 14 Dec 1801. Early years Academy in 1828. All structures depicted are now gone.Miller, p.5. The first graduates of the academy were Joseph Gardner Swift and Simeon Magruder Levy, who graduated on 12 October 1802. Swift would later return as Superintendent from 1812‚Äì1814.West Point Bicentennial: The Early Years USMA Bicentennial Alden Partridge, an 1806 graduate, served as Professor of Mathematics and Engineering, and was Acting Superintendent on occasions from 1808 to 1813.Henry Barnard, Science And Art Of War, 1872, pages 833 to 836 Partridge served as Superintendent from 1814 to 1817, and was responsible for selecting the gray uniforms students still wear today.James S. Robbins, Last in Their Class: Custer, Pickett and the Goats of West Point, 2006, page 3 The early years of the academy were a tumultuous time, with few standards for admission or length of study. Cadets ranged in age from 10 to 37 and attended between 6 months to 6 years. The impending War of 1812 caused Congress to authorize a more formal system of education at the academy, and increased the size of the Corps of Cadets to 250. By the War of 1812, only 89 officers had graduated, morale was low, and the Academy was in danger of being disbanded. 1811 graduate George Ronan, assigned to duty at Fort Dearborn on the American frontier, was killed in the War of 1812 and became the first member of the Corps of Cadets to die in combat. Alden Partridge was accused of lax management and resigned his commission in 1818, unhappy at turning the Superintendent's position over to Sylvanus Thayer, who had been one of Partridge's students.George Washington Cullum, Biographical register of the officers and graduates of the U.S Military Academy, Volume 3, 1891, pages 642 to 643 Partridge went on to found Norwich University.William Arba Ellis, Norwich University: Her History, Her Graduates, Her Roll of Honor, 1898, page 2 Thayer and his changes Thayer StatueIn 1817, Colonel Sylvanus Thayer became the superintendent. He is known as the \\"Father of the Military Academy.\\" He upgraded academic standards, instilled military discipline, and emphasized honorable conduct.West Point in the Making of America: Sylvanus Thayer Smithsonian National Museum of American History He also created a teaching method known today as the Thayer Method, which emphasizes self study and daily homework, as well as small class size. This method of instruction is still used today. Thayer made civil engineering the foundation of the curriculum. For the first half century, USMA graduates were largely responsible for the construction of the bulk of the nation's initial railway lines, bridges, harbors and roads.West Point in the Making of American History: A School for the Nation Smithsonian National Museum of American History This tradition continues in the hands of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Thayer was responsible for forging many of the traditions and culture that are the essence of the Academy even in modern times. During his tenure, the Corps of Cadets thrived and due to the small size of the Regular Army during this period of American history, USMA became the predominant source of commissioned officers. This led to an increase in the esprit-de- corps and honoring of tradition that is so ingrained in West Point culture. The tradition of the class ring began during Thayer's tenure, in 1835 ‚Äì the first such university in the US to do so. After Thayer until the war with Mexico After the tenure of Thayer, the Academy faced challenges to its relevance as many new Western State congressmen saw it as a breeding ground for an elitist aristocratic Officer Corps. The War with Mexico, 1846‚Äì1848, changed the nation's perception of the Academy. Because of the Army's slow promotion system of the time, no graduate of the academy had made general officer rank at the start of the war. However, many junior and mid-level officer graduates proved themselves invaluable in battle. Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee first distinguished themselves in battle in Mexico. In all 452 of 523 West Point graduates who served in the war received battlefield promotions or awards for bravery. Mexican War until the Civil War The Corps of Cadets, circa 1870s Dean's House and Professor Row in background, circa 1870 Robert E. Lee (class of 1829) was the Superintendent from 1852‚Äì1857. In 1857, West Point began the current process of admitting candidates nominated by the members of the United States Congress, one for each congressional district. The 1850s saw a modernization of many sorts at West Point, and this era was often romanticized by the graduates who led both sides of the Civil War as the \\"end of the Old West Point era\\". New barracks brought better heat and gas lighting, while new ordnance and tactics training incorporated new rifle and musket technology and advancement such as the steam engine. With the outbreak of the Civil War, West Point graduates filled the general officer ranks of the rapidly expanding Confederate and Union armies. Two hundred ninety four graduates served as general officers for the Union, and 151 served as general officers for the Confederacy. An astounding 10% of all graduates (105) were killed in action during the war, and another 15% (151) were wounded in action. Nearly every general officer of note from either side during the Civil War was a graduate of West Point. Post‚ÄìCivil War until Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Henry O. Flipper The years immediately following the American Civil War were a difficult time for the Academy as it struggled to admit and reintegrate cadets from former Confederate states. The first cadets from Southern states were re-admitted in 1868, and 1870 saw the admission of the first African-American cadet, James Webster Smith of South Carolina. Smith did not graduate, so Henry O. Flipper of Georgia become the first African- American graduate in 1877, graduating 50th of a class of 77. In the 35 years between the Civil War and 1900, the Academy admitted 12 African American cadets with three graduating. Despite the low graduation rate, the admittance of African-American cadets at all to West Point was unusual and progressive for the country as a whole during this time. The post Civil War Era also saw a shift in the Academy's curriculum from being very focused upon engineering to a more broad education. The control of the Academy was changed from the Corps of Engineers to the Secretary of War, and for the first time, Superintendents were not from the Engineer Branch. As the \\"Gilded Age\\" saw a blossoming of liberal arts education in the private sector, West Point struggled to adapt and change its engineering-heavy curriculum to match the times. 1875, Willard Young, son of Mormon leader and pioneer, Brigham Young, became the first Latter-day Saint to graduate. Other more notable graduates during this period were George Washington Goethals from the Class of 1880 and John J. Pershing from the Class of 1886. Goethals would gain notoriety as the chief engineer of the Panama Canal and Pershing would become famous for chasing the famed Pancho Villa on the Mexican border and for leading American Forces during World War I. The outbreaks of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War saw the classes of 1899 and 1901 graduate early, the first such classes to do so. 1900 to World War I Hayes Gym built in 1910, still in use 2008The wars in Cuba at the turn of the 20th century spurred Congress to authorize an increase in the size of the Corps of Cadets to 481 in 1900. The period between 1900 and 1915 saw a construction boom as much of West Points old infrastructure was torn down and rebuilt. A new administration building, barracks, academic building, riding hall, gymnasium, and a cadet chapel were all completed by 1914. In 1916, Congress increased the size of the Corps of Cadets to 1,332. Many of the most famous graduates in the 20th century graduated during the 15-year period between 1900 and 1915: Douglas MacArthur (1903), Joseph Stilwell (1904), Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold (1907), George S. Patton (1909), Dwight D. Eisenhower & Omar Bradley (both 1915) all graduated during this time. The Class of 1915 is known as the \\"Class the Stars Fell Upon\\" for the exceptionally high % of general officers (59 of the 164) that rose from that class. This period also saw the infancy of intercollegiate athletics at the Academy. The Army-Navy football rivalry was born the decade before in 1890 with a victory by Navy at West Point, followed with Army's avenging that loss in Annapolis the following year. The Academy's other major sports teams began play during this period. The outbreak of America's involvement in World War I caused a sharp increase in the demand for army officers, and the academy accelerated graduation of all four classes then in attendance to meet this requirement, beginning with the early graduation of the First Class on 20 April 1917, followed by the Second Class in August 1917, and graduation of both the Third and Fourth Classes just before the Armistice of 11 November 1918, when only freshman cadets remained (those who had entered in the summer of 1918). In all, wartime contingencies and post-war adjustments resulted in ten classes, varying in length of study from two to four years, within a seven-year period before the regular course of study was fully resumed. See class introductions for each class from 1917 to 1923. Between the world wars Douglas MacArthur as superintendent The Interwar years saw the Academy push to modernize to meet the demands of the emerging technologies in warfare. One of the Academy's most distinguished graduates and a decorated WWI combat soldier and leader, Douglas MacArthur, became Superintendent in 1919. He instituted sweeping reforms to the academic process, introducing a greater emphasis on history and humanities. He began the process of having instructors study at civilian institutions prior to serving at West Point and he provided more liberal leave and pass opportunities to the upper classes. He made major changes to the field training regimen and the Cadet Honor Committee was formed under his watch in 1922. MacArthur was a firm supporter of athletics at the Academy, as he famously said \\"Upon the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that, upon other fields, on other days, will bear the fruits of victory.‚Äù West Point became an officially accredited institution with the Association of American Universities in 1925 and in 1933 officially began granting the title of Bachelor of Science to all graduates. It was also just prior to World War II that the Academy expanded the reservation boundaries, growing to the nearly that it comprises today. In 1935, the United States Congress increased the Corps of Cadets to 1,960. As more cadets filled the barracks and classrooms, another building program was undertaken and completed by 1938. World War II to coeducation Maxwell Taylor as superintendentCongress expanded the Corps of Cadets to 2,496 in 1942, and the academy reverted to a three-year course of study. The Class of 1943 was redesignated the Class of January 1943 and graduated six months early. Subsequent classes, from June 1943 through 1947, graduated in three years. The war years brought a greater emphasis on military training. In 1943, summer training was formally moved from the Plain to the new area recently acquired southwest of main post, which would later become Camp Buckner. Flight training was conducted at Stewart Field in Newburgh, and the academy graduated more than 1,000 commissioned pilots between 1943 and 1946. Nearly 500 graduates gave their lives in World War II. In 1945, Maxwell Taylor (class of 1922) became superintendent, ushering in the beginnings of the modern Military Academy. Taylor expanded the size of departments, added several new professors, abolished antiquated courses in fencing and horsemanship, inserted the study of amphibious operations into the military curriculum, and added courses in nuclear physics, electronics and communications.West Point in the Making of America: Making the Modern Academy. Smithsonian National Museum of American History. In response to Eisenhower's belief that American leaders needed to understand the psychology of the citizen soldier, courses were added in leadership and applied psychology. These changes provided graduates with a better understanding of how to motivate and lead the soldiers of a free society. Coursework in the humanities and social sciences increased to 40 percent of a cadet's total workload. When the Korean War began, the academy continued on a steady course and did not face major disruption from the conflict. The Korean War and an honor scandal in 1951 led to a decline in admissions, so that by 1954, only 67% of the Academy's authorized strength was filled. The Academy responded with its first modern advertising campaign.\\" In 1955, the Hollywood motion picture The Long Gray Line, based upon another book by Colonel Reeder and his sister, was completed, and the CBS dramatic series The West Point Story aired on television. Colonel Russell \\"Red\\" Reeder, Class of 1926, wrote several popular novels about fictional West Point cadets which first appeared in 1955. A massive review of the curriculum led to the introduction of electives, growing from zero electives that a cadet could have in his career in the late 1950s, to a maximum of eight by 1972. The increasing sophistication of the curriculum also affected the organization of the academic departments with, for example, the creation of two new departments in 1969 -the Department of History and the Department of Engineering. In the 1960s, the size of the Corps expanded from 2,200 to 4,400. Following the creation of the U.S. Air Force as a separate service in 1947 and until the graduation of the first United States Air Force Academy class in 1959, West Point cadets who met the eligibility standards could apply to be commissioned as Air Force officers. Coeducation to present day West Point first accepted women as cadets in 1976, when Congress authorized the admission of women to all of the federal service academies. Women comprise about 15 percent of entering plebes (freshmen); and they pursue the same academic and professional training as do their male classmates, except with different physical aptitude standards on the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) and the Indoor Obstacle Course Test (IOCT). In addition, women take boxing during plebe year physical education, just as the men do. The first class with female cadets graduated in 1980. In 1989, Kristen Baker became the first female first captain at West Point. To date [May 2018] five females have been appointed as the first captain: Kristen Baker in 1989, Grace H. Chung in 2004, Stephanie Hightower in 2006, Lindsey Danilak in 2014, and Simone Askew in 2018. In 1995, Rebecca Marier became the academy's first female valedictorian. The first female West Point alumna to attain flag (general officer) rank was Rebecca Halstead, class of 1981. She was promoted to brigadier general in 2005 and served as the Army's Chief of Ordnance before retiring in 2008. Vincent Brooks became the first African-American first captain in 1980. In 1985, cadets' number of authorized electives rose from 8 to 10 and they were allowed to declare a major, as all previous graduates had been awarded a Bachelor of Science with no major concentration. Because of the still-heavy emphasis upon math and science in all cadets' core course load, all cadets are still granted a Bachelor of Science upon graduation, even those who major in a liberal arts field of study. 1990 saw a major revision of the \\"Fourth Class System\\", as the Cadet Leader Development System (CLDS) became the guidance for the development of all four classes. Despite its reputation for resisting change, West Point was an early adopter of the use of the Internet, authorizing full access to all cadets free of charge in their barracks room in 1996. Today, the academy has received numerous awards for its high level of use of the Internet to conduct daily activities. From 1990 to 1994 West Point granted a total of 59 master's degrees as part of the Eisenhower Scholar Program for new tactical officers. This is the only time in history a U.S. service academy has granted graduate level diplomas. This program still exists, but has since been restructured so that the degrees are granted on behalf of Columbia University, and not West Point. Academy coat of arms 120px Designed in 1898 by Professors Larned, Bass, and Tillman,Hulse, p.22. the original design was nearly identical to the current, but was oriented to the right. In 1923, the coat of arms was oriented to the left to conform to more traditional conventions of heraldry. Some of the older buildings on post still bear the original, right-oriented version. The shield is topped by the American bald eagle and the academy's motto of \\"Duty, Honor, Country\\" and \\"West Point MDCCCII USMA\\" which is the date of USMA's founding.

It is an important element of theories of dielectric materials. The polarization of a dielectric material is a competition between torques due to the imposed electric field, which tend to align the molecules, and collisions, which tend to destroy the alignment. The theory of rotational Brownian motion allows one to calculate the net result of these two competing effects, and to predict how the permittivity of a dielectric material depends on the strength and frequency of the imposed electric field. Rotational Brownian motion was first discussed by Peter Debye,Debye, P., Berichte der deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft, 15, 777 (1913) who applied Albert Einstein's theory of translational Brownian motion to the rotation of molecules having permanent electric dipoles. Debye ignored inertial effects and assumed that the molecules were spherical, with an intrinsic, fixed dipole moment. He derived expressions for the dielectric relaxation time and for the permittivity. These formulae have been successfully applied to many materials. However, Debye's expression for the permittivity predicts that the absorption tends toward a constant value when the frequency of the applied electric field becomes very large‚Äîthe \\"Debye plateau\\". This is not observed; instead, the absorption tends toward a maximum and then declines with increasing frequency. The breakdown in Debye's theory in these regimes can be corrected by including inertial effects; allowing the molecules to be non-spherical; including dipole-dipole interactions between molecules; etc. These are computationally very difficult problems and rotational Brownian motion is a topic of much current research interest.

Nuclear medicine procedures are the major clinical applications of molecular imaging and molecular therapy.Wagner Henry N. (2006), A Personal History of Nuclear Medicine. Springer. National Atomic MuseumPotchen EJ: Reflections on the early years of nuclear medicine. Radiology 2000; 214:623-624. In the United States, nuclear medicine physicians are certified by the American Board of Nuclear Medicine and the American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine. History In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity.Blaufox MD: Becquerel and the discovery of radioactivity: Early concepts. Semin Nucl Med 1996; 26:145-154. It was only a little over a quarter of a century (1925) until the first radioactive tracer study in animals was performed by George de Hevesy, and the next year (1926) the first diagnostic tracer study in humans was performed by Herman Blumgart and Otto Yens.Patton DD: The birth of nuclear medicine instrumentation: Blumgart and Yens, 1925. J Nucl Med 2003; 44:1362. Some of the earliest applications of radioisotopes were therapy of hematologic malignancies and therapy of both benign and malignant thyroid disease. In the 1950s radioimmunoassay was developed by Solomon Berson and Rosalyn Yalow. Dr. Yalow was co-winner of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Dr. Berson had already died so was not eligible). Radioimmunoassay was used extensively in clinical medicine but more recently has been largely replaced by non-radioactive methods. In 1950, human imaging of both gamma and positron emitting radioisotopes was performed. Benedict Cassen's work with a directional probe lead to the development of the first imaging with a rectilinear scanner.Blahd WH: Ben Cassen and the development of the rectilinear scanner. Semin Nucl Med 1996; 26:165-170. . Gordon Brownell developed the first positron scanner.A History of positron imaging In the same decade (1954) the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) was organized in Spokane, Washington (USA),Harris CC: The formation and evolution of the society of nuclear medicine. Semin Nucl Med 1996;26:180-190. and (1958) Hal Anger developed the gamma scintillation camera,Gottschalk A: The early years with Hal Anger. Semin Nucl Med 1996; 26:171-179. which could image a whole region at the same time. Initial introduction of radioisotopes into medicine required individuals to acquire of a considerable background information which was foreign to their medical training. Often a particular application drove the introduction of radioisotopes into a health care facility. As other applications developed the physician or group that had developed knowledge of and experience with radioisotopes usually provided the new service. Consequently, the radioisotope service found homes in several established specialties ‚Äì commonly in radiology due to an interest in imaging, in pathology (clinical pathology) due to an interest in radioimmunoassay, and in endocrinology due to the early application of 131I to thyroid disease.Becker DV, Sawin CT: Radioiodine and thyroid disease: The beginning. Semin Nucl Med 1996; 26:155-164. Nuclear medicine became widespread and there was a need to develop a new specialty. In the United States, the American Board of Nuclear Medicine was formed in 1972.Ross JF: A history of the American Board of Nuclear Medicine. Semin Nucl Med. 1996 Jul;26(3):191-193. . At that time, the specialty include all of the uses of radioisotopes in medicine ‚Äì radioimmunoassay, diagnostic imaging, and therapy. As use of and experience with radioisotopes became more widespread in medicine, radioimmunoassay generally transferred from nuclear medicine to clinical pathology. Today, nuclear medicine is based on the use of the tracer principle applied to diagnostic imaging and therapy. PracticeProcedures= * Examples of the most common clinical nuclear medicine procedures are ** glucose metabolic imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for cancer, ** myocardial perfusion imaging for coronary artery disease, and ** skeletal imaging for both benign and malignant bone disease. * Examples of common procedures are ** brain perfusion and glucose metabolic imaging for seizure and dementia, ** blood pool imaging for myocardial function and gastrointestinal bleeding, ** gastric emptying studies for gastroparesis, ** hepatobiliary imaging for acute cholecystitis and gallbladder dysfunction, ** lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel lymph node biopsy, ** parathyroid imaging for hyperparathyroidism, ** pulmonary perfusion and ventilation imaging for pulmonary embolism, ** renal function imaging for various renal disorders, ** thyroid imaging for hyperthyroidism, ** thyroid whole body imaging for thyroid cancer, ** urinary tract imaging for vesicoureteral reflux, and ** white blood cell studies for infection. * Examples of uncommon but valuable procedures are ** octreotide (pentetreotide) or NETSPOT (gallium 68) imaging for somatostatin receptors found on the surface of many tumors, ** meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging for neuroendocrine tumors, ** heat-damaged red blood cell imaging for identifying ectopic splenic tissue, and ** gastric mucosa imaging for Meckel's diverticulum (especially in pediatrics). * Examples of radionuclide therapeutic procedures are ** 131I treatment of hyperthyroidism, ** 131I treatment of thyroid cancer, and ** radioimmunotherapy with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) & 131I tositumomab (Bexxar) therapy of low-grade non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. =Instrumentation= * Planar imaging :Most radionuclides give off gamma-rays when they decay. A 2-dimensional image of the radionuclide distribution can be made with a gamma camera, often called an Anger scintillation camera after its inventor, Hal Anger. * Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) :Multiple planar images taken from different angles around a patient can be reconstructed to form a stack of cross- sectional, tomographic images. * Positron emission tomography (PET)PET center of excellence :Some isotopes emit positrons (the anti-matter equivalent of an electron) when they decay. The positrons travel a short distance in tissue and then annihilate with an electron giving off two nearly back-to-back gamma rays. Positron emission tomography takes advantage of these back-to-back gamma rays to localize the distribution of the radioisotopes. * Combined molecular and anatomic imaging: SPECT/CT, PET/CT, and PET/MRI :The advantage of nuclear medicine is that it provides molecular and physiologic information, but it is relatively poor at providing anatomic information and the resolution is relatively poor. In recent years, instruments have been developed which allow both radioisotope and anatomic imaging. Most widespread are PET/CT scanners combining PET and computed tomography. Increasingly common are SPECT/CT scanners. Instruments combining PET with magnetic resonance, PET/MRI, are starting to be used. * Non-imaging instrumentation :Non-imaging instruments are used for measuring radioisotope doses, for counting samples, for measuring thyroid uptake of radioiodine, for measuring sentinel lymph node uptake during mastectomy procedures to and for radiation safety.  Training  In the United States, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS) accredit nuclear medicine residency programs, and the American Board of Nuclear Medicine (ABNM) and the American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine (AOBNM) certify nuclear medicine physicians. After completing medical school, a post-graduate clinical year is followed by three years of nuclear medicine residency. A common alternate path for physicians who have completed a radiology residency is a one-year residency in nuclear medicine, leading to sub-specialty certification by the American Board of Radiology. A less common path for physicians who have completed another residency is a two-year residency in nuclear medicine.ABNM brochure  Other professionals  Nuclear medicine procedures are performed by Nuclear Medicine Radiographers,nuclear medicine technologists who require extensive training both in underlying principles (physics, instrumentation) but also in the clinical applications. Nursing support, especially in the hospital setting, is valuable, but may be shared with other services. Nuclear medicine is a technology embedded specialty depending upon a large number of non-physician professional, including medical physicists, health physicists, radiobiologists, radiochemists, and radiopharmacists. Residency trained nuclear medicine physicians have the most extensive training and highest level of certification, including all aspects of diagnosis and radionuclide therapy. However, current U.S. regulations do not prohibit other physicians from interpreting nuclear medicine studies and perform radionuclide therapy. Radiologists who are not sub-specialty trained in the specialty, nonetheless often limit their practice to practicing nuclear medicine. Some cardiologists, especially non-invasive cardiologists, will interpret diagnostic cardiology studies including nuclear medicine studies. Radiation oncologists perform all forms of radiation therapy, sometimes including radionuclide therapy. Some endocrinologists treat hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer with 131I. The mix of physicians rendering nuclear medicine services varies both between different countries and within a single country.

The Constitutional Club was a London gentlemen's club, now dissolved, which was established in 1883 and disbanded in 1979. Between 1886 and 1959 it had a distinctive red and yellow Victorian terracotta building, designed by Robert William Edis, at 28 Northumberland Avenue, off Trafalgar Square. The Club was closely aligned to the Conservative party, with members having to pledge support. The club was founded in anticipation of imminent franchise reform then being debated in parliament, which was eventually realised as the Representation of the People Act 1884. It was anticipated that as many more Conservative supporters would be given the vote, many would want to belong to a Conservative club. Existing Conservative clubs like the Carlton and the Junior Carlton feared that they would become inundated with membership applications from the new voters, so the Constitutional Club was founded with these new electors in mind. (The National Liberal Club, just around the corner from the Constitutional Club, was founded in 1882 with the same purpose in mind for the Liberal party, as the existing Liberal clubs, the Reform and the Devonshire, had been similarly oversubscribed.) The Constitutional Club's membership was originally limited to 6,500. Despite being avowedly non-political, P.G. Wodehouse was a member of the Constitutional Club, and was reputed to have considered it his favourite London club. Seven of his stories describe a fictitious Senior Conservative Club in Northumberland Avenue, with a similar d√©cor to the Constitutional, and which also features a Turkish bath, just like the Turkish bath found next door to the Constitutional. These books are Psmith in the City, Something Fresh, Leave it to Psmith (where the club is said to have 6,111 members), Pig-hoo-o- o-o-ey, Full Moon, A Tithe for Charity, and Pearls, Girls and Monty Bodkin (which establishes its Northumberland Avenue address). The replacement building (left) in 2015 Like many other London clubs, the Constitutional experienced severe financial difficulties with the passing years. In 1959, they agreed to the demolition of the club's well-known, purpose-built terracotta premises, and its replacement with a new office-style building, which was completed in 1962 - this is the building which still stands on that site today, on the corner of Northumberland Avenue and Northumberland Street, opposite the Sherlock Holmes pub. Between 1962 and 1964 the club occupied rooms in first the Junior Carlton Club and then the United Service Club, before acquiring premises of its own on St. James's Street. By the mid-1970s its membership had dwindled to only 1,000, and its financial predicament was serious enough that it had to close in 1979, with its remaining members merging with the St Stephen's Club.

The vertical axis rotation is intended to eliminate the static and dynamic problems that limit the size of conventional wind turbines. The prototype STEM yo-yo is under construction at Berzano di San Pietro in Italy.  History  The KiteGen was originally conceived by Italian researcher Massimo Ippolito. While observing kite surfers, he noticed the large amount of energy that the kite could collect and thought that a similar system could produce electricity. This idea seemed to Ippolito so risky that he put it aside for years.  Structure  The problem of capturing the wind is solved by the use of Power Wing Profiles (Power kites) whose movements are controlled automatically by a computer. The kites are tied by cables to a structure that rotates, generating electricity. This structure is the turbine, while the kites are the \\"blades\\". The kites are flown on a predetermined trajectory, that can transform the exerted force on the cable, to an overall mechanical torque which rotates the vertical axis turbine. About 20 automatically controlled kites can keep rotating a turbine of 1,600 meters diameter at a speed of 15 revolutions per hour. This can generate 1 Gigawatt of power, equivalent to a medium size nuclear power station but with an estimated capital cost 10 times lower. In other words, 1 cubic Km of sky is able to provide 1 GigaWatt of power for 80% of the time in a year. The long cables allows them to reach heights over 500 meters, where wind is strong, without introducing structural weaknesses.  High-altitude wind  There are two wind flow bands that envelope Earth. One is in the southern hemisphere at the latitude of Patagonia, while the other is in the northern hemisphere over Europe. The flow height ranges from 800 meters up to 10,000 meters, while the width is 4,000 or 5,000 km. The average power of the wind is about 2 kW per square meter. High-altitude wind is much more powerful and constant than that at earth level, which is intense in very few places, and at full speed for only about 1,700-1,800 hours per year, which limits the annual production of energy. KiteGen plans to use wind at around 800 meters altitude with average speeds of 7 m/s and specific power of 200 W/m^2. For example, a section of wind width of 1,000 meters at an altitude between 600 and 1,000 meters has a power of 400*1000*200 = 80 MW. The conceptual prototype in the Province of Asti which would work with nine generators and up to 10,000 m altitude would generate a peak power of 27 MW. A park of Kitegens with 100 MW peak power should produce 500 GWh/year; enough for 86,000 households The Kitegen can operate about 6000 hours per year.  Funding  In June 2006, KiteGen had been selected to receive public funding from the Italian Ministry for Economic Development. Although the project received a \\"priority B\\" score, the procedure evaluation was not done because of lack of funds. Funding, performance evaluation and capital adequacy is proceeding from the evaluator agency (Sanpaolo-Intesa Bank). Under the 7th Framework Program of the European Union, an elaboration of the project within the transport sector was rated \\"excellent\\" and received ‚Ç¨3 million funding to create a system for generating electricity aboard ships, traction and management of ancillary services (proposal No. 218,691; acronym: \\"KitVes\\"). In November 2008, the European Union informed that provision of funds will start \\"soon\\".  Mobilegen  In August 2006, a prototype named Mobilegen was tested. This truck mounted system is mobile and uses low-altitude wind. A mobile generator of second generation was tested in September 2007 at Francesco Cappa airport located in Casale Monferrato (Province of Alessandria, Italy). The unit called KSU1 used a kite that flew to 800 meters with automatic controls. The experiments lasted three days and required special permits from civil and military aviation.  Aluminium smelter  In September 2012, Kitegen made an offer to the Government of Italy to power the aluminium smelter operated by ALCOA in Portovesme. The plant is the biggest energy user in Italy with 2.3 Twh/year. Kitegen planned a farm of 200 generators in 1 square kilometer near the plant to generate 300 MW of power with availability of 5000 hours per year. The costs of construction can be written off in nearly 2 years with energy costs around 30 ‚Ç¨/Mwh. For comparison, Glencore offer for the smelter want to relieve it only if the energy is cheaper than 37 ‚Ç¨/Mwh by state aids because high power costs of nearby Sulcis Coal Power Station (around 70 ‚Ç¨/Mwh) are the main reason for ALCOA to leave Sardinia.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History The history of the prison stretches back to 1890, when it opened as a city gaol. Rebuilt in 1912, it became a closed training establishment for adult males, a role it continued until 1997. Since then, it has received prisoners from the courts of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire as a category B local prison. In 1999, the Home Office announced that Nottingham Prison was to serve as a pilot project of a potentially national plan to track paedophiles and other high risk offenders after their release from their sentence by providing them housing in flats on prison sites. A dozen local residents staged protests in opposition. In October 2004, a voluntary drug testing scheme established at Nottingham Prison was \\"hailed as a success\\". Participants in the scheme underwent intensive drug therapy, with prisoners who remained drug-free offered the opportunity of early release from their sentences. In July 2004, the Independent Monitoring Board published a report which called for the worn-out Victorian wing of Nottingham Prison to be closed and urgently refurbished, as it \\"was becoming totally unsuitable for accommodating anybody ‚Äì especially in winter when ... [temperatures in the building could] be as cold as 10¬∞C\\". Soon after this the prison wing was closed down. In June 2008, it was announced that Nottingham would undergo major re-construction that would double the size of the prison. The ¬£95 million facelift saw the condemned Victorian wing demolished and new accommodation and facilities built in its place. The prison today Nottingham is a Category B local prison, holding convicted and remand adult males from the local courts in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The prison provides education, workshop places and domestic duties to occupy inmates. Community projects at the prison include regular visits by local children with special needs. Resettlement services at Nottingham offer advice on housing and debt management, as well as assistance with employment. There is also a Listeners Scheme for those prisoners who are considered to be at risk from suicide or self-harm. There is concern over large numbers of deaths among inmates. Notably 5 prisoners died over one month in autumn 2017, 4 believed to be by suicide. Deborah Coles of Inquest said, ‚ÄúThe fact these deaths occurred within days of arrival at the prison when prisoners are known to be most vulnerable, raise concerns about the processes for identifying and managing risk.‚Äù In January 2018 Peter Clarke, the Chief Inspector of Prisons wrote an urgent notification letter to Justice Secretary David Gauke, advising that three consecutive inspections had found the prison to be \\"fundamentally unsafe\\" and warning that there would be \\"further tragedies\\" unless safety measures were put in place. Clarke maintained three times in succession inspectors had found the prison, \\"fundamentally unsafe\\". Clarke also wrote, \\"Inspection findings at HMP Nottingham tell a story of dramatic decline since 2010.\\" Clarke claimed, \\"irrefutable evidence\\" exists that there had been no response to findings from previous inspection and it was \\"extraordinary\\" there had failed to be a more \\"robust\\" response. Clarke claimed there were sufficient prison officers at Nottingham Prison but over half had less than a year's experience. He stated, \\"It appears that the problems at Nottingham are intractable and that staff there are unable to improve safety despite the fact that this failing increases the vulnerability both of those who are held in the prison and of those who work there.\\" There was yet another death in October 2018, the chief inspector of prisons described the prison as \\"dangerous\\" and \\"disrespectful\\". There have been 8 suicides at Nottingham Prison since 2016. Peter Clarke suspects suicides might have happened because prisoners could not face life at the \\"drug-ridden jail\\" any longer.Another prisoner dies at 'dangerous' HMP Nottingham BBC Notable inmates *Ian Paterson ‚Äì surgeon jailed for 15 years, later increased to 20 years by the Court of Appeal, in 2017 for wounding his patients with intent by performing unnecessary surgical procedures.

Ancient cyanobacteria were ancestral to the chloroplasts of all plants on earth. Gloeocapsa magma may resemble \\"algae\\" in that they are green, but in fact cyanobacteria are bacteria whereas algae are single-celled eukaryotes (cells with nuclei) that are closely related to plants. Impact on human habitation Gloeocapsa magma gained notoriety in the Southeastern United States in the 1990s, but it has since spread throughout most of the rest of the United States and Canada. This particular type of cyanobacteria is responsible for creating black stains and streaks on roofs. The bacteria accumulate over time as it feeds on moisture and calcium carbonate.Schoff, J. (2008). Green Up Your Cleanup. Creative Homeowner This accumulation begins to show the black stains as the cyanobacteria develop their dark and hard UV-protective outer coating. The main reasons for the rapid spread and noticeability of these cyanobacteria are thought to be: # Rising humidity and temperatures combined with more and more bacteria spores promotes their spread with these favorable conditions. # Fiberglass shingles are made with limestone as a filler (in the asphalt). These shingles hold moisture and organic \\"bacteria food\\" material longer (especially on the North- side in the Midwest of the USA) than the paper/asphalt/ceramic shingles of the 1980s. The bacteria are airborne. This cyanobacteria causes substantial destruction to roofs causing shingle decay and loss of reflective power. Over time, Gloeocapsa magma breaks down the shingles by feeding off of the limestone granules embedded in the shingles. This decreases a roof's ability to reflect ultra-violet rays of light and shortens the life of the roof. Once the bacteria have become noticeable, the stains will continue to worsen year to year. As the bacterial colony grows, gravity pulls it downward, resulting in the smear-like stain down roofs. Most experts within the subject area conclude the bacteria to be harmful, if left untreated, as the growth holds moisture within shingles causing premature aging, rotting, and/or granule loss. The buildup of Gloeocaspa magma on residential properties has led to earlier roof replacements, lowered property resale values, insurance companies canceling policies and increased utility costs as the black stained roofing draws in more heat. Treatment There are many available options for the eradication of Gloeocapsa Magma, the most common and most widely accepted solution being an application of Sodium Hypochlorite as well as Copper Sulfate. The preferred technique is a non-pressure application of a properly proportioned detergent mix, as this will avoid costly damage to the shingles. Many roof cleaning contractors offer this method of cleaning.

Generally, Rory writes the melodies, and Calum the lyrics. Early life His brother Rory was born in Dornoch, Sutherland. His father, Donald John MacDonald of Scalpay, was a World War II veteran. The family moved to North Uist, when Rory was about four years old. Calum MacDonald himself was born in Lochmaddy, North Uist. When the time came for Rory to attend High School, which at the time was situated in Portree, on the Isle of Skye, the whole family moved en masse. It was in Skye that the brothers formed Runrig along with Blair Douglas and subsequently Donnie Munro. MacDonald attended Jordanhill College and worked as a P.E. teacher until Runrig went 'professional'. Later life During the 1980s, MacDonald's Christian faith deepened and this influence began to be felt in his lyrical content, in both Gaelic and English. He was based in Edinburgh for the 1980s and early 1990s before re-locating his young family to Contin in the Highlands.

For the last four years of its existence, it had a clubhouse at 66-68 Pall Mall. The club was formed shortly after the mass defection of scores of Liberal MPs and Peers over the First Home Rule Bill, to create the new Liberal Unionist party. The new party went into an immediate alliance with the Conservatives, but remained a separate body until 1912. Because of this, many Liberal Unionist politicians found they were not wholly welcome in established Conservative clubs like the Carlton, but were equally shunned in traditionally Liberal clubs like the Reform. Consequently, the club was set up for Liberal Unionists, and moved to its Pall Mall clubhouse in 1888. The Clubhouse had originally been built for the short-lived Junior Naval and Military Club in 1875, which accumulated so much debt over the building that it went bankrupt in 1879. The premises were then taken over by a Conservative club, the Beaconsfield between 1880 and 1887. The Unionist Club always suffered from limited membership, as a great many Liberal Unionists stayed on in their old Liberal clubs, seeing themselves as 'true' Liberals - this is illustrated by an incident in 1912 when Winston Churchill tried to belittle Sir Edward Carson's integrity by saying \\"The right hon. Gentleman forces me to remind him that he was a member of the National Liberal Club\\", only to be told by Carson \\"I was elected as a Unionist.\\" Heavily in debt, the Unionist Club closed its doors in 1892. The building was eventually taken over by the New Oxford and Cambridge Club, which operated there from 1894 to 1920.

Mit Illustrationen von Lene Schneider-Kainer und einem Nachwort von Sabine Dahmen\\". Life and art She started her art studies in Vienna, and continued in Munich, Paris and Amsterdam. During a stay in Paris she met her future husband, Ludwig Kainer, a doctor, painter, graphic designer, poster artist and stage designer from Munich, whom she married in 1910. From about 1911 the couple belonged to a circle of artists and intellectuals that included Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Franz Werfel, Herwarth Walden and his wife, Else Lasker-Sch√ºler. Between 1912 and 1926 she lived in Berlin at 78 Niebuhrstra√üe in Charlottenburg. In 1914/15 Schneider-Kainer produced a strong and expressive oil painting of the poet and playwright Else Lasker-Sch√ºler. Schneider-Kainer made her debut as an artist in 1917 with an exhibition of some 50 oil paintings and drawings at the Galerie Gurlitt, shocking the art world of Berlin. There was an uproar over 30 erotic images, illustrating Wieland's 1788 German translation of the \\"Dialogues of the Courtesans (Hetaerae)\\" by Lucian. The artistic highpoint of Schneider-Kainer's career was in the years from 1919 to 1922 with the production of lithographic erotic portfolios with titles such as \\"Ten female acts\\" and \\"Before the Mirror.\\" In the 1920s Schneider-Kainer became renowned as painter and illustrator, enjoying great acclaim in Berlin and selling her works abroad. In 1926, Schneider-Kainer left Berlin after her divorce and for two years accompanied the poet Bernhard Kellermann on an extended odyssey, often by donkey or caravan, visiting Russia, Persia, India, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Tibet, Hongkong and China. In her memoirs, she wrote: She painted, photographed and sketched her impressions, and these contributions appeared regularly in the Berliner Tageblatt. On her return via the Trans-Siberian Railway, she presented a selection of her works from Asia in Berlin, Magdeburg, Stuttgart, Kiel, London and Rome, and produced illustrations for the magazine, \\"Die Dame\\". She did not return to Germany after a 1932 trip to the Balearic Islands because of the power takeover by the National Socialists. After this she settled on Mallorca, and later on Ibiza, where she started an artists' colony. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she left for New York. Under a pseudonym she published washable fabric children's books. She had successful exhibitions in Mallorca, Barcelona, Copenhagen, New York City and Philadelphia. In 1954 she settled in Bolivia, where she assisted her son in establishing a textile factory producing Native American designs for export to the United States.Women who moved Berlin  Bibliography  * Dahmen, Sabine: Leben und Werk der j√ºdischen K√ºnstlerin Lene Schneider-Kainer im Berlin der 20er Jahre. - Dortmund : Ed.
