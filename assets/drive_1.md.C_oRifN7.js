HistoryEarly sultanate (1858–85)= Founded in 1858 by the former ruler of the insular Pate sultanate after several abortive moves to the mainland, the native sultanate of Wituland was a haven for slaves fleeing the Zanzibar slave trade and thus a target of attacks from the Sultanate of Zanzibar (ruled by a branch of the Omani dynasty, under British protectorate). Facing an increase in slaving raids from the Sultanate of Zanzibar, the Sultan of Witu formally requested German protection so that he \\"finally has relief from the attacks of Zanzibar warriors.\\"German Wituland, a colonial rarity =German Protectorate (1885–90)= In 1885, the German brothers Clemens and Gustav Denhardt negotiated a treaty with Ahmed ibn Fumo Bakari, the first mfalme (Swahili for sultan or king) of Witu who ceded, on 8 April 1885, 25 square miles of territory to the brothers' \\"Tana Company\\", and the remainder of the Wituland became the German Protectorate of Wituland (Deutsch-Witu) on 27 May 1885. The Reich was represented there by the German Residents: Gustav Denhardt (1856–1917; in office 8 April 1885 – 1 July 1890) and his deputy Clemens Andreas Denhardt (1852–1928). German rule was relatively mild, and the territory continued being a haven for escaped slaves.German Wituland, a colonial rarity In 1889, Wituland issued a number of postage stamps although their postal usage has not been verified. =British Rule and the Witu Expeditions= Flag under British rule (31 July 1893 – 1920) In accord with the 1890 Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty, on 18 June 1890 a British protectorate was declared, and on 1 July 1890 imperial Germany renounced its protectorate, ceding the Wituland to Great Britain to become part of British East Africa. There were widespread protests from the inhabitants of the territory, who wished to remain under Germany's protection. First Expedition (1890) Shortly afterwards several German merchants were murdered,Witu 1890, A punitive expedition on the East African coast and a mixed British & Zanzibari punitive expedition was sent out. The troops landed and descended on Witu on October 26, 1890. After a series of shoot-outs, Sultan Fumo Bakari ibn Ahmad fled from the town, with roughly 3,000 of his remaining gunmen. He was deposed by the British and died soon afterwards. After a short reign by Bwana Shaykh ibn Ahmad, the rulership (now reduced to a shaykhdom and made a vassal of the Zanzibar Sultanate) was given to Fumo \`Umar (or \`Umari) ibn Ahamd. Slavery was also formally abolished in Witu, in March 1891, and Indian police were brought in to enforce the new agreement. Second Expedition (1893) A brother of Fumo Bakari, by the name of Fumo Oman, resisted the new regime and began leading increasingly violent raids on villages and farms around the nearby town of Jongeni, northeast of Witu. A brief attempt at diplomacy failed, and the British and Zanzibari governments prepared a second naval expedition to sail to Witu. A small expeditionary force landed at Witu in July and a second request to negotiate was sent to Fumo Oman. It was rejected and the marines marched on the principal towns under rebel control. Thick forest and camouflaged pits with sharpened stakes surrounded the strongly fortified towns, and the rebel gunmen had prepared defensive positions that allowed for heavy fire. However, after prolonged and intense shoot-outs, the naval marines fought their way into each town, and destroyed the fortifications.The Royal Navy and the East Coast of Africa 1890-1899 Fumo Oman fled and Fumo 'Umari bin Hamid was reinstated. Fumo 'Umari moved the capital to Jongeni, but the growth of British power and of the regional importance of Zanzibar saw Witu's position and independence gradually decline.Marina Tolmacheva, \\"Introduction\\" to The Pate Chronicle, ed. and tran. by Marina Tolmacheva (East lansing: Michigan State University, 1993) p. 1 End of Witu In 1905 oversight for Witu was moved from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office. From then Witu was administrated as a part of Tana District of the Kenya Coast Protectorate. Since the 1923 death of Umari bin Hamid the question of Witu as an entity of its own was finally closed. =List of rulers= The known ruling Sultans (styled mfalume in Swahili) are: *1858–1888: Ahmad ibn Fumo Bakari *1888–1890: Fumo Bakari ibn Ahmad *1890–1891: Bwana Shaykh ibn Ahmad *1891–1893: Fumo \`Umar ibn Ahmad (1st time) *1893 – 7 July 1895: Vacant *7 July 1895 – 1923: Fumo \`Umar ibn Ahmad (2nd time) NotesExternal links *German Wituland, a colonial rarity (archived link) *Map of German Protectorate of Witu (Deutsch-Witu) *WorldStatesmen- Kenya Category:Lamu County Category:Former German colonies Category:History of German East Africa Category:Former British colonies and protectorates in Africa Category:German colonisation in Africa Category:History of Kenya Category:Sultanates Category:States and territories established in 1858 Category:Former countries in Africa Category:1890 establishments in the British Empire ","title":"Wituland"},{"id":"2002257","text":"The half-collared kingfisher (Alcedo semitorquata) is a kingfisher in the subfamily Alcedininae that is found in southern and eastern Africa.

Davis (July 24, 1803 – January 14, 1892), was an American architect, known particularly for his association with the Gothic Revival style. Education Davis was born in New York City and studied at the American Academy of Fine Arts, the New-York Drawing Association, and from the Antique casts of the National Academy of Design. Dropping out of school, he became a respectable lithographer and from 1826 he worked as a draftsman for Josiah R. Brady, a New York architect who was an early exponent of the Gothic revival style: Brady's Gothic 1824 St. Luke's Episcopal Church is the oldest surviving structure in Rochester, New York. CareerPartnership with Ithiel Town= Davis made a first independent career as an architectural illustrator in the 1820s, but his friends, especially painter John Trumbull, convinced him to turn his hand to designing buildings. Picturesque siting, massing and contrasts remained essential to his work, even when he was building in a Classical style. In 1826, Davis went to work in the office of Ithiel Town and Martin E. Thompson, the most prestigious architectural firm of the Greek Revival; in the office Davis had access to the best architectural library in the country, in a congenial atmosphere where he gained a thorough grounding. From 1829, in partnership with Town, Davis formed the first recognizably modern architectural office and designed many late Classical buildings, including some of public prominence. In Washington, Davis designed the Executive Department offices and with Robert Mills the first Patent Office building (1834–36). He also designed the Custom House of New York City (1833–42). Bridgeport City Hall, constructed in 1853 and 1854, is a later government building Davis designed in the Classical style. A series of consultations over state capitols followed, none apparently built entirely as Davis planned: the Indiana State House, Indianapolis (1831 – 35), elicited calls for his advice and designs in building other state capitols in the 1830s: North Carolina's (1833 – 40, with local architect David Paton), the Illinois State Capitol, often attributed entirely to the Springfield, Illinois architect John F. Rague, who was at work on the Iowa State Capitol at the same time, and in 1839, the committee responsible for commissioning a design for the Ohio Statehouse asked his advice. The resulting capitol in Columbus, Ohio, often attributed to the Hudson River School painter Thomas Cole consulting with Davis and Ithiel Town, has a stark Greek Doric order colonnade across a recessed entrance, flanked by recessed window bays that continue the rhythm of the central portico, all under a unique drum capped by a low saucer dome. With Town's partner James Dakin, he designed the noble colossal Corinthian order of the Greek Revival \\"Colonnade Row\\" on New York's Lafayette Street, the very first apartments designed for the prosperous American middle class (1833, half still standing). Two years after its completion, Davis was hired to design the Dutch Reformed Church upriver in Newburgh, inspired by the Temple of Poseidon, both positioned for the viewing of maritime travelers. He continued in partnership with Town until shortly before Town's death in 1844. In 1831, he was elected an associate member of the National Academy. From 1835, Davis began work on his own on Rural Residences, his only publication, the first pattern book for picturesque residences in a domesticated Gothic Revival taste, which could be executed in carpentry, and also containing the first of the Italianate style \\"Tuscan\\" villas, flat-roofed with wide overhanging eaves and picturesque corner towers. Unfortunately the Panic of 1837 cut short his plans for a series of like volumes, but Davis soon formed a partnership with Andrew Jackson Downing, illustrating his widely read books. Additions to Vesper Cliff were built in 1834. See also: =Country residences (1840 - 1860) = The 1840s and 1850s were Davis's two most fruitful decades as a designer of country houses. His villa \\"Lyndhurst\\" at Tarrytown, New York, is his single most famous house. Many of his villas were built in the scenic Hudson River Valley— where his style informed the vernacular Hudson River Bracketed that gave Edith Wharton a title for a novel —but Davis sent plans and specifications to clients as far afield as Indiana. He designed Blandwood, the 1846 home of Governor John Motley Morehead that stands as America's earliest Italianate Tuscan Villa. Innovative interior features, including his designs for mantels and sideboards, were also widely imitated in the trade. Other influential interior details include pocket shutters at windows, bay windows, and mirrored surfaces to reflect natural light. The Greek Revival style William Walsh House was built at Albany, New York, and Gothic Revival style Belmead was built near Powhatan, Virginia, in 1845. Two smaller but well known structures designed by Davis include one built for John Cox Stevens in 1845; Stevens was the first Commodore of New York Yacht Club and the small Carpenter Gothic building on his property near Hoboken was given to NYYC to be used as its first clubhouse. This building, fondly called \\"Station 10\\", still exists and can be found in Newport. Davis built a similar pavilion for his colleague and fellow NYYC founder, John Clarkson Jay, on Jay's Long Island Sound waterfront property in Rye, New York, in 1849. Although this building was taken down in the 1950s, the original setting and garden where it was once located is part of a National Historic Landmark site and open to the public. Inspired in part by friend Andrew Jackson Downing, Davis constructed several Gothic Revival cottage-style homes in Central New York, including the 1852-completed Reuel E. Smith House, which is included in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1851, Davis completed Winyah Park, one of approximately eighteen or more Italianate houses he designed in the 1850s. Winyah was built for Richard Lathers, who had studied architecture with Davis in New York in the 1830s. It was situated on Lathers's estate in the town of New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York. For this design Davis won the first architectural prize at the New York World's Fair of 1853–54.Edwards, Lee M., et al. (1986). Bliss: Family Life in American Painting, 1840-1910, p. 38. The Hudson River Museum. He used its most striking feature, two adjacent yet contrasting towers, in a much larger house named Grace Hill, built in Brooklyn between 1853 and 1854. In both Winyah and Grace Hill, broad octagonal towers serve as visual anchors for the taller square towers. Lathers later employed Davis to design four additional \\"investment houses\\" on his property which became known as \\"Lathers's Hill\\". The homes included two Gothic cottages and \\"Tudor Villa\\" constructed in 1858, and \\"Pointed Villa\\" constructed in 1859. In 1890, the artist Frederic Remington purchased one of these cottages from which he created his estate \\"Endion\\", which served as the studio for most of his artistic career.Study of a New York Suburb - New Rochelle, Architectural Record 1909 The success of \\"Winyah Park\\" and \\"Lathers's Hill\\" generated other important commissions for Davis in New Rochelle, including two cottage-villas, Wildcliff and Sans Souci, which he designed for members of a prominent Davenport family. Both homes feature Davis's signature central gable. Another extant Gothic Revival commission is Whitby Castle, designed in 1852 for Davis' lifelong friend William Chapman. The building is part of the Boston Post Road Historic District (Rye, New York) and retains many original features. Davis was invited to become a member of the American Institute of Architects shortly after its founding in 1857. In the late 1850s, Davis worked with the entrepreneur Llewellyn S. Haskell to create Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, a garden suburb that was one of the first planned residential communities in the United States. Davis designed buildings for the University of Michigan in 1838, and in the 1840s he designed buildings for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. At Virginia Military Institute, Jackson's designs from 1848 through the 1850s created the first entirely Gothic revival college campus, built in brick and stuccoed to imitate stone.Mary Ann Sullivan, Clayton Hall, Virginia Military Institute Barracks Davis's plan for the Barracks quadrangle was interrupted by the Civil War; it was sympathetically completed to designs of Bertram Goodhue in the early 20th century. He married Margaret Beale in 1853 and had two children. =Declining patronage and retirement (1860 - 1892)= With the onset of Civil War in 1861, patronage in house building dried up, and after the war, new styles unsympathetic to Davis's nature were in vogue. In 1867, he designed the Hurst-Pierrepont Estate. In 1878, Davis closed his office. He built little in the last thirty years of his life, but spent his easy retirement in West Orange drawing plans for grandiose schemes that he never expected to build, and selecting and ordering his designs and papers, by which he determined to be remembered. They are shared by four New York institutions: the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University, the New York Public Library, the New-York Historical Society, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A further collection of Davis material has been assembled at the Henry Francis DuPont Winterthur Museum library.

History The CDP opened on October 2, 1889, at a site along the west bank of the Hillsborough River in the rural community of Parkdale (amalgamated into Charlottetown in 1996). The facility soon established itself as one of the premiere race tracks in eastern Canada. The track is an oval dirt surface standardbred race course. Its original judge's stand built in 1889 still stands on the inner field, having been restored in 1999. The starting gate, dating to 1948 and the first of its kind in Canada, was also restored to operational use in 1999. During the third week of August, the CDP hosts \\"Old Home Week\\", Prince Edward Island's annual provincial agricultural exhibition running 15 racing programs over 9 days. A newer tradition since 1960, \\"Old Home Week\\" culminates in the running of the \\"Gold Cup and Saucer\\" finale at the end of the exhibition - a race which has drawn celebrities and royalty and locals alike. The CDP grandstand originally housed a restaurant and enclosed and open viewing areas for both winter and temperate season racing. In 1990, the adjacent Charlottetown Civic Centre was built onto the CDP complex. A fire in the early 1990s among the wood-constructed horse stables led to the building of many new concrete stables, although urban development pressures around the CDP site may lead to horse owners being forced to practice their animals at another site on the outskirts of Charlottetown, leaving the CDP as primarily a race facility. The roof of the CDP grandstand was heavily damaged by Hurricane Juan on September 29, 2003. This development is believed to have spurred the CDP's redevelopment by the provincial government into a so-called racino. =Red Shores Racetrack and Casino= Faced with declining revenues for race betting, the provincial government looked at options for redeveloping the CDP. Following damage to the facility by Hurricane Juan, the government entered into an agreement with the Atlantic Lottery Corporation and have been redeveloping the CDP with an improved track, lighting and a gaming facility containing Electronic Gaming Devices (EGD); such facilities are commonly termed racinos. The gaming area is referred to as an Entertainment Centre, the name of the entire facility was referred to as the Charlottetown Driving Park Entertainment Centre (CDPEC) but in mid 2009 the names of the Charlottetown and Summerside facilities were rebranded as Red Shores Racetrack and Casino. The gaming floor in Charlottetown has 208 slot machines; including 40 stand- alone progressive slots, four linked progressives, a self-serve simulcast betting area and five Texas Hold 'Em Poker tables featuring a Royal Flush Progressive Jackpot and two blackjack tables. Summerside has 40 slot machines and two Texas Hold 'Em poker tables. The CDPEC held the two biggest outdoor concerts ever on PEI. In 2006, hosting the Black Eyed Peas, Pussycat Dolls and others.

According to Hindu beliefs, the river is the daughter of Rishi Vashist and bathing in the Gomti on Ekadashi (the eleventh day of the two lunar phases of the Hindu calendar month) can wash away sins. According to Bhagavata Purana one of Hinduism's major religious works, the Gomti is one of India's transcendental rivers. The rare Gomti Chakra is found there. Geography The banks of the Gomti in Jaunpur The Gomti, a monsoon- and groundwater-fed river, originates from Gomat Taal (formally known as Fulhaar jheel) near Madho Tanda, Pilibhit, India. It extends through Uttar Pradesh and meets the Ganges near Saidpur, Kaithi, from Varanasi district. It meets a small river, the Gaihaaee, from its origin. The Gomti is a narrow stream until it reaches Mohammadi Kheri, a tehsil of Lakhimpur Kheri district (about from its origin), where it is joined by tributaries such as the Sukheta, Choha and Andhra Choha. The river is then well-defined, with the Kathina tributary joining it at Mailani and Sarayan joining it at a village in Sitapur district. A major tributary is the Sai River, which joins the Gomti near Jaunpur. The Markandey Mahadeo temple is at the confluence of the Gomti and the Ganges. After the Gomti enters Lucknow, meandering through the city for about and supplying its water. In the Lucknow area, 25 city drains pour untreated sewage into the river. At the downstream end, the Gomti barrage converts the river into a lake. In addition to Lucknow, Gola Gokaran Nath, Misrikh, Neemsar, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sultanpur Kerakat and Jaunpur, Zafarabad are the most prominent of the 20 towns in the river's catchment basin. The river cuts the Sultanpur district and Jaunpur in half, becoming wider in the city. Pollution The Gomti in Sitapur district The Gomti River is polluted at several points of its course through the stretch of alluvial plains in Uttar Pradesh. The major sources of pollution are industrial waste and effluent from sugar factories and distilleries and residential wastewater and sewage. The river and its tributaries, such as Kukrail Drainage, collect large amounts of human and industrial pollutants as they flow through an area of about 18 million people. High pollution levels threaten the Gomti's aquatic life. On 25 July 2008, the foundation stone of a -capacity sewage treatment plant was laid. The plant, promoted as Asia's largest, failed; in 2014 it was reportedly running at 10 percent of capacity, and beyond the plant (near Bharwara) untreated sewage and solid waste entered the river. The plant was intended to intercept the 23 major natural drains entering the Gomti. Riverfront development controversy Temporary dam stopping the Gomti River for construction on the riverbed Gomti riverfront, with heavy machinery over the riverbed and floodplain Gomti riverfront reclaimed riverbed and floodplain The Gomti has been stressed, particularly in and around Lucknow, for decades. There are three major issues: # Embankments - High embankments were built around the river to protect the population of Lucknow after a major flood during 1970s, altering the Gomti's natural floodplain. # Pollution - The Gomti has 40 natural drains, of which 23 are major. The drains, which carried surplus water into the river during the monsoon and recharged the underground water table, were reduced to carry residential and industrial sewage into the river. # Development - The river's floodplains and fertile land were covered with residential areas, such as Gomti Nagar and Triveni Nagar. The Gomti began receding during the late 1970s, and was under major stress in 2016. Although government agencies planned major projects, such as the Bharwara sewage treatment plant and mechanical dredging, most were unsuccessful. The Gomti rises by 10–12 meters during the monsoon, and in 2008 a major flood was reported. Around 2012, the newly-elected government and the Lucknow Development Authority began a feasibility study with the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee to build a river-front similar to Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad. The LDA submitted the report, warning about the negative consequences of reducing the Gomti to less than 250 meters wide. At 250 meters wide (with walls on both sides), the river's velocity would increase by 20 percent and its bed-shear stress by 30 percent. Current embankments would have to be raised by 1.5 meters, and the high flood level (HFL) would increase by 1.25 meters. Two bridges would be threatened with collapse under flood conditions. The plan was given to the irrigation department, which signed a memorandum of understanding with IIT Roorkee in December 2015 to conduct a similar study on the project. The riverfront- development project is seen as a political showdown between the state government and the ruling party, whose similar construction in Ahmedabad over the Sabarmati River has been projected as a showcase of development in the state of Gujarat.

History  The company was founded in 1928 by Wood T. and Louise Brookshire, when they opened their first 25 x store on Tyler’s downtown square. Brookshire's was originally part of the Brookshire Brothers chain, which was founded seven years earlier in Lufkin, Texas. The companies split in 1939, when Wood T. Brookshire took control of the Tyler-area stores in exchange for his share in the Brookshire Brothers partnership.\\"Brookshire Grocery Company.\\" The Handbook of Texas Online. Retrieved on February 13, 2011. The companies are no longer related except by name. In the 1940s, the company expanded to other neighboring communities and opened its first shopping center location. Brookshire’s first warehouse opened in Tyler in 1953. The 1960s saw the company's expansion into Louisiana and the construction of a distribution center in Tyler. Brookshire's grocery store in Overton, Texas Brookshire's grocery store in Commerce, Texas Super 1 Foods grocery store in Corsicana, Texas In 1984, the company opened the first of several Super 1 Foods stores in Alexandria, LA. Super 1 Foods was originally a no-frills, warehouse format. Initially, stores were opened in recycled buildings to cut down on cost, but later the company began building stores on their own. In several cases (#608 in Shreveport and #612 in Longview), existing Brookshire's stores were closed and demolished to build a Super 1 Foods store. In Marshall and Longview, existing Brookshire's stores were converted to the Super 1 format. The company opened several Super 1 Foods stores in the Dallas/Fort Worth area in the late 1990s and early 2000s, some of which were replacements for nearby Brookshire's locations. The company sold all metro area stores to (now defunct) Fleming, which re-branded them as Rainbow Foods. All Rainbow stores were closed when Fleming went out of business. In 2012, a new format Super 1 Foods store was built in Carencro, LA., with a new floorplan and decor package that would be rolled out to all the other stores. A similar store was built to replace #610 in Tyler. The Brookshire Grocery Company also opened FRESH by Brookshire's in Tyler, TX on March 10, 2011. The store was designed to give an upscale shopping experience and features a bakery and many organic items. The first annual FRESH 15 Road Race was held on March 1, 2014 and continues yearly. Along with the FRESH 15, Brookshire’s and Super 1 Foods host a half marathon, 5K and Kids 1K named Heroes Run, benefiting local first responders and military heroes. This event takes place in Shreveport, LA with 1,500 participants in 2016 raising $40,000 for charity. In June 2016 Brookshire's purchased 25 stores formerly owned by Wal-Mart (formerly their Wal-Mart Express brand). The stores, located in Texas (20 stores) and Louisiana (five stores) were re-branded as Spring Market (the name taken from Brookshire's first location on Spring Avenue in Tyler).  Today  Today the company has more than 14,000 employee/partners at over 150 locations. BGC has four brands: Brookshire's, Super 1 Foods, Fresh by Brookshire's, and Spring Market. The company also operates three distribution facilities — two based in Tyler, TX, and one in Monroe, LA — with more than 2 million total square feet and a company fleet of 72 tractors and more than 300 trailers. BGC’s internal manufacturing facilities include bakery, dairy, ice cream, yogurt, fresh-cut, ice and water/drink plants, all in the Tyler area. Mississippi operations In 2002, Brookshire's bought four Albertsons stores in Mississippi. These stores were located at 5841 Ridgewood Road in North Jackson, 2861 Terry Road in South Jackson, 7045 Old Canton Road in Ridgeland and 143 Albertsons Drive in Flowood. The North Jackson store was the newest of the four locations, having opened in 2001, while the other area stores in South Jackson, Flowood, and Ridgeland opened in 1997. On February 11, 2010, after a decline in market grocery shares against Kroger and Walmart, Brookshire's exited Mississippi with a sale of the Flowood and Ridgeland stores to Kroger and the closure of the two Jackson stores. In late 2011, Brookshire's sold their South Jackson store to Kosciusko, MS based supermarket chain Food Depot, operated by Potter and Sims Foods. The North Jackson location was converted into a Virginia College location. Virginia College closed in December 2018. The former grocery store remains vacant.

These registers include modal voice (or normal voice), vocal fry, falsetto, and the whistle register. Registers originate in laryngeal function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular range of pitches and produces certain characteristic sounds. In speech pathology, the vocal register has three components: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Although this view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogists, others define vocal registration more loosely than in the sciences, using the term to denote various theories of how the human voice changes, both subjectively and objectively, as it moves through its pitch range. There are many divergent theories on vocal registers within vocal pedagogy, making the term somewhat confusing and at times controversial within the field of singing. Vocal pedagogists may use the term vocal register to refer to any of the following: A labeled anatomical diagram of the vocal folds or cords. * a particular part of the vocal range such as the upper, middle, or lower registers * a resonance area such as chest voice or head voice * a phonatory process * a certain vocal timbre * a region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks Manuel Garcia II in the late nineteenth century was one of the first to develop a scientific definition of registers, a definition that is still used by pedagogues and vocal teachers today. :\\"A register is a series of homogeneous sounds produced by one mechanism, differing essentially from another series of equally homogeneous sounds produced by another mechanism.\\"Garcia, Manuel. Hints on Singing. London: E. Ascherberg, 1894. Print. Another definition is from Clifton Ware in the 1990s. :\\"A series of distinct, consecutive, homogeneous vocal tones that can be maintained in pitch and loudness throughout a certain range.\\"Ware, Clifton. Basics of Vocal Pedagogy: The Foundations and Process of Singing. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1998. Print. A register consists of the homogeneous tone qualities produced by the same mechanical system whereas registration is the process of using and combining the registers to achieve artistic singing. For example: a skilled singer moves through their range and dynamics smoothly, so that you are unaware of register changes. This process could be described as good or clean registration.Ware, Clifton. Basics of Vocal Pedagogy: The Foundations and Process of Singing. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1998. Print. The term \\"register\\" originated in the sixteenth century. Before then it was recognized that there were different \\"voices\\". As teachers started to notice how different the ranges on either side of the passaggios or breaks in the voice were, they were compared to different sets of pipes in an organ. These clusters of pipes were called registers, so the same term was adopted for voices.Alderson, Richard. Complete Handbook of Voice Training. West Nyack, NY: Parker Pub., 1979. Print. Vibratory patterns Vocal registers arise from different vibratory patterns produced by the vocal cords. Research by speech pathologists and some vocal pedagogists has revealed that the vocal cords are capable of producing at least four distinct vibratory forms, although not all persons can produce all of them. The first of these vibratory forms is known as natural or normal voice; another name for it is modal voice, which is widely used in both speech pathology and vocal pedagogy publications. In this usage, modal refers to the natural disposition or manner of action of the vocal cords. The other three vibratory forms are known as vocal fry, falsetto, and whistle. Each of these four registers has its own vibratory pattern, its own pitch range (although there is some overlap), and its own characteristic sound. Arranged by the pitch ranges covered, vocal fry is the lowest register, modal voice is next, then falsetto, and finally the whistle register. While speech pathologists and scholars of phonetics recognize four registers, vocal pedagogists are divided. Indiscriminate use of the word register has led to confusion and controversy about the number of registers in the human voice within vocal pedagogical circles. This controversy does not exist within speech pathology and the other sciences, because vocal registers are viewed from a purely physiological standpoint concerned with laryngeal function. Writers concerned with the art of singing state that there are anywhere from one to seven registers present. The diversity of opinion is wide with no consensus. The prevailing practice within vocal pedagogy is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are designated \\"chest\\", \\"head\\", and \\"falsetto\\" and women's voices are \\"chest\\", \\"middle\\", and \\"head\\". This way of classifying registers, however, is not universally accepted. Many vocal pedagogists blame this confusion on the incorrect use of the terms \\"chest register\\" and \\"head register\\". These professionals argue that, since all registers originate in laryngeal function, it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. The vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms \\"chest voice\\" and \\"head voice\\" over the term register. Many of the problems described as register problems are actually problems of resonance adjustment. This helps to explain the multiplicity of registers which some vocal pedagogists advocate. For more information on resonance, see Vocal resonation. The confusion which exists concerning the definition and number of registers is due in part to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest pitches of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones. If a singer holds any of these factors constant and interferes with their progressive state of change, her laryngeal function tends to become static and eventually breaks occur, with obvious changes of tone quality. These breaks are often identified as register boundaries or as transition areas between registers. The distinct change or break between registers is called a passaggio or a ponticello.The Oxford Dictionary of Opera. John Warrack and Ewan West, Vocal pedagogists teach that, with study, a singer can move effortlessly from one register to another with ease and consistent tone. Registers can even overlap while singing. Teachers who prefer the theory of \\"blending registers\\" usually help students through the \\"passage\\" from one register to another by hiding their \\"lift\\" (where the voice changes). However, many pedagogists disagree with this distinction of boundaries blaming such breaks on vocal problems which have been created by a static laryngeal adjustment that does not permit the necessary changes to take place. This difference of opinion has affected the different views on vocal registration. Vocal fry register The vocal fry register is the lowest vocal register and is produced through a loose glottal closure which will permit air to bubble through with a popping or rattling sound of a very low frequency. The chief use of vocal fry in singing is to obtain pitches of very low frequency which are not available in modal voice. This register may be used therapeutically to improve the lower part of the modal register. This register is not used often in singing, but male quartet pieces, and certain styles of folk music for both men and women have been known to do so. Modal voice register The modal voice is the usual register for speaking and singing, and the vast majority of both are done in this register. As pitch rises in this register, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their edges become thinner. A well-trained singer or speaker can phonate two octaves or more in the modal register with consistent production, beauty of tone, dynamic variety, and vocal freedom. This is possible only if the singer or speaker avoids static laryngeal adjustments and allows the progression from the bottom to the top of the register to be a carefully graduated continuum of readjustments. Falsetto register The falsetto register lies above the modal voice register and overlaps the modal register by approximately one octave. The characteristic sound of falsetto is flute-like with few overtones present. The essential difference between the modal and falsetto registers lies in the amount and type of vocal cord involvement. The falsetto voice is produced by the vibration of the ligamentous edges of the vocal cords, in whole or in part, and the main body of the fold is more or less relaxed. In contrast, the modal voice involves the whole vocal cord with the glottis opening at the bottom first and then at the top. The falsetto voice is also more limited in dynamic variation and tone quality than the modal voice. Whistle register The whistle register is the highest register of the human voice. The whistle register is so called because the timbre of the notes that are produced from this register are similar to that of a whistle or the upper notes of a flute, whereas the modal register tends to have a warmer, less shrill timbre.

Although proud of the design, Chambers was never able to visit the completed building, as he was constantly employed in England. Name The name 'Casino' is the diminutive form of the 18th-century Italian word 'Casa' meaning 'House', thus 'Little House',Collins English Dictionary, 1999 and is not used in the modern sense of \\"gambling establishment\\". After his 9-year Grand Tour of Italy and Greece, Caulfield was taken with all things Italian, and decided to add a 'little house' to his estate, which he had already named after the town of Marino in Lazio. Design Widely regarded as the most important Neo-Classical building in Ireland, the Casino is actually quite small, measuring only fifty feet square to the outer columns. In plan, it takes the form of a Greek Cross with a pair of columns framing each projecting elevation. Seen from the outside, the building has the appearance of a single roomed structure, with a large panelled door on the north elevation and a single large window on each of the other elevations. This is all illusion, however, as it actually contains 16 rooms on three floors. Only two of the panels in the door open to allow entrance, and the panes of glass in the windows are subtly curved, disguising the partitioning which allows what looks like a single window to serve several separate rooms. Many other tricks are used throughout the construction to preserve the apparent simplicity of the design. Four of the columns which surround the building are hollow and, with a length of chain dangling in each, allow rainwater to drain down. The Roman funerary urns on the roof (designed by James Gandon) are used as chimneys. The interior, by Simon Vierpyl, includes a basement level with a kitchen and associated rooms, a main floor with reception rooms and a top storey with servants' rooms and a State Bedroom. One of the rooms includes the Blue Salon. It includes a wooden parquet floor, with the Star of David in the centre, stucco work on the ceiling and a white marble fireplace. It contains some very fine plasterwork ceilings and some elaborate hardwood parquet floors.http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/5439/VIERPYL,+SIMON+* Originally the Casino was linked to Marino House by a tunnel, although this has been blocked off due to building works in the area. Gardens The Casino is all that remains of the eighteenth-century garden demesne at Marino with the original Marino House demolished in the 1920s. Described by Charles T. Bowden in his Travel Guide of 1791 as a 'terrestrial paradise', the design of the landscape was inspired by Lord Charlemont's extensive Grand Tour. History The tunnel at the Casino was used as a shooting range by Irish revolutionaries including Michael Collins in the 1920s.

Action T4 In early 1939 a farm labourer called Richard Kretschmar requested Catel's permission to euthanise one of his children, now identified as Gerhard Kretschmar, who had been born blind and deformed. Catel deferred the matter and suggested the father write directly to Hitler for permission. Hitler subsequently sent Dr. Karl Brandt to confer with Catel and decide on a course of action. On July 25, 1939 the child was killed. The T4 program was influenced by a popular book, Allowing the destruction of life unworthy of living, written in 1920 by Alfred Hoche and Karl Binding. Catel as part of this programme was probably influenced by it too. In his 1962 publication, Grenzsituation des Lebens (Border situations of life), Catel argued for the reintroduction of euthanasia. As had Binding and Hoche, Catel identified three possible types of euthanasia. *Reine Euthanasie: \\"Real\\" euthanasia was seen as the killing of a person who was suffering from so much pain, that an ever-increasing amount of pain reducing drugs had to be administered. This consequently lead to the person's death. *Euthanasie im engeren Sinne: The killing of a patient whose illness \\"according to medical experience\\" is so bad \\"that there is no hope of recovery\\", but whose death is also not to be expected in the near future. (See terminal sedation) *Euthanasie im weiteren Sinne: The \\"extermination of the life of an \\"idiot child\\" or an adult in a similar condition. Catel defined \\"idiot children\\" as being \\"such monsters ... which are nothing but a massa carnis\\". Postwar career After the war Catel took charge of the Mammolshöhe Children's Mental Home near Kronberg, where he continued to rally for the euthanasia of children deemed beyond hope.

Early years Hadamovsky was born and raised in Berlin; he already joined the paramilitary Black Reichswehr forces when still being a secondary school student. When the Freikorps units were dissolved in 1921, hIs life became erratic; working as a locksmith and mechanic at varying places. Back in Berlin from 1928, he was an early Nazi supporter, who helped organize Nazi radio listeners and handled the technical details at many of Hitler's mass rallies. Hadamovsky joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1930; the party's propaganda leader Joseph Goebbels commissioned him to build up the right-wing Reichsverband Deutscher Rundfunkteilnehmer (\\"Reich association of German broadcasting participants\\"). Hitler's Rise to Power as Career Booster Shortly after the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, Hadamovsky served as the National Programming Director for the German Deutschlandsender broadcaster.Eugen Hadamovsky. German Propaganda Archive. Calvin University A few months later, he was appointed Reich production director and head of the nationalized Reichs-Rundfunk- Gesellschaft, whereby he played a vital role in the Nazi Gleichschaltung of the incorporated regional broadcasters. In 1935 he initiated the launch of the Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow TV station. Hadamovsky also served as vice-president of the broadcasting department in the Reichskulturkammer organization and in a variety of other posts during World War II. He was head of the radio department in the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda from 1940, however, Minister Goebbels was not entirely pleased with him, as is evident by many references in Goebbels' diaries. In 1942 Hadamovsky was replaced and took over the position as chief of staff in the Nazi Party's Central Propaganda Office (Reichspropagandaleitung) in Berlin. Author Hadamovsky authored seven propaganda books, the most significant of which was \\"Propaganda and National Power\\" (1933), the only book treating the general principles of propaganda published during the Third Reich.\\"Propaganda and National Power\\" on Google Books\\"Propaganda and National Power\\" German Propaganda Archive. Calvin College Other books include \\"World History on the March\\", which was published just before the 1939 Invasion of Poland, and applauded Nazi Germany in general and the return of the Memel Territory, Adolf Hitler's last negotiated territorial gain, previously lost to Lithuania after World War I. Hadamovsky was also author of Blitzmarsch nach Warschau: Frontberichte eines politischen Soldaten (Lightning March to Warsaw: Front Reports of a Political Soldier), an eyewitness account of the Invasion of Poland (1939). Military Service and Death In 1943, Hadamovsky volunteered for the Wehrmacht armed forces.Eugen Hadamovsky.

From its founding in 1877 until October 2009, the company was headquartered in Moss, Norway. History Helly Juell Hansen had been at sea since the age of 14 and in 1877, at the age of 35, he and his wife Maren Margarethe began producing oilskin jackets, trousers, sou'westers and tarpaulins, made from coarse linen soaked in linseed oil. Over the first five years they sold around 10,000 pieces. In 1878 the company won a diploma for excellence at the Paris Expo, and began exporting its products. After Helly Juell Hansen's death in 1914, company leadership passed on to his son Helly Hansen, an experienced merchant. In the 1920s a new fabric, which Helly Hansen called Linox, was developed. Over the next 30 years the name Linox would transfer to a PVC (polyvinyl chloride) application. A change for the brand came in 1949 when Helox was developed. The sheet of translucent PVC plastic sewn into waterproof coats and hats became a popular item. About 30,000 Helox coats were produced each month. Plarex, a heavier-duty version of Helox, backed by fabric, was developed for workwear. A product developed for the outdoor and workwear markets was Fibrepile which is an insulation layer for wearing under waterproofs. It was used by Swedish lumbermen, who discovered that it offered insulation against the cold, and ventilated well during hard, physical work in the forest. The layering story was completed in the 1970s, with the development of LIFA. The polypropylene fibre used in LIFA kept the skin dry and warm by pushing moisture away from the body, making it the ideal base-layer fabric for outdoor and workwear use. It was the birth of the three-layer systems of dress with LIFA close to the body, Fibrepile as an insulation layer, and rainwear for protection. During the 1970s the company developed survival suits for offshore oil workers in the North Sea. In 1980 the company's breathable, waterproof fabric system, called Helly Tech, was launched. Helly Tech garments use both hydrophilic and microporous technology. Hydrophilic garments have water-loving molecular chains which pass water vapor to the outside. Microporous garments have tiny pores that allow water vapor to pass out of the fabric without letting rain droplets in. Helly Hansen clothing developed a following among urban youth in the late 1990s, particularly in North England and with the hip hop culture in the US.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/helly-hansen- jacket-craze-sparks- violence/2012/11/30/14eb8cbc-38d1-11e2-a263-f0ebffed2f15_story_1.html The brand developed a mass appeal and is now sold in sports shops, not only the hiking and specialized clothing shops of before. In 2008 they launched, Odin a 3-Layer materialization system made for mountaineers. The Odin collection won the Red Dot Design Award the same year. In 2012, Helly Hansen introduced their H2 Flow Technology with the H2 Flow Jacket. The H2 Flow Jacket allows the wearer to regulate their body temperature. Company takeovers By 1995, the company was owned by Norwegian conglomerate Orkla. That year, Orkla sold a 50% stake in Helly Hansen to Resource Group International, which merged with Aker in 1996. In 1997, Investcorp bought Aker's stake and most of Orkla's stake, giving it 70% ownership. The company was valued at $160 million. In October 2006, Investcorp sold its interest in Helly Hansen to Altor Equity Partners, \\"a private equity firm focusing on investments in companies based in the Nordic region.\\" In 2012, Altor sold a 75% stake in Helly Hansen to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.Private equity deals: July 16, 2012 In 2015 the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan increased its position, acquiring Altor's remaining stock in the business. In May 2018, the pension plan sold the company to Canadian Tire, a retailer, for 985 million. Partnerships In February 2011, a three-year partnership with guiding company Mountain Madness was announced. The agreement between the companies meant that Helly Hansen would be outfitting all of Mountain Madness operations guides \\"with technical apparel from head to toe\\" beginning the 2011 season and extending through 2013. In November 2012, Helly Hansen partnered with the US Ski and Snowboard Association to be their official baselayer provider.USSA Names Helly Hansen Official Baselayer http://my.ussa.org/news/ussa-names-helly-hansen-official- baselayer The US Alpine Ski Team wore Helly Hansen baselayer while competing in Sochi.

It often describes the presence of immature cells such as myeloblasts or red blood cells with nuclei in the peripheral blood. It may be lymphoid or myeloid.

The peripheral blood smear may show myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and rarely myeloblasts; however, there is a mixture of early mature neutrophil precursors, in contrast to the immature forms typically seen in acute leukemia. Serum leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is normal or elevated in leukemoid reaction, but is depressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The bone marrow in a leukemoid reaction, if examined, may be hypercellular but is otherwise typically unremarkable. Leukemoid reactions are generally benign and are not dangerous in and of themselves, although they are often a response to a significant disease state (see Causes above). However, leukemoid reactions can resemble more serious conditions such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which can present with identical findings on the peripheral blood smear.Historically, various clues including the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and the presence of basophilia were used to distinguish CML from a leukemoid reaction. However, at present the test of choice in adults to distinguish CML is an assay for the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, either via cytogenetics and FISH, or via PCR for the BCR/ABL fusion gene. The LAP (Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase) score is high in reactive states but is low in CML. In cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, a qualified hematologist or oncologist should be consulted. Treatment Treatment of underlying condition. If drug induced, discontinue drug. If the reaction is found to be from anything besides drug use, certain anti neoplastic drugs may be indicated.

Compared to the more common solution NMR spectroscopy, ssNMR usually requires additional hardware for high-power radio-frequency irradiation and magic-angle spinning. IntroductionBasic concepts= The resonance frequency of a nuclear spin depends on the strength of the magnetic field at the nucleus, which can be modified by the electron cloud or the proximity of another spin. In general, these local fields are orientation dependent. In media with no or little mobility (e.g. crystalline powders, glasses, large membrane vesicles, molecular aggregates), anisotropic local fields or interactions have substantial influence on the behaviour of nuclear spins. In contrast, in a classical liquid-state NMR experiment, Brownian motion averages anisotropic interactions to zero and they are therefore not reflected in the NMR spectrum. =Examples of anisotropic nuclear interactions= Two directionally dependent interactions commonly found in solid-state NMR are the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) induced by the electron cloud around the nucleus and the dipolar coupling to other nuclear spins. More such interactions exist, in particular the quadrupolar coupling of nuclei with spin quantum number >1/2 and dipolar couplings to electron spins. The anisotropic J-coupling is usually too small to be detected. The g-tensor is an anisotropic interaction in electron spin resonance. In mathematical terms, all these interactions can be described using the same formalism. =Experimental background= Anisotropic interactions modify the local fields and nuclear spin energy levels (and hence the resonance frequency) of nuclei in a molecule, and often contribute to line broadening in NMR spectra. Nevertheless, there is a range of situations when their presence either cannot be avoided, or is even particularly desired, as they encode structural parameters, such as orientation information, on chemical bonds of interest. High-resolution conditions in solids (in a wider sense) can be established using magic angle spinning (MAS), macroscopic sample orientation, combinations of both of these techniques, and a variety of radio frequency (RF) irradiation patterns. While the latter allows decoupling of interactions in spin space, the others facilitate averaging of interactions in real space. In addition, line-broadening effects from microscopic inhomogeneities can be reduced by appropriate methods of sample preparation. Under magic-angle spinning conditions, isotropic interactions can report on the local structure, e.g. by the isotropic chemical shift. In addition, decoupled interactions can be selectively re-introduced (\\"recoupling\\"), and used, for example, for controlled de-phasing or transfer of polarization to derive a number of structural parameters such as internuclear distances. =Solid-state NMR line widths= The residual line width (full width at half maximum) of 13C nuclei under MAS conditions at 5–15 kHz spinning frequency and strong 1H decoupling by radio-frequency irradiation is typically on the order of 0.3–2 ppm. Even at MAS rates of 20 kHz and above, however, nonlinear groups of the same nuclei (i.e. not on a straight line) linked via homonuclear dipolar interactions can only be suppressed partially, leading to 1H NMR line widths of 0.5 ppm and above, which is considerably more than in optimal solution state NMR conditions. Other interactions such as the quadrupolar interaction can lead to line widths of thousands of ppm due to the strength of the interaction. The first-order quadrupolar broadening is largely suppressed by sufficiently fast MAS, but the second-order quadrupolar broadening has a different angular dependence and cannot be removed by spinning at one angle alone. Ways to achieve line shapes without anisotropy-induced broadening for quadrupolar nuclei include spinning at two angles simultaneously (DOR, DOuble angle Rotation), sequentially (DAS), or through refocusing the second-order quadrupolar interaction with a two-dimensional experiment such as MQMAS or STMAS. =Anisotropic interactions in solution-state NMR= From the perspective of solution-state NMR, it can be desirable to limit motional averaging of dipolar interactions by alignment media. The resulting residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are typically only a few Hz in magnitude, but do not destroy high-resolution conditions and provide a wealth of information, in particular on the orientation of molecular domains with respect to each other. =Dipolar truncation= The dipolar coupling between two nuclei is inversely proportional to the cube of their distance. The fairly slow polarization transfer mediated by the dipolar interaction between two distant spins of the same kind, e.g. 13C, is dramatically slowed down by a strong coupling to a third such nucleus nearby. This usually undesirable effect is commonly referred to as dipolar truncation. It has been one of the major obstacles in efficient extraction of internuclear distances, which are crucial in the structural analysis of biomolecular structure. By means of isotope labeling schemes or radio-frequency pulse sequences, however, it has become possible to circumvent this problem in a number of ways. Another way of circumventing dipolar truncation is to study rare nuclei like 13C at their low natural isotopic abundance utilising DNP-assisted MAS NMR, where the probability of an interfering third spin nearby is almost 100 times lower. Nuclear spin interactions in the solid phaseChemical shielding= The chemical shielding is a local property of each nuclear site in a molecule or compound, and is proportional to the applied external magnetic field. Specifically, the external magnetic field induces currents of the electrons in molecular orbitals. These induced currents create local magnetic fields that lead to characteristic changes in nuclear resonance frequency. These changes can be predicted from molecular structure using empirical rules or quantum-chemical calculations. Under sufficiently fast magic angle spinning, or in solution- state NMR, the directionally dependent character of the chemical shielding is time-averaged to zero, leaving only the isotropic chemical shift. =J-coupling= The J-coupling or indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling (sometimes also called \\"scalar\\" coupling despite the fact that J is a tensor quantity) describes the interaction of nuclear spins through chemical bonds. =Dipolar coupling= Vectors important for dipolar coupling Nuclear spins exhibit a magnetic dipole moment, which generates a magnetic field that interacts with the dipole moments of other nuclei (dipolar coupling). The magnitude of the interaction is dependent on the spin species, the internuclear distance r, and the orientation, with respect to the external magnetic field B, of the vector connecting the two nuclear spins (see figure). The maximum dipolar coupling is given by the dipolar coupling constant d, : d = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\mu_0}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_1 \\\\gamma_2}{r^3} , where γ1 and γ2 are the gyromagnetic ratios of the nuclei. In a strong magnetic field, the dipolar coupling depends on the angle θ between the internuclear vector and the external magnetic field B (see the figure) according to : D \\\\propto 3\\\\cos^2\\\\theta - 1. D becomes zero for \\\\theta = \\\\arccos \\\\sqrt{1/3}= \\\\arctan \\\\sqrt{2} = 54.7°. Consequently, two nuclei with a dipolar coupling vector at an angle of θm = 54.7° to a strong external magnetic field have zero dipolar coupling. θm is called the magic angle. One technique for removing dipolar couplings, at least relatively weak ones, is magic angle spinning. =Quadrupolar interaction= Nuclei with a spin quantum number >1/2 have a non-spherical charge distribution. This is known as a quadrupolar nucleus. A non spherical charge distribution can interact with an electric field gradient caused by some form of non-symmetry (e.g. in a trigonal bonding atom there are electrons around it in a plane, but not above or below it) to produce a change in the energy level in addition to the Zeeman effect. The quadrupolar interaction is the largest interaction in NMR apart from the Zeeman interaction, and they can even become comparable in size. The quadrupole coupling is so large that, unlike most other interactions, it cannot be treated to just the first order. This means you have a first and second order interaction, which can be treated separately. The first order interaction has an angular dependency with respect to the magnetic field of (3\\\\cos^2\\\\theta - 1)/2 (the P2 Legendre polynomial), this means that spinning the sample around an axis making an angle of 54.7° with the external field averages out the first-order interaction over one rotation period (other local interactions, including chemical shift, paramagnetic coupling, and J-coupling, also have this angular dependency). However, the second-order quadrupolar interaction depends on the P4 Legendre polynomial, which has zero points at 30.6° and 70.1°. These can be taken advantage of by either using DOR (DOuble angle Rotation) where you spin at two angles at the same time, or DAS (Double Angle Spinning) where you switch quickly between the two angles. Specialized hardware (probe) has been developed for such experiments. A revolutionary advance is Lucio Frydman's multiple quantum magic angle spinning (MQMAS) NMR in 1995 and it has become a routine method for obtaining high resolution solid-state NMR spectra of quadrupolar nuclei. A similar method to MQMAS is satellite transisition magic angle spinning (STMAS) NMR proposed by Zhehong Gan in 2000. =Other interactions= Paramagnetic substances are subject to the Knight shift.

History of discoveries of NMR phenomena, and the development of solid-state NMR spectroscopy: Purcell, Torrey and Pound: \\"nuclear induction\\" on 1H in paraffin 1945, at about the same time Bloch et al. on 1H in water. Modern solid-state NMR spectroscopy Methods and techniques =Basic example= CP pulse sequence A fundamental RF pulse sequence and a building-block in many solid-state NMR experiments starts with cross-polarization (CP) . It can be used to enhance the signal of nuclei with a low gyromagnetic ratio (e.g. 13C, 15N) by magnetization transfer from nuclei with a high gyromagnetic ratio (e.g. 1H), or as a spectral editing method (e.g. directed 15N→13C CP in protein spectroscopy). To establish magnetization transfer, the RF pulses applied on the two frequency channels must fulfill the Hartmann–Hahn condition , that is, the nutation frequencies in both rf fields must be identical. Experimental optimization of this condition is one of the routine tasks in performing a (solid-state) NMR experiment. CP is a basic building block of most pulse sequences in solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Given its importance, a pulse sequence employing direct excitation of 1H spin polarization, followed by CP transfer to and signal detection of 13C, 15N or similar nuclei, is itself often referred to as CP experiment, or, in conjunction with MAS, as CP-MAS . It is the typical starting point of an investigation using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. =Decoupling= Spin interactions must be removed (decoupled) to increase the resolution of NMR spectra and isolate spin systems. A technique that can substantially reduce or remove the chemical shift anisotropy and relatively weak dipolar couplings is sample rotation (most commonly magic angle spinning, but also off-magic angle spinning). Heteronuclear decoupling by radio-frequency irradiation decouples spin interactions of the observed nuclei with other types of nuclei, primarily 1H. Homonuclear decoupling by specially designed radio-frequency pulse sequences or fast MAS decouples spin interactions of nuclei that are the same as those being detected. =Recoupling= Although the broadened lines are often not desired, dipolar couplings between atoms in the crystal lattice can also provide very useful information. Dipolar coupling are distance dependent, and so they may be used to calculate interatomic distances in isotopically labeled molecules. Because most dipolar interactions are averaged to zero by sample spinning, recoupling experiments with rotation-synchronized radio- frequency irradiation are needed to re-introduce desired dipolar couplings so they can be measured. A classical example of recoupling is the Rotational Echo DOuble Resonance (REDOR) experiment which also can be the basis of an NMR crystallographic study. =Protons in solid-state NMR= In contrast to traditional approaches particular in protein NMR, in which the broad lines associated with protons effectively relegate this nucleus to mixing of magnetization, recent developments of hardware (very fast MAS) and reduction of dipolar interactions by deuteration have made protons as versatile as they are in solution NMR. This includes spectral dispersion in multi-dimensional experiments as well as structurally valuable restraints and parameters important for studying the materials' dynamics. = Relaxation and spin diffusion = Studies of solids by NMR relaxation experiments are affected by the following general observations. The experimental decay of longitudinal magnetization follows the exponential law if the spin-diffusion mechanism is completely dominant; then a single relaxation time characterizes all of the nuclei, even those that are not chemically or structurally equivalent. The spin-diffusion mechanism is typical of systems with nuclei experiencing strong dipolar interactions (protons, fluorine or phosphorus nuclei at relatively small concentrations of paramagnetic centers) under relatively slow MAS. For other nuclei with weak dipolar coupling at a high concentration of paramagnetic centers, relaxation can be non-exponential following a stretched exponential function, exp(–(τ/T1)β) or exp(–(τ/T2)β). For paramagnetic solids, the β value of 0.5 corresponds to relaxation via direct electron–nucleus dipolar interactions without spin diffusion, while intermediate values between 0.5 and 1.0 can be attributed to a diffusion-limited mechanism. ApplicationsBiology= Membrane proteins and amyloid fibrils, the latter related to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are two examples of applications where solid-state NMR spectroscopy complements solution-state NMR spectroscopy and beam diffraction methods (e.g. X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy). Solid-state NMR structure elucidation of proteins has traditionally been based on secondary chemical shifts and spatial contacts between heteronuclei. Currently, paramagnetic contact shifts and specific proton-proton distances are also used for higher resolution and longer-range distance restraints. =Chemistry and materials science= Solid- state NMR spectroscopy serves as an analysis tool in organic and inorganic chemistry, where is used as a valuable tool to characterize chemical composition, supramolecular structure, local motions, kinetics, and thermodynamics, with the special ability to assign the observed behavior to specific sites in a molecule. Objects of ssNMR studies in materials science are inorganic/organic aggregates in crystalline and amorphous states, composite materials, heterogeneous systems including liquid or gas components, suspensions, and molecular aggregates with dimensions on the nanoscale. In many cases, NMR is the uniquely applicable method for measurement of porosity, particularly for porous systems containing partially filled pores or for dual- phase systems. ssNMR is one of the most effective technique for molecular- level investigation of interfaces. = Art conservation = NMR can also be applied to art conservation. Different salts and moisture levels can be detected through the use of solid state NMR. However, sampling sizes retrieved from works of art in order to run through these large conducting magnets typically exceed levels deemed acceptable. Unilateral NMR techniques use portable magnets that are applied to the object of interest, bypassing the need for sampling. As such, unilateral NMR techniques prove to be useful in the art conservation world.

Written circa 1564 and first printed in 1571, the play chronicles the Greek friendship story of Damon and Pythias. It was originally performed by the Children of the Chapell for Queen Elizabeth, possibly during the Christmas season between 1564 and 1565. On September 10, 1996, an all-female cast gave a single performance at the Globe Theatre in London. Dramatis Personae Damon and Pythias * Damon, a traveling gentleman from Greece, and is close friends with Pythias. * Pythias, a traveling gentleman from Greece, and is close friends with Damon. * Stephano, the servant of both Damon and Pythias. * King Dionysius, the ruler of Syracuse. * Eubulus, counselor to King Dionysius. * Aristippus, a courtier in King Dionysius's court. * Carisophus, a parasite in King Dionysius's court. * Will, the servant of Aristippus. * Jack, the servant of Carisophus. * Groano, the hangman of Syracuse. * Grim, a collier who sells his coal to King Dionysius's court. Synopsis The play begins with the philosopher Aristippus musing on his newfound position as a courtier in King Dionyusius's court in Syracuse. Carisophus enters, looking to join with Aristippus in friendship. Aristippus pretends to agree, though he knows that Carisophus is dissembling and the bond is false. thumb320x320pxScene from 1914 film adaptation of Damon and Pythias Damon, Pythias and Stephano then arrive in Syracuse as part of their travels. The two have been traveling from Greece, and their arrival does not go unnoticed. Carisophus plots to use them in order to advance his own position in court. Damon and Pythias learn about the paranoia and tyranny of King Dionysius and his willingness to kill his subjects. Their servant Stephano begs them to leave before anything terrible can befall them, but the two decide to stay in Syracuse. Carisophus soon meets Damon on the street and has him arrested on suspicion of spying. Against the advice of his trusty counselor Eubulus, King Dionysius condemns Damon to die. Pythias protests his friend's innocence and declares their bond of true friendship. Dionysius agrees that he will keep Pythias prisoner for the next two months while Damon settles his affairs in Greece. If Damon returns before the two months are up, then Pythias will be cleared of suspicion. If he does not return, then Pythias will be executed in his stead. The two months pass with no sign of Damon, and preparations are made for Pythias's execution. Meanwhile, Carisophus meets with Aristippus in order to ask his friend to defend him should Damon return. Aristippus refuses and breaks their bond of friendship, saying that it is not like the true friendship between honest men like Damon and Pythias and that he will not protect Carisophus. The scene shifts back to the gallows, where Pythias and Groano await the king's final judgement. Pythias still trusts that Damon will return, but does not fear death, telling Groano the hangman \\"O thou minister of justice, do thine office by and by, / Let not thy hand tremble, for I tremble not to die.\\" Dionysius orders him to die, but Damon rushes in to stop the execution. Dionysius's heart is so moved by their display of perfect friendship that he stays Pythias's execution. The king goes so far as to ask to become a third friend to them, and Damon and Pythias agree. Dionysius joins with them in amity and resolves to cease acting as a tyrant and listening to flatterers. The play ends with Eubulus throwing Carisophus from the court and delivering a speech on the virtues of true friendship. Eubulus notes that true friendship is a \\"true defence for kings...a shield to defend the enemy's cruel hand\\" and closes the play by wishing that God grant Queen Elizabeth such friends.  Themes  Male Friendship = The notion of male friendship at work in Damon and Pythias harkens back to an idea elaborated by Pythagoras and later Cicero called amicitia perfecta, or ideal and perfect friendship between two men. This notion is seen as the pinnacle of human affection, and occurred between two men of similar social stature who love each other for the sake of that virtue. It is described as altruistic, spiritual and self-sufficient with little mention of marriage or wives but a focus on two men becoming \\"second selves.\\" Cicero writes that the perfect male friendship is \\"above all other things in human life.\\" References from other works * In William Shakespeare's Hamlet, in Act III scene 2, after the play-within-the-play, Hamlet calls Horatio, 'Damon', which is believed to be a reference to this play.Third edition of Hamlet by Ann Thompson and Neil Taylor, first published in 2006 by the Arden Shakespeare; footnote, p. 318 Footnotes References  # # Edwards, Richard.

In medieval cuisine, sops were very common; they were served with broth, soup or wine, salt water and then picked apart into smaller pieces to soak in the liquid. At elaborate feasts, bread was often pre-cut into finger-sized pieces rather than broken off by the diners themselves. The bread or croutons traditionally served with French onion soup, which took its current form in the 18th century, can be considered modern-day sops. The word soup is a cognate of sop, both stemming ultimately from the same Germanic source. The word is mentioned prominently in the Bible, King James Version (emphasis added): In 19th century Australia, sop referred to a dish consisting of stale damper, soaked in cold tea and served with a dollop of jam on top for taste. This was mainly used in prisons and poor-houses, as well as institutions such as asylums. In Portuguese, the word sopa, among other meanings, can generally refer to soup or, particularly in Alentejo, to a piece of dry or even stale bread that is part of the traditional fish broth. The sopa is soaked in the broth and eaten. Expressions The expression milksop describes a person as weak and indecisive. Its connotation is similar to that of \\"milquetoast\\". The term supper derives from sop, and the expression toast of the town derives from the practices of dipping spiced toasted bread into liquid, and of honoring a dinner guest by referring to him or her by that term, which implies he or she adds spice to the dinner party.

Flato (also Charles Floto) (May 27, 1908 – January 1, 1984) was an American writer, American Communist Party member and a Soviet agent. Flato was employed by the United States government and spied for the Soviet intelligence during World War II. Flato suffered from polio as a child which left him with a hunchback and caused him to walk with a cane. He married Lucy Burman, also a Communist Party member. From 1937 to 1941, Flato worked as an investigator and report writer for the Civil Liberties Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor chaired by Senator Robert M. La Follette, Jr., and the Foreign Economic Administration. He also served under Nelson Rockefeller in the Blockade and Supply Branch of the Latin American division of the Board of Economic Warfare during World War II. He resigned from the government and moved to San Francisco about mid-July 1945. He is mentioned in Venona project transcript #588 of April 29, 1944.Elizabeth Bentley reports on new KGB recruits from American Communist Party , Venona 588 New York to Moscow, April 29, 1944. Flato's complicity in espionage was corroborated by information exhumed from the NKVD archives in the 1990s. He was also a member of the \\"Sound\\" and \\"Myrna\\" groups. His codename in the Gorsky memo is \\"Bob\\". In another Venona transcript, he is believed to be codename \\"Char\\". Sometime in the 1950s, he and his wife divorced. By 1957, Flato had a cottage designed and built by the architect Serge Chermayeff. He lived alone in this cottage near a beach on Cape Cod and worked as a freelance writer throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1957, he was the editor of the Complete Home Improvement Handbook. He is known to have used at least one ghost writer in the form of a friend for an article printed in The Saturday Evening Post in the early 1960s. The Golden Book of the Civil War was a children's book written by Flato and published in 1961. After the People's Republic of China resumed diplomatic relations with the United States, Flato wrote a six-part report on health care in China. The Chinese Medical Association invited him to travel through the country as their guest. Flato was one of the co-founders of the Medical Pharmaceutical Information Bureau, and wrote and edited for the publication Hospital Practice. He was known to have also written scripts for medical documentaries. Suze Rotolo kept close ties with Flato visiting him at his home on Cape Cod. He gave Suze his car before he died of kidney failure in Hyannis, Massachusetts, on January 1, 1984.The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, Suze Rotolo article, Michael Gray, Continuum International Publishing Group Only after the fall of the Soviet Union when the files of the KGB became open to researchers was it discovered that he was spying for the Soviets in the 1940s.

As one of the smallest local newspapers, in terms of circulation, it was based in Rockville from its first print in 1855 until its closure in 2020.  History  The Montgomery County Sentinel was first published as a weekly newspaper on August 11, 1855 by Matthew Fields in Rockville, Maryland. The early focus of the paper was on advertising and politics, with relatively little space devoted to local news. News articles were usually brief and to the point without elaboration. On two occasions, once before and once during the Civil War, the paper suffered brief interruptions while Union military forces detained Matthew Fields, a Southern sympathizer. Throughout the war, the Sentinel wrote on the issue of slavery and when Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Fields published the document's text in full on September 26, 1862. In addition to discussing the various political issues, war reports informed readers on the progress of the war. After rioting killed Union soldiers in Baltimore, the institution of martial law in Maryland allowed the Union Army to imprison Confederate sympathizers for disloyalty. On October 6, 1862, Union soldiers arrested Matthew Fields on the suspicion of 'southern sympathies.' Court documents indicate Fields was to be released as soon as he was willing to take an oath not to publish material favoring the South. He was released on November 25, 1862, during Lincoln's Thanksgiving Amnesty. Fields died in 1871 and his wife, Rebecca, took over publication, often handling production entirely on her own until 1910 when Matthew Fields' son Henry Clay Fields became the editor. Rebecca Fields maintained a limited role until her death in 1930 at age 100. The Fields family maintained ownership of the Sentinel until 1932 before selling it to Paul Griffith Stromberg. Stromberg expanded the newspaper, hired numerous reporters and a newsboy to handle deliveries. His ownership period focused a great deal on roads as roads were essential to moving products from the mills. Stromberg’s ownership also included the period through World War II and the need to rally support for the war, including coverage of the death of his son as well as the use of German prisoners of war to help on farms in Gaithersburg, Maryland. In its centennial year, the Stromberg family sold the Sentinel to Louis Linebach and Cy Campbell. During their ownership, Linebach and Campbell had significant disagreements, with Campbell eventually selling his stake in the publication. One of the key events during their ownership period was the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. In 1962, Leonard and Bernard Kapiloff purchased the newspaper from Linebach. During the 1960s, the Sentinel’s reporting on \\"The Giles Case,\\" often referred to as the \\"'To Kill a Mockingbird' case of Montgomery County,\\" led to freeing African Americans charged and wrongly convicted of rape. After failing a two-week trial hiring at The Washington Post in 1970, Bob Woodward spent a year at the Sentinel as a reporter. The Post rehired Woodward and within 12 months he partnered with Carl Bernstein to investigate the Watergate break-in. In June 2015, the Sentinel removed over 80 editorial cartoons it had plagiarized from a variety of other artists. On January 30, 2020, the Sentinel ceased publication.

History The project was first reported in 1995 and announced by Russian official sources in 2000, but no concrete data had been released. It was due to be introduced in 2009, but was repeatedly delayed. The Russian government terminated its involvement in the project in May 2010 and withdrew all funding. Most information about this tank was speculative. The design was presumably a significant departure from the Soviet-era tanks currently in service. In particular, it was expected to have a new hydropneumatic suspension with adaptive features, and the entire crew was apparently going to be placed in a sealed compartment inside the hull, isolated from other tank components. T-95 was a name given to the tank by media; it was not an official name. According to published sources, development of a new tank called \\"Object 195\\" began at the Uralvagonzavod design bureau in the early 1990s. The prototype tank was announced by the Russian Minister of Defense Igor Sergeyev in 2000. On July 10, 2008 the Russian government announced that the Russian armed forces would start receiving new-generation tanks superior to the T-90 main battle tank after 2010. \\"The T-90 MBT will be the backbone of the armored units until 2025. T-72's and T-80's will not be modernized and will be eventually replaced by new-generation tanks, which will start entering service after 2010\\", a news conference with Sergei Mayev, head of the Federal Service for Defence Contracts. On the first day of Russian Defence Expo 2010 in Nizhny Tagil, The Director of the Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation of the Russian Federation, Konstantin Biryulin, announced to the press that the Russian state monopoly Federal Service for Defense Contracts was unveiling the prototype of new battle tank called \\"Object 195\\" (T-95) in a private showing to selected VIP guests, though the tank has yet to be seen by journalists or confirmed publicly by any of the participants. However, in May 2010, deputy defense minister and chief of armaments Vladimir Popovkin announced that a number of programs for development of new armor and artillery weapons would be canceled. The main victim is the Object 195 program. Popovkin said the military will focus on modernization of the T-90 instead. The reason given for this was the fact that the T-95 was already obsolete, as it had been in development for almost two decades, but some sources speculated it had more to do with the recent reduction in Russia's military budget, requiring substantial cuts across the board. Popovkin confirmed this decision in a June 2010 Interview, stating that Russia would no longer fund and was not going to buy the T-95, but that Uralvagonzavod might continue to work on the tank without government support. In early July 2010, as reported by \\"Ural Information Bureau\\" : the Minister of Industry and Science, Sverdlovsk region, Alexander Petrov said that Uralvagonzavod would soon finalize a T-95 prototype, entirely independently. However without state funding or export permits, the company would be unable to proceed to production.

Cabela's was founded by Richard N. Cabela in 1961. Cabela's mail- order catalogs are shipped to 50 states and 120 countries. More than 120 million catalogs were mailed in its first year as a public company. It also has \\"Trophy Properties LLC\\" (a real estate market), the \\"Gun Library\\" (for buying and selling new, used, and collectible firearms). Water tower at Buda, Texas next to Cabela's store History The company that would become a sporting goods reseller and chain was started in 1961. Richard (Dick) N. Cabela purchased $45 worth of fishing flies at a furniture expo in Chicago which he then advertised for sale in a local newspaper advertisement. When his first effort produced only one response, he placed an ad in a national magazine, Sports Afield, which was more successful. Included with each order was a catalog of other products for sale by Cabela. As the business grew, Cabela and his wife Mary moved their operation to Sidney, Nebraska in 1963. Dick's brother Jim also joined the business. From those beginnings, the company has since grown to a publicly traded corporation with over $3 billion in annual sales. On February 17, 2014, founder Dick Cabela died at his home in Sidney, Nebraska, at the age of 77. About half of Cabela's sales come from hunting-related merchandise with about a third derived from the sale of firearms, ammunition and accessories in 2012. Additionally, in 2012 30% of revenue came from direct sales (through catalog and online orders), and 59% from physical retail stores. The remaining 11% of revenue came from its financial subsidiary and credit card business. In 1996, Gander Mountain, prior to declaring bankruptcy, sold its mail order business to Cabela's with a non- compete clause. In 2007, Cabelas brought suit against them to prevent their re-entry into the mail-order business. Gander Mountain won the lawsuit and began selling online as well. In February 2013, Cabela's sued Gander Mountain for patent infringement over a fold-up cot that Gander was selling. In December 2013, Gander sued Cabela's for cybersquatting. In March 2014, Cabela's sold their recreational real estate division, Cabela's Trophy Properties, to Sports Afield. In December 2015, Cabela's sold their Outdoor Adventures & T.A.G.S. divisions to Worldwide Trophy Adventures. On October 3, 2016, Bass Pro Shops announced an agreement to acquire Cabela's for $5.5 billion.  Retail stores  Cabelas Store in Wheeling, West Virginia.

In 2010, the Canadian Head Office and Distribution Centre moved across the city, leaving the original location as only a retail store. The company had intended to be a part of the Lac-Mirabel project near Montreal, which was to include of retail space, and was planned to open in 2008.Cabela's Montreal store Press Release Cabelas.com But instead, rival chain Bass Pro Shops became one of the mall anchors. In 2011 Cabela's opened a store in Edmonton, Alberta and a store opened in Saskatoon in 2012 another store in Calgary, Alberta opened in 2015. Gun Library In early 2012, Cabela's unveiled a new retail initiative called Cabela's Outpost Stores. The first outpost store opened in Union Gap in the fall of 2012. Cabela's stores have been a target of gun thieves over the years. One store alone in South Carolina lost around 100 guns within a one-year range.  Acquisition by Bass Pro Shops  On July 5, 2017, the Federal Trade Commission approved the acquisition of Cabela's by Bass Pro Shops. The acquisition was complete on September 25, 2017. The acquisition resulted in 2,000 jobs lost in Cabela's headquarters of Sidney, Nebraska. Banking and finance Founded on March 23, 2001 (FDIC Certificate #57079), Cabela's financial subsidiary was named World's Foremost Bank (WFB, a play on Cabela's marketing moniker, World's Foremost Outfitter). The bank's primary activity was as a credit card issuer for the Cabela's Club Visa card, a branded rewards card. With 11% of total sales attributed to the subsidiary, in 2013 it ranked as the 13th largest issuer of credit cards in the US. Around a third of Cabela's customers have this Visa card. The subsidiary consisted of a single-branch bank with a deposit market share in the state of Nebraska of just under 1.2 percent, with $505 million in deposits as of 2011. At the end of 2012, the bank claimed to have $3,731,567,000 in assets. Sean Baker was appointed president of World's Foremost Bank and chief executive officer on January 1, 2013. Baker replaced Joseph M. Friebe, whose planned retirement was announced in June 2012. =2011 FDIC settlement= In its annual report, Cabela's announced that it has reached a settlement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regarding its credit card policies and practices. It was ordered to repay wronged cardholders $10 million plus a $250,000 penalty. The subsidiary did not admit to or deny the FDIC's finding, but agreed to do the following: > * Refrain from the Bank's prior practice of contacting a cardholder at the > cardholder's place of employment for purposes of collecting a debt after a > verbal or written request is made by either the cardholder or the > cardholder's employer to cease such contact because the cardholder's > employer prohibits such communications. * Refrain from the Bank's prior > practice of assessing a penalty interest rate on balances that existed prior > to the event that caused the penalty interest rate to be imposed. * Refrain > from the Bank's prior practice of assessing late fees when periodic payments > are due on Sundays or holidays and the payment is posted the following > business day. * Refrain from the Bank's prior practice of assessing a second > over-the-credit-limit fee (OL fee) on the first day of a billing cycle when > a cardholder exceeded his or her credit limit during the prior billing > cycle, was assessed an over limit fee during the prior billing cycle and was > over limit at the end of that billing cycle and through the beginning of the > next billing cycle. * Refrain from the Bank's prior practice of imposing an > over limit fee if such fee is imposed as a result of applying a cardholder's > reduced credit limit to balances that preceded the date of a credit line > decrease, or imposing an over limit fee if such fee is imposed solely as a > result of a credit line decrease at the end of the billing cycle without > adequate notice. * Refrain from the Bank's prior practice of establishing a > minimum periodic payment amount that is insufficient to avoid recurring OL > fees. * Refrain from the Bank's prior practice of implementing an increase > in penalty rates without providing adequate notice to cardholders, as > required by 12 C.F.R. § 226.9. Additionally, the FDIC required WFB to make certain changes in their management policy to increase oversight of their credit card business and to prevent further unfair practices. =2011 Royal Bank of Canada loan= The Bank entered into a $411.7 million commitment with the Royal Bank of Canada under a series of variable funding notes issued by Cabela's Credit Card Master Note Trust. The loan is for three years and accrues interest at a variable rate of commercial paper plus a spread. =2017 Sale to Synovus & Capital One= As part of the merger with Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's sold the World's Foremost Bank aspect of their business, including over $1 billion in assets, to Synovus who then proceeded to immediately sell Cabela's CLUB credit card program to Capital One.

There are currently seven GameWorks venues throughout the U.S, with the re- opening of the chains' flagship store in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Las Vegas store is the first store in the chain with a dedicated esports arena, a devoted space for multi-player online computer gaming. Esports has now become an integral part of all new and developing locations in the chain.  History  The chain began as a joint venture between Sega, Universal Studios, and DreamWorks. It opened its first location in Seattle in March 1997. Steven Spielberg provided creative input before DreamWorks sold its portion in 2001. The chain itself filed its first bankruptcy in 2004. Six years later the company filed its second bankruptcy. On November 3, 2005, Sega Sammy Holdings, which was formed by the merger of Sega and Sammy, bought all of the controlling interests of GameWorks. As a result of the second bankruptcy filing in 2010, Sega Entertainment USA, the parent company at that time, suddenly closed down seven GameWorks venues on March 29, 2010, in an attempt to focus the chain's mission on profitability and future growth. Two locations that closed up, one in Circle Centre at Indianapolis, Indiana, and another location in Irvine Spectrum Center at Irvine, California, originally opened up as Sega City. In 2011, GameWorks was sold to an investment group named HNR Capital. In October 2011, GameWorks acquired the assets of several Jillian's Billiards Clubs in California, Washington, and Virginia. In May 2017, Oomba agreed to acquire GameWorks. In May 2018, ExWorks Capital took ownership of its parent company, and as a result, GameWorks is now owned by ExWorks Capital.

History Before Týr, Heri Joensen and Gunnar H. Thomsen formed their first band, Cruiser, at the age of seventeen. Streymoy also played with them for a short while. They later changed their name to Wolfgang. Although neither band released any albums, Wolfgang, who are still active, recorded an undisclosed number of songs that, according to Joensen, are \\"pretty much ready to release.\\"Pre-Týr info is discussed in this Deadtide Interview Týr formed in Copenhagen in 1998.Karl Spracklen, \\"‘To Holmgard … and Beyond’: Folk metal fantasies and hegemonic white masculinities\\", Metal Music Studies, 1.3 (September 2015), 359-77 (p. 368); . Heri Joensen met his old bandmate, Kári Streymoy, at a party in January in Copenhagen. Joensen suggested to Streymoy that they should meet up and jam. Streymoy initially declined, but later took him up on his offer. They were soon joined by another former bandmate, bassist Gunnar H. Thomsen, expanding the duo into a trio. In 2001, guitarist Terji Skibenæs joined the band. They signed a worldwide deal with Austria's Napalm Records in early 2006, while signed to the Faroese record label Tutl. In September 2012, they signed a three-album deal with Metal Blade Records. They began making music which was heavily inspired by Norse mythology, kvæði (Faroese traditional music), and heavy metal music in general. According to the band's frontman Heri Joensen: Accordingly, scholarship has found that the band's lyrics and imagery promote pan-Nordic ideologies, and draw on well established, transnational genre conventions from metal music; but has also suggested that the band's insistence on their Faroese identity, which has been fetishised by international audiences, could 'be regarded as a form of self- exoticisation'.Joshua Green, 'From the Faroes to the World Stage', in The Oxford Handbook of Popular Music in the Nordic Countries, ed. by Fabian Holt, Antti-Ville Kärjä (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017), pp. 111-29 (p. 123-24); . The band's handling of traditional songs is characterised by fidelity to traditional melodies, but more complex and innovative handling of associated chord progressions and harmonies.Mark David Deeks, 'National Identity in Northern and Eastern European Heavy Metal' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of Leeds, 2016), pp. 163-66. The band has been accused of promoting Nazi ideologies through their use of runes and other imagery appropriated by Nazis. The band responded to these accusations with the song \\"Shadow of the Swastika\\" on the album Lay of Thrym (2011), which in the assessment of Karl Spracklen, 'attacks the far-right for appropriating...heathen symbols and images associated with pre-Christian northern Europe'. Even so, scholars have, in the words of Catherine Hoad and Samuel Whiting, suggested that 'through imagining the Viking as an ancestral, genetic category, the \\"common past\\" of the Nordic people is constructed as a self-identity apart from other people' in the work of Týr.Catherine Hoad, Samuel Whiting, 'True Kvlt?

Likewise, Spracklen finds that 'the themes in Týr's songs celebrate pagan identity, Viking identity and the hegemonic masculinity of the Viking warrior combined with the modern-day heavy metal anthem of being an individual'.Karl Spracklen, \\"‘To Holmgard … and Beyond’: Folk metal fantasies and hegemonic white masculinities\\", Metal Music Studies, 1.3 (September 2015), 359-77 (pp. 368-69); . Tours Týr performing live in Bilston, Wolverhampton in October 2013They performed at the Ragnarök Festival in 2007 and 2009. Týr was a part of the Paganfest tour in Europe and the U.S. in 2008, with Ensiferum headlining. Other bands on the tour included Eluveitie, Turisas in the United States, and Moonsorrow and Korpiklaani joined them on the European part of the tour. In 2009, the band also took part in the \\"Black Sails over Europe\\" tour, supporting Alestorm, who were promoting their album Black Sails at Midnight. Later, in 2010, the band would support Amon Amarth and Holy Grail on Amon Amarth's North American tour for select dates. In January 2011 and 2013, Týr played on the \\"70,000 Tons of Metal\\" cruise ship event with 40 other bands. In 2012, the band supported Korpiklaani on their \\"Manala\\" tour in the U.S. and Canada along with Metsatöll and Moonsorrow. During April 2013, Týr joined Ensiferum, Heidevolk, and others for the North American leg of the Paganfest tour. They took part in a European tour between 6 September – 14 October 2013 with Finnish folk metal band Finntroll and Icelandic band Skálmöld. The tour is called \\"Blodsvept over Europe\\". Band members Terji Skibenæs at Metalmania 2007 Singer Pól Arni Holm and guitarist Jón Joensen (Heri Joensen's brother) were part of the band while they recorded How Far to Asgaard but left soon after its release.

It was this line up which recorded Eric the Red. Skibenæs left the band for a while after the release of Eric the Red. The band played as a trio for some time. In the summer of 2004 they were joined by Icelandic guitarist Ottó P. Arnarson for a very brief time. When Arnarson left, Skibenæs came back. Kári Streymoy had a back injury in January 2008, which made him unable to tour until October the same year. Amon Djurhuus, a Faeroese drummer and student of Kári Streymoy, played the drums on the European part of the Paganfest, Merlin Sutter from Eluveitie filled for him on the US part and Daniel Ryan from Gigan on the Canadian part. After that for the festival tour in Europe Amon Djurhuus filled for Kári again. In October 2008 Kári Streymoy was ready to go again for the Ragnarök's Aaskereia Festival Tour. Týr announced on 12 May 2013 via their official website as well as their Facebook, Twitter and Myspace pages that they had parted ways with long-time drummer Kári Streymoy, owing to the back injury he had received in 2008 which had affected his drumming. On May 15, 2013, they announced that renowned metal drummer George Kollias will record drums for their seventh album Valkyrja. Amon Djurhuus enters temporarily in the band, once again, for the tour with Finntroll between September and October 2013. In August 2018, after 17 years with the band Terji Skibenæs announced his departure, stating \\"There's no drama or anything going on between me and the others. It's just me not having any joy to play the music in the style of TÝR anymore. I want to thank Heri Joensen and Gunnar Thomsen for the all the time we had and I wish TÝR all the best in the future.\\" The opening left by Skibenæs' exit was filled by former Nevermore and Satyricon guitarist Attila Vörös. =Side projects= Current Týr lead singer, Heri Joensen, is working on a side project with the band Heljareyga. They released their self-titled debut album in 2010. All lyrics on the album are in Faroese. It was released first as a download on February 12, 2010 at digital retailers, but CD copies came later available at Tutl Records. Joensen also has the side project 'Surma' with his Czech girlfriend Viktorie Surmová. Their first album, Reveal the Light Within, is scheduled to be released on 1 November, 2020.

One of the first German colonists in Pennsylvania, he became a leader of that community and prospered in land transactions. He “arrived in Philadelphia in 1717 with nearly no money; at the time of his death in 1752, his wealth outstripped that of the contemporary elite more than threefold...an immigrant’s path to achieving the American Dream.\\"Penn State University Press, Immigrant and Entrepreneur, The Atlantic World of Caspar Wistar, 1650–1750 Rosalind Beiler, accessed August 31, 2014. He was the father of Richard Wistar, Sr. (1727-1781), glassmaker and landowner in Pennsylvania and the grandfather of Caspar Wistar (1761-1818), the physician and anatomist after whom the genus Wisteria is named. Another child, Rebecca Wistar, married Samuel Morris. Biography Caspar Wistar, the son of forester Hans Caspar Wüster, spent his first 21 years in Waldhilsbach, a village in the Palatinate near Heidelberg under the reign of prince Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine (1658-1716). According to family tradition, he was born in the village's forester’s house.Beiler, page 27-49, [Footnote: 18 Robert C. Moon, The Morris Family of Philadelphia: Descendants of Anthony Morris, vol. 1 (Philadelphia, 1898), 356-7.] He grew up during the tumultuous Nine Years' War (1688-1697) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1702-1713) which caused hardships and instability for the people of the Palatinate due to invasions by the French and British. Wistar served as a foresters' apprentice, but government reforms (particularly pay cuts for foresters) limited his professional opportunities, so he decided to emigrate to the United States.Kummer, Insa. \\"Caspar Wistar.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German- American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 1, edited by Marianne S. Wokeck. German Historical Institute. Last modified September 25, 2014. He left the Palatinate in 1717, forgoing his father’s hereditary title and position to seek out a new life across the Atlantic Ocean. \\"On Dec. 7, 1738, a German immigrant named Caspar Wistar recruited four craftsmen from his homeland to help him launch his empire of glass in to the sandy forests of Salem County .\\" He arrived in Pennsylvania in 1717 (according to his memoir, with only nine pennies to his name). Upon his arrival, he was registered under the surname \\"Wistar\\". He worked at various manual trades, including soapmaking and the manufacture of brass buttons. He became a British subject in 1724 and joined the Religious Society of Friends (the Quakers) in 1726. He married Catherine Jansen in 1727; they had seven children. With the support of Quaker merchants and political leaders, he set up a glass factory and began buying land and selling it to new immigrants from Germany. His land deals made him one of the richest men in Pennsylvania. His brother, John (born Johannes Wüster) (1708–1789) emigrated to Philadelphia in 1727. His brother Johannes WÜSTER) (John WISTER (1708–1789)) settled in the Germantown district, and was registered under a variant of the surname, “Wister.” To this day there exists two spellings of the family name.Sarah Wister and Albert Cook Myers, Sally Wister's journal: a true narrative; being a Quaker maiden's account of her experiences with officers of the Continental Army, 1777-1778; Ferris & Leach, 1902, p. 10. While Caspar anglicized his name to \\"Wistar\\", John spelled his \\"Wister\\". The two each founded prominent Philadelphia-area families, and the difference in spelling persisted.

He was born in Lee City, Wolfe County, Kentucky as the fourth of eleven children and educated through the sixth grade. He worked as a carpenter and stonemason and was married twice, fathering eighteen children in all. From his youth, woodcarving was always a hobby of his. Although Tolson began working in the tradition of the Appalachian woodcarvers before him, after suffering a stroke in 1957, he became a full-time woodcarver and artist, and his subject matter grew increasingly idiosyncratic. Tolson first came to national attention through the Grassroots Craftsmen, an initiative of Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty that helped Appalachian craftspeople to sell their works. Ralph Rinzler of the Smithsonian Institution was impressed by Tolson's figures, and included them in the 1971 Festival of American Folklife. University of Kentucky professor Michael Hall also became Tolson's primary dealer at this time, and his work was included in the 1973 Whitney Biennial. Tolson is best known for his \\"Fall of Man\\" cycle, a series of carvings portraying the story of Adam and Eve. He died in Campton, Kentucky in 1984. The Edgar Tolson Folk Art Library at Morehead State University is named after him.

His properties included the towns of Frontignan and Mireval. He was the only son of William of Aumelas and of Tiburge, daughter of Raimbaut, count of Orange. After the early death of Raimbaut's father, his guardians were his uncle William VII of Montpellier and his elder sister Tibors. He was a major troubadour, having contributed to the creation of trobar ric, or articulate style, in troubadour poetry. About forty of his works survive, displaying a gusto for rare rhymes and intricate poetic form. His death in 1173 is mourned in a planh (lament) by Giraut de Bornelh, and also in the only surviving poem of the trobairitz Azalais de Porcairagues, who was the lover of Raimbaut's cousin Gui Guerrejat. It seems possible that Azalais's poem was composed in an earlier form while Raimbaut was still alive, because in his poem A mon vers dirai chanso he appears to contribute to the poetical debate begun by Guilhem de Saint-Leidier and taken up by Azalais as to whether a lady is dishonoured by taking a lover who is richer than herself. Aimo Sakari argues that Azalais is the mysterious joglar (\\"jongleur\\") addressed in several poems by Raimbaut. Bibliography *Pattison, Walter T.

He was also a photographer, plein aire painter, art educator and muralist.  Early life and education  On March 25, 1876, he was born in Chicago, Illinois to a wealthy family. He showed early artistic talent and by age 11 he was taking art classes at Art Institute of Chicago. His art education included training at the Académie Julian (1899). In addition he studied in the atelier of William Merritt Chase and Chase School of Art and Académie Carmen with James MacNeill Whistler.

A group of murals completed in 1929 can still be seen at the former 1st Trust & Savings Bank at 587 East Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California. The murals consist of four panels standing approximately ten feet in height, each depicting a major southern California industry: oil drilling, citrus farming, the movies, and shipping.  Personal life  In 1898, he traveled to France and, in 1902, returned to the United States. In 1920, he married Atta Medora McMullin (1881–1962).

Photo: Arthur Rothstein Duval Street () is a downtown commercial zoned street in Key West, Florida, running north and south from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, just over 1.25 miles in length. It is named for William Pope Duval, the first territorial governor of Florida. Duval Street was designated a “Great Street” in 2012 by the American Planning Association. The beautiful Bahamian and Spanish influenced Victorian Mansions of Duval Street have been well preserved through local preservation efforts starting in the 1960s. On the Atlantic Ocean end of Duval Street there is a mix of early Key West Victorian mansions and bungalows dotting the neighborhood. Art galleries, boutiques, inns and Bodega’s line the wide sidewalks. Although this end of Duval is more residential and less filled with tourists, the sidewalks still bustle with activity. One block west of the southern terminus of Duval Street is the buoy marker for the southernmost point in the United States; it is close to the Southernmost House, a Victorian mansion built in 1896. A favorite of both Harry S. Truman and author Ernest Hemingway, the building was restored to its formal beauty and opulence with a $3 million renovation in 1996. Duval Street well represents the cultural influence of Key West’s proximity and cultural ties to Cuba. Many Cubans immigrated to the area beginning in the late 1860s. At one time, the many cigar stores on Duval gave the city the moniker “Cigar City USA.” There are many pleasant outdoor cafes to enjoy another Cubano influenced product, “Cuban Coffee”, which is espresso made from roasted Cuban Coffee beans with a heavy dose of sugar. At the north end, tourists from the cruise ships that dock at the Margaritaville Resort & Marina, Mole pier or Mallory Square are often seen traversing Duval Street's many shops [1] in the afternoon looking for souvenir trinkets and cheap T-shirts. The streets are congested with Pedi cabs, trollies, bikes, mopeds, cars, and the Conch Train all adding to the touristy feel of this heavily visited end of Duval. Near the northern end of the street is Mallory Square. Historic Mallory Square is the center of Key West’s waterfront. The City of Key West and Duval Street share their beginning along this deep harbor waterfront. On certain nights, the gulf shores of Duval Street often vibrate with a carnival like atmosphere that lasts until dawn and beyond. In fact, the ritual has a name known to tourists and residents as the “Duval Pub Crawl.” Duval is the location of many famous restaurants and bars, including Sloppy Joe's, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, which is the original, Fogarty's Restaurant, Bar and Bakery, \\"The Flying Monkeys Bar\\", The Bull and Whistle, Rick's Cafe and Irish Kevin's bar, Bourbon Street Pub and Aqua. Tour outlets book the “Duval Pub Crawl” activity and provide knowledgeable guidance for the tourist wishing to visit and imbibe at the famous drinking establishments, for a fee. A 1967 National Park Service survey of Historic American Buildings designated 18 buildings as historic. A full six blocks were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Further protection for this historically significant street has been created through the City’s, “Historic Architecture Guidelines,” approved in 2000, which sets standards for construction on Duval Street. Neighborhood Duval Street is also a neighborhood within the City of Key West. It is the area on either side of Duval Street, and includes the area to the north of Front Street, containing Wall Street, Mallory Square and the Port of Key West.

The band moved to London early in their career, and although they recorded only a handful of songs before being forced to disband, they are considered highly influential in the then-emerging genre. Creem, in their September 2004 review, wrote, \\"The saga of the Misunderstood is one of the most unbelievable, heartbreaking, and unlikely stories in the entire history of rock.\\" Classic Rocks June 2010 issue stated, \\"The truth is that this band (the Misunderstood) were so far out on their own, so individual and innovative that you can only wonder at the set of circumstances that conspired to prevent them from becoming the iconic name that was surely their destiny.\\"Classic Rock honoring the Misunderstood at No. 18 in their June 2010 list of \\"Cult Heroes\\" History The band began in 1963 as one of many garage bands formed in the US in the wake of the British Invasion. They moved to London in 1966, with the assistance of their manager, John Peel, who would later gain fame as an influential BBC Radio DJ. In the UK, they recruited Englishman Tony Hill on rhythm guitar. Hill and singer Rick Brown formed a songwriting team. Bass player Steve Whiting was also involved in developing material for the band. The band was influenced by and often compared to the Yardbirds, and in 2004 were called \\"the American Yardbirds\\" by Rolling Stone.Rolling Stone, September 2004 Distinctive features of the band's sound included the steel guitar of Glenn Ross Campbell and the innovative style of Whiting, known for his use of slide, fuzz tone and distortion. Fontana Records introduced the band with a four-song live performance in London's Philips Studios. British media response was positive, but at this juncture it was decided that Campbell, Whiting, and Moe should go to Europe to sort out their British visas and work permits, while Brown returned to California for his draft. In London they released their second single, \\"I Can Take You to the Sun\\", before being forced to disband. They had only recorded six tracks in London. In spite of their relatively small output, many musicians consider them to be influential pioneers of the acid style of rock music. Head Heritage in a 2006 review wrote, \\"The Misunderstood's material extended far beyond the reach of the period in which it was conceived. The extraordinarily advanced tracks on side one from 1966 reveal them as one of the earliest and most original probes into psychedelic rock.\\" =John Peel= British DJ John Peel championed the Misunderstood's music throughout his entire career. Shortly before his death, in an interview with Index Magazine, Peel stated, \\"If I had to list the ten greatest performances I've seen in my life, one would be the Misunderstood at Pandora's Box, Hollywood, 1966. My god, they were a great band!\\" =Visual feedback= The Misunderstood are known for having pioneered the live light show. Campbell initially soldered a guitar jack to a car light bulb and plugged this into the extension output behind each amp. This simple idea produced visual music, as the response between the guitars and the lights plugged into the amps was identical. They first showed this feature at the Hi Ho Club in Riverside in early 1966. They also played with lights at the Marquee Club in London in mid 1966. An advanced, multicolored, large scale version of this \\"light show\\" or \\"visual sound\\" system was being planned in London when the band were forced to retire. Another feature of their visuals was getting all three guitars feeding back using different tremolo settings, thereby leaving the stage flashing with musical lights. =Later period= Glenn Ross Campbell went on to Juicy Lucy, while Tony Hill formed High Tide and recorded a solo album titled Inexactness. In 1982, Glenn Ross Campbell and Rick Brown reunited as \\"Influence\\", and in 1983 recorded two self-penned tracks, \\"No Survivors\\" and \\"Queen of Madness\\", for UK's Rough Trade Records. They disbanded in 1985 when Campbell moved to New Zealand and Brown moved to Thailand. Cherry Red Records (UK) released three albums of the Misunderstood's music, viz., Before the Dream Faded (BRED 32) in 1982, The Legendary Goldstar Album (CDM RED 142) in 1997, and a full album of the Misunderstood's later material under the name of The Misunderstood: Broken Road (CDM RED 147) in 1998. In 2004, Ugly Things Records (USA) issued another full album of previously unreleased tracks named The Lost Acetates 1965–1966, that received international media coverage. A motion picture screen play (The Misunderstood: WGA 977444) about the band and Brown's adventures was written by rock historian Mike Stax (editor of Ugly Things) in 2002, and is under revision. A novel: Like, Misunderstood – based on the script was published in October 2007. Musical recognition *In his \\"Peelenium\\" (Greatest Songs of the 20th Century) John Peel lists the band's song, \\"I Can Take You to the Sun\\" for 1966. * \\"I Can Take You to the Sun\\" appears as number 6 in Record Collectors book, \\"100 Greatest Psychedelic Records\\", a list in chronological order. *Mojo April 2009 – \\"I Can See For Miles: A-Z\\" lists the Misunderstood for \\"M\\". *June 11, 2010, Classic Rock named the Misunderstood as No. 18 in their list of \\"Cult Heroes\\".

It provides supplementary game material for campaigns involving characters of good alignment. Within the game, there is also a powerful magical artifact of the same name. Publication history Wizards of the Coast had published the controversial Book of Vile Darkness in 2002, a game supplement that explored evil themes and raised the ire of some with its \\"Mature Content\\" sticker, sexualized imagery and graphic details. The following year, WotC released the Book of Exalted Deeds, also with a \\"Mature Content\\" warning. The book was written by James Wyatt, Darrin Drader and Christopher Perkins, with cover art by Henry Higginbotham, and interior art by Tom Baxa, Steve Belladin, Matt Cavotta, Brent Chumley, Rebecca Guay-Mitchell, Jeremy Jarvis, Doug Kovacs, Ginger Kubic, David Martin, Mark Nelson, Wayne Reynolds, Ron Spencer, Arnie Swekel, and Ben Thompson. Contents The Book of Exalted Deeds was designed to be a counterpoint to the previously published Book of Vile Deeds, and offered new rules for good occurrences, acts, and characters in the game. =Chapter Summary= # The Nature of Good: This defines how good is seen in the Dungeons & Dragons setting, as well as how good-aligned characters of different alignments act in relation to the world around them. # Variant Rules: This simply adds additional rules for a campaign featuring good-aligned characters that allows such characters to become exalted characters. # Exalted Equipment: This talks about the weapons (sometimes special) used by exalted characters. # Feats: This chapter includes several new feats, the vast majority of which are exalted feats, meant specifically for good-aligned characters and usable only by such. # Prestige Classes: This chapter introduces prestige classes appropriate for an exalted campaign. # Magic: This chapter provides spells almost exclusively for good characters, as well as magical items, weapon and armor enhancements, and artifacts appropriate to such a campaign. # Celestial Paragons: This chapter discusses (and provides NPC stat blocks for) celestial paragons, rulers of the Upper planes so overwhelmingly powerful that they are revered as a god would be, even on the Material Plane. It also discusses the Upper Planes to an extent. # Monsters: This chapter contains good-aligned monsters, featuring the Deathless type, as well as templates to create customized monsters. =The Book of Exalted Deeds artifact= Not to be confused with the book, a powerful magical artifact of the same name was first described by Gary Gygax in the original Dungeon Master's Guide for AD&D.; The original item raised the Wisdom ability score of good clerics who spent a week reading it, and also granted them a new level of experience. The artifact has subsequently appeared in every new edition of D&D;, although with varying powers. Reception * While reviewer Alex DeMorris thought that the book had some \\"great new material\\", he noted that the new \\"paragon\\" class of creatures lacked any obvious motive or purpose, saying, \\"Their descriptions come across more as creature statistics than a character portrait. Without goals, it may be hard for a DM to use them as anything other than stage dressing when the player characters start traveling the planes.\\" DeMorris concluded that the book had \\"some rough spots that could have been better developed\\", and that it was \\"a good book, but not a great one.\\" * Reviewer Merric Blackman thought there was good material in the book, particularly about the nature of good, variant rules for good characters, new feats and prestige classes. He was less enthused about new equipment, new magic spells and new monsters. Blackman thought this was a stronger book than Book of Vile Darkness due to the inclusion of more usable material, but he warned that it \\"may not integrate well into your established D&D; cosmology.\\" He also noted the \\"tendency towards powerful abilities that may not be properly balanced by the role-playing restrictions. This is not a book for the novice Dungeon Master!\\" Nevertheless, he concluded that he did like the book, and found it \\"inspiring\\". *The review site Game Monkeys Magazine liked the tangible theme of the book, and found the artwork \\"fair to good with no real stand out pieces.\\" It also found the new feats, prestige classes and spells \\"solid additions to the game.\\" It concluded by giving the book an average rating of 3.5 out of 5, saying \\"All in all, for those who like to play the extremely valiant character, the Book of Exalted Deeds is a solid addition to your primary sourcebook\\", but added \\"That is unfortunately only useful if you're playing the gaming equivalent of Mother Theresa.\\" References *James Wyatt, Christopher Perkins, Darrin Drader.

Arrested by Allied authorities after the war, he committed suicide in prison in 1948. Career Otto von Stülpnagel was born on 16 June 1878 in Berlin. He was a member of the Stülpnagel family. He pursued a military career in keeping with his family’s long tradition of military service. Commissioned in 1898 and accepted as a member of the Imperial General Staff, he received several decorations for distinguished service on the western front during World War I. Nominated for the Pour le Mérite, Stülpnagel survived personnel cuts mandated by the Treaty of Versailles. Dismayed by accusations of German atrocities, he published an angry defence of German military conduct in a popular book entitled Die Wahrheit über die deutschen Kriegsverbrechen (The Truth about German War Crimes) (1921). Promoted to the rank Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) in 1931, Stülpnagel played a leading role in the Reichswehr in conjunction with Kurt von Schleicher and Erich Freiherr von dem Bussche-Ippenburg during the Weimar era. Transferred to the fledgling Luftwaffe in 1934, Stülpnagel eventually took charge of the air force academy before falling from favour and retiring in March 1939. Days before the German invasion of Poland, Hitler recalled Stülpnagel to active service and placed him in charge of a military district in Austria (Wehrkreise XVII), and he held the latter post for fourteen months. =Military Commander in France= On 25 October 1940, German army high command transferred Stülpnagel to France and placed him in charge of a military government with the title of Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich (MBF; \\"Military Commander in France\\"). Not without controversy, this last assignment defined Stülpnagel’s career. Orders from Hitler placed the army and the MBF in charge of \\"security\\" but allowed other state and Nazi party agencies to exercise a degree of influence in Occupied France. The German ambassador in Paris, Otto Abetz, first supervised and later controlled diplomatic relations between France and Germany, but that power amounted to little in practice. Hitler would not allow his ambassador to trade concessions for French cooperation, and formal negotiations between the Third Reich and Vichy France came to nought. With control of the flow of vital raw materials, food, and people across the demarcation line that separated occupied from unoccupied France, Stülpnagel could reward French cooperation by allowing people and goods to cross military checkpoints, or he could seal the borders and bring the French economy to a grinding halt. Control over both the demarcation line inside France and borders with Germany and Belgium gave the MBF considerable influence over German policy and French affairs. Thus Stülpnagel played a major role in Franco-German relations between October 1940 and January 1942. Determined to support the Nazi war effort by placing French industrial resources at the disposal of the German war economy, Stülpnagel discouraged all activities that did not advance the German war effort. The latter goal placed him at loggerheads with Nazi party stalwarts who viewed World War II as a struggle against Jews and their alleged Communist allies. Days after German troops occupied Paris, agents of the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce and German embassy staff began to confiscate the art collections of prominent French Jews. Upset by the apparent seizure of France's artistic patrimony, the French government complained to German diplomats and the MBF. Eager to maintain cordial relations with the Vichy regime, Stülpnagel and his staff condemned the confiscations through a series of protests that eventually reached Hitler's desk, but to no avail. Hitler eventually exempted the Einsatzstab from military control and sanctioned the wholesale theft of Jewish art collections. Conflict with the SS followed a similar pattern. Forced to accept an advisory role at the start of the Occupation, the SS complained of the alleged danger of the so-called 'Jewish menace' and pressed MBF to launch an active campaign against \\"racial opponents\\" in France, but lacked the authority to act independently. After French Resistance groups shot Colonel Karl Friedrich Hotz in Nantes on 20 October and Hans-Gottfried Reimers in Bordeaux on 21 October 1941, Hitler ordered Stülpnagel to execute 100-150 French hostages for each attack. The MBF immediately condemned Hitler's policy through official channels, treated both attacks as a single incident, and shot a total of 98 hostages. Determined to preserve French cooperation, Stülpnagel condemned large-scale executions. In contrast, the SS demonstrated its enthusiasm for Hitler's war against the so-called Jewish conspiracy by bombing seven synagogues in Paris on the night of 2/3 October 1941. Embarrassed by the attacks, Stülpnagel complained to superiors in Berlin, but his repeated protests only reiterated tepid support for Nazi racial policy. Suspecting the MBF of Francophilia, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, the head of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW; Armed Forces High Command) grew tired of Stülpnagel's complaints. On 2 February 1942, he directed the MBF to answer all acts of resistance with \\"sharp deterrents, including the execution of a large number of imprisoned Communists, Jews, or people who carried out previous attacks, and the arrest of at least 1,000 Jews or Communists for later evacuation.\\" Stülpnagel, who had executed 95 hostages on 15 December 1941, refused to go any further in the implementation of the retaliation policy. He promptly submitted a bitter letter of resignation. Succeeded by his cousin Carl- Heinrich von Stülpnagel, Stülpnagel may have suffered a nervous breakdown. He spent the remainder of the war with his wife in Berlin. =Imprisonment and death= Arrested by Allied authorities after Germany’s surrender, Stülpnagel was moved to a French military prison. Charged with war crimes by French authorities, Stülpnagel committed suicide in Cherche-Midi Prison on 6 February 1948. He is buried in the Champigny-Saint-André German war cemetery.

The program was an attempt to depict what would happen if the highly oil-dependent country was suddenly faced with gasoline costing upwards of $7 to $8 per gallon (as opposed to the national average of around $2 per gallon when the show first aired). Directed by James Erskine and written by Erskine and Caroline Levy, it originally aired on FX Networks on 5 June 2005, at 8 p.m. ET. The crisis arises from a hurricane destroying an important pipeline at Port Fourchon in Louisiana, a tanker collision closing a busy port, terrorist attacks and tension with Saudi Arabia over the oil trade, and other fictional events. The program followed the lives of several people - the owners of a mom-and-pop convenience store, a paramedic, stock market and oil analysts, government officials, and others - and includes a substantial amount of human drama. Plot Hurricane Julia, a Category 4 hurricane, strikes the Gulf of Mexico, making a direct hit on New Orleans, Louisiana, killing thousands of people and causing severe damage. Large numbers of offshore oil rigs in the Gulf, and a major pipeline and the primary nerve center of the Gulf Coast petroleum industry at Port Fourchon, Louisiana are destroyed. It shows how the effects of that disaster could have significant consequences throughout the United States, even in areas far removed from landfall. While the loss of life and property in the storm is staggering (with the death toll in the thousands and the damage in the billions), the greater impact is on the crippled energy industry. Due to the destruction at Port Fourchon and in the Gulf, oil prices skyrocket from $55 to $77 per barrel, and the United States government is forced to take immediate action to rebuild the Gulf's energy infrastructure. Once the storm passes, the government starts to rebuild the infrastructure at Port Fourchon (requiring a minimum of eight months) and repair or replace damaged offshore rigs (requiring a similar amount of time). Also, shipping that normally goes through Port Fourchon is rerouted to the Port of Houston; Houston's port facilities are open around-the-clock with higher-than-usual throughput, with attendant higher risk of accident. With widespread gas lines and prices over $3.00 per gallon, the U.S. persuades Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production by 1m barrels a day. The Saudi decision to aid America causes a backlash among a restive Muslim population already energized because of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Local terrorists stage an attack on an upscale shopping mall in Riyadh which (after intervention by Saudi special forces) kills about 300 Americans associated with multinational oil companies. This attack leads the U.S. to send troops to Saudi Arabia. In the meantime, the oil crisis escalates when two large tankers collide in the narrow Houston Ship Channel, shutting down the Channel. Once winter sets in, gas lines take a back seat to critical shortages of heating oil during a bitterly cold winter, with thousands dying in the cold. Some good news comes after the Houston Ship Channel is reopened, but on Christmas Day, the same Saudi terrorists blow up sections of the mammoth Ras Tanura refinery complex, killing 142 U.S. soldiers who were protecting the Saudi oil infrastructure; among the casualties is the eldest son of the convenience store owners. Oil prices reach $153 per barrel, and gas prices top $8 per gallon. Meanwhile, with a government budget crisis due to military and economic pressures, farm spending is cut dramatically, leading to a subplot in which the social and political effects of this are explored. A well-renowned agricultural leader organizes a 750,000-farmer march on Washington, leading to clashes with police and the leader being taken into custody. In the spring, the U.S. makes a deal with Russia to send of oil by tanker, but the oil companies involved subsequently make a deal with China, which, equally hungry for oil and with greater financial reserves, outbids the U.S. This leaves America in a state of chaos, as well leading to soul- searching on whether China has now become the world's economic superpower. The country considers fast-tracking development of alternative energy sources, but there is little that can be done in the short-term to alter an economy structurally dependent on cheap foreign oil. Later, the U.S. government, showing unexpected diplomatic skill, resurrects the Russian oil deal by agreeing to a $16 billion long-term investment in its oil industry, and the China-bound tankers change course to the United States. The crisis finally eases a year after Hurricane Julia, with Port Fourchon back at 80-percent capacity, the strategic petroleum reserve being replenished and tensions in Saudi Arabia stabilized. Oil prices drop from their highs at the height of the crisis to $73 per barrel, and gas prices nearing the $4 per gallon mark and dropping. However, the country has been through a stress as great as the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and now knowing that relying on OPEC for most of its foreign oil imports makes the United States vulnerable, Americans will never take cheap oil for granted again. Real-world events partly anticipated by the filmHurricane Katrina= The events of Hurricane Katrina, its economic impact and the ensuing price increases nearly parallel some of the events in the movie. However, the damage to US oil infrastructure was less severe than in the film, and the lack of the compounding events (shutdown of Port of Houston, loss of some of Saudi Arabia's supply) means the consequences of Katrina are much less than of the fictional Julia. However, especially given the coincidence of dates (in the film, Julia strikes in early September 2005), the similarity of the early impact of the two storms has been noted. On 28 August 2005, Hurricane Katrina was on a direct path to hit Port Fourchon and New Orleans. Many of the initial scenes of Hurricane Julia were playing out in real life with Hurricane Katrina, such as the mandatory evacuation of New Orleans, the opening of the Superdome as shelter, and the changing of traffic to contraflow. On 29 August 2005, Hurricane Katrina did not directly hit Port Fourchon but across Barataria Bay at Buras, but nonetheless some oil rigs were damaged. Saudi Arabia agreed to increase oil production to help. On 30 August 2005, many gas stations raised prices by a considerable amount putting most of America over $3.00/gallon, as shown in the movie. On 1 September 2005, gas stations throughout the country began to run out of fuel due to worries of mass shortages. Some stations in Atlanta, Georgia sold gas at nearly $6/gallon. Most of this was due to panic buying, as noted in the film, rather than physical shortage. Subsequently, as the extent of the damage became clearer, prices eased. The casualty numbers shown for New Orleans is also startlingly close to the casualties of Katrina. The Movies shows a little more than 1700 while the official number for Katrina is 1833. =Automotive layoffs= Both Ford and GM announced layoffs and plant closings in late 2005 and early 2006. However, while one reason for the layoffs was increased gasoline prices, it was not the sole reason for the layoffs. In addition, the layoffs were on a much smaller scale than the ones shown in the film. There was also the 2009 GM crisis in which General Motors requested and received Federal assistance. Unlike the mocumentary, GM did not die, it seemed \\"too big to fail\\" because maintaining automotive competition and the status quo seemed more important. =Attacks on Saudi refineries= In the film, al-Qaeda makes a terrorist attack on the oil facilities at Ras Tanura. On 24 February 2006 al-Qaeda attacked the nearby facility at Abqaiq, though no damage was inflicted on the facilities themselves.

Anti- Protestantism is bias, hatred or distrust against some or all branches of Protestantism and its followers. Anti-protestantism dates back to before the Protestant Reformation itself, as various pre-Protestant groups such as Arnoldists, Waldensians, Hussites and Lollards were persecuted in Roman Catholic Europe. Protestants were not tolerated throughout most of Europe until the Peace of Augsburg of 1555 approved Lutheranism as an alternative for Roman Catholicism as a state religion of various states within the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Calvinism was not recognized until the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. Other states, such as France, made similar agreements in the early stages of the Reformation. Poland–Lithuania had a long history of religious tolerance. However, the tolerance stopped after the Thirty Years' War in Germany, the persecution of Huguenots and the French Wars of Religion in France, the change in power between Protestant and Roman Catholic rulers after the death of Henry VIII of England in England, and the launch of the Counter-Reformation in Italy, Spain, Habsburg Austria and Poland-Lithuania. Anabaptism arose as a part of the Radical Reformation, lacking support of the state Lutheranism and Calvinism enjoyed, and thus was persecuted. Theological disagreement initially led to a Lutheran-Reformed rivalry in the Reformation. Protestants in Latin America were largely ostracized until the abolition of certain restrictions in the 20th century. Protestantism spread with Evangelicalism and Pentecostalism gaining the majority of followers. North America became a shelter for Protestants who were fleeing Europe after the persecution increased. Persecution of Protestants in Asia can be put under a common shield of the persecution Christians face in the Middle East and northern Africa, where Islam is the dominant religion.  History  Anti- Protestantism originated in a reaction by militant societies connected to the Roman Catholic Church alarmed at the spread of Protestantism following the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. Martin Luther's Proclamation occurred in 1517. By 1540, Pope Paul III had sanctioned the first society pledged to extinguish Protestantism. Christian Protestantism was denounced as heresy, and those supporting these doctrines were excommunicated as heretics. Thus by canon law and the practice and policies of the Holy Roman Empire of the time, Protestants were subject to persecution in those territories, such as Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, in which the Catholic rulers were then the dominant power. This movement was started by the reigning Pope and various political rulers with a more political stake in the controversy then a religious one. These princes instituted policies as part of the Spanish Inquisition, abuses of that crusade originally authorized for other reasons such as the Reconquista, and Morisco conversions, which ultimately led to the Counter Reformation and the edicts of the Council of Trent. Therefore, the political repercussions of various European rulers supporting Roman Catholicism for their own political reasons over the new Protestant groups, only subsequently branded as heretical after rejection by the adherents of these doctrines of the Edicts of the Council of Trent, resulted in religious wars and outbreaks of sectarian violence. The Protestants from the Tyrolean Zillertal valley who had to leave their home in 1837 Eastern Orthodoxy had comparatively little contact with Protestantism for geographic, linguistic and historical reasons. Protestant attempts to ally with Eastern Orthodoxy proved problematic. In general, most Orthodox had the impression that Protestantism was a new heresy that arose from various previous heresies. In 1771, Bishop Charles Walmesley published his General History of the Christian Church from her birth to her Final Triumphant States in Heaven chiefly deduced from the Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle, written under the pseudonym of Signor Pastorini. The book forecast the end of Protestantism by 1825 and was published in at least 15 editions and several languages. By the 19th century and later, some Eastern Orthodox thinkers, such as Berdyaev, Seraphim Rose, and John Romanides believed that Northern Europe had become secular or virtually atheist due to its having been Protestant earlier. In recent eras Orthodox anti-Protestantism has grown due to aggressive Protestant proselytization in predominantly Orthodox countries. =Reformation= Auto- da-fé of Valladolid, Spain, in which fourteen Protestants were burned at the stake for their Lutheran faith, on 21 May 1559 The Bartholomew's Day massacre Piedmontese Children Forced from their parents (October 1853, X, p.108) The Protestant Reformation led to a long period of warfare and communal violence between Catholic and Protestant factions, sometimes leading to massacres and forced suppression of the alternative views by the dominant faction in much of Europe. Anti-Protestantism originated in a reaction by the Catholic Church against the Reformation of the 16th century. Protestants were denounced as heretics and subject to persecution in those territories, such as Spain, Italy and the Netherlands in which the Catholics were the dominant power. This movement was orchestrated by popes and princes as the Counter Reformation. There were religious wars and eruptions of sectarian hatred such as the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572, part of the French Wars of Religion in some countries, though not in others. =Fascist Italy= Mussolini (far right) signing the Lateran Treaty (Vatican City, 11 February 1929) In 1870 the newly formed Kingdom of Italy annexed the remaining Papal States, depriving the Pope of his temporal power. However, Papal rule over Italy was later restored by the Italian Fascist régime (albeit on a greatly diminished scale) in 1929 as head of the Vatican City state; under Mussolini's dictatorship, Catholicism became the State religion of Fascist Italy. In 1938, the Italian Racial Laws and Manifesto of Race were promulgated by the Fascist régime to both outlaw and persecute Italian Jews and Protestants,; especially Evangelicals and Pentecostals. Thousands of Italian Jews and a small number of Protestants died in the Nazi concentration camps. =Francoist Spain= In Franco's authoritarian Spanish State (1936–1975), Protestantism was deliberately marginalized and persecuted. During the Civil War, Franco's regime persecuted the country's 30,000Payne, Stanley Spanish Catholicism: An Historical Overview, p. 186, 1984, University of Wisconsin Press Protestants, and forced many Protestant pastors to leave the country and various protestant leaders were executed.Raguer, H. (2011). Los protestantes y la Guerra Civil. El País. Once authoritarian rule was established, non-Catholic Bibles were confiscated by police and Protestant schools were closed. Although the 1945 Spanish Bill of Rights granted freedom of private worship, Protestants suffered legal discrimination and non-Catholic religious services were not permitted publicly, to the extent that they could not be in buildings which had exterior signs indicating it was a house of worship and that public activities were prohibited.Wood, James Edward Church and State in the Modern World, p. 3, 2005 Greenwood Publishing  Hostility to mainline Protestantism  Among theologically conservative Christians (including Catholics and Orthodox Christians, as well as Evangelicals and Protestant fundamentalists), mainline Protestant denominations are often characterized as being theologically liberal to the point where they are no longer true to the Bible or the historic Christian tradition. These perceptions are often linked to highly publicized events, such as the decision to endorse same-sex marriage by the United Church of Christ. While theological liberalism is clearly present within most mainline denominations, surveys show that many within the mainline denominations consider themselves moderate or conservative and holding traditional Christian theological views.Smith, Christian. American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving. University of Chicago Press. 1998  Hostility to Evangelicals  In the United States, critics of the policies adopted by the Religious Right, such as opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion, often equate evangelicalism as a movement with the Religious Right. Many evangelicals belong to this political movement, although it is a diverse movement that draws support from other Protestants, Jews, Mormons, Catholics, and Eastern Orthodox, among other non-evangelical groups. Some critics have even suggested that evangelicals are a kind of \\"fifth column\\" aimed at turning the United States or other nations into Christian theocracies. Cultural progressive activists have indicated fear of a potential Christian theocracy as one of the reasons for their opposition to the Christian Right. Some evangelical groups that hold to a Dispensationalist interpretation of Biblical prophecy have been accused of supporting Zionism and providing material support for Jewish settlers who build communities within Palestinian territories. Critics contend that these evangelicals support Israel in order to expedite the building of the Third Temple in Jerusalem, which Dispensationalists see as a requirement for the return of Jesus Christ. Many evangelicals reject Dispensationalism and support peace efforts in the Middle East, however. Some Christian groups focused on the Bible have been derided as \\"Bible thumpers\\". Depictions of evangelicals as uneducated rubes or hypocrites are common in Hollywood movies and television shows, such as Saved!, Shawshank Redemption, There Will Be Blood and Inherit the Wind.  Catholic and Protestant disagreement in Ireland  Woodcut showing Luther and the reformers as the Antichrist In Northern Ireland or pre-Catholic Emancipation Ireland, there is a hostility to Protestantism as a whole that has more to do with communal or nationalist sentiments than theological issues. During the Tudor conquest of Ireland by the Protestant state of England in the course of the 16th century, the Elizabethan state failed to convert Irish Catholics to Protestantism and thus followed a vigorous policy of confiscation, deportation, and resettlement. By dispossessing Catholics of their lands, and resettling Protestants on them, the official Government policy was to encourage a widespread campaign of proselytizing by Protestant settlers and establishment of English law in these areas. This led to a counter effort of the Counter Reformation by mostly Jesuit Catholic clergy to maintain the \\"old religion\\" of the people as the dominant religion in these regions. The result was that Catholicism came to be identified with a sense of nativism and Protestantism came to be identified with the State, as most Protestant communities were established by state policy, and Catholicism was viewed as treason to the state after this time. While Elizabeth I had initially tolerated private Catholic worship, this ended after Pope Pius V, in his 1570 papal bull Regnans in Excelsis, pronounced her to be illegitimate and unworthy of her subjects' allegiance. The Penal Laws, first introduced in the early 17th century, were initially designed to force the native elite to conform to the state church by excluding non-Conformists and Roman Catholics from public office, and restricting land ownership, but were later, starting under Queen Elizabeth, also used to confiscate virtually all Catholic owned land and grant it to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland. The Penal Laws had a lasting effect on the population, due to their severity (celebrating Catholicism in any form was punishable by death or enslavement under the laws), and the favouritism granted Irish Anglicans served to polarise the community in terms of religion. Anti-Protestantism in Early Modern Ireland 1536–1691 thus was also largely a form of hostility to the colonisation of Ireland. Irish poetry of this era shows a marked antipathy to Protestantism, one such poem reading, \\"The faith of Christ [Catholicism] with the faith of Luther is like ashes in the snow\\". The mixture of resistance to colonization and religious disagreements led to widespread massacres of Protestant settlers in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Subsequent religious or sectarian antipathy was fueled by the atrocities committed by both sides in the Irish Confederate Wars, especially the repression of Catholicism during and after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, when Irish Catholic land was confiscated en masse, clergy were executed and discriminatory legislation was passed against Catholics. The Penal Laws against Catholics (and also Presbyterians) were renewed in the late 17th and early 18th centuries due to fear of Catholic support for Jacobitism after the Williamite War in Ireland and were slowly repealed in 1771–1829. Penal Laws against Presbyterians were relaxed by the Toleration Act of 1719, due to their siding with the Jacobites in a 1715 rebellion. At the time the Penal Laws were in effect, Presbyterians and other non-Conformist Protestants left Ireland and settled in other countries. Some 250,000 left for the New World alone between the years 1717 and 1774, most of them arriving there from Ulster. Sectarian conflict was continued in the late 18th century in the form of communal violence between rival Catholic and Protestant factions over land and trading rights (see Defenders (Ireland), Peep O'Day Boys and Orange Institution). The 1820s and 1830s in Ireland saw a major attempt by Protestant evangelists to convert Catholics, a campaign which caused great resentment among Catholics. In modern Irish nationalism, anti- Protestantism is usually more nationalist than religious in tone. The main reason for this is the identification of Protestants with unionism – i.e. the support for the maintenance of the union with the United Kingdom, and opposition to Home Rule or Irish independence. In Northern Ireland, since the foundation of the Free State in 1921, Catholics, who were mainly nationalists, suffered systematic discrimination from the Protestant unionist majority. The same happened to Protestants in the Catholic-dominated South. The Cameron Report – Disturbances in Northern Ireland (1969) The mixture of religious and national identities on both sides reinforces both anti-Catholic and anti- Protestant sectarian prejudice in the province. More specifically religious anti-Protestantism in Ireland was evidenced by the acceptance of the Ne Temere decrees in the early 20th century, whereby the Catholic Church decreed that all children born into mixed Catholic-Protestant marriages had to be brought up as Catholics. Protestants in Northern Ireland had long held that their religious liberty would be threatened under a 32-county Republic of Ireland, due to that country's Constitutional support of a \\"special place\\" for the Roman Catholic Church.

He is sometimes referred to as Caspar Wistar the Younger, to distinguish him from his grandfather of the same name. Biography He was born at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Richard Wistar (1727–1781) and Sarah Wyatt (1733–1771).Penn Biographies: Caspar Wistar (1761-1818) He was the grandson of Caspar Wistar (1696–1752), a German immigrant, Quaker and glassmaker.Faust reports that the family name was originally Vüster, and the American spellings have been Wister and Wistar. This information he gathered from a personal communication from Owen Wister. See Albert Bernhardt Faust, The German Element in the United States, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1909, v. II, chap. VII, p. 357. =Education= He was educated at the Friends' school in his native city, where he received a thorough classical training. His interest in medicine began while he was aiding in the care of the wounded after the battle of Germantown, and he made his first studies under the direction of Dr. John Redman. He studied medicine, first at the University of Pennsylvania (receiving his Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1782), and then at the University of Edinburgh (receiving his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1786). While in Scotland he was, for two successive years, president of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh, and also president of a society for the further investigation of natural history. =Career= Upon his return to the U.S. in January 1787, he entered on the practice of his profession in Philadelphia, where he was at once appointed one of the physicians to the Philadelphia Dispensary. He was professor of chemistry and the institutes of medicine in the College of Philadelphia from 1789 till 1792, when the faculty of that institution united with the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania, of which he was adjunct professor of anatomy, midwifery, and surgery until 1808. In that year, on the death of his associate, Dr. William Shippen Jr., he was given the chair of anatomy, which he retained until his death. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1803. Bones of the prehistoric giant ground sloth, described in a 1799 paper for the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society by Wistar For his teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, he developed a set of anatomical models—human remains preserved by injecting them with wax—to assist with the teaching of anatomy. He published A System of Anatomy in two volumes from 1811 to 1814. His fame attracted students to his lectures, and he was largely the means of establishing the reputation of the school. Meanwhile, he was chosen physician to the Pennsylvania Hospital, where he remained until 1810. His reputation as an anatomist was increased by his description of the posterior portion of the ethmoid bone with the triangular bones attached, which received universal recognition as an original treatment of the subject. He was an early promoter of vaccination. During the yellow fever epidemic of 1793, he suffered an attack of the disease contracted while caring for his patients. It was his habit to throw open his house once every week in the winter, and at these gatherings students, citizens, scientists, and travelers met and discussed subjects of interest. These assemblies, celebrated in the annals of Philadelphia under the title of Wistar parties, were continued long after his death by other residents of that city. The American College of Physicians elected him a fellow in 1787, and he was appointed one of its censors in 1794, which place he retained until his death. In 1787 he was elected to membership of the American Philosophical Society, was chosen its vice-president in 1795, and on the resignation of Thomas Jefferson, in 1815, served as president until his death. He also served as president of the Society for the Abolition of Slavery, succeeding Benjamin Rush. The botanist Thomas Nuttall named the genus Wisteria in his honour (some call it Wistaria but the misspelling is conserved under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature). The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology at the University of Pennsylvania, founded in 1892 by his great-nephew, Isaac Jones Wistar, is also named for Caspar Wistar. Wistar was a friend of Thomas Jefferson, with whom he worked to identify bones of the megalonyx and through whom he sent Meriwether Lewis some recommendations for scientific inquiry on the Lewis and Clark expedition. Family In 1788 he married Isabella Marshall, who died in 1790. He married Elizabeth Mifflin in 1798. His brother Richard (20 July 1756 – 6 June 1821) was a Philadelphia merchant who built a large four-story store in 1790 where he conducted an iron and hardware business. With the profits, he purchased lands and houses in the vicinity of Philadelphia. During the Revolutionary War, Richard advocated the defense of his property by arms, which resulted in his being disowned by the Society of Friends. Richard was an inspector of prisons, and was one of the early friends and supporters of the Library Company of Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Hospital. Caspar was a cousin of Revolutionary diarist Sally Wister and nephew of Samuel Morris.  Death  Wistar died on January 22, 1818, of a \\"severe attack of typhus fever\\".

The name comes from the observation by early American settlers that it was very sensitive to frost, the fronds dying quickly when first touched by it. It is sometimes treated as the only species in Onoclea,http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon;_id=122936 but some authors do not consider the genus monotypic.Christenhusz, M. J. M., et al. (2011) Description \\"Beads\\" The sterile and fertile fronds of Onoclea sensibilis are quite different from other ferns. The bright, yellow-green sterile fronds are deeply pinnatifid and are typically borne at intervals along a creeping rhizome. They grow to about long, with a long, smooth stipe. The fertile fronds are much smaller, non-green, and have very narrow pinnae. The sori are clustered like beads or grapes on the upright fertile fronds, hence the common name Bead fern. The fiddleheads are a pale red color. Distribution and habitat Onoclea sensibilis is native to the Russian Far East, China and Eastern Asia, and has a wide native distribution in Northern America. Onoclea sensibilis dwells in a variety of wet swamp and wood habitats: wet meadows, thickets and bogs, as well as stream and riverbanks and roadside ditches. It ranges from Newfoundland south to Florida and west to Texas, the Rocky Mountains, North Dakota, Quebec, and Manitoba.http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ONSE It is also native to East Asia, and has become naturalized in western Europe. It grows best in a shaded or partially shaded area in a moist soil. The plant can tolerate dryer conditions in shade, and will tolerate wet soils and so occurs in soggy ground or at the very edge of water in shade or sun. Sensitive ferns spread to form colonies and are often the first species to inhabit disturbed areas. They can become weedy if not sited properly. Onoclea sensibilis is a facultative wetland indicator, toxic, and a host to the pathogen which causes bacterial wilt in rice. Cultivation Gametophyte (the flat thallus at the bottom of the picture) with a descendant sporophyte beginning to grow from it (the small frond at the top of the picture). Onoclea sensibilis is cultivated as an ornamental plant, in traditional and native plant gardens, and in natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects.http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your- garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/l300/onoclea-sensibilis.aspx It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. In shade it can tolerate drier conditions, but in full sun it requires wet soil. Winter survival will be enhanced if the dried fronds are left on the plant through the winter.

Abraham in History and Tradition is a book by biblical scholar John Van Seters. The book is divided into two parts, Abraham in History and Abraham in Tradition. In Part I, Van Seters argues that there is no unambiguous evidence pointing to an origin for the stories in the 2nd millennium BC. \\"Arguments based on reconstructing the patriarch's nomadic way of life, the personal names in Genesis, the social customs reflected in the stories, and correlation of the traditions of Genesis with the archaeological data of the Middle Bronze Age have all been found, in Part One above, to be quite defective in demonstrating an origin for the Abraham tradition in the second millennium B.C.\\". This finding has implications for certain then- current strands in Biblical criticism: \\"Consequently, without any such effective historical controls on the tradition one cannot use any part of it in an attempt to reconstruct the primitive period of Israelite history. Furthermore, a vague presupposition about the antiquity of the tradition based upon a consensus approval of such arguments should no longer be used as a warrant for proposing a history of the tradition related to early premonarchic times.\\" Part II forms a critique of \\"tradition-history\\" or \\"tradition- analysis\\", the theory current at the time that Genesis retained traces of oral traditions dating from the 2nd millennium. \\"There is virtually no way of deciding when oral narrative forms or motifs became associated with a particular person such as Abraham, and it could well have happened in every case when the story was first put in written form. The results of the literary examination of the Abraham tradition, in Part Two, would suggest that oral forms and motifs are confined to a rather small part of the tradition.\\" ImpactOn \\"Biblical archaeology\\" and the Albright school= The book was a landmark in Near Eastern Studies and Biblical archaeology, since it challenged the dominant view, popularised by William Foxwell Albright, that the patriarchal narratives of Genesis can be identified on archaeological grounds with the Mesopotamian world of 2nd millennium BC. Van Seters noted that many of Albright's parallels were vague, and fit other regions than Mesopotamia and other times than 2nd millennium. Specially severe was his analysis of Genesis 14, where he pointed out that the political situation described in Genesis 14 - a Near East dominated by a coalition led by Elam and including Hatti, Assyria and Babylonia - is not confirmed by any monuments, king lists, or other historical and archaeological sources. Van Seters also pointed out that the ten kings mentioned in Genesis 14 cannot be found in any ancient documents outside the Bible. =On \\"Tradition history\\"= The book was also a criticism of the school of Tradition history advanced most notably by Hermann Gunkel and Martin Noth: Van Seters \\"argues that Noth's (1948) idea of a \\"pentateuchal oral tradition\\" is flawed both historically (with respect to the history of Israel) and analogically (given Noth's comparisons with the development of Icelandic saga) [and] contends that traces of folkloric structure do not make it inevitable 'that the tradition as a whole, or even [certain] parts of it, derive from a pre-literate period'\\".Centre for Studies in Oral Tradition Van Seters instead proposed that Genesis was an essentially literary work, but one based on a process of supplementation by successive authors rather on a redactorial process (i.e., on the combination of separate documents by an editor or editors). This in turn amounted to a major challenge to the Documentary Hypothesis, the dominant theory concerning the origins of the Pentateuch. =On the \\"documentary hypothesis\\" and the formation of the Torah= At the time Van Seters published \\"Abraham in History and Tradition\\" the dominant scholarly theory regarding the composition of the Pentateuch was the Documentary Hypothesis. This held that the books of the Torah, including the Genesis accounts of Abraham and the Patriarchs, were based on four independent sources. Each of these was originally a complete document in itself, dating from between the 10th and 7th centuries BC and combined into the final work by a Redactor (editor) in the Persian period, c.450 BC. Van Seters retained the idea of source documents but dropped the idea of a redactor, which meant dropping the documentary model itself. In its place he adopted a supplemental model, \\"a successive supplementation of one source or author by another,\\" in which a Yahwist (not identical with Wellhausen's Yahwist) working in the period of the Babylonian exile was the major but not the final author of Genesis. Van Seter's schema is as follows: * i. Pre- Yahwistic first stage: 12:1, 4a, 6a, 7, 10-20; 13:1-2; I6:1-3a, 4-9, IIab, 12; 13:18; 18:1a, 10-14; 21:2, 6-7 (all except the references to Lot). These represent a small unified work with three episodes and a brief framework. * ii. Pre-Yahwistic second stage (\\"E\\"): 20:1-17; 21:25-26, 28-31a. This represents one unified story that originally came after the adventure in Egypt (13:1), to which it was added. It was subsequently transposed to its present position by the Yahwist, who added 20:iii. Ia (\\"From there ... Negeb\\") as a transition. * Yahwist: :a. brief secondary additions to previous works: 12:2-3, 6b, c8-9; 16:7b, 10, 11c, 13-14; 20:Iaα; 21:I. :b. larger episodic units: 13:3-5, 7-17; chap. 15; 18:Ib-9, I5-19:38; 21:8-24, 27, 3Ib-34; chap. 22; chap. 24; 25:I-6, II; (chap. 26). All incorporated with some new arrangement of the materials. * iv.

The archdiocese was the Diocese of Vincennes from 1834 to 1898, and the Diocese of Indianapolis from 1898 to 1944. =Early mission (1675–1834)= The origins of the Catholic mission churches in the area that is now Indiana date to the late seventeenth century, when the Catholic parishes in the area were under the authority of the Diocese of Quebec. It is believed that French Jesuit missionaries first arrived in the area that included present-day Vincennes, Indiana, around 1675. Vincennes was the first seat for the episcopal see.Alerding and Chatard, p. 50. The earliest Catholic church at Vincennes was established around 1732 as Saint Francis Xavier, and served as the cathedral church for the Diocese of Vincennes from 1834 to 1898. Father Sebastian Louis Meurin, Saint Francis Xavier's first resident priest, arrived in May 1748. The parish's earliest records date from April 21, 1749. Following Father Meurin's departure from Vincennes in 1753, several itinerant priests visited the Catholic parish, including Father Pierre Gibault, who served as resident priest at Saint Francis Xavier from 1785 to 1789.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 57 and 61–63. In these early years, the Catholic communities in the area experienced hardships during the American Revolution, conflicts with Native Americans, and suffered from epidemics that swept through the frontier. They also lacked financial resources and sufficient priests.Kennedy, p. 8. On November 6, 1789, Pope Pius VI erected the Diocese of Baltimore, the first Catholic diocese in the United States, and the area that became Indiana fell under the authority of John Carroll, Bishop of Baltimore.Godecker, pp. 162–64. In 1791 Bishop Carroll sent Father Benedict Joseph Flaget to succeed Father Gibault at the fledgling Saint Francis Xavier Parish.Kennedy, p. 9. Father Flaget, who arrived at Vincennes in 1792, opened a school and held classes at Saint Francis Xavier before he was recalled to Baltimore in 1795.Godecker, pp. 166–67, and 174. John Francis Rivet, who came to Vincennes in 1796 as Father Flaget's successor, received an annual teacher's salary of $200 from the U.S. Congress, making him the first public school teacher in the Northwest Territory.Shake, p. 20. In 1808, Pope Pius VII divided the Catholic churches in the United States and its territories into five dioceses. the Catholic parishes in the northwest territories came under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Bardstown, with Benedict Flaget appointed as its first bishop.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 29 and 81–83. In 1832, Bishop Flaget and Bishop Joseph Rosati, the first bishop of the Diocese of Saint Louis, Missouri, petitioned the Holy See to name Father Simon Bruté de Rémur as the first Bishop of Vincennes.Kennedy, pp. 12–15.Alerding and Chatard, p. 94. =Diocese of Vincennes (1834–1898)= Fresco in the St. Francis Xavier Basilica undercroft showing the national flags under which the Diocese of Vincennes existed On May 6, 1834, Pope Gregory XVI issued a Papal Bull to erect the Diocese of Vincennes, the first episcopal see in Indiana.Alerding and Chatard, p. 29. Father Bruté was consecrated as the first Bishop of Vincennes on October 28, 1834, at Saint Louis.Godecker, p. 220. At the time of his installation there were only three priests in his diocese, which covered all of Indiana and the eastern third of Illinois.Kennedy, p. 12–15. Bishop Bruté made a point to visit each Catholic family in the new diocese, regardless of the distance from his rectory at Vincennes.Kennedy, p. 17. In 1837, he founded a college at Vincennes, and connected it to a local theological seminary that had been established under the Eudists.Shake, p. 22. Bishop Bruté's devotion to the diocese also contributed to his demise. He became ill while attending a provincial council in Baltimore, Maryland. The illness weakened the bishop's immune system, but he continued his duties until his death at Vincennes on June 26, 1839.Godecker, p. 390 and 403. Father Célestine Guynemer de la Hailandière, Bishop Bruté's vicar general, was consecrated as Bishop of Vincennes on August 18, 1839.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 166–67. Among the new bishop's most significant achievements were completing Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral, which he consecrated on August 8, 1841, and construction of a library at Vincennes to house Bishop Bruté's collection of more than 5,000 books and religious documents. Under Bishop Hailandière's leadership the diocese also expanded its services. The Sisters of Providence established its order within the diocese and the Brothers of the Holy Cross to established schools for boys. Father Edward Sorin, founder of the University of Notre Dame, and Mother Théodore Guérin, founder of Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, also joined Bishop Hailandière in Indiana.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 170–71. Despite Bishop Hailandière's efforts, Indiana's population grew slowly and the institutions he helped to establish experienced many problems. In 1843 the diocese was divided and the Illinois portion became the Diocese of Chicago. Bishop Hailandière resigned in 1847.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 176–77 and 206.Kennedy, p. 21. John Stephen Bazin, Bishop Hailandière's successor, was appointed Bishop of Vincennes on September 3, 1847. Bishop Bazin's consecration took place at Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral on October 24, 1847,Alerding and Chatard, p. 187. making him the first bishop to be ordained in Indiana. Poor health shortened his service to the diocese. The new bishop quickly appointed Jacques Maurice de St. Palais, his vicar general, as the diocesan administrator. Bishop Bazin died at Vincennes on April 23, 1848, having served the diocese for six months.Kennedy, p. 25.Alerding and Chatard, p. 189. Bishop Bazin's successor, Jacques Maurice de St. Palais, was consecrated as Bishop of Vincennes on January 14, 1849, at Vincennes.Alerding and Chatard, p. 195. During his tenure as bishop, St. Palais had to contend with unresolved monetary issues from Hailandière's episcopacy, a cholera epidemic, and expanding the educational and ministerial opportunities within the diocese. In 1849, Mother Theodore Guerin established an orphanage in Vincennes, and in 1853, monks from Einsiedeln, Switzerland, founded Saint Meinrad abbey and seminary in southern Indiana, but plans to open a school for African Americans were never carried out.Kennedy, pp. 27–30.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 196–97. In 1857, the Holy See established the Diocese of Fort Wayne, a suffragan diocese in the northern half of Indiana at Fort Wayne. During the American Civil War, Bishop St. Palais had to contend with the call for soldiers, and several priests from the diocese served as chaplains. In 1864, one priest from the diocese, Father Ernest Audran, was drafted as a soldier. Bishop St. Palais did not address the topic of the Emancipation Proclamation because he feared that doing so would venture too far into politics.Kennedy, p. 32. Although Bishop St. Palais recognized that Indianapolis had become a major city (the eighth largest in the United States by 1870), he deferred the decision to move the seat of the diocese to his successor, Silas Chatard.Kennedy, p. 35. At the time of the bishop's death in 1877, the diocese had grown to include 151 churches, 117 priests, and 90,000 parishioners.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 195 and 207–09. Silas Chatard, Indiana's first American-born bishop, was consecrated as Bishop of Vincennes in Rome, Italy, on May 12, 1878.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 215–16.Kennedy, p. 37. Bishop Chatard also obtained permission from Pope Leo XIII to move the bishop's residence and diocesan chancery to Indianapolis in 1878, but the episcopal see remained at Vincennes.Divita, p. 5.Alerding and Chatard, p. 217. Anticipating the eventual relocation of the episcopal see to Indianapolis, Bishop Chatard established Saints Peter and Paul Parish as a new parish on the city's near north side, where he planned to construct a new cathedral.Divita, p. 25, 29, and 37. Chatard's tenure as bishop was also marked by his poor health.Kennedy, p. 39. =Diocese of Indianapolis (1898–1944)= On March 28, 1898, Pope Leo XIII transferred the episcopal see from Vincennes to Indianapolis, and it became the Diocese of Indianapolis. Bishop Chatard was the first Bishop of Indianapolis. Saint John the Evangelist Church in Indianapolis served as the pro-cathedral of the diocese until Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral was completed in 1907.Kennedy, p. 90.Divita, p. 37. Bishop Chatard, who was paralyzed by a stroke in 1900, died on September 7, 1918, at Indianapolis. Bishop Chatard's successor, Joseph Chartrand, expanded the educational opportunities for young children in the diocese, which opened more than 25 elementary and secondary schools in Chartrand's first 14 years as bishop. When Bishop Chartrand died in 1933, the diocese had 126 parochial schools and 19 secondary schools. He also faced much adversity, such as the outbreak of World War I and the rise of Communism. Bishop Chartrand dealt with threats from the Ku Klux Klan by publishing a list of Klan members in the Indianapolis Times newspaper. During the Great Depression he exempted the entire diocese from fasting, with the exception of Fridays during Lent.Kennedy, pp. 42–46. (He was appointed Archbishop of Cincinnati, and Bishop John McNicholas appointed Bishop of Indianapolis, in 1925, but Bishop Chartrand declined the Cincinnati appointment. So, the two Bishops switched places, with Bishop Chartrand being reappointed to Indianapolis.) =Archdiocese of Indianapolis (1944–present)= Joseph Elmer Ritter, who served as auxiliary bishop and vicar general for the diocese, succeeded Chartrand as Bishop of Indianapolis in March 1934. In 1937, seventeen years before Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional, Bishop Ritter ordered the integration of three girls' schools in the diocese to allow enrollment for students of all races. In 1942, he integrated the Catholic high school in Evansville, Indiana.Kennedy, pp. 47–50. In October 1944, Pope Pius XII elevated the Diocese of Indianapolis to a metropolitan archdiocese. Bishop Ritter was named the first Archbishop of Indianapolis. The Pope also founded the Diocese of Evansville and the Diocese of Lafayette, two suffragan sees in Indiana. In 1946, Archbishop Ritter left Indianapolis to become Archbishop of Saint Louis; he became a Cardinal Priest in 1961. Archbishop Paul Clarance Schulte led the archdiocese from 1946 until 1970, and was called to Rome for the Second Vatican Council. He was known for his humility, for building three high schools in the Indianapolis area and seventeen churches in the archdiocese, and for his leadership during the tumultuous 1960s.Kennedy, pp. 53–55. On December 17, 1956, during Schulte's tenure as Archbishop of Indianapolis, the Diocese of Gary was erected in northwestern Indiana. Archbishop Schulte resigned from the post in Indianapolis in 1970. Upon his retirement in 1984, he was the oldest and longest-serving bishop in the United States. George Joseph Biskup, who became Archbishop of Indianapolis in 1970, established the first Priests Senate in order to expedite decisions and encourage communications between the archbishop and the priests within the archdiocese.Kennedy, pp. 56–58. Edward T. O'Meara, who was installed as the Archbishop of Indianapolis in 1980, reorganized the archdiocesan offices and consolidated many of them into one location at the former Cathedral High School, across the street from Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Indianapolis. The renovated school was renamed the Catholic Center. Archbishop O'Meara was also concerned about the shortage of priests within the archdiocese. Although the archbishop did not believe that ordination female clergy was a solution to the problem, he appointed women to key roles. Archbishop O'Meara also supported pro-life issues and the needs of the poor.Kennedy, pp. 62–63. The archdiocese celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1984. Théodore Guérin Archbishop O'Meara's successor, Daniel M. Buechlein, became Archbishop of Indianapolis in September 1992. He continued his ministry of devotion to pro-life issues, Catholic education, and poor relief. Because of his focus on education, the news media designated him the \\"education bishop.\\" Pope Benedict XVI appointed Christopher Coyne to assist the ailing Buechlein with his duties in March 2011, and on September 21, 2011, the Holy See granted Archbishop Buechlein an early retirement at the age of 73, due to health issues. Auxiliary Bishop Coyne served as Apostolic Administrator until October 2012, when Joseph Tobin was appointed Archbishop of Indianapolis.Kennedy, p. 66.On December 22, 2014, Pope Francis chose Bishop Coyne as the new bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington, Vermont. See Archbishop-designate Charles C. Thompson was appointed Archbishop of Indianapolis by Pope Francis on June 13, 2017. His Installation Mass was on Friday, 28 July 2017, when he also received the Pallium, the insignia of his role as Metropolitan of the Indiana Province. A Catholic high school teacher in a same-sex marriage was fired and afterward sued the Archdiocese of Indianapolis on July 10, 2019, for discrimination and interfering with his teaching contract. They had reached a settlement in which the school will help with future employment opportunities. Meanwhile, the archdiocese said Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis is no longer recognized as a Catholic institution due to its refusal to fire a teacher in a same-sex marriage. Patronage The patron saints of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis are Saints Francis Xavier and Theodora Guerin. Saint Francis Xavier was the patron of the first cathedral of the diocese, and therefore also of the diocese. Saint Theodora Guerin was the first saint canonized from the archdiocese and was recognized as patroness of the archdiocese in 2006. Cathedral Interior of the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul Since 1834 three parish churches have served as diocesan cathedrals or as pro-cathedrals. Saint Francis Xavier in Vincennes was the cathedral for the diocese from 1834 to 1898. Saint John the Evangelist Church in Indianapolis served as the pro- cathedral for the diocese from 1878 to 1906. Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Indianapolis began its service as the cathedral church in 1906. =Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral= St. Francis Xavier Basilica (Vincennes, Indiana) Saint Francis Xavier Basilica, a Greek Revival-style church, dates to 1826, making it the oldest Catholic church in Indiana. It is similar in design to the Bardstown Cathedral in Kentucky. Pope Paul VI elevated the historic cathedral to the status of a minor basilica in 1970. The cornerstone for Saint Francis Xavier Church was laid on March 30, 1826.Godecker, p. 186.Divita, pp. 10–11 The first services were held in the new church during the summer of 1827, although the interior was not yet complete.Godecker, p. 185. A bell tower designed by the architect Jean-Marie Marsile was added in the 1830s.Shake, pp. 14–15. On May 6, 1834, when Pope Gregory XVI issued a Papal Bull to erect the Diocese of Vincennes, Saint Francis Xavier became the cathedral church for the new diocese. The church was still unfinished when Bishop Bruté, the first Bishop of Vincennes, arrived in 1834. Bishop Hailandière continued work to complete the cathedral, which he consecrated on August 8, 1841.Divita, pp. 11–14. Saint Francis Xavier served as the diocesan cathedral until 1898, when the episcopal see was transferred to Indianapolis. The remains of the first four Bishops of Vincennes (Bruté, Hailandière, Bazin, and St. Palais) are buried in Saint Francis Xavier's crypt.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 160–61, 189, 209, and 225. The cathedral's interior features three large murals painted in 1870 by Wilhelm Lamprecht, a German artist. These include a Crucifixion scene, the Virgin Mary with the patron saints of the first four bishops of Vincennes (Saints Simon, Celestine, Stephen, and Maurice), and Saint Francis Xavier, the parish's patron saint. Fourteen oil paintings from France were procured for the Stations of the Cross. =Saint John the Evangelist Church= St. John the Evangelist Church (Indianapolis, Indiana) In the early 1870s, when Bishop St. Palais visited Indianapolis, he resided at Saint John the Evangelist Church's rectory and used the parish church as the pro-cathedral for the diocese.Divita, pp. 21–23.Horan, pp. 113–15 and 119–22. His successor, Bishop Silas Chatard, formally obtained permission from Pope Leo XIII to establish the bishop's residence and chancery at Indianapolis in 1878. When Bishop Chatard moved to Indianapolis, many considered Saint John as a diocesan cathedral, but it was never officially named as such. Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral remained the official cathedral and Vincennes as the see city for the diocese until March 28, 1898, when Pope Leo XIII officially transferred the episcopal see to Indianapolis and it became the Diocese of Indianapolis.Alerding and Chatard, pp. 215–17.Kennedy, pp. 37 and 90. The rectory at Saint John served as the bishop's residence from August 1878 until April 18, 1892, when Bishop Chatard moved into the new rectory at Fourteenth and Meridian Streets in Indianapolis.Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 1215.Horan, p. 158. The rectory at Saint John continued to house the diocesan chancery until 1968, and it served as the metropolitan tribunal for the diocese until 1982.Divita, pp. 32–33. Saint John Church is the main structure in a cluster of parish buildings on the southwest corner of Georgia Street and Capitol Avenue in Indianapolis. Diedrich A. Bohlen, principal and founder of the architectural firm of D. A. Bohlen and Son, designed the rectory (1863), the present-day Saint Johns Church (1867–71) and the rectory addition (1878).Horan, p. 146. Construction on Saint John Church, which includes a mix of American Romanesque Revival and French Gothic Revival architectural styles, began in April 1867. Bishop St. Palais laid its cornerstone on July 21, 1867, and John B. Purcell, Archbishop of Cincinnati, dedicated the new church on July 2, 1871. Bohlen's son, Oscar, designed the twin spires on the towers that flank the main facade and supervised their construction. Due to the expense, the spires were not added until 1893, more than twenty years after the church's dedication.Kennedy, p. 95. Guy Leber, an Italian-Swiss painter from Louisville, Kentucky, painted the ceiling of the apse at Saint John with The Angels of Glory (white-robed angels and halo- crowned seraphs).Divita, p. 25. L. Chovet of Paris, France, provided paintings for the Stations of the Cross.Horan, p. 121. In 1971, on the centennial anniversary of its dedication, the interior of the church was refurbished with the generosity of Monsignor Charles P. Koster. In the confusion following the Second Vatican Council, the communion rail was removed, the altar was repositioned to allow the priest to face the congregation, and the baptismal font was moved to the left transept. =Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral= Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral Parish serves as the seat of the archdiocese. The parish originated in 1892, when Bishop Chatard formally established it in a residential neighborhood north of downtown Indianapolis. Construction for a chapel and rectory at Fourteenth and Meridian Streets began in 1891. The chapel was dedicated on March 25, 1892, and Bishop Chatard moved into the rectory on April 18, 1892. Anticipating the episcopal see's relocation from Vincennes to Indianapolis, Bishop Chatard purchased additional lots at Fourteenth and Meridian Streets in July 1894 to allow for additional space to build a cathedral.Divita, p. 29 and 33. Saints Peter and Paul became the cathedral parish for the diocese on March 28, 1898, when Pope Leo XIII officially transferred the seat of the diocese to Indianapolis. At that time Bishop Chatard proceeded with plans to raise fund to build a new cathedral. Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral was built between 1905 and 1907 with a temporary facade.Divita, pp. 33–35. James Renwick Jr.'s architectural firm of Renwick, Aspinwall and Russell, W. L. Coulter of New York designed the Classical Revival-style cathedral, rectory, and adjacent chapel. It is believed the design for the cathedral is modeled after Saint John Lateran in Rome, Italy.Divita, p. 31. William Whetten Renwick, nephew of American architect James Renwick Jr., assumed sole responsibility for the completion of the cathedral around 1900, a few years after James's death, and simplified its design. The Indianapolis architectural firm of D. A. Bohlen and Son served as local supervisors for the construction project. The high altar of the unfinished Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral was consecrated on December 21, 1906, and the first Pontifical High Mass at the new cathedral took place on December 25, 1906.Divita, p. 32 and 38. Construction of the permanent facade and twin spires was postponed due to a shortage of funds. Bishop Ritter arranged for the completion of the cathedral in 1936, when Indianapolis architect August Bohlen, son of Oscar and grandson of Diedrich Bohlen, supervised construction of the permanent facade, which was designed by Layton (Dick) DeMilt of the Bohlen architectural firm.Divita, pp. 48–51.Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 333 and 1215. The permanent facade was also modeled after Saint John Lateran in Rome.Divita, p. 50. The original interior of cathedral was ornately decorated. Major renovations and additions made in 1915, 1936, and 1985 have altered its appearance.Divita, pp. 35–39, 48–50, and 55. William Renwick designed the cathedral's original interior decorations, including three altars, doorway and arch decoration, metal ceiling, and frames for the Stations of the Cross. D. A. Bohlen and Son designed the original baptismal fonts and dark oak furnishings.Divita, pp. 35–37. In 1936 the original murals by Edgar S. Cameron of Chicago were covered with glass mosaics that depicted an enthroned Christ in Majesty flanked by Saints Peter and Paul.Divita, pp. 37–42 and 51–54. Bishop Chatard commissioned Cesare Aureli, a Roman sculptor, to carve the cathedral's Blessed Mother and Child statue and the Saint Joseph statue in white Carrara marble. They were installed around 1909. Aureli's statue of Saint Frances de Sales (Bishop Chatard's patron saint) was delivered in 1911 and installed on the high altar.

When founded, the Bardstown Diocese included most of Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. The geographical area was large, and today there are 44 dioceses in the area comprising the original diocese.  History  Bishop Flaget The first Catholic immigrants to the area came from Maryland in the year 1785. By 1796 it is estimated that there were 300 Catholic families in Kentucky. Among the early missionaries were Fathers Stephen Badin and Michel Barriere who set out on foot for Kentucky on September 3, 1793, sent by Bishop John Carroll of Baltimore. In April, 1794 Barriere left Bardstown, for New Orleans but Fr. Badin established the home base for his missionary journeys on Pottinger's Creek. For the next 14 years Fr. Badin travelled on foot, horseback and boat between widely scattered Catholic settlements in Kentucky and the Northwest Territory. After the departure of Father Barriêres, for three years Father Badin was the only priest in the whole of Kentucky. In 1797 the Rev. M.J.C. Fournier and, in 1799, the Rev. Anthony Salmon joined Father Badin, but the latter was killed by a fall from a horse nine months after his arrival, and Father Fournier died in 1803. In 1805 he received permanent help with the arrival of Rev. Charles Nerinckx. Tracy, Frank. \\"Kentucky.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 27 June 2019 The Dominicans arrived in Springfield in 1805. The Sisters of Loretto were founded in Marion County in 1812, that same year, Sisters of Charity of Nazareth were founded near Bardstown. A French colony arrived at Louisville in the year 1806 and settled near the Falls of the Ohio, to engage in the milling business, utilizing the falls for power. Their first church was built in 1811; Father Badin was the first pastor, and continued as such until 1817. In 1808, Bardstown became a diocese in its own right, when Benedict Joseph Flaget was appointed by the Holy See as the first Bishop of the newly established Diocese of Bardstown on April 8, 1808. This was the largest diocese ever formed in the United States and comprised an area now covering 10 modern states, including Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana and others. But Flaget opposed the appointment and traveled to France in an effort to have it reversed. He was unsuccessful in this effort.Maes, Camillus. \\"Benedict Joseph Flaget.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 October 2014 On his return trip to the United States, Flaget brought other early Sulpician missionaries to America: Simon Bruté, Guy Ignatius Chabrat, Anthony Deydier, and James Derigaud. The first two also became bishops in America. Upon his arrival, Flaget was consecrated a bishop by now-Archbishop Carroll on November 4, 1810 in a ceremony at the Baltimore Cathedral, now a basilica. So only three years after his appointment did Flaget arrive in Kentucky, and the following year he returned to Baltimore with Fr. Badin to discuss land title and other problems. Upon taking office, Flaget found himself charged with the pastoral care of the western frontier of the United States, having the assistance of seven priests. Saint Thomas Seminary was established in 1811, and Saint Joseph College in Bardstown in 1820. The college was closed during the American Civil War and the building briefly served as a hospital for Union soldiers. Saint Mary College was founded in 1821. Before it was closed in 1976, it was the third oldest Catholic college for boys in the country. The Diocese of Bardstown established its first church, Saint Thomas Parish, within four years of its founding.http://www.lrc.ky.gov/record/08RS/SR246/bill.doc The diocese eventually increased the number of parishes to 23, and the number of priests from six to 36 within the first 25 years of its founding. The cornerstone of historic Basilica of Saint Joseph Proto-Cathedral was laid on July 16, 1816. Many of the paintings and interior decorations were donated by Pope Leo XII, King Louis-Philippe of France and others. The former cathedral of the Diocese of Bardstown, it is now a parish church. Flaget was responsible for a growing network of congregations. John Baptist Mary David (who had been with Flaget in Kentucky since 1810) was ordained a bishop and named Flaget's co-adjutor in 1817, but for two years he tried to refuse the difficult position. He briefly succeeded Flaget in 1832, but he resigned less than a year later, when Flaget was again appointed to head the diocese. In 1841, the Diocese was transferred from Bardstown to Louisville and was renamed the Diocese of Louisville with its Cathedral of the Assumption. Later it was raised to Archdiocese of Louisville. The Diocese of Bardstown, no longer a residential bishopric, is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 846 Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United States in April 2008 celebrated the 200th anniversary of the 1808 creation of the new dioceses and the elevation of Baltimore to an archdiocese.

Lillington has grown from a village which existed before the time of the Domesday Book (1086), and was incorporated into the borough of Leamington in 1890.Royal Leamington Spa, Lyndon F. Cave, Phillimore 1988, p.130. Leamington Lillington is a ward of Warwick District Council, and of Royal Leamington Spa Town Council . Geography Lillington itself has two main areas - the new centre based around Crown Way which contains shops, dry cleaners and a post office. The area was predominantly built as a council house estate from 1950 onwards, and contains three tower blocks. The tallest of these, the fifteen-storey Eden Court, standing at the highest point of the estate, dominates the skyline and can be seen from south Leamington Spa, Radford Semele and for miles outside Leamington.The Buildings of England, Pevsner & Wedgwood, Penguin 1966. p.340. The second, and older area, contains the former village with the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene, the manor house, some Victorian terraced houses as well as estates of predominantly semi-detached houses built since 1930. =Campion Hills= The Campion Hills are the highest area of Leamington, rising to an altitude of 97m above OD. Situated to the north of, and above Newbold Comyn park, they offer a view over the whole town. Sited here is Leamington's transmission tower which relays TV signals from Sutton Coldfield and broadcasts local commercial radio station, Free Coventry & Warwickshire. Its Severn Trent water treatment plant serves the whole Leamington area. Warwick District Council runs a BMX track on the hills. =Bins Brook= The Bins Brook is a mainly culverted watercourse that runs south into Leamington. Just inside Lillington, on the Leamington town centre side adjacent to the Midland Oak, is a fenced area of meadow plants in a man-made depression. This excavated area is normally dry, but fills from the Bins Brook if it overflows during flash floods, to reduce the risk of local flooding to property. =The Midland Oak= The Midland Oak by the junction of Lillington Avenue and Lillington Road marks the supposed very centre of England.The King's England - Warwickshire, Arthur Mee (Editor), p.165, p.9 (photograph) The original oak is thought to have dated form the 16th century. Having died, it was removed in 1967, which allowed the Lillington Road to be straightened. The successor was planted in the 1980s, from an acorn collected from the original. =Pre- historic and early remains= In the 1930s pre-historic elephant and woolly rhinoceros remains were found in sand and gravel pits in Cubbington Road, near the site of the present Lillington Free Church. Some of these are displayed in Warwick Market Hall Museum. Stone Age remains have also been found there. Roman artefacts and burials have been discovered in the area of Highland Road and Braemar Road.Victoria County History of Warwickshire, Volume VI, p. 161. =Lillington Stud Farm= Lillington was once well known as a centre for horse-breeding at the stud farm owned by Sydney McGregor (1889 - 1970). McGregor's best known horse was probably April the Fifth, which won the Epsom Derby in 1932.Royal Leamington Spa Courier, 12 April 1940, p5. The farm buildings and house stood at the end of Epsom Road. After 1970, the area was developed for housing, with many of the new roads having racing-related names. Education The local schools are Lillington Nursery and Primary School, Telford Infant and Telford Junior Schools. The nearest secondary school is North Leamington School. A Sure Start Children’s Centre opened in late 2006, adjacent to the 1950s built community centre, and Lillington Library on Mason Avenue. Churches The Church of England parish church of St. Mary Magdalene in Vicarage Road retains some Saxon work, but was largely rebuilt between 1847 and 1884. The late Perpendicular tower also remains, with a contemporary bell cast around 1480. With two seventeenth-century bells and five more dating from 1927, the present ring of eight bells was formed. They were re-hung by Nicholsons' of Bridport in 2007. The Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady, in Valley Road next to the Public Library, was consecrated in 1963. It has notable stained glass in the 'Dalle de verre' style, created by Dom Charles Norris of Prinknash. Lillington Free Church is on the north side of Cubbington Road, close to The Holt.

It is one of the public holidays in Portugal and celebrated by Portuguese people throughout the world. It commemorates the death on 10 June 1580 of Luís de Camões, a poet and national literary icon. Honoring Camões Camões wrote Os Lusíadas (usually translated as The Lusiads), Portugal's national epic poem celebrating Portuguese history and achievements. The poem focuses mainly on the 15th-century Portuguese explorations, which brought fame and fortune to the country. The poem, considered one of the finest and most important works in Portuguese literature, became a symbol for the great feats of the Portuguese Empire. Camões was an adventurer who lost one eye fighting in Ceuta, wrote the poem while traveling, and survived a shipwreck in Cochinchina (a region of present-day Vietnam). According to popular folklore, Camões saved his epic poem by swimming with one arm while keeping the other arm above water. Since his date of birth is unknown, his date of death is celebrated as Portugal's National Day. Although Camões became a symbol for Portugal nationalism, his death coincided with the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580 that eventually resulted in Philip II of Spain claiming the Portuguese throne. Portugal was then ruled by three generations of Spanish kings during the Iberian Union (1580-1640). On 1 December 1640, the country regained its independence once again by expelling the Spanish during the Portuguese Restoration War and making John of Bragança, King John IV of Portugal. During the authoritarian Estado Novo regime in the 20th century, Camões was used as a symbol for the Portuguese nation. In 1944, at the dedication ceremony of the National Stadium in Oeiras (near Lisbon), Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar referred to 10 June as Dia da Raça (Day of the Portuguese Race). The notion of a Portuguese \\"race\\" served his nationalist purposes. Portugal Day celebrations were officially suspended during the Carnation Revolution in 1974. Celebrations resumed after 1974 and were expanded to include the Comunidades Portuguesas, Portuguese emigrants and their descendants living in communities all around the world. Observances In 2013 the official celebrations took place in the town of Elvas, the second time since 1997. One reason that Elvas had been chosen was that it had been classified in 2012 as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and is one of the most important cities in Portugal at the military level and the most fortified city in Europe. In 2016 for the first time the official ceremonies were divided between the Portuguese capital of Lisbon and the French capital of Paris, by the initiative of president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa as a reminder that it is also the day of the Portuguese communities throughout the world. =In other countriesCanada On 8 November 2017, the House of Commons unanimously passed Davenport M.P. Julie Dzerowicz’s Private Member’s Bill M-126, declaring June as Portuguese Heritage Month and 10 June as Portugal Day in Canada. M-126 recognizes the contributions that Portuguese-Canadians have made to Canada and the importance of educating and reflecting upon Portuguese heritage and culture for future generations. This now opens these occasions to being recognized and celebrated at a national level instead of only by municipalities or provinces. In Toronto, Ontario, over 200,000 Portuguese- Canadians celebrate by holding a multitude of events surrounding the 10 June date. The week-long festival culminates with the Portugal Day Parade on Dundas Street, in the area known as Little Portugal.

His parents divorced and his mother was later married to Joseph Goebbels. After World War II, Quandt and his older half-brother Herbert Quandt ran the industrial empire that was left to them by their father and that continues today, the family owning a stake in Germany's luxury car manufacturer BMW. Early life 10 year old Harald Quandt on the right, at his mother's remarriage with Goebbels and Hitler in the background. Harald Quandt was born in Charlottenburg, the son of industrialist Günther Quandt and Magdalena Behrend Rietschel who had married in 1921. Although the couple divorced in 1929, they remained on friendly terms. Magda later married Joseph Goebbels at a property owned by Günther Quandt. Adolf Hitler was Goebbels' best man. After his mother's remarriage, Quandt remained with his father, who became a prominent business leader in Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, he paid regular visits to his mother, who had become \\"the First Lady of the Third Reich\\", and to his stepfather, who was minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda from 1933. After 1934, he returned to his mother and lived with the Goebbels family until passing his school-leaving examination in 1940. Residing with his adopted family, he raised several eyebrows by supporting the sloganeering of the Indian politician Subhash Chandra Bose. He served as a lieutenant in the Luftwaffe during World War II. He took part in the Battle of Crete in 1941 and later fought in Russia and Italy, where he was injured. In 1944, he was captured by Allied troops in Italy; he was released in 1947. Magda and Joseph Goebbels committed suicide after killing their six children on 1 May 1945. Harald was the only one of Magda's children to survive. Post- war Quandt married Inge Bandekow (1928-1978), who was the daughter of the company's lawyer and worked as a secretary with her father, at the beginning of the 1950s. In the following 17 years, the couple had five daughters: Katarina Geller (1951), Gabriele Quandt-Langenscheidt (1952), Anette May-Thies (1954), Colleen-Bettina Rosenblat-Mo (1962) and Patricia Halterman (1967-2005). However, Quandt had the reputation of being a “committed playboy\\". Business dealings After returning to Germany, he first assisted his half-brother in re-building the family firms, and then from 1949 to 1953 studied mechanical engineering in Hanover and Stuttgart, where his family owned large firms (AFA/VARTA in Hanover, a private equity firm in Stuttgart). His father died in 1954, leaving his empire jointly to Herbert and Harald, and making Harald one of the wealthiest men in West Germany. By then, the Quandt group consisted of more than 200 companies, ranging from the original textile businesses to pharmaceutical company Altana AG. The family holdings also included large stakes in the German auto industry with nearly 10% of Daimler- Benz and 30% of BMW. Although Herbert and Harald jointly managed the companies, Herbert focused on AFA/VARTA and the automotive investments, while Harald was in charge of IWKA and the engineering and tooling companies. Harald was an enthusiast of the amphibious vehicle known as the Amphicar that was manufactured by IWKA. His death was a factor in the ceasing of production of the Amphicar. Death He survived an aviation accident at Zurich International Airport on 12 December 1965, but he was killed when another of his aircraft crashed in Cuneo, Italy, on 22 September 1967. Family inheritance Harald Quandt's five daughters inherited about 1.5 billion Deutsche Mark ($760 million, €585 million) and later increased their wealth through the Harald Quandt Holding GmbH, a German-based family investment company and trust named after their father. Today, they share a fortune worth at least $6 billion.Bloomberg Billionaires Index In popular culture Forced concentration camp labour at U-boat pens in Bremen, 1944 The Hanns-Joachim- Friedrichs-Award winning documentary film The Silence of the Quandts by the German public broadcaster ARD described in October 2007 the role of the Quandt family businesses during the Second World War. The family's Nazi past was previously not well known, and the documentary film revealed it to a wide audience and confronted the Quandts about the use of slave labourers in the family's factories during World War II. As a result, five days after the showing, four family members announced, on behalf of the entire Quandt family, their intention to fund a research project in which a historian will examine the family's activities during Adolf Hitler's dictatorship. The independent 1,200-page study released in 2011 concluded that, \\"The Quandts were linked inseparably with the crimes of the Nazis,\\" according to Joachim Scholtyseck, the historian who compiled and researched the study.

It is situated in the southeastern corner of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The summit plateau reaches a height of .  Geography  View from a point near the summit of Blorenge Blorenge overlooks the market town of Abergavenny and the villages of Llanfoist and Govilon in the Usk Valley to the north. At the foot of the mountain lies the Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal. It drops away steeply to the northwest into Cwm Llanwenarth. To the south, gentler slopes fall away to Blaenavon at the head of the Lwyd valley. Prominent peaks seen from the Blorenge include the Skirrid to the east of Abergavenny and the Sugar Loaf to the north. The high moorland ridge continues to the south of the minor road at Foxhunter car park and assumes the name Mynydd y Garn-fawr. The cairn referenced in the title of this southerly shoulder of Blorenge may be that now known as Carn y Defaid which sits on the county boundary at a height of 503m. It is the most prominent amongst a handful of Bronze Age burial cairns.  Geology  Blorenge is composed in layer-cake fashion of a number of rock types. Its lower slopes are formed from the sandstones and mudstones deposited during the Devonian period and known collectively as the Old Red Sandstone. Its higher reaches are formed from a suite of mudstones, limestones and sandstones of Carboniferous age. The summit plateau is formed from coarse sandstones that lie at the boundary of the Millstone Grit and the Coal Measures. All of these beds tilt south- westwards into the South Wales Coalfield basin. The shape of the hill was modified during the ice ages as the Usk Valley glacier flowed past it to its north. A small glacier nourished by windblown snow from the plateau excavated the hollow on the eastern side of Blorenge which is known as The Punchbowl. Cwm Craf on the hill's north-eastern slopes has a cirque-like form though probably never harboured a full-grown glacier. Small landslips affect Blorenge's slopes, the most well-known of which is the Tumble through which the B4246 climbs towards Keeper's Pond.British Geological Survey 50K Map sheet 232 'Abergavenny' & accompanying memoir Wildfire damage near the top of Blorenge, near Abergavenny, south Wales, in 2010.  Protected areas  Blorenge is situated within both the Brecon Beacons National Park and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape, a World Heritage Site. Much of the hill has also been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest principally for its heather moorland which is important for breeding red grouse. The Punchbowl is owned and managed by the Woodland Trust as a nature reserve.  Access  Most of the hill is open access for walkers and there are a number of footpaths and bridleways which run to and over it. There is a hillwalking trail that runs around Blorenge and is a very popular destination for tourists and walkers alike. The ascent on foot to the summit from Llanfoist / Abergavenny via Cwm Craf is very steep but the effort is repaid by the panoramic views from the summit across the valley of the River Usk to Abergavenny and the Black Mountains, Wales. Easier access both to the summit and the northern edge of the plateau can be had from the Foxhunter car park.  Recreation  Plaque marking the grave of Foxhunter Most visitors are walkers and sightseers. Some come to see the grave of Sir Harry Llewellyn's famous showjumping horse, Foxhunter, who won Britain's only Gold medal in the 1952 Summer Olympics. Foxhunter is buried near to the Blaenavon to Llanover road on Blorenge. A car park here is named in his honour. The SE Wales Hang Gliding & Paragliding Club's members regularly take off from the summit, The whole 998 acres of the upper part is owned by the club. Paragliders performing 'top to bottom' flights land in Castle Meadows beside the River Usk at Abergavenny. Every November a 'category A' fell race takes place on the mountain starting and finishing at St Faith's Church at Llanfoist. The race route passes under the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal. There is also a Great Taste Award winning pale ale named after this hill and produced not far away in Llanhilleth. Industrial heritage The remains of a tramway, built about 1796, linking a limestone quarry on the north side of the mountain with the ironworks at Blaenavon can be seen near . Hill's Tramroad extends around the western flanks of the hill and drops steeply down to Llanfoist by means of a series of inclines beneath Cwm Craf. There are extensive abandoned workings for limestone around the northern and eastern rim of Blorenge and in the vicinity of Foxhunter car park and to its south, abandoned sandstone quarries. Traces of the former practice of hushing for ironstone can be seen near to Keeper's Pond. The Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, formerly the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal, wraps around the foot of Blorenge to the north and east. Etymology It has been suggested that the mountain's name may derive from the Welsh plor ('pimple') and relating to Middle English blure ('blister'), or else from blawr ais ('grey ribbed').Owen, H.W. & Morgan, R. 2007 Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales, Gomer Press, Ceredigion Blorenge in popular culture Blorenge is believed to be a source of inspiration for Cecil Frances Humphreys Alexander's hymn \\"All Things Bright And Beautiful\\". The fourth verse starts \\"The purple headed mountain, the river running by\\". \\"The purple headed mountain\\" is believed to be Blorenge, \\"The river running by\\" the Usk beneath. \\"Blorenge\\" is one of very few words in the English language which is a perfect rhyme for \\"orange.\\" Cycling 'the Tumble' The western edge of Blorenge is crossed by the B4246 road between Llanfoist and Blaenavon which passes over the climb known as \\"The Tumble\\" (\\"Y Tymbol\\"), which reaches an elevation of close to Keepers Pond (Pen-ffordd-goch Pond) (at ). The climb is regularly featured in cycle races, and has hosted the finish of the final stage of the Junior Tour of Wales since 1989. It is listed as one of the 100 Greatest Cycling Climbs in Britain. The signs at the summit indicate incorrectly that the elevation is . From Govilon, the climb is long, gaining in altitude, at an average gradient of 9.0%. Stage 3 of the 2014 Tour of Britain finished at the summit on 9 September 2014, when the stage winner was the Italian rider, Edoardo Zardini.

The novel is set at a fictional computer hardware manufacturing company in the mid-1990s. The plot concerns protagonist Tom Sanders and his struggle to prove that he was sexually harassed by his female employer.  Summary  Tom Sanders, the head of advanced products manufacturing at DigiCom, expects to be promoted to run the advanced products division after DigiCom's merger with a publishing house. Instead, the promotion is given to his ex-girlfriend, Meredith Johnson, who recently moved to Seattle from the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California. Later that day, Meredith calls Tom into her office, ostensibly to discuss an advanced CD-ROM drive. She aggressively tries to resume their relationship, despite Tom's repeated attempts to resist. When he spurns her sexual advances, Meredith angrily vows to make him pay. The next morning, Tom discovers that Meredith has retaliated by falsely accusing him of sexual harassment. DigiCom president Bob Garvin, fearing that the incident could jeopardize the merger, tells the company's general counsel, Phil Blackburn, to propose transferring Tom to the company's Austin facility. However, Tom's division is due to be spun off as a publicly traded company after the merger, and if he's transferred, he will lose stock options which would make him a wealthy man. In addition, Tom's coworkers treat him with animosity, as they have believed Meredith's story. Seemingly out of options, Tom gets in touch with Seattle attorney Louise Fernandez, who agrees to take the case. Tom threatens to sue Meredith and DigiCom for sexual harassment unless Meredith is fired, throwing the merger and his future with the company in jeopardy. During a mediation, Tom discovers that when he called one of his colleagues, John Levin, about the problems with the drive, John's answering machine recorded the whole incident with Meredith. He and Louise also discover that DigiCom officials have known for some time that Meredith has a history of unwelcome advances toward male coworkers, and yet did nothing to stop it. Confronted with this evidence, DigiCom is forced to agree to a settlement in which Meredith is quietly pushed out and Tom is restored to his former post. That night, Tom gets an email from \\"A Friend\\" warning him that all is not normal yet. Later, he overhears Meredith and Phil planning to make it look like Tom is responsible for defects in the CD-ROM project, thereby giving DigiCom an excuse to fire him for incompetence. Tom is initially unable to access the company database to prove his innocence, since Meredith has revoked his authorization. He circumvents the block through a prototype of the company's virtual reality machine that visualizes data. Tom discovers that Meredith changed the quality control specifications at the Malaysian plant manufacturing the drive. These changes, ostensibly to appease Malaysian government demands and cut costs, resulted in the defects. With the help of one of his Malaysian colleagues, Tom obtains enough evidence to turn the tables on Meredith and Phil, resulting in them getting fired instead. However, the merger does not go through, Tom does not receive his promotion and the novel's epilogue states that both Phil and Meredith eventually found much better jobs elsewhere.  Major themes  The primary theme is sexual harassment. According to Crichton, it is based on a true story of a male protagonist who is being sexually harassed by a female executive, reversing the expected gender roles. The book has been referred to as both postfeminist and anti-feminist. Crichton offered a rebuttal at the close of the novel which states that a \\"role-reversal\\" story uncovers aspects of the subject that would not be as easily seen with a female protagonist.  Film adaptation  In 1994, Disclosure, a film adaptation of the novel was released. It starred Demi Moore, Michael Douglas, Donald Sutherland and Dennis Miller. Reviews to the movie were mixed but was a box office hit, as it made over $214 million worldwide. An unofficial Indian remake of the film titled Aitraaz was released in 2004. It starred Akshay Kumar and Priyanka Chopra in Douglas and Moore's roles with Kareena Kapoor as Kumar's wife. The Hindi film was later remade in Kannada as Shrimathi (2011).  Reception  Reviews were mostly favourable. The New York Timess Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said of Disclosure that it is: > an elaborate provocation of rage in which a thousand fragments of revenge > finally fall into place, like acid rain on wildfire. Meanwhile, Mr. Crichton > also irrelevantly entertains us with a complex vision of the digital future, > complete with cellular phones the size of credit cards, CD-ROM players that > can store 600 books and database environments you can virtually walk around > in with the guidance of a helpful angel who cracks wise. In a review comparing the novel with the film adaptation, Nathan Rabin expressed a negative view: he described Disclosure as \\"loathsome\\" and \\"borderline-unreadable\\", and inferior to its film version.Disclosure Nathan Rabin, The Dissolve, August 16, 2013. Retrieved February 15, 2014. Rabin also criticized the novel's characterization: \\"Not since Atlas Shrugged has a novelist strayed so egregiously from plausible human behavior in dogged pursuit of making a muddled ideological point\\".

The theme was made popular by Northern painters such as Jan van Eyck, Hans Memling, and Albrecht Dürer. There are also several versions of the theme attributed to Titian, notably the one in the Hermitage Museum. One painting of the subject, simply titled Salvator Mundi, was attributed or reattributed to Leonardo da Vinci in 2011. This painting disappeared from 1763 until 1900, when it was acquired from Sir Charles Robinson. It was at the time thought to be a work by Leonardo's follower, Bernardino Luini, and was purchased for the Doughty House in Richmond, London by Sir Francis Cook . By this time Christ's face and hair had been extensively repainted. A photograph taken in 1912 records the work's altered appearance. In 2017, this painting sold at auction for US$450,300,000, the highest price ever paid for a painting.

S. Lowry, gaining some popularity since his death. He is alleged to be the illegitimate son of comedian Frank Randle (born Arthur Hughes). His mother, Genevieve Delaney (also known as Willis (born Kelshaw)) was a music hall artiste who appeared with her sister, Mary Monica Kelshaw (also known as Lee); their act was known as Delaney and Lee. At 13 years of age, he joined a textile design studio in Manchester where he worked for the next 32 years. He married his childhood sweetheart, Joan Campion, in 1949 and they had four children. He started to paint as a means of relaxation. There were two great influences in his life that were to effect his own development as a painter. One was the work of L. S. Lowry and the other was the memories of the happy years he spent as a boy in the Manchester of the 1930s with its smoke-laden skies, rattling tramcars and gas lamps. Lowry's work made him aware of the many special qualities of the north and soon he began producing street scenes and industrial landscapes. His paintings were not stylised but a true likeness to their location. He set out to capture the atmosphere of the 1930s and all of his paintings capture the nostalgia of the period. In April 1974 he held a very successful one-man show at the Tib Lane Gallery in Manchester, with all the pictures selling within half an hour at the preview. His paintings continued to sell well during his lifetime and he exhibited at the Royal Academy. Many of his paintings were produced as limited-edition prints. In 2010 a painting by Delaney, in the style of L.S. Lowry, and painted as a homage to him, was auctioned after being seized by police from convicted fraudster Maurice Taylor. Taylor had purchased the painting for £7,500 in 2004; a signature \\"L S Lowry, 1964\\" had been added, before the painting was sold for £330,000 to a specialist dealer in Lowrys. The painting, of a snowbound Mill Street, Manchester, had been given an insurance valuation of £600,000 by the auctioneers Bonhams. The painting was said to lack fluidity, with muddy skies and with the lamp-posts wrongly highlighted in red.

It is owned by the oil and gas industry contractor Saipem S.p.A. Construction The vessel was designed by Gusto Engineering during 1984. The vessel was built between 1985 and 1987 by Fincantieri- Cantieri Navali Italiana S.p.A. at their Monfalcone yard, Trieste in north- eastern Italy. The vessel was built in two halves in a long dry dock. The halves were then floated out from the dry dock and mated. During the mating operation the halves were supported by temporary pontoons. The hull mating was complete in early 1987 and the two cranes built by Officine Meccaniche Reggiane under subcontract to American Hoist & Derrick Company (Amhoist) were installed in sections by the Saipem crane vessel Castoro Otto in April of that year. The sea trials, which took two months, started in September, and on 15 December the vessel was handed over to Micoperi. The cost of the vessel was not released by Micoperi but it was estimated in the technical press as being up to US$400 million. DescriptionConcept= The Saipem 7000, originally named the Micoperi 7000, was conceived in the mid-1980s by its original owners Micoperi as a multipurpose offshore oil platform installation vessel that would be able to install very large oil production platform decks (known as integrated decks) as well as the decks' supporting structures (known as jackets) using its two very large fully revolving cranes. It would also be able to support the offshore completion of the platform by providing hotel and workshop facilities for large construction crews. Saturation diving facilities would support subsea connection work. The vessel's size and semi-submersible form would allow it to operate in worse weather conditions than smaller and conventionally shaped vessels. The huge cost of a vessel of this size would be offset by the cost and time savings made by the oil company as the large integrated decks could be completed, tested and commissioned onshore. Prior to the introduction of the large crane vessels, offshore oil platforms were made up of 1000 - 2000 tonne modules which were lifted into place individually by smaller SSCVs or monohull crane vessels and then connected together offshore, tested and then commissioned; this often took over a year. Other savings in the installation of the jackets could also be made. =Original specificationHeavy lift The Saipem 7000 has two NOV Lifting and Handling AmClyde model Saipem 7000 fully revolving cranes. Each has a 140-metre-long boom fitted with 4 hooks. Each crane is capable of lifting up to 7,000 tonnes at 40 m lift radius using the main hook. The auxiliary hook capacities are 1st Auxiliary 2,500 tonnes at 75 m radius and 2nd Auxiliary 900 tonnes at 115 m. The whip hook has a capacity of 120 tonnes at 150 m. The 2nd Auxiliary hook can be deployed to a water depth of 450 m. The two cranes are capable of a tandem lift of 14,000 tonnes. Each crane was fitted with engines to power the boom and load hoists, 9 tugger lines and the crane slewing system. The cranes use of wire rope of various diameters. Ballast system The Saipem 7000 was fitted with two ballast systems: a conventional pumped system which could transfer up to 24,000 tonnes of water per hour using 4 pumps and a free flooding system. The free flooding system used 2 m diameter valves to open certain compartments to the sea thus trimming or heeling the vessel. This allows the vessel to lift cargoes from barges much faster than if just the crane hoists are used. Power system The vessel's main power is provided by eight 12-cylinder 8400 hp diesel engines built by Grandi Motori Trieste, a former Fincantieri company. Later Grandi Motori was purchased by the Finnish Wärtsilä. They provide up to 47,000 kW of electric power at 10,000 V 60 Hz for propulsion and positioning. Auxiliary power is provided by two 6-cylinder GMT diesel engines. There is also an emergency generator. Total power that can be supplied is . Mooring system The vessel was supplied with 16 anchor lines, 4 at each corner. Each line consists of 3350 m of 96 mm wire rope, 50 m of 92 mm chain and a 40-tonne Norshore Mark 3 anchor. Each line has its own single drum winch. The mooring system can be used in water depths of up to 450 m. The Saipem 7000 is also equipped with two anchor windlasses equipped with 550m of 130mm chain and 35 tonne anchor. Thrusters The vessel was fitted with 12 thrusters—6 on each hull. They are, per hull: *1 No. bow thrusters in athwartship tunnels *2 No. azimuthing retractable thrusters under the hull *2 No. azimuthing thrusters at the stern—these are used when transiting *1 No. azimuthing retractable thrusters under the hull (added during 1999 refit) Dynamic positioning system The vessel is equipped with a dynamic positioning system which uses either the thrusters or the mooring system or a combination of both, controlled by a number of computers, to hold the vessel in a predefined location.

The accommodation also contains a large galley and mess rooms, a hospital, cinema and lounges. =1999 vessel re-fit= During the winter of 1999/2000 the Saipem 7000 underwent a refit to enhance its positioning and power systems and add a J-lay system. The power system was upgraded to provide up to 70,000 kW using 12 diesel generators. To improve the vessel's resilience the generators are distributed between four separate engine rooms. Two 5,500 kW retractable azimuthing thrusters were added, one below the forward part of each hull. The DP system control computers were also replaced. The hull, deck and deck structures were modified to accept the Gusto designed J-lay tower and its support equipment. The J-lay tower can lay pipe from 4\\" to 32\\" diameter with a tension of up to 525 tonnes (5.15 MN) using the tensioners and up to 2,000 tonnes (20 MN) when using friction clamps. The deck can used to store up to 10,000 tonnes of pipe. To allow space for the increased equipment some items from the original specification were removed, including 2 anchor winches from the bow, all the moon pools, and the boilers used to provide steam for the steam hammers. OperationsEarly projects= The vessel's first work was for Petrobras the Brazilian state oil company. The project consisted of the installation of 7 platforms in the Campos Basin. During this project the Micoperi 7000 was also involved in the fighting of a well fire on the Enchova Platform. The Micoperi 7000 then proceeded to the Gulf of Mexico where it installed the Jolliet Template for Conoco. In 1989 the Micoperi 7000 arrived in the North Sea for the first time where it completed several projects in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. These were the Gyda Platform for BP, the Togi Template for Norsk Hydro and the Veslefrikk platform for Statoil. In 1990 and 1991, the Micoperi was used in the construction and assembly of the Mossgas FA platform off the south coast of South Africa near a town called Mossel Bay. Whilst the vessel remained busy, Micoperi were struggling financially as the low oil price prevalent in the late 1980s curtailed oil company investment. In 1991 Micoperi were forced to sell a number of their major assets including the Micoperi 7000 to another Italian contractor Saipem. Saipem took over the running of the vessel though they retained the vessel crew and the shorebased engineering support. Saipem renamed the vessel the Saipem 7000. The vessel continued to work, installing oil and gas production platforms, in the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, off the Canadian east coast and the west coast of Africa throughout the nineties. It was also involved in the removal of one platform, the Esso Odin. During the late nineties Saipem planned an upgrade to the vessels DP system and installation of a J-Lay system. =Projects= The Saipem 7000 has completed 4 J-Lay pipe projects Diana, Blue Stream, Ormen Lange and Medgaz, but its main work continues to be heavy lift in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes both platform installation and removal and the addition of modules to existing platforms. =Lifting and pipelaying records= The Saipem 7000 set the world offshore lifting record of 12,150 tons for the Sabratha deck in the Mediterranean Sea. A local record for the Gulf of Mexico (Mexican area) was set with the 10,473 tons of the PB-KU-A2 deck. In July 2010, the Saipem 7000 broke another world record by lifting the new BP Valhall Production and Hotel topside of approximately 11,600 tonnes on Dynamic Positioning. The previous world record set at Sabratha was performed on the vessel's anchoring system. The first and third records were broken on 7 September 2019 when the Sleipnir lifted the 15,300 ton deck module for Noble's Leviathan.'Heerema’s crane vessel Sleipnir in record-breaking Leviathan lift' in Offshore Energy Today The Saipem 7000 laid the 24\\" pipeline for the Blue Stream project between Russia and Turkey up to the record depth of 2,150 meters in the Black Sea. This was broken at the end of 2005 by the Balder which laid a pipeline in 2,200 meters of water, yet Balder was outbeat herself in 2014 by another laybarge of Saipem, the FDS2, which laid another 24\\" pipeline in 2,250 meters offshore Brazil.

Moving Day () is a tradition, but not a legal requirement, in the province of Quebec, Canada, dating from the time when the province used to mandate fixed terms for leases of rental properties. It falls on July 1, which is also Canada Day. History Moving Day in Montreal, as depicted by Henri Julien, 1876 The tradition began as a humanitarian measure of the French colonial government of New France, who forbade seigneurs, the semi-feudal landlords of the seigneuries, from evicting their tenant farmers before the winter snows had melted.. Historian Yvon Desloges notes that it was common to move in the spring in the 18th century, citing a 1750 bylaw by Intendant François Bigot. Additionally, Jean-Philippe Warren, a sociologist at Concordia University in Montreal, noted in a 2013 interview for The New York Times that French law in the 18th century set May 1 as the starting date for all legal agreements, including leases. Later, this evolved into a requirement that urban leases begin on May 1 and end on April 30. In law, this date was set in the Civil Code of Lower Canada of 1866. May 1 thus became \\"Moving Day\\", the day during which renters who wished to vacate their current premises physically changed domiciles. In 1973, the Quebec government decided that it would be better to move Moving Day to the summer. This measure would allow children, especially the ones in primary school to complete their full year at the same establishment.The Gazette (June 26th,1905)https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Gbw0AAAAIBAJ&sjid;=7IQFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3337,6532608&dq;=moving- day+may+1st&hl;=en Also, by moving the date to a holiday, workers would not have to sacrifice a working day. It has been noted that Quebec separtists saw this as a way to reduce celebrations of what was then called Dominion Day and is now Canada Day.Mark Steyn https://www.steynonline.com/10255/sequesterd-days This argument was strong for the tenants rights groups representing the average poorer class.Heffez, Alanah (Fall,2012). 260 years of Moving Day. Spacing Magazine, p.12 Moreover, they moved the date from May 1st to July 1 because of the tendency for rough weather in early May.The Gazette (May, 2nd 1935)https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hpMuAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=FpkFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6714,195313&dq;=moving- day+july-1&hl;=en The law repealed sections of the Civil code setting fixed terms for leases as of 1974, but mandated a two-month lengthening of leases for following year as a transitory measure. However, tradition has held sway, and the vast majority of leases are still a year long and begin around July 1. In 2004, approximately 120,000 households moved on or around July 1, corresponding to 4% of the population. In 2013, the government of Montreal estimated that about 115,000 city residents moved each year, or about 7% of the city's 1.6 million people. In the aforementioned interview, Warren added sociological reasons why July 1 has persisted as Moving Day. He noted that Francophone Quebecers move much more frequently than other Canadians, but generally stay in their old neighbourhoods, with some moving only across the street. According to Warren, a higher frequency of moves in the Francophone community makes a standard moving date more convenient for people changing their residences. As he put it, \\"They are constantly on the move, but they don’t go anywhere.\\" Impact Narrow and curved staircases add to the challenge of moving. Moving Day is a boon and a headache for commercial moving companies, and people must reserve their services in advance, more than six months before moving day in some cases. During this period, moving companies work around the clock, with moving charges often being three times the normal rate. The short supply of movers in Montreal inspired entrepreneurs to offer a green moving service featuring heavy-duty bicycle trailers.Moving in Tel Aviv In Montreal, where only 55.7% of residents own their home (the lowest rate of the major Canadian cities), Moving Day is particularly busy and has been described as \\"a kind of moving madness\\". Exterior staircases leading up to second, third, or even fourth-storey apartments are common in many neighbourhoods, in part because historically this reduced the size of buildings and therefore decreased the owner's property taxes. These staircases are often narrow, curved, and metal - not ideal for nonprofessionals carrying major appliances. According to New York Times writer Ian Austen, \\"unlike apartments in the rest of Canada, the ones here [in Montreal] rarely come with kitchen appliances, adding to the movers' burdens.\\" Cities also schedule extra garbage and recycling pickups for this period to deal with unwanted furniture and empty boxes left beside the road. According to Hydro-Québec, more than 700,000 Quebec households moved in 2009, including 225,000 on the island of Montreal. The July 1 date of Moving Day also somewhat reduces the significance of Canada Day as a public holiday in Quebec, as many who might otherwise attend holiday festivities are occupied by moving. Suggestions that the move was a deliberate decision by Quebec sovereigntists to discourage participation in a patriotic Canadian holiday ignore the fact that the change in date from May 1 to July 1 was the result of a bill introduced by a federalist MNA, Jérôme Choquette of the Quebec Liberal Party. Although moving day is seen as a headache for most people, Montreal-based columnist Josée Legault sees a few positive aspects in the annual festival, pointing out that July 1 occurs at the end of the school year, not two months before as was the case before the 1970s. Bargain hunters —especially people who don't move— also enjoy the numerous garage sales occurring before moving day and the common practice of leaving behind slightly used furniture and appliances on the curb side or in the alley, in effect giving them to anyone in need. The annual ritual has also been translated in Quebec's literature, music and cinema. Gabrielle Roy's classic novel Bonheur d'occasion describes the traditional frenzy surrounding Moving Day in the working-class borough of Saint-Henri in Montreal. Quebec film director Philippe Gagnon used the yearly occurrence as the setting for ', a 2004 light-hearted comedy featuring three households caught in the turmoil of Moving Day.

Borrowers with high cost mortgages whose mortgages entered or are entering into foreclosure from September 2008 on, will be required to attend a mandatory settlement conference prior to foreclosure proceedings. High cost loans are considered to have excessive fees, risk-based sub-prime percentage rates, negative amortizing payment options, and other features which may or may not be considered predatory lending practices. On December 15, 2009, Governor David Paterson signed into law an expanded version of the mandatory settlement conference legislation. Section 3408 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of New York now provides that the court shall hold a mandatory settlement conference for all loans for one to four family homes within sixty days following the date proof of service is filed with the county clerk. The new law also provides that both the defendant homeowner and the plaintiff lender negotiate in good faith during their mandated settlement conference. The plaintiff lender is required to have a representative or attorney appear at the settlement conference with the authority to fully negotiate and settle the matter.http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1724&context;=plr The foreclosure proceedings are effectively stopped until the referee or judicial hearing officer (JHO) in the settlement conference determines that the settlement conferences are concluded, either because the parties have successfully modified the home loan or obtained some other foreclosure alternative or the referee has determined that one of the parties has not satisfied its requirements under the law. Settlement conferences do not produce formal dispositions but may facilitate loan modifications and stop foreclosure.

It is a white, glassy solid with the formula B2O3. It is almost always found as the vitreous (amorphous) form; however, it can be crystallized after extensive annealing (that is, under prolonged heat). Glassy boron oxide (g-B2O3) is thought to be composed of boroxol rings which are six-membered rings composed of alternating 3-coordinate boron and 2-coordinate oxygen. Because of the difficulty of building disordered models at the correct density with many boroxol rings, this view was initially controversial, but such models have recently been constructed and exhibit properties in excellent agreement with experiment.; It is now recognized, from experimental and theoretical studies, that the fraction of boron atoms belonging to boroxol rings in glassy B2O3 is somewhere between 0.73 and 0.83, with 0.75 () corresponding to a 1:1 ratio between ring and non-ring units. The number of boroxol rings decays in the liquid state with increasing temperature. The crystalline form (α-B2O3) (see structure in the infobox) is exclusively composed of BO3 triangles. This trigonal, quartz-like network undergoes a coesite-like transformation to monoclinic β-B2O3 at several gigapascals (9.5 GPa). Preparation Boron trioxide is produced by treating borax with sulfuric acid in a fusion furnace. At temperatures above 750 °C, the molten boron oxide layer separates out from sodium sulfate. It is then decanted, cooled and obtained in 96–97% purity. Another method is heating boric acid above ~300 °C. Boric acid will initially decompose into steam, (H2O(g)) and metaboric acid (HBO2) at around 170 °C, and further heating above 300 °C will produce more steam and diboron trioxide. The reactions are: :H3BO3 → HBO2 \\\\+ H2O :2 HBO2 → B2O3 \\\\+ H2O Boric acid goes to anhydrous microcrystalline B2O3 in a heated fluidized bed. Carefully controlled heating rate avoids gumming as water evolves. Molten boron oxide attacks silicates. Internally graphitized tubes via acetylene thermal decomposition are passivated. Crystallization of molten α-B2O3 at ambient pressure is strongly kinetically disfavored (compare liquid and crystal densities). Threshold conditions for crystallization of the amorphous solid are 10 kbar and ~200 °C. Its proposed crystal structure in enantiomorphic space groups P31(#144); P32(#145) (e.g., γ-glycine) has been revised to enantiomorphic space groups P3121(#152); P3221(#154)(e.g., α-quartz). Boron oxide will also form when diborane (B2H6) reacts with oxygen in the air or trace amounts of moisture: :2B2H6(g) + 3O2(g) → 2B2O3(s) + 6H2(g) :B2H6(g) + 3H2O(g) → B2O3(s) + 6H2(g) Applications *Fluxing agent for glass and enamels *Starting material for synthesizing other boron compounds such as boron carbide *An additive used in glass fibres (optical fibres) *Component used in the production of borosilicate glass *The inert capping layer in the Liquid Encapsulation Czochralski process for the production of gallium arsenide single crystal *As an acid catalyst in organic synthesis See also *boron suboxide *boric acid *sassolite *Tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) borate ReferencesExternal links *National Pollutant Inventory: Boron and compounds *Australian Government information *US NIH hazard information.

He was also known as Bill Krafsur. Biography Krafsur was mentioned in the Venona intercepts under the codename IDE. He was used by the NKVD during the war as a source of information and for recruiting journalists as informants and agents, and is referred to in the NSA archives as a \\"KGB agent\\" . In the 1930s Krafsur joined the Communist Party of America. He attended Northeastern University for a year. He lived at 68 Phillips Street in Boston before going to Spain to fight with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War, where he was wounded in 1937. In 1938 Krafsur was a member of the editorial staff of \\"The Volunteers for Liberty\\" a newspaper which was an, \\"organ of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade\\" organization out of 125 West 45 Street in New York City. In April 1938 he was in charge of finding veterans to tell their war stories to be made into radio plays written by Irwin Shaw. He began working for TASS in 1941 after being recruited by the Soviet agent Vladimir Pravdin. He became the assistant to the manager Laurence Todd at the Washington sub-bureau.The Two Faces of TASS, Theodore Eduard Kruglak, page 99. Krafsur was considered an important asset to the NKVD because of the many contacts he had with other newsmen. He was the deputy TASS bureau chief in Washington, D.C. and the FBI spent a lot of time and effort trying to identify who he was under his codename IDE. In May 1944, he was described in a NKVD cable from New York to Moscow as, \\"absolutely devoted to the USSR.\\" He provided at least twenty leads of people for possible recruitment including Joseph Berger, a personal aide to the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and I. F. Stone. In 1949, Laurence Todd was relieved of his managing duties and instead given the title of senior correspondent. In this same year Krafsur left TASS and was later called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities where he chose not to cooperate. Later he worked in a toy store. In the early 1960s he married the ex-wife of the secretary-treasurer of the Mine, Mill, and Smelters Union.

It is known for its access to the Thomsen River, one of the most northerly navigable rivers in North America. The park is a fly-in park, and protects approximately of Arctic Lowlands at the northern end of the island. The most practical way to visit the park is to charter a plane, and currently the park has four landing sites. Aulavik is considered a polar desert and often experiences high winds. Precipitation for the park is approximately per year. In the southern regions of the park a sparsely vegetated upland plateau reaches a height of above sea level. The park has the highest concentration of muskoxen on earth, with estimates of 68,000 to 80,000 animals on the island, approximately 20% of which are thought to reside in the park. It is also home to the endangered Peary caribou as well as the more common barren-ground caribou. Ptarmigan and ravens are considered the only year-round birds in the park, although 43 different species make seasonal use of the area. The park is completely treeless. Arctic foxes, brown and northern collared lemmings, Arctic hares and wolves roam the rugged terrain. Marine mammals along the north coast include polar bears, ringed seals, bearded seals, beluga whales and bowhead whales. Birds of prey in the park include snowy owls, rough-legged hawks, gyrfalcons, and peregrine falcons, who feed on the lemmings. Prior to the arrival of the Thule culture in southern Banks Island there were some Pre-Dorset culture people living in what is now the Aulavik National Park. Due to the cooling climate brought on by the Little Ice Age Banks Island was most likely deserted until the arrival of the Inuvialuit in the 17th century. Aulavik National Park has two major bays, Castel Bay and Mercy Bay, and lies south of the McClure Strait. Captain Robert McClure, spent two winters in Mercy Bay on HMS Investigator, while searching for the missing John Franklin's lost expedition between 1850 and 1853. McClure's team abandoned their ship in Mercy Bay and hiked across the sea-ice of the strait to board another ship, HMS Resolute. Nangmagvik Lake is located within this national park. The Mercy Bay area was visited by the Copper Inuit of Victoria Island to salvage materials left by McClure's party. They also hunted the caribou and muskox in the area as evidenced by the large number of food caches. In the 20th century the area was popular with Inuvialuit due to the large numbers of foxes. Until the fur trade went into decline, fox trapping provided a source of income for people from as far away as the Mackenzie Delta and the North Slope of Alaska. This influx of people led to the establishment of Sachs Harbour, the only community on the island.

Stern on the Mad Libs series. Price and Stern became partners with Larry Sloan in the publishing firm Price Stern Sloan.  Biography  Price was born in Charleston, West Virginia, and grew up in the mining town of Widen, West Virginia. He graduated from Greenbrier Military School in 1934, then attended the University of Michigan (1934–1936) and the American Academy of Art in Chicago (1936–1938). During the 1940s, he wrote for The Bob Hope Show and worked with Hope on a newspaper humor column. On Broadway he performed in Arthur Klein's musical revue Tickets, Please! (1950), and he contributed sketch material to Leonard Sillman's New Faces of 1952. Price hosted the television panel show How To (1951), and he was a panelist on other game shows of the early 1950s: Who's There? What Happened? That Reminds Me, The Name's the Same and What's My Line? =Droodles= 250px In 1953, Price invented Droodles, a syndicated feature which he described as \\"a borkley-looking sort of drawing that doesn't make any sense until you know the correct title.\\" When Simon & Schuster published Price's Droodles in 1953, the book launched a Droodle craze that was fueled by a series of ads in college newspapers offering cash prizes for Droodles created by college students. In 1954, Price hosted a Droodles television game show with panelists Marc Connelly, Denise Lor and Carl Reiner. More Droodles were gathered in follow-up books, The Rich Sardine (1954) and Oodles of Droodles (1955). Over the years, many of the drawings (minus the author's droll commentary) have been reprinted in collections such as Classic Droodles. One of Price's original Droodles serves as the cover art for Frank Zappa's 1982 album Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch. Price's other captions for that drawing include \\"Mother pyramid feeding her baby.\\" In 2000, after Stern and Sloan launched another publishing company, Tallfellow Press, they acquired the rights to Droodles and reissued it as Droodles: The Classic Collection. =Price and Harvey Kurtzman= Price had four articles in Harvey Kurtzman's Mad in 1955–1956Gilford, Doug. \\"Mad Magazine Contributors: Roger Price,\\" Doug Gilford's May Cover Site.

The title came about when the two were in Sardi's and overheard an actor arguing with his agent. The actor wanted to \\"ad-lib\\" an interview, but his agent thought such an approach was \\"mad\\". According to Stern, the concept was hatched accidentally.Stern, Leonard, Holly Gressley and Annemieke Beemster Leverenz. \\"50 Years of Filling in the Blanks\\", The New York Times (August 15, 2008). Stern was scripting an episode for The Honeymooners in 1953 when Price came by. Stern recalled, \\"I was trying to find the right word to describe the nose of Ralph Kramden's new boss. So I asked Roger for an idea for an adjective and before I could tell him what it was describing, he threw out 'clumsy' and 'naked'. We both started laughing. We sat down and wrote a bunch of stories with blanks in them. That night we took them to a cocktail party and they were a great success ... We were turned down by every publisher in the New York area. Publishers told us it wasn't a book and suggested we approach game manufacturers, but they also rejected us and advised us to talk to publishers.

He had two children with his second wife, Bettina Lerfield. At the time of his death in 1990, Price lived in Studio City, California. Books In One Head and Out the Other (Ballantine, 1951), which popularized the catchphrase \\"I had one grunch, but the eggplant over there.\\" The nonsense non sequitur was immediately adopted by science fiction fandom, appearing occasionally in science fiction fanzines, as noted in Fancyclopedia II (1959). Using the 18th-century historian Edward Gibbon's book The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire as a comparison to America's upheaval in the 60's, this satirical book compares Roman decline to America's woes. In Price's In One Head and Out the Other, the \\"bible of Avoidism\\", his character Clayton Slope \\"had a clever trick of saying any conceivable sentence so that it sounded like 'I had one grunch but the eggplant over there.' Fans find the expression useful, too ... \\"Avoidism: Not originally fannish at all, but a philosophy devised in a rather stomach- turning book, In One Head and Out the Other, this doctrine became confused/associated with the Gandhi-following folk of Eric Frank Russell's \\"And Then There Were None.\\"Russell, Eric Frank. \\"And Then There Were None,\\" Astounding Science Fiction, vol. XLVII, no.4 (June 1951). It inspired an APA, MYOB and an Avoidist Movement which avoided amounting to anything. Tenets are those implied by the root word. Lee Hoffman explains that three types of avoidism are distinguished: # pure # applied # active (or Activist) In pure avoiding, one avoids everything except eating, breathing and metabolizing. In applied avoiding, one avoids as many things as possible. (Bus drivers are good at this sort of thing, like avoiding people waiting at bus stops.) Active avoidism isn't true avoidism and is practiced to Publicize the Cause, or as an exercise in Avoiding. Under active avoidism there is the subgroup Counteravoiding; to counteravoid vegetarianism, for instance, one eats meat. Leeh concluded: \\"A last word on Avoidism: I had one grunch but the eggplant over there.\\"Eney, Dick. Fancyclopedia II. Bladensburg, Maryland: Operation Crifanac, 1959. An annoying Price dissident in In One Head and Out the Other who crops up from time to time to object forlornly to Avoidist doctrine in many of its guises is one Dr. Carl Gassoway, whom Price promptly and heartlessly dismisses every time as a troublemaker; a refreshing Price ingénue who similarly appears and reappears is Miss Patricia Delray. In a key chapter, Price advised mothers to encourage their offspring to adopt Avoidist habits and responses to the tribulations of real life is to have them read, as a nightly bedtime story, his adaptation of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf (which he first wanted to use in its original form until the composer demanded too many rubles' royalty), namely Milton and the Rhinoceros, in which the latter triumphs by overcoming and eating the former, whose final blunder was to mistake the FIERCE RHINOCEROS!!

History Tigard Elementary School District 23 was established in 1875, while the Tualatin district was started as the Bridgeport district (26J). These districts later merged, as did the Tigard high school district (2J) and the Tualatin high school district (26J). From its inception until 1992, the district operated only one \\"senior\\" high school, Tigard High, which covered grades 10-12. Fowler and Twality Junior High Schools covered grades 7-9. In 1992, a second high school, Tualatin High, was opened, and the district took the opportunity to switch to a middle school system in which the two high schools would cover grades 9-12, the existing junior high schools changed to middle schools covering grades 6-8, and the elementary schools covered grades K-5. A third middle school, Hazelbrook, was also added in 1992. When Tualatin High opened, new school attendance boundaries were drawn; most students at Twality would attend Tualatin High and most students at Fowler would attend Tigard High. Students living in certain areas were given the option of attending either high school. Demographics In the 2009 school year, the district had 170 students classified as homeless by the Department of Education, or 1.3% of students in the district.

This form of ischemic optic neuropathy is generally categorized as two types: arteritic AION (or AAION), in which the loss of vision is the result of an inflammatory disease of arteries in the head called temporal arteritis, and non-arteritic AION (abbreviated as NAION, or sometimes simply as AION), which is due to non-inflammatory disease of small blood vessels. Symptoms NAION typically presents suddenly upon awakening. The afflicted person notes seeing poorly in one eye. Vision in that eye is obscured by a dark shadow, often involving just the upper or lower half of vision, usually the area closer to the nose. There is no pain. Within approximately six months following the infarct, visual acuity improves by three or more lines of vision on the Snellen Chart (the chart with smaller letters on each lower line) in 42.7% of patients, while in 12.4% of patients, vision worsens by three lines. Opposite eye involvement occurs in approximately 15% to 20% of patients with NAION within 5 years.IONDT(The Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial) Study It is not always devastating as visual acuity may remain only moderately impaired. Furthermore, most cases of NAION involve the loss of a hemifield (either the upper or lower half of the visual field, but not both). A few cases of NAION involve near- total loss of vision. Risk factors The mechanism of injury for NAION used to be quite controversial. However, experts in the field have come to a consensus that most cases involve two main risk factors. The first is a predisposition in the form of a type of optic disc shape. The optic disc is where the axons from the retinal ganglion cells collect into the optic nerve. The optic nerve is the bundle of axons that carry the visual signals from the eye to the brain. This optic nerve must penetrate through the wall of the eye, and the hole to accommodate this is usually 20-30% larger than the nerve diameter. In some patients the optic nerve is nearly as large as the opening in the back of the eye, and the optic disc appears \\"crowded\\" when seen by ophthalmoscopy. A crowded disc is also referred to as a \\"disc at risk\\". While a risk factor, the vast majority of individuals with crowded discs do not experience NAION. The second major risk factor involves more general cardiovascular risk factors. The most common are diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol levels. While these factors predispose a patient to develop NAION, the most common precipitating factor is marked fall of blood pressure during sleep (nocturnal arterial hypotension)- that is why at least 75% of the patients first discover visual loss first on waking from sleep. These vascular risk factors lead to ischemia (poor blood supply) to a portion of the optic disc. The disc then swells, and in a crowded optic disc, this leads to compression and more ischemia. Since both eyes tend to have a similar shape, the optometrist or ophthalmologist will look at the good eye to assess the anatomical predisposition. The unaffected eye has a 14.7% risk of NAION within five years. A number of uncontrolled single case or small number of patient reports have associated NAION with use of oral erectile dysfunction drugs. Diagnosis Since arteritic AION is similar in presentation to non-arteritic AION, patients over the age of 50 diagnosed with NAION must be evaluated to exclude AAION (symptoms: painful jaw muscle spasms, scalp tenderness, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, myalgias and loss of appetite); NAION patients over the age of 75 should always be tested. The distinction between AAION and non-arteritic AION was made to highlight the different etiologies of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. AAION is due to temporal arteritis (also called giant-cell arteritis), an inflammatory disease of medium-sized blood vessels (Chapel-Hill-Conference) that occurs especially with advancing age. In contrast, NAION results from the coincidence of cardiovascular risk factors in a patient with \\"crowded\\" optic discs. Non-arteritic AION is more common than AAION and usually occurs in slightly younger persons. While only a few cases of NAION result in near total loss of vision, most cases of AAION result in nearly complete vision loss. Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is an isolated white-matter stroke of the optic nerve (ON). NAION is the most common cause of sudden optic nerve-related vision loss, affecting more than 10,000 Americans every year, often bilaterally. No clinically effective treatments exist, largely because little is known about its pathophysiology, and there are few histopathological studies of the acute condition. An exhaustive review article published in March 2009 described the latest information on arteritic and non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, both anterior (A-AION and NA-AION) and posterior (A-PION, NA-PION, and surgical). Treatment Once NAION happens, it was thought that there was no accepted treatment to reverse the damage. However, a recent uncontrolled retrospective large study has shown that if patients are treated with large doses of corticosteroid therapy during the early stages of NAION, in eyes with initial visual acuity of 20/70 or worse, seen within 2 weeks of onset, there was visual acuity improvement in 70% in the treated group compared to 41% in the untreated group (odds ratio of improvement: 3.39; 95% CI:1.62, 7.11; p ¼ 0.001). That study and a natural history study on NAION (Ophthalmology 2008;115: 298–305.) showed that visual acuity can improve up to 6 months and not after that. To minimize the risk of further visual loss in the fellow eye or the same eye, it is essential to reduce the risk factors. Common sense dictates trying to control the cardiovascular risk factors for many reasons, including protection from this happening to the second eye. Sudden vision loss should lead to an ophthalmological consultation. If NAION is suspected, then ideally a neuro-ophthalmologist's consultation should be obtained. A recent Cochrane Review sought to determine the extent of safety and efficacy of optic nerve decompression surgery for NAION, compared to other treatments, or no treatment. The one study included in the review found no improvements in visual acuity among patients who underwent surgery for NAION, and adverse events (pain, double vision) experienced by participants who underwent surgery. There is much research currently underway looking at ways to protect the nerve (neuroprotection) or even regenerate new fibers within the optic nerve. So far there is no evidence in human studies that the so-called neuroprotectors have any beneficial effect in NAION. However, there is a new current clinical trial for the treatment of NAION in the United States with plans to include sites in India, Israel, Germany and Australia (see NORDICclinicaltrials.com and https://clinicaltrials.gov/). This trial will test the use of a synthetic siRNA that blocks caspase 2, an important enzyme in the apoptosis cycle. In addition to such research, patents have been applied for by Pfizer, The University of Southern California, Otsuka Pharmaceutical and other individual inventors for innovations related to the treatment of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.Patents related to treatment of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy Incidence It is estimated that the incidence of AION in the US is about 8,000 persons per year.

The choice of the three solo instruments effectively makes this a concerto for piano trio, and it is the only concerto Beethoven ever completed for more than one solo instrument. A typical performance takes approximately thirty-seven minutes. Beethoven's early biographer Anton Schindler claimed that the Triple Concerto was written for Beethoven's royal pupil, the Archduke Rudolf of Austria.Steinberg, Michael (1996), The Concerto: A Listener's Guide, Oxford University Press, p. 76. The Archduke, who became an accomplished pianist and composer under Beethoven's tutelage, was only in his mid-teens at this time, and it seems plausible that Beethoven's strategy was to create a showy but relatively easy piano part that would be backed up by two more mature and skilled soloists. However, there is no record of Rudolf's ever performing the work—it was not publicly premiered until 1808, at the summer \\"Augarten\\" concerts in Vienna—and when it came to be published, the concerto bore a dedication to a different patron: Prince Lobkowitz (Franz Joseph Maximilian Fürst von Lobkowitz). Movements The concerto is divided into three movements: #Allegro #Largo (attacca) #Rondo alla (polacca) '' The 1st movement plays standalone. There is no break between then 2nd and 3rd movements. The first movement is broadly scaled and cast in a moderate march tempo, and includes decorative solo passage-work and leisurely repetitions, variations, and extensions of assorted themes. A common feature is a dotted rhythm (short-long, short-long) that lends an air of graciousness and pomp that is not exactly \\"heroic,\\" but would have conveyed a character of fashionable dignity to contemporary listeners—and perhaps a hint of the noble \\"chivalric\\" manner that was becoming a popular element of novels, plays, operas, and pictures. The jogging triplets that figure in much of the accompaniment also contribute to this effect. In this movement, as in the other two, the cello enters solo with the first subject. Unusual for a concerto of this scale, the first movement begins quietly, with a gradual crescendo into the exposition, with the main theme later introduced by the soloists. Also unusually, the exposition modulates to A minor instead of the expected G major (Beethoven's friend Ferdinand Ries later did the same mediant transition in his sixth concerto). This movement takes sixteen to nineteen minutes. The slow movement, in A-flat major, is a large-scale introduction to the finale, which follows it without pause. The cello and violin share the melodic material of the movement between them while the piano provides a discreet accompaniment. This movement takes about five to six minutes. Dramatic repeated notes launch into the third movement, a polonaise (also called \\"polacca\\"), an emblem of aristocratic fashion during the Napoleonic era, which is, thus, in keeping with the character of \\"polite entertainment\\" that characterizes this concerto as a whole. The bolero-like rhythm, also characteristic of the polonaise, can be heard in the central minor theme of the final movement. This movement takes about thirteen to fourteen minutes. In addition to the violin, cello, and piano soloists, the concerto is scored for one flute, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings. The flute, oboes, trumpets, and timpani are tacet during the second movement.

His father, Friedrich August Burgmüller, and his younger brother, Norbert Burgmüller, were also composers. His mother was pianist and singer Therese von Zandt. He moved to Kassel in 1829 to study under Ludwig Spohr and Moritz Hauptmann. There he appeared as a pianist for his first concert, January 14, 1830. Burgmüller moved to Paris in 1832 (at age 26), where he stayed until his death. Norbert Burgmüller, his brother, made plans to join him in Paris, in 1835. However, he drowned in a spa in Aachen a year later. In Paris, Burgmüller adopted Parisian music and developed his trademark (light) style of playing. He wrote many pieces of salon music for the piano and published several albums. Burgmüller also went on to compose piano études intended for children. He died in Paris on February 13, 1874.

The park was initially known as Baffin Island National Park when it was established in 1972, but the name was changed in 1976 to its current name to better reflect the region and its history. It features many terrains of Arctic wilderness, such as fjords, glaciers, and ice fields. Although Auyuittuq was established in 1972 as a national park reserve, it was upgraded to a full national park in 2000. Location and access Auyuittuq National Park is located on the Cumberland Peninsula of Baffin Island in Nunavut. The park is located within the Arctic Circle. The park covers The Municipality of Pangnirtung website states that the park measures . and is located partially within the Penny Highlands and contains the Penny Ice Cap. The Penny Ice Cap, made of ice sitting on Precambrian granite, creates a series of glaciers, among them the Coronation Glacier. The land reflects the geological history of the area, with deep valleys between the peaks, which include Mount Asgard with an face, and Mount Thor with a face. Along the coast are deep, narrow fjords. In Akshayuk Pass, the winds can reach . The nearest towns are Qikiqtarjuaq and Pangnirtung. Visitors wishing to enter the park are required by Parks Canada to register at the park office in Pangnirtung or Qikiqtarjuaq, and attend an orientation session. Park user fees apply. History First established in 1972 as Baffin Island National Park, in 1975, Parks Canada chose to rename the park in order to better reflect the landscape and the Inuit history within the region. After some debate, the name was changed to Auyuittuq National Park, which is an Inuktitut word meaning \\"the place that does not melt\\". Flora and fauna Little vegetation can be found in Auyuittuq Park, although the plants found there range from flowers such as mountain avens, campion, Papaver, and saxifrage to shrubs like dwarf birch, Arctic willow, and heather. Many of the plants in Auyuittuq Park grow in clumps to create their own warmer \\"microclimate\\" to survive the harsh Arctic conditions. Because of the exceptionally low vegetation supply on land, wildlife is very scarce. However, the park is bordered on three sides by sea and marine life is found within the park's boundaries. Species that live in Auyuittuq Park include lemmings (both the North American brown lemming and the northern collared lemming), red foxes, snowy owls, peregrine falcons, ermines, rough-legged hawks, gyrfalcons, beluga whales, snow geese, polar bears, wolves, narwhals, Canada geese, Arctic foxes, Arctic hares, and some barren-ground caribou. Activities The most common backpacking route in the park is known as Akshayuk Pass, and follows the Weasel and Owl rivers via Summit Lake. In 2008, heavy rain and warm weather caused Summit Lake to burst through its banks, flooding the Weasel River and washing away the Windy Lake bridge. As a result, the hiking routes in the pass are limited to either side of the Weasel River.

He was considered one of two founders of the mathematical institutions of Vietnam; the other was Lê Văn Thiêm. Career Hoàng Tụy's early career coincided with the French war (1946–1954), which interrupted his studies. In December 1946, after two months as a mathematics student at Hanoi University, he had to return to the south, because the French had invaded and seized Hanoi, and the University had closed. Hoàng Tụy taught secondary school in Quảng Ngãi province in the Fifth Liberated Zone from 1947 to 1951, during which time he wrote a geometry textbook that was published by the Việt Minh press -- perhaps the first time a guerrilla movement published a math book. In the early 1950s, Hoàng Tụy studied with Lê Văn Thiêm in the university that the Việt Minh had opened in a liberated zone in the far north near the Chinese border. In September 1957 he went to the Soviet Union, where he studied real analysis under the supervision of D. E. Menshov and G. E. Shilov. Hoàng Tụy received his PhD in mathematics from Moscow State University in 1959. After returning to Vietnam from the Soviet Union, Hoàng Tụy changed his area of research from real analysis, which was too theoretical to be of immediate use in Vietnam, to operations research, a field of applied mathematics. It was Hoàng Tụy who first brought that field of research to Vietnam, and who invented the Vietnamese translation vận trù of \\"operations research.\\" Since that time Hoàng Tụy has worked mainly in the field of global optimization, where he did pioneering work. He had a long career with the Institute of Mathematics of the Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology, where he was director from 1980 to 1989. He published more than 160 refereed journal and conference articles. In 1997, a workshop in honor of Hoàng Tụy was organized at Linköping University, Sweden. In December 2007, an international conference on Nonconvex Programming was held in Rouen, France, to pay tribute to him on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in recognition of his pioneering achievements which advanced the field of global optimization.Website http://ncp07.insa-rouen.fr/ In September 2011, Professor Hoàng Tụy was named as the first-ever recipient of the Constantin Carathéodory Prize of the International Society of Global Optimization for his pioneering work and fundamental contributions to global optimization.Website http://www.globaloptimization.org/prizes/isogo-prizes/ =Papers= Publications in Math-Net.Ru * Conical algorithms for solving a concave programming problem and some generalizations S.

He held several administrative positions in government during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt and later became co- editor of the Marxist publication Monthly Review. Early years A child of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Magdoff grew up in the Bronx. In 1929, at age 15, Magdoff first started reading Karl Marx when he picked up a copy of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy in a used-book store. \\"It blew my mind,\\" recalled Magdoff in 2003. \\"His view of history was a revelation....that got me started reading about economics. We were going into the Depression then and I wanted to figure out what it all meant.\\"Susan Green, \\"The Sage of Imperialism\\", Seven Days, May 3, 2003. His interest in Marx led him to embrace socialism. Magdoff studied mathematics and physics from 1930 to 1933 at the City College of New York taking engineering, math and physics courses; he was active in the Social Problems Club with many schoolmates who later joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, a Comintern organization that fought in the Spanish Civil War, many also joined the US Armed Forces. Magdoff attended New York University after 1933, where he studied economics and statistics, receiving a B.Sc in Economics in 1935. He was suspended and later expelled from City College for activities related to editing Frontiers (a radical student magazine not sanctioned by the school), including participation in a mock trial of the school's President and its Director. Government service  After college, David Weintraub Head of the WPA's National Research Project assisted him to get a job with the Works Progress Administration measuring the productivity of various manufacturing industries. By 1940 Magdoff was the WPA's Principal Statistician. During World War II Magdoff worked on the National Defense and Advisory Board and the War Production Board, in the Statistical and Tools Divisions. He left the Commerce Department at the end of 1946. Post-government career Magdoff was happyFBI Silvermaster File, Part 5b, pg. 176; \\"On December 20, 1946 [...] Magdoff indicated that he was happy to be leaving the Commerce Department [...]\\" to leave his position with the United States Department of Commerce, on December 30, 1946, and went to work for the New Council on American Business in New York until 1948, at which time he began employment with Trubeck Laboratories in New Jersey. He was an economic adviser and speechwriter to former Vice- President and then unsuccessful Presidential candidate Henry Wallace, who ran as the Progressive Party candidate in 1948. Unable to be reemployed in government because of security concerns, he found a career in academia beginning in the 1950s. After the Cuban Revolution, Magdoff had an opportunity to travel to Cuba and have an all night meeting with Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara, whom he later described as a \\"sweet and polite man\\". This long brainstorming session on the potential obstacles the new revolution would face, sparked a mutual camaraderie that led to Magdoff also meeting with Guevara during his 1964 visit to the United Nations in New York City.Encounters with Che by Harry Magdoff, Monthly Review, 2004 One of his most famous works, The Age of Imperialism, his first and arguably most influential book, came out in 1969. The book sold over 100,000 copies and was translated into fifteen languages. Two years later after the death of Leo Huberman, Magdoff began co-editing the Monthly Review with Paul Sweezy, and continued to edit the magazine into his 90th year. Magdoff and Sweezy together produced five books, as well as many years of Monthly Review. One of Magdoff's last books was Imperialism without Colonies, published at age 89. Monthly Review is one of the preeminent socialist journals in the world, a journal characterized by its independent, nonsectarian Marxist approach. Under Magdoff's direction, the Monthly Review focused more and more upon imperialism as the key unit of analysis for global development and the forces challenging neocolonialism in the Third World. This perspective put the magazine and its press squarely on the New Left intellectual agenda since the late 1960s. His work also kept him in the forefront of socialist thought in the U.S. from the 1930s to this day. The Great Depression left a strong impact on Magdoff's perspective on capitalism, as Magdoff recalls a sense of doom felt in the mid- century by pro-capitalists, holding that nothing since 1929 led him to believe that the economy has become immune to cycles of severe crisis. Until his death, Magdoff co-edited the Monthly Review with John Bellamy Foster. Death Magdoff died on New Year's Day, 2006 at age 92. He had two sons, one of whom, Fred Magdoff, is an expert in plant and soil science. His wife of almost 70 years, Beatrice, died in 2002. Accusations of espionage Wikisource Wikisource has original text related to this article: Venona 687 KGB New York to Moscow, 13 May 1944, Perlo group Magdoff has been accused by a number of authors as having been complicit in Soviet espionage activity during his time in US government. He was accused of passing information to Soviet intelligence networks in the United States, primarily through what the FBI called the \\"Perlo Group.\\" Magdoff was never indicted, but after the end of the Cold War, a number of scholars have inspected declassified documents (including those of the Venona project) from U.S. and Soviet archives. They cite these documents to support the claim that Magdoff was involved in espionage. Other authors have taken issue with some of the broader interpretations of such materials which implicate many Americans in espionage for the Soviet Union, and the allegation that Harry Magdoff was an information source for the Soviets is disputed by several academics and historians asserting that Magdoff probably had no malicious intentions and committed no crimes.

Career  He was the oldest son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus and grandson of Lucius Caecilius Metellus. A brilliant general, he fought in the Fourth Macedonian War. In 148 BC, as a praetor he led the Roman troops into victory over Andriscus twice. Andriscus was a self-proclaimed pretender to the Macedonian throne who claimed to be son of Perseus, last king of the Antigonid dynasty. Andriscus had risen against Rome intending to liberate Macedonia with an army recruited from Thrace. Under Metellus' authority Macedonia was reduced and made a Roman province. For that he won his agnomen and since then introduced the Clypeus Macedoniccus in his family's medals. In 146 BC, he defeated Critolaos of Megalopolis at the Battle of Scarpheia and the Arcadians at Chaeronea but Metellus was then sent to fight in the Achaean War to avenge an insult offered to a Roman Embassy at Corinth. He fought under the command of consul Lucius Mummius Achaicus whose ultimate victory in the war against the Achaean League delayed Macedonicus from celebrating immediately the honours of the Triumph which his success at the battle of Scarpheia merited. On his return to Italy he received the honour of a Triumph and the title of Macedonicus. He then built at the Campus Martius a Porticus of Cecilius (Porticus Caecilii) which later became the Porticus of Octavia (Porticus Octaviae). He also built two grandiose temples: one dedicated to Jupiter and the other to Juno. These were the first marble temples in Rome, ornamented with equestrian statues of the various generals of Alexander brought by him from Greece. In 143-142 BC, when consul, he campaigned against the Celtiberians in central Hispania during the Numantine War, defeating the Arevaci, Lusones, Belli, Titii and the Vaccaei. He did not confront the city of Numantia, which then became the focus of the war and which resisted for ten years.Appian, Iberiké 76. In 133 BC, he gave a speech attacking Tiberius Gracchus regarding that tribune's plan to bypass the traditional prerogative of the senate and keep the vast fortune of the recently deceased Attalus III of Pergamon under the control of the Plebeian Assembly.Stockton 69 Attalus had bequeathed his kingdom to the people of Rome. Metellus was elected censor in 131 BC, boldly pledging to halt the growing degradation of Roman custom. In a speech which he delivered at his appointment, he proposed that matrimony was to be mandatory for all citizens, in order to put an end to the libertine behaviour then already widespread. A century later Augustus caused this speech to be read at the Senate and published as an edict for the knowledge and regeneration of the Roman People. His moralizing efforts awakened strong popular opposition, led by the tribune Gaius Atinius Labeo Macerio whom he had previously expelled from the Senate. He was almost killed by the mob on the Tarpeian Rock. Later there were some disagreements between him and Scipio Aemilianus, but he never lost sight of the merits of this adversary, whose death he mourned, ordering his sons to transport Aemilianus' body to the crematory pyre. Celebrated for his eloquence and his taste for the Arts, he died in 116/115 BC. He was generally respected as the paradigm of the fortunate Roman for from an illustrious birth he united all manner of civil and military honours, and left a large family of four sons, of whom one was then consul, two had already been and one would be soon. His two sons-in-law, Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio and Gaius Servilius Vatia would also attain the consulship.

They are often found in the colder climates and higher altitudes of the world where there is sufficient precipitation for them to form. The higher peaks of the underlying mountain rock that protrude through the icefields are known as nunataks. Ice fields are larger than alpine glaciers, but smaller than ice caps and ice sheets. The topography of ice fields is determined by the shape of the surrounding landforms, while ice caps have their own forms overriding underlying shapes. Formation Ice fields are formed by a large accumulation of snow which, through years of compression and freezing, turns into ice. Due to ice's susceptibility to gravity, ice fields usually form over large areas that are basins or atop plateaus, thus allowing a continuum of ice to form over the landscape uninterrupted by glacial channels. Glaciers often form on the edges of ice fields, serving as gravity-propelled drains off the ice field which is in turn replenished by snowfall. While an ice cap is not constrained by topography, an ice field is. An ice field is also distinguishable from an ice cap because it does not have a dome-like form.Summerfield (1999). Ice fields of the worldAsia= There are several ice fields in the Himalayas and Altay Mountains (the border range between the Central Asian Republics and China). One unexpected ice field is located in Yolyn Am, a mountain valley located in the northern end of the Gobi Desert. =Oceania= There are no ice fields in Australia. New Zealand has * Garden of Eden ice field * Garden of Allah ice fieldMap of the gardens * Olivine Ice PlateauGoogle map reference Reference:USGS SATELLITE IMAGE ATLAS OF GLACIERS OF THE WORLD, GLACIERS OF IRIAN JAYA, INDONESIA, AND NEW ZEALAND,GLACIERS OF NEW ZEALAND By TREVOR J.H. CHINN =Europe= The only large ice fields in mainland Europe are in Norway (e.g., Dovre and Jotunheimen). There are several dozen small ice fields in the Alps and tiny remnants of permanent ice in Sweden, the Apennines, the Pyrenees and the Balkans. Since the disappearance of the last remaining ice field in Andalucía, with the disappearance of the Corral del Veleta glacier in 1913, the southernmost surviving permanent ice field in continental Europe is Snezhnika in Bulgaria. Beyond the mainland of continental Europe, there are substantial ice fields in Iceland, Svalbard and Franz-Josef Land and smaller surviving ice fields on Jan Mayen and Novaya Zemlya. =North America= One of the more celebrated North American ice fields is the Columbia Icefield located in the Rocky Mountains between Jasper and Banff, Alberta. Easy access by road contributes to the status of this ice field as one of the most visited in North America, although it is actually a comparatively small ice field within the huge and largely ice-free American cordillera. Many particularly expansive ice fields lie in the Coast Mountains, Alaska Range, and Chugach Mountains of Alaska, British Columbia, and the Yukon Territory. The 6,500 km2 Stikine Icecap (located between the Stikine and Taku Rivers) and the 2,500 km2 Juneau Icefield (located between Lynn Canal and the Taku River) both straddle the British Columbian-Alaskan border. Farther north, the Kluane Icecap -- which feeds the immense Malaspina and Hubbard Glaciers as well as the Bagley Icefield -- sits upon the British Columbia-Yukon Territory-Alaska border and surrounds most of the Saint Elias Mountains as well as both Mount Saint Elias and Mount Logan; it extends as far west as the Copper River. There are also large ice fields located in the Kenai Peninsula-Chugach Mountains area, such as the Sargent Icefield and the Harding Icefield. Throughout the Alaska Range there also large icefields (including one surrounding Denali) which are mostly unnamed. =South America= In South America, there are two main ice fields, Campo de Hielo Norte (translates to Northern Ice Field or Northern Patagonian Ice Field), in Chile, and Campo de Hielo Sur (translates to Southern Ice Field or Southern Patagonian Ice Field), shared by Chile and Argentina. There is also a small ice field on the western (Chilean) portion of Tierra del Fuego proper.

Like the other members of the influential Caecilii Metelli family, he was a leader of the Optimates, the conservative faction opposed to the Populares during the last century of the Roman Republic. His father Metellus Numidicus was banished from Rome through the machinations of Gaius Marius and the Populares. The son, because of his constant and unbending attempts to have his father officially recalled from exile, was given the agnomen (nickname) Pius.Cic. P. Red. 37; Ad Quir. 6; Arch. 6; Vell. II 15, 3 During the civil wars (88-80 BC), Pius sided with Lucius Cornelius Sulla and the Optimates. He successfully commanded Sulla's forces in the northern theatre (northern Italy and Cisalpine Gaul). In 81 BC he became Pontifex Maximus, then consul the following year alongside Sulla. As proconsul Pius fought against Sertorius (a former supporter of Marius) on the Iberian Peninsula; in the so-called Sertorian War. He served alongside Pompey slowly grinding down the rebels from 79 to 72/71 BC. For his victories during the Sertorian War he was granted a Triumph. Early career Coin of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Metellus Pius, a member of the distinguished plebeian gens Caecilia, was the son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, who was consul in 109 BC. His career began in that same year, when he accompanied his father to Numidia as his contubernalis (cadet) during the Jugurthine War, returning to Rome in 107 BC, when his father was forcibly recalled by the actions of Gaius Marius.Sall. Iug. 64, 4; Plut. Mar. 8, 4 In 100 BC, after his father was banished as a result of the political manoeuvrings of Gaius Marius and Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, Metellus Pius launched a campaign to have his father brought back from exile. He produced a petition in 99 BC to this effect, and his constant pleading on the subject resulted in Quintus Calidius, the Plebeian Tribune of 98 BC passing a law which allowed his father to return.Broughton II, pg. 5 As a result of his fidelity, he was given the agnomen “Pius” for the constancy and inflexibility with which he fought for his father's political rehabilitation and return to Rome. Sometime during the 90s BC, Metellus Pius was elected to the College of Pontiffs as a result of his family's eminence and influence.Broughton II, pg. 37 The outbreak of the Social War saw him employed as a legate in late 89 BC, probably serving the consul Pompeius Strabo in the northern theatre; he won some battles against the Marsi.Brennan, p. 377; Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 108. As a result of these victories, he was elected praetor in the following year (88 BC).Brennan, p. 378; Broughton III, P. 41 During his praetorship, he was tasked with enrolling the Italian allies as new Roman citizens within sixty days, in accordance with the Lex Plautia Papiria.Brennan, pp 377-378 Once this was completed, Metellus Pius returned to the front, and replaced the legate Gaius Cosconius on the southern front. He harassed the territory around Apulia, captured the town of Venusia, and defeated the rebel leader, Quintus Poppaedius Silo, who died during the storming of Venusia.Broughton II, p. 42; Brennan, p. 378; Diod. XXXVII 2, 9—11; App. BC I 53; Auc. Vir. Ill. 63, 1. Cicero, at the time a young man, remembered hearing Metellus speak at contiones in Rome during this period, most likely during Metellus' praetorship. Cicero remarked of Metellus' ability: 'although no real orator, he was nonetheless not without some capacity for public speech'.Cic. Brut. 305 In 88 BC, after being sidelined by his political opponents, Sulla marched his legions on Rome and took the capital. He took revenge on his enemies and forced Marius into exile. Sulla then left Italy and went east to fight in the First Mithridatic War against Mithridates VI of Pontus. In 87 BC, Metellus Pius' command was extended, with his appointment as propraetor, responsible for continuing the war against Samnium. Later that year, however, saw a dispute between the two consuls Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gnaeus Octavius flare up into war. Cinna, expelled from Rome, met up with the exiled Gaius Marius, and with their ally Quintus Sertorius they marched on Rome and laid siege to the city. During the early phase of this conflict, the Senate, fearing that they may need additional troops and commanders, ordered Metellus Pius to negotiate a peace with the Samnites.Broughton II, p. 47 Marching to Rome, he made camp at the Alban Hills, accompanied by Publius Licinius Crassus. Here he met up with Gnaeus Octavius, who had abandoned Rome, but both men soon fell out with each other, over Metellus Pius' troops demanding that their commander take over overall command from Gnaeus Octavius. The Senate then asked him to negotiate with Cinna on their behalf, during which time he recognized Cinna as the legitimate consul.Lovano, p. 44; Broughton II, p. 47 However, with Cinna's occupation of Rome and the executions initiated by Gaius Marius, Metellus Pius decided to abandon Rome and head to North Africa.Brennan, p. 379; Broughton II, p. 47 Supporter of Sulla Fantasy portrait of Metellus Pius from Guillaume Rouillé's Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum Arriving in Africa by early 86 BC, Metellus Pius started raising an army from his private clients, with the intent of joining Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who had been the principal opponent of Cinna and Marius.Lovano, pg. 71 He was joined by Marcus Licinius Crassus, but both men fell out, and Crassus was forced to leave and eventually join up with Sulla in Greece.Lovano, pg. 115; Brennan, pg. 543 Metellus acted as propraetorian governor of the province,Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.67 but this was unrecognized by Cinna and his regime at Rome.Broughton II, pg. 55 Nevertheless, it wasn't until 84 BC that the Marians at Rome were able to send out their own governor, Gaius Fabius Hadrianus.Broughton II, pg. 60 Upon his arrival, he drove out Metellus Pius who fled to Numidia; pursued here, he and the Numidian king Hiempsal II were forced to flee onwards to Mauretania.Lovano, pg. 95 From here, Metellus Pius made his way to Liguria (in North-Western Italy) by late 84 BC or early 83 BC.Broughton II, pg. 61 By 83 BC, Sulla had returned from the east and was marching slowly to Rome for his confrontation with the Marian regime. Moving quickly, Metellus Pius was the first to meet him along the Via Appia, bringing new troops with him. He, like many of the aristocracy, only joined Sulla when it was prudent to do so, and not because they approved of his measures, such as his first march on Rome.Gruen, pgs. 7 & 18 Regardless, recognizing Metellus as possessing propraetorian imperium and his influence as a member of the powerful Metellan faction, Sulla made him his principal subordinate.Brennan, pg. 381; Lovano, pg. 115 By July 83 BC, the Senate, under the direction of the consul Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, declared Metellus Pius a public enemy.Lovano, pg. 120 In 82 BC, Sulla sent him to secure the northern parts of Italy, he was accompanied by young Pompey Magnus, Marcus Crassus and Marcus Lucullus. Metellus attacked and defeated Gaius Carrinas in Picenum. He then achieved a victory over the consul Papirius Carbo and his general Gaius Norbanus at Faventia, pacifying Cisalpine Gaul for Sulla.Broughton II, pg. 68 With Sulla's victory in 82 BC, he began rewarding his supporters, and made Metellus Pius the Pontifex Maximus in 81 BC, following the murder of Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex.Broughton II, pg. 78 He was also a Monetalis from 82 BC to 80 BC.Broughton III, pgs. 40-41 During this entire period, he was shown to be one of Sulla's best subordinates. An optimate and traditionalist he was a natural supporter of the Senate's prerogatives, he had no other objective apart from fighting the populism of Marius and Cinna, and did not participate in the atrocious violence during the reign of the dictatorship of Sulla. Finally in 80 BC, he was appointed consul alongside Sulla.Broughton II, pg. 79Cic. Arch. 6—7, 9, 31 Metellus Pius used his position to reward Quintus Calidius, who had helped bring his father back, by supporting his bid for the praetorship.Smith, pg. 1060 Sertorian War Sometime during his consulship, Quintus Sertorius, an opponent of Sulla, established himself in Spain and began a rebellion against the Senate. In 80 BC, after Sertorius had defeated Fufidius, the governor of Hispania Ulterior, the Senate decided to send Metellus Pius once his term as consul had ended. Upgrading Hispania Ulterior to a consular province, they dispatched Metellus Pius to take charge of the war against Sertorius.Broughton II, pg. 84; Brennan, pg. 506 Arriving in Spain in 79 BC Metellus Pius established his bases at Metellinum (today Medellín), Castra Caecilia (today Cáceres), Viccus Caecilius, at the Sierra de Gredos, and at Caeciliana, near Setúbal.Broughton II, pg. 82 From the start, it was clear that Metellus Pius was outclassed by the brilliant SertoriusGruen, pg. 18 suffering repeated defeats through Sertorius’ use of guerrilla tactics. His legate Thorius (probably Lucius Thorius BalbusPhilip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.80.) −dispatched to come to the assistance of the governor of Hispania Citerior, Marcus Domitus Calvinus− was defeated by Sertorius (79 BC).Brennan, pg. 506; Broughton II, pg. 84 After Thorius's defeat Metellus decided to take on Sertorius himself. Metellus was a solid if unspectacular general, under normal circumstances he would have easily trounced his opponent, but now he was pitted against the tactically brilliant Sertorius.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.81. Plutarch describes the unequal campaign which followed: ::He [Metellus] was accustomed to regular warfare with heavy infantry. He liked to command a solid, ponderous bloc of infantry. This formation was superbly trained to push back and vanquish the enemy in close quarter combat. For constantly chasing men who floated like the wind over the mountains he had to climb for enduring -as their enemy did- constant hunger without either tent or campfire, his army was useless. The light armour en consequent agility of his Iberian warriors meant Sertorius was constantly shifting his focus and changing the situation, until Metellus was at his wits' end. Metellus was no longer young, and after the many heroic contests of his youth he was now somewhat inclined to ease and luxury, while Sertorius was full of mature vigour. ... When Sertorius challenged Metellus to single combat, Metellus' men cheered and urged him to fight it out, general to general, and they mocked him when he declined.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 12-13 passim After an unsuccessful push towards the Tagus in 79 BC, and suffering a defeat by Sertorius at Lacobriga in 78 BC, Pius was forced to ask for help from Lucius Manlius, the governor of Gallia Transalpina, but Manlius was defeated by Sertorius's legate Lucius Hirtuleius upon entering the Iberian peninsula and had to retreat.Sallust, Histories, 1.113; Orosius, Contra Paganos, 5.23; Broughton II, pgs. 82 & 86; Brennan, pg. 506; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.83-84 The end result was that an exhausted Pius was pushed out of his province (Hispania Ulterior).Brennan, pg. 512 When the consuls of 78 BC declined to join Metellus Pius as proconsuls once their terms ended, the Senate in late 77 BC, hearing of Pius’ ongoing reverses at the hands of Sertorius, decided to send Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus with a large army to give Pius what assistance he could, while Pius’ governorship was prorogued.Gruen, pgs. 18-19 Both men worked well together, but were hard pressed to win any encounter with Sertorius himself.Gruen, pg. 19 With Pompey's arrival in 76 BC, Sertorius turned his attention to him, inflicting severe losses on the Pompeian army at the Battle of Lauron.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.31; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18.3; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 18; John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp.226-227; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.96-101. Unfortunately for Sertorius, his legates were not able to contain Metellus, and he arrived just in time to save Pompey. Against Sertorius's legates Metellus and Pompey had more success. In 75 BC, Pompey defeated Sertorius's legates Perpenna and Herrenius at the Battle of ValentiaPlutarch, Life of Pompey, 18; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.48; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 117-118. while Metellus defeated Hirtuleius at the Battle of Italica.Livy, Epitome, 91.4; Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.1.2 and 2.3.5; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.47; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.118-119; Broughton II, pg. 93. =Italica= The battle was Metellus’ first major victory in the Sertorius War. It freed Metellus’ army from the western theatre and allowed him to march against Sertorius’ rear in the eastern theatre. Metellus and Hirtuleius were campaigning near the Roman colony of Italica when Hirtuleius made the mistake of trying to force his opponent into a pitched battle. He mustered his army soon after dawn and marched on Metellus' encampment. Metellus mustered his troops too, but kept them behind his entrenchments until noon. It was extremely hot and Hirtuleius' troops were soon sweltering while Metellus' legionaries remained relatively fresh.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.1.2. Since his enemy remained drawn up in front of his camp for hours, Metellus had plenty of time to study their dispositions and make his own plans accordingly. He had observed that Hirtuleius had posted his strongest units in the centre of his battle-line.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 119. When the battle finally commenced Metellus held back his own centre and concentrated on winning on the flanks. After defeating his opponents flanks he enveloped Hirtuleius centre and slaughtered them.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.3.5. This was the classic tactic used by Hannibal at Cannae almost a century and a half ago. Hirtuleius lost 20,000 men at ItalicaJohn Leach, Pompey the Great, p. 48. and fled north to join his commander Sertorius who was squaring off against Pompey. =Sucro and Saguntum= Metellus came to the aid of Pompey after his near defeat at SucroAppian, Civil Wars, 1.110; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 19; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18; Pompey had refused to wait for Metellus before engaging Sertorius in battle and almost lost his army.. They then followed Sertorius inland to a town called Segontia and finally won a battle against Sertorius himself.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 21; Appian, Civil Wars, 1.110. Metellus was acclaimed imperator by his men.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 22; Brennan, pg. 508; Broughton II, pg. 98 Plutarch remarks that this battle was forced upon Sertorius.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 21. This was probably done by his Celt-Iberian troops who wanted to defend Segontia, one of their native towns. The fighting started at noon and lasted well into the night. Sertorius first fought Pompey while his legates Perpenna and Hirtuleius fought Metellus. After Hirtuleius had fallen Sertorius switched places with Perpenna and launched several personally-led attacks on Metellus.Sertorius probably reckoned Metellus' army would break without its leader. Metellus stood his ground and in the course of the fight he was wounded by a spear. This turned out to be a turning point in the battle, for Metellus' men counter-attacked in revenge and pushed back the Iberians. ::All the Romans who saw or heard of this [Metellus being wounded] were filled with shame at the idea of deserting their commander. The same event filled them with fury against the enemy. So, they covered Metellus with their shields and carried him out of danger. Then they fell energetically on the Iberians and pushed them back. Victory changed sides. Metellus then complacently decided to rest his troops and made camp. Sertorius in the meantime had regrouped his men and in the evening launched an unexpected attack on Metellus' camp, and attempted to exploit its vulnerable position by cutting it off with a trench. Unfortunately for the Sertorians, Pompey and his army now showed up and forced them to withdraw. Over the course of the battle Pompey had lost 6,000 men while Sertorius had lost only 3,000, but to offset this Perperna had lost some 5,000 soldiers. Metellus' losses are unknown, but must have been significant as well.Appian, Civil Wars, 1.110. =The final years= Metellus Pius spent the winter of 75-74 BC in Gaul, where he received two legions in reinforcements. Upon his return to Spain in 74 BC, he captured the towns of Bilbilis and Segobriga, before joining Pompey at the siege of Calagurris. They were forced to raise the siege when Sertorius approached, after which Pius returned to Gaul.Broughton II, pg. 104; Brennan, pg. 508 He then offered a reward of 100 silver talents and 20,000 acres of land to any Roman who would betray Sertorius.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.51. This resulted in Sertorius no longer trusting his Roman bodyguard and exchanged it for a Spanish one. Continued successes during 73 BC saw him ease up and allow Pompey to take the burden of the final phases of the war, with Sertorius’ murder in 72 BC. He imposed new taxes in Hispania Ulterior after the end of Sertorius’ rebellion.Matthew Dillon, Lynda Garland, Ancient Rome: From the Early Republic to the Assassination of Julius Caesar (2005), pg. 92 Pius’ governorship ended in 71 BC with the end of the war. He disbanded his army after crossing the Alps, and celebrated a triumph together with Pompey on December 30, 71 BC.Broughton II, pg. 122; Smith, pg. 1060 Regardless of the triumph, during those eight years of resistance he was unable to conclusively defeat Sertorius, and it was only after Sertorius' assassination by his own men that the rebels were forced to cede to the military ability of Metellus Pius.Sallust Hist.

Though Pompey was largely untouchable, senatorial resentment could be visited upon his clients and (former) subordinates. When the former Plebeian tribune and associate of Pompey, Gaius Cornelius, was accused of maiestas, the prosecution called on as witnesses a number of key anti-Pompeian former consuls, including Metellus Pius.Gruen, pgs. 262-265 Metellus Pius was a friend and patron of the noted poet Aulus Licinius Archias.Gruen, pg. 267 Pius died around 63 BC, the year that Julius Caesar replaced him as Pontifex Maximus. Family relations He married Licinia Crassa Secunda or Minor, daughter of Lucius Licinius Crassus Orator, and wife Mucia Secunda, from whom he had no children. For this reason he adopted his nephew by marriage and son of his second cousin Publius Cornelius Scipio, renamed Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica. He was the son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius's wife's sister Licinia Crassa Prima or Major and Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio, who was in turn the son of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio and Caecilia Metella, daughter of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus. In fiction Metellus Pius is a prominent character in the novels The First Man in Rome, The Grass Crown and Fortune's Favorites by Colleen McCullough. In the novels he is characterised as having a stutter, and is referred to by contemporaries, including Sulla, as “the Piglet”. He is also mentioned in John Maddox Roberts' SPQR series as the fictional main character Decius Caecilius Metellus' uncle.

Gunn rose to prominence as the autoharp-playing half of the Brobdingnagian Bards. He and partner Andrew McKee developed a following with weekly performances on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. This led to gigs at renaissance faires, science fiction conventions, and Celtic music festivals as well as parties and weddings for the pair. The group headlined at the Oscar party for The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After the group split up in 2008, Gunn became a prolific recording musician in the Celtic music community, releasing eleven new albums between 2008 and 2011. His recording of \\"Rising of the Moon\\" earned an award in 2013 in the Celtic Radio Music Awards for \\"Best Roots Traditional\\". Gunn was one an early adopter of podcasting and one of the few professional podcasters. He started podcasting in May 2005, but it was July when he released his most-successful podcast, Irish & Celtic Music Podcast. This show began as a spinoff of his Celtic Music Magazine email newsletter. It quickly eclipsed the newsletter's success. The Irish & Celtic Music Podcast is an hour-long show focusing primarily on independent Celtic musicians and bands. The music styles range from traditional Irish songs and tunes to modern Celtic rock from around the world. It won in the \\"Best Podsafe Music\\" category three times in the Podcast Awards in 2009, 2010, and 2017. Musical career Marc Gunn began his Celtic music career has one-half of the Brobdingnagian Bards. He produced the Bards' early albums. In 2004, Gunn released his first solo album, Soul of a Harper. He then embarked on work on one of his most-popular albums, Irish Drinking Songs for Cat Lovers. The Brobdingnagian Bards band broke up amicably on September 15, 2008. Gunn began performing solo. He released several albums a year with four full-length studio albums released in 2008, three in 2009, and two in 2010. Gunn continued releasing 1–2 albums each year. He began diverging from his traditional Celtic music base with more Geek-themed albums inspired by Firefly, Lord of the Rings, and other science fiction pop culture media shows. He performs solo and with groups at various conventions like Gen Con and Dragon Con each year. Podcasting career As a fan of Celtic music, Marc Gunn started the Celtic Music Magazine in 2000. It began as a weekly publication that reviewed Celtic music of all varieties from Irish traditional music to Celtic rock. On July 28, 2005, he began publishing the Irish & Celtic Music Podcast. It was the second podcast of Celtic music to be released. Gunn created the show to help independent Celtic musicians find new fans. The show grew in popularity. In its early days, it is claimed to have had over 20,000 downloads per episode and was one of the top music podcasts on iTunes. The show currently claims over 10,000 downloads per episode and is in the top 90% of all podcasts, according to Libsyn stats. In 2008, the podcast won \\"Best Podsafe Music\\" in the annual podcast awards. This win was repeated in 2009 and again in 2017. Gunn was one of the first professional podcasters. In 2006, he started Song Henge to fund the podcast production. In 2014, he joined Patreon.

Originally named Michael, her parents changed the spelling (but retained the pronunciation) so as not to confuse her with a male producer and children's author of the time (Michael Brown). Miquel is the mother of singer Sinitta and the stepsister of singer Amii Stewart. Early life She was born in Montreal on 8 February 1945 and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada,Hamilton, Andrew \\"[ Miquel Brown Biography]\\", AllMusic. Retrieved 22 January 2010 Miquel gave birth to twins Sinitta and Greta on 19 October 1963 when she was only 18. She was prompted to leave university after she auditioned for the U.S. touring company of the musical Hair and landed the part of Sheila. At the end of the Hair tour she visited Australia. In 1973, she was cast as the lead in Decameron '73 at the Roadhouse in London. She was then interviewed on the Michael Parkinson Show. In 1975 she appeared in the film Rollerball with James Caan, as well as in the role of Miriam in the television film Regan in 1974 for the Armchair Cinema ITV strand, which was effectively the pilot for The Sweeney TV series. She also held a two-year association with the singing and dancing group 'Second Generation'. Through the next two years she performed various parts in Bubbling Brown Sugar and television appearances in Seaside Special (on Saturday, 25 June 1977), Supersonic (on Saturday, 5 March 1977 – show 40), The Ronnie Corbett Show, Jack Parnell's Show, Vince Hill's Musical Time Machine and Bruce Forsyth's Bring on the Girls. Music career In 1976, she played Sister Anna in the musical Mardi Gras (which opened on 18 March at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London). It was through this that she was discovered and signed for her first record release, \\"First Time Around\\". This led her to musician Alan Hawkshaw (of Emile Ford and the Checkmates, The Shadows and Love De-Luxe), who signed her for an album deal. The album Symphony of Love (1978) included the title track, \\"Dancin' with the Lights Down Low\\", \\"This is Something New to Me\\", \\"The Day They Got Disco in Brazil\\", \\"Do It\\" and \\"Something Made of Love\\". Also in 1978, she appeared in the American film Superman, as the non-speaking eighth reporter in a scene following the first Superman spotting. In need of a new producer in the early 1980s, Brown crossed the paths of Ian Levine and Fiachra Trench in 1983. Together with Record Shack Records, they created the album Manpower, a Hi-NRG release. The first single released from the album, \\"So Many Men – So Little Time\\" reached No. 88 on the UK Singles Chart on 11 June 1983. and peaked at number No. 2 on the club chart. In the two years following Manpower, she appeared in stage productions of Only in America, the Leiber and Stoller Musical; The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and One Mo' Time, as well as in numerous international clubs, but did not release any more albums until 1985. Close to Perfection (also produced by Levine) could not compete with her first success. The album featured two US dance radio and dance chart hits, with \\"Black Leather\\" and \\"Close to Perfection \\", the latter of which gave her her highest UK Singles Chart placing (#63) for seven weeks. In 1986, she filled in for The Three Degrees singer Helen Scott while Scott was pregnant. Brown helped the Degrees as they had a single called \\"This Is The House\\" to promote around Europe. Later songs include \\"On the Radio\\", \\"Footprints in the Sand\\" and \\"This Time It's Real\\", all with Nightmare Records. In 1989, she was seen as Jill in the second episode of the fourth series, \\"Accidents Happen\\", of the British show Casualty. The 1990s In 1990, she released the songs \\"I Was Strong (My Moment)\\" and \\"Which Way Is Up\\" on Hansa. In 1995, she starred as the Housekeeper in Solomon and Sheba, with Halle Berry. Also in 1995 she played Sgt. Patton in French Kiss, with Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline. She can be heard on the London cast recordings of Elegies for Angels, Punks and Raging Queens (1993) and Fame (1995) (as Miss Sherman, the English teacher). 2000 to present Brown played the Negro Woman in the 2001 play A Streetcar Named Desire at the Royal National Theatre (Lyttelton), in London, directed by Trevor Nunn and starring Glenn Close as Blanche DuBois. She also appeared in the 2001 film Wit, where she has a brief exchange with Emma Thompson (who plays Vivian Bearing), as the second technician. In 2004, Brown appeared as Idella in the London production of Purlie at the Bridewell Theatre in London (a role originally played by Helen Martin, from the American sitcom 227). Miquel Brown: The Lady, Her Loves and Her Lord was presented at the Bullion Room Theatre in London in 2005. In 2005, Brown appeared as Chloe the old maid in An American Haunting with Sissy Spacek. The following year, 2006, she co- starred alongside Robert Ashe in the drama film 9/11: The Twin Towers. In 2006, Brown appeared in the movie London Successor as Lolo. In 2007, she starred in the original London production of Menopause The Musical. In March 2008, Brown was seen when her daughter Sinitta appeared on UK's Celebrity Wife Swap, swapping partners with ex-Coronation Street actor Bruce Jones.

It was the second single from Apollo 18, released in 1992 by Elektra Records. They Might Be Giants performed the song on Late Night with David Letterman in 1992.\\"They Might Be Giants – 'I Palindrome I'\\". YouTube. 11 May 2011. Retrieved 2014-01-19. Michael McKean recites the lyrics of the song in the documentary Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns.Schnack, AJ. \\"They Might Be Giants: Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns\\". Composition The title of \\"I Palindrome I\\" came from a demo written by John Flansburgh for They Might Be Giants's telephone service, Dial-A-Song. John Linnell adapted the lyric after attending a reading by the American poet Hal Sirowitz. The song's opening line, \\"Someday mother will die and I'll get the money\\", is a reference to Sirowitz's portrayal of mother-child relationships. The song contains several palindromes and references to the concept of recursion. For example, the lyrics contain the straightforward palindromes \\"Egad, a base tone denotes a bad age\\" and \\"Man o nam\\". The middle 8 consists of what critic Stewart Mason calls a \\"sentence palindrome\\", in which the words (rather than the letters) are the units in a sequence which reads the same backwards and forwards. The lyrics also reference \\"a snake head eating the head on the opposite side\\" (an ouroboros), which reviewer Ira Robbins interprets as \\"a grim life mask [carved] from the conceptual clay of reversible phrases\\". Reception \\"I Palindrome I\\" received generally positive attention from critics. Writing for Allmusic, Stewart Mason concluded that the song was musically appealing enough to overcome its shallow lyrics, which he felt employed wordplay for its own sake rather than \\"in the service of a particular idea or emotion\\". In a review of Apollo 18, Karen Schlosberg said that the lyrics of \\"I Palindrome I\\" sound like \\"Edgar Allan Poe and David Lynch meeting the Monkees\\", creating an \\"unlikely sing-along hook\\".Schlosberg, Karen (20 March 1992). \\"Giant Steps: Apollo 18 Goes Where No Band Have Gone Before\\".

The full official name of the station is (in English: Constitution Square Station) reflecting the fact that the station is located opposite Constitution Square, two kilometers to the south of the landmark. The ground floor of the station has fourteen tracks and the floor below has two tracks for the Buenos Aires Underground. History The original terminal in the 1890s On 7 March 1864, in a ceremony attended by the president Bartolomé Mitre, construction began at Mercado Constitución, on the site of the present day terminus, as the British-owned Buenos Aires Great Southern railway company began building its first broad gauge line of 114 km as far as Chascomús. The first section of the line to Jeppener, Buenos Aires, was opened on 14 August 1865; during that same month a small terminal station at Mercado Constitución was opened to the public and renamed Plaza Constitución. Later that year in December the line to Chascomús was opened. Station platforms, c. 1900 Between 1885 and 1887 the Plaza Constitución terminus was rebuilt and enlarged and between 1906 and 1907 further building work was carried out and extra platforms were added to cope with the increasing suburban traffic. In 1912 yet more platforms were added. On 19 September 1925 a foundation stone for the present day terminus was laid by the Prince of Wales, later Duke of Windsor, during his official visit to Argentina. The original station was then rebuilt with fourteen platforms roofed over, modern hydraulic buffer stops and an imposing concourse which formed a massive main hall, one of the largest in the world, along the entire length of the site. Of the fourteen platforms, only two or three were normally used for mainline trains, leaving the rest for suburban services. To the east of the main station a large goods and parcels section with warehouses, offices and several sidings was built. The street frontage of the original station was left untouched due to financial constraints imposed towards the end of the rebuilding. The station was the site of a riot on May 16, 2007, during the evening rush hour, which provoked debate and discussion in Argentina about railway privatisation. A crowded train broke down within walking distance of the station blocking the railway and the irate passengers from trains trapped at the station, after waiting for the train to be fixed and to move, walked to the platform, thus triggering the chaos. Around 25 people were injured, and a total of 16 were arrested and later released.Argentina's privatised railways Operation Main hall in 2014 All southbound trains on the Roca Line have their terminus at Constitución and the station is served by Trenes Argentinos, the national train operator which provides commuter services through the Roca Line to the nearby city of La Plata and to the surrounding suburbs of Buenos Aires. Trenes Argentinos also operates long-distance services throughout much of Buenos Aires Province on the General Roca Railway, formerly operated by defunct company Ferrobaires. Major destinations include Mar del Plata, Miramar, and Bahía Blanca, with connecting services further south to Carmen de Patagones. Constitución is accessible by the Line C of the Buenos Aires Underground and by numerous public bus services (including the colectivo 60 service), and by long-distance bus services. From 1944 to 1966, it was also served by Line E with a station there, however this was closed when the line was re-routed further towards the centre of the city. In the future, the station will also serve as the terminus for Line F which began construction in 2015.Realizarán estudios en Constitución para ubicar la cabecera de la línea F - EnElSubte, 1 August 2011. The surrounding neighbourhood - part of Neighbourhood of Constitución - is characterised by low-rent residences for people from the provinces (or from neighbouring Paraguay and Bolivia) who come to work in the city.  In media  Several films have been filmed at the station, the most important of which are There Be Dragons and On Probation. Also several novels take place in the station and its surroundings.

Asphaug received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and English from Rice University and his PhD in planetary science from the University of Arizona. Until 2012, Asphaug served as a professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz. The 1998 recipient of the Harold C. Urey Prize from the American Astronomical Society, Asphaug is at the forefront of scientists studying the \\"rubble pile\\" composition of most asteroids and the implications of such composition on efforts to divert asteroids from striking the Earth. Asphaug has also worked with Urey Prize winner Robin M. Canup to develop new theories on how the Moon was formed. Recently he has studied the genesis of diverse small planets and asteroids in the aftermath of collisions between similar-sized planetoids during the middle to late stages of terrestrial planet formation. Asphaug was involved in NASA's Galileo and LCROSS missions. He is currently a principal advocate of a mission strategy to obtain a medical-like scan of the detailed interior structure of a Jupiter-family comet, which would reveal its origin, evolution and structure using techniques of 3D radar imaging and tomography. Asteroid 7939 Asphaug was named in his honor. Asphaug is an Eagle Scout.

The Symphonic Orchestra, under the new direction of Mrs. Jennifer Herrera, played as an honor orchestra in the 2005 Virginia Music Educator's Association. There is also a Concert Orchestra, an orchestra below the level of the Symphonic Orchestra. A third orchestra is the Chamber Orchestra, a level above the Symphonic Orchestra, which was established in the 2008 school year for the elite players. WSHS has a Guitar program, with school-provided guitars for students to use. Their Jazz Guitar Combo is one of few high school groups of its kind in the region. They receive consistent ratings of \\"Superior,\\" as does the Advanced Guitar Ensemble and Guitar Ensemble. The current director is Mr. Keith Owens. The Guitar Program is currently the largest music department in terms of population, with their 5 different levels of difficulty. Many freshman begin with Guitar 1 to learn the basics of the guitar, with many going on to Guitar 2, and many still go on to other ensembles. Members of the guitar program frequently show off their talents in West Springfield's Battle of the Bands, which every year proves to be phenomenal. The choral program at WSHS features five classes, four of which require auditions. Concert Choir is an unauditioned mixed choir. The four audition choirs are Bel Canto, Madrigals, Personality, and Musical Theatre. Bel Canto is an all-women's choir that sometimes sings a cappella. Madrigals is a mixed a cappella choir, and the most musically proficient choir. Personality, a mixed show choir, briefly became an all-female show choir from 2010–2013 due to lack of male interest, but has become a mixed show choir once again for the 2013–2014 school year. Musical Theatre, offered for the first time in the 2009–2010 school year, is a mixed ensemble which performs songs from musicals, usually medleys, in addition to performing and critiquing solo songs during class. The all-women's show choir, Pizazz, was disbanded at the end of 2007, despite its numerous awards, due to lack of interest. At competitions, the Choral Department has received many awards and recognitions, as well as many \\"Superior\\" ratings over the past several years. All choral classes were taught by Michael Dombrow from Fall 2002 through Spring 2008, and all show choir performances were choreographed by John Gonzalez during this time. Choral director Erin Huss became the new chorus teacher in the 2008–09 school year and retired at the end of the 2012 school year to be replaced by Dustin Brandt. Personality's dances are often choreographed by student directors with dance experience and are revised by the choir director. Huss founded the musical theatre class because of her experience in the area and choreographs all dances. Theatre The West Springfield Theatre Department has taken part in the Cappies Critics program since it began in 2002. The department is known for its high quality shows that have garnered many positive reviews. In 2013, West Springfield's production of \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" received a Cappie for Best Lead Actress in a Play (Catherine Ariale); and in the same year, won the VHSL state one-act competition for its show \\"The Other Room.\\" In 2011, West Springfield's production of \\"Seussical\\" received a nomination for Best Male Vocalist (Rick Leith). In 2010, \\"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" won a Cappie for Best Make-up. Kelsey Rose was also nominated for Creativity for composing music and Megan Fraedrich was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a play. In 2009, West Springfield was nominated for Best Costumes, Best Stage Crew, and Best Lead Actress in a Musical (Erin Cafferky) for \\"Annie Get Your Gun\\". In 2008, Sara Meinhofer won a Cappie for Best Choreography for \\"The Music Man.\\" In addition, the school was nominated for Best Sound, Best Sets, Best Stage Crew, Best Orchestra, Best Ensemble in a Musical, and Best Lead Actress in a Musical (Sara Meinhofer).

Slippy had the ability to morph into various useful shapes. Sid was also the leader of the \\"Whizz-Kids\\" (characters who featured in the Whizzer section of the comic, as opposed to the \\"Chip-ites\\") and, bar the first issue (in which he appeared on the front cover of Chips, usually Shiner's job) he appeared on the front cover of the comic until the mid-1980s. The strip survived the merger with Buster in 1990. Though the strip was no longer the leader of the Whizz-Kids, it still appeared in Buster until the comic's last issue at the beginning of 2000.

Life Born in Maidenhead, Berkshire, England, the son of William Doughty, Doughty was educated at the public schools in Maidenhead, at Lord Eldon School in London, and at New Inn Hall, Oxford. He emigrated to Canada in 1886 settling in Montreal. He was appointed to a position in the revenue department of the government of Quebec and in 1897 became private secretary to the Minister of Public Works. In 1900, he was named joint librarian of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec and in May 1904 was appointed as the second Dominion Archivist and Keeper of the Records. He served in this post until 1935.The correct date of his appointment as Dominion Archivist is given in Report on Canadian Archives for 1904. (Canada, Sessional Paper No. 18, A. 1905) Under his leadership, the Public Archives of Canada undertook to locate and list important archival material in different areas of Canada. He wrote or edited a number of books, on topics such as the Siege of Quebec and the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, 1759; Canadian constitutional documents, and the 23-volume work Canada and its Provinces, which Doughty edited with Adam Shortt.collectionscanada.gc.ca: \\"A Real Companion and Friend: The diary of William Lyon Mackenzie King - Behind the Diary - A King's Who's Who Biographies - Sir Arthur George Doughty (1860-1936)\\" He wrote the article on Samuel de Champlain for the Catholic Encyclopedia.\\"Doughty, Arthur G.\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, New York, the Encyclopedia Press, 1917, p. 46 In 1900, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.

He encouraged the creation of archives by the provincial governments and served on the Board of the Public Archives of Nova Scotia when it was reconstituted in 1929. Across the world, one of the most quoted statements made by Sir Arthur George Doughty in 1924 concerned the essential value of keeping and maintaining good and full records in an organised national archive when he said: \\"Of all national assets, archives are the most precious, they are the gifts of one generation to another, and the extent of our care of them marks the extent of our civilisation. As a rule the papers of a given generation are seldom required after their reception and primary use; but when all personal touch with that period has ceased, then these records assume a startling importance, for they replace hands that have vanished and lips that are sealed.\\" Following his death, a statue of Sir Arthur was erected behind the National Archives of Canada, overlooking the Ottawa River This is one of only two statues of civil servants erected in Ottawa, both during MacKenzie King's tenure as Prime Minister.

S. Van Dyke.  Plot  Private detective Guy Johnson (James Stewart) is well paid to watch over Willie Heyward (Ernest Truex), a wealthy man who likes to drink a bit too much and gets into trouble as a result. However, when Heyward's recent ex- girlfriend Dolores Gonzalez (Cecilia Callejo) makes a public nuisance of herself over their relationship, a drunk Heyward goes to see her, not knowing it is a setup. Dolores is being held at gunpoint by a man, so when Heyward enters her apartment, the mystery man kills Dolores and frames Heyward for the murder. The only clue is half of a dime incorporated into a piece of jewelry that the victim managed to snatch from her assailant. Guy hurries to the scene soon after and hides his client so he can catch the real killer, but both of them are nabbed by the police, tried, convicted and sentenced: Guy to prison for a year, Heyward to be executed. It is revealed to the audience that Heyward's new wife Vivian (Frances Drake) and her lover, Al Mallon (Sidney Blackmer), are behind the whole thing. She stands to inherit Heyward's millions. In addition to her lover, the unfaithful woman discovers that her husband Ned Brown (George Meeker), an actor who she thought was dead, is still alive. Brown unexpectedly arrives from Australia and begins blackmailing her. On the way to jail, Guy comes across a clue: a newspaper personal ad from \\"Half a Dime\\" asking to be contacted at a certain location. Guy jumps from the moving train into a river, taking along the bumbling policeman handcuffed to him, Sergeant Fred Koretz (Nat Pendleton). His struggle with Koretz is witnessed by noted poet Edwina Corday (Claudette Colbert), who happens to be strolling near the river. After knocking Koretz out and freeing himself from the handcuffs, he has no choice but to kidnap Edwina to prevent her from sounding the alarm. At first, she believes him to be a dangerous criminal, but she soon discovers he is telling the truth about his mission. She then insists on sticking with him, much to his annoyance, as he conveys his low opinion regarding the intelligence of women. The trail eventually leads to a small theater group run by Madame Chambers (Cecil Cunningham) in Saugerties, New York. Guy gets himself hired as an actor to figure out who knows about the half dime. Guy brings in his associate, \\"Cap\\" Streeter (Guy Kibbee), to help with the investigation, only to have Edwina mistake him for a policeman and knock him out. Meanwhile, Vivian and Mallon decide it is better to silence her husband rather than submit to his demands. However, Mallon kills the wrong actor, a last-minute replacement, during a performance of What Price Glory?. Guy is arrested by the police, but Edwina tricks them into going to where Brown lives to look for a diary that supposedly implicates Guy in the first murder. When they drive to the address she gives, they catch Vivian and Mallon in the process of escaping with a bound and gagged Brown. As the police take away the true culprits, Guy recites a comical poem to Edwina professing his love for her and they embrace.

Thetis island is in size. It is approximately wide and long north to south. Two north to south land ridges define the east and west sides of the island. Burchell Hill is 591 feetabove sea level, and forms the high point on the west side of Thetis island, and Moore Hill is 585 feet above sea level, and forms the high point ridge on the east side of the island. Name origin The island was named in 1851 after HMS Thetis, a 36-gun Royal Navy frigate commanded by Captain Augustus Leopold Kuper (after whom Kuper Island was formerly named). The ship was named after the Nereid Thetis from Greek mythology. History Before contact, two Cowichan tribes inhabited Thetis Island, the Yekolaos and the Lilmalche. Thetis was first settled by Europeans in 1874 but permanent settlement took hold in the 1890s and 1900s. One of the early families on Thetis Island was the Hunter family. In 1891 Peter & Joseph Hunter purchased lot 27 from Mr. Walls, and then a couple of years later, lot 18 from Olaf Gustafson. Descendants of Peter Hunter continue to live on the northern coast of the island. Services Among the homes and seasonal cabins of Thetis Island are three Christian organizations: Capernwray Harbour Bible School, Pioneer Pacific Camp and formerly run Camp Columbia. There are also two marinas, Telegraph Harbour with a bistro and Thetis Island marina with a restaurant/pub, a small convenience store with post office, and several bed and breakfast on the island. Thetis Island also operates one of the few one- room schoolhouses left in Canada. Climate Thetis Island has a mild climate experiencing less rainfall than the western coast of Vancouver Island as it lies in the rain shadow of Vancouver Island. Vegetation on the island includes many arbutus, Douglas fir and western red cedar. Pilkey Point offers islanders and visitors a great view of the ocean and is a popular attraction.

Her accomplishments included scaling Mount Everest alone, without supplementary oxygen or support from a Sherpa team, in 1995. She soloed all the great north faces of the Alps in a single season—a first for any climber. This feat included climbing the difficult north face of the Eiger in the Alps, in 1988. Hargreaves also climbed Ama Dablam in Nepal. In 1995, Hargreaves intended to climb the three highest mountains in the world—Mount Everest, K2, and Kangchenjunga—unaided. On 13 May 1995, she reached the summit of Everest without the aid of Sherpas or bottled oxygen; on 13 August, she died while descending from the summit of K2.Alison Hargreaves Biographical entry from EverestNews.com Personal life Hargreaves grew up in Belper, Derbyshire and attended Belper High School. After leaving home at 18, she lived with and later married James Ballard, and in 1995 the family moved to Spean Bridge, in the Scottish Highlands, closer to conditions suitable for her training. She was six months pregnant with her first child, Tom, when she climbed the Eiger north face. Tom Ballard went on to become the first person to solo climb all of the six great north faces of the Alps in a single winter. He died in 2019 while ascending Nanga Parbat. K2 climb K2 In June 1995, Hargreaves joined an American team with a permit to climb K2. By 13 August 1995, the remnants of the US team, along with Hargreaves, had joined forces with a team from Canada and New Zealand at Camp 4, around above sea level, and at least 12 hours from the summit. Later that day, having joined with a Spanish team of mountaineers above Camp 4, New Zealander Peter Hillary, son of Everest pioneer Sir Edmund Hillary, decided to turn back, noting that the weather that had been fine for the previous four days appeared to be changing. At 6:45 pm, in fine conditions, Hargreaves and Spaniard Javier Olivar reached the summit, followed by American Rob Slater, Spaniards Javier Escartín and Lorenzo Ortíz, and New Zealander Bruce Grant. All six died in a violent storm while returning from the summit. Canadian Jeff Lakes, who had turned back below the summit earlier, managed to reach one of the lower camps but died from the effects of exposure. The next day, two Spanish climbers, Pepe Garces and Lorenzo Ortas, who had survived the storm at Camp 4, were descending the mountain while suffering from frostbite and exhaustion. Before reaching Camp 3, they found a bloodstained anorak, a climbing boot, and a harness. They recognized the equipment as belonging to Hargreaves. From Camp 3 they could also see a body in the distance. They did not approach the body, so it was not positively identified, but they had little doubt it was Hargreaves and concluded she had been blown off the mountain during the storm. After the incident, Captain Fawad Khan, the Pakistani army officer who was the team's intermediary with the rescue services, claimed that he had urged her not to climb beyond base camp because it would be \\"suicidal\\" in the deteriorating weather conditions.

These measures are to ensure that only authorized users are able to perform actions or access information in a network or a workstation. It is a subset of computer security.  Elements  Elements of logical security are: *User IDs, also known as logins, user names, logons or accounts, are unique personal identifiers for agents of a computer program or network that is accessible by more than one agent. These identifiers are based on short strings of alphanumeric characters, and are either assigned or chosen by the users. *Authentication is the process used by a computer program, computer, or network to attempt to confirm the identity of a user. Blind credentials (anonymous users) have no identity, but are allowed to enter the system. The confirmation of identities is essential to the concept of access control, which gives access to the authorized and excludes the unauthorized. *Biometrics authentication is the measuring of a user’s physiological or behavioral features to attempt to confirm his/her identity. Physiological aspects that are used include fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns, and hand measurements. Behavioral aspects that are used include signature recognition, gait recognition, speaker recognition and typing pattern recognition. When a user registers with the system which he/she will attempt to access later, one or more of his/her physiological characteristics are obtained and processed by a numerical algorithm. This number is then entered into a database, and the features of the user attempting to match the stored features must match up to a certain error rate. =Token Authentication= Token Authentication are small devices that authorized users of computer systems or networks carry to assist in identifying that who is logging into a computer or network system is actually authorized. They can also store cryptographic keys and biometric data. The most popular type of security token (RSA SecurID) displays a number which changes every minute. Users are authenticated by entering a personal identification number and the number on the token. The token contains a time of day clock and a unique seed value, and the number displayed is a cryptographic hash of the seed value and the time of day. The computer which is being accessed also contains the same algorithm and is able to match the number by matching the user’s seed and time of day. Clock error is taken into account, and values a few minutes off are sometimes accepted. Another similar type of token (Cryptogram) can produce a value each time a button is pressed. Other security tokens can connect directly to the computer through USB, Smart card or Bluetooth ports, or through special purpose interfaces. Cell phones and PDA's can also be used as security tokens with proper programming. =Password Authentication= Password Authentication uses secret data to control access to a particular resource. Usually, the user attempting to access the network, computer or computer program is queried on whether they know the password or not, and is granted or denied access accordingly. Passwords are either created by the user or assigned, similar to usernames. However, once assigned a password, the user usually is given the option to change the password to something of his/her choice. Depending on the restrictions of the system or network, the user may change his/her password to any alphanumeric sequence. Usually, limitations to password creation include length restrictions, a requirement of a number, uppercase letter or special character, or not being able to use the past four or five changed passwords associated with the username. In addition, the system may force a user to change his/her password after a given amount of time. = Two-Way Authentication = Two-Way Authentication involves both the user and system or network convincing each other that they know the shared password without transmitting this password over any communication channel. This is done by using the password as the encryption key to transmit a randomly generated piece of information, or “the challenge.” The other side must then return a similarly encrypted value which is some predetermined function of the originally offered information, his/her “response,” which proves that he/she was able to decrypt the challenge. Kerberos (a computer network authentication protocol) is a good example of this, as it sends an encrypted integer N, and the response must be the encrypted integer N + 1. Common setup and access rights Access Rights and Authority Levels are the rights or power granted to users to create, change, delete or view data and files within a system or network. These rights vary from user to user, and can range from anonymous login (Guest) privileges to Superuser (root) privileges. Guest and Superuser accounts are the two extremes, as individual access rights can be denied or granted to each user. Usually, only the system administrator (a.k.a. the Superuser) has the ability to grant or deny these rights. Guest accounts, or anonymous logins, are set up so that multiple users can log into the account at the same time without a password. Users are sometimes asked to type a username. This account has very limited access, and is often only allowed to access special public files. Usually, anonymous accounts have read access rights only for security purposes. The superuser is an authority level assigned to system administrators on most computer operating systems. In Unix and related operating systems, this level is also called root and has all access rights in the system, including changing ownership of files. In pre- Windows XP and NT systems (such as DOS and Windows 9x), all users are effectively superusers, and all users have all access rights. In Windows NT and related systems (such as Windows 2000 and XP), a superuser is known as the Administrator account. However, this Administrator account may or may not exist depending on whether separation up.

Born a free woman in the state of Massachusetts, she became an international activist for human rights and women's suffrage. Remond made her first public speech against the institution of slavery when she was 16 years old, and delivered abolitionist speeches throughout the northeastern United States. One of her brothers, Charles Lenox Remond, became known as an orator and they occasionally toured together for their abolitionist lectures. Eventually becoming an agent of the American Anti-Slavery Society, in 1858 Remond chose to travel to Britain to gather support for the growing abolitionist cause in the United States. While in London, Remond also studied at Bedford College, lecturing during term breaks. During the American Civil War, she appealed for support among the British public for the Union and their blockade of the Confederacy. After the conclusion of the war in favor of the Union, she appealed for funds to support the millions of the newly emancipated freedmen in the American South. From England, Remond went to Italy in 1867 to pursue medical training in Florence, where she became a physician. She practiced medicine for nearly 20 years in Italy and never returned to the United States, dying in Florence at the age of 68. Early years Born in Salem, Massachusetts, Remond was one of the between eight and eleven children of John Remond and Nancy (née Lenox) Remond. Nancy was born in Newton, daughter of Cornelius Lenox, a Revolutionary War veteran who had fought in the Continental Army, and Susanna Perry. John Remond was a free person of color who immigrated to Massachusetts from the Dutch colony of Curaçao as a ten-year old child in 1798. John and Nancy married in October 1807, in the African Baptist Church in Boston. In Salem, they built a successful catering, provisioning, and hairdressing business, becoming well- established businesspeople and activists. The Remonds tried to place their children in a private school, but they were rejected because of their race. When Sarah Remond and her sisters were accepted to a local high school for girls which was not segregated, they were expelled, as the school committee was planning to found a separate school for African American children. Remond later described the incident as engraved in her heart \\"like the scarlet letter of Hester.\\" In 1835, the Remond family moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where they hoped to find a less racist environment in which to educate their children. However, the schools refused to accept black students. Instead, some influential African Americans established a private school, where Remond was educated. In 1841, the Remond family returned to Salem. Sarah Remond continued her education on her own, attending concerts and lectures, and reading widely in books, pamphlets and newspapers borrowed from friends, or purchased from the anti-slavery society of her community, which sold many inexpensive titles. The Remond family also took in as boarders students who were attending the local girls' academy, including Charlotte Forten (later Grimké). Three of Remond's sisters built a business together: Cecilia (married to James Babcock), Maritchie Juan, and Caroline (married to Joseph Putnam), \\"owned the fashionable Ladies Hair Work Salon\\" in Salem, as well as the biggest wig factory in the state. Their oldest sister Nancy married James Shearman, an oyster dealer. The Remond brothers were Charles Remond, who became an abolitionist and orator; and John Remond, who married Ruth Rice, one of two women elected to the finance committee of the 1859 New England Colored Citizens' Convention. Anti-slavery activism and lecturing Salem in the 1840s was a center of anti-slavery activity, and the whole family was committed to the rising abolitionist movement in the United States. The Remonds' home was a haven for black and white abolitionists, and they hosted many of the movement's leaders, including William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips, and more than one fugitive slave fleeing north to freedom. John Remond was a life member of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. Sarah Remond's older brother Charles Lenox Remond was the first black lecturer of the American Anti-Slavery Society's and considered a leading black abolitionist. Nancy Remond was one of the founders of the Salem Female Anti- Slavery Society. Nancy not only taught her daughters the household skills of cooking and sewing but also to seek liberty lawfully; she wanted them to take part in society. With her mother and sisters, Sarah Remond was an active member of the state and county female anti-slavery societies, including the Salem Female Anti-Slavery Society, the New England Anti-Slavery Society, and the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. She also regularly attended antislavery lectures in Salem and Boston. With the support and financial backing of her family, Sarah Remond became an anti-slavery lecturer, delivering her first lecture against slavery at the age of 16, with her brother Charles in Groton, Massachusetts, in July 1842. Remond rose to prominence among abolitionists in 1853, when she refused to sit in a segregated theater section. She had bought tickets by post for herself and a group of friends, including historian William C. Nell, to the popular opera, Don Pasquale, at the Howard Athenaeum in Boston.\\"Sarah Parker Remond and the Remonds of Salem\\", Variety, Spice, Life, 20 July 2011. When they arrived at the theatre, Remond was shown to segregated seating. After refusing to accept it, she was forced to leave the theatre and pushed down some stairs. Remond sued for damages and won her case. She was awarded $500, and an admission by theatre management that she was wronged; the court ordered the theater to integrate all seating.May 4, 1853: Sarah Remond Ejected from Boston Theater In 1856, the American Anti-Slavery Society hired a team of lecturers, including Remond; Charles, already well known in the U.S. and Britain; and Susan B. Anthony, to tour New York State addressing anti-slavery issues. Over the next two years, she, her brother, and others also spoke in New York, Massachusetts, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. She and other African Americans were often given poor accommodation due to racial discrimination. Although inexperienced, Remond rapidly became an effective speaker. William Lloyd Garrison praised her \\"calm, dignified manner, her winning personal appearance and her earnest appeals to the conscience and the heart.\\" Sarah Clay wrote that Remond's every word \\"waked up dormant aspirations which would vibrate through the ages.\\" Over time, she became one of the society's most persuasive and powerful lecturers.\\"Remond at Bedford College in London\\", SARAH PARKER REMOND: A Daughter of Salem, Massachusetts, July 15, 2011. Abby Kelley Foster, a noted abolitionist in Massachusetts, encouraged Remond when they toured together in 1857. On December 28, 1858, Remond wrote in a letter to Foster:  Anti- slavery lecturing in Great Britain  Frederick Douglass, circa 1879. Remond and Douglass toured together in Britain. As a good speaker and fundraiser, Remond was invited to take the cause of the American abolitionists to Britain, as her brother Charles had done ten years earlier. Accompanied by the Reverend Samuel May, Jr., she sailed from Boston for Liverpool on December 28, 1858, on the steamer Arahia. They arrived in Liverpool on January 12, 1859, after a discomforting trip in the winter. The ship had become covered with ice and snow, and rolled and tossed so much that many of the passengers became ill, including Remond. At Tuckerman Institute on January 21, 1859, Remond gave her first antislavery lecture in England. Her second lecture, \\"Slave Life in America,\\" took place just a few days later on January 24. During these speeches, she spoke eloquently of the inhumane treatment of slaves in the United States, her stories shocking many of her listeners. She also described the discrimination endured by free blacks throughout the United States. Remond lectured to crowds in cities throughout the British Isles for the next three years, raising large sums of money for the anti-slavery cause. Between 1859 and 1861, she gave more than forty-five lectures in England, Ireland, and Scotland. Remond also appeared at times with Frederick Douglass. Although before she sailed, Remond expected to confront similar prejudice as what she encountered in the United States, writing Abby Kelly Foster that she feared not \\"the wind nor the waves, but I know that no matter how I go, the spirit of prejudice will meet me,\\" she met with a greater acceptance in Britain. \\"I have been received here as a sister by white women for the first time in my life,\\" she wrote; \\"I have received a sympathy I never was offered before.\\" Remond was praised for her speeches, in which she spoke out against slavery and racial discrimination, stressing the sexual exploitation of black women under slavery. Remond called on common themes found in sentimental fiction, such as family, womanhood, and marriage, to evoke an emotional response in her audience. During her tour of Ireland, she compared the plight of the African slave to the working-class laborers in her audience, worrying her middle and upper class sponsors. In her short autobiography, written in 1861, she observed that \\"prejudice against colour has always been the one thing, above all others, which has cast its gigantic shadow over my whole life.\\" Once the American Civil War (1861–65) began, Remond worked to build support in Britain for the Union blockade of the Confederacy and the Union cause. Because British textile factories relied heavily on American cotton from the Southern United States, Remond focused on this in her lectures. In an 1862 speech, she implored her London audience to \\"Let no diplomacy of statesmen, no intimidation of slaveholders, no scarcity of cotton, no fear of slave insurrections, prevent the people of Great Britain from maintaining their position as the friend of the oppressed negro.\\" Reprinted from The Journal of Negro History 27 (April 1942), pp. 216–18. After the conclusion of the Civil War, Remond changed her focus to lecture on behalf of the millions of freedmen in the United States, soliciting funds and clothing for them. She was an active member of the London Emancipation Society and the Freedman's Aid Association in London. Her lecture \\"The Freeman or the Emancipated Negro of the Southern States of the United States,\\" delivered in London, was published in The Freedman (London) in 1867. In the mid-1860s, Remond published a letter from London in the Daily News protesting that racial prejudice had worsened thanks to the efforts of planters in the West Indies and the American South. Education and later years Cimitero Acattolico in Rome. From October 1859 to June 1861, Remond undertook studies at Bedford College (later part of the University of London and now merged with Royal Holloway College). She studied classical academic subjects: French, Latin, English literature, music, history and elocution, continuing to give her own lectures during college vacations.Johnson Lewis, Jone, \\"Sarah Parker Remond, African American Abolitionist\\", ThoughtCo., September 16, 2017. During this period, she also traveled to Rome and Florence in Italy. Remond continued to be involved in abolitionist and feminist causes in Britain. She was a member first of the London Emancipation Committee, and then helped found and served on the executive committee of the Ladies' London Emancipation Society, which was organized in 1863. Remond is thought to be the only black woman\\"Women Writers and Italy: Two Englishwomen In Rome and Sarah Parker Remond\\", Woman And Her Sphere. who was among the 1500 signatories to a women-only, 1866 petition requesting the right of women to vote.Crawford, Elizabeth, \\"Women: From Abolition to the Vote  Women's suffrage campaign: 1866–1903\\", British History, BBC, June 20, 2011. Returning briefly to the U.S., Remond joined with the American Equal Rights Association working for equal suffrage for women and African Americans. Remond continued her studies at the London University College, graduating as a nurse. Then, at the age of 42 in 1867, she moved permanently to Florence. She entered the Santa Maria Nuova Hospital school as a medical student. At the time, the school was one of the most prestigious medical schools in Europe. After completing her studies and becoming a doctor, she remained in Florence. Remond practiced medicine for more than 20 years, never returning to the United States. Her sister Caroline and Maritcha joined her there from the United States. Frederick Douglass met the three women while visiting Italy in 1886.Coleman, Willie, \\"Remond, Sarah Parker (1824–1894)\\", BlackPast.org. In Italy, on April 25, 1877, Remond married Lazzaro Pintor (1833–1913), an Italian office worker originally from Sardinia. By the 1880s, Remond Pintor had moved to Rome. Remond died on December 13, 1894, in Rome. She is interred at the Protestant Cemetery in Rome. Tribute In 1999 the Massachusetts State House honored six outstanding women of the state by installing a series of six tall marble panels with a bronze bust in each; the busts are of Remond, Dorothea Dix, Florence Luscomb, Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, and Lucy Stone. Two quotations from each of these women are etched on their own marble panel. The wall behind the panels has wallpaper made of six government documents repeated over and over, with each document being related to a cause of one or more of the women. In 2020, the University College London renamed its Centre for the Study of Racism & Racialisation the Sarah Parker Remond Centre. The best-selling novel, La linea del colori: Il Grand Tour di Lafanu Brown, by Somalian Igiaba Scelgo (Florence: Giunti, 2020), in Italian, combines the characters of Edmonia Lewis and Sarah Parker Remond and is dedicated to Rome and to these two figures.

Early life Kane was born at 48 Henry Street, Dublin on 24 September 1809 to John and Eleanor Kean (née Troy). His father was involved in the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and fled for a time to France where he studied chemistry. Back in Dublin Kean (now Kane) founded the Kane Company and manufactured sulphuric acid. The young Kane studied chemistry at his father's factory, and attended lectures at the Royal Dublin Society as a teenager. He published his first paper in 1828, Observations on the existence of chlorine in the native peroxide of manganese, in the London Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature and Art. The following year, his description of the natural arsenide of manganese resulted in the compound being named Kaneite in his honour. He studied medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, graduating in 1834 whilst working in the Meath Hospital. He was appointed Professor of Chemistry at the Apothecaries' Hall, Dublin in 1831, which earned him the moniker of the \\"boy professor\\". In the following year he participated in the founding of the Dublin Journal of Medical Science. Academic lifeChemistry= On the strength of his book Elements of Practical Pharmacy he was elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 1832. He studied acids, showed that hydrogen was electropositive, and proposed the existence of the ethyl radical. In 1836 he travelled to Gießen in Germany to study organic chemistry with Justus von Liebig. In 1843 he was awarded the Royal Irish Academy's Cunningham Medal for his work on the nature and constitution of compounds of Ammonia. He published a three-volume Elements of Chemistry in 1841–1844, and a detailed report on the Industrial Resources of Ireland. This included the first assessment of the water power potential of the River Shannon, which was not realised until the 1920s at Ardnacrusha. =Great Famine of Ireland= He became a political adviser on scientific and industrial matters. He served on several commissions to enquire into the Great Famine of Ireland along with Professors Lindley and Taylor, all more or less ineffective. His political and administrative work meant that his contribution to chemistry ceased after about 1844. =Educational work= His work on Irish industry led to his being appointed director of the Museum of Irish Industry in Dublin in 1845. The Museum was a successor to the Museum of Economic Geology, and was housed at 51 St Stephen's Green. Also in 1845 he became the first President of Queen's College, Cork (now University College Cork). He did not spend a lot of time in Cork as he had work in Dublin, and his wife lived there. The science building on the campus of this college (now University College Cork) is named in honour of Kane. He was knighted in 1846. In 1873 Kane took up the post of National Commissioner for Education. He was elected president of the Royal Irish Academy in 1877, holding the role until 1882. In 1880 he was appointed the first chancellor of the newly created Royal University of Ireland. After a motion to admit women to the University, put forward by Prof. Samuel Haugton at Academic Council in Trinity College Dublin, 10 March 1880, Kane was appointed to a committee of 10 men to look into the matter. He was opposed to the admission of women, and nothing was reported from the committee in the Council minutes for the next 10 years (Parkes, 2004). Family Kane married Katherine Sophia Baily on 23 August 1838, with whom he had seven surviving children. Kane's eldest son Robert Romney Kane was known as a barrister. The second son, Henry Coey Kane, became an admiral in the Royal Navy. Bibliography *Kane, R.J. (1831) Elements of Practical Pharmacy, Dublin : Hodges & Smith *Kane, R.J.

The word has long been used by Jewish-Americans and in the regional speech of New York City and elsewhere. It is Slavic in origin. The word may also refer to free promotional items dispensed at trade shows, conventions, and similar commercial events. They can also be sold as cheap souvenirs in tourist areas, which are sometimes called \\"tchotchke shops\\". Spelling A wide variety of spellings exist for the English usage of the term, e.g., tshotshke, tshatshke, tchachke, tchotchka, tchatchka, chachke, tsotchke, chotski, or chochke; the standard Yiddish transliteration is tsatske or tshatshke. In YIVO standard orthography, it is spelled טשאַטשקע. In Israeli Hebrew it is often spelled , , with a tsade instead of teth-shin, as in Yiddish. A Hebrew variant is צ׳אצ׳קע, using צ (tsade) with a single apostrophe (usually called a chupchik, or geresh in more formal parlance). Alternative meanings and context Depending on context, the term has a connotation of worthlessness or disposability as well as tackiness.\\"Inside the Bernie Madoff Tchotchke Auction\\" , Gawker A common confusion is between the terms tchotchke and tsatske or rather tsatskele, with the diminutive ending -le. Both terms have the same Slavic root, but the tch- version stems from Russian, while the ts- originates in Polish. Tchotchke usually references trinkets, while tsatskele is more likely to mean a young girl or woman who uses her charms in order to reach her goals. Being Yiddish, the meaning can change by the use of gestures and a change in tone, so that tsatskele can become the favorite child. Leo Rosten, author of The Joys of Yiddish, combines the two main meanings and gives an alternative sense of tchotchke as meaning a desirable young girl, a \\"pretty young thing\\". Less flatteringly, the term could be construed as a more dismissive synonym for \\"bimbo\\", or \\"slut\\". Illustrated, reprint edition. Etymology The word tchotchke derives from a Slavic word for \\"trinket\\" ( ; , plural ; J. Kačala et al.: Short Dictionary of Slovak Language. Veda, 2003.

History Susperia was started by Tjodalv (Dimmu Borgir, Old Man's Child) and Cyrus (Satyricon, Old Man's Child) in October 1998. After Tjodalv left Dimmu Borgir in the middle of March 1999 he started to concentrate fully on Susperia together with old-time friend Cyrus. At Wacken Open Air Festival in 1999, Tjodalv met with singer Athera (Vanaheim), who joined the band subsequently, followed by bass player Memnock (Old Man's Child, Vanaheim) and guitarist Elvorn. They recorded a demo, Illusions of Evil, in December 1999 at Pitfire Studio outside Oslo, which was mixed and mastered by L. Argedick. Synthesizer and piano parts were played by Mustis (Dimmu Borgir). He was briefly an official member of the band before he left to fully concentrate on Dimmu Borgir. Mustis returned to the band in 2010, after being fired from Dimmu Borgir. Susperia in Vigo (Spain) The demo was sent out to different record companies and gained some positive feedback. They received a few offers from mainly major record labels, and signed in early 2000 with Nuclear Blast for four records. Susperia played their first live gig at John Dee in Oslo, following Ragnarok and Alsvartr; just a few months later they played at the Scream Magazine 10 year anniversary party. Susperia is not a Satanic band, though their lyrics tend to criticize and question the views and morals of Christianity. On March 9, 2009, it was reported that vocalist Athera (real name Pål Mathisen) had suffered a heart attack. It was later confirmed that he had been rushed into hospital in Lørenskog, Norway, suffering from acute stomach pain and heavy bleeding. He was expected to remain hospitalised for some time. It was later announced that he would undergo a triple bypass operation on March 16, 2009. Cyrus is currently the touring bassist for Dimmu Borgir. Susperia joined Melodi Grand Prix in 2011, but lost before the semi final. They are currently recording an EP with Mustis (Ex-Dimmu Borgir) joining them on keyboards.

It is the capital of the Anosy Region and of the Tôlanaro District. It has been a port of local importance since the early 1500s, and a new port, the Ehoala Port, has been built by QMM and the World Bank. Formerly Fort-Dauphin, it was the first French settlement in Madagascar.  Location  Tôlañaro was initially situated on a short, narrow peninsula on the extreme southeastern coast of Madagascar. It has since grown to cover a much greater area along the ocean, almost to Mount Bezavona.  Climate  Tôlanaro has a tropical rainforest climate, though it is less rainy than areas further north on the eastern Malagasy coast. Being closer to the centre of the subtropical anticyclones than other parts of Madagascar, most rainfall is orographic, and tropical cyclones are not as common as in more northerly parts of the island.  History  Plan of the fort from 1650 The bay of Tolanaro was found by a Portuguese Captain in 1500. Fort Dauphin was founded on an Antanosy village, Taolankarana, in 1643 by the French East India Company who built a fort there named in honor of the crown prince, the future Louis XIV of France. It was settled by around a hundred colonists, who found themselves involved in the local politics. The poor trade results (some ebony and little more was obtained) hardly justified the difficulties of the settlers, who suffered from tropical illnesses and other problems. After a conflict with the Antanosy people, the survivors were evacuated in 1674. One Governor of this colony, Étienne de Flacourt, published the History of the Great Isle of Madagascar and Relations, which was the main source of information on the island for Europeans until the late 19th century.Ramangalahy, Pasteur. (2004). L’Histoire de Fort Dauphin. SIT Lecture Notes. After World War II and until Didier Ratsiraka took the presidency in 1975, Fort Dauphin had a thriving community of Malagasy, French, Chinese and Pakistani merchants with adequate roads connecting the city to Toliara to the west and Fianarantsoa to the west and then north. The port provided a means of exporting cattle to Mauritius and importing various goods from France and elsewhere. During the time Philibert Tsiranana was President of Madagascar, he enjoyed flying down to Fort Dauphin to stay in a villa above Libanona beach. In 1975, the French businesses were nationalized, French citizens’ assets were frozen and several were briefly imprisoned. Fort Dauphin was the headquarters of American Lutheran missionaries American Lutheran Church who worked in southern Madagascar (see Malagasy Lutheran Church) starting in 1888 for almost 100 years. They were engaged in community development, education, evangelism and medical work and also operated what was known as the \\"American School\\" and the \\"Missionary Children's Home\\" (MCH). The school is now a Maternelle and the MCH is the Mahavoky Hotel. In 1959 about 25 American Lutheran missionary families and quite a few single missionaries were living in over 20 towns in an area that ran roughly from Fort Dauphin northeast to Manantenina, west to Ranomafana, northwest to Tsivory, north to Betroka southwest to Betioky and southwest to St. Augustine. When the number of students seeking a US education in Madagascar on the island declined rapidly in the late 1970s, the school briefly moved to operate alongside an NMS school in Antsirabe in the mid-1980s until finally the very few remaining students began attending the American School in Antananarivo in the 1990s. American missionary families and other English-speaking families in Madagascar (including kids from other missionary organizations, NASA, and US Embassy employees living in Antananarivo) and for a time, even East Africa, sent their children to this boarding school. While most of the students were from the US, there were also Malagasy, Canadian and Norwegian students who went to this school, which from the 1960s to the end of the 1970s averaged 50 to 60 students per year in grades 1–12. Notable alumni include Dr. Carl Braaten, a noted Lutheran Theologian and co-founder of the Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology and the theological journal Pro Ecclesia, Arndt Braaten, a pastor and professor at Luther College, David Brancaccio of the PBS NOW program, Dr. Peter Dyrud, Minneapolis Cardiologist, Dr. Pier Larson, Professor of African History, Johns Hopkins Dr. Pier Larson and Dr. Stan Quanbeck, medical missionary to Madagascar for 40 years. The Lutheran missionaries also traded land above the original Fort Dauphin harbor for what was then a sand dune, which became Libanona where the cottages on top of the hill were built as a place for R&R; and to live while they were visiting their children at the school. There is also a section of the town's cemetery where quite a few American Lutheran missionaries and several others are buried.Vigen, James B. (1991).

Since the early 1970s, Fort Dauphin suffered an economic decline due to lack of good road connections to the rest of the country, rendering its port of local importance only. This in spite of significant foreign exchange earned from the export of live lobster (250 to over 350 tonnes per year from 1990 to 2005),Sabatini, Gino et al. (2008).

Tourists have not yet returned in any significant numbers. The Anosy area around Tolagnaro is currently undergoing a massive transformation associated with the development of a new ilmenite mine by the QIT Madagascar Minerals company (a subsidiary of the Rio Tinto Group) in the area. A new port at Ehoala, just west of Tolagnaro Port d'Ehoala as well as new roads and a variety of mining facilities and housing for mine workers have been built at the cost of almost US$1 billion. These are the first major investments in the region's infrastructure for many decades. (For a history of this project as well as its social and environmental concepts, seeVincelette, Manon et al. (2008). The QMM/Rio Tinto project history in Tolagnaro and its social and environmental concepts.). The mine is controversial however due to anticipated social upheaval, creation of a parallel economy and adverse environmental impacts, some of which have begun to manifest.PANOS London. (2009). Pushed to the edge. Health officials also fear HIV/AIDS, which to date has been almost unknown in Madagascar, could spread to the island via foreigners working on the mine and its construction projects. Rio Tinto Alcan is also interested in mining an estimated 100 million tons of bauxite located near Manantenina which is approximately 100 km northeast of Tolagnaro.Alcan. (2009).

In sailing back north to rejoin his fleet, on August 10 he and his crew become the first Europeans to see Madagascar, somewhere near what was to become Fort Dauphin in Anosy. Dias named the island São Lourenço (Saint-Laurent in French) in honor of the Feast of São Lourenço held on that day. *1506 – Fernando Soares, a Portuguese explorer sailing back to Portugal from India, sailed past what was to become Fort Dauphin (now Tolagnaro) harbor. While his ship was hit by lightning during his passage, he didn't anchor there. *1508 – Captain Diogo Lopes de Sequeira of Portugal, faced with a storm while off the coast of Anosy, sought shelter behind a small peninsula which provided an anchorage that was well protected by the wind. Here they were also able to buy cattle, wild boar, yams and rice from the local Malagasy, who they found to be very friendly. This site was called Taolanara, and became a stopping off point for European ships on their way to and from India. = 17th century = Initial French attempt to set up a Colony in Fort Dauphin, Anosy (1642–1674) = *1642 – First French colonial settlement in Anosy established by the French East India Company at Manafiafy, on the coast 40 km. northeast of Tolagnaro. *1643 – After 26 of the 40 settlers died within the first several months in Manafiafy, the French settlement was moved to a peninsula overlooking what was known as the Tolanaro bay and was named Fort Dauphin. *1645?- Pronis, Fort Dauphin's commander, married Ramaka's niece, cementing trade relationships. *1646 – Mutiny by the settlers when Ramaka's family made the colony's stores their own. Pronis was held captive for 6 months, only released at the insistence of those on a passing Societe ship. * Pronis seriously strained relationships with local Antanosy by killing a local roandria (prince)and enslaving 73 Malagasy he tricked into coming into the fort and then gave to the captain of the ship which had gotten him released. Governor Pronis sent 12 Frenchmen who had mutinied against him, together with several Malagsy women, to exile on Réunion, where they became the first foreign residents of that island. *1648 – Etienne de Flacourt arrived to become governor of Fort Dauphin, a post he held until 1655. One of his recommendations was the importance of mixed marriages in the colony's development. For a map of Anosy at this time created by Flacourt see.Flacourt, S. de (1656). Map of Anosy. (There is a second map of Anosy created by Madave (1768).) For his map of Fort Dauphin, see.Flacourt, S. de. (mid-1650s). Map of Fort Dauphin. * First Lazarist missionaries, sent from France by St. Vincent de Paul, also arrived in Fort Dauphin. What they found was a Colony which was quite a few less in number than had originally arrived due to deaths from malaria, dysentery and warfare. * As it was 5 years before the next Societe ship arrived and due to poor relationships with local inhabitants, Flacourt began to conduct cattle raids in Anosy. As his troops were the only ones armed with muskets, they also were requested to help settle local feuds. *1650 – For what Fort Dauphin looked like per Flacourt at this point in time, see the map above under \\"History.\\" *1653 – Flacourt reinscribed the marble stone the Portuguese had used to mark their captain's grave at the Trano Vato and brought it back to Fort Dauphin. On the marble he reinscribed, \\"Oh newcomer, read our advice: it will be useful for you, yours and your life: beware of the locals. Farewell.\\" *1655 – Flacourt returned to France for 5 years. * Most of Fort Dauphin burned down during festivities celebrating the return of Governor Ponis. * Two additional Catholic missionaries died as did three new ones who were en route from France. *1656 – Champmargou, Flacourt's replacement, arrived at Fort Dauphin to find the French had executed two roandria, but the Fort was burnt and Pronis was dead. In response Champmargou leads a ruthless attempt to conquer the local Antanosy, which only left those living at the Fort more isolated. *1658 – Flacourt's Histoire de la Grande Isle Madagascar is published for the first time in Paris. *1660 – Flacourt died during his return from Paris to Fort Dauphin when his ship was sunk by Corsairs. *1660s – While thousands of new colonists and troops arrived as part of the new Compagnie des Indes Orientales' efforts to rebuild Fort Dauphin, many in turn die from warfare and fever. However, the Compagnie's poor profits result to the Crown taking it over. *1663 – On Christmas Day, 4 adults and 15 children were baptized, but another Catholic missionary died soon thereafter. *1665–67 – By the time 9 new Catholic missionaries, 4 lay brothers and 2 Recollet farmers arrived in Fort Dauphin, it had a chapel, monastery and library. *1668 – Fort described as having two \\"bastions\\" on the north side which commanded the harbor, was 50 feet long by 26 feet wide with a main door which overlooked s small meadow to the west while the other door looked east towards the sea. *1670 – 200 remaining colonists left at Fort Dauphin living in a war-torn, hostile part of Anosy. *1671 – Death of La Case. Both his daughter and widow married other Frenchmen. * Admiral de la Haye told King Louis XIV he should abandon Fort Dauphin. *1672 – In October the Dunkuerquoise anchored in Fort Dauphin's harbor, carrying amongst other things ?? French women who were being sent to Reunion to become wives of the French settlers there. They jumped ship, however, and were soon all married to the French settlers, who in turn divorced their Malagasy wives. This soured relationships with the Antanosy to the point that at midnight of Christmas that year, over half the French colony was massacred. The rest of the colony was either already in or fled to the fort where they stayed until a ship came to rescue them. *1674 – In September, almost two years later, the White Pigeon, a company ship, arrived and evacuated all the surviving settlers to Reunion. *1675 – A ship stopped at Fort Dauphin to find the settlement in ashes. * French King Louis XIV decided to abandon the colony which by then over 30 years had resulted in about 4,000 French deaths (and most likely even more Malagasy) and cost its shareholders 10 million livres (over 1/7 the cost of what it took to build the Versailles Palace). * While only 2 of a total of 37 French Catholic missionaries sent to Fort Dauphin by that time were able to return to France, by the time they left there were hundreds of baptized Antanosy, a French-Antanosy dictionary and a Catechism in the Antanosy language left behind. * Fort Dauphin considered too dangerous a port to be used by the French for the next 60 years. *1697 – Abraham Samuel, Indian Ocean Pirate, a runaway mulatto slave from Martinique, whose pirate ship washed ashore in Fort Dauphin bay, occupied the abandoned fort and is identified by a local princess as the child she had borne to a Frenchman during the occupancy of the colony. Thus he is declared heir to the vacant throne of the kingdom, became king Samuel and, together with at least 45 other pirates, some who served as his bodyguards, he conducted both piracy of ships stopping in the harbor and engaged in warfare with a neighboring Antanosy kingdom after claiming rule over the old heartland of the Zafiraminy. This pirate settlement rivaled that of St. Mary for a brief period of time. = 18th century = *1705 – Samuel's kingdom ends with his death. *1706 – A Dutch captain is unable to find out what happened to Abraham Samuel from the local Antanosy king. *1730 – Pirate Olivier Levasseur was captured near Fort Dauphin, taken to Reunion and hanged. *1745–61 – Fort Dauphin a Compagnie des Indes outpost. *1766–70 – A French naval officer reestablished a colony at Fort Dauphin, including an attempted agricultural concession at Fenoarivo???. In 1769 he introduced prickly pear cactus from Mexico to Fort Dauphin to protect the seaward side of the Fort from pirates and strong storms. In the next century it spread across southern Madagascar, as it became very popular as a way to enclose and protect both cattle and villages. = 19th century = *1804 – French colony again at Fort Dauphin??? *1818 – French post reestablished at Fort Dauphin. = Imerina Control of Fort Dauphin & some of the surrounding area (1825–1895) = *1825 – After Anosy was conquered by 4,000 Imerina soldiers, they entered the French garrison at Fort Dauphin where they tore down the French flag and raised the Imerina King Radama I's instead. The 5 French soldiers and 1 officer who were at the fort fled to an island off Manafiafy where they were rescued and sent to Isle St. Marie. *Imerina begin to extract taxes from the people living in Anosy. F * Fort Dauphin had 800 Hova and some Sakalava troops for some time. * Imerina occupation of parts of Anosy resulted in some of the Antanosy people moving west to the Onilahy valley near Bezaha. *1852 – A six-month siege of Fort Dauphin by the Antanosy was finally broken by Imerina reinforcements sent by Lambert who broke through to the town. *1869 – Ranovalona II, Queen of the Imerina, became a Christian, requiring her representatives around the country to build churches. Some time after this a church was built in Fort Dauphin by the Imerina living there, who eventually made attendance mandatory for those living in Fort Dauphin. *1880 – Two Malagasy Christian evangelists were sent by the London Mission Society south to Anosy where they began to work with the church there, eventually taking over leadership of it. *1888 – Having spent over 6 weeks travelling overland from Antananarivo, American Rev. John and Lena Hogstad, at that time sponsored by the Norwegian Mission Society (NMS), arrived in Fort Dauphin, accompanied by the Rev. Nilsen-Lund of the NMS, who helped them with their journey and to settle there before he left. * Rev. Hogstad and his wife began work on establishing a Lutheran church in Fort Dauphin (work which eventually expanded to encompass all of Anosy, Androy and the Mahafaly regions), with significant numbers of American Lutheran pastors, evangelists, educators and medical staff working in southern Madagascar and eventually in the north and nationally as well for the next 100 years). * Having been sent with the blessing of the Queen of Imerina, they were asked to start working with an existing Imerina congregation located just outside the fort which was located in the midst of where the Imerina lived. While they were supported by the Imerina Governor in these efforts, this support meant they were at least initially viewed as collaborators with the hated Imerina by the people of Anosy. *1889 – First 7 Antanosy youth baptized by Rev. Hogstad. Shortly thereafter the Hogstads began a Lutheran primary school, purchasing the liberation of Rabenjamina, a young local slave who'd been taught how to read and write in Antananarivo, who became the first teacher at this school. Before long Hogstad had also started an evangelist training school (though 8 of the 10 first students were either Betsileo or Imerina). *1890s – Over 1,500 tonnes of Caoutchouc (natural rubber) collected in Anosy region exported to Europe from Fort Dauphin. Some of it is used in the first tires made by Michelin. *1890 – French explorer Louis Catat described Fort Dauphin as follows: \\"On the peninsula that made up Fort Dauphin, there rose the fort and the French citadel: it covered an area measuring about a square kilometer and was situated on the flat part of the peninsula that sat on top of the cliffs... Landing there was absolutely impossible because of the high cliffs and on the ground the only place that natives might access had been protected by digging moats, raising walls and forming artillery posts in the shape of a circle, all of which made for a first class defense system. Thus for the natives the military post at Fort Dauphin was an impenetrable citadel... But all of that was abandoned and ... no one seems in a real hurry to redress this unfortunate event. With each step, behind almost every hut, one finds some heartbreaking memory of our former domination. To the north, outside of the former borders (of the Fort) rose the village of Fort Dauphin, an important settlement which counts about 200 huts.\\"Walker, W.M. (2001).

Longmans, Green. a reporter from The Times, who was sneaking into Madagascar to report on the French attempts to conquer the island. He described Fort Dauphin as a \\"little town of thatched huts [which] nestles in verdure; while on a bluff commanding the sea stands the old French fort, built at the time of their first occupation, in 1646—a strong place in its day, whose ruined walls surround the residence of the Hova Governor and the ill- equipped arsenal\\" (p. 10). He later described the town's streets as \\"narrow...bordered by little stalls\\" with no native art for sale, only \\"cheap hardware of Europe, cloth from America, native-made implements, pottery...fruits and vegetables\\" (p. 17). Most of the Antanosy men only wore a loin-cloth, some of them armed with both a shield and a spear. On the other hand, some of the Imerina people wore European dress while most wore a white \\"lamba\\" (shawl) and a broad-brimmed high-crowned Imerina hat. * By this time the Fort Dauphin garrison had only 100 \\"listless and very unsoldierly-looking Hova soldiers, armed with rusty Sniders\\" and \\"was isolated and surrounded by enemies on all sides,\\" their nearest Hova post 150 miles up the coast to the north (p. 13) in Vangaindrano, with the people in Anosy in open rebellion to Imerina rule. The town's French-owned stores had been pillaged.

High school courses were added to the curriculum in 1930. *1926 – Cyclone severely damaged the government hospital. *1928 – Henry de Heaulme arrived in Fort Dauphin, having driven down from Tananarive in a Harley Davidson motorcycle with his wife and baby son in the side car. He established an office in Fort Dauphin with the intent to export mica and sisal from western Anosy (and eventually eastern Androy as well) through Fort Dauphin. *1940 – Vichy France took over control of Madagascar. * Mica exported from Fort Dauphin initially to Axis then to Allied countries. *1942 – In the Battle of Madagascar British forces replace Vichy France's control of Madagascar with that of the Free French, which included landing British soldiers in Fort Dauphin. With Free French in control of Madagascar, the Swiss Jenny family is imprisoned in Fort Dauphin and M.

He died in prison in Tananarive. *1947 – Short-lived attack in Fort Dauphin at the start of the Malagasy rebellion against the French. MDRM members living in Fort Dauphin were arrested and tortured by French authorities during this time. While many of the foreigners in Fort Dauphin slept either in the heavily guarded Jenny house or at the fort due to fear of an attack by rebels, this never happened. * The French de Heaulme and Silva and Swiss Jenny families requested Catholic brothers in Tananarive to open a school for Malagasy teenage boys in Fort Dauphin, but this was turned down due to a lack of teachers. *1950s–60s – Boetchi (Swiss), de Heaulme and Jenny families and the Lyonnaise and Marseillaise companies exported wild Castor Oil beans, cattle (10–30,000/year), lumber (over 1,000 m3/year, most of it hardwood), mica and sisal through Fort Dauphin port. *1956 – First Lycee built in Fort Dauphin, but due to what had historically been poor education in the area, only 30 students qualified for entry, even though the school was equipped to handle 400. *1957 – Construction of the SIFOR sisal weaving factory just outside Fort Dauphin. *1958 – Henri de Heaulme becomes president of the Provincial Assembly and vice-president of the National Assembly, urging independence for Madagascar.

It is a physical and chemical phenomenon. The photovoltaic effect is closely related to the photoelectric effect. In either case, light is absorbed, causing excitation of an electron or other charge carrier to a higher-energy state. The main distinction is that the term photoelectric effect is now usually used when the electron is ejected out of the material (usually into a vacuum) and photovoltaic effect used when the excited charge carrier is still contained within the material. In either case, an electric potential (or voltage) is produced by the separation of charges, and the light has to have a sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier for excitation. The physical essence of the difference is usually that photoelectric emission separates the charges by ballistic conduction and photovoltaic emission separates them by diffusion, but some \\"hot carrier\\" photovoltaic device concepts blur this distinction. The first demonstration of the photovoltaic effect, by Edmond Becquerel in 1839, used an electrochemical cell. He explained his discovery in Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences, \\"the production of an electric current when two plates of platinum or gold immersed in an acid, neutral, or alkaline solution are exposed in an uneven way to solar radiation.\\" The first solar cell, consisting of a layer of selenium covered with a thin film of gold, was experimented by Charles Fritts in 1884, but it had a very poor efficiency. However, the most familiar form of the photovoltaic effect uses solid-state devices, mainly in photodiodes. When sunlight or other sufficiently energetic light is incident upon the photodiode, the electrons present in the valence band absorb energy and, being excited, jump to the conduction band and become free. These excited electrons diffuse, and some reach the rectifying junction (usually a diode p-n junction) where they are accelerated into the p-type semiconductor material by the built-in potential (Galvani potential). This generates an electromotive force and an electrical current, and thus some of the light energy is converted into electric energy. The photovoltaic effect can also occur when two photons are absorbed simultaneously in a process called two-photon photovoltaic effect. Besides from the direct excitation of free electrons, a photovoltaic effect can arise simply due to the heating caused by absorption of the light. The heating leads to increased temperature of the semiconductor material, which is accompanied by temperature gradients. These thermal gradients in turn may generate a voltage through the Seebeck effect. Whether direct excitation or thermal effects dominate the photovoltaic effect will depend on many material parameters. All above effects generate direct current, the first demonstration of the alternating current photovoltaic effect (AC PV) was done by Dr. Haiyang Zou and Prof. Zhong Lin Wang at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2017. The AC PV effect is the generation of alternating current (AC) in the nonequilibrium states when the light periodically shines at the junction or interface of material. The AC PV effect is based on the capacitive model that the current strongly depends on the frequency of the chopper. The AC PV effect is suggested to be a result of the relative shift and realignment between the quasi-Fermi levels of the semiconductors adjacent to the junction/interface under the nonequilibrium conditions. The electron flow in the external circuit back and forth to balance the potential difference between two electrodes. The organic solar cell, which the materials have no initial carrier concentration, does not have the AC PV effect. In most photovoltaic applications the radiation is sunlight, and the devices are called solar cells. In the case of a semiconductor p-n (diode) junction solar cell, illuminating the material creates an electric current because excited electrons and the remaining holes are swept in different directions by the built-in electric field of the depletion region.The photovoltaic effect. Scienzagiovane.unibo.it (2006-12-01). Retrieved on 2010-12-12.the AC PV is operated at the non- equilibrium conditions. The first study was based on a p-Si/TiO2 nanofilm. It is found that except for the DC output generated by the conventional PV effect based on a p-n junction, AC current is also produced when a flashing light is illuminated at the interface. The AC PV effect does not follow Ohm's law, being based on the capacitive model that the current strongly depends on the frequency of the chopper, but voltage is independent of the frequency. The peak current of AC at high switching frequency can be much higher than that from DC. The magnitude of the output is also associated with the light absorption of materials.

The picture was directed by Andrew V. McLaglen. The American folk song \\"Oh Shenandoah\\" features prominently in the film's soundtrack. Though set during the Civil War, the film's strong antiwar and humanitarian themes resonated with audiences in later years as attitudes began to change against the Vietnam War. Upon its release, the film was praised for its themes as well as its technical production. Plot In the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1864, during the Civil War, family patriarch Charlie Anderson (James Stewart) and his six sons Jacob, John, James, Nathan, Henry, and Boy (who is 16) run the family farm, while his daughter Jennie (Rosemary Forsyth) and daughter-in-law Ann (Katharine Ross) take care of the housework. The family has no slaves. Though Charlie attends church weekly and considers himself a \\"God fearing\\" man, he doesn't give God credit for anything, but takes credit for himself especially during dinner prayer. He internally blames God for taking his wife from him. His family is constantly late for church and will force people out of their seats to make room for his family, much to the annoyance of the preacher and congregation. Charlie's oldest son Jacob (Glenn Corbett) wants to join the war, but Charlie repeatedly tells his family that they won't join the war until it concerns them. Although a few of the boys want to join, they respect their father's wishes and remain on the farm. Charlie's daughter Jennie is courted by a young Confederate officer named Sam (Doug McClure). He wants to marry Jennie, and when Charlie gives his permission, the wedding occurs a few days later. As soon as the vows are said, a corporal rides up and announces that Sam is wanted back immediately. Sam leaves, much to the sorrow of his new bride. Shortly after Sam leaves, Ann then goes into labor, giving birth to a baby girl whom they name Martha in honor of Charlie's late wife. While out hunting raccoon, Charlie's youngest son Boy (Phillip Alford) and his friend Gabriel (Eugene Jackson Jr.) stumble onto a Confederate ambush. They run away and stop for a drink at a pond. Boy is wearing an old rebel soldier kepi cap that he found at the river. When a Union patrol comes on them, they take Boy as a prisoner of war, mistakenly thinking he is a rebel soldier. Gabriel runs to tell the Andersons what happened. When Charlie hears the news, he and his sons and daughter Jennie leave to look for Boy, leaving James (Patrick Wayne) and his wife Ann at the farm with their young baby. The first place the Andersons look is a Union camp. They are told there are no prisoners there, but Colonel Fairchild (George Kennedy), who also has a sixteen-year-old son, directs them to a possible location, where Confederate prisoners are shipped North via railroad. However, the captain in charge refuses to allow Charlie to look through the cars, as he \\"has schedules to keep\\". So Charlie sets up a roadblock, then disarms the Union guards and sends them away. He looks through the boxcars, but Boy is not there, so he mounts his horse to leave. As he looks up, he sees Sam coming through the crowd. Jennie is overjoyed to see her husband. Sam leaves with the Andersons, telling the soldiers to burn the train and go home knowing there's no chance of winning the war. After being taken to a different prisoner of war camp, Boy is befriended by rebel soldier Carter (James Best), who plans to escape and decides to let Boy come along. They and a few other men successfully make it out of the camp and start heading south. Coming onto a Confederate camp, their unit is attacked by the Federals. Carter is killed, and Boy is shot in the leg. A Union soldier almost kills him, but it turns out to be his friend, Gabriel who has joined the Union Army. Gabriel helps him hide in a bush until after the battle. Back at the farm, scavengers raid the place, killing James and it's suggested that Ann was raped before she was killed too. On their way home, the Andersons run across a Confederate unit guarding the road. A young sentry, startled by the sound of horses, takes a shot at Jacob, killing him instantly. Charlie starts to strangle the sentry, but stops to ask him his age. The sentry replies, \\"Sixteen, sir.\\" Charlie, remembering that his youngest son is sixteen, emotionally tells the sentry that he wants him to live and be an old man and have many sons. He wants him to know what it feels like to lose one of them. When the Andersons return home, the doctor tells them what happened to James and Ann. Their child Martha is still alive, with the black woman acting as her nanny, and Charlie takes her in his arms. Next day at the breakfast table, Charlie begins his standard prayer, but is so heartbroken that he can't finish it. He goes out to the family graveyard to see his wife's grave. He sees the graves of James, Jacob and Ann alongside hers, and he hears church bells ringing in the distance. At the farmhouse, he demands to know why no one told him it was Sunday. The whole family gets dressed and ready for church, arriving as the singing begins. As the congregation completes the first song, the pastor (Denver Pyle) starts to announce the next hymn. Boy stumbles through the back door on a crutch. The whole congregation looks, and Charlie Anderson turns to see what is happening. His face lights up, and he helps his son to the pew. Everyone joyously sings in unison as the story ends.

Under the overly detailed direction of Andrew V. McLaglen, it hits and hangs onto many a static snag.\\"Thompson, Howard (July 29, 1965). \\"Civil War Drama\\". The New York Times. 18. Variety stated that \\"the Technicolor film, despite a neuter title, packs drama, excitement and an emotional quality certain National Parks particularly reflected in the climax — which should find better-than-average reception in the general market ... Stewart, seldom without a cigar butt in the corner of his mouth, endows his grizzled role with a warm conviction.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Shenandoah\\". Variety. April 14, 1965. 6. Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a curious film for this day and age, a kind of anachronistic throwback to the bucolic ... Nevertheless, it serves as a reminder of homely virtues and homilies, as spoken, mostly, by James Stewart. He creates a unique character and sustains it convincingly through stress and tragic change.\\"Scheuer, Philip K. (July 22, 1965). \\"'Shenandoah' Full of Homely Virtues\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 6. Leo Sullivan of The Washington Post praised it as \\"an engrossing film with lots of heart and even a soul,\\" adding, \\"Playing with splendid conviction, Stewart forgoes his usual tricks to gain sympathy for this widower who has raised six sons and an equally sturdy daughter. His performance is a thoughtful study in one man's attempt at neutrality.\\"Sullivan, Leo (July 29, 1965). \\"'Shenandoah' Abets a Welcome Trend\\". The Washington Post. B6. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"Basically sentimental, the film even includes a scene where the longstanding but still sorrowing widower philosophizes about life over his wife's grave, but the treatment often has a freshness and humour which show that McLaglen has learned from his admiration for John Ford ... James Stewart, whose laconic drawl makes the dialogue sound funnier than it really is, gives one of the best performances of his career.\\" The film was particularly successful at the box office within the state of Virginia, the movie's locale. Awards In 1966, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound (Waldon O. Watson). For her part in Shenandoah, Rosemary Forsyth was nominated for a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer - Female. Adaptations The film was adapted as a hit Broadway musical in 1975, which won John Cullum his first Tony Award for Best Actor.

It approved and monitored higher education institutions in England through 'access agreements'. All English universities and colleges that wanted to charge higher fees must have had 'access agreements' approved by the Director of Fair Access to Higher Education. The first Director, appointed in 2004, was Sir Martin Harris. He was followed by Les Ebdon, whose appointment was confirmed in February 2012. As a consequence of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017, OFFA and the Higher Education Funding Council for England were replaced by the new Office for Students. OFFA's responsibilities officially ceased on the 31 March 2018. Background The Higher Education Act 2004 introduced the concept of variable tuition fees for the first time. Whilst some parts of the United Kingdom, most notably Scotland, did not implement top-up fees, most universities and higher education institutions (HEIs) in the United Kingdom in England and sought to implement the new funding regime. That regime allowed HEIs to charge tuition fees of any amount from £0 to £3,000. (These caps were raised in 2010.) At the time this policy was being debated there was considerable concern that the amount of debt new graduates would be faced with could dissuade some potential students from entering higher education altogether. Thus, as part of the debate, the government decided to institute a regulator to ensure that HEIs took steps to ensure that such dissuasion did not occur. The Act established the post of Director of Fair Access to Higher Education and the supporting body OFFA, and gave the Director the power to prevent a HEI charging fees above £1,200 if it could not satisfy the regulator that it would make adequate provision for widening access and encouraging participation. For the academic year starting September 2012, the amount that institutions could charge increased to £9,000, subject to approval by the Director of Fair Access to Higher Education. Structure It was headquartered in Stoke Gifford in South Gloucestershire in the offices of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). Aims OFFA stated that it had two core aims: # To increase the proportion of learners from under-represented and disadvantaged groups who enter, succeed in and are well prepared to progress from higher education to employment or postgraduate study. # To make faster progress in improving access to the most selective higher education institutions by students from under-represented and disadvantaged groups. These aims were primarily delivered through implementation of approved access agreements, and OFFA's work in monitoring access agreements and disseminating their view of good practice. Access agreements An access agreement was a document setting out how a university or college charging higher fees intends to safeguard and promote fair access to higher education through its outreach work, financial support etc. It also includes targets and milestones, set by the university/college itself. Many access agreements remained in force following OFFA's closure and continued to be regulated by the Office for Students. Bursaries OFFA defined a bursary as a cash award where the student's eligibility is either wholly or partially dependent on their assessed household income. This is separate from a scholarship which it defined as an award where eligibility is not dependent on the recipient's assessed household income. For example, some universities and colleges offer scholarships based on academic criteria or whether the student lives in the local area. Criticism Charges often made against OFFA were that it levelled down standards rather than raising themMedia criticism: 'Mediocrity'Media criticism: 'Social engineering' and that it replaced one form of unfairness with another as reforms were being achieved by \\"disadvantaging\\" the brightest children.Media criticism: 'Disadvantaging the brightest' At the time of its foundation, one member of the then shadow cabinet called OFFA “an interfering, manipulative, corrosive emblem of political correctness. At the time of its closure, the outgoing director rebuked this criticism and noted that for the period of OFFA's existence, there had been an 82% increase in the higher education participation of disadvantaged areas.

It was released in West Germany (RCA PL 28429) in August 1980 and France (Barclay Records BA 253 200149) in 1980. Background After Donovan failed to chart in both the UK and US, Donovan once again left his long-time producer Mickie Most. He travelled throughout mainland Europe, bringing attention to world hunger and protesting against nuclear proliferation and weapons development. RCA signed him for a European record distribution deal, beginning with Neutronica, released in 1980. The album did not receive distribution in the US or UK. Many of the songs Donovan wrote for Neutronica are directly related to his political views. At the time, he was campaigning against what he viewed as disproportionate military spending while famine existed across much of the world. Donovan also recorded \\"Mee Mee I Love You\\", a song co-written by his daughter Astrella Leitch, and two war-themed songs, the traditional Crimean War tune \\"Heights of Alma\\" and Eric Bogle's World War I ballad \\"No Man's Land\\". The arrangements on Neutronica range from synthesizer-based rock songs to acoustic folk songs. Donovan's vocals similarly range from the harder singing style prevalent on Donovan on the rockers, and softer singing on the acoustic numbers. Reissues *On 28 August 2001, Pilot Records released Neutronica (Pilot 89) in the UK for the first time on CD with seven bonus tracks. The first two bonus cuts are concert recordings of \\"The Heights of Alma\\" and Buffy Sainte-Marie's \\"Universal Soldier\\". The next two bonus tracks, \\"Only to Be Expected\\" and \\"Split Wood Not Atoms\\", were acoustic demo recordings for Neutronica. The fifth and sixth bonus tracks are alternate versions of \\"Shipwreck\\" and \\"Madrigalinda\\" respectively. The last bonus track, \\"Fair Ye Well\\", is an a cappella song.

Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., 545 U.S. 119 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court decision that determined (in a 6-3 decision) that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to foreign cruise ships in American waters. Background Douglas Spector and the four other disabled plaintiffs use mobility scooters and wheelchairs. They sued Norwegian Cruise Line under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act after traveling aboard cruise ships (the Norwegian Sea and the Norwegian Star) registered in the Bahamas. Spector had purchased premium tickets, which were marketed as more handicap friendly. However, the ship was not easily accessible. He had limited or no access to swimming pools, restaurants, elevators, and public restrooms because of physical barriers. The premium room was of lower quality than less expensive non-wheelchair friendly rooms. He was not allowed to participate in emergency drills and no emergency exit plan was laid out for disabled persons. Norwegian Cruise Line argued that American laws did not apply to the cruise line because it was registered in the Bahamas. The cruise line's ships, however, were based out of Miami ports. Spector first sued the cruise line in federal district court in Houston, Texas (Spector's home town). The court ruled against Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd. saying that despite their foreign flag they must abide by American laws when in American waters. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit overturned the lower court and moved for the case to be dismissed. Spector appealed the case to the Supreme Court. Decision The judgment of the Fifth Circuit was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.

The borough is centered on Constitución Station and the square of the same name and can be reached by subway, by bus (notably Colectivo 60) and enjoys easy access by car via 9 de Julio, San Juan and Caseros Avenues, as well as the 25 de Mayo toll road. Ceiling in Constitución station The area, on the outskirts of Buenos Aires in colonial times, was granted a parish in 1769 and incorporated into the city in 1777. Home to an important mission of Bethlehemites, they maintained a convalescent clinic there until their papal suppression in 1821. The area then became home to a large farmer's market and its relative elevation began attracting development. The market was renamed in honor of the recently promulgated Argentine Constitution in 1856 and the neighborhood, long centered on the market, soon acquired the name. Work began in 1864 on the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway led the opening of a station at the market and with it, the rapid growth of the area as an immigrants' quarter. Groundbreaking for a new railway terminal in 1885 was accompanied by the razing of the market in favor of Constitución Plaza. A non-profit clinic opened by the Anglican Reverend Barton Lodge in 1844 became the British Hospital in 1887 (still the borough's largest). The neighborhood was subsequently home to Hipólito Yrigoyen, a co-founder of the centrist Radical Civic Union in 1891 who tirelessly campaigned for and, in 1912, won the right to universal (male) suffrage in Argentina and the secret ballot. Elected president in 1916, his Constitución home was ransacked during a coup against him in 1930. The mayor appointed in 1976 by Argentina's last dictatorship, Osvaldo Cacciatore, had plans drawn up for eight freeways within the city proper, three of which were finished. The two busiest, the 25 de Mayo and 9 de Julio Freeways, meet at a junction north of Constitución station. The structures, though a great benefit to commuters, led to the exodus of much of the neighborhood's middle class.

It is located approximately northeast of Calgary at the junction of Highway 27 and Highway 805. The hamlet is located in census division No. 5 and in the federal riding of Crowfoot. The main industry is agriculture. The community is home to the Gopher Hole Museum, dedicated to stuffed Richardson's ground squirrels (technically not gophers) in anthropomorphic taxidermy settings.

Location Laurel Canyon is focused on its central thoroughfare, Laurel Canyon Boulevard. However, unlike other nearby canyon neighborhoods, Laurel Canyon has houses lining one side of the main street most of the way up to Mulholland Drive. There are many side roads that branch off the main canyon, but most are not through streets, reinforcing the self-contained nature of the neighborhood. Some of the main side streets are Mount Olympus, Kirkwood, Wonderland Avenue, Willow Glen, and Lookout Mountain Avenue. The zip code for a portion of the neighborhood is 90046. Laurel Canyon Boulevard is an important North-South route between: West Hollywood, Hollywood, and Central Los Angeles; and Studio City and the eastern San Fernando Valley. The canyon's division between the two regions is defined by Mulholland Drive. The Laurel Canyon neighborhood is generally bounded by West Hollywood to the west and south, Hollywood to the east, and Studio City to the north. HistoryTongva Indigenous Peoples= The Laurel Canyon area was inhabited by the Tongva people, a regional tribe of the indigenous peoples of California, for thousands of years. A spring-fed stream flowed year-round providing water. The reliable water supply attracted colonial Spanish ranchers who started grazing sheep on the hillsides in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. After the Mexican–American War and the advent of U.S. statehood for California in 1850, the area was settled by Americans interested in water rights. =Lookout Mountain= Until the twentieth century, passage up the canyon was made on foot or by mule. In 1907, an 82-mile dirt road, later named Laurel Canyon Boulevard, was built. It ran up the canyon, dividing at what is now Lookout Mountain Road; the left road went up to the summit of Lookout Mountain, and the right branch of the road went to the top of the Santa Monica Mountains and then down to the San Fernando Valley. In 1908, the Lookout Mountain Park and Water Co. was formed to purchase 280 acres on Lookout Mountain, just west of Laurel Canyon, subdivided and marketed as mountain vacation properties. On Aug. 14, 1908, the Los Angeles Times announced that the company would build Lookout Mountain Inn at the summit of Lookout Mountain and Sunset Plaza roads, and Lookout Mountain Park, Bungalow Land at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Lookout Mountain Avenue and Wonderland Park. Two years later, the company widened the winding dirt road to the top of Lookout Mountain where they built the Lookout Mountain Inn.https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d;=LAH19100306.2.133.57 Los Angeles Herald, Volume 37, Number 156, 6 March 1910 \\"Mrs. F. J. Talamantes, accompanied by her daughters, Mrs. M. D. O'Farrell and Miss Fay Talamantes, left yesterday for a two weeks' stay at Bungalow Inn, in Laurel canyon\\" In 1912, Charles Mann, a real estate developer and Richard Shoemaker, an engineer, built a trackless electric trolley bus line which ran between the Laurel Canyon Pacific Electric Shuttle stop at the foot of Laurel Canyon at Sunset Boulevard, The Laurel Canyon Pacific Electric Shuttle ran from the foot of Laurel Canyon at Sunset Boulevard to Gardner Junction at Gardner Street and Sunset Boulevard, Beverly Hills line of the Pacific Electric Railway station.

Trolley buses passing each other on Laurel Canyon Drive. The bus on the right is coasting downhill with its trolley poles down.:de:Datei:Trackless Trolley 00018878.jpg The car had two trolley poles, one to a positive overhead wire and one to a ground overhead wire, and was able to sway to either side of the street, only using power uphill. The trolley was actually a 1912 Oldsmobile with an electric motor and 10-passenger capacity. The overhead wires came down and the service was replaced by Stanley Steamers about 1915. Until 1918, the trackless trolley traveled up and down Laurel Canyon to meet the half hour schedule to Los Angeles. It was insufficiently patronized and discontinued when Pacific Electric stopped running streetcars between Gardner Junction and Laurel Canyon Boulevard, and demand failed to support it. On October 26, 1918, a fire, fanned by strong Santa Ana winds, burned about 200 acres and totally destroyed Lookout Mountain Inn at the summit of Lookout Mountain Avenue and Sunset Plaza Drive. Another major fire occurred in July 1959, destroying some 38 homes. As the roads were improved, access was possible by automobile. Now a vacant lot, the corner of Lookout Mountain Avenue and Laurel Canyon Blvd (2401 Laurel Canyon Blvd) is where the Tavern, a famous 1915 \\"Log Cabin\\" mansion stood, with its 80-foot living room, floor to ceiling fireplace, bowling alley and indoor sunken swimming pool. It was once occupied by silent film star Tom Mix but spent years on the rental market. In 1968 it was rented by Frank Zappa who turned it into a recording studio and celebrity hangout. Interview with Pauline Butcher, Zappa's live-in secretary. However, Zappa moved out after six months. The house burned to the ground on Halloween 1981. Directly across the street, at 2400 Laurel Canyon Blvd., is site of the home, long-gone, that magician Harry Houdini may have rented around 1919. It was originally the Walker estate. =Counterculture of the 1960s & 70s= Laurel Canyon became a nexus of counterculture activity and attitudes in the mid-late 1960s and early 1970s, becoming famous as home to many of L.A.'s rock musicians, such as Joni Mitchell; Frank Zappa; Jim Morrison of The Doors; Carole King; The Byrds; Buffalo Springfield; Canned Heat; John Mayall; members of the band The Eagles; the band Love; Neil Young; Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys as well as James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Harry Nilsson; and Micky Dolenz & Peter Tork of The Monkees. Tork's home was considered one of Laurel Canyon's biggest party houses with all-night, drug-fueled sleepovers, well attended by the hippest musicians and movie stars of the era. John Phillips of the Mamas & the Papas took inspiration from their home in Laurel Canyon for the song \\"Twelve Thirty (Young Girls Are Coming to the Canyon)”, released in 1967. The following year, blues artist John Mayall recorded and released the album Blues from Laurel Canyon based on his experiences during a vacation that he spent in the Canyon. Perhaps most famously, the area and its denizens served as inspiration for Joni Mitchell's third album, Ladies of the Canyon, released in 1970. The house she lived in was immortalized in the Crosby, Stills, and Nash song, \\"Our House\\" (1970), written by her then-lover Graham Nash. The group is reputed to have first sung together in Mitchell's living room.Sheila Weller, Girls Like Us: Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon--And the Journey of a Generation, Atria Books, 2008, . Legendary rock photographer Henry Diltz was also a resident and used the scenic Canyon backdrop for many of his historic photos of rock musicians casually socializing. Several of his photos became iconic representations of the 1960s and 1970s' West Coast music scene; others became famous album sleeve covers, such as CSN's debut album, Crosby, Stills & Nash (photographed in nearby West Hollywood). Later years Musician Josh Tillman has said that his output under the moniker Father John Misty was partly inspired by a relocation to and personal reinvention in Laurel Canyon. The song \\"I Went to the Store One Day,\\" from his 2015 album I Love You, Honeybear, recounts the story of how Tillman met his wife, Emma, in the parking lot of the Laurel Canyon Country Store. =Wonderland murders= On July 1, 1981, three members and one associate of the Wonderland Gang, so- called because they were based at 8763 Wonderland Avenue, died in the Wonderland murders (also known as the \\"Four on the Floor murders\\" or the \\"Laurel Canyon murders\\"). Salon reports: \\"The massacre took place just down the street from what was then the home of Jerry Brown, who was California’s governor at the time. And 8763 Wonderland Ave. itself is said to have been inhabited at one time by Paul Revere and the Raiders.\\" See also * Counterculture of the 1960s *Echo in the Canyon * Laurel Canyon (film) * Lookout Mountain Air Force Station * The Mansion (recording studio) *Laurel Canyon (documentary) ReferencesFurther reading * Michael Walker, Laurel Canyon: The Inside Story of Rock ’n’ Roll’s Legendary Neighborhood, Farrar Straus and Giroux (16 May 2006), hardcover, 277 pages, trade paperback (May 1, 2007); . * Barney Hoskyns, Hotel California: Singer-Songwriters and Cocaine Cowboys in the LA Canyons, 1967–1976, Harper Perennial (2006), Paperback, 316 pages, * Harvey Kubernik, Scott Calamar, Diltz, Henry, Lou Adler, Canyon of Dreams: The Magic and the Music of Laurel Canyon (Sterling Publishing, 2009), 384 pages, .

Empress Sunjeong (Hangul: 순정효황후, Hanja: 純貞孝皇后) (19 September 1894 - 3 February 1966) was the consort of Emperor Yunghui, the last emperor of the Joseon Dynasty and Korea. BiographyEarly life= Empress Sunjeong was born Lady Yun, or Yun Jeong-sun (Hangul: 윤증순, Hangja: 尹貞淳), in Seoul to Lady Yu of the Gigye Yu clan and Marquis Yun Taek-yeong, the Lord of the Haepyeong Yun clan. Yun Bo-seon, 2nd president of the Republic of Korea, was her ninth cousin three times removed. Her mother was given the royal title of \\"Lady Keung-heung of the Gigye Yun clan, Princess Consort to the Internal Prince\\" (Hangul: 경흥부부인 기계 유씨, Hanja: 慶興府夫人 杞溪 兪氏) and her father was given the royal title of \\"Internal Prince Haepeong, Yun Taek-yeong\\" (Hangul: 해풍부원군, 윤택영, Hanja: 海豊府院君 尹澤榮) when she became Crown Princess Consort. Jeong-sun married Crown Prince Cheok, who is 20 years her senior, on 24 January 1907 at the age of 13 after his first wife, Crown Princess Consort Min (Empress Sunmyeong) died on 5 November 1904. On 20 July 1907, she became Empress Consort of Korea when her husband ascended the throne after the forced abdication of his father, Emperor Gwangmu. The Empress was demoted by the Japanese government by the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty of 1910 and thereafter officially known as Her Majesty, Queen Yi of Korea (this title, however, was ignored in Korea). Empress Sunjeong became a widow 24 April 1926, when Emperor Yunghui died without issue at the Changdeok Palace in Seoul. Emperor Yunghui had been rendered infertile (and was also said to be mentally disabled) by poisoning in the Coffee Poisoning Plot =Korean War= During the Korean War, Empress Sunjeong stayed in Changdeok Palace as long as she could in the face of advancing forces from North Korea. During the war, the soldiers of North Korea invaded the palace but she reproved them and drove them all out. She then escaped secretly to the Unhyeon Palace when the war situation became too serious. As the war progressed, she moved to Busan with other Imperial family members, including Princess Hui (wife of Prince Wanheung). According to The World is One, Princess Yi Bangja's autobiography, Empress Sunjeong went to Busan on foot. =After the Korean War= Queen Yun Returning to the Palace. After the war, the new government of President Rhee Syng-man, jealous of the popularity of the Imperial House, prevented Empress Sunjeong from entering the Changdeok Palace. She was kept imprisoned in Suin Hall, a narrow and unsuitable cottage in Jeongneung, Seoul. After a change in government in 1961 she returned to Nakseon Hall, Changdeok Palace with her dutiful ladies-in-waiting Park Chang-bok (d.1981), Kim Myung-gil (d.1983) and Sung Ok-yeom (d.2001), and five other staff. Empress Sunjeong became a Buddhist in her later years. She died childless on 3 February 1966, aged 72, at Nakseon Hall, Changdeok Palace, Seoul from a heart attack. She was given a state funeral and a private Buddhist funeral. She is buried beside her husband, Emperor Yunghui at the Yureung. She is known posthumously as Empress Sunjeong of Korea (officially, 純貞孝皇后, 순정효황후; Sunjeonghyo Hwanghu; Empress Sunjeong-hyo).  Titles  * 19 September 1894 - 24 January 1907: 1\\\\.

The nephew of Halifax businessman Alexander Keith he worked for a time as a clerk in his uncle's brewery. During the American Civil War Keith acted mostly as a blockade runner and courier.

Aftermath of the Mosel bombing.Hunted down by one of his victims, Keith fled again with Cecelia to Germany, hobnobbing with wealthy socialites and Saxon generals under the assumed name of \\"William King Thomas\\". When the couple began to run out of money, Keith concocted a plot to blow up passenger ships and collect the insurance money.

Early life  Keyser was born in Baltimore, Maryland on November 23, 1835, the son of Samuel Stouffer Keyser and Elizabeth (née Wyman) Keyser. He was educated at various private schools in Baltimore, and entered St. Timothy's Academy in Catonsville, Maryland in 1846. He and his twin brother, Samuel, remained there until 1850, when their father's declining health and weakening financial situation made it necessary for the boys to leave school. Samuel eventually moved to New York City to make his way in business there, while William stayed in Baltimore to manage his father's warehouses. Career In 1857, William formed a partnership with his other brother, Irvine Keyser under the name \\"Keyser Brothers\\". He was active in the firm, as well as the Abbott Iron Co. and the Baltimore Copper Company, throughout the 1860s. = Baltimore and Ohio Railroad = In 1870, William Keyser became involved with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, taking a position as second vice-president during the term of its president, John Work Garrett. The town of Keyser, West Virginia was named for him. While at the B&O;, he was instrumental in labor negotiations during the 1871 and 1877 railroad workers strikes. In 1881, Keyser left the B&O.; His action was precipitated by Garrett's decision to promote his son, Robert Garrett, over Keyser. = Baltimore Copper Company = Keyser next ventured into copper manufacturing. In 1882, the court appointed him to oversee the financial affairs of Pope and Cole, a local copper processor. The company had declared bankruptcy, and Keyser, as one of their largest creditors, had a vested interest in seeing them regain solvency. His association with Pope and Cole piqued his interest in the copper industry. He eventually reestablished Pope & Cole as the Baltimore Copper Company and purchased the Baltimore Smelting and Rolling Company. His entry into copper production allowed him to amass a fortune larger than if he had stayed with the railroad. = Philanthropy = Keyser put his money to many philanthropic uses. He donated funds for a hall at Hannah More Academy in Reisterstown, and was instrumental in the founding of Johns Hopkins University's Homewood campus. In November 1894, Daniel Coit Gilman, the university's first president, asked Keyser for his help in securing another site for the school, which was outgrowing its location in downtown Baltimore. In early 1901, Keyser and his brother Samuel offered 179 acres to the university with the condition that \\"at least 30 acres of the property be given to the city for use as a public park\\", which then became Wyman Park. Material in the Keyser-Wyman Papers recounts his association with his cousin, William Wyman, who donated a large portion on the land, and their efforts on behalf of the University. Before his death in June, 1904, Keyser was appointed a member of the Citizens' Emergency Committee which was charged with developing a plan for rebuilding the downtown after the calamitous Baltimore fire of February 1904. The Committee prepared street and dock improvement plans, which were adopted. Personal life On November 11, 1858, he married Mary Hoke \\"Mollie\\" Brent (1838–1911), daughter of the well-known Baltimore lawyer, Robert Brent. In Baltimore, they lived in a home designed by prominent architect T. Henry Randall, and were the parents of three children who lived to adulthood: * Robert Brent Keyser (1859–1927), who married Ellen Cary McHenry, a daughter of James Howard McHenry (a grandson of Secretary of War James McHenry). He served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Johns Hopkins University from 1903 until shortly before his death in 1927. * Mathilde Lawrence Keyser (1870–1929), who married William Maurice Manly, the widow of Frances Howell Hughes Kennedy (eldest granddaughter of U.S. Senator Anthony Kennedy) in 1902. * William Keyser Jr. (1871–1936), who married Jean Hancy, a daughter of Edward Johnson Hancy. Keyser died suddenly as a brain aneurysm burst at his summer home, Brentwood, in Reistertown on June 3, 1904. Within days of his death, his twin brother Samuel was \\"lying ill at his residence\\" in New York and his nephew, Henry R. Keyser (son of his brother H.

The chemical makeup of painite contains calcium, zirconium, boron, aluminium and oxygen (CaZrAl9O15(BO3)).

It was situated on the south coast of the island, at the foot of Mount Oche. It is mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad, as controlled by the Abantes. The name also appears in the Linear B tablets as \\"ka-ru-to\\" (identified as Carystus). Thucydides writes that the town was founded by Dryopes.Scymn. 576. Its name was derived from Carystus, the son of Cheiron.Eustath. ad Hom. 2.539  Persian War  Silver stater of Karystos, 313-265 BCE. Obverse: Cow and calf. Reverse: rooster, ΚΑΡΥΣΤΙΩΝ. A Persian force landed at Carystus in 490 BCE and quickly subdued its inhabitants. Soon after the Battle of Salamis the Athenian fleet led by Themistocles extorted money from the city. Soon afterward Carystus refused to join the Delian League. The Athenians wanted Carystus to join the Delian League, but seeming as though it had been under Persian control, they refused. Athens would not accept a refusal, so they attacked and plundered Carystus. This forced Carystus to side with the Delian league. Athens employed this tactic frequently, as it was said to be better for the league. This way, a Greek city-state could not side with Persia and offer their city as a base, and also could not get the advantages of a Persian-free Greece without paying their share. The creation of the Delian league leads to the imperial nature of Athens that fueled the Peloponnesian War. Imperial nature tends to take on a modern association, however with the creation of the league essentially people of uneducated agricultural background were given the right to vote in the assembly. This version of Athenian democracy took on a role that allowed for a tyrannical nature of a seemingly egalitarian ideal. The league demanded submission to create a unified Greece, the only problem is that instead of creating a standing army or improved military strength to prevent further invasion, the Athenians under the direction of Pericles started the Periclean building projects that squandered funds and glorified Athens and Greece in their defeat of Persia. This misapplication of tribute from Attican city- states created the rejection of this idea by Sparta, and subsequently the Peloponnesian War, not securing Greece from an outside Persian attack, but opening it for an internal rejection of the league.  Further history  The Carystians fought on the side of the Athenians in the Lamian War. They espoused the side of the Romans in the war against Philip V of Macedon. Carystus was chiefly celebrated for its marble, which was in much request at Rome. Strabo places the quarries at Marmarium, a place upon the coast near Carystus, opposite Halae Araphenides in Attica; but the marks of the quarries have been found upon Mt. Oche, where seven entire columns, apparently on the spot where they had been quarried were observed, and at the distance of three miles from the sea. This marble is the Cipollino marble of the Romans - a green marble, with white zones. At Carystus the mineral asbestos was also obtained, which was hence called the Carystian stone.λίθος Καρύστιος, Plutarch de Def. Orac. p. 707; Apoll. Dysc. Hist. Mirab. 36.  Christian bishopric  As an episcopal see, Carystus was initially a suffragan of Corinth, but in the 9th century it came to be associated with Athens and appears as such in the Notitia Episcopatuum composed under Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise (886-912). A bishop of the see called Cyriacus was one of the signatories of the letter of the episcopate of the Corinthian province to Emperor Leo I the Thracian in 458.

As the bawdy character Mo McCackie, Rene was one of the most well-known and successful Australian comedians of the 20th century. A 1927 recording of Rene and Nat Phillips performing as Stiffy and Mo, called The Sailors, was added to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia's Sounds of Australia registry in 2011.National Film and Sound Archive: 'The Sailors' on the Sounds of Australia registry Biography Born in Adelaide, South Australia, Rene was the fourth of seven children of a Dutch and English Jewish parents. Named Henry van de Sluice (later spelt variously \\"van der Sluys\\"), aged 10 \\"Harry\\" won a singing competition at an Adelaide market and in 1905 appeared professionally in the pantomime, Sinbad the Sailor, at the Theatre Royal and later at the Tivoli, in a black face, singing and dancing act. About 1905 the Sluice family moved to Melbourne, Harry (as he was called) was briefly an apprentice jockey and thereafter maintained a keen interest in racing. Despite his father's opposition, in July 1908 he secured an engagement with James Brennan's vaudeville at the Gaiety Theatre. Of medium height with a distinctly Jewish profile, with dark hair, a pale smooth complexion and large soulful brown eyes, 'Boy Roy' (his stage name) had an appealing pathos. Most of his spare time was spent studying the famous English music-hall comedians at Harry Rickards' Opera House. Unsuccessful in Melbourne, he appeared at Brennan's National Amphitheatre, Sydney in 1910 and had adopted the new stage name Roy Rene (Rene after a famous French clown). Later he joined J. C. Bain's suburban vaudeville in Sydney and toured New South Wales with bush companies. =Enter 'Mo'= While playing at Bain's Princess Theatre, Railway Square, Sydney, in 1914 Rene was noticed by producer Ben Fuller, who engaged him to tour New Zealand. He developed his unique style and perfected the black and white make-up which became his trademark. Returning to Sydney in November 1915, he joined Albert Bletsoe's revue company at the Fullers' National Theatre in Sydney. In July 1916 Rene ('Mo') teamed up with comedian Nat Phillips ('Stiffy'), and the duo became the famous Stiffy and Mo, renowned for their larrikin comedy. They opened at the Sydney Princess, were an instant success, and in December moved to the Grand Opera House, playing in the spectacular pantomime The Bunyip, followed by a season in Melbourne. On 29 March 1917 at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Sydney, Henry van der Sluice married an actress Dorothy Davis; childless, they were divorced in May 1929. 'Stiffy and Mo' played on the Fullers' circuit with enormous success until 1925 when, after a confrontation in Adelaide, they split up. Rene continued his tour at the Luxor, Perth, with a member of his company, Mike Connors, as his straight man. In 1925–26 Rene appeared with outstanding success in a straight play, Give and Take, starring American comedian Harry Green, in Melbourne and Sydney. Back on the Tivoli circuit in May 1926, he was partnered by Fred Bluett in an act entitled 'The Admiral and the Sailor'. Fuller persuaded him to rejoin Phillips in 1927; once again 'Stiffy and Mo' broke box-office records, but the partnership finally broke up in New Zealand in 1928. Rene returned to Fuller's Theatre in Sydney with his own company, Mo and his Merrymakers. In Sydney on 3 July 1929 Rene married again, this time to Sadie Gale (1902–1997), a member of his company. Six months later he collapsed with peritonitis while appearing in Frank Neil's revue Clowns in Clover, in Melbourne and nearly died. He returned to the theatre in mid-1930 for H. D. McIntosh in a revue, Pot Luck, at the Tivoli, Melbourne, but business was bad because of the Great Depression. Rene and Sadie resorted to a tour of Hoyts' suburban theatres in Sydney, followed by a brief vaudeville season in New Zealand, but the Fullers were disbanding their revue companies. In April 1931 Rene joined Connors and his wife Queenie Paul, who had successfully opened low-priced, weekly-change variety at the New Haymarket Theatre, Sydney. By 1932 the Connors had taken over the Melbourne Tivoli and converted the old Sydney Opera House to the new Tivoli, where Rene and Jim Gerald continued to appear after the Connors sold out in mid-1933. In 1934 he made his only film, Strike Me Lucky, for Ken G. Hall at Cinesound; however film was not his medium, as rapport with a live audience was essential to his comedy. Early next year Rene played in Ernest C. Rolls's lavish revue, Rhapsodies of 1935, at the Apollo Theatre, Melbourne. In 1935–36, in partnership with Connors and Paul, he appeared in variety in Sydney and Melbourne, then returned to the Tivoli at the instigation of English producer Wallace Parnell. By early 1939 Rene was in conflict with Frank Neil, general manager of the Tivoli, who terminated his contract: on Neil's death in January 1941 Parnell immediately reinstated him. Throughout World War II Rene played to packed houses, but his contract was not renewed in 1945. =Radio days= Turning to radio in 1946, Rene signed a contract with Colgate-Palmolive Pty Ltd to appear in Calling the Stars with a live audience at the 2GB theatrette in Sydney; his much-acclaimed \\"McCackie Mansion\\" segment was a highlight. Living at 13 Coffin Street, 'Mo' was the suburban householder whose life was made miserable by relatives, neighbours and friends. He later appeared in Cavalcade with Jack Davey, and as Professor McCackie in It Pays to be Ignorant. Rene briefly returned to the stage in 1949 in the revue, McCackie Moments, at the Kings in Melbourne. By the time his radio contract expired in 1950 he was plagued by ill health; he appeared once in McCackie Manor for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1951 and in 1952 starred in The New Atlantic Show, again capturing a nationwide audience. Survived by his wife, son and daughter, Rene died of atherosclerotic heart disease at his home at Kensington, New South Wales, on 22 November 1954 and was buried in the Jewish section of Rookwood Cemetery. Although widely unknown overseas, 'Mo' was hailed by visiting celebrities such as Dame Sybil Thorndike and Jack Benny as a comic genius in the company of Charlie Chaplin. Lecherous, leering and ribald, he epitomized the Australian 'lair',Strine and Australian Slang – Lair to Loo always trying to 'make a quid' or to 'knock off a Sheila'; yet some of his funniest moments were when he was being 'posh', as in his outrageous parody of Noël Coward's Private Lives with Sadie. He was a Freemason.What is Freemasonry? Legacy and influence The memory of Rene lives on in the Mo Awards, presented annually for excellence in live performance. The statuette presented to the recipients is in the form of Rene in his Mo McCackie persona. Garry McDonald played Roy Rene/Mo in the 1977 theatre production Young Mo, written by Steve J.

Their records were released on the Chicago record label, Victory Records. During the course of the band's initial run of fourteen years, they released six studio albums before disbanding in 2005. BackgroundFormation= The band was originally conceived in 1989 in a basement in West Seneca, New York, and was named Solid State. In 1989, the lineup was guitarist Scott Dressler, then 15 years of age, 17-year-old drummer Mike Kimaid, Daryl Taberski, age 18 on bass, and Tiger Balduf, the eldest at 19 on vocals. Prior to recording their first demo as Solid State on January 30, 1990, Quest for Reality, Tiger Balduf left the band to get married, and Mike Kimaid left to join the Lockport, NY based band The Watchmen. Drafted to take their places were Chris Galas on vocals and Peter Dawidzik on drums. Soon after recording, Peter Dawidzik left the band to go to school. On May 22, 1990, Solid State recorded their second demo, Accept Your Fate, with their friend Mike Lampe, who had assisted with the previous demo, as well. At the time of recording, the band was composed of Chris Galas on vocals, Scott Dressler playing guitar, Jason Kourkounis on drums, and Daryl Taberski on bass. During the spring of 1991, Solid State went through a big lineup shift; Kourkounis left the band to pursue other musical interests, and Kimaid rejoined the band along with The Watchmen guitarist Joe Smith, making the band a five-piece. After these changes to their lineup, the band decided to change their name to Snapcase. Between the years of 1991 and 1992, Snapcase recorded two demos with Dennis Fura, Break The Silence and King of the Mountain. In 1992 the band was signed to Chicago hardcore label Victory Records and recorded their first 7 inch, Comatose, with Mike Sac and Robby Takac that year. There was a line-up change following the release date of the single; Taberski moved over to vocals, replacing Chris Galas, Bob Whiteside from Buffalo, NY band Support took over on bass, and Jon Salemi, who played drums in Support, joined to replace Joe Smith, who left for school. In 1993, Kimaid left the band after partially recording the band's first album and was replaced by former Buffalo, NY based Slugfest drummer, Timothy Redmond, who performed on the rest of the tracks. Snapcase's first full-length recording, Lookinglasself, was released in 1993 and was recorded with Don Fury and Fred Betschen. In early 1995, the band released the Steps EP, which they recorded with Fred Betschen. This was the last recording to feature Scott Dressler, who left the band in the fall of 1995 to go to graduate school. He was replaced by Frank Vicario of Buffalo, NY band Fadeaway. In the summer of 1996, The California Takeover was released which featured live recordings from Snapcase, Earth Crisis, and Strife. =Progression Through Unlearning and Designs for Automotion= Progression Through Unlearning was recorded and mixed in a period of two weeks with producer Steve Evetts at Trax East in New Jersey. Guitarist Jon Salemi recorded the album with \\"full-blown chicken pox\\" and noted that the album's recording was \\"very, very quick.\\" The album was released in April 1997. The album is considered to be revolutionary by many fans of hardcore. The band set out on a summer tour, and featured performances on the Vans Warped Tour. One of the album's tracks, \\"Breaking and Reaching\\", was used by Cartoon Network's Toonami for promos of Mobile Fighter G Gundam in 2002. In the fall of 1997, the band took some time off so that members could pursue education. In 1998, the band resumed touring, and was the opening band on the fall tour of the Deftones and Quicksand. They also went into the studio with Brian McTernan in the fall of 1998 to record a cover of the Bad Brains \\"I\\", released on Century Media's Never Give In tribute record, and a split EP with Boysetsfire that was released in the summer of 1999. These were the last recordings with bassist Bob Whiteside. He was replaced by Dustin Perry, formerly of the Minneapolis, MN band Threadbare. They headlined Hellfest that summer in Syracuse, NY. Designs for Automotion, the band's third full-length album, was recorded in the summer of 1999 with Steve Evetts was released in January 2000. They spent most of 2000 on tour, performing on the Deconstruction tour in Europe with NOFX and playing the main stage of the Vans Warped Tour in the summer. Ben Lythberg began playing drums for the band during the fall, winter and spring while Redmond finished his master's degree. =End Transmission and Bright Flashes= In 2002, the band focused their creative energy on crafting their new album, End Transmission, with Brian McTernan at Salad Days Studios. The result became their fourth full-length album, which was released in September 2002. Redmond officially left the band soon after the release of the album and was permanently replaced by Lythberg. Snapcase toured that fall with Boysetsfire and Atreyu. Their final international tour was in early 2003. They opened for Bad Religion and Finch in the spring of 2003. Bright Flashes was released in November 2003. Featuring songs that were recorded for the conceptual End Transmission album, it also included covers of songs by Helmet, Devo, and Jane's Addiction, and 3 remixes of songs from End Transmission. =Final concert and subsequent activities= The band announced in the fall of 2004 that they would be disbanding, and would play their final show in January 2005 in Buffalo, NY. The final show featured appearances by nearly every member who had ever played in the band. Redmond, Dressler, and Whiteside joined Salemi and Taberski for a performance of the song \\"Lookinglasself\\", and original vocalist Chris Galas joined them for the song \\"Comatose\\". Most of the band members of Snapcase found jobs after disbanding. Timothy Redmond taught AP Government, Global History, The Turbulent Sixties, and Human Rights and Genocide at Williamsville East High School and Scott Dressler was an Assistant Professor of Economics at Villanova University. After Snapcase dissolved, Vicario, Perry and Lythberg briefly participated in the band Attractive with Josh English from the band Sixgoingonseven. Vicario was working on new projects, but he primarily focused on his job in the technology industry. =Reunion shows= Snapcase reunited briefly in late 2007 on November 20 at Mohawk Place in their hometown of Buffalo, New York and on November 24 and 25 at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn. The reunion shows were performed for the benefit of Callum Robbins and the release of the Anti-Matter Anthology book release. In early 2010, Snapcase confirmed to play a series of shows in Europe including a performance at the 2010 Groezrock Festival in Belgium and also confirmed a reunion show with Sick of It All in Buffalo, N.Y., for May 8, 2010. Guitarist Frank Vicario later stated that the band had no intention of doing an extended reunion beyond the European and Buffalo, N.Y., shows. Snapcase was later forced to cancel their previously announced European reunion shows due to the eruption of Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull and its resulting ash plume engulfing much of Europe's airspace. The band remarked on their Twitter account that it could be at least three weeks before they'd be able to book different flights. The band still performed in their hometown of Buffalo, NY on May 8. European dates have since been rescheduled for July 2010. Snapcase performed at Fun Fun Fun Fest 2010 in Austin, Texas and played day four of Riot Fest 2010 in Chicago, Illinois at the Congress Theater. Sick of It All announced that Snapcase would be supporting them at their 25th Anniversary show at New York City's Webster Hall on March 26, 2011. On June 12, 2012, Snapcase announced that they have booked a September 14 show at the Outer Harbor in Buffalo, NY with Dropkick Murphys. On July 23, 2015, Snapcase played the tenth annual This Is Hardcore Festival at Union Transfer in Philadelphia. On February 26, 2016, Snapcase played a 25th anniversary show at the Town Ballroom in Buffalo.

The highway passes near the community of Eastlake before turning eastward through forest land. In eastern Manistee County, the roadway crosses the Pine River south of the Tippy Dam Pond in Wellston. M-55 intersects M-37 in western Wexford County southwest of the Caberfae Peaks Ski & Golf Resort. The roadway turns northeasterly along the south shore of Lake Mitchell where it then curves southeasterly to run concurrently along M-115 along the south shore of Lake Cadillac and through the south side of Cadillac. At the interchange with the US 131 freeway, M-55 merges north along the freeway, bypassing downtown Cadillac. On the east side of town, M-55 leaves the freeway and turns east again running through the Pere Marquette State Forest along Watergate Road. When the highway meets M-66, M-55 joins M-66 and runs north through farmland. As the two highways approach Lake City, they run along the shore of Lake Missaukee and through downtown. M-55 turns east again along Houghton Lake Road, separating from M-66 north of the central business district. This section of trunkline passes through mixed farm and wood lands that transitions to mostly forests near Merritt. The road crosses the Muskegon River and follows Lake City Road into the outskirts of Houghton Lake. M-55 passes over the US 127 freeway and enters Houghton Lake Heights. There the highway runs southeasterly along the shores of Houghton Lake into downtown Houghton Lake. M-18 briefly joins M-55 through Prudenville on the east side of the lake, and M-55 follows West Branch Road as it continues east toward Interstate 75 (I-75). Logan Township, Ogemaw County, looking westbound M-55 follows I-75 between exits 227 and 215, a distance of about . This section is the only part of M-55 that has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. From the end of the freeway concurrency, M-55 follows Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) into downtown West Branch. After leaving town, the highway runs through farm lands in rural Ogemaw and Iosco counties. The highway curves southeast into Tawas City. The eastern end of M-55 is at an intersection with US 23 along the shores of the Tawas Bay of Lake Huron. History M-55 passing over US 131 as it joins the Cadillac bypass M-55 had its beginning by July 1, 1919 when it was designated from Cadillac to Merritt. In 1926, M-55 was extended eastward to Houghton Lake over a section of the former M-14 that was not used for the then-new US 27\\\\. At the same time, another segment of the highway was designated between M-76 at West Branch and US 23 at Whittemore. The next year, M-55 was routed along sections of US 27 and M-76 between the two communities. A western extension was added from Cadillac to US 31 near Manistee in 1932 while the eastern end was shifted from Whittemore to Tawas City when US 23 was rerouted through the area. Segments of M-55 have been relocated in the years since the basic routing was completed in the early 1930s. A more direct route from West Branch eastward was created in 1938. Prior to the construction of present-day Hemlock Road through Tawas City, M-55 entered Tawas City via present-day Plank Road, Second Street, Fifth Avenue, and Mathews Street, ending at the present-day intersection of US 23 and Mathews Street. In 1949, US 27 was moved to run to the west of Houghton and Higgins lakes. M-55 was shifted to run concurrently southward along the former M-169 which was replaced by US 27\\\\. At the intersection with the former US 27, M-55 was routed east, and the former route of M-55 was designated as a new M-169. In 1950, this M-169 was redesignated Business M-55 (Bus. M-55). M-55 was rerouted off US 27 when the US 27 freeway was completed in the area. In rerouting M-55, it was shifted back to its former routing through Houghton Lake Heights, replacing Bus. M-55 in late 1961. The last gravel segments were paved in Iosco County between late 1958 and early 1960. Another segment east of Cadillac to M-66 south of Lake City was realigned in 1973. At the same time, M-55 was co- signed with a portion of the newly opened stretch of I-75 between M-157 and West Branch. The last routing change was made in November 2000 when the southern segment of the Cadillac bypass was opened. M-55 was moved out of downtown Cadillac and along the freeway and M-115. US 131 joined M-55 on the bypass the next October when the northern half of the bypass was completed in 2001. Major intersectionsBusiness loop Business M-55 (Bus. M-55) was a business loop designated for just over a decade in Houghton Lake Heights. Bus. M-55 ran for along Houghton Lake Drive between US 27 and Federal Drive next to the Houghton Lake. M-55 was shifted off the road when several highways in the Houghton Lake area were rerouted. US 27 was moved to the west side of the lakes in the area, and M-55 was moved follow US 27, replace the original M-169 in the area and replace a section of the former routing of US 27 in Houghton Lake in 1949. By early 1950, the former route of M-55 through Houghton Lake Heights was designated Bus. M-55. This business loop existed until the US 27 freeway was built in the area in late 1961. At that time, M-55 was moved back to its pre-1949 routing, replacing Bus. M-55.

The US has statutorily codified secondary liability rules for trademarks and patents, but for matters relating to copyright, this has solely been a product of case law developments. In other words, courts, rather than Congress, have been the primary developers of theories and policies concerning secondary liability. Early case law Secondary liability in copyright has come about with case-by-case decisions. In other words, there has not been any real or consolidated theory. Furthermore, patent and copyright cases have tended to cross-cite each other. Examples of this are cases such as Kalem Co. v. Harper BrothersKalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U.S. 55 (1911). (the producer of the movie Ben Hur (1907 film) didn't himself infringe, but was responsible for making and commercially distributing the infringing film), Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co.Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co., 316 F.2d 304 (1963). (a booth in a department store that sold infringing sound recordings and the store was ultimately held liable), and the so-called \\"dance hall\\" cases (the operator of an entertainment establishment was held liable because he had effective control of the premises and obtained a direct financial benefit derived from charging entrance fees to the public).Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein & Co., 36 F. 2d 354 (7th Cir. 1929). The Copyright Act of 1790 did not provide a formal definition of infringement, stating only that “any person or persons who shall print or publish any manuscript, without the consent and approbation of the author or proprietor thereof... shall be liable to suffer and pay to the said author or proprietor all damages occasioned by such injury.” Furthermore, the Copyright Act of 1909 simply provided that any person who “shall infringe the copyright in any work protected under the copyright laws of the United States… shall be liable” for various remedies. Despite the fact that the Copyright Act of 1909 did not explicitly establish liability for acts committed by a party different than the direct infringer, several cases decided under this Act set forth the guidelines under which a party may be deemed secondarily liable. Examples of the gradual recognition by courts of copyright liability extending to those who contribute to or vicariously profit from the infringing acts of others are Fishel v. LueckelFishel v. Lueckel, 53 F. 499 (1892). and Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers.Robert P. Merges, Peter S. Menell, and Mark A. Lemley (2007). Intellectual Property in the New Technological Era, p. 572, Aspen Publishers, New York. Kinds of secondary liability There are generally two kinds of secondary liability developed by courts – vicarious liability and contributory liability. Although the line between these categories of liability is blurry, a precondition for all forms of secondary liability is the underlying act (or acts) of infringement. However, unlike contributory infringement, knowledge is not an element of vicarious liability. 907 F. Supp. 1361, **36, citing 3 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT § 12.04{A}{1}, at 12-70 (1995) Some academics have classified the active inducement adopted in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. as a new type of secondary liability because it is based on express acts of inducement and not on a mere failure to act;Pamela Samuelson,Three Reactions to MGM v. Grokster , 13 Mich. Telecomm. Tech. L. Rev. (2006). furthermore, the specific intent to bring about infringing acts is another important factor in this analysis. =Vicarious liability= One of the theories widely accepted as a basis for liability in copyright infringement cases is vicarious liability.Robert A. Gorman and Jane C. Ginsburg (2009). Copyright Cases and Materials, Foundation Press, New York. The concept of vicarious liability was developed in the Second Circuit as an extension of the common law doctrine of agency – respondeat superior (the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate). Pursuant to this doctrine, courts recognized that employers should be liable for the infringing acts of their employees under traditional master-servant principles. An example of this is M. Witmark & Sons v. Calloway.M. Witmark & Sons v. Calloway, 22 F. 2d 412, 415 (1927). Beyond the master-servant context, however, courts have extended liability to those who profit from infringing activity when an enterprise has the right and ability to prevent the infringement. Under Dreamland Ball Room v. Shapiro, Bernstein & Co., > “[T]he owner of a dance hall at whose place copyrighted musical compositions > are played in violation of the rights of the copyright holder is liable, if > the playing be for the profit of the proprietor of the dance hall. And this > is so even though the orchestra be employed under a contract that would > ordinarily make it an independent contractor.” By contrast, courts did not extend liability to landlords who leased premises to a direct infringer for a fixed rental and did not participate directly in organizing or soliciting the infringing activity. For example, Deutsch v. Arnold,Deutsch v. Arnold, 98 F. 2d 686 (1938). Fonovisa v. Cherry AuctionFonovisa v. Cherry Auction, 76 F. 3d 259 (9th Cir. 1996). (extending liability to the operator of a swap meet who repeatedly leased booth space to concessionaires selling infringing tapes).Julie E. Cohen, Lydia Pallas Loren, Ruth L. Okediji, and Maureen A. O'Rourke (2006). Copyright in a Global Information Economy, p. 481, Aspen Publishers, New York. The landmark case on vicarious liability for sales of counterfeit recordings is Shapiro, Bernstein and Co. v. H.L. Green Co. In Shapiro, the court was faced with a copyright infringement suit against the owner of a chain of department stores where a concessionaire was selling counterfeit recordings. The Shapiro court ultimately imposed liability, even though the defendant was unaware of the infringement, reasoning that the store proprietor had the power to cease the conduct of the concessionaire, and because the proprietor obtained direct financial benefit from the infringement. =Contributory liability= Contributory liability or contributory infringement has been widely defined as a form of liability on the part of someone who is not directly infringing but nevertheless is making contributions to the infringing acts of others. Material contributions to the act (or enabling thereof), as well as knowledge of the act itself, are key elements of contributory liability. Additionally, in the course of performing such material contributions, the parties know that they are materially infringing copyrighted content. Contributory liability is rooted in the tort theory of enterprise liability. Contributory liability holds the third party liable for the primary act based on the third party's relationship with the actual harm - either by enabling or by benefiting from it. As the court stated in Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.: “one who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes, or materially contributes … may be held liable as a contributory infringer.”Gershwin Publ’g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt., 443 F. 2d 1159 (2d Cir. 1971). Not long after the passage of the 1976 Copyright Act, the scope of contributory infringement liability was tested in a case in which the copyright owners claimed that the sale of a recording device – the VCR - illegally contributed to infringement. In Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984). was established a variant on contributory liability claims with respect to technologies. When Universal City Studios initially sued Sony for making and selling the Betamax, the theory was that Sony materially contributed to acts of infringement performed by users of the Betamax, and knew or had reason to know that the technology would be used for infringing purposes. The Supreme Court of the United States held that, even though material contributions and knowledge of the infringement are generally sufficient to establish secondary liability, in the case of infringing technology, contributory liability cannot be imposed unless the technology lacks substantial non-infringing uses. As the Court phrased the Sony exception with regard to new technologies: \\"The sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.\\" Liability of internet service providers (ISPs) Regarding internet communications, sometimes the most promising remedy is only available from the standpoint of the internet intermediary (e.g. delete the post, take down the link). In fact, the internet is a special field for secondary liability, because the open architecture of the internet facilitates many communications and users need intermediaries in order to access and contact each other's services. The question of whether Internet service providers (ISPs) should be held liable for the actions of network users is unresolved.See K. A. Taipale, Secondary Liability on the Internet: Towards a Performative Standard for Constitutive Responsibility, Center for Advanced Studies Working Paper No. 04-2003 (2003). As to copyright, however, ISPs remain liable, in all territories, as primary, direct infringers of copyright for the copies they make on behalf of their customers, so the issue of additional secondary liability is less significant. An ISP's direct liability arises from the ISP's own actions, not the actions of another party. The confusion arises from the fact that two parties are directly liable in the usual case of internet infringement: the ISP and the ISP's customer. In legal terms, they are joint tortfeasors. This is because they both independently commit all of the acts necessary to establish liability under the copyright laws of most jurisdictions. In situations truly involving secondary liability, the party whose secondary liability is claimed has at least not committed one element required for an infringement action. This situation is not present in the usual ISP situation, as the ISP is always in the position of making copies (without authorization of the rights owner), so it is irrelevant that someone else has infringed the same copyright earlier in time. The ISP's liability is direct, not derivative. It is based on the ISP's own actions, not on someone else's. Recent statutes in the United States (Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998) and the European Union have provided significant, though not total, immunity from primary copyright liability that, in the absence of those statutes, would exist for ISPs.See D. Panethiere,The Basis for Copyright Infringement Liability: The Law in Common Law Jurisdictions, 13 European Intellectual Property Review 26 (1998). The DMCA states four safe harbors: (a) Transitory network communications (b) System caching (c) Information storage and (d) Information location tools.17 U.S.C. §512 The last three have so called “notice & take down” rules for specificity in notice of infringement, counter-notice and put-back and liability if false notice has been given. In order to be eligible for the safe harbor provisions, it is required that the service provider has adopted and reasonably implemented a policy to terminate the accounts of repetitive infringers. In addition, ISPs must accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their works. As to trademarks, in the absence of statutory guidance, courts have extended both types of secondary liability (vicarious and contributory) to third parties, including in some circumstances ISPs. Here, too, the question whether ISPs will be held liable for the acts of their infringing customers will depend on the degree of the ISP's knowledge and involvement in the specific infringing activity.See Jane Coleman, Secondary Trademark Infringement: A Short Treatise on Contributory and Vicarious Infringement in Trademark (Revised, Sept. 2010). Secondary liability in the future? Future treatment of secondary liability by US courts is uncertain. Some cases and commentators have argued for broadening secondary liability through cost-benefit analysis, multi-factor balancing tests, or simply basing it on technical designs or business models.Pamela Samuelson, Preliminary Thoughts on Copyright Reform, Utah Law Review (2007); UC Berkeley Public Law Research Paper No. 1002676. The proposed EU directive would make aiding and abetting infringement a basis for liability. In light of the above, it is permissible to conclude that there is no consensus on this issue.

W. S. Barrow, ‘Stewart family (per. c.1110–c.1350)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.9 April 1327) was the 6th Hereditary High Steward of Scotland and was the father of King Robert II of Scotland, the first Stewart monarch. Origins He was born at Bathgate Castle, West Lothian, Scotland, the eldest son and heir of James Stewart, 5th High Steward of Scotland (c.1260-1309) by his third wife Giles (Latinised to Egidia) de Burgh, a daughter of the Irish nobleman Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster.Cal.Doc Scot. vol ii, no 847Walter's mother is sometimes identified erroneously as Cecily or Cecilia de Dunbar, his father's first wife Career At the age of 21 Walter fought against the English at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314Simpson, David, The Genealogical and Chronological History of the Stuarts, Edinburgh, 1713. where according to some sources, together with Douglas he commanded the left wing of the Scots' army,Anderson, William, The Scottish Nation, Edinburgh, 1867, vol.ix, p.513, states he was 21 years of age at Bannockburn. but according to other sources was (due to his youth and inexperience) merely the nominal leader of one of the four (or threePeter Traquair Freedom's Sword) Scottish schiltrons, the effective leader being his cousin James Douglas, Lord of Douglas.John Prebble The Lion in the North For his services at Bannockburn, Walter was appointed Warden of the Western Marches and was rewarded with a grant of the lands of Largs, which had been forfeited by King John Balliol. In 1316 Stewart donated those lands to Paisley Abbey. Following the liberation of King Robert the Bruce's wife, Elizabeth de Burgh, and daughter Marjorie, from their long captivity in England, Walter the High Steward was sent to receive them at the Anglo-Scottish Border and conduct them back to the Scottish royal court. He later married Marjorie, receiving the Barony of Bathgate in Linlithgowshire as part of his wife's dowry. During the absence of King Robert the Bruce in Ireland, Walter the High Steward and Sir James Douglas managed government affairs and spent much time defending the Scottish Borders. Upon the capture of Berwick-upon-Tweed from the English in 1318 he took command of the town which subsequently on 24 July 1319 was besieged by King Edward II of England. Several of the siege engines were destroyed by the Scots' garrison whereupon Walter the Steward suddenly rushed in force from the walled town to drive off the enemy. In 1322, with Douglas and Thomas Randolph, he made an attempt to surprise the English king at Byland Abbey, near Malton in Yorkshire, but Edward escaped, pursued towards York by Walter the Steward and 500 horsemen. In about 1320/26 Walter, Steward of Scotland, granted by charter to John St. Clair, his valet, the lands of Maxton, Roxburghshire, one of the witnesses being Roberto de Lauwedir tunc justiciario Laudonie (\\"Robert de Lauder, then Justiciar of Lothian\\").Angus, William, editor, Miscellaneous Charters 1315-1401, in Miscellany of The Scottish History Society, vol.5, 1933, p.9. Marriages and children He married twice: *Firstly in 1315 to Princess Marjorie, the only daughter of King Robert I of Scotland by his first wife Isabella of Mar. By Marjorie he had one son: **King Robert II of Scotland (born 1316-died 1390), the first monarch of the House of Stewart who reigned as King of Scotland from 1371 to his death in 1390. *Secondly he married Isabel de Graham, believed to have been a daughter of Sir John Graham of Abercorn, by whom he had three further children: **John Stewart of Ralston of Ralston, Renfrewshire or Cunninghame. **Sir Andrew Stewart, knight. **Egidia Stewart, who married three times: firstly to Sir James Lindsay of Crawford Castle; secondly to Sir Hugh Eglinton; and thirdly to Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith. Death and burial He died on 9 April 1326 at Bathgate Castle and was buried in the Abbey Church of Paisley, alongside his first wife, Marjorie Bruce, and his five High Steward ancestors.

It is similar to the Colombian and Venezuelan arepa. Gordita means \\"chubby\\" in Spanish. There are two main variations of this dish, one which is typically fried in a deep wok-shaped comal, consumed mostly in central and southern Mexico, and another one baked on a regular comal. The most common and representative variation of this dish is the \\"gordita de chicharrón\\", filled with chicharron (a spiced stew of pork rind) which is widely consumed throughout Mexico. Gorditas are often eaten as a lunch dish and accompanied by several types of sauce. A gordita is typically prepared as a thick tortilla. The dough is most commonly made of nixtamalized corn flour, as also used for tortillas, but can also be of wheat flour, particularly in northern Mexico close to the U.S border. An old variant of corn gorditas uses masa quebrada (broken dough) where the cornmeal is coarsely ground, leaving bits of broken grain. In the deep-fried version, once the masa has been prepared, it is separated in small portions, then each one is filled with meat, and shaped like an oblong disc. The pastry is immersed in boiling oil until golden and crispy on the outside. After cooking, the gordita is allowed to stand to drain excess oil, then a small slit is cut into one side to allow vapor and excessive heat to release, and lime juice and salsa are poured inside, which gives the gordita its characteristic flavor. In some regions of Mexico, the slit is also used to stuff additional ingredients, mostly dressings such as fresh cheese, nopal salad, tomatoes, guacamole, potatoes, beans or rajas (sautéed strips of chile). By tradition, gorditas are filled with chicharron, but there are local variations which substitute it by chicken stew, shredded beef, carne al pastor, eggs with chorizo sausage, carnitas or picadillo. The baked version is prepared almost identically to the preparation of a common tortilla, except it is thicker. When the masa is prepared, chicharrón is mixed directly in the dough, instead of being added later. Shaped like a flat circle, then it is placed in a comal until cooked, in most cases not adding additional oil. When slit and filled, this gordita looks like a sandwich made with tortillas instead of bread. This variation is known as Gordita de migas. Regional variations A Veracruz-style gordita, typical of East Coast of Mexico In central Mexico, gorditas commonly range from being relatively small, but bulky (about the size of a child's fist), to about the diameter of a \\"regular\\" tortilla. In northern Mexico they tend to be larger and flatter. In most cases gorditas are shallow-fried with vegetable oil in a deep comal, but they can also be deep-fried, making the outside crisper. In Durango and other states of Northern Mexico, gorditas are commonly made from wheat flour and look like small pita breads. The dough (masa) is identical to that of a wheat flour tortilla. It is cooked on a comal with a hot piece of metal placed on top that resembles a clothes iron. The gordita fills with steam, and a small slit is cut into one side where it can be filled with guisados. Similar dishes *The Salvadoran dish pupusa is similar to a gordita, except completely sealed and typically served with curtido, a lightly pickled cabbage relish. *In Venezuela and Colombia an arepa (a type of cornbread) is often served stuffed with various ingredients. It is prepared in a similar way as a Mexican gordita, except the final dish is smaller and slimmer. Other gorditas Gorditas de azúcar (sugar gorditas) The fast food restaurant chain Taco Bell offers a wheat flour gordita that has limited similarity to gorditas as served in Mexico and is more akin to a pita bread taco. In eastern and central Mexico \\"gorditas de nata\\" (cream gorditas) are consumed often as a breakfast dish or snack. It is a sweet cake similar to a tiny but extremely thick pancake made with milk cream or clotted cream, called nata in Mexico, cinnamon, sugar, and white wheat flour. They are named \\"gordita\\" too, due to their appearance, similar to the original fried gordita, but their taste is sweet, not salty. Besides their appearance, this snack is not related to the original one. The same flour preparation used to prepare gorditas de nata is also used to cook a flat cookie variation, which by extension it is also called \\"gordita\\", but in contrast, it is thin and crispy, not thick. To differentiate them, these flat cookies are called \\"sugar gorditas\\" instead.

With Zimmermann the double 'n' Zimmermann was often seen as redundant in countries where English was spoken. As a part of routine, German names were often Anglicized or simplified later by immigrants to better fit in. Zimmerman became Carpenter for example.

At in height, it is the tallest indoor roller coaster in the world as of 2020. Layout Mindbender was designed by Germany's Werner Stengel and built by Anton Schwarzkopf. It was inspired by this team's previous design, Dreier Looping, a portable coaster that travelled the German funfair circuit, before being sold to a succession of amusement parks in Malaysia, Great Britain, and most recently, Mexico. Mindbender is a pseudo mirror-image of Dreier Looping, and is slightly taller, with additional helices at the end of the ride. Mindbender features shorter trains, with three pilot cars, whereas Dreier Looping usually ran with five trailer cars and one pilot car, occasionally rising to seven-car trains at busy funfairs. The ride's layout features many twisting drops, three vertical loops and a double upward helix finale. The ride twists underneath, in between and around its supports. It also goes underneath the former UFO Maze attraction, which has been removed to make way for another roller coaster; Gerstlauer's Galaxy Orbiter, during the helix. Often in high season, the last car on one of the trains is reversed, allowing guests to ride the roller coaster without being able to see where they are going.  Ride experience  After boarding the Mindbender, riders put on their seatbelt and lap restraints. Also, the ride operator lowers large shoulder restraints over the riders. All of the restraints keep the riders firmly secured in the seat. After ascending the curving wheel driven lift hill, the train descends a sharp, twisting left-hand drop (sometimes referred to as a Traver drop) that climbs back up to the first of four stacked block brakes. The train negotiates a second left-hand drop that is immediately followed by the first two vertical loops. Then the train repeats the aforementioned process: it goes up to the third block brake, then does another twisting drop and ascent before hitting the fourth block brake. After the fourth block brake, the track drops to the left and back down to ground level, and hits the third vertical loop. Following the third loop, the coaster train does another cycle under the stacked block brakes, then shoots along a two-layered upward helix, before running behind the Galaxy Quest 7D theater to hit the final brake run and the exit/entry area. The ride length from the initial drop should normally range from one minute, five seconds, to one minute, twenty-five seconds. Circuit times as little as 59 seconds are possible through extensive waxing of the track, and reduction in tension on the bogey wheels. This increase in speed is not permitted during public rides, as the forces on the riders becomes severe. During testing of the renovated trains in 1987, the maximum g-force of a normal run was measured on equipment bolted into the train at 5.5 G's, which occurs in the second loop. 1986 accident On the evening of 14 June 1986, the fourth car of a train traveling midway along the course derailed before encountering the third and final loop. Its wheel assembly had become detached from both the track and car itself, causing the car to sway back and forth across the tracks. The car became damaged, and the lap bar restraints unlocked and released, throwing all four of its passengers to the concrete floor below. The train continued to move along the track and into the final loop, but friction from the car's derailment slowed the train and prevented it from clearing the loop. As it rolled backward down the loop, the detached car crashed into a concrete pillar about midway down, stopping the train abruptly. Three of the four passengers thrown from the ride died, while the fourth was left critically injured with permanent, life-altering effects. The remaining passengers were safely evacuated and treated at a nearby hospital with minor injuries. An investigation later determined that four cap screws holding the wheel assembly together failed, which were likely the result of design flaws and unsatisfactory maintenance routines. When Mindbender reopened in January 1987, the trains were redesigned. The existing four-car trains were converted to three-car trains (reducing seating capacity from 16 to 12), and anti-roll back features were installed. Each train previously consisted of two wheel assemblies per car, however after this accident, two further wheel assemblies were added to each car. The lap bar restraint was retained, but seat belts and shoulder headrests were added.

It was devoted to health care, focusing on the human body, physical fitness, medicine and nutrition. Attractions included Body Wars and Cranium Command. It is located inside a golden colored dome between Mission: SPACE and the Universe of Energy. It opened on October 19, 1989, and closed on January 1, 2007. From 2007 to 2018, the Pavilion acted as EPCOT's Festival Center, before becoming a construction site in March 2019 in preparation for the upcoming Play! pavilion to replace it. The original attractions within the building have been closed and partially removed. In February 2019, it was announced that a new Play! pavilion would be built in the domed show building formerly occupied by Wonders of Life, and is scheduled to open in time for Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary in 2021. History The idea of a pavilion devoted to health and fitness dates back to the original concept of the EPCOT Center theme park, but no corporate sponsor could be found to cover the costs. It was not until MetLife signed on that the pavilion was finally constructed, and it featured two main attractions: Cranium Command and Body Wars, the first thrill ride located in EPCOT. Also featured was a theater (home to The Making of Me), restaurant and interactive attractions that evolved around the idea of health and wellness. MetLife ended its sponsorship in 2001, which led to the slow decline of the pavilion. On January 4, 2004, Disney made the decision to make it seasonal operation only. It reopened when the park was projected to hit near capacity during the high spring months and Christmas season. Its most recent operational phase was November 26, 2006, through January 1, 2007. In 2007, the pavilion closed permanently, with no official reason given. While it is not operational to the public, it is still commonly used for private and corporate events. In 2007, temporary walls were placed around the existing attractions when Epcot hosted the Food and Wine festival in the pavilion. The \\"Body Wars\\" sign was removed in 2008, replaced by a temporary Garden Town sign while the imprints from the original marquee were painted over. By 2009, significant portions of the Body Wars attraction had been removed. The \\"Celebrate the Joy of Life\\" sign was removed following in 2009, while most of the exhibits left were removed. The pavilion also received a paint job inside using mute colors such as white and light green. The pavilion then operated seasonally as the center for the Epcot International Flower and Garden Festival and the Epcot International Food & Wine Festival as the Festival Center. For those events, it hosted seminars, videos, presentations, and more. It was used as a central merchandise location during the two festivals as well. All attractions are shut down and their signs have been removed. As of November 2014, the Body Wars ride simulators have been dismantled. The queue still exists, but most of the props and other electronics have been removed. As of 2017, Cranium Command has had its queue and pre-show partially dismantled, but the theater - including the animatronics, lighting, seats, and staging area - remains intact. The theater that was used for The Making of Me is still used for various movies and presentations during the event. On September 11, 2012, Walt Disney Imagineering filed a notice of commencement with the Orange County Comptroller’s office indicating the intentions for a \\"selective demolition\\" to take place at the pavilion. In February 2019, it was announced that a new interactive pavilion would be built in the dome formerly occupied by Wonders of Life. The pavilion is scheduled to open in time for Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary in 2021. Attractions * Cranium Command - A theater show with audio-animatronic actors and a movie. The show explained the functions of the brain and its interaction with the human body. * Frontiers of Medicine - Listen to stories about medicine and the brain on small televisions. * Body Wars - A motion simulator ride taking guests on a Fantastic Voyage-like trip through the heart, lungs, and brain. The film shown was directed by Leonard Nimoy, and starred actors Tim Matheson, Elisabeth Shue, and Dakin Matthews.

The pavilion is themed as an underwater exploration base called SeaBase Alpha, with several exhibits devoted to oceanic study. The pavilion opened in 1986, but had been planned as part of the park since its opening in 1982. The Seas with Nemo & Friends is located in Future World West, which is planned to be re-designated World Nature. HistoryThe Living Seas (1986-2006)= The Living Seas opened to the public on January 15, 1986. It housed the largest saltwater tank in the world at its completion, holding of water, but was surpassed in 2005 with the opening of the Georgia Aquarium. The concept of the building was to take visitors under the ocean to \\"Sea Base Alpha\\". Guests viewed a short movie about the formation of the oceans entitled The Sea, which was followed by an elevator ride to the ocean floor aboard a \\"Hydrolator\\" (in reality, guests rode a stationary hydraulic elevator while moving walls, sound effects and a vibrating floor gave the effect of traveling a long distance downward ). Guests then boarded a Seacab on the Caribbean Coral Reef Ride, and rode through the middle of the tank. They then disembarked into the main exhibit area where they could interact with various multimedia displays. Once finished, guests leaving the pavilion would then board another Hydrolator to the surface (which, similar to the first set of elevators, simulated upward motion). The Living Seas was sponsored by United Technologies from its opening until 1998. After the departure of United Technologies as sponsor of The Living Seas, significant changes were made to the pavilion. All sponsorship references were removed from the pavilion. Preshow theatre #2 was removed and a corridor was built through its space, allowing for guests to bypass the preshow if they wished to go directly to the Hydrolators. On October 21, 2001, as a result of declining patronage following the September 11 attacks, the Seacabs closed down and were walled off. The queue of the Seacab ride was left intact and the Seacabs were still visible to guests through the ocean tank windows. Reasons for their closure are not entirely known. After they closed, guests leaving the Hydrolators walked along the former wheelchair bypass corridor to Sea Base Alpha. Now, guests had the option of viewing the preshow or going directly to the Hydrolators and simply walking to Sea Base Alpha. =The Seas with Nemo & Friends (2006-present)= In December 2003, Disney began to re-theme The Living Seas into a new pavilion based on the recently released Pixar film Finding Nemo. The majority of the transformation began with exterior elements, but in January 2004, the interior began to change as well. On November 16, 2004, Turtle Talk with Crush opened in what was once Module 1C, or the Earth Systems exhibit. The show's unexpected success overwhelmed the pavilion, causing the development of plans to move Turtle Talk with Crush to a larger area in the pavilion. Turtle Talk with Crush was only the beginning of changes to The Living Seas. On August 21, 2005, The Living Seas closed for its transformation into The Seas with Nemo & Friends. Parts of the pavilion reopened in late November 2005. Outside the pavilion, the facade and mural were changed and depictions of sea life seen in Finding Nemo were added. The exit Hydrolators had been removed, and were replaced with glass doors that served as an exit and temporary entrance. Sea Base Alpha had been re-themed to Finding Nemo and the entire original preshow area was in the process of being rebuilt. Decor and signage was replaced and scientific displays were replaced by ones themed to Finding Nemo. Turtle Talk with Crush remained as popular as it was before the transformation. Throughout 2006, construction walls hid the preshow area which was undergoing reconstruction. With the former Sea Base Alpha open, work progressed on the new queue areas and the Seacabs were being rebuilt as a new \\"Clamobile\\" attraction. The remaining Living Seas preshow theater, entrance Hydrolators, holding areas, and Seacabs queue were all completely removed and replaced by a new themed queue area. Hydrolator Three and Theater 1 were replaced by a number of new dark ride sets. The former Seacabs ride was lengthened by through the space formerly used by the preshow theatre, but the final section still took place inside the tank. A new projection technology was added to the tank and the new show scenes. The existing Seacabs were given a clamshell shape and renamed \\"Clamobiles\\". Three Audio-Animatronic seagulls were also added to the entrance. They periodically flap their wings and say \\"Mine! Mine! Mine!\\", just like the seagulls do in Finding Nemo. On October 10, 2006, the construction walls in front of the entrance to The Living Seas, now The Seas with Nemo & Friends, were removed. The temporary entrance was removed from the exit. Turtle Talk With Crush was removed from Module 1C, and relocated to the second preshow theater, which had been unused since 1999 when it had been broken up by the bypass corridor following United Technologies' discontinuation of sponsorship. Module 1A was turned into a pre-show space for the expanded Turtle Talk With Crush, with its exhibits moving to 1C, while a new queue line corridor was built from the module into the existing theater space using a backstage fire exit. The Seas with Nemo & Friends was rededicated on January 24, 2007. It was the first Epcot Pavilion to be based on a Disney animated movie property and only the second Epcot attraction to do so (The Lion King- based Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable at The Land Pavilion was the first, opening in 1995 replacing Symbiosis). In late 2019, new directory signage was installed in Seabase Alpha, restoring the former Living Seas logo. =Consultants and advisers= * Dr. Robert Ballard, Senior Scientist, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution * Dr. Sylvia Earle, Vice President, Ocean Engineering, Inc. * Mr. Gilbert Grosvenor, President, National Geographic Society * Dr. Murray Newman, Director, Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre * Professor William Nierenberg, Director, Scripps Institution of Oceanography * Dr. David Potter, Vice President, Public Affairs, General Motors Corporation * Dr. John Ryther, Director, Division of Applied Biology, Harbor Branch Foundation, Inc. * Mr. Robert Wildman, Deputy Director, NOAA, Office of Sea Grants Program PavilionAttractions= * The Seas with Nemo & Friends — Guests board \\"Clamobiles\\" and venture into the sea to join Marlin, Dory, and other characters from the film Finding Nemo, as they search for Nemo who has gotten lost again. Guests first journey through a coral reef where they find Marlin, a clownfish, searching for Nemo. Farther along the reef, they come across Mr. Ray and his students, setting out to explore and look for Nemo. Dory soon joins Marlin in the search and they come upon a group of jellyfish. An anglerfish comes out of the darkness and begins to chase them frantically. Guests dive deeper and come upon the wreck of a massive submarine that sits in the center of a deadly minefield. Peeking out from the wreck is Bruce, a great white shark, and Chum, a mako shark, trying to coax Nemo out from his hiding spot. (Anchor, a hammerhead shark is not included in the ride.) They assure him in their sneaky voices that fish are friends, not food. The Clamobiles are then swept up into the East Australian Current with Nemo, Crush, and Squirt. The current empties the guests out into a massive aquarium where Nemo is reunited once again with his friends. As they sing a closing song, \\"In the Big Blue World\\" (although the ride opened first, this song was adapted from the Disney's Animal Kingdom show Finding Nemo - The Musical), these animated Pixar characters swim in the actual aquarium with real fish through the use of special effect glass. The Clamobiles then return to the surface. * Sea Base — Main viewing area of the aquarium. A smaller aquarium features a pair of rescued West Indian manatees. Other small tanks feature a variety of species from moray eels to seahorses, and other species that cannot interact with divers or other fish in the main exhibit. A large, cylindrical tank in which guests can view from the center exhibits a pod of three Common bottlenose dolphins in one corner. The other three quarters of the exhibit hold a wide array of species, including Sand tiger sharks, Naso tang, Threadfin butterflyfish, Cowtail stingray, Orange-lined triggerfish, Sandbar sharks, Bowmouth guitarfish, Bonnethead sharks, Atlantic tarpon, Shovelnose guitarfish, a Green sea turtle, a Blacknose shark, and a Zebra shark. * Turtle Talk with Crush — An interactive show with the sea turtle from Finding Nemo who answers children's questions about the sea. The show now features characters from the movie Finding Dory. =Restaurants= * Coral Reef Restaurant — A table service restaurant.

It is located near Victoria Park Avenue and Danforth Avenue. It mainly consists of high-rise apartment complexes, built originally to take advantage of the opening of the adjacent Victoria Park subway station, which connects to the central quadrangle via a partially covered walkway. History Crescent Town was founded in 1887 when Walter Massey, the son of Hart Massey, Canada's first major industrialist, purchased a 240-acre (1 km²) country property centered on Dawes Road and Victoria Park Avenue. The Massey farm was named Dentonia after Mrs. Massey's family whose surname was Denton. The Massey farm sold fresh eggs and poultry as well as fresh trout which was caught in the many streams and rivulets that criss-crossed the farm. The Massey farm was also the home of the City Dairy Company which produced the first pasteurized milk in Canada. In 1933, Susan Massey generously gave 40 acres (160,000 m²) of the Dentonia farm to Crescent School where her grandsons were educated. Crescent School operated at Dentonia until 1969 when this property was sold to the developers who built the present day Crescent Town neighbourhood. Hollywood actor Kiefer Sutherland of the television series 24 was a Crescent Town resident. He spent part of his childhood in Crescent Town and attended the Crescent Town Elementary School, where he first met former Mayor of Toronto, David Miller.http://www.torontoneighbourhoods.net/neighbourhoods/east-york/crescent- town/history Current status Crescent Town is considered by some as an interesting experiment in community planning in that all of its pedestrian walkways are located above the street level. It is a multicultural neighbourhood, whose population includes extensive numbers of Bangladeshi, Indian, Jamaican, Pakistani and Tamil Canadians. There are many Bangladeshi- owned businesses near the neighbourhood (Victoria Park-Danforth).

The pavilion is dedicated to human interaction with the Earth, focusing on agriculture and travel. It opened on October 1, 1982, as part of the Phase I features for the grand opening of what was then known as EPCOT Center. \\"The Land\\" dedicated to human interaction with the land itself. It explores how humans can both use the land for their benefit, and how they can also destroy it. Future Technology in better preserving the land is also explored in the pavilion, along with a focus on the celebration of the land itself. The 24 hectare (2.5 million square foot) facility features four attractions; Soarin' Around the World, Living with the Land, Awesome Planet, and Behind the Seeds Tour. The Land is located in Future World West, which is planned to be re- designated World Nature. History The Land Pavilion Plants Growing in the greenhouse, as seen from Living with the Land. While \\"The Land\\" pavilion has existed since 1982, it has gone through three significant phases. The pavilion's first incarnation involved a ten-year sponsorship under Kraft Foods Inc. from 1982-1992\\\\. Kraft played a vital role in co-financing the everyday functions of the attractions, restaurants, and shops inside the pavilion. The pavilion's interior and exterior design featured earth tone colors and exotic plant life. In 1993, plans were made to update and modernize the overall tone of EPCOT Center, including a major refurbishment of \\"The Land\\" pavilion. Kraft withdrew its sponsorship on September 26, 1993, with Nestlé taking its place. Co-financed by Nestlé and the Walt Disney World Resort, a gradual refurbishment of the pavilion began on September 27, 1993. The pavilion itself was cosmetically freshened. While some of the original design elements remained, the addition of more vibrant colors and fabrics to the various restaurants and shops gave the pavilion a more modern and refreshed look. The names of certain shops, restaurants, and attractions also changed during this time. The pavilion's main attraction, Listen to the Land, which took guests on connected boats through various exhibits within the pavilion, reopened mostly unchanged as Living with the Land on December 10, 1993. The Kitchen Kabaret Revue, another of the pavilion's original attractions featuring an Audio- Animatronics presentation about nutrition, closed on January 3, 1994. It was replaced with a new show titled Food Rocks, which featured some of the elements from the original show with an updated presentation intended to be more modern and appealing to younger audiences. Symbiosis, the last of \\"The Land\\"'s three original attractions, was closed on January 1, 1995. This attraction, which was a cinematic presentation that discussed both the positive and negative aspects of human relationship with the land, eventually reopened as Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable, a new film featuring characters from The Lion King. Like the Food Rocks show, this new attraction recycled some of the elements of its predecessor, and was intended to be another refreshed and modernized feature of \\"The Land\\" that would better appeal to younger audiences. In 2003, Nestlé renewed its sponsorship of \\"The Land\\"; however, it was under agreement that Nestlé would oversee its own refurbishment to both the interior and exterior of the conservatory-style pavilion. Between 2004 and 2005, the pavilion underwent its second major refurbishment. It received a new color scheme featuring a vibrant selection of white, yellow, and green. New foliage was added to complement the existing greenery. The walkways and stroller parking to the pavilion's entrance were redefined and widened. All of the carpeting in the pavilion was replaced, and the main food court was completely redesigned. The pavilion's signage was updated, incorporating the new color scheme, new typography, and a modernized logotype. The pavilion's original dedication plaque remained unchanged. The most significant change to \\"The Land\\" during its 2004-2005 refurbishment was the closure and entire demolition of Food Rocks, which initially occurred on January 3, 2004. Taking its place would be Soarin', a major attraction that was originally designed and built for Disney California Adventure Park. Simulating the experience of hang gliding over various landscapes, Soarin's massive movie screens and ride mechanics required the construction of a large physical addition to the pavilion itself. \\"The Land\\" officially reopened on May 5, 2005, which coincided with the start of Disney's Happiest Celebration on Earth Campaign. While \\"The Land\\" as a pavilion has somewhat changed, its purpose has not, and it remains a positive and serious experience featuring elements from all three of its phases, allowing today's guests to experience all that \\"The Land\\" has to offer. On February 13, 2009, Nestlé pulled out of sponsorship, leaving \\"The Land\\" without a sponsor. \\"Living with the Land\\" was closed for a vehicle update from August 2, 2009, to October 2, 2009. This update increased passenger capacity from 36 to 40 guests per vehicle. Newer, more wheelchair-friendly vehicles were also a new addition. On July 29, 2011, Chiquita signed on as the new sponsor for the ride Living with the Land. However, it is not mentioned in-ride by the narrator (Mike Brassell) nor does it have a VIP lounge in The Land building itself. =Horticulture research= In addition to being an entertainment venue, \\"The Land\\" is also a demonstration, production, and research facility. 43,000 ft² (0.4 hectares) of the pavilion are dedicated to experimental horticulture techniques in hydroponics, irrigation methods, and integrated pest management. =Services= Entrance to Soarin' Current attractions * Soarin' Around the World—A flight motion simulator that takes guests hang gliding over various regions of the world including the Great Wall of China, Monument Valley, Great Pyramids of Egypt, Sydney Harbour, and the plains of Africa. * Living with the Land—A narrated boat tour about ecology and agriculture that takes guests through an indoor dark ride portion and an outdoor greenhouse and hydroponics lab, revealing the crops and animals cultivated for use at Epcot. *Awesome Planet—A 4D film about the Earth's biomes and the perils of climate change, with narration by Ty Burrell. * Behind the Seeds Tour—For an extra fee, an approximately 1 hour long tour of the research facility that explains what is being researched, and how the research is conducted.

Kevin Gilbertson, a web developer, launched the service in January 2002 as a way to post links in newsgroup postings which frequently had long, cumbersome addresses.  Service  The TinyURL homepage includes a form which is used to submit a long URL for shortening. For each URL entered, the server adds a new alias in its hashed database and returns a short URL. According to the website, the shortened URLs will never expire. TinyURL offers an API which allows applications to automatically create short URLs. This is done by simply reading the result returned from \`tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url=URLENCODED_SOURCE_URL\`. Short URL aliases are seen as useful because they are easier to write down, remember or distribute. They also fit in text boxes with a limited number of characters allowed. Some examples of limited text boxes are IRC channel topics, email signatures, microblogs, certain printed newspapers (such as .net magazine or even Nature), and email clients that impose line breaks on messages at a certain length. Starting in 2008, TinyURL allowed users to create custom, more meaningful aliases. This means that a user can create descriptive URLs rather than a randomly generated address. For example, \`https://tinyurl.com/wp-tinyurl\` leads to the Wikipedia article about the website. =Preview short URLs= To preview the full URL from the short TinyURL, the user can visit TinyURL first and enable previews as a default browser cookie setting or copy and paste the short URL into the browser address bar, and prepend the short \`tinyurl.com/x\` with \`preview.tinyurl.com/x\`.

According to an introduction that Scott wrote in 1829, he had originally intended to write a story of the supernatural, but changed his mind soon after starting. The book was a huge success, the first edition selling out on the first day of publication. Composition Scott began the composition of Guy Mannering in the last days of 1814, immediately after completing his last long narrative poem The Lord of the Isles. Writing with remarkable speed, he finished it by mid-February 1815.Walter Scott, Guy Mannering, ed. P. D. Garside (Edinburgh, 1999), 357. Editions Guy Mannering appeared in three volumes in Edinburgh, published by Archibald Constable and Co. The print run was 2000, and the selling price one guinea (£1.05). The London publishers were Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, who had to wait some days before receiving their consignment of 1500 copies by sea, anticipated by copies sent down via the faster road route by Edinburgh publishers.For a full discussion of the early editions see ibid., 369–70, 391–410. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827, publication was anonymous. The first edition was followed by a further 5,000 copies in March and May, the second and third editions. There is no clear evidence for authorial involvement in these, or in any of the novel's subsequent appearances except for the 18mo Novels and Tales (1823) and the \\"Magnum\\" edition. Some of the small changes to the text in 1823 are attributable to Scott, but that edition was a textual dead end. At the beginning of 1828 he provided the novel with an introduction and notes, and revised the text, for the Magnum edition in which it appeared as Volumes 3 and 4 in August and September 1829. The standard modern edition, by P. D. Garside, was published as Volume 2 of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 1999: this is based on the first edition; the Magnum material appears in Volume 25a. Plot background Guy Mannering is set in the 1760s to 1780s, mostly in the Galloway area of southwest Scotland, but with episodes in Cumberland, Holland, and India. It tells the story of Henry \\"Harry\\" Bertram, the son of the Laird of Ellangowan, who is kidnapped at the age of five by smugglers after witnessing the murder of a customs officer. It follows the fortunes and adventures of Harry and his family in subsequent years, and the struggle over the inheritance of Ellangowan. The novel also depicts the lawlessness that existed at the time, when smugglers operated along the coast and thieves frequented the country roads. Plot summary Guy Mannering, after leaving Oxford, is travelling alone in southwestern Scotland, on the coast of the Solway Firth. After losing his way at nightfall, he is directed to Ellangowan, the home of Mr Godfrey Bertram. The friendly but incompetent Bertram welcomes him, although his wife is in labour with their first child. As they await news, Mannering meets Dominie Sampson, a learned but socially inept tutor, and Meg Merrilies, a wild-looking, strident Gypsy woman, who has come to tell the child's fortune. The young student, however, offers to do this from the stars, and predicts that three periods of the boy's life will be very hazardous. Not wishing to concern the parents, he leaves his predictions to be opened when the child is five years old. Mannering also meets smuggler Dirk Hatteraick, who captains vessels active off the wild coast by Ellangowan. However, before his fifth birthday is over, little Harry Bertram disappears while in the care of an excise-man, Kennedy, who is murdered by smugglers. No trace can be found of the child, though Kennedy's body is found at the foot of a cliff. In her distress, his mother goes into labour once again, and after giving birth to a daughter, she dies. Seventeen years elapse, and Mannering, now a Colonel, returns from India and visits Scotland once again. He arrives at Ellangowan in time to be present at the death of the now destitute Godfrey Bertram. The possessions and home of Bertram and his daughter Lucy are being sold. Mannering attempts to buy the estate, but is called back to England to attend to his own daughter who is reported to have a lover, so misses the sale. The Ellangowan estate is purchased at a reduced rate by the conniving Glossin, whose unscrupulous dealings have been one of the causes of the Bertrams' downfall. The estate is sold on the condition that if the male heir is found, the estate will return to the Bertrams. Mannering's daughter Julia has in fact been entertaining the affections of Vanbeest Brown, a young cavalry officer from her father's regiment, though she does not admit this to her father. Brown is unsure of his parentage, having been raised in Holland, and told that though born in Scotland, he was rescued at a young age from smugglers. Colonel Mannering in fact believes that he killed Brown in a duel in India, a fact which weighs heavily on his conscience. (Out of concern that Mannering will disapprove of Brown's low status, Mannering's wife had led him to believe that Brown's affectionate visits were to her, not her daughter. Mannering's wife dies before the truth of the matter is explained.) Mannering brings his daughter with him to Scotland, and rents a house called Woodbourne, not far from Ellangowan. He invites Lucy Bertram to be a companion for his daughter, and Dominie Sampson to be his librarian. Brown follows Julia Mannering to Scotland, taking a roundabout route to explore some of the wilder parts of his birth country. He dines at an inn called Mump's Hall, where he meets a jolly farmer, Dandie Dinmont. Here he also meets Meg Merrilies, who seems to recognise him. The proprietress of Mump's Hall sends thugs to rob Dinmont on the road, and Brown arrives in time to help fend them off. In gratitude Dinmont invites Brown to stay at his farm with his large family (and their many terriers, all called Mustard or Pepper) for some days. While hunting with his new friend, Brown meets a gamekeeper called Gabriel, who also seems to recognise him. Meanwhile, at Woodbourne, a group of excise-men seek protection from a gang of smugglers, who outnumber them. Under the superior tactics of Mannering, the smugglers are driven off, and several of their ringleaders killed or mortally wounded. Proceeding on his wintry journey, Brown becomes lost; following a light, he comes to a ruined hut in a ruined hamlet of Dernclough, in which Meg Merillies is tending a dying man (one of the smugglers), singing incantations to free the soul from the body. She hides Brown, saying the dead man's accomplices will kill him. Brown watches from a cramped hiding place under some straw as the thugs empty his portmanteau and dispose of all his papers, weapons and money. In the morning, Meg shows him the road and gives him her well-ladened purse, exacting at the same time a promise that he will come to her immediately whenever she calls him to do so. He continues on his way. Writing to a friend, Julia makes great fun of the Dominie's peculiarities, and mentions Lucy's discouragement of her suitor, young Hazlewood, because she has no fortune and he is wealthy. Julia then describes with horror the sudden appearance of Brown, who intercepts them on a path through the woods. Hazelwood, nervous from the smugglers' attack, threatens Brown, who tries to disarm him; in the struggle Hazelwood is shot in the shoulder. Brown is now a wanted man and on the run, although Hazelwood acknowledges that the shooting was accidental. The attorney Glossin, now a justice of the peace, is indefatigable in endeavouring to trace Hazelwood's attacker, in the hope of ingratiating himself to the Hazelwood family. He hears with pleasure that the gaoler McGuffog has a man in custody. However, the man is not Brown but Dirk Hatteraick, a Dutch smuggler, known well to Glossin, who has in the past been his accomplice. Hatteraick warns Glossin that Harry Bertram has been seen in Scotland. Glossin engineers Hatteraick's escape from custody, and meets him in a hidden smuggler's cave, close to where Hatteraick caused the death of Kennedy. It is revealed that Glossin was involved with the smugglers who committed the murder, and gave them the child to dispose of. Hatteraick explains that the child was adopted and educated in Holland, and that he has recently been seen by an ex-smuggler, Gabriel, in the local hills. He also reveals that it was Harry Bertram/Brown who injured Hazelwood. Glossin is determined to kill the young heir. An elderly aunt of Lucy Bertram's dies in Edinburgh, generating hope that her fortune may have been left to Lucy. Mannering, accompanied by the Dominie, travels to Edinburgh to place the matter in the advocate Mr Pleydell's hands. He strikes up a lively friendship with Pleydell, but they find that the old lady has left her estate to the heir of Ellangowan, when he is found. They learn from a serving- maid that Meg Merrilies planted the idea that Harry Bertram is alive in the old lady's head. Dandie Dinmont is also there, and his robust honesty earns Mannering's respect, despite the class divide. Harry retreats to Cumberland, and writes to his regiment for replacement papers. He also manages to correspond with Julia, whose letter draws him back to Scotland. He is landed at Ellangowan, and he explores the ruined castle beside the modern estate, finding it strangely familiar. There he encounters Glossin, who promptly has him arrested for shooting Hazlewood, and lodges him in the dismal bridewell (small prison) adjoining the custom-house at Portanferry. Here he is visited, unexpectedly, by Dinmont, who has heard from Gabriel of his being in danger. Dinmont manages to convince McGuffog to allow him to stay the night in Harry's cell. (Harry at this stage still believes himself to be Vanbeest Brown.) Meanwhile, the Colonel has returned from Edinburgh. Meg Merrilies intercepts the Dominie on a ramble, and sends an urgent note by him to Mannering. She also stops young Hazlewood, and tells him to cause the soldiers who have been withdrawn from Portanferry to be sent back there instantly. Glossin has \\"warned\\" Hazelwood's father of an attack on his estate, in order that Portanferry is left unguarded, so that Glossin's men can attack and kill Harry Bertram. During the night the custom-house is fired by a gang of ruffians; strangely, however, Bertram and Dinmont are assisted to escape, and led to a carriage. It later emerges that Gypsy relatives of Meg and Gabriel have infiltrated the party. On the same evening Counsellor Pleydell arrives to visit his new friend Mannering, and Mannering admits that he has sent a carriage to Portanferry on the strength of a note from the old Gypsy woman. They wait impatiently for the arrival of the carriage, unsure whom it will carry. Just as they have given up, the carriage arrives. Mannering is shocked to see Brown, alive; Julia, too, is shocked by her lover's arrival; Lucy is terrified to see the ruffian who injured her lover, Hazelwood, on the road; Sampson thinks he has seen the ghost of Old Bertram. Once things have been explained, Harry Bertram, now acknowledged as the heir of Ellangowan, is tearfully welcomed. Sampson hugs his \\"little Harry\\" with delight, and Mannering, his conscience cleared, welcomes the young man. Lucy embraces her long-lost brother, and Julia confesses her love to her father. thumb At the Kaim of Derncleugh: Guy Mannering Chapter XXVII by N M Price. (c. 1895) However, a legal right to Ellangowan has not been established, and Mannering and Pleydell must organise bail. Meanwhile, Bertram and the two young ladies are walking when Meg Merrilies meets them and demands that Harry come with her. He agrees, and Meg is pleased that Dinmont can accompany him as protector. The women then meet Hazelwood, and send him to follow on horseback. Meg leads the way to the Dernclough hut and arms them, then takes them to the smugglers' cave. Here the three men overcome Hatteraick, but Meg is mortally wounded in the struggle. Hatteraick is imprisoned, and crowds gather at Dernclough, where Meg is dying. They welcome the heir of Ellangowan with delight. Meg's dying revelations, along with testimony from Gabriel, furnish sufficient evidence to arrest Glossin also. In prison, Glossin bribes McGuffog to obtain access to the smuggler's cell to concoct a defence. In fury, Hatteraick kills Glossin, then hangs himself. Having recovered the property of his ancestors, Harry Bertram is able to discharge all his father's debts. With the help of Julia's dowry, he builds a new mansion, which includes a snug chamber called \\"Mr Sampson's apartment,\\" and a separate bungalow for Colonel Mannering. Harry's late aunt's estate has also reverted to him, but he resigns it to his sister on her marriage to Hazelwood.

Places and importance of various characters The title character, Guy Mannering, is a relatively minor character in the story, a friend of the family who uses his knowledge of astrology to predict Henry's future on the day of his birth. The old gypsy woman Meg Merrilies, is evicted from the Bertram lands early in the novel. In spite of this she remains loyal to the Bertram family, and much of the plot is dependent on her actions. She was based on an 18th-century gypsy named Jean Gordon. A Dandie Dinmont Terrier; the breed's name derives from one of the characters in Guy Mannering who keeps such dogs Dandie Dinmont is a rough but friendly farmer from the Liddesdale hills, who owns a number of terriers—the Dandie Dinmont Terrier is named after him. An upland sheep-raiser of Scott's acquaintance named Willie Elliot, of Millburnholm, was probably the model for this character. Dominie Sampson, according to Nuttall, was \\"a poor, modest, humble scholar, who had won his way through the classics, but fallen to the leeward in the voyage of life\\". \\"Dominie\\" is the Lowland Scots term for a school master. Tib Mumps was the disreputable landlady of the inn where an important meeting takes place between Meg Merrilies and Bertram. The inn was later revealed by Scott to be based upon Mumps Hall in Gilsland. Reception Although Guy Mannering sold briskly the critical reception was mixed. Most of the reviews were broadly favourable, but they generally had more or less substantial reservations.For a full list of contemporaneous British reviews see William S. Ward, Literary Reviews in British Periodicals, 1798‒1820: A Bibliography, 2 vols (New York and London, 1972), 2.485. For an earlier annotated list see James Clarkson Corson, A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh and London, 1943), 201–02. Positive features mentioned by several reviewers included the energetic and virtuoso writing, the vivid descriptions, the acute knowledge of human nature, and the near-sublime Meg Merrilies with the contrasting Dandie Dinmont. John Wilson Croker in The Quarterly Review was alone in thinking that Meg was given undue importance. There were objections to the inappropriate introduction of astrology, the weak plot, the insipid young ladies and the exaggerated Dominie Sampson (though he was generally appreciated), and the unintelligible Scots speeches. Adaptations Sarah Egerton as Meg Merrilies in Guy Mannering (1817) Daniel Terry, an English playwright and friend of Scott, wrote an adaptation of the work for the stage for which Henry Bishop provided the music.

She was Playboy's Playmate of the Month for March 1987.  Early life  Born in Windsor, Berkshire, and originally from Taplow, Buckinghamshire, she and her older brother Martin \\"moved around a lot\\" until they reached Norfolk. She had an unconventional, hippie, nomadic upbringing in the rural environs of Norfolk, as well as different parts of the Midlands and the Southeast. By her own account, her family \\"thought we were getting a new- built home, but it wasn't ready, and my mother, being as practical as ever, said: 'Well, we are homeless, so we are travellers until we are housed'. I remember trees, bushes and grass and a toilet in a shed. There was this enormous chrome caravan with those sort of lacy doily things in the window, and my birthday party in a tent, playing pass the parcel in the pouring rain. Rain is still my favourite weather\\". As a girl, her dreams were to become a dancer and prime minister, because she \\"liked the idea of being in charge\\". Baker travelled widely as a teenager spending three years visiting France, Corsica, Italy, Greece and Switzerland, before ending up on Cape Clear, an island off the southern tip of Ireland, \\"because there was a ferry leaving to go there\\". She trained as a dancer at Bush Davies ballet school and left with six O-levels, but later abandoned A-levels in Drama, English and History at Norwich City Tech for London. Her initial career ambition was politics, inspired by her mother's environmental activism as well as her relationship with PR boss Matthew Freud, son of the ex-Liberal MP Clement Freud, whom she met while working as a waitress in London. She said: \\"I got into it when I was 18. My boyfriend’s father was Clement Freud, and I used to help out. I loved it. Nicholas Parsons would be there stuffing envelopes, and I'd be out chatting to people....Lewes District Council: Chair of the Council 2007–2008 It really suited me knocking on doors going \\"Hello! How are you? How are things for you? Is your MP helpful? What could be better round here? Oh, I see what you mean ... Terrible state of the roads\\". To supplement her modest income, Baker began glamour modeling as a Page 3 girl at age 17 before she was discovered by noted erotic photographer Byron Newman. When asked about what influenced her decision, she answered, \\"I really didn't have any problems about my body. It wasn't ever an ambition. It was just one of those things—if you are a certain height with a certain look and a certain pneumatic silhouette—sooner or later in that sort of company it's a bit inevitable really\\". She claimed that her comfort with posing nude was due to the liberating influence of her mother, Margaret Ayrton, a Witch. She said \\"I suppose being brought up by hippies as parents, I had absolutely no problem being naked. The problems I had were actually wrestling with the whole sort of feminist thing. I tried to justify it to myself that there were loads of jobs that I thought were equally demeaning because they had such a low wage. When I waitressed, my take home pay was what I could earn in two hours modelling\\". She attributes her buxom figure to a combination of rigorous ballet-training and having Irish and Welsh ancestry.Quoted in Playboy Playmate Six-Pack interview, 1992.  Playboy Playmate  Baker was first approached to pose for Penthouse but turned them down and did her Playmate shoot in 1986 when she was 18. When the March 1987 issue of Playboy was released to newsstands she had only recently turned 19. In 1995 Baker wrote a lengthy article about her experiences as a Playmate for the London edition of Time Out magazine.  Acting, journalism and writing career  Baker has appeared in two films: the 1987 TV movie Casanova, starring Richard Chamberlain, and the 1990 short film Man from China. She also acted in the musical Forever Elvis (in the role of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley), and played Nina in a stage production of Chekov's The Seagull. By this time, she got involved in fighting chemical factories, ran a campsite with a cafe, worked on a goat farm, looked after a child and ran a community theatre. Following the death of a boyfriend she retired from acting and modeling while still in her early twenties and for a brief time went back to waitressing in England. Back home, she decided to further her education and completed a BA (Hons) in journalism from the London College of Printing and an MA in dramatic writing from the University of Sussex. She ended up doing work experience at the News of the World, before joining the London Evening Standard. During the 1990s, Baker worked extensively as a journalist, most often for The Independent, The Telegraph and The Guardian newspapers, as well as Punch (where she was the Punch milkmaid), and Junior Magazine in the United Kingdom. She is known today as a practising Wiccan and author of several children's books on Witchcraft, including Spells for the Witch in You; Spells for Teenage Witches: Get Your Way with Magical Power; Marina Baker's Teenage Survival Guide; and Spells for Cats (the last was published under the name Daisy Pepper). In 2001, she worked as a magic consultant for a BBC documentary about the Harry Potter books.  Political career  Baker is active in local politics in the Lewes area of England, now working under her married name of Marina Pepper. In 2006, she chaired the Lewes district council, where she represented the coastal communities of East Saltdean and Telscombe Cliffs, just five miles east of the cosmopolitan hub of Brighton in Sussex. She lost her seat on 3 May 2007 when she was defeated for re-election by the Conservatives. She has also served as the mayoress of Telscombe and during the 2005 General Election she stood (unsuccessfully) for Parliament in the Brighton Kemptown constituency as a Liberal Democrat. She has been quoted as saying, somewhat facetiously, \\"I'm not sure Page Three girls can become MPs\\". Baker is active in a number of local environmentalist programs such as the Saltdean \\"walking bus\\", which accompanies a line of children to school, reducing the number of cars on the road and giving the children \\"a good bit of exercise\\" before school. She has also set up a community recycling scheme for a local preschool and ran eco-fairs to help promote understanding of sustainable living. As a member of the Telscombe town council, she takes an active role in REGEN—part of the Local Strategic Partnership—where she organises projects to promote social economic and environmental well-being in the towns of Peacehaven, Telscombe and East Saltdean. She organises regular REGEN events in the community, including \\"The Circle\\", a sustainability fair which has run in conjunction with Telscombe's Town fair, RANDOMfreeFEST—a youth festival in Peacehaven—and \\"Cool Yule\\", a seasonal market held at the beginning of the Christmas shopping season, promoting local food and gifts. Marina also appeared in the 2011 documentary \\"Just Do It\\" on environmental activism. In July 2013 she was arrested by police for obstruction when she joined a protest against fracking in Balcombe in West Sussex.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1990 to 2003 for the Texas Rangers, Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox and Detroit Tigers. He also served as the bullpen coach and first base coach for the Boston Red Sox. Haselman was a 1st round selection in the 1987 Major League Baseball draft. Early life Haselman was born in Long Branch, New Jersey and graduated from Saratoga High School in Saratoga, California. He attended UCLA where he played for the UCLA Bruins baseball team as an understudy to Todd Zeile. He also played for the UCLA Bruins football team as a substitute quarterback behind starting quarterback Troy Aikman. Professional baseball careerTexas Rangers= He was drafted as the 23rd pick of the 1st round of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft by the Texas Rangers. He began his professional career that year for the Gastonia Rangers of the South Atlantic League. In 1988, he was promoted to the Port Charlotte Rangers of the High-A Florida State League, where he hit .245 in 122 games. Haselman spent 1989 and 1990 with the AA Tulsa Drillers of the Texas League. He was a September call-up with the Rangers in 1990 and made his Major League debut at the age of 24 as a pinch hitter on September 3, 1990, against the Cleveland Indians. He recorded his first hit, also as a pinch hitter, off Joe Klink of the Oakland Athletics on September 27. In 14 games, he had two hits in 13 at-bats. He returned to the minors and spent 1991 and the first part of 1992 with the Oklahoma City 89ers of the AAA American Association. =Seattle Mariners= On May 29, 1992, he was selected off waivers by the Seattle Mariners, who assigned him to the Calgary Cannons of the Pacific Coast League, where he hit .255 in 88 games with 19 home runs and 53 RBI. He also got into 8 games for the Mariners in September and had five hits in 19 at- bats. He spent most of 1993 as the Mariners back-up catcher and hit his first home run on May 8 off of Jim Deshaies of the Minnesota Twins. On June 6, 1993, Haselman was hit by a pitch thrown by Baltimore Orioles pitcher Mike Mussina, leading to him charging the mound and igniting a bench-clearing brawl. In parts of three seasons with Seattle, he appeared in 104 games and hit .234 with 6 home runs and 24 RBI. =Boston Red Sox= He signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox on November 7, 1994 and played with the Red Sox through the 1997 season as a backup catcher.

With the bases empty and the score tied 5-5, he pinch hit for catcher Mike Macfarlane in the bottom of the 11th inning. Haselman shattered his bat, sending a Woody Williams' offering sailing over the Green Monster to give the Red Sox their first walk-off win of their 1995 Eastern Division winning campaign. Haselman had his best season in 1996, when he hit .274 with 8 HR and 34 RBI in a career-high 237 At bats for the Red Sox. He also led American League catchers with a 7.64 range factor. Haselman was the battery-mate for Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens on September 18, 1996 when Clemens struck out 20 batters in a game against the Detroit Tigers to tie his own major league single-game strikeout record in a 9 inning game. =Texas Rangers/Detroit Tigers= The Red Sox traded him on November 6, 1997 (along with Mark Brandenburg and Aaron Sele) to the Texas Rangers for Damon Buford and Jim Leyritz.

He remained with Texas through 2002. Overall, in parts of five seasons with the Rangers he played in 225 games and hit .273. He rejoined the Tigers again on a free agent contract on January 20, 2003 but was released on March 27, before the season started. =Boston Red Sox/Baltimore Orioles= He was signed as a free agent by the Red Sox on April 11, 2003 and was hitless in three at-bats in 4 games for them that season. He played in his final major league game on September 27, 2003. He also played in 79 games with the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox. He signed as a minor league free agent with the Baltimore Orioles on December 3, 2003, but retired before playing in any games at the age of 37. Career statistics In a thirteen- year major league career, Haselman played in 589 games, accumulating 416 hits in 1,606 at-bats for a .259 career batting average along with 47 home runs, 210 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .311. He had a .991 career fielding percentage as a catcher. Coaching career Haselman served as the Red Sox' interim first-base coach in 2004, bullpen coach in 2005 and full-time first-base coach in 2006. Boston then offered him a position managing in the minor leagues, and while he said he was tempted, he did not want to spend that much time away from his family. Haselman then went into private business and worked as a post game host during Seattle Mariners' games. In 2010, he returned to baseball as the manager of the Class A Bakersfield Blaze, a California League affiliate of the Texas Rangers. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim named him as the manager of the club's Inland Empire 66ers minor league team on Jan. 9, 2012. In 2013, Haselman guided Inland Empire to a California League title. Haselman then joined the Los Angeles Dodgers organization in 2014 as the manager for the Great Lakes Loons of the Midwest League. In 2015, the Dodgers assigned Haselman to be the manager of the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the California League. He led them to the team's first California League championship since 1994 and tied for the California League South Division's best regular-season record with a 78-62 won-loss record. In 2016 he became the manager of the Oklahoma City Dodgers in the AAA Pacific Coast League. He also served as a volunteer assistant coach for the Washington Huskies baseball team.

H. Russell (6 November 1938 - 28 July 2020)Diana Russell was a feminist writer and activist. Born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, she moved to England in 1957, and then to the United States in 1961. For the past 45 years she was engaged in research on sexual violence against women and girls. She wrote numerous books and articles on rape, including marital rape, femicide, incest, misogynist murders of women, and pornography. For The Secret Trauma, she was co-recipient of the 1986 C. Wright Mills Award. She was also the recipient of the 2001 Humanist Heroine Award from the American Humanist Association. She was also an organizer of the First International Tribunal on Crimes against Women, in Brussels in March 1976.Russell, Diana E. H. Dangerous Relationships: Pornography, Misogyny, and Rape, Sage Publications, 1998, , p 205 Early life Russell was born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, a twin and the fourth of the six children of a South African father, James Hamilton Russell, and a British mother, Kathleen Mary (née Gibson) Russell. She attended an Anglican boarding school for girls. After completing her Bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Cape Town, at the age of 19, Russell left for Britain. In Britain, she enrolled in a Post-Graduate Diploma in Social Science and Administration at the London School of Economics and Political Science. In 1961, she passed the Diploma with Distinction and also received the prize for the best student in the program. She moved to the United States, in 1963 where she had been accepted into an interdisciplinary PhD program at Harvard University. Her research focused on sociology and the study of revolution. Russell's radical activism began with her involvement in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. In 1963, Russell had joined the Liberal Party of South Africa that had been founded by Alan Paton, the author of Cry the Beloved Country. While participating in a peaceful protest in Cape Town, Russell was arrested with other party members. She came to the conclusion that non-violent strategies were futile against the brutal violence and repression of the white Afrikaner police state. Thereafter, she joined the African Resistance Movement (ARM), an underground revolutionary movement fighting apartheid in South Africa. The principal strategy of the ARM was to bomb and sabotage government property, and though Russell was only a peripheral member of the ARM, she still risked a 10-year incarceration if caught. Russell's analysis of strategies and tactics for social and political change is detailed in her book, Rebellion, Revolution, and Armed Force: A Comparative Study of Fifteen Countries with Special Emphasis on Cuba and South Africa (1974). Research and writings on rape and sexual abuse Rape and other forms of men's sexual exploitation and abuse of women was one of the primary focuses of Russell's research and writings. In her book, The Politics of Rape (1975), Russell suggested that rape was a display of socially defined perceptions of masculinity instead of deviant social behavior. Her other books in this area are Rape in Marriage (1982), Sexual Exploitation: Rape, Child Sexual Abuse, and Workplace Harassment (1984). In 1986, Russell published The Secret Trauma: Incest in the Lives of Girls and Women (1986). It was one of the first scientific research studies of incestuous sexual abuse to be published. For it she received the C.Wright Mills Award in 1986. In 1993, she edited an anthology on pornography, Making Violence Sexy: Feminist Views on Pornography. Her 1994 book, Against Pornography: The Evidence of Harm, which includes 100 pornographic photos, was a study establishing how pornography encourages men to rape and leads to increased incidents of rape. Organizing the First International Tribunal on Crimes Against Women Russell lobbied other feminists for two years and eventually was successful in organizing the first International Tribunal on Crimes against Women in Brussels, Belgium, in 1976. The conference which lasted for four days, in which individual women from different countries testified to their personal experiences of various forms of violence and oppressions because of their gender, was attended by 2,000 women from 40 countries. By the second day it had dissolved into disaster, as \\"radical activists were storming the stage one after another in an improvised free-for-fall\\".On \\"Femicide\\", newrepublic.com; accessed 1 June 2015. Simone de Beauvoir in her introductory speech to the Tribunal said: \\"I salute the International Tribunal as the beginning of the radical decolonization of women.\\" Later, Belgian feminist Nicole Van de Ven documented the event in a book, Crimes Against Women: The Proceedings of the International Tribunal (1976). Redefining and politicizing \\"femicide\\" In 1976 Russell redefined ‘Femicide’, as \\"the killing of females by males because they are female.\\" At the International Tribunal on Crimes Against Women, she testified to numerous examples of lethal forms of male violence against women and girls from different cultures around the world. Russell's intention was to politicize the term, and bring attention to the misogyny driving these lethal crimes against women, which she said gender-neutral terms like murder don’t do. Russell who was puzzled about the lack of response of women's groups in the United States to the use of the term 'Femicide' continued to advocate the use of 'Femicide' to women's groups in the United States and around the world. She explained that in order to deal with these extreme crimes against women, it is necessary to recognize that like race based hate crimes, \\"Femicides are [also] lethal hate crimes\\", and that most killings of women by men are \\"extreme manifestations of male dominance and sexism.\\" In 1993, Russell initiated an organization called Women United Against Incest, which supports incest survivors with legal assistance against their perpetrators. Similarly, she created the first TV program in South Africa where incest survivors talk in person about their experiences. Feminist movements in many countries in Latin America, as in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Chile, and El Salvador among others, have adopted the use of Russell's politicized 'Femicide' and have successfully used it socially, politically and legally to address lethal violence against women in their respective countries. In 1992, she co-edited an anthology, Femicide: The Politics of Woman Killing. Other In 1977, Russell became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

The former was inspired by Koppett's conversations with contemporary athletes who had little or no knowledge about the history of their game and the great players of decades past, while the latter memorably began with a one-word paragraph -- \\"Fear.\\" -- and then explored how the batter's instinctive fear of the thrown pitch is the key point around which most other aspects of baseball play are derived. The Essence of the Game is Deception: Thinking about Basketball took a similar approach to basketball.

Abandoning further graduate work, she joined the staff of the National Peace Action Coalition, later becoming a National Coordinator; they focused on building peaceful, legal demonstrations against the Vietnam War. Before returning to full-time teaching in 1975, Coontz also had a leadership role in the Young Socialist Alliance, a Trotskyist youth group of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). By the late 1970s, however, Coontz had parted company with the SWP. Academic career In addition to her current teaching position at Evergreen, Coontz has also taught at Kobe University in Japan and the University of Hawaii at Hilo. She won the Washington Governor's Writers Award in 1989 for her book The Social Origins of Private Life: A History of American Families. In 1995 she received the Dale Richmond Award from the American Academy of Pediatrics for her \\"outstanding contributions to the field of child development.\\" She received the 2001-02 \\"Friend of the Family\\" award from the Illinois Council on Family Relations. In 2004, she received the first-ever \\"Visionary Leadership\\" Award from the Council on Contemporary Families. Coontz studies the history of American families, marriage, and changes in gender roles. Her book The Way We Never Were argues against several common myths about families of the past, including the idea that the 1950s family was traditional or the notion that families used to rely solely on their own resources. Her book, Marriage, A History: How Love Conquered Marriage, traces the history of marriage from Anthony and Cleopatra (not a love story, she argues) to debates over same-sex marriage. Her newest book, about the wives and daughters of \\"The Greatest Generation,\\" is A Strange Stirring: The Feminine Mystique and American Women at the Dawn of the 1960s. Coontz has appeared on national television and radio programs, including Oprah, the Today Show, The Colbert Report and dozens of NPR shows. In addition, her work has been featured in newspapers and magazines, as well as in many academic and professional journals. She has testified about her research before the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families and addressed audiences across America, Europe, and Japan. In the landmark United States Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy cited Coontz's book, Marriage, A History in their decision to grant marriage equality to same-sex couples.A New Right Grounded in the Long History of Marriage Books *Coontz, Stephanie.

It was recorded during his 1978 world tour and is composed mostly of the artist's \\"greatest hits\\". The performances in the album are radically altered from the originals, using the same musicians that backed Street-Legal, but relying on a much larger band and stronger use of brass and backing singers. In some respects the arrangements are more conventional than the original arrangements, for which the album was criticized. For a few critics, such as Janet Maslin of Rolling Stone, the differences between the older and newer arrangements had become less important.Sounes, 2001, Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan, pp. 314–316. Recording and releases The audio recording is from shows on February 28 and March 1, 1978. Columbia Records released this double LP in Japan on August 21, 1978. Later that year, it was released in Australia and New Zealand. On April 23, 1979, spurred by extensive importing and at least one counterfeit European edition, Columbia released the album to worldwide markets. The shows were the fourth and fifth in an eight-show appearance at Nippon Budokan Hall in Tokyo, Japan. Reception Bob Dylan at Budokan received some of the worst reviews of Dylan's career. Critically savaged, it was derided as \\"slick\\" and \\"sterile.\\" In a sarcastic review published in his \\"Consumer Guide\\" column, Robert Christgau gave the album a C+ rating, writing \\"I believe this double LP was made available so our hero could boast of being outclassed by Cheap Trick, who had the self-control to release but a single disc from this location.\\" Critic Jimmy Guterman named it one of the worst albums ever released in the history of rock. However, the album received stronger reviews in Europe, and critic Janet Maslin (then a music critic for Rolling Stone magazine) defended the album in her review. \\"The method here is hit-or-miss, and the results are correspondingly spotty,\\" Maslin wrote. \\"The fire and brimstone are behind Dylan, [but] this hardly means the fight has gone out of him: Bob Dylan at Budokan is a very contentious effort—and, for the most part, a victorious one.\\" Fire and brimstone were to again become very much a part of Dylan's music, with the release of his album Slow Train Coming later in 1979. Bob Dylan at Budokan reached in the U.S. and went platinum, while simultaneously peaking at in the UK.

Based along Maxwell and Halsted Streets, the gang often stole from local businesses while posing as push cart vendors. The gang developed a method of robbery known as the \\"kick in\\" where Merry and six members would pull up to a local store and, with one man staying with the wagon and two lookouts outside, Merry and the other members would kick in the entrance and haul off the stores merchandise onto the wagon.

Sjöfn is attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in three kennings employed in skaldic poetry. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.  Attestations  In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur. High lists Sjöfn seventh, and says that Sjöfn is \\"concerned to direct people's minds to love, both women and men.\\" In addition, High states that from Sjöfn's name comes the Old Norse word sjafni.Faulkes (1995:30). In the Nafnaþulur section appended to the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál, chapter 75, Sjöfn is included in a list of 27 names of ásynjur.Faulkes (1995:157). Otherwise, the name Sjöfn is thrice employed as a base word in skaldic kennings for \\"woman\\".Lindow (2001:268).  Theories  Regarding the information given about Sjöfn in Gylfaginning, John Lindow says that the word sjafni does indeed appear listed in the þulur as a word for \\"love\\", yet that outside this description no information about the goddess is known. Lindow states that some scholars theorize that Sjöfn may be the goddess Frigg under another name. Rudolf Simek says that Snorri may have derived his etymology of Sjöfn from the Old Norse words sefi (\\"sense\\") or from sefi (possibly \\"relation\\"), but that the scant references to Sjöfn do not allow for much more of an elaborate explanation for the goddess. Simek says that, accordingly, Sjöfn is viewed as a goddess of \\"marriage and love, or else one of relationships\\" and that Sjöfn is among several goddesses mentioned in the Prose Edda \\"who are matron-like guardian-goddesses.\\"Simek (2007:286).

Michael Straczynski about 113 people (called \\"Specials\\") born with special abilities following the appearance of a mysterious light in the sky above Pederson, Illinois. The series explores how society may react to the advent of superpowers, and how those who are Specials may react towards society and each other. Rising Stars was one of the first comics produced under Straczynski's own Joe's Comics imprint for Top Cow Productions. Publication history The comic was published in August 1999, monthly at first by Top Cow/Image Comics, and then under the Joe's Comics imprint. Within a few months, however, there were unscheduled artist changes and unexplained delays by Top Cow in shipping the comics—sometimes lasting months. The comic itself came to an unexpected halt after issue 21 due to internal arguments between Straczynski and Top Cow. Straczynski claimed he was cut out of the loop on the potential Rising Stars movie. After communication broke down between them, he held back the scripts for the last three issues, and the entire comic was put on hold. In addition to an apology for the way Straczynski was treated in regard to the possible film, Top Cow relented by giving him the full rights to an anthology comic he had written for them, Dream Police (later published by Marvel Comics), as well as the rights to the name and logo for the Joe's Comics imprint. The last issue of Rising Stars was published in March 2005. During the intervening time, Straczynski had gone on to write a revamp of Marvel's Squadron Supreme, Supreme Power. Story The story is narrated from the future by the last living Special, John Simon, nicknamed \\"Poet\\". The genesis of the Specials is shown to be the unforgettable descent of a fierce comet from the heavens. The story starts when the Specials are all grown up, but it constantly flashes back to when they were children. Through these flashbacks, the development of these 113 Specials is shown, starting with the government's monitoring and handling of the events, to the manifestation of their powers, to the impact of these abilities on the afflicted children and the world around them. Some of the Specials use their powers for the good of the world, others for personal benefit and fame, while others simply wish to forget about them and live a normal life. A series of murders of the Specials spurs John to investigate. He learns that when a Special dies, their \\"energy\\" transfers to the remaining Specials, making each more powerful. This fact had become known to a Special with multiple personality disorder, who calls herself Critical Maas. It emerges that Maas has been manipulating \\"Patriot\\" (the alter ego of Jason Miller) to kill other Specials so her own power would be increased. At the instigation of Maas, the U.S. government also attacks the Specials, killing more. With her newly increased powers, Maas and a handful of Specials under her telepathic control are able to conquer Chicago, claiming it for themselves.Rising Stars Vol. 1: Born in Fire (Issue #1–8) Ten years pass and John, his half-brother Randy Fisk (alter ego: Ravenshadow), Elizabeth Chandra, and Joshua Kane (alter ego: Sanctuary) lead the rest of the Specials in an attempt to liberate Chicago after the U.S. government promises that all charges against them will be dropped. Maas is defeated, but at a price: Matthew Bright, who had been sent by the government to assist in her defeat, is beaten into a coma by Patriot, while the latter was still under Maas' control. Seeing that internecine conflict was not what they were empowered for, John proclaims that he wants them all to act as a unit so they can help humanity. The violence in Chicago affected the rest of the Specials as well and they all agree to assist John in his mission.Rising Stars Vol. 2: Power (Issue #9–16) Another ten years pass, and their mission is almost complete. Humanity has been helped by the Specials, and more importantly, has been given the confidence and resources to further help themselves. But after Randy Fisk wins the Presidency, elements in the U.S. government, seeing the Specials as a threat to their power, plot to assassinate the remaining few. A bomb, specifically designed to destroy even the most powerful Special, is set off during a gathering of almost all the Specials, excepting John who is busy working on a secret project. All present are killed, including Randy and John's lover, Elizabeth Chandra. The released power is initially distributed amongst all the people of the world, instantly curing all forms of illness and injury. It also grants everyone limited telepathy, bringing an end to all wars, violence, and strife as people become aware of the thoughts and feelings of those they had previously viewed as their enemies. Those involved in the mass assassination voluntarily come forward and confess. For 24 hours, not a single human being dies. After that blessed 24 hours, the power soars into the sky and seeks out John, giving him all its power and knocking him out for seven days. He uses that power to provide energy for the project he had been working on: a space ship that travels near the speed of light. The immense power within John directs the ship to yet another world, an alien planet much like Earth. John's ship erupts into a fireball, strikingly similar to the one that had empowered the Specials, as it comes crashing down onto the planet's surface. It can be assumed that a process similar to what happened with the Specials would happen to this planet's populace. The circle has been completed.Rising Stars Vol. 3: Fire and Ash (Issue #17–24). The meaning is where all life is special and though we lost all our heroes in a sad circumstance there has been good in that struggle. Maybe a new world cycle will be different and learn the same lessons as well. CharactersSpecials= There are 113 Specials, with the story focusing on a select few and often featuring appearances by others. #John Simon (Poet) – Poet and writer, but not a very popular one. As a child he maintained a distance from many of the other Specials, his closest friend being Dr. Welles. It is commonly known that he has a knack with electronics; he can avoid security systems, and is sensitive to electrical impulses. Secretly, however, he is the most \\"lethal\\" of all the Specials – whereas the other 112 Specials have powers fueled by the energy of the Flash, Poet can control that energy directly. Though not the fastest or strongest, he is the deadliest, with Dr. Welles predicting that he has the potential to defeat any of the other Specials in one-on-one combat. This leads to the theory that John is a fail-safe of the 113, the best candidate to eliminate threats should any of the Specials go rogue. John is the first to suspect that someone is murdering Specials, and takes it upon himself to solve the mystery as well as record the story of the Specials. He allies himself with Randy Fisk, who is later revealed to be his half-brother, and eventually forms a romantic relationship with Chandra. During the events at Chicago, he temporarily dies before being brought back by Cathy Holmes. #Matthew Bright – A police officer with the powers of flight, super-strength and speed, near-invulnerability, making him among the strongest of the Specials. At first he hid his identity as a Special so as to join the police. After a series of serial bombings, he is exposed and the Federal Government revokes his badge as Specials are not allowed to participate in any form of government department. His fellow officers then name him a 'special' deputy rank and supply a new badge and uniform. Being the only one of the Specials with legal power and authority, he is often used by the government as a means of controlling or observing conflict relating to other Specials. After the events in Chicago, he is comatose. #Jason Miller (Formerly Flagg, Patriot) – Masked corporate superhero employed by NexusCorp, later turned vigilante – With the powers of super-strength, flight, near-invulnerability and the power to sense radiation, he was initially considered the strongest among the Specials. Was seduced by Stephanie Maas and taken over by her split personality Critical Mass. Jason was used to murder other specials so that their power would transfer to the rest and eventually would have allowed Critical the ability to control them all. After being freed of Critical's control, Jason resolves to use his powers for the greater good – stealing nuclear weapon and burying deep within the arctic, ushering in a celebrated nuclear disarmament. However, a punctured nuclear missile gives him radiation poisoning, which causes the deaths of his family and his own disfigurement. He later dies, protecting (and unwittingly waking up) a comatose Matthew Bright. #Elizabeth Chandra – Former model – Appears as the physically ideal woman to whoever is looking at her, she lives in a mansion with a large amount of wealthy benefactors who she requires all to wear masks. Later gains the ability to inspire love rather than lust in both male and female onlookers, and holds fund raisers in order to help the Specials' cause. She is in love with John Simon, who is the only one of the male Specials to never ask her out, and the only one who sees her as she really is. They later become a couple. Post-surge, she develops super strength, and much later, the power of flight. #Randy Fisk (Ravenshadow) – Artist – Flight, super-strength, ability to see things nobody else can, agility, is sensitive to electrical impulses, energy projection. He is the first of the Specials to don a mask and attempt vigilante, and is at first the most organised and prepared of the Specials, funding his crime-fighting by creating and selling his art. He is revealed to be John Simon's half-brother. Later, he dedicates himself to ridding the streets of criminal activity, inspiring people to stand up for themselves. He later runs for president – failing several times before finally becoming elected and ushering in an age of peace and prosperity in the United States. #Stephanie Maas/Critical Mass – Stephanie was one of the children in utero during the time of the Flash, although she initially is believed to not have any powers. Later it is revealed that she has the powers of flight, super- strength, mind-control and telepathy, although these powers are only accessible by Critical Mass, the second identity that she developed as a child to cope with the abuse of her father. Critical eventually becomes the dominant personality as she gains control of Jason Miller and other Specials, forcing them to kill other Specials thereby making Critical stronger. At the end of the events at Chicago, Stephanie regains brief control and throws herself into a fire to put an end to Critical's killing spree. #Jerry Montrose (Pyre) – Pyrokinetic – Controls fire, capable of surrounding his body in intense heat without burning and the ability to fly as well as enhanced strength. Pyre is considered a rogue, the supervillain to Jason Miller's superhero, with whom he has a very public rivalry. However it is shown that they are in fact, good friends along with Joshua Kane, albeit sharing a tense relationship at times. Later he dedicates his time to burning the cocaine fields in Columbia, and being paid for his presence by casinos in Las Vegas. He is later tricked, shot down and murdered by the US government during their trials to test whether or not an EMP blast could temporarily de-power a Special. #Paula Ramirez – Singer – She has a singing voice that cannot be recorded and transmitted via any man- made device, and any who hear it cannot remember what they have heard, only that it was incredibly beautiful. She later becomes a famous performer and concert darling. #William Smith – Flight, super-strength and speed, can locate the rest of Specials, limited telepathy. Called 'Willie' as a child, he could only hover a few feet as he was the victim of teasing over his weight and this directly affected his confidence and in turn his abilities. During a particularly rough day Willie \\"snapped\\" as it is put and proceeded to float off and leaves not to be seen again until he saves Cathy Holmes in Chicago from Critical Maas. He views John Simon as the only one of the Specials he has any obligation to help, as John was the only one who stood by him when he was being bullied. #Joshua Kane (Sanctuary) – Televangelist – Levitation, energy absorption, ability to generate and concentrate light. The son of a preacher who capitalises on Joshua's very holy looking abilities by calling it a blessing from God and building a church around him. Although he wishes to obey his father, Joshua feels oppressed and lonely due to the fact that he is a transvestite and must hide who he is. His childhood friends Jerry Montrose and Jason Miller are the only ones aware of this. During the events at Chicago, after being protected by Chandra he disappears into a clothing store. Later he protects Chandra from Critical's hybrid beasts and absorbs the explosion from a nuke intended to destroy a group of Specials, saving everyone – although he performs these tasks after having changed into women's clothing and directly after his death, many of the Specials have no idea who it was that saved them. #Laurel Darkhaven – Telekinetic Government assassin. Laurel is a telekinetic, described as the only one of the Specials that can scare even John Simon. Laurel is able to move small objects – the smaller the object the finer her control. It is thought to be a useless ability at first, but given the fact that she can target small arteries and kill untraceably with this power, she is immediately employed by a government agency upon her graduation. After realising that none of her work has helped facilitate peace in the Middle- East, she plans to destroy several sacred landmarks in order to unite them in fear of her. However, convinced of an alternative path by John Simon, Laurel expends her life force to bring fertile soil, grain by grain, to the surface of the land and cover the desert, hoping that the fertile earth will provide for all and eliminate the need to wage war of land. #Lionel Zerb – Medium – Detached and distant, the other children in the encampment believe him to be a snob before it is revealed that he is constantly listening to the voices of the recently deceased. Later on, he develops the ability to listen to even those long deceased. To get some peace and quiet, he moves far up into the mountains unpopulated by humans where he will no longer have to deal with the voices of the dead. #Cathy Holmes – Healer – grows up believing herself to be one of the children in utero during the Flash that was not given any powers. However it is revealed that she has healing powers, and is able to revive the recently deceased. Critical Mass captures her and forces her to bring to life Frankenstein-like monsters, made up of stitched together parts of different animals. She is released by William Smith, but is shot by one of Critical's lackeys. Her last act before dying is to bring back the defeated John Simon. #Brody Kempler – Supergenius – Described as being smarter than all of the world's most renowned genii put together. Although out of contact with the other Specials for a long time, John Simon eventually reaches out to him. Brody supplies the Specials with cover identities and develops several fail- safe technologies should anything happen to any of the Specials. He also becomes Randy Fisk's scientific consultant upon his presidential election. #Clarence Mack – Psychologist – Telepathically visits other people's dreams. While visiting Jason Miller's dreams, he discovers that he is the murderer who has been killing other Specials. He is killed by Jason for this, but is able to contact John Simon via Lionel Zerb, revealing to him what he knows. He also reveals to John that Chandra has always been in love with him, to John's surprise. # Peter Dawson – Invulnerable – a microthin energy shield protects his body from all injury, and filters his environment. As result, he has no physical sensation, except for taste – leading to excessive overeating and obesity. Cannot be physically injured, or poisoned in any way. Peter was murdered by Patriot while under Critical Mass' control. Patriot placed a plastic bag over his head and tied him down, the shield covering Peters' body meant he could not feel this happening and suffocated. #Lee Jackson – Pyrokinetic – Abilities similar to Jerry Montrose (Pyre). Abused as a child by a camp counselor, Lee later burned him alive using his powers after the counselor attempted to abuse him again. This became the first instance of a Special using his power for harm, leading the U.S. government to review their policies. Lee is also believed to have accidentally killed his parents by burning down their apartment while having a nightmare. Lived on the streets and was eventually taken in by an old woman, who was later killed by a gang of thugs. This led to a highly publicized rampage from Lee, who committed suicide in a violent explosion after killing the gang responsible. #David Mueller – Able to merge his mind with people within 20 feet. Lost his consciousness when his mother committed suicide while he was in her mind trying to stop her, his comatose body was killed when Jason Miller threw it out a hospital window. #Patrick Ferry – The ability to disappear into shadows and go anywhere without being noticed. At first, the Specials possessed varying levels of power, ranging from the clearly superhuman, such as Matthew Bright and Jason Miller, to almost negligible abilities like being invisible when not in direct sunlight. However, when a Special died, the energy they possessed was evenly distributed among the rest, making them stronger. In an incident similar to the Waco Siege, a number of Specials were killed. The resultant transfer of energy, later known as the Surge, was enough to turn all specials regardless of their standing into high powered individuals. =Others= #Dr. William Welles – The Supreme Court assigned Dr. Welles to the Specials shortly after their powers manifested in order to document their abilities and teach them to cope with their new powers. Further, he was to compile files on each to be used by government should any of the Specials ever go rogue. He has a close personal friendship with John Simon (Poet), whose main power he never reveals. Dr. Welles dies halfway through the story, leaving John Simon to solve the Specials crisis. #Jacob Polachek – although Dr. Welles declared him not a Special, he insisted he had powers that nobody knew about. Nobody believed him, and when he attempted to stop a truck soon after, he was killed. In Rising Stars #½, this character is elaborated upon, although his name is Edward Claiborn. Edward is committed into the Specials' encampment for observation after claiming to have powers, but is released when it is revealed he has been making it up. He dies pushing his friend out of the path of an oncoming truck. This may actually (likely) be two different people.

It is planned to extend from north west Virginia to central West Virginia. The route is planned as a four-lane divided highway and has been constructed in segments, most of which are open. The westernmost portion from Weston to Lorentz was constructed in the 1970s; the extension east to Elkins was constructed in the early 1990s, and the segment between Davis and Wardensville was constructed in segments which opened during 2002–2016. As of 2020, two segments are not yet upgraded and remain having the U.S. 48 designation: Kerens–Davis and Wardensville–Strasburg. West Virginia's segment of Corridor H crosses very mountainous terrain, some of the most rugged in the eastern United States and crosses two major rivers. There are more than 1000 historic structures, five historic districts, two Civil War battlefields and other archaeological sites within five miles (8 km) of Corridor H, and the highway crosses through two national forests. There are over 50 species of plants and animals that are protected under the Endangered Species Act and more than 150 native trout streams, thousands of acres of wetlands and high mountain bogs, areas of karst terrain, and abandoned coal mines within the Corridor H study area. Two previous highways were designated as US 48\\\\. The first, in California, was incorporated into the route of US 50; the second, in western Maryland and West Virginia, was redesignated Interstate 68. Route descriptionWest Virginia= US 48 begins as a four-lane divided highway at an interchange with Interstate 79 outside Weston. It follows the valley of Stonecoal Creek and then Fink Run until it crosses the Buckhannon River at Buckhannon. It then cuts across the Allegheny Plateau, and crosses through the water gap of the Tygart Valley River between Rich Mountain and Laurel Mountain to reach Elkins. It then travels north up the Leading Creek valley. At Kerens the divided highway ends, and the US 48 designation follows U.S. Route 219 as it continues up Leading Creek, turns east across to travel down Haddix Run, crosses the Cheat River at Parsons, and then crosses the Allegheny Mountains highlands to Thomas. At this point, it briefly follows West Virginia Route 32 to Davis, after which it again becomes a four-lane divided highway. US 48 travels up Beaver Creek and passes by Mount Storm Lake. US 48 then descends the Allegheny Front near Bismarck. It then crosses Patterson Creek Mountain to reach Moorefield, where it crosses the South Branch Potomac River. It then ascends South Branch Mountain, during which it crosses the Clifford Hollow Bridge, and then descends to Baker. The highway then follows the Lost River and Cacapon River down to Wardensville, where the four-lane highway again ends. It then ascends to the ridge of Great North Mountain, where it crosses the border into Virginia. =Virginia= US 48 is fully signed along the portion of current State Route 55 (Virginia SR 55) west of I-81. The route begins at the West Virginia state line at the highway's summit of Great North Mountain, signed as US 48 and WV 55 from Wardensville. Entering Virginia, US 48 heads northeast as two-lane Wardensville Pike through George Washington National Forest and descends the mountain to the hamlet of Star Tannery, where the highway leaves Frederick County by crossing Cedar Creek. The road's name changes to John Marshall Highway, and it passes around the northern end of Little North Mountain near the community of Wheatfield, turning south. US 48 passes through the Shenandoah County communities of Lebanon Church and Clary on its way to a diamond interchange with I-81, which serves as US 48's eastern terminus. History Special mileposts identify U.S. 48 as part of Appalachian Development Highway System Corridor H. The Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 was passed as part of an effort to stimulate economic growth in Appalachian rural areas. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was created by the act, which also authorized the ARC to create the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). The Appalachian region, as defined by the act, stretches from Mississippi to New York. Congress defined it to \\"provide a highway system which, in conjunction with the Interstate System and other Federal-aid highways in the Appalachian region, will open up an area or areas where commerce and communication have been inhibited by lack of adequate access\\". Some 23 transportation corridors were to be developed as part of the ADHS, and Corridor H was designated in 1965. Corridor H has had a particularly controversial history as conservationists and environmentalists vied with federal agents, developers and the business community over the issue of what constituted the most environmentally sensitive route among several alternatives. This current designation for Corridor H is inconsistent with the AASHTO numbering scheme, which places east–west U.S. Routes in ascending numerical order southward across the continental U.S. The current route is located south of US 50 and north of US 60 and therefore should have a route number in the 50s. Corridor H was originally envisioned as an Appalachian Regional Development (ARD) corridor highway that was to run from Weston, West Virginia to Strasburg or New Market, Virginia via Elkins, West Virginia. This proposed four-lane highway soon became one of the most controversial APD corridor highways in West Virginia that would lead to numerous legal (and political) battles within the state. The state was forced to deal with numerous Environmental and economic issues, a battle that would continue for 40 years. =Lawsuits and settlements= Corridor H Alternatives (CHA) filed a lawsuit, the first for the project since its realignment, in U.S. District Court in November 1996 challenging the Record of Decision for the entire Corridor H project.Corridor H Pressroom. 7 February 2000. West Virginia Department of Transportation. 20 March 2003 .Corridor H Pressroom. 7 February 2000. West Virginia Department of Transportation. 20 March 2003 . The lawsuit stated that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) violated the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) by \\"failing to consider an improved roadway alternative (IRA) and by failing to prepare a Supplemental EIS to consider the impacts of the Corrick's Ford Battlefield alignment shift.\\" The lawsuit further states that the FHWA \\"violated laws by issuing a Record of Decision prior to completing the evaluation of Corridor H's impacts\\" on historic structures and lands.Corridor H. Stewards of the Potomac Highlands. 2005. 31 May 2005 . In 1997, briefs were filed and oral arguments took place. In October, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the Federal Highway Administration and the West Virginia Department of Transportation on all counts, however, CHA appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Briefs were once again filed in 1998 and oral arguments were presented throughout the year. In September, the CHA filed a second lawsuit that challenged the FHWA's findings of \\"no constructive\\" use for two properties. In November of that year, the Court system ordered the Department of Transportation to halt construction of Corridor H except for a section near Elkins. In 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the FHWA and the West Virginia Department of Transportation on the first lawsuit. On the second lawsuit, the court ruled in favor of CHA, stating that \\"all studies of historic properties must be completed before construction proceeds.\\" In March, the Court dismissed the second lawsuit without prejudice, and allowed the CHA to file a new lawsuit challenging the decisions of the FHWA and the West Virginia Department of Transportation when Section 106/section 4(f) is complete for the entire Corridor H project. In May, a court order was produced that prohibited the FHWA from proceeding further with Corridor H until they have completed the Section 106 process and issued an amended Record of Decision. There were two exceptions to this however: work was allowed to proceed on the \\"Northern Elkins Bypass\\" and design work was allowed to proceed. This was the segment of Corridor H between Elkins and Kerens, or Phase I. In December 1999, an agreement was reached. The Corridor H project was to be divided into nine separate projects from Elkins, West Virginia to the Virginia state line. As stated in the agreement, impacts were to be avoided near Corricks Ford/Shavers Fork Valley and Blackwater Canyon; the completion of ongoing studies; and the deferment of the Wardensville, West Virginia to Virginia state line segment with final design and right-of-way acquisition restricted until specific conditions are met not to exceed 20 years. This delay could be shortened if Virginia approves their section of Corridor H (US 48) between the West Virginia state line and Interstate 81, if traffic increases significantly on WV 55 between Wardensville and the state line, or if it is required to ensue eligibility for Appalachian highway corridor funding. The agreement also established alternative dispute resolution procedures and that the plaintiffs were to waive the right to bring future lawsuits against the FHWA and the West Virginia Department of Transportation that would seek any further study of any alternative that does not include completing Corridor H as a continuous four-lane highway. One of the leading firms on the Corridor H project, the Michael Baker Corporation proposed and designed two wetland mitigation sites.\\"Appalachian Highway Corridor H\\". Michael Baker Corporation. 2004. 31 May 2005 . In addition, Baker, in conjunction with the West Virginia Department of Highways and the Federal Highway Administration, developed a \\"comprehensive mitigation plan for vegetative, water quality, acid drainage and wildlife issues for the entire 100+-mile long project.\\" Michael Baker Corporation's scientists also completed extensive surveys for endangered plant and animal species. Identified were the buffalo clover, the Indiana bat, the Virginia big-eared bat, Cheat Mountain salamander and the West Virginia northern flying squirrel. Based on this, Baker assisted the Department of Highways and the FHWA in conjunction with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to prepare a biological assessment for the Indiana bat, which resulted in a finding that Corridor H will not adversely affect the habitat. A formal consultation is ongoing for the West Virginia northern flying squirrel. =Weston to Elkins= The route was to follow U.S. Route 33 from Weston to Seneca Rocks, West Virginia, where two alignments to the east were proposed. One alignment would follow a new alignment over North Fork Mountain and Foremost Mountain to New Market, Virginia, while another proposal called for an alignment paralleling WV 55/VA 55 to Strasburg, Virginia. A timeline of construction completions are:Release Date Report. West Virginia Department of Transportation. August 2003. * 1972: Milepost 19.62 to 20.61 opened to traffic. This was at the Interstate 79 interchange in Lewis County. * 1975: Corridor H was extended further east from milepost 20.61 to 23.62 at Horner and County Route 15 in Lewis County. * 1976: A six-mile (10 km) segment was opened to traffic from milepost 23.62 at Horner and County Route 15 in Lewis County to the Upshur County line (MP 27.04), and from milepost 0 to 1.22 in Upshur County near Lorentz. Also completed was the \\"racetrack\\" portion of Corridor H east of Elkins, from Canfield to Bowden. A northern bypass of Elkins was to connect the \\"racetrack\\" to portions of Corridor H west of the city. This bypass was never constructed. * 1979: Three miles were completed in Upshur County from milepost 1.22 to 4.35 near Lorentz. * 1991: A three-mile (5 km) section of highway opened from milepost 4.35 near Lorentz to 8.31 at Buckhannon in Upshur County. * 1994: The longest section of Corridor H from Weston to Elkins opened from milepost 8.31 to 15.40 in Upshur County, continuing into Barbour County from mileposts 0 to 4.43, and into Randolph county from mileposts 0 to 4.17. The total mileage for the final Weston to Elkins segment came in at . Approximately was completed from Interstate 79 at Weston to Elkins. =Elkins to the Virginia state line= Another segment was completed from Canfield to Bowden just east of Elkins and was dubbed the \\"racetrack\\" for its vast improvement over the old alignment and its isolation from other four-lane highways. A northern bypass of Elkins was to connect the two segments of Corridor H, however, it was never constructed as the segments east of Bowden were met with intense opposition. Meanwhile, an alignment following U.S. Highway 33 to Seneca Rocks and then WV 55/VA 55 to Strasburg, Virginia was favored within the West Virginia Department of Transportation. In 1981, the West Virginia Department of Transportation began planning for a new alignment east of Bowden along U.S. Highway 33 and WV 55/VA 55.\\"Corridor H Alternatives.\\" Corridor H Alternatives Inc. 1999. 31 May 2005 .\\"Corridor H Pro.\\" West Virginia Department of Transportation 20 March 2003. December 2000 . A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was issued. Funding issues, however, caused the project to be put on hold until 1990. No Final Environmental Impact Statements or Record of Decisions were completed. In 1990, the project was resurrected and a reevaluation of the Corridor H alignment east of Bowden was conducted. A new DEIS was prepared and all corridors considered in the 1981 DEIS were studied equally. Scoping meetings were held that October. The purpose and need documentation was completed in March 1992 and a Corridor Selection Draft Environmental Impact Statement (CSDEIS) was completed in October. In 1993, a revised EIS was published with a new route to go north from Elkins to Moorefield and then into Virginia. Many citizens, however, felt that improving existing routes would be a better alternative. Of the 4,000 comments written in 1995 at public meetings, over half opposed the new Corridor H alignment. They cited the damage to two national forests, 41 streams, historical sites, Civil War battlefields, farms and Main Street businesses. For some, the costs outweighed the benefits. In October 1994, an Alignment Selection Draft Environmental Impact Statement (ASDEIS) was issued. The DEIS focused on alignment selection within the preferred corridor identified within the CSDEIS. In April 1996, a Federal Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was issued that consisted of a revised version of the ASDEIS along with some of the CSDEIS. In September, a Record of Decision was issued on the preferred alignment east of Bowden. Phase 1: Elkins to Kerens In October 1998, the first contract for Corridor H's construction east of Elkins was awarded from US 33 to US 219. A segment of Corridor H opened to traffic on August 12, 2002.Corridor H Press Room. 5 August 2002. West Virginia Department of Transportation. 20 March 2003 .Corridor H Route - Elkins to Kerens. West Virginia Department of Transportation. 20 March 2003 . This segment of four-lane expressway stretches from CR 11 west of Elkins to CR 7 near Kerens and includes one interchange in the project for U.S. Highway 219. This was finished under six contracts totaling $87.6 million. The then-Governor Bob Wise celebrated the historic opening with Senator Robert C. Byrd and Transportation Secretary Fred VanKirk. On August 19, a three-mile (5 km) segment was dedicated from CR 1 to CR 23/4 that was constructed under two contracts totalling $24.1 million. This completed the nine-mile (14 km) phase one segment. Phase 2: Kerens to Parsons This segment of Corridor H travels through Randolph and Tucker counties; more specifically from County Route 7 near Kerens to a future U.S. Highway 219 interchange approximately two miles east of Parsons. Proceeding northward from County Route 7, it would have a span at Wilmouth Run and County Route 3. The alignment then turns more northeastward, entering the Monongahela National Forest, crossing the South Branch of Hadix Run Road and U.S. Highway 219. It has one final water crossing at Cheat River before concluding at County Route 219/4. In Parsons, a public informational meeting was held on September 26, 2000. Alignments were studied and a Settlement Agreement allowed construction to continue on segments in Hardy and Randolph counties. It was also chosen to avoid the Corricks Ford Battlefield. Alternative \\"DF\\" was chosen as the preferred alternative for the highway and in October 2001, the Federal Highway Administration gave the go-ahead for the Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement.Corridor H Route - Kerens to Parsons. West Virginia Department of Transportation. 20 March 2003 . The Federal Environment Impact Statement was completed in April 2002 with the Record of Decision approved in June of that year. The Department of Highways received approval for the Supplemental Final Environmental Impact Statement in October 2002. The commenting period was extended 60 days to February 25, 2003. The Amended Record of Decision was approved on May 12, 2003. Six consultants were hired to provide the final design for the segment of Corridor H from Kerens to Parsons. Final design has not yet been completed, with construction of the segment from Kerens to a point north of the Randolph County/Tucker County border (but not all the way to Parsons) scheduled to begin in mid-2016.The Route - Kerens to Parsons April–June 2015 Status . Phase 3: Parsons to Davis Phase III is a nine-mile (14 km) expressway from two miles (3 km) east of Parsons to immediately east of Davis along West Virginia Route 93 within Tucker County. On December 4, 2002, the Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement was approved after additional Environmental investigations were completed. The additional analysis was a result of the West Virginia Northern Flying Squirrel, a federally endangered species that was discovered in the vicinity. A public hearing was held on February 6, 2003 at the Blackwater Lodge in Davis, with comments on the meeting turned in by April 22. The Thomas-Davis city council had until June 19 to review the situation. The Supplemental Final Environmental Impact Statement was expected to be approved on the segment in June 2005, with the FHWA expected to sign the Amended Record of Decision in August 2005, however, the discovery of the West Virginia Northern Flying Squirrel delayed the project; WVDOH had to conduct additional environmental investigations.Corridor H Route - Parsons to Davis. West Virginia Department of Transportation. 20 March 2003 .Corridor H - Davis / Thomas - Public Meetings. West Virginia Department of Transportation. 20 March 2003 . The Supplemental Final Environmental Impact Statement (SFEIS) was approved in 2007. However, a reevaluation of the SFEIS is underway, specifically for updated endangered species surveys. The issuance of the Amended Record of Decision (AROD) is to be determined. Final design is anticipated to begin in 2025, and construction is scheduled to begin in 2031. Phase 4: Davis to Bismarck U.S. 48 crosses the Eastern Continental Divide at the border between Tucker County and Grant County. This segment of Corridor H stretches through Tucker and Grant counties. The alignment runs from West Virginia Route 93, east of West Virginia Route 32 near Davis to Bismarck near the intersection of West Virginia Route 42 and West Virginia Route 93. The Federal Highway Administration issued a record of decision on March 23, 2001 that cleared the way for design, right-of-way purchases, and construction for this segment. A contract was awarded in December 2010 to Trumbull Corporation for the construction of 6.2 miles of Corridor H, from the existing corridor at Bismarck in Grant County to the WV 93 connector at Mount Storm in Tucker County; this section opened by November 2014. A contract was awarded in August 2012 to JF Allen for the construction of the remaining 9.9 miles portion of the Davis to Bismarck section, from east of WV 32 to the WV 93 Connector at Mount Storm, and this section opened in November 2016.Corridor H Route - Davis to Bismarck. West Virginia Department of Transportation. Dec. 2016 . Phase 5: Bismarck to Forman U.S. 48 descends the Allegheny Front near the Greenland Gap. This completed section totals within Grant County. The record of decision was issued in July 2001. The original timeline was to begin acquiring right-of-way in June 2003, bid contracts in August 2004 and begin construction in September 2004 with a completion date in September 2006. Greenland Gap activists, however, began documenting the Gap's civil war history and natural features and successfully persuaded the West Virginia Department of Highways to move the alignment 1/4 of a mile away from the Gap. This spared several houses in a neighboring village and reduced the effect the highway would have on the Gap. A one-mile (1.6 km) access road between the village of Greenland and West Virginia Route 93 was eliminated and an interchange was moved from between Greenland and West Virginia Route 93 to two miles (3 km) north of Scherr for West Virginia Route 93. Construction began in spring 2007 and completed in November 2013. The section from County Route 3 east to Forman and Moorefield opened in October 2010.Corridor H Route - Bismarck to Forman. West Virginia Department of Transportation. 1 Oct. 2006 . A further section from WV 93 to CR 3 opened on October 23, 2012.

This phase of Corridor H (US 48) stretches from Wardensville to West Virginia Route 55 at the Virginia state line. As part of the agreement, the Federal Highway Administration and the West Virginia Department of Transportation would defer construction, along with final design and right-of-way acquisition on the section of roadway between Wardensville and the Virginia state line for as long as 20 years. This delay could be shortened if Virginia approves their section of Corridor H (US 48) between the West Virginia state line and Interstate 81, if traffic increases significantly on West Virginia Route 55 between Wardensville and the state line, or if required to ensue eligibility for Appalachian highway corridor funding.

While State Route 55 will not be the final alignment of Corridor H through this region, it will be a temporary transition as West Virginia completes their portions to the state line. Virginia also designated State Route 55 a Virginia Scenic Byway. Plans are in the works with VDOT to maintain the existing facility and continue to make spot improvements.

It includes parking areas, restroom facilities, and walking trails. These projects will total approximately and cost around $1.5 million. Two segments that were constructed from Parsons to Montrose and from Montrose to Elkins were awarded on February 20, 2001. It was named the Allegheny Highland Trail. =Environmental measures= The Division of Highways received the Federal Highway Administration's 2001 Environmental Award in the cultural resources category for the educational tools and web sites based on the Reed Farmstead archaeological dig on Corridor H.\\"WVDOH Receives National Award.\\" Corridor H Pressroom. 23 April 2001. West Virginia Department of Transportation. 20 March 2003 . State Highway Engineer Joe Deneault explained when the 200-year-old farm was discovered, the Division of Highways wanted to share the process of how the Hardy County family's home would be uncovered and preserved. \\"We wanted to share this process with the public,\\" Deneault said. \\" The Reed Farmstead was an amazing discovery and we decided that a video and web sites would be the best way to share this extensive archaeological dig with area residents. As the project progressed, it was clear that this could be an important educational tool for students as well.\\" An educational video was produced that illustrated the step-by-step process in the identification and preservation procedures taken by WVDOH. The video was shown for 60 days on the Corridor H web site and a videocassette was mailed to every school teaching grades eighth through twelfth in the state. The WVDOH also developed two web sites based on the project: , that offers the history of the farm and details about the dig, and , which is an interactive site for children. The award was presented to the WVDOH and to the two consultants, Michael Baker Jr., Inc. and Charles Ryan Associates, working on this project at a ceremony in Washington, D. C. on April 20. =Connecting highway= Maryland and West Virginia have begun planning an upgraded U.S. Route 220, possibly as an extension of Corridor O, to connect Corridor H to Interstate 68 near Cumberland, MD. Committees in Cumberland, Keyser, and Moorefield have been created to discuss the highway and thus far several plans have been established but one individual plan has not yet been chosen. Major intersectionsPrevious uses of the designation US 48 is one of the newest additions to the United States Numbered Highway system, having been commissioned in 2002. Before this designation, sections east of Moorefield, West Virginia to I-81 were known as West Virginia SR 55 and SR 55, and sections north of Elkins, West Virginia were known as US 219\\\\. West Virginia has US 48 signed sparsely within its borders for unimproved sections of the planned highway. US 48 is one of the few U.S. Route numbers to be used three times for three separate roadways. The first use of US 48 was in the 1920s, in Northern California, before being absorbed by US 50\\\\. The original \\"US 48\\" was one of the original routes in the United States Numbered Highways system. Assigned in 1926, it ran between US 99 at French Camp, California, outside Stockton, and US 101 at San Jose, California. By 1931, however, the route had been deleted. Most of the route later became part of US 50\\\\. US 48 was the first US highway to be deleted in California. Then, US 48 was designated for what is now I-68 before it entered the Interstate Highway System. Constructed as Corridor E of the ADHS as a replacement for a particularly primitive section of US 40, it was initially numbered US 48 when construction began in 1965; in 1991, however, it was redesignated as an interstate route.

As a hit-driven business, the great majority of the video game industry's software releases have been commercial failures. In the early 21st century, industry commentators made these general estimates: 10% of published games generated 90% of revenue;Mapping the Canadian Video and Computer Game Industry from The Canadian Video Game Industry with data from the (PDF) that around 3% of PC games and 15% of console games have global sales of more than 100,000 units per year, with even this level insufficient to make high-budget games profitable; and that about 20% of games make any profit.Video Game Makers Go Hollywood. Uh-Oh. from The New York Times Some of these failure events have drastically changed the video game market since its origin in the late 1970s. For example, the failures of E.T. and Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 contributed to the video game crash of 1983. Some games, though commercial failures, are well received by certain groups of gamers and are considered cult games.  Video game hardware failures  3DO Interactive Multiplayer = The Goldstar 3DO Interactive Multiplayer Co-designed by R. J. Mical and the team behind the Amiga, and marketed by Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins, this \\"multimedia machine\\" released in 1993 was marketed as a family entertainment device and not just a video game console. Though it supports a vast library of games including many exceptional third party releases, a refusal to reduce its price of until almost the end of the product's life hampered sales. The success of subsequent next generation systems led to the platform's demise and the company's exit from the hardware market. This exit also included The 3DO Company's sale of the platform's successor, the M2, to its investor Matsushita.Matsushita to apply M2 tech to video editing Television Digest with Consumer Electronics, March 2, 1998 = Amstrad GX4000 and Amstrad CPC+ range = In 1990, Amstrad attempted to enter the console video game market with hardware based on its successful Amstrad CPC range but also capable of playing cartridge-based games with improved graphics and sound. This comprised the Amstrad CPC+ computers, including the same features as the existing CPCs, and the dedicated GX4000 console. However, only a few months later the Mega Drive, a much-anticipated 16-bit console, was released in Europe, and the GX4000's aging 8-bit technology proved uncompetitive. Many of the games are direct ports of existing CPC games (available more cheaply on tape or disc) with few if any graphical improvements. Fewer than thirty games were released on cartridge, and the GX4000's failure ended Amstrad's involvement in the video game industry. The CPC+ range fared little better, as 8-bit computers had been all but superseded by similarly priced 16-bit machines such as the Amiga, though software hacks now make the advanced console graphics and sound accessible to users. = Apple Bandai Pippin = The Bandai Pippin (Atmark Player) and wireless controller The Pippin is a game console designed by Apple Computer and produced by Bandai (now Bandai Namco) in the mid-1990s based around a PowerPC 603e processor and Classic Mac OS. It featured a 4x CD-ROM drive and a video output that could connect to a standard television monitor. Apple intended to license the technology to third parties; however, only two companies signed on, Bandai and Katz Media, while the only Pippin license to release a product to market was Bandai's. By the time the Bandai Pippin was released (1995 in Japan, 1996 in the United States), the market was already dominated by the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation. The Bandai Pippin also cost US$599 on launch, more expensive than the competition. Total sales were only around 42,000 units.25 worst Tech Products of All Time PC World, May 26, 2006 = Atari 5200 = The Atari 5200 was created as the successor to the highly successful Atari 2600. Reasons for the console's poor reception include that most of the games were simply enhanced versions of those played on its predecessor and its awkward controller design. The console sold only a little over a million units. When it was discontinued, its predecessor was marketed for several more years, as was its successor, the Atari 7800, which was marketed more carefully to avoid a similar debacle. Nonetheless, the failure of the Atari 5200 marked the beginning of Atari's fall in the console business. = Atari Jaguar = The redesigned controller, dubbed the \\"ProController\\", included additional action buttons Released by Atari Corporation in 1993, this 64-bit system was more powerful than its contemporaries, the Genesis and the Super NES (hence its \\"Do the Math\\" slogan); however, its sales were hurt by a lack of software and a number of crippling business practices on the part of Atari senior management. The controller was widely criticized as being too big and unwieldy, with a baffling number of buttons. The system never attained critical mass in the market before the release of the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, and without strong leadership to drive a recovery, it failed and brought the company down with it.Atari Jaguar History , AtariAge.com. Rob Bricken of Topless Robot described the Jaguar as \\"an unfortunate system, beleaguered by software droughts, rushed releases, and a lot of terrible, terrible games.\\" = Atari Lynx = The Lynx handheld console Released in 1989 in North America and Europe; later in Japan in 1990 by Atari Corporation, The Atari Lynx is a 16 bit handheld game console that is the world's first handheld electronic game system with a color LCD. The Lynx was the second handheld game system to be released with the Atari name. The system was originally developed by Epyx as the Handy Game. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and ambidextrous layout. In late 1991, it was reported that Atari sales estimates were about 800,000, which Atari claimed was within their expected projections. In comparison, the Game Boy sold 16 million units by later that year. Overall lifetime sales were confirmed as being in the region of 3 million, a commercial failure despite positive critical reviews. In 1996, Atari Corporation collapsed due to the failures of the Lynx and Jaguar consoles.Sample Contracts - Agreement and Plan of Reorganization - Atari Corp. and JT Storage Inc. - Competitive Intelligence for Investors = Bally Astrocade = The Bally Astrocade is a second generation console created by Bally. It was released in 1977 but only through mail order. Due to weak sales, Bally quit the console business. Shortly afterward, another company purchased the rights to the console, and re-released it to weak sales again. Prominent games journalist Shaun Bradley described the Astrocade as \\"Worse than The Room\\". = Commodore 64 Games System = Released only in Europe in 1990, the C64GS was basically a Commodore 64 redesigned as a cartridge-based console. Aside from some hardware issues, the console did not get much attention from the public, who preferred to buy the cheaper original computer that had far more possibilities. Also, the console appeared just as the 16-bit era was starting, which left no chance for it to succeed as it was unable to compete with consoles like the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Mega Drive. = Commodore CDTV = The CDTV was launched by Commodore in 1991. In common with the Philips CD-i and the 3DO, the CDTV was intended as an all-in-one home multimedia appliance that would play games, music, movies, and other interactive content. The name was short for \\"Commodore Dynamic Total Vision\\". The hardware was based on the Amiga computer with a single-speed CD-ROM drive rather than a floppy disk drive, in a case that was designed to integrate unobtrusively with a home entertainment center. However, the expected market for home multimedia appliances did not materialize, and the CDTV was discontinued in 1993, having sold only 30,000 units. Commodore's next attempt at a CD-based console, the Amiga CD32, was considerably more successful. = digiBlast = The digiBlast portable console was launched by Nikko at the end of 2005 and promised to be a cheap alternative (selling at $117.86 or thereabouts and featuring a hardware similar to the Game Boy Advance) to the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. Cartridges for games, cartoon episodes (Winx Club, SpongeBob SquarePants), and music videos were released on the handheld. A cartridge for MP3 playback and a cartridge with a 1.3-megapixel camera were released as add-ons. However, a shortage of chips around the release date resulted in a failed launch and loss of consumer interest.digiBLAST Has Landed - GizmododigiBLAST at GreyInnovation = Dreamcast = Sega Dreamcast and controller. The Dreamcast served as Sega's final console. The Dreamcast, released globally in 1999, was Sega's final console before the company focused entirely on software. Although the console was initially successful and management in the company improved significantly after harsh lessons were learned from the Sega Saturn fiasco, the console also faced stiff competition from the technically superior PlayStation 2 despite being in the market months ahead. The Dreamcast sold less than the Saturn, coming in at 9.13 million units compared to the Saturn's 9.5 million. The console's development was subject to further stress by an economic recession that struck Japan shortly after the console's release, forcing Sega, among other companies, to cut costs in order to survive. = Fairchild Channel F = The Fairchild Channel F was a second generation console released in 1976, and the first home console unit to use interchangeable video game cartridges. When the Atari 2600, which also used cartridges, was released a year later, the console was completely overshadowed. Only 250,000 Channel F units were sold. = FM Towns Marty = The FM Towns Marty is a fifth generation console manufactured by Fujitsu. Throughout its few years in the market, the console sold an underwhelming 45,000 units. = Gizmondo = The Gizmondo, a handheld video game device featuring GPS and a digital camera, was released by Tiger Telematics in the UK, Sweden and the U.S. starting in March 2005. With poor promotion, few games (only fourteen were ever released), short battery life, a small screen, competition from the cheaper and more reputable Nintendo DS and PSP, and controversy surrounding the company, the system was a commercial failure. Several high-ranking Tiger executives were subsequently arrested for fraud and other illegal activities related to the Gizmondo. gamerevolution.com It is so far the world's worst selling handheld console in history, and due to its failure in the European and American video game markets, it was not released in Australia or Japan. Tiger Telematics went bankrupt when it was discontinued in February 2006, just 11 months after it was released. = HyperScan = Released in late 2006 by Mattel, the HyperScan was the company's first video game console since the Intellivision. It used radio frequency identification (RFID) along with traditional video game technology. The console used UDF format CD-ROMs. Games retailed for $19.99 and the console itself for $69.99 at launch, but at the end of its very short lifespan, prices of the system were down to $9.99, the games $1.99, and booster packs $0.99. The system was sold in two varieties, a cube, and a 2-player value pack. The cube box version was the version sold in stores. It included the system, controller, an X-Men game disc, and 6 X-Men cards. Two player value packs were sold online (but may have been liquidated in stores) and included an extra controller and 12 additional X-Men cards. \\\\- Site archived by Wayback Machine The system was discontinued in 2007 due to poor console, game, and card pack sales. It is featured as one of the ten worst systems ever by PC World magazine. = Neo Geo CD = Released in Japan and Europe in 1994 and a year later in North America, the Neo Geo CD was first unveiled at the 1994 Tokyo Toy Show. Three versions of the Neo Geo CD were released: a front-loading version only distributed in Japan, a top-loading version marketed worldwide, and the Neo Geo CDZ, an upgraded, faster-loading version released in Japan only. The front-loading version was the original console design, with the top- loading version developed shortly before the Neo Geo CD launch as a scaled- down, cheaper alternative model. The CDZ was released on December 29, 1995http://www.obsolete-tears.com/snk-neogeo-cd-machine-226.html as the Japanese market replacement for SNK's previous efforts (the \\"front loader\\" and the \\"top loader\\"). The Neo Geo CD had met with limited success due to it being plagued with slow loading times that could vary from 30 to 60 seconds between loads, depending on the game. Although SNK's American home entertainment division quickly acknowledged that the system simply was unable to compete with the 3D-able powerhouse systems of the day like Nintendo's 64, Sega's Saturn and Sony's PlayStation, SNK corporate of Japan felt they could continue to maintain profitable sales in the Japanese home market by shortening the previous system's load-times. Their Japanese division had produced an excess number of single speed units and found that modifying these units to double speed was more expensive than they had initially thought, so SNK opted to sell them as they were, postponing production of a double speed model until they had sold off the stock of single speed units. As of March 1997, the Neo Geo CD had sold 570,000 units worldwide.Consoles +, issue 73 Although this was the last known home console released under SNK's Neo Geo line, the newly reincarnated SNK Playmore relaunched the Neo Geo line with the release of the Neo Geo X in 2012. = Neo Geo Pocket and Pocket Color = The two handheld video game consoles, created by SNK Playmore (formerly SNK Corporation), were released between 1998-99 through markets dominated by Nintendo. The Neo Geo Pocket is considered to be an unsuccessful console, as it was immediately succeeded by the Color, a full color device allowing the system to compete more easily with the dominant Game Boy Color handheld, and which also saw a western release. Though the system enjoyed only a short life, there were some significant games released on the system. After a good sales start in both the U.S. and Japan with 14 launch titles (a record at the time) subsequent low retail support in the U.S., lack of communication with third-party developers by SNK's American management, the craze about Nintendo's Pokémon franchise, anticipation of the 32-bit Game Boy Advance, as well as strong competition from Bandai's WonderSwan in Japan, led to a sales decline in both regions. Meanwhile, SNK had been in financial trouble for at least a year – the company soon collapsed, and was purchased by American pachinko manufacturer Aruze in January 2000. History for SNK Corporation Eventually on June 13, 2000, Aruze decided to quit the North American and European markets, marking the end of SNK's worldwide operations and the discontinuation of Neo Geo hardware and software there. The Neo Geo Pocket Color (and other SNK/Neo Geo products) did however, last until 2001 in Japan. It was SNK's last video game console, as the company went bust on October 22, 2001. Though commercially failed, the Neo Geo Pocket and Pocket Color had been regarded as influential systems. The life and times of the Neo Geo Pocket Color It also featured an arcade-style microswitched 'clicky stick' joystick, which was praised for its accuracy and being well-suited for fighting games. The Pocket Color system's display and 40-hour battery life were also well received. Although these were the last known systems released under SNK's Neo Geo line, the newly reincarnated SNK Playmore relaunched the Neo Geo line with the release of the Neo Geo X in 2012. = Nintendo 64DD = The Nintendo 64 (top) connected to 64DD (bottom) A disk drive add-on and Internet appliance for the Nintendo 64, it was first announced at 1995's Nintendo Shoshinkai game show event (now called Nintendo World). The 64DD was repeatedly and notoriously delayed until its release in Japan on December 1, 1999. Nintendo, anticipating poor sales, sold the 64DD through mail order and bundled with its Randnet dialup subscription service instead of directly to retailers or consumers. As a result, the 64DD was supported by Nintendo for only a short period of time and only nine games were released for it. Most 64DD games were either canceled entirely, released as normal Nintendo 64 cartridges or ported to other systems such as Nintendo's next-generation GameCube. Upon announcement of the cancellation of Randnet in 2001, Nintendo reported a total of 15,000 current 64DD users on Randnet. = N-Gage = The N-Gage was a smartphone combining features of a mobile phone and a handheld game system Made by the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer Nokia, and released in 2003, the N-Gage is a small handheld console, designed to combine a feature-packed mobile/cellular phone with a handheld games console. The system was mocked for its taco-like design, and sales were so poor that the system's price dropped by $100 within a week of its release. Common complaints included the difficulty of swapping games (the cartridge slot was located beneath the battery slot, requiring its removal) and the fact that its cellphone feature required users to hold the device \\"sideways\\" (i.e. the long edge of the system) against their cheek.Nokia's Folly CNN Money, October 6, 2003 A redesigned version, the N-Gage QD, was released to eliminate these complaints. However, the N-Gage brand still suffered from a poor reputation and the QD did not address the popular complaint that the control layout was \\"too cluttered.\\" The N-Gage failed to reach the popularity of the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, or the Sony PSP. In November 2005, Nokia announced the failure of its product, in light of poor sales (fewer than three million units sold during the platform's three-year run, against projections of six million), and while video game software is still being produced for its Series 60 phones, Nokia ceased to consider gaming a corporate priority until 2007, when it expected improved screen sizes and quality to increase demand.Nokia holds fire on mobile gaming vuunet.com, Nov 23, 2005 However, Nokia's presence in the cell phone market was soon eclipsed by the iPhone and later Android phones, causing development to gravitate to them and sealing the fate of the N-Gage brand. In 2012, Nokia abandoned development on the Symbian OS which was the base for N-Gage and transitioned to the Windows Phone. = Nuon = The Nuon was a DVD decoding chip from VM Labs that was also a fully programmable CPU with graphics and sound capabilities. The idea was that a manufacturer could use the chip instead of an existing MPEG-2 decoder, thus turning a DVD player into a game console. A year after launch only eight games were available. One game, Iron Soldier 3, was recalled for not being compatible with all systems. = Ouya = The Ouya is an Android based microconsole released in 2013. Even though the Ouya was a success on Kickstarter, the product was plagued by problems from the beginning. The console was very slow to ship and suffered hardware issues. On top of this, the console had a very limited library of games. The critical reception ranged from lukewarm to outright calling the console a 'scam'. Just two years after its release, the Ouya was in a dire financial situation and negotiated a buyout with Razer. Razer continued to run software services for Ouya until June 2019, on which the company deactivated all accounts and online services, rendering most apps unusable. = PC-FX = The PC-FX is the Japan-exclusive successor to the PC Engine (aka TurboGrafx-16), released by NEC in late 1994. Originally intended to compete with the Super Famicom and the Mega Drive, it instead wound up competing with the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo 64. The console's 32-bit architecture was created in 1992, and by 1994 it was outdated, largely due to the fact that it was unable to create 3D images, instead utilizing an architecture that relied on JPEG video. The PC-FX was severely underpowered compared to other fifth generation consoles and had a very low budget marketing campaign, with the system never managing to gain a foothold against its competition or a significant part of the marketshare. The PC-FX was discontinued in early 1998 so that NEC could focus on providing graphics processing units for the upcoming Sega Dreamcast. Around this time, NEC announced that they had only sold 100,000 units with a library of only 62 titles, most of which were dating sims. = CD-i = The CD-i received heavy criticism for its lackluster games. In the 1980s, electronics company Philips together with Sony developed a new CD-based format called CD-i (Compact Disc Interactive) for various multimedia software. The first consumer-oriented player from Philips launched in 1991 with a launch price of $700 (). Although not technically a game console, Philips increasingly marketed the format as a video game platform from 1994 onwards.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB835915768416880000 It was originally intended to be an add-on for the Super NES, but the deal fell through. Nintendo, however, did give Philips the rights and permission to use five Nintendo characters for the CD-i games. In 1993, Philips released two Zelda games, Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon. A year later, Philips released another Zelda game, Zelda's Adventure, and a few months later, a Mario game titled Hotel Mario. All four of these Nintendo-themed games are commonly cited by critics as being among the worst ever made. Much criticism was also aimed at the CD-i's controller. Although the Philips CD-i was extensively marketed by Philips, consumer interest remained low. Sales began to slow down by 1994, and in 1998, Philips announced that the product had been discontinued. In all, roughly 570,000 units were sold, with 133 games released. = LaserActive = Made by the Pioneer LaserDisc Corporation in 1993 (a clone was produced by NEC as well), the LaserActive employed the trademark LaserDiscs as a medium for presenting games and also played the original LaserDisc movies. The LD-ROMs, as they were called, could hold 540 MB of data and up to 60 minutes of analog audio and video. In addition, expansion modules could be bought which allowed the LaserActive to play Genesis and/or TurboGrafx-16 games, among other things. Very poor marketing combined with a high price tag for both the console itself ($969 in 1993) and the various modules (e.g., $599 for the Genesis module compared to $89 for the base console and $229 for Sega CD add-on to play CD-ROM based games) caused it to be quickly ignored by both the gaming public and the video game press. allgame Less than 40 games were produced in all (at about $120 each),Pink Godzilla - Pioneer LaserActive> almost all of which required the purchase of one of the modules, and games built for one module could not be used with another. The LaserActive was quietly discontinued one year later after total sales of roughly 10,000 units. = PlayStation Classic = PlayStation Classic and PS1 controller Following the release of Nintendo's NES Classic Edition and SNES Classic Edition, microconsoles that included over 20 preloaded classic games from those respective systems, Sony followed suit with the PlayStation Classic. Like the Nintendo systems, the PlayStation Classic was presented as a smaller form factor of the original PlayStation preloaded with 20 games. It was launched in early December 2018 with a suggested retail price of . The system was heavily criticized at launch. For nine of the games, it used PAL versions (favored in European markets) rather than NTSC, meaning they ran at a slower 50 Hz clock compared to the 60 Hz used in the Americas, which caused notable frame rate problems and impacted the gameplay style for some of the more highly-interactive titles. The emulation also lacked the feature set that Nintendo had set with its microconsoles. The included game list, while varied by region, also was noted to lack many of the titles that had made the original PlayStation successful, and had a heavy focus on the early games on the console. Some of these absences were attributed to intellectual rights (for example, Activision holding the rights to Spyro the Dragon, Crash Bandicoot, and Tony Hawk's), but other omissions were considered odd and disappointing. The system sold poorly and within the month, its suggested retail price had dropped to . By April 2019, the price had dropped to , and CNET described the PlayStation classic as \\"arguably one of the top flops of 2018.\\" = PlayStation Vita = PS Vita Sony's second major handheld game console, the PlayStation Vita, was released in Japan in 2011 and in the West the following year. The successor to the PlayStation Portable, Sony's intent with the system was to blend the experience of big budget, dedicated video game platforms with the trend of mobile gaming. With a relatively low price, a robust launch title assortment, and a strong debut, analysts predicted the Vita would be a success. However, sales tanked shortly after release; for instance, during Christmas 2011, sales saw a 78% drop in Japan. By 2018, when Sony announced it would end physical game production for the system, the Vita had sold less than 15 million units. Hardware production for the Vita ended entirely in March 2019, and Sony does not plan to release a successor. GamesIndustry.biz attributed the Vita's failure to a number of factors, including competition from smartphones and Nintendo's rival 3DS platform, in addition to a general lack of support from Sony and other developers. = PSX (DVR) = Built upon the PlayStation 2, the PSX enhanced multimedia derivative was touted to bring convergence to the living room in 2003 by including non- gaming features such as a DVD recorder, TV tuner, and multi-use hard drive.\\"Sony adds Bells and Whistles to PlayStation 2\\" , San Francisco Gate, May 29, 2003 The device was considered a failure upon its Japanese release due to its high price and lack of consumer interest,\\"Next Gen Console Wars: Revenge of Kutaragi\\" , TeamXbox website, June 13, 2005 which resulted in the cancellation of plans to release it in the rest of the world. Not only was it an unsuccessful attempt by Sony Computer Entertainment head Ken Kutaragi to revive the ailing consumer electronics division,\\"Mr. Idei's Kurosawa Ending\\" , Robert X. Cringely, March 10, 2005 it also hurt Sony's media convergence plans. Rob Fahey, October 9, 2004 =Sega CD= The Sega CD attached to a Sega Genesis The Sega CD, known as the Mega-CD in Japan and Europe, was a CD-ROM accessory for the Sega Genesis released in Japan in late 1991, North America in late 1992, and in Europe in early 1993. The CD-ROM format sported a much larger storage capacity than traditional cartridges, allowing for a incorporation of full-motion video into games. Although heavily promoted, and having gained much publicity for the game Night Trap, which was one of the subjects of the 1993 congressional hearings on video games, the high price ($299 at launch) and slow release of games hurt the popularity of the accessory. By the time Sega discontinued the unit as part of the shift towards the Sega Saturn, the unit had sold only 2.24 million units worldwide, See lines 6 and 18 for units sold in Japan and other regions, respectively. with former Sega of Europe president Nick Alexander saying \\"The Mega CD was interesting but probably misconceived and was seen very much as the interim product it was... it was not a success.\\" = 32X = Sega 32X Unveiled by Sega at June 1994's Consumer Electronics Show, the 32X was later described as the \\"poor man's entry into 'next generation' games.\\" The product was originally conceived as an entirely new console by Sega Enterprises and positioned as an inexpensive alternative for gamers into the 32-bit era, but at the suggestion of Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Mega Drive/Genesis and made more powerful, with two 32-bit central processing unit chips and a 3D graphics processor. Nevertheless, the console failed to attract either developers or consumers as the Sega Saturn had already been announced for release the next year. In part because of this, and also to rush the 32X to market before the holiday season in 1994, the 32X suffered from a poor library of titles, including Mega Drive/Genesis ports with improvements to the number of colors that appeared on screen. Originally released at US$159, Sega dropped the price to $99 in only a few months and ultimately cleared the remaining inventory at $19.95. About 665,000 units were sold. = Genesis Nomad = The Nomad, a handheld game console by Sega released in North America in October 1995, is a portable variation of Sega's home console, the Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside of North America). Designed from the Mega Jet, a portable version of the home console designed for use on airline flights in Japan, Nomad served to succeed the Game Gear and was the last handheld console released by Sega. Released late in the Genesis era, the Nomad had a short lifespan. Sold exclusively in North America, the Nomad was never officially released worldwide, and employs regional lockout. The handheld itself was incompatible with several Genesis peripherals, including the Power Base Converter, the Sega CD, and the Sega 32X. The release was five years into the market span of the Genesis, with an existing library of more than 500 Genesis games. With the Nomad's late release several months after the launch of the Saturn, this handheld is said to have suffered from its poorly timed launch. Sega decided to stop focusing on the Genesis in 1999, several months before the release of the Dreamcast, by which time the Nomad was being sold at less than a third of its original price. Reception for the Nomad is mixed between its uniqueness and its poor timing into the market. Blake Snow of GamePro listed the Nomad as fifth on his list of the \\"10 Worst-Selling Handhelds of All Time,\\" criticizing its poor timing into the market, inadequate advertising, and poor battery life. = Sega Saturn = The North American model of the Sega Saturn console The Sega Saturn was the successor to the Genesis as a 32-bit fifth-generation console, released in Japan in November 1994 and in Western markets mid-1995. The console was designed as a competitor to Sony's PlayStation, released nearly at the same time. With the system selling well in Japan and Sega wanting to get a head start over the PlayStation in North America, the company decided to release the system in May instead of September 1995, which was the same time the PlayStation was going to be released in North America. This left little time to promote the product and limited quantities of the system available at retail. Sega's release strategy also backfired when, shortly after Sega's announcement, Sony announced the price of the PlayStation as being $100 less than the list price for the Saturn. The console also suffered from behind the scenes management conflicts and a lack of coordination between the Japanese and North American branches of the company, leading to the Saturn to be released shortly after the release of the 32X, which created distribution and retail problems. By the end of 1996, the PlayStation had sold 2.9 million units in the U.S., with only 1.2 million units sold by the Saturn. With the added competition from the subsequent release of the Nintendo 64, the Saturn lost market share in North America and was discontinued by 1999. With lifetime sales estimated at 9.5 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure. The cancellation of a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, known in development as Sonic X-treme, has been considered a significant factor in the console's struggle to find an audience. The impact of the failure of the Saturn carried over into Sega's next console, the Dreamcast. However, the console gained interest in Japan and was not officially discontinued until January 4, 2001. = uDraw GameTablet = The uDraw GameTablet is a graphics tablet developed by THQ for use on seventh generation video game consoles, which was initially released for the Wii in late 2010. Versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were released in late 2011. THQ also invested in several games that would uniquely use the tablet, such as uDraw Pictionary. The Wii version had positive sales, with more than 1.7 million units sold, prompting the introduction of the unit for the other console systems. These units did not share the same popularity; 2011 holiday sales in North America fell $100 million below company targets with more than 1.4 million units left unsold by February 2012. THQ commented that if they had not attempted to sell these versions of uDraw, the company would have been profitable that respective quarter, but instead suffered an overall $56 million loss. Because of this failure, THQ was forced to shelve some of its less-successful franchises, such as the Red Faction series. THQ would eventually file for bankruptcy and sell off its assets in early 2013. = Vectrex = Though its independent monitor could display only monochrome visuals, the console's vector-based graphics and arcade-style controller with analog joystick allowed developers to create a strong games library with faithful conversions of arcade hits and critically praised exclusives. However, its release shortly before the North American video game crash of 1983 doomed it to an early grave.Barton, Matt and Loguidice, Bill. (2007). A History of Gaming Platforms: The Vectrex , Gamasutra. = Virtual Boy = Mario's Tennis as displayed on a Virtual Boy emulator. The red/blue format simulates the Virtual Boy's 3D display. This red monochromatic 3-D \\"virtual reality\\" system was widely panned by critics and failed due to issues related to players getting eye strain, stiff necks, nausea, and headaches when playing it, along with the console's price and lack of portability. It came out in 1995 and was Nintendo's first failed console release. Gunpei Yokoi, the designer of the platform and the person largely credited for the success of the original Game Boy handheld and the Metroid series of games, resigned from the company shortly after the Virtual Boy ceased sales in order to start his own company, although for reasons unrelated to the console's success. The Virtual Boy was included in a Time \\"50 Worst Inventions\\" list published in May 2010. =Wii U= The Wii U with the main console hardware and the GamePad with an embedded touchscreen Nintendo's Wii U was released in November 2012. It was designed as successor to the Wii to provide a more sophisticated experience and draw back \\"core\\" gamers that had dismissed the Wii, which they found was aimed for casual gameplay. The Wii U features the GamePad, the unit's primary controller with a touchscreen allowing for dual-screen play similar to the Nintendo DS line, or can be used for off-TV play. Though the Wii U received positive coverage, it had low sales of fewer than 14 million units by the end of 2016 compared to the Wii's lifetime of 101 million units. Nintendo executives attributed the poor sales of the Wii U to a combination of factors. They admitted their messaging of the Wii U's abilities had not been clear, leading to a general perception that the unit was primarily a tablet system or an add-on to the original Wii rather than a new home console. They also recognized a failure to manage their game release schedule, and to garner significant support from third-party publishers and developers, leaving the Wii U library with gaps in software releases. Nintendo stated an expectation to sell 100 million Wii U units, and this over-estimation of sales contributed to several financial quarters of losses through 2016. The development and marketing of Nintendo's next console, the Switch, was intended to avoid several of the pitfalls that occurred for the Wii U; with the change in approach, the Switch outsold the lifetime sales of the Wii U within nine months of its release. The Wii U was discontinued on January 31, 2017.  Video game software failures  The following is an incomplete list of software that have been deemed commercial failures by industry sources. = APB: All Points Bulletin = APB: All Points Bulletin was a multiplayer online game developed by Realtime Worlds in 2010. The game, incorporating concepts from their previous game Crackdown and past work by its lead developer David Jones, who had helped create the Grand Theft Auto series, was set around the idea of a large-scale urban battle between Enforcers and Criminals; players would be able to partake in large-scale on-going missions between the two sides. The game was originally set as both a Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 title and as Realtime Worlds' flagship title for release in 2008, but instead the company set about developing Crackdown first, and later focused APB as a Windows-only title, potentially porting the game to the Xbox 360 later. Upon launch in June 2010, the game received lukewarm reviews, hampered by the existence of a week-long review embargo, and did not attract the expected number of subscribers to maintain its business model. Realtime Worlds, suffering from the commercial failure of the game, sold off a second project, Project MyWorld, and subsequently reduced its operations to administration and a skeleton crew to manage the APB servers while they attempted to find a buyer, including possibly Epic Games who had expressed interest in the title. However, without any acceptable offers, the company was forced to shut down APB in September 2010. Eventually, the game was sold to K2 Network, a company that has brought other Asian massive-multiplayer online games to the Western markets as free-to-play titles, and similar changes occurred to APB when it was relaunched by K2. = Battlecruiser 3000AD = One of the most notorious PC video game failures, Battlecruiser 3000AD (shortened BC3K) was hyped for almost a decade before its disastrous release in the U.S. and Europe. The game was the brainchild of Derek Smart, an independent game developer renowned for lengthy and aggressive online responses to perceived criticism. The concept behind BC3K was ambitious, giving the player the command of a large starship with all the requisite duties, including navigation, combat, resource management, and commanding crew members. Advertisements appeared in the video game press in the mid-1990s hyping the game as, \\"The Last Thing You'll Ever Desire.\\" Computer bulletin boards and Usenet groups were abuzz with discussion about the game. As time wore on and numerous delays were announced, excitement turned to frustration in the online community. Smart exacerbated the negative air by posting liberally on Usenet. The posts ignited one of the largest flame wars in Usenet history. During the development cycle, Smart refused to let other programmers have full access to his code and continued to change directions as new technology became available, causing the game to be in development for over seven years. In November 1996, Take-Two Interactive finally released the game, reportedly over protests from Smart. The game was buggy and only partially finished, with outdated graphics, MIDI music, a cryptic interface, and almost no documentation. Critics and the video game community reacted poorly to the release. Eventually, a stable, playable version of the game was released as Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0. Smart eventually released BC3K as freeware and went on to create several sequels under the Battlecruiser and Universal Combat titles. = Beyond Good & Evil = Although critically acclaimed and planned as the first part of a trilogy, Beyond Good & Evil (released in 2003) flopped commercially. Former Ubisoft employee Owen Hughes stated that it was felt that the simultaneous releases of internationally competing titles Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and in Europe, XIII (all three published by Ubisoft and all of which had strong brand identity in their markets), made an impact on Beyond Good & Evils ability to achieve interest with the public. The game's commercial failure led Ubisoft to postpone plans for any subsequent titles in the series. A sequel was announced at the end of the Ubidays 2008 opening conference, and an HD version of the original was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 via download in 2011. Alain Corre, Ubisoft's Executive Director of EMEA Territories, commented that the Xbox 360 release \\"did extremely well\\", but considered this success \\"too late\\" to make a difference in the game's poor sales. Beyond Good & Evil 2 was announced at Ubisoft's press conference at E3 2017, fourteen years after the release of the original game. = Brütal Legend = Brütal Legend is Double Fine Productions' second major game. The game is set in a world based on heavy metal music, includes a hundred-song soundtrack across numerous metal subgenres, and incorporates a celebrity voice cast including Jack Black, Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Ozzy Osbourne, Lita Ford, and Tim Curry. The game was originally to be published by Vivendi Games via Sierra Entertainment prior to its merger with Activision. Following the merger, Activision declined to publish Brütal Legend, and Double Fine turned to Electronic Arts as their publishing partner, delaying the game's release. Activision and Double Fine counter-sued each other for breach of contract, ultimately settling out of court. The game was designed as an action adventure/real-time strategy game similar to Herzog Zwei; as games in the real-time strategy genre generally do not perform well on consoles, Double Fine was told by both Vivendi and Electronic Arts to avoid stating this fact and emphasize other elements of the game. With some positive reviews from critics, the game got criticized for its real-time strategy elements that were not mentioned within the pre-release marketing, making it a difficult game to sell to players. Furthermore, its late-year release in October 2009 buried the title among many top-tier games, including Uncharted 2, Batman: Arkham Asylum and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. It only sold about 215,000 units within the first month, making it a \\"retail failure\\", and though Double Fine had begun work on a sequel, Electronic Arts cancelled further development. According to Tim Schafer, president and lead developer of Double Fine, 1.4 million copies of the game had been sold by February 2011. = Conker's Bad Fur Day = Conker's Bad Fur Day is a 3D platformer by Rare for the Nintendo 64. In it, the player controls Conker, a greedy, hard- drinking squirrel, through levels. While it is visually similar to Rare's previous games like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day is aimed at mature audiences and features profanity, graphic violence, and off- color humor. The game was originally designed to be family-friendly, but was retooled after prerelease versions of the game were criticized for their similarities to Rare's previous games. Though receiving critical acclaim, Conker's Bad Fur Day performed well below expectations, with only 55,000 copies sold by April 2001. Numerous reasons have been cited for the game's perceived failure to connect with audiences, such as its high cost, advertisements exclusive to the older audience, and its release towards the end of the Nintendo 64's life cycle. Nintendo, which held a minority stake in Rare at the time, also did not actively promote the game. = Daikatana = One of the more infamous failures in modern PC video games was Daikatana, which was drastically hyped due to creator John Romero's popular status as one of the key designers behind Doom. However, after being wrought with massive over-spending and serious delays, the game finally launched to incredibly poor critical reaction because of bugs, lackluster enemies, poor gameplay, and terrible production values, all of which were made worse by its heavy marketing campaign proclaiming it as the next \\"big thing\\" in first person shooters. = Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3 = The first title released by Ion Storm, Dominion was a real time strategy title similar to Command & Conquer and Warcraft, based as a spin-off to the G-Nome canon. The game was originally developed by 7th Level, but was purchased by Ion Storm for US$1.8 million. The project originally had a budget of US$50,000 and was scheduled to be finished in three months with two staff members. Due to mismanagement and Ion Storm's inexperience, the project took over a year, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. The 25 Dumbest Moments in Video Game History , GameSpy, June 2003 Dominion was released in July 1998. It received bad reviews and sold poorly, falling far short of recouping its purchase price, let alone the cost of finishing it. The game divided employees working on Ion's marquee title, Daikatana, arguably leading to the walkout of several key development team members. It put a strain on Ion Storm's finances, leading the once well-funded startup to scramble for cash as Daikatana's development extended over several years. = Duke Nukem Forever = Duke Nukem Forever was an entry in the successful Duke Nukem series, initially announced in 1997, but spent fifteen years in development, and was frequently listed as a piece of vaporware video game software. The initial development with the Quake II Engine began in 1996, and the final game was developed by Gearbox Software, developers of the Borderlands series, and released in 2011. The game was heavily criticized and was named by several sites as their \\"most disappointing\\" game for the year. Because of its tangled development process, it is very hard to know which companies made and which lost money over the game. According to Gearbox head Randy Pitchford, the game cost 3D Realms head George Broussard US$20–30 million of his own money. The sales were poorer than expected, causing Take- Two to reduce their profit estimate for the quarter, though later in 2011 stated that Duke Nukem Forever would prove to be profitable for the company. = EarthBound = EarthBound (1994), the second installment in Nintendo's Mother series of Japanese role-playing games, was released in North America in June 1995. Although Nintendo spent a sizable 2 million on marketing, it sold poorly—around 140,000 copies, as compared to twice as many in Japan. Journalists generally blame EarthBound failure to connect with American audiences on its atypical marketing campaign, which sardonically proclaimed \\"this game stinks\\" in reference to foul-smelling scratch and sniff advertisements. The game's poor sales have also been attributed to its simple, cartoonish graphics, the unpopularity of role-playing games at the time, and its high market price. Marcus Lindblom and his team, who translated EarthBound for America, were devastated by the poor sales. As a result, EarthBound sequel Mother 3 (2006) never received an American localization on the basis it would not sell. =Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two= A sequel to the successful Wii-exclusive platformer Epic Mickey, Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two was developed by Junction Point Studios and published by Disney Interactive Studios for the Wii, Wii U, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Microsoft Windows. Though heavily advertised and being released on multiple consoles, only 270,000 copies of Epic Mickey 2 were sold in North America, barely a quarter of the original's sales of 1.3 million. The game's failure led to the shutdown of Junction Point and the cancellation of future entries in the Epic Mickey series. = E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial = Excavated copies of E.T., Centipede, and other Atari games from the burial site in New Mexico Based on Steven Spielberg's popular 1982 movie of the same name and reportedly coded in just five weeks, this Atari 2600 game was rushed to the market for the 1982 holiday season. Even with 1.5 million copies sold, the sales figures came nowhere near Atari's expectations, as it had ordered production of five million copies, with many of the sold games being returned to Atari for refunds by dissatisfied consumers. It had become an urban legend that Atari had buried the unsold cartridges of E.T. and other games in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico, which was confirmed in 2014 when the site was allowed to be excavated, with former Atari personnel affirming they had dumped about 800,000 cartridges, including E.T. and other poorly-selling (and best-selling) games. The financial figures and business tactics surrounding this product are emblematic of the video game crash of 1983 and contributed to Atari's bankruptcy. Atari paid $25 million for the license to produce the game, which further contributed to a debt of $536 million (equivalent to $ billion today). The company was divided and sold in 1984. = Grim Fandango = Known for being the first adventure game by LucasArts to use three-dimensional graphics, Grim Fandango received positive reviews and won numerous awards. It was originally thought that the game sold well during the 1998 holiday season. However, the game's sales appeared to be crowded out by other titles released during the late 1998 season, including Half-Life, Metal Gear Solid and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Based on data provided by PC Data (now owned by NPD Group), the game sold about 95,000 copies up to 2003 in North America, excluding online sales. Worldwide sales are estimated between 100,000 and 500,000 units by 2012. Developer Tim Schafer along with others of the Grim Fandango development team would leave LucasArts after this project to begin a new studio (Double Fine Productions). Grim Fandangos relatively modest sales are often cited as a contributing factor to the decline of the adventure game genre in the late 1990s, though the title's reputation as a \\"flop\\" is to an extent a case of perception over reality, as Schafer has pointed out that the game turned a profit, with the royalty check he eventually received being proof. His perspective is that the adventure genre did not so much lose its audience as fail to grow it while production costs continued to rise. This made adventure games less attractive an investment for publishers; in contrast, the success of first-person shooters caused the console market to boom. The emergence of new distribution channels that did not rely on the traditional retail model would ultimately re-empower the niche genre. Double Fine has since remastered the game for high definition graphics and re- released it through these channels. = Jazz Jackrabbit 2 = Although reviews for Jazz Jackrabbit 2 were positive, sales were insufficient and resulted in a loss for its publisher Gathering of Developers. This prevented the developers from finding a publisher, thus leading to the cancelation of Jazz Jackrabbit 3 which could have been the franchise's first 3D game. = Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning = Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is an action RPG game released in 2012, developed by 38 Studios and Big Huge Games. 38 Studios had been formed by Curt Schilling initially in Massachusetts. After acquiring Big Huge Games from the failing THQ, the studio secured a loan guarantee from the economic development board of Rhode Island for establishing 38 Studios within the state and promoting job growth. Kingdoms was generally well-received by critics, and initial sales within the first three months were around 1.3 million. Though impressive, Rhode Island recognized that the title was expected to have hit 3 million units by this point for 38 Studios to pay back the loan. 38 Studios defaulted on one of the loan repayments, leading to a publisher to pull out of a investment in a sequel. The studio managed to make the next payment, but could not make payroll or other expenses, and shortly later declared bankruptcy by May 2012. Resolving the unpaid loan became a civil lawsuit, and ultimately with the state settling with Schilling and other investors for a payment, leaving the state around short on its loan. The rights to Kingdoms eventually fell to THQ Nordic AB, the holding company that came to acquire many of the former THQ properties after their bankruptcy. = The Last Express = Released in 1997 after five years in development, this $6 million adventure game was the brainchild of Jordan Mechner, the creator of Prince of Persia. The game was noted for taking place in almost complete real-time, using Art Nouveau-style characters that were rotoscoped from a 22-day live- action video shoot, and featuring intelligent writing and levels of character depth that were not often seen in computer games. Even with rave reviews, Brøderbund, the game's publisher, did little to promote the game, apart from a brief mention in a press release and enthusiastic statements by Brøderbund executives, in part due to the entire Brøderbund marketing team quitting in the weeks before its release. Released in April, the game was not a success, selling only about 100,000 copies, a million copies short of breaking even. After the release of the game, Mechner's company Smoking Car Productions quietly folded, and Brøderbund was acquired by The Learning Company, who were only interested in Brøderbund's educational software, effectively putting the game out of print which also caused the PlayStation port to be cancelled after almost being finished for a 1998 release. Mechner was later able to reacquire the rights to the game, and in 2012, worked with DotEmu to release an iOS port of the title, before making it to Android as well. = MadWorld = MadWorld is a beat 'em up title for the Wii developed by PlatinumGames and distributed by Sega in March 2009. The game was purposely designed as an extremely violent video game. The game features a distinctive black-and-white graphic style that borrows from both Frank Miller's Sin City and other Japanese and Western comics. This monotone coloring is only broken by blood that comes from attacking and killing foes in numerous, gruesome, and over-the-top manners. Though there had been violent games available for the Wii from the day it was launched (e.g. Red Steel), many perceived MadWorld as one of the first mature titles for the system, causing some initial outrage from concerned consumers about the normally family-friendly system. MadWorld was well received by critics, but this did not translate into commercial sales; only 123,000 units of the game sold in the United States during its first six months on the market. Sega considered these sales to be \\"disappointing\\". Regardless, the game's critical success allowed a pseudo-sequel, Anarchy Reigns, to be produced. = Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite = Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite is the sixth main installment in Capcom's Marvel vs. Capcom series of fighting games that pits Capcom and Marvel's famous characters against each other. When the game was shown at E3 2017, some of the character designs were poorly received, particularly Chun-Li from Street Fighter and Dante from Devil May Cry. The game was also criticized for its lack of X-Men or Fantastic Four characters. Capcom projected that the game would sell two million units by December 31, 2017, but the game launched with a poor showing thanks to the game having a low-budget, which would cause Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite to generate only half of the projected amount that Capcom gave. Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinites failing would lead to cancellation of DLC, and its exclusion from tournaments such as Evo 2018, as well as Capcom being quiet surrounding the title. The title's failure was also in part due to the competition it received from Bandai Namco's Dragon Ball FighterZ which along with its massive name recognition, took influence from Infinite's two predecessors. = Ōkami = Ōkami was a product of Clover Studio with direction by Hideki Kamiya, previously known for his work on the Resident Evil and Devil May Cry series. The game is favorably compared to a Zelda-type adventure, and is based on the quest of the goddess-wolf Amaterasu using a \\"celestial brush\\" to draw in magical effects on screen and to restore the cursed land of ancient Nippon. Released first in 2006 on the PlayStation 2, it later received a port to the Wii system, where the brush controls were reworked for the motion controls of the Wii Remote. The game was well received by critics, with Metacritic aggregate scores of 93% and 90% for the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, respectively, and was considered one of the best titles for 2006; IGN named it their Game of the Year. Though strongly praised by critics, fewer than 600,000 units were sold by March 2009. These factors have led for Ōkami to be called the \\"least commercially successful winner of a game of the year award\\" in the 2010 version of the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition. Shortly after its release, Capcom disbanded Clover Studio, though many of its employees went on to form PlatinumGames and produce MadWorld and the more successful Bayonetta. Strong fan support of the game led to a sequel, Ōkamiden, on the Nintendo DS, a high-definition remake for the PlayStation 3, and a remaster for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows. = Overkill's The Walking Dead = Starbreeze Studios had acquired a license in 2014 to develop a game set in The Walking Dead franchise from Skybound Entertainment, using the cooperative gameplay mechanics from Payday: The Heist developed by Starbreeze's subsidiary Overkill Software. The game fell into development hell namely due to demands from Starbreeze to switch game engines, first from the internally-developed Diesel Engine which had been used on the Payday games to the newly developed Valhalla Engine, which Starbreeze had acquired at a large cost, and later to the Unreal Engine after the Valhalla proved too difficult to work with. Having slipped its major release dates twice, the game was completed by November 2018, but which the developers felt was under extreme rush and without sufficient quality review and testing. Overkill's The Walking Dead had mediocre reviews on release to Microsoft Windows, and only 100,000 units were sold within the month. Starbreeze had placed a significant amount of sales expectations behind the game, and with poor sales, the company placed plans to release the game on consoles on hold, and in December 2018 announced that it was restructuring due to a lack of liquidatable assets from the underperformance of Overkill's The Walking Dead. In Starbreeze's financial report for the quarter ending December 31, 2018, which included Overkill's The Walking Dead release, the game brought in only about (about ), while Payday 2, a title released in 2013, made in the same quarter. By the end of February 2019, Skybound pulled its licensing agreement from Starbreeze as \\"ultimately 'Overkill's The Walking Dead' did not meet our standards nor is it the quality that we were promised\\". Starbreeze officially halted further development of the Windows version and cancelled the game's planned console ports, while Skybound later cancelled the game entirely and pulled the license from Starbreeze. The poor returns on OTWD led Starbreeze to undergo a corporate restructuring from December 2018 to December 2019, laying off staff, selling off publishing and intellectual property rights, and reimplemented paid downloadable content for Payday 2, reneging on an early promise that all such future content would be free. = Psychonauts = Though achieving notable critical success, including GameSpot's 2005 Best Game No One Played award,\\"Gamespot: Best of 2005 Special Achievement\\" , GameSpot Psychonauts sold fewer than 100,000 copies during its initial release., The Escapist, 13 November 2007 The game led to troubles at publisher Majesco Entertainment, including the resignation of its CEO and the plummeting of the company's stock,\\"Majesco stock plummets as CEO quits\\", GameSpot Xbox, July 12, 2005 prompting a class-action lawsuit by the company's stockholders.\\"Stockholders sue Majesco en masse\\", GameSpot Xbox, July 19, 2005 At the time of its release in 2005, the game was considered the \\"poster child\\" for failures in innovative games.\\"Bitter medicine: What does the game industry have against innovation?\\" , GameSpot Xbox, December 20, 2005 Its poor sales have also been blamed on a lack of marketing. However, today the game remains a popular title on various digital download services. The creator of Psychonauts, Tim Schafer, has a cult following due to his unique and eccentric style. Eventually, Double Fine would go on to acquire the full rights to publishing the game, and, with funding from Dracogen, created a Mac OS X and Linux port of the game, which was sold as part of a Humble Bundle in 2012 with nearly 600,000 bundles sold; according to Schafer, \\"We made more on Psychonauts [in 2012] than we ever have before.\\" In August 2015, Steam Spy estimated approximately 1,157,000 owners of the game on the digital distributor Steam.Psychonauts on Steamspy.com (2015-08-13) Psychonauts was re-released in 2019 for the Playstation 4 as a Standard Edition and a Collector's Edition, both region free, by publishing company Limited Run Games. = Shenmue and Shenmue II = Shenmue on the Dreamcast is more notorious for its overambitious budget than its poor sales figures. At the time of release in 1999, the game had the record for the most expensive production costs (over US$70 million), and its five-year production time. In comparison, the games' total sale was 1.2 million copies. Shenmue, however, was a critical hit, earning an average review score of 89%. on GameRankings The game was supposed to be the initial installment of a trilogy. The second installment was eventually released in 2001, but by this time the Dreamcast was floundering, so the game only saw a release in Japan and Europe. Sega eventually released it for North American players for the Xbox, but the poor performance of both titles combined with restructuring have made Sega reluctant to complete the trilogy for fear of failure to return on the investment. However, a Kickstarter campaign has received record support for a third title, with a release originally set for 2018, was eventually released on November 19, 2019. Ports of the first two titles were released in 2018 for PC and PlayStation 4 to re-acclimate players in preparation for the third title's release. = Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal = Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric is a spin-off from the Sonic the Hedgehog series, released in 2014 and developed by Big Red Button Entertainment and IllFonic for Sega and Sonic Team, along with its handheld counterpart Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal, which was developed by Sanzaru Games. Although both games received a negative reception, Rise of Lyric for the Wii U is particularly considered one of the worst video games of all time due to many glitches, poor gameplay and weak writing. Both games failed commercially, selling only 490,000 copies as of February 2015, making them the lowest-selling games in the Sonic franchise. = Sonic Runners = Sonic Runners was a Sonic the Hedgehog game for Android and iOS. A side-scrolling endless runner, it was Sonic Team's first Sonic game that was exclusive to smartphones. It was soft launched in select regions in February 2015 and officially released worldwide in June 2015 to mixed reviews. Although it was downloaded over five million times, the game's publisher, Sega, considered it a commercial failure because it only made between ¥30–50 million a month. As a result, it was discontinued in July 2016. Nintendo Life wrote its failure was proof that the recognizability of a brand does not guarantee success. = Sunset = Sunset, a first-person exploration adventure game involving a housekeeper working for a dictator of a fictional country, was developed by two-person Belgian studio Tale of Tales, who previously had created several acclaimed arthouse style games and other audio-visual projects such as The Path. They wanted to make Sunset a \\"game for gamers\\" while still retaining their arthouse-style approach, and in addition to planning on a commercial release, used Kickstarter to gain funding. Sunset only sold about 4000 copies on its release, including those to Kickstarter backers. Tale of Tales opted to close their studio after sinking the company's finances into the game, and believed that if they did release any new games in the future, they would likely shy away from commercial release. = Uru: Ages Beyond Myst = The fourth game in the popular Myst series, released in 2003. It was developed by Cyan Worlds shortly after Riven was completed. The game took Cyan Worlds more than five years and $12 million to complete and was codenamed DIRT (\\"D'ni in real time\\"), then MUDPIE (meaning \\"Multi-User DIRT, Persistent / Personal Interactive Entertainment / Experience / Exploration / Environment\\"). Though it had generally positive reception, the sales were disappointing. In comparison, the first three Myst games had sold more than 12 million units collectively before Urus release. Urus poor sales were also considered a factor in financially burdening Cyan, contributing to the company's near closure in 2005.  Arcade game failures  I, Robot = Released by Atari in 1983, I, Robot was the first video game to use 3-D polygon graphics, and the first that allowed the player to change camera angles. It also had gameplay that rewarded planning and stealth as much as reflexes and trigger speed, and included a non-game mode called \\"Doodle City,\\" where players could make artwork using the polygons. Production estimates vary, but all agree that there were no more than 1500 units made. = Jack the Giantkiller = In 1982, the President of Cinematronics arranged a one-time purchase of 5000 printed circuit boards from Japan. The boards were used in the manufacture of several games, but the majority of them were reserved for the new arcade game Jack the Giantkiller, based on the classic fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk. Between the purchase price of the boards and other expenses, Cinematronics invested almost two million dollars into Jack the Giantkiller. It completely flopped in the arcade and many of the boards went unsold, costing the company a huge amount of money at a time when it was already having financial difficulties. Jack and the 'Company' Killer = Radar Scope = Radar Scope was one of the first arcade games released by Nintendo. It was released in Japan first, and a brief run of success there led Nintendo to order 3,000 units for the American market in 1980. American operators were unimpressed, however, and Nintendo of America was stuck with about 2,000 unsold Radar Scope machines sitting in the warehouse. Radar Scope @ Everything2.com Facing a potential financial disaster, Nintendo assigned the game's designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, to revamp the game. Instead he designed a brand new game that could be run in the same cabinets and on the same hardware as Radar Scope. GameSpot: The History of Nintendo That new game was the smash hit Donkey Kong, and Nintendo was able to recoup its investment in 1981 by converting the remaining unsold Radar Scope units to Donkey Kong and selling those. = Sundance = Sundance was an arcade vector game released in 1979. Producer Cinematronics planned to manufacture about 1000 Sundance units, but sales suffered from a combination of poor gameplay and an abnormally high rate of manufacturing defects. The fallout rate in production was about 50%, the vector monitor (made by an outside vendor) had a defective picture tube that would arc and burn out if the game was left in certain positions during shipping, and according to programmer Tim Skelly, the circuit boards required a lot of cut-and-jumpering between mother and daughter boards that also made for a very fragile setup. The units that survived to reach arcade floors were not a hit with gamers—Skelly himself reportedly felt that the gameplay lacked the \\"anxiety element\\" necessary in a good game and asked Cinematronics not to release it, and in an April 1983 interview with Video Games Magazine he referred to Sundance as \\"a total dog\\".interview with Tim Skelly Video Games magazine  See also  * List of video games notable for negative reception * List of best-selling video games * List of films considered the worst * List of television series considered the worst * List of video games considered the best  References  External links  * The Dumbest 25 moments in gaming from GameSpy * The Silicon Valley 10 & 1 06.16.10: Top 10 Console Failures!

Michael B. Wolfe (born 3 April 1945) is an American poet, author, and the President and Co-Executive Producer of Unity Productions Foundation. A secular American born in Cincinnati, Ohio to a Christian mother and a Jewish father, Wolfe converted to Islam at 40 and has been a frequent lecturer on Islamic issues at universities across the United States including Harvard, Georgetown, Stanford, SUNY Buffalo, and Princeton. He holds a degree in Classics from Wesleyan University. Teaching career Wolfe taught writing and English at Phillips Exeter and Phillips Andover academies, the California State Summer School for the Arts, and the University of California, Santa Cruz. Tombouctou Books For fifteen years, Wolfe was sole publisher of Tombouctou Books, a small press enterprise located in Bolinas, California, that issued small editions of poetry and avant garde prose, including The Basketball Diaries by Jim Carroll, two books of fiction by the Moroccan storyteller Mohammed Mrabet; American fiction by Douglas Woolf, Dale Herd, Lucia Berlin, Bobbie Louise Hawkins, Steve Emerson, and Paul Bowles's final collection of short stories, Unwelcome Words: Seven Stories.; The Japan and India Journals by Joanne Kyger; and volumes of poetry by Tom Clark, Lewis MacAdams, Leslie Scalapino, and Duncan McNaughton. Writing career Wolfe was a participant at Bread Loaf Writers Conference in 1960 as a 16-year-old. As an undergraduate at Wesleyan University, he studied poetry with Richard Wilbur, 1964-68, and was in a writing circle with Keith and Rosmarie Waldrop. He returned to Bread Loaf for a second summer in 1966. Wolfe was a MacDowell Colony resident in poetry in 1968. He received an Amy Lowell Traveling Poets Scholarship in 1970, which was renewed for two further years. During this time he traveled and wrote in North and West Africa. His first books of poetry How Love Gets Around and World Your Own, a book of fiction Invisible Weapons, and a travel journal In Morocco derive from this period. In the 1980s, he returned to North Africa several more times. As a Muslim he performed the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1990 and wrote extensively about it. Wolfe's first works on Islam were a pair of books from Grove Press on the pilgrimage to Mecca: The Hadj (1993; 2015), a first-person travel account, and One Thousand Roads to Mecca (1997; updated & expanded, 2015), an anthology of 10 centuries of travelers writing about the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. Shortly after 11 September 2001, he edited a collection of essays by American Muslims and others called Taking Back Islam: American Muslims Reclaim Their Faith. Taking Back Islam won the 2003 annual Wilbur Award for \\"Best Book of the year on a Religious Theme\\". In 2010, Wolfe was included in \\"The 500 Most Influential Muslims,\\" (Third Edition). In 2010, Blue Press Books published a chapbook of poems by Wolfe entitled Paradise: Reading Notes. In 2012, Blue Press published a second chapbook, entitled \\"Greek to Me.\\" In 2014, Blue Press issued a third chapbook, \\"Tarantella.\\" In 2014, he also assembled a fourth, longer volume of poetry, entitled Digging Up Russia: Selected Poems, 1968-2010. Between 2008 and 2012, Wolfe translated a collection of 127 epitaphs from the Greek Anthology, entitled Cut These Words into My Stone: Selected Ancient Greek Epitaphs. This collection with a set of brief contextualizing essays was published by Johns Hopkins University Press in 2013, with an Introduction by Professor Richard P. Martin, Chair of the Stanford University Classics Department. The book was well received in classical journals and among poets. It was short-listed for PEN's Best Book of Poetry in Translation. In 2014 Wolfe completed a brief, first-person novel, entitled \\"The Motorbike,\\" set in Cincinnati in 1958. In 2017, he began researching and writing a nonfiction book, \\"My Mother's People,\\" about his colonial Yankee ancestry and modern American immigration. For about four years, Wolfe wrote an occasional column for Beliefnet, a Web journal of the world’s religions. Television and film In April 1997, Wolfe hosted a televised account of the Hajj, broadcast from Mecca for Ted Koppel's Nightline on ABC. The program was nominated for Peabody, Emmy, George Polk, and National Press Club Awards. It won the annual Media Award from the Muslim Public Affairs Council. In February 2003, Wolfe worked with CNN International television news reporter Zain Verjee to produce a new half-hour documentary on the Hajj. Wolfe has been featured on hundreds of regional and national radio talk shows. In 1999, Wolfe helped found an educational media foundation focused on promoting peace through the media, Unity Productions Foundation (UPF). In 2002, UPF produced its first full-length film, called Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet, a two-hour television documentary on the life and times of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The film, which Wolfe co-created and co- produced, received a national broadcast on PBS and subsequent international broadcasts on National Geographic International. It was awarded a Cine Special Jury Award for Best Professional Documentary in its category of People and Places. Wolfe co-produced two new films released in 2007. The first was entitled Cities of Light: The Rise and Fall of Islamic Spain. It was aired nationally on PBS on Aug. 22, 2007. Prince Among Slaves was also aired on PBS that year. It is the true story of an African prince enslaved in antebellum Mississippi struggling to regain his freedom. UPF has since released six more contemporary documentaries. On a Wing and A Prayer (2008) and Talking through Walls (2009) both appeared on PBS. The third film, Allah Made Me Funny (2008), was released in theaters. In 2009, UPF's seventh film appeared on PBS. Based on a worldwide Gallup Poll of the Muslim world, it is called Inside Islam: What a Billion Muslims Really Think. Islamic Art: Mirror of the Invisible World, narrated by Susan Sarandon (2012) and Enemy of the Reich, narrated by Helen Mirren (2014), have followed. \\"The Sultan & the Saint,\\" the story of St. Francis of Assisi and his journey to the Crusades, appeared on PBS at Christmastime, 2017. Narrated by Jeremy Irons, it was nominated for UPF's first Emmy Award. In 2018, the UPF Team began pre-production on its first animated feature film, \\"Lamya's Poem.\\" All UPF films have websites and are additionally available through UPF's educational outreach project, called 20,000 Dialogues. Wolfe continues to produce long and short-form documentaries for PBS and other broadcasters in the US and abroad with Unity Productions Foundation.

Special education In December 2010, the district administration reported that 1,852 pupils or 14.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 51% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 1,856 pupils or 15% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The School District received a $6,800,755 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–12 and 2012–13 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010–11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 In 2009, Upper Darby School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008–09. The district received an alert letter from the PDE - Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The district was placed in Tier 2 due to students spending more than 60% of the school day, outside of regular education. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. In 2010, the district was assigned to the Tier 1 monitoring list, due to students spending less than 40% of their day in a regular education classroom. The district received a letter of “Warning” letter from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Tier 1 districts received on-site LRE monitoring in spring 2010. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 166 or 1.33% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. School safety and bullying Upper Darby School District Administration reported there were five incidents of bullying in the district in 2009. Seventy school safety incidents resulted in police intervention with 40 arrests. There were 27 incidents of sexual harassment and 84 assaults on students. In 2011, a video tape of an assault of a 13-year-old student by 7 Upper Darby High School students was widely reported. The video became a national symbol of school bullying. In October 2011, the District announced establishing a School Safety Committee to address the school's serious safety issues.Reilly, Linda, Members of Upper Darby School Safety Committee announced, October 28, 2011 The Upper Darby School Board has provided the district's antibully cyberbullying policy online.Upper Darby School Board, Bullying Cyber Bullying Policy 249, August 10, 2010 All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct beginning in 2006. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Wellness policy Upper Darby School Board established a district wellness policy in 2010.School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, 2010 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. e The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. At Upper Darby School District nutrition education is provided within the sequential, comprehensive health education program, in accordance with State Board of Education curriculum regulations and the academic standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, and Family and Consumer Sciences mandated by the Commonwealth. Additionally, foods provided through the National School Lunch or School Breakfast Programs are required to comply with federal nutrition standards under the School Meals Initiative.

The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others.

Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. =School Improvement Grant= In the summer of 2011, the district administration applied for School Improvement Grant funding, from the federal government (over $9.9 million available). The Bywood Elementary school, Charles Kelly Elementary were eligible for funding due to chronic low achievement. The District received $112,360. The grant stipulates the funds be used for improving student achievement using one of four federally dictated strategies. The strategies are: transformation, turnaround, restart with new faculty and administration or closure of failing schools. The Pennsylvania Education Secretary awarded $66 million to reform Pennsylvania's lowest-achieving schools in August 2011. The funding is for three years. For the 2009–10 school year, Upper Darby School District administration applied for a School Improvement Grant. It was eligible for funding due to the chronic, low achievement at the Upper Darby Senior High School, at Kelly Elementary and at Bywood Elementary. The District received $102,640. In 2010, Pennsylvania received $141 million from the federal –US Department of Education, to turn around its worst-performing schools. The funds were disbursed via a competitive grant program. The Pennsylvania Department of Education has identified 200 Pennsylvania schools as \\"persistently lowest- achieving,\\" making them eligible for this special funding. Pennsylvania required low performing schools to apply or provide documentation about why they had not applied. The funds must be used, by the district, to turn around schools in one of four ways: school closure, restart - close the school and reopen it as a charter school. The other two options involve firing the principal. One would require at least half the faculty in a chronically poor performing school be dismissed. The second involves intensive teacher training coupled with strong curriculum revision or a longer school day. Race to the Top grant District officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Due to very low student achievement the district was identified as a turnaround district making it eligible for an additional $750 per child in the district. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. 21st Century learning grant In July 2012, Upper Darby School District did not apply for a federal grant which is run by the PDE.

The grant was competitive. Applications for the grants were reviewed and scored by a panel of representatives from the educational field and professional grant writers. The school received $114,061. While 101 entities applied for the funding, only 66 were approved, including eight charter schools. The funding is for the 2012–13 fiscal year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Education Secretary Announces $19.78 Million Awarded to Enhance Academic Opportunities for At-Risk Students, July 11, 2012 =Common Cents state initiative= The Upper Darby School Board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2012–13 were set by the school board at 32.84 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011–12 - 31.7300 mills. *2010–11 - 30.9000 mills *2009–10 - 29.7200 mills. *2008–09 - 28.7400 mills. *2007–08 - 27.7700 mills. *2006–07 - 26.5500 mills. *2005–06 - 25.2300 mills. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011–2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for the School District 2006–2007 through 2011–2012. *2006–07 - 5.3%, Base 3.9% *2007–08 - 4.6%, Base 3.4% *2008–09 - 6.0%, Base 4.4% *2009–10 - 5.6%, Base 4.1% *2010–11 - 4.0%, Base 2.9% *2011–12 - 1.9%, Base 1.4% *2012–13 - 2.3%, Base 1.7%Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012–2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012 For the 2012–13 budget year, Upper Darby School Board applied for 2 exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: special education costs and teacher pension costs. For 2012–2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012–2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011–12 school year, the Upper Darby School Board applied for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index, including Maintenance of Local Tax Revenue, teacher pension costs and special education costs. Each year, the Upper Darby School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011–2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Upper Darby School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. For 2009–10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2012, Upper Darby School District approved homestead residents received $313. In 2010, property tax relief for 16,571 approved residents of Upper Darby School District was set at $310.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per Homestead, May 1, 2010 The highest property tax relief, among Pennsylvania school districts, went to the homesteads of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead in 2010. Chester-Upland School District has consistently been the top recipient since the programs inception.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, May 1, 2009 The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Delaware County, 68.22% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, 2-23-2010. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. In 2012, Pennsylvania Secretary of the Treasury reported issuing more than half a million property tax rebates totaling $238 million.Elias, Joe., Pennsylvania Treasury Department to issue $238 million in property tax rebates, The Harrisburg Patriot-News, June 30, 2012 The program is funded by the Pennsylvania Lottery. Property tax rebates are increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.Pennsylvania Department of Revenue., Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program, June 2012 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. =Sports= The District is assigned to Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) District 1 The District funds the following sports for high school students: ;Boys: *Baseball - AAAA *Basketball - AAAA *Cross Country - AAA *Football - AAAA *Golf - AAA *Indoor Track and Field - AAAA *Lacrosse - AAAA *Soccer - AAA *Swimming and Diving - AAA *Tennis - AAA *Track and Field - AAA *Wrestling - AAA ;Girls: *Basketball - AAAA *Cheerleading - AAAA *Cross Country - AAA *Field Hockey - AAA *Golf - AAA *Indoor Track and Field - AAAA *Lacrosse - AAAA *Soccer (Fall) - AAA *Softball - AAAA *Swimming and Diving - AAA *Tennis - AAA *Track and Field - AAA *Volleyball - AAA *According to PIAA directory July 2012Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletics Association, PIAA School Directory, 2012 ReferencesFurther reading * Upper Darby School District ARRA Case Studies (Archive) External links *Upper Darby School District website *Upper Darby School District website (Archive) *Delaware County Youth Initiative *Upper Darby Performing Arts Center *Delaware County IU 25 *Delaware County Technical High School *Delaware County Workforce Investment Board Category:School districts in Delaware County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Upper Darby School District"},{"id":"2003818","text":"Person passed out on sidewalk - NYC - 2008 - shot using Dutch angle The Dutch angle, also known as Dutch tilt, canted angle, or oblique angle, is a type of camera shot which involves setting the camera at an angle on its roll axis so that the shot is composed with vertical lines at an angle to the side of the frame, or so that the horizon line of the shot is not parallel with the bottom of the camera frame. This produces a viewpoint akin to tilting one's head to the side. In cinematography, the Dutch angle is one of many cinematic techniques often used to portray psychological uneasiness or tension in the subject being filmed. The word \\"Dutch\\" in this context is a bastardisation of the word Deutsch, the German word for \\"German\\"; it is not related to the Dutch people or language. It originated in the First World War, as Navy blockades made the import (and export) of movies impossible. The German movie scene was part of the expressionist movement, which used the Dutch angle extensively. Method cinematographers to set up Dutch angles A Dutch angle is a camera shot in which the camera has been rotated relative to the horizon or vertical lines in the shot. The primary use of such angles is to cause a sense of unease or disorientation for the viewer. Many Dutch angles are static shots, but in a moving Dutch angle shot the camera can pivot, pan or track along the established diagonal axis for the shot. History Dziga Vertov's 1929 experimental documentary Man with a Movie Camera contains uses of the Dutch angle, among other innovative techniques discovered by Vertov himself. The angle was widely used to depict madness, unrest, exoticism, and disorientation in German Expressionism, hence its name Deutsch, meaning German, was often conflated with the etymologically similar word Dutch which gives the corruption of the term now commonly used. Montages of Dutch angles are often structured such that the tilts are horizontally opposed in each shot – for example, a right-tilted shot will be followed with a left-tilted shot, and so on. In Hollywood’s classic age, one filmmaker who used Dutch angles often was Alfred Hitchcock, whose early career included time at UFA studios in Germany; examples include Suspicion (1941), Strangers on a Train (1951), and The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). The 1949 film The Third Man makes extensive use of Dutch angle shots, to emphasize the main character's alienation in a foreign environment. Director Carol Reed has said that William Wyler gave him a spirit level after seeing the film, to sardonically encourage him to use more traditional shooting angles.Charles Thomas Samuels, Encountering Directors, 1972 - interview with Carol Reed, excerpt at wellesnet.com Dutch angles were used extensively in the satirical 1960s Batman TV series (and its 1966 film spin-off) in which each villain had his or her own angle, as they were \\"crooked\\". Dutch angles are frequently used by film directors who have a background in the visual arts, such as Tim Burton (in Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood), and Terry Gilliam (in Brazil, The Fisher King, 12 Monkeys, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Tideland) to represent madness, disorientation, or drug psychosis. In his Evil Dead trilogy, Sam Raimi used Dutch angles to show that a character had become possessed by evil. In Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s Die Sehnsucht der Veronika Voss (1982), a Dutch angle is used (twice) to convey an odd tension that strangers are exerting on the main character. The Dutch angle is an overt cinematographical technique that can be overused. The science-fiction film Battlefield Earth (2000), in particular, drew sharp criticism for its pervasive use of the Dutch angle. In the words of film critic Roger Ebert, \\"the director, Roger Christian, has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why\\". Dutch angles are often used in horror video games, particularly those with static camera angles such as early entries in the Resident Evil and Silent Hill franchises. Similar to their use in movies, these angles are used to bring about a feeling of unease in the player.

New York City Police Department's \\"Steamboat Squad\\" headed by George Gastlin attacked the Hook Gang of river pirates and permanently broke them up in 1876 The Hook Gang was a street gang, and later river pirates, active in New York City in the 1860s and 1870s. The gang was prominent in the Fourth Ward and Corlear's Hook districts immediately after the American Civil War, until their breakup by the New York City Police Department in 1876. History The Hook Gang was formed during the mid-1860s following the American Civil War. Based from New York's Corlear's Hook waterfront on the East River, the gang numbered between 50 and 100 members including James Coffee, Terry Le Strange, Suds Merrick and Tommy Shay. The gang became known for attacking and hijacking shipping. One early robbery took place when James Coffee and Tommy Shay forced a local eight-man rowing club at gunpoint to row the boat to the Brooklyn shore. Within 50 yards of the shore, the rowing team were ordered to jump out and swim to the beach while Coffee and Shay escaped with the boat. One gang member, Slipsey Ward, was arrested and imprisoned at Auburn Prison after attempting to hijack a schooner sailing past Pike Street, killing three of the six man crew before he was detained by the remaining crew members. The gang's downfall occurred when a member by the name of Wallace attempted to hijack a rowboat which contained off-duty police detectives on a fishing trip. After Wallace's arrest, the idea for a Police \\"Steamboat Squad\\" was formed. The remaining members of the gang were arrested by police in 1876.

In 1931 she received her Ph.D. on projective geometry under the direction of Max Dehn, and in 1932 spent a fellowship year in Rome. After her year in Rome, she returned to Germany to lecture at the University of Königsberg and the University of Frankfurt. Denied permission to teach by the minister of education of Nazi Germany, she worked in private industry until 1946, when she became the first woman professor at the University of Frankfurt. Research Moufang's research in projective geometry built upon the work of David Hilbert. She was responsible for ground-breaking work on non-associative algebraic structures, including the Moufang loops named after her. In 1933 Moufang showed Desargues's theorem does not hold in the Cayley plane. The Cayley plane uses octonion coordinates which do not satisfy the associative law. Such connections between geometry and algebra had been previously noted by Karl von Staudt and David Hilbert. Ruth Moufang thus initiated a new branch of geometry called Moufang planes.

Most other states do not have distinctive highway shields for ADHS, however. The Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) is part of the Appalachian Regional Commission in the United States. It consists of a series of highway corridors in the Appalachia region of the eastern United States. The routes are designed as local and regional routes for improving economic development in the historically isolated region. It was established as part of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965, and has been repeatedly supplemented by various federal and state legislative and regulatory actions. The system consists of a mixture of state, U.S., and Interstate routes. The routes are formally designated as \\"corridors\\" and assigned a letter. Signage of these corridors varies from place to place, but where signed are often done so with a distinctive blue-colored sign. A 2019 study found that the construction of the ADHS led to economic net gains of $54 billion (approximately 0.4 percent of national income) and boosted incomes in the Appalachian region by reducing the costs of trade. History 1966 map In 1964, the President's Appalachian Regional Commission (PARC) reported to Congress that economic growth in Appalachia would not be possible until the region's isolation had been overcome. Because the cost of building highways through Appalachia's mountainous terrain was high, the region's local residents had never been served by adequate roads. The existing network of narrow, winding, two-lane roads, snaking through narrow stream valleys or over mountaintops, was slow to drive, unsafe, and in many places worn out. The nation's Interstate Highway System, though extensive through the region, was designed to serve cross-country traffic rather than local residents. The PARC report and the Appalachian governors placed top priority on a modern highway system as the key to economic development. As a result, Congress authorized the construction of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) in the Appalachian Development Act of 1965. The ADHS was designed to generate economic development in previously isolated areas, supplement the interstate system, and provide access to areas within the region as well as to markets in the rest of the nation. Currently, the ADHS is authorized at , including added in January 2004 by Public Law 108-199. By the end of FY 2018, —approximately 90.5 percent of the authorized—were complete, open to traffic, or under construction. Many of the remaining miles will be among the most expensive to build. Corridor Z across southern Georgia is not part of the official system, but has been assigned by the Georgia Department of Transportation. List of ADHS corridorsCorridor A= Corridor A is a highway in the states of Georgia and North Carolina. It travels from Interstate 285 (I-285) north of Atlanta northeasterly to I-40 near Clyde, North Carolina. I-40 continues easterly past Asheville, where it meets I-26 and Corridor B. In Georgia, Corridor A travels along the State Route 400 (SR 400) freeway from I-285 to the SR 141 interchange southwest of Cumming.Appalachian Development Highways Economic Impact Studies , Chapter 3: Highway and Traffic Analysis From here to Nelson, near the north end of I-575, Corridor A has not been constructed; its proposed path is near that of the cancelled Northern Arc. It begins again with a short piece of SR 372, becoming SR 515 when it meets I-575. SR 515 is a four-lane divided highway all the way to Blairsville. From Blairsville to North Carolina, the corridor has not been built, and SR 515 is a two-lane road. The short North Carolina Highway 69 (NC 69) takes Corridor A north to U.S. Route 64 (US 64) near Hayesville. Corridor A turns east on US 64, and after some two-lane sections, it becomes a four-lane highway. Corridor A switches to US 23 near Franklin, and meets the east end of Corridor K near Sylva. From Sylva to its end at I-40 near Clyde, Corridor A uses the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, which carries US 23 most of the way and US 74 for its entire length. Corridor A-1 Corridor A-1 uses US 19/SR 400 from the point that Corridor A leaves it, at SR 141 near Cumming, northeast to SR 53 near Bright. SR 400 continues northeast as a four-lane highway from SR 53 to SR 60 south of Dahlonega; this section was built \\"with APL funds as a local access road\\". =Corridor B= Corridor B is a highway in the states of North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio. It generally follows U.S. Route 23 (US 23) from Interstate 26 (I-26) and I-40 near Asheville, North Carolina, north to Corridor C north of Portsmouth, Ohio. Corridor B uses I-240 from its south end into downtown Asheville, where it uses US 23 (current and future Interstate 26) to Kingsport, Tennessee. The US 23 freeway ends at the Tennessee–Virginia state line, but US 23 is a four-lane divided highway through Virginia and into northeastern Kentucky. At Greysbranch, Kentucky, Corridor B leaves US 23 to turn east on Kentucky Route 10 (KY 10) over the two-lane Jesse Stuart Memorial Bridge into Ohio. The short Ohio State Route 253 (OH 253) connects the bridge to US 52, a freeway that takes Corridor B north to Wheelersburg. US 52 continues west to Portsmouth, the proposed alignment of Corridor B continues north and northwest along Ohio State Route 823 to US 23 near Lucasville. The part of Corridor B north of SR 253 is also part of the I-73/74 North–South Corridor. Corridor B-1 Corridor B-1 travels from KY 10 to the north end of the Portsmouth Bypass. In Kentucky, it follows US 23 and US 23 Truck; after crossing the two-lane Carl Perkins Bridge into Ohio, it uses current and planned SR 852—a western bypass of Portsmouth—and US 23\\\\. Corridors B and B-1 both end near Lucasville, where Corridor C continues north along US 23 to Columbus. =Corridor C= Corridor C is a highway in the U.S. state of Ohio. It is part of U.S. Route 23 (US 23), traveling from the north end of Corridor B near Lucasville north to Interstate 270 (I-270) south of Columbus. , most of the road is a four-lane divided highway, but there are a few gaps yet to be built. Corridor C is part of the I-73/I-74 North–South Corridor. Corridor C-1 Corridor C-1 is a connector from Corridor C near Chillicothe southeast to Corridor D near Jackson, Ohio, along US 35\\\\. It has been completed as a four-lane highway. =Corridor D= Corridor D travels east-west from Interstate 275 (I-275), near Cincinnati, Ohio, to I-79, near Bridgeport, West Virginia. The corridor utilizes Ohio State Route 32 (SR 32) and U.S. Route 50 (US 50). =Corridor E= Interstate 68 (I-68) is a Interstate highway in the U.S. states of West Virginia and Maryland, connecting I-79 in Morgantown to I-70 in Hancock. I-68 is also Corridor E of the Appalachian Development Highway System. From 1965 until the freeway's construction was completed in 1991, it was designated as U.S. Route 48 (US 48). In Maryland, the highway is known as the National Freeway, an homage to the historic National Road, which I-68 parallels between Keysers Ridge and Hancock. The freeway mainly spans rural areas, and crosses numerous mountain ridges along its route. A road cut constructed for it through Sideling Hill exposed geological features of the mountain and has become a tourist attraction. US 219 and US 220 travel concurrently with I-68 in Garrett County and Cumberland, Maryland, respectively, and US 40 overlaps with the freeway from Keysers Ridge to the eastern end of the freeway at Hancock. The construction of I-68 began in 1965 and lasted for about 25 years, being completed on August 2, 1991. While the road was being built, it was predicted that the completion of the road would improve the economic situation along the corridor. The two largest cities connected by the highway are Morgantown and Cumberland, both with populations of fewer than 30,000 people. Despite the fact that the freeway serves no large metropolitan areas, I-68 provides a major transportation route in western Maryland and northern West Virginia and also provides an alternative to the Pennsylvania Turnpike for westbound traffic from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. There have been several major planned road projects that would affect the freeway's corridor, which, due to major funding issues, are unlikely to be completed. These include a plan to extend I-68 to Moundsville, West Virginia, and the plan to link the Mon–Fayette Expressway, a toll highway which meets I-68 east of Morgantown, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. =Corridor F= Corridor F is a highway in the U.S. states of Tennessee and Kentucky. It travels from Interstate 75 (I-75) in Caryville, Tennessee, northeasterly to Corridor B (U.S. Route 23 (US 23)) near Kentucky. Corridor F uses US 25W and Tennessee State Route 63 (SR 63) from I-75 to Corridor S (US 25E) in Harrogate, Tennessee. There, it turns northwest along US 25E, passing through the Cumberland Gap Tunnel into Kentucky. It leaves US 25E in Pineville, Kentucky, turning northeasterly along US 119, past an intersection with Corridor I (Kentucky Route 15 (KY 15)) in Whitesburg, to its end at Corridor B. =Corridor G= Corridor G is a highway in the U.S. states of Kentucky and West Virginia that follows the route of U.S. Route 119 (US 119) from Pikeville, Kentucky, to Charleston, West Virginia. Construction on the road began in 1972 in West Virginia and 1974 in Kentucky, but it was more than two decades before the road was completed in either state. The full length of Corridor G in West Virginia was completed in 1997, but Kentucky's last segment was not opened until 2008. =Corridor H= Corridor H is a highway in the U.S. states of West Virginia and Virginia. It travels from Weston, West Virginia to Strasburg, Virginia. In December 1999, a settlement agreement was reached, providing the framework for resumption of final design, right-of-way acquisition and construction activities on the Corridor H highway project. Corridor H is the only corridor highway that remains incomplete in the State of West Virginia. It begins at I-79 in Weston and will end at I-81 in Strasburg when complete. Virginia's portion of Corridor H runs from the West Virginia state line to I-81 at Strasburg, Virginia. The building of Corridor H was controversial, arousing strong passions for and against. Decades of public debate and legal battles aired the essential question of whether previously isolated areas should be preserved or opened to development. Despite the controversy, about 75 percent of the highway had been completed as of 2013. The highway is open from the Weston exit of I-79 to Kerens, Randolph County and an additional section of the four-lane is open from the Grant-Tucker county line to Wardensville as of July 2016. =Corridor I= Corridor I is a highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It travels from Interstate 64 (I-64) southeasterly along the Mountain Parkway and Kentucky Route 15 (KY 15) to Corridor F (U.S. Route 119 (US 119)) in Whitesburg. Corridor I meets Corridor R (Mountain Parkway) near Campton and Hal Rogers Parkway and KY 80 in Hazard. =Corridor J= Corridor J is a highway in the U.S. states of Tennessee and Kentucky. It travels from the end of Interstate 24 (I-24) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, north to I-75 in London, Kentucky. Corridor J uses U.S. Route 27 (US 27) from Chattanooga north to Soddy-Daisy. There it turns northwest on State Route 111 (SR 111), eventually curving to the north via Dunlap, Sparta, and Cookeville to Livingston. Then it turns northwest on SR 52 to Celina and northeast on SR 53 to Kentucky. Upon crossing into Kentucky, Corridor J becomes Kentucky Route 61 (KY 61), heading north to Burkesville. There it turns east on KY 90, which it follows to Burnside. Corridor J turns north on US 27 at Burnside, quickly turning northeast on KY 914 to bypass downtown Somerset and then east on KY 80 to London. Listed in a US House of Representatives Report in 2002, was a proposed feasibility and the planning study to establish I-175 along Corridor J. However, no allocation of monies was appropriated and no additional discussion has been made since for this briefly proposed interstate along the corridor. Until late 2005, Corridor J was to turn west just north of Cookeville along the planned SR 451 to SR 56 north of Baxter and then use SR 56 and SR 53 via Gainesboro.Stop Corridor J (SR451) Tennessee Department of Transportation, Appalachian Development Highway System Corridor J Corridor J-1 Corridor J-1 runs from Algood west to SR 56, then north to Celina via SR 53 and Gainesboro; it is proposed that the part of the corridor be renumbered as SR 451\\\\. The corridor serves as an alternate route for Corridor J, avoiding Livingston. The entire route is two-lane with wide shoulders, allowing for possible expansion if needed. =Corridor K= Corridor K is a highway in the U.S. states of Tennessee and North Carolina. Overlapped entirely by U.S. Route 74 (US 74), it also shorter concurrences with US 19, US 64, APD-40 (US 64 Bypass) US 129 and US 441\\\\. The corridor connects Interstate 75 (I-75) in Cleveland, Tennessee (northeast of Chattanooga), easterly to Corridor A (US 23) near Dillsboro, North Carolina. US 19/US 74/US 129 (Appalachian Highway), in Murphy There are two gaps in the corridor, one in each state. The gap in Tennessee is the Ocoee Scenic Byway along the Ocoee River from Parksville to Ducktown. Plans outline a new alternate route for this section since the current route does not meet the purpose and need to support the regional transportation goals of a safe, reliable and efficient east-west route. Currently in environmental study, a record of decision is expected in 2017. The gap in North Carolina is located from Andrews to Stecoah. Broken in three projects, the plan outlines a new four-lane expressway that will bypass north of the Nantahala Gorge and connect Robbinsville. At a total cost to NCDOT estimated at $443 million, it is currently in reprioritization. Since the corridor's establishment, the first major improvement for the corridor happened in 1979, when bypasses were completed for Murphy and Andrews. In 1986, US 74 was extended west from Asheville, overlapping all of Corridor K. Its last major improvement was in 2005, with the widening of NC 28 at Stecoah, first completed section Nantahala Gorge bypass. Now at 74.8% of the corridor completed, it features four-lane divided highway predominantly expressway grade, with sections in and around Cleveland, Cherokee and Dillsboro at freeway grade. The corridor also connects the cities of Ducktown and Bryson City, and features the Ocoee National Forest Scenic Byway, in Tennessee, and the Nantahala Byway, in North Carolina; treating travelers with grand vistas and various recreational activities. =Corridor L= Corridor L is a highway in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It follows the path of U.S. Route 19 (US 19) between Beckley and Sutton. By exiting onto Corridor L from Interstate 79 (I-79) at milepost 57, a southbound traveler can eliminate , and $7.25 in tolls, re-entering the interstate system at the West Virginia Turnpike (I-64 and I-77) at milepost 48. Originally, this corridor was built as a four-lane divided highway for only the portion south of US 60; however, the large amount of traffic (as part of the direct route from the cities of Toronto, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh to Florida and a considerable portion of the Atlantic southeast) forced the state to rethink this plan and upgrade the northern half to four lanes as well. =Corridor M= Corridor M is a highway in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It extends (including that are ineligible), with completed, from the I-70/I-76 interchange at New Stanton to an interchange with I-81 near the Pennsylvania Turnpike at Harrisburg, following PA Turnpike 66 and U.S. Route 22\\\\. The estimated cost to complete this corridor is $1.40 billion, including $42 million for prefinanced projects. The remaining work includes the construction of four lanes generally paralleling US 22 between Hollidaysburg and Lewistown. Projects currently under way in Pennsylvania include: * A location study on a section to provide four lanes between Hollidaysburg and Lewistown =Corridor N= Corridor N is a highway in the U.S. states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. It is a designated portion of U.S. Route 219 (US 219), traveling from Corridor E (I-68/US 40) near Grantsville, Maryland, north to Corridor M (US 22 near Ebensburg, Pennsylvania). There is currently an attempt in the U.S. House of Representatives to extend this corridor, in the form of House bill H.R.1544 - Corridor N Extension Act of 2011. The act would extend Corridor N north from its current terminus at Corridor M to Corridor T in southwestern New York. The bill has not yet been brought before Congress for debate. As of January 2019, Corridor N has been completed as a controlled-access highway from just north of Ebensburg to Meyersdale. No portion of the route has been improved in Maryland. =Corridor O= Corridor O is a highway in the U.S. states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. It is part of U.S. Route 220 (US 220), traveling from Corridor E, near Cumberland, Maryland, north to I-80, near Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.

It forms part of a route from Lexington, Kentucky to Roanoke, Virginia using Interstate 64 (I-64), Corridor I, Corridor R, Corridor B, Corridor Q, and I-81. =Corridor S= Corridor S is a highway in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It is routed entirely along U.S. Route 25E (US 25E); from Interstate 81 (I-81), near Morristown, to State Route 63 (SR 63; Corridor F), in Harrogate. In the 2013 fiscal year, has been completed, while remains to be constructed. =Corridor T= Corridor T is a highway in the U.S. states of Pennsylvania and New York. It travels from Greenfield Township, Pennsylvania (northwest of Erie) to Windsor, New York, and corresponds to Interstate 86, an upgrade of the existing New York State Route 17 (NY 17). An extension of the US 219 Southern Expressway will also join I-86. Known as the Southern Tier Expressway and Quickway (split by Interstate 81 (I-81) at Binghamton, New York), I-86 will connect I-90 northeast of Erie, with I-87 (the New York State Thruway) near Harriman, New York. As of August 2008, it travels east from I-90 to NY 352 in Elmira, bringing the total length of highway designated as I-86 to (and remaining to be designated). Once completed, I-86 will stretch 388 miles (624 km) across the Southern Tier of New York from I-90 to I-87,MapQuest driving directions: part 1 and part 2 shorter than the along the New York State Thruway to the north. Several sections of NY 17 are not up to freeway or Interstate Highway standards, and need to be upgraded before I-86 can be designated along its full length. These substandard sections are located near Elmira, Binghamton, and the Catskill Mountains. I-86 currently travels in Pennsylvania and in New York. Except for a section of about that dips into Pennsylvania near Waverly, New York but is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation, the rest of I-86 will be in New York. =Corridor U= Corridor U is a highway in the U.S. states of Pennsylvania and New York. It begins at Corridor P (U.S. Route 220 (US 220)) near Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and proceeds generally northward to Corridor T (Interstate 86 (I-86)) in Elmira, New York. The corridor follows US 15 northward from Williamsport to Tioga Junction, where it turns northeastward to follow Pennsylvania Route 328 (PA 328), New York State Route 328 (NY 328), and New York State Route 14 (NY 14) through Elmira to I-86. The portion along US 15 in Pennsylvania is slated to become Interstate 99. Corridor U-1 Corridor U-1 is a spur from Corridor U at Tioga, Pennsylvania, continuing north along I-99/US 15 to Corning, New York, where it connects with Corridor T (I-86). Only the portion in New York is signed as I-99; the portion in Pennsylvania is slated to become I-99 but is currently only signed as US 15\\\\. =Corridor V= Corridor V is a highway in the U.S. states of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. Its termini are Interstate 55 (I-55) in Batesville, Mississippi, and I-24 west of Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Area known as \\"The Village.\\" Harrison's Cave is a tourist attraction in the country of Barbados, first mentioned in 1795. Tourists can access the subterranean environment on a tramway. History The caves were first mentioned in historical documents in 1795, and were rediscovered in the early 1970s by Jack Peeples. They were developed by the government as part of a tram tour, and opened to the public in 1981. Description Small group of stalagmites, also known as \\"The Altar.\\" It is said the left stalagmite is a woman, and the right stalagmite is a man on his knee proposing. Harrison's Cave is in the central uplands of Barbados. It is situated at above sea level. The three characteristics of the central uplands are gullies, sinkholes and caverns. It is also an entrance for another place of interest: Welchman Hall Gully which is closed. The caves are naturally formed by water erosion through the limestone rock. The calcium-rich water that runs through the caves have formed the unusual stalactites and stalagmites formations. Travel through the caves is by tram, at certain points during the tour visitors are allowed to alight from the tram and get close up to the formations. One main area of the caves is a huge cavern, termed \\"The Great Hall\\", measuring over in height. After the Great Hall the tram stops at \\"The Village\\". At The Village some of the formations have joined together to form columns after thousands of years. Other areas the tram stops along the tour is \\"The Chapel,\\" \\"The Rotunda,\\" and \\"The Altar.\\" Visitors travel through the Boyce Tunnel via tram to all depths of the cave.

It is made from sugar, water, gelatin, vegetable fat or shortening, and glycerol. It does not have the texture of most icings; rolled fondant is akin to stiff clay, while poured fondant is a thick liquid. The word, in French, means \\"melting,\\" coming from the same root as fondue and foundry. However, what the French call \\"fondant\\" is sugar glaze, which has to be applied hot on pastries like \\"mille-feuille,\\" while fondant icing would be referred as \\"pâte à sucre,\\" meaning \\"sugar paste.\\" Types Poured fondant is a creamy confection used as a filling or coating for cakes, pastries, and candies or sweets. In its simplest form, it is sugar and water stabilized with gelatin and glycerine. It is cooked to the soft-ball stage, cooled slightly, and stirred or beaten to incorporate air, until it is an opaque mass with a creamy consistency. Sometimes lemon or vanilla is added to the mixture for taste. Other flavorings are used as well, as are various colorings. An example of its use is the Cadbury Creme Egg, the filling of which is inverted sugar syrup, produced by processing fondant with invertase.LaBau, Elizabeth. What is Invertase? About.com. Retrieved 10 April 2015. Fondant fancies are a type of cake typically coated in poured fondant. Rolled fondant, fondant icing, or pettinice, which is not the same material as poured fondant, is commonly used to decorate wedding cakes. Although wedding cakes are traditionally made with marzipan and royal icing, fondant is increasingly common due to nut allergies as it does not require almond meal. Rolled fondant includes gelatin (or agar in vegetarian recipes) and food-grade glycerine, which keeps the sugar pliable and creates a dough-like consistency. Rolled fondant is rolled out like a pie crust and used to cover the cake. Commercial shelf-stable rolled fondant often consists principally of sugar and hydrogenated oil. However, different formulations for commercial shelf-stable fondant are available and include other ingredients, such as sugar, cellulose gum, and water. Marshmallow fondant is a form of rolled fondant often made and used by home bakers and hobbyists. Marshmallow fondant is made by combining melted shelf-stable marshmallows, water, powdered sugar, and solid vegetable shortening. Home bakers use this recipe for homemade fondant due to the readily available access to required ingredients. Sculpting fondant is similar to rolled fondant but with a stiffer consistency, which makes it a good sculpting material. Sugar paste or gum paste is similar to rolled fondant, but hardens completely—and therefore is used for bigger cake decorations, such as bride and groom figures, bigger flowers, etc. Sugar paste is made mainly of egg whites, powdered sugar, and shortening. Tylose can be added to make gum paste more pliable for detailed work. Physical chemistry Poured fondant is formed by supersaturating water with sucrose. More than twice as much sugar dissolves in water at the boiling point than at room temperature. After the sucrose dissolves, if the solution is left to cool undisturbed, the sugar remains dissolved in a supersaturated solution until nucleation occurs. While the solution is supersaturated, if a cook puts a seed crystal (undissolved sucrose) into the mix, or agitates the solution, the dissolved sucrose crystallizes to form large, crunchy crystals (which is how rock candy is made). However, if the cook lets the solution cool undisturbed and then stirs it vigorously, it forms many tiny crystals, resulting in a smooth-textured fondant.

Margaret Garner (called \\"Peggy\\") was an enslaved African- American woman in pre-Civil War America who was notoriousor celebratedfor killing her own daughter rather than allowing the child to be returned to slavery. She and her family had escaped in January 1856 across the frozen Ohio River to Cincinnati, but they were apprehended by U.S. Marshals acting under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Margaret Garner's defense attorney, John Jolliffe, moved to have her tried for murder in Ohio, to be able to get a trial in a free state and to challenge the Fugitive Slave Law as well. Her story was the inspiration for the novel Beloved (1987) by Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison, which was adapted into a film of the same name starring Oprah Winfrey (1998), as well as for her libretto for the opera Margaret Garner (2005), composed by Richard Danielpour. Other pieces of fiction inspired by Garner's story include, John Jolliffe's Belle Scott (1856), N.K. Jemisin's The Fifth Season (2015), and K.A. Simpson's A Coven's Lament (2017). Early life Garner, described as a mulatto, was born a house slave to the Gaines family of Maplewood plantation, Boone County, Kentucky. She may have been the daughter of the plantation owner John Pollard Gaines himself. Margaret married one of her fellow slaves, Robert Garner, in 1849. That December, the plantation was sold along with all the slaves to John P. Gaines' younger brother, Archibald K. Gaines. The Garners' first child, Thomas, was born early in 1850. Three of Margaret's later children (Samuel, Mary, and Priscilla) were described as mulattoes; each was born five to seven months after a child born to Archibald K. Gaines and his wife. These light-skinned children were likely the children of A.K. Gaines, the only adult white male at Maplewood. The timing suggests they were each conceived after his wife had become pregnant and was sexually unavailable to him. In a contemporary account, abolitionist Levi Coffin described Margaret Garner at her arrest as \\"a mulatto, about five feet high ... she appeared to be about twenty-one or twenty-three years old.\\" She also had an old scar on the left side of her forehead and cheek, which she said had been caused when a \\"White man struck me.\\" Her two boys were about four and six years old, Mary, two and a half, and Priscilla, an infant. Escape and trial On January 28, 1856, Robert and a pregnant Margaret, together with family members, escaped and fled to Cincinnati, Ohio, along with several other enslaved families. Robert had stolen his master's horses and sleigh along with his gun. Seventeen people were reported to have been in their party. In the coldest winter in 60 years, the Ohio River had frozen. The group crossed the ice just west of Covington, Kentucky at daybreak, and escaped to Cincinnati, then divided to avoid detection. Robert and Margaret and their four children, with Robert's father Simon and his wife Mary, made their way to a former slave, Margaret's Uncle Joe Kite, who lived along Mill Creek, below Cincinnati. The other nine slaves in their party reached safe houses in Cincinnati and eventually escaped via the Underground Railroad to Canada. Kite went to abolitionist Levi Coffin for advice on how to get the group to safety. Coffin agreed to help them escape the city, and told Kite to take the Garner group further west of the city, where many free blacks lived, and to wait until night. Slave catchers and U.S. Marshals found the Garners barricaded inside Kite's house before he returned. They surrounded the property, then stormed the house. Robert Garner fired several shots and wounded at least one deputy marshal. Margaret killed her two-year-old daughter with a butcher knife rather than see the child returned to slavery. She had wounded her other children, preparing to kill them and herself, when she was subdued by the posse. The entire group was taken to jail. The subsequent trial lasted for two weeks, after which the judge deliberated another two weeks. It was \\"the longest and most complicated case of its kind.\\" A typical fugitive slave hearing would have lasted less than a day. The core issue was whether the Garners would be tried as persons, and charged with the murder of their daughter, or tried as property under the Fugitive Slave Law. The defense attorney argued that Ohio's right to protect its citizens should take precedence. The slave catchers and owner argued for the precedence of federal law over the state. The defense attempted to prove that Margaret had been liberated under a former law covering slaves taken into free states for other work. Her attorney proposed that she be charged with murder so that the case would be tried in a free state (understanding that the governor would later pardon her). The prosecuting attorney argued that the federal Fugitive Slave Law took precedence over state murder charges. Over a thousand people turned out each day to watch the proceedings, lining the streets outside the courthouse. Five hundred men were deputized to maintain order in the town. The presiding judge, Pendery, ruled that Federal fugitive warrants had supervening authority. Defense attorney John Jolliffe then tried a strategy of arguing that the Fugitive Slave Act violated the guarantee of religious freedom, by compelling citizens to participate in evil by returning slaves. In the end, Pendery rejected this argument. On the closing day of the trial, the antislavery activist Lucy Stone took the stand to defend her earlier conversations with Margaret (the prosecution had complained.) She spoke about the interracial sexual relationship that underlay part of the case: > Recalling to everyone's memory the faces of Margaret's children, and of A. > K. Gaines, Stone told the packed courtroom: \\"The faded faces of the Negro > children tell too plainly to what degradation the female slaves submit. > Rather than give her daughter to that life, she killed it. If in her deep > maternal love she felt the impulse to send her child back to God, to save it > from coming woe, who shall say she had no right not to do so?\\" Margaret Garner's actions were driven by her master's abuse and the well known abuse slaves faced nationwide. Women were known to practice infanticide to alleviate the burden of slavery from their children; however, in Garner's case her children faced even more opposition due to their being mulattos. Mulattoes were seen as a threat as well as a disgrace among the plantation and white families, because the birth of mulatto children highlighted infidelity within the slave-owning families. They reminded the family of a perceived sin, and were often beaten or sold. Garner underwent drastic measures to protect her child not only from the cruelty of the institution of slavery, but from the double threat, due to the child's mulatto status. Margaret Garner was not immediately tried for murder, but was forced to return to a slave state along with Robert and their youngest child, a daughter of about nine months old. When Ohio authorities got an extradition warrant for Garner to try her for murder, they were unable to find her for the arrest. Archibald K. Gaines, her owner, kept moving her between cities in Kentucky. Ohio officials missed finding Margaret in Covington by a few hours, missed getting her again in Frankfort, and finally caught up with her master in Louisville, only to discover that he had put the slaves on a boat headed for his brother's plantation in Arkansas. Sent South The Liberator reported, that on 6 March 1856, the steamboat Henry Lewis, on which the Garners were being transported, began to sink after colliding with another boat. Margaret Garner and her baby daughter were thrown overboard during the collision. The baby drowned. It was reported that Margaret was happy that her baby had died and that she tried to drown herself. She and Robert were kept in Arkansas only a short time before being sent to Gaines' family friends in New Orleans as a household servant. The Garners then disappeared from sight. In 1870 a reporter from The Cincinnati Chronicle found Robert Garner and gathered more about his life. Robert and Margaret Garner had worked in New Orleans, and in 1857 were sold to Judge Dewitt Clinton Bonham for plantation labor at Tennessee Landing, Mississippi. Robert said Margaret had died in 1858 of typhoid fever, in an epidemic in the valley. He said that before she died, Margaret urged him to \\"never marry again in slavery, but to live in hope of freedom.\\" Memorialized Garner's life story was the basis of Frances Harper's 1859 poem \\"Slave Mother: A Tale of Ohio\\". She also inspired Kentucky painter Thomas Satterwhite Noble's 1867 painting, The Modern Medea; Medea was a woman in Greek mythology who killed her own children. The painting, owned by Cincinnati manufacturer Procter and Gamble Corporation, was presented as a gift to the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, where it remains on permanent display. Learning about Margaret Garner's trial and story, Toni Morrison was inspired to write her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Beloved (1987). Years later the Michigan Opera Theatre, Cincinnati Opera and the Opera Company of Philadelphia commissioned the opera Margaret Garner. Morrison wrote the libretto and music was composed by the Grammy-winning Richard Danielpour. The opera premiered in those three cities in 2005. It set records for opera attendance in Cincinnati. In Detroit, it played to unusually large audiences with a high number of African Americans. It was sold out in Philadelphia. Mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves sang Margaret Garner, and baritone Rod Gilfry sang the role of the plantation owner Edward Gaines. In 2008 Joanne Caputo self- published \\"Margaret Garner: Diversity and Depth of Love.\\" The non-fiction two- book manuscript includes a memoir, in which Caputo describes her paranormal experiences with Margaret Garner and a claim of being Garner's reincarnated murdered daughter.

Eisenhower Army Medical Center (EAMC) is a 93-bed medical treatment facility located on Fort Gordon, Ga., located near Augusta, Georgia that previously served as the headquarters of the Army's Southeast Regional Medical Command (SERMC). SERMC oversaw the Army's hospitals and clinics within the southeastern United States and Puerto Rico. SERMC was renamed Southern Regional Medical Command (SRMC) and was relocated to San Antonio in 2009.  History  The hospital started as Camp Gordon Station Hospital in 1941, caring for World War II casualties and dependents. It was closed in 1946, but reopened as Camp Gordon became the more permanent Fort Gordon during the Cold War. The hospital's current building, opened for patients in 1976, replaced sprawling wooden buildings from the World War II era. During the building's dedication a year prior its opening, it was dedicated in honor of former General of the U.S. Army and President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who made his farewell address to the Army at Fort Gordon in 1961. During one visit in 1965 he suffered a heart attack and was treated in a large private suite in the old hospital for two weeks before being sent to Walter Reed in Washington by train. Later in 1975, former First Lady Mamie Eisenhower, was treated at Ft. Gordon for internal bleeding.  Current-day activities  Active-duty personnel and their TRICARE beneficiaries use the medical center and clinics for their primary health care. Numerous military retirees in the Augusta area use the medical center's pharmacy and facilities. EAMC is involved in the growing field of disaster medicine and hosts disaster-drill training events on Fort Gordon involving the civilian medical community and the local region of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The hospital is a training hospital for military doctors, and partners with the Medical College of Georgia and Augusta Veterans Affairs Medical Center in training programs and patient care. For example, TRICARE dependents in need of obstetrics services are sent to UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF AUGUSTA, while the Augusta VA runs a spinal-cord rehabilitation unit and an active duty rehabilitation unit, which has hosted many veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In return, civilian, non-TRICARE dependent patients are often sent to Eisenhower for use of its hyperbaric chamber.  Wound Care Center  The Wound Care Center is one of the most advanced in the DoD. The state-of-the-art wound care center has recently added ultrasonic wound debriders to minimize tissue damage caused by severe bacterial infections. EAMC’s hyperbaric chamber is the only clinical hyperbaric chamber in the U.S. Army and the only multiplace chamber in the Central Savannah River Area. The chamber can also be used to treat a wide variety of issues including air or gas embolisms, carbon monoxide poisoning, decompression sickness (The Bends), anemia, radiation tissue damage, and thermal burns.  DoD/VA Sharing Agreements  EAMC is pioneering DoD/VA sharing agreements with the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Augusta, Ga., Dublin, Ga., and Columbia, S.C., and network agreements with other hospitals and medical centers in the Augusta area. The relationships have infused millions of dollars into the Augusta community, as well as provided veterans, beneficiaries and family members with better access to the care and procedures they need. There are Two Hyberbaric Chambers at Doctors Hospital in Augusta Georgia  Cardiothoracic Surgery Center  EAMC’s Cardiothoracic Surgery Clinic does more heart surgeries than any medical facility in the DoD. A wide range of cardiac, thoracic, vascular services, and minimally invasive techniques are used to address cardiothoracic issues.  Residential Treatment Facility  The 30-bed Residential Treatment Facility is an American Society of Addiction Medicine Level III facility and the second RTF facility in the DoD and the only facility in the Southern Region Medical Command. ASAM Level III Programs are the highest level of multidisciplinary treatment programs and provide care to the full spectrum of patients with alcohol and substance dependence disorders combined with conditions such as PTSD, Depression, and mild Traumatic Brain Injury.

It travels from Bridgeport, West Virginia to Cincinnati, Ohio. It travels US 50 for much of its eastern portion. The western portion of road in Ohio is known as State Route 32. ADHS Funding is separate from other Federal Highway funds.  Route description  West Virginia = The east end of Corridor D begins on US 50 between Clarksburg and Bridgeport, West Virginia, at Interstate 79. US 50 continues on its westerly heading toward Parkersburg and intersects Interstate 77 just outside downtown Parkersburg. The highway continues over the Ohio River on the Blennerhassett Island Bridge. = Ohio = After crossing the Ohio River into Belpre, Ohio, the highway joins with State Route 32 and starts southwest for about then turns northwest for another reaching Athens. The combined US-50/OH-32 makes another turn southwest for about . Then, US 50 and OH-32 diverge. US-50 begins heading west, OH-32, southwest. Corridor D follows OH-32 about to Jackson, where it is intersected by U.S. Route 35. The highway heads due west for about and intersects U.S. Route 23, Corridor C between Portsmouth and Chillicothe. OH-32 continues west for about into Cincinnati, crossing U.S. Route 62, U.S. Route 68 and Interstate 275, Cincinnati's beltway, in the process.  History  Blennerhassett Island Bridge near Parkersburg, WV. Corridor D ramp marker in Parkersburg, West Virginia showing the symbol WVDOH uses for Appalachian Corridor mile and ramp markers. One of the original 23 corridors, Corridor D (U.S. Highway 50) was to provide access to major urban centers along the east coast from the midwest, while creating economic development for northwest and North-Central West Virginia and southeast Ohio. The Blennerhassett Island Bridge, a tied-arch bridge, opened to traffic on June 13, 2008 over the Ohio River thus completing Corridor D in its entirety. = West Virginia = The earliest segment of Corridor D, or US 50, to open in West Virginia was a six- mile (10 km) segment in 1967 \\"Release Date Report\\". West Virginia Department of Transportation. August 2003. from an isolated point near Sherwood in Doddridge County (MP 15) to WV 23 in Salem in Harrison County (MP 1.52). Two years later, a segment from Salem east to CR 11 at Wolf Summit (MP 7) opened to traffic. In 1970, major portions of Corridor D opened to traffic: # A brief segment in Wood County from MP 8 to MP 11 near Murphytown. # A lengthy segment in Wood County from WV 31 near Deerwalk (MP 15.41) to MP 4 at Nutter Farm in Ritchie County near North Bend State Park, a distance of seven miles (11 km). # A segment of US 50 in Ritchie County at WV 74 at Pennsboro (MP 17) east to Doddridge County at West Union (MP 5.5). Most of Corridor D opened a year later. # A segment four-lane upgrade of US 50 opened in Wood County from Interstate 77 east of Parkersburg (MP 4) to MP 8 near Murphytown. # A segment within Wood County from MP 11 near Murphytown to Sandhill (MP 15.41). This connected the disjointed segments between #1 and #2 listed above. # The majority of Ritchie County's US 50 segment opened from MP 4 near North Bend State Park to WV 74 at Pennsboro (MP 17). This connected the disjointed segments between #2 and #3 listed above. # A segment in Doddridge County from MP 5.52 near West Union east to WV 23 near Salem (MP 15). In 1974, a segment of Corridor D in Harrison County opened to traffic from CR 11 at Wolf Summit (MP 7) to the CR 11 at Wilsonburg (MP 11). In 1977, this was extended eastward to WV 20 at Montpelier east of Clarksburg (MP 15.5), and a year later, to Interstate 79 west of Bridgeport (MP 18.25).  Completion into Ohio  Construction began in 2000 with the start of the Godbey Fields complex in Parkersburg, West Virginia. The $6.5 million athletic complex was finished in 2001. Several contracts were let soon after, which included grading and drainage for part of Corridor D, a new Corning Glass Bridge for WV 47, and another span that would carry US 50 over WV 47 and 7th Street in Parkersburg. On September 8, 2003, the first segment of Corridor D opened. The four-lane controlled-access highway stretched from Interstate 77 to WV 47 in Parkersburg. On September 20, 2004, the second portion of Corridor D opened from WV 47 to WV 14, which included the construction of a Little Kanawha River crossing. With this segment open to traffic, 1/3 of the Parkersburg Corridor D segment was complete. On March 9, 2005, a tied arch Ohio River crossing design was chosen from four designs as it was the \\"most economical and least intrusive on the environment of Blennerhassett Island. The $120 million eight- span bridge will include an tied arch over the main channel of the Ohio River and will stretch for from both abutments with a vertical clearance. It is being constructed from weathering steel and will connect WV 892 to OH 618. At the time of its contract letting in April 2005, it was the largest single highway contract in West Virginia's history. The bridge is expected to be complete in 2007. On July 12, 2005, it was announced that the final Corridor D contract in West Virginia was to be awarded. This would complete paving and signing operations of from the WV 892, WV 95, and WV 68 interchange to River Hill Road. In Ohio, a single contract was announced that would connect the Ohio River span to U.S. Route 50 which would be completed in 2007. In August 2005, Corridor D was opened to traffic from WV 14 to WV 68. In mid-September 2005, Corridor D was completed from Fifth Street in Parkersburg to WV 892, WV 95, and WV 68. This segment was constructed under five contracts and required the completion of ten bridges. As of April 23, 2006, construction on the Corridor D mainlines from Interstate 77 to WV 892 is all but complete. The last segment, from WV 892 to the WV 892, WV 95, and WV 68 interchange, was slated to open in August. On August 31, 2006, it was announced that from WV 892/WV 68 to the WV 892 interchange, Corridor D was open to traffic. This four-lane divided freeway is the final roadway section of the corridor from Clarksburg and Cincinnati without the Ohio River crossing. The last Corridor D project, the Blennerhasset Bridge crossing the Ohio River, was opened on June 13, 2008. There are long-range plans to expand the diamond interchange at Interstate 77 into a fully directional interchange at a cost of $60 million. It is ranked 75th.\\"Priority Average Composite Sheet1\\".

He is an American Japanophile, and member of the Mad Gear gang. AppearancesIn video games= Sodom originally appeared in the 1989 beat-em-up game Final Fight, where he is the boss of the Subway stage. An underground wrestling promoter dressed in a samurai-style helmet and gear, Sodom fights the player in an underground ring in the Metro City's subway, wielding two katana swords. In 1993's Mighty Final Fight, there are three Sodoms (or Katanas, as the character is called in the English version), known as the Three Katana Brothers. Sodom's first appearance in the Street Fighter series was in the original Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams on 1995. According to Tatsuya Minami, senior manager of Capcom's Product Planning and Design section, Capcom included Sodom in the game because he was popular and easy to translate to the one-on-one fighting genre. In the Alpha series, he is characterized as an American Japanophile, who is greatly fascinated by Japanese culture but misunderstands it. After being defeated by Guy in Final Fight, Sodom recognizes his wrong perception of Japan and travels there to re- educate himself. He develops a new fighting style based on Japanese and Western martial arts and trades his swords for a pair of jitte. In the first Alpha, he seeks to rebuild the Mad Gear gang by defeating his rival Guy in combat. In his ending, he reforms the gang and holds up a poster reading . In his ending in 1996's Street Fighter Alpha 2, Sodom goes to a sumo ring in Japan to seek new members for the reformed Mad Gear and ends up being challenged by E. Honda. In 1998's Street Fighter Alpha 3, he seeks a new hideout for his gang and goes to claim Shadaloo's new underground base as his own when he learns about it from his former ally Rolento. He crashes his truck into M. Bison's to foil his plot. Apart from the Alpha series, Sodom appears as a playable character in 1999's Final Fight Revenge and makes two cameos in 1997's Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix. Sodom makes a cameo in the background of a stage in 2012's Street Fighter X Tekken. =Other appearances= Sodom makes a cameo appearance in the 1999 anime film Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation as a fighter who travels with Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li and some other fighters to Dr. Sadler's laboratory to find and rescue Ryu's alleged younger brother, Shun, though Sodom's comments hint that he is only doing it to prove he is not a coward. As the fighters battle it out to demonstrate their skills to Sadler, Sodom takes on Ken, but is beaten. He and the other fighters are later imprisoned in a cell to have their fighting Ki stripped, but they are released by Ken and Chun-Li. For Capcom's 15th anniversary of Street Fighter, SOTA Toys released a series of action figures, amongst which was Sodom. The figure was fully posable with 16 points of articulation, and modeled after his Street Fighter Alpha appearance.Series 1 Street Fighter Action Figures. Toymania. Retrieved on 2008-07-02. Development In the English-language localization of Final Fight for the Super NES and Sega CD, Sodom was renamed Katana. The name change was repeated in the SNES version of Street Fighter Alpha 2 to maintain consistency. The initial name change was due to its reference to sodomy, as well as a possible religious reference to Sodom and Gomorrah. In the Street Fighter Alpha games, Sodom is an American character trying to speak Japanese, he is a comedic object of ridicule in his failed attempts at the language. In the Japanese version of Street Fighter Alpha, Sodom's inability to speak fluent Japanese is portrayed in his win quotes by having him use English words that are pronounced similarly to whatever Japanese words he is trying to say with a Japanese translation below. Sodom wears tabi and geta, gauntlets, blue jeans, body armor, and a samurai kabuto with a mask. On the front of his outfit, Sodom has attempted to scrawl the Japanese kanji shi (死), meaning \\"death\\". However, he has not written the kanji properly, and thus its meaning is lost. He is never seen fighting without a pair of jitte or katana swords, making him one of the few characters to appear in the Street Fighter series to use weaponry. In the Japanese version of Final Fight, the katana are named Masamune and Muramasa. In the first two Street Fighter Alpha games, Sodom uses a pair of jitte as weapons instead of his katana blades from Final Fight. However, in Street Fighter Alpha 3, if the player plays as Sodom in X-ism mode, then Sodom will use his katana blades from Final Fight instead of the jitte.All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting 1987–2000, page 323. Reception Sodom was included in the UGO Networks top 50 Street Fighter characters, as well on its list of fighting games' craziest characters, with a comment: \\"Street Fighter series has seen its share of oddball characters, but few are as goofy as Sodom.\\" Doug Perry from IGN called him a \\"stupid\\" character and asked who would ever play him.

Located in the square of the same name and founded in 1483, the old church was erected by the Garcia del Castillo family at the time of the town's foundation. It still has the original gateway, an example of Sevillian-Portuguese Gothic architecture. The towers, however, are an example of early 20th neo-Gothic construction. The real marvels are inside the building: the statue of Christ on the main altar, made from corn dough by the Purépecha Mexican Indians, brought here before 1550, the Flemish Gothic main altar, which dates back to before 1516, and the triptych of the Virgin Mary, brought from Flanders, also in the 16th century, depicting five religious scenes.mytravelguide.com Telde has 101 archaeological sites and 709 listed sites of ethnographic interest. The number of sites increases each year, as do new aspects of old fields, but most are in disrepair and many are disappearing. Some of the most prominent are the coastal town of Tufia, in good condition and extensively excavated by archaeologists; Four Doors (Cuatro Puertas), a large cave with four doors located on top of a mountain overlooking the plain adjoined to a village of cave houses with collective barn at the back; the caves of Tara and Cendro, remains of the ancient centre of population; the town of Draguillo on the border with Ingenio; las cuevas Chalasia which consist of a labyrinthine series of artificial caves linked by tunnels; and the impressive necropolis of Jinámar which includes more than 500 tombs of various types.

SIM Campus development and extension  SIM has announced a Master Plan to further expand its Clementi campus at a platform topping up ceremony on October 9, 2009. The SIM Campus Development Master Plan which will cost $300 million and is expected to be completed by 2014 will be rolled out in two phases. It will render an additional 56,000 square meters of space, more than double its current campus, thus consolidating its position as the largest private tertiary institution in Singapore, both in terms of total campus size and student enrolment. The extended campus will cater primarily to the growing needs of the SIM University (UniSIM). As the only private university recognized by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to award its own degrees, UniSIM caters to the tertiary education and lifelong learning needs of working adults. Offering over 40 programmes from four schools, its graduate and post-graduate degree programmes offered through a flexible mode of study are used by working adults who are looking for higher qualifications, career advancement or self-fulfillment. With the added incentive of a MOE subsidy of up to 40% for its students introduced in 2008, UniSIM has seen a substantial jump in its enrolment. It now has some 10,000 students, compared to 8,000 in 2007. This number is expected to grow by another 40% to 14,000 by 2020. UniSIM caps its annual intake to only about half of applications received due to limited facilities.

Lathrop, A.S.C. (October 22, 1912 - April 12, 1995) was an American cinematographer noted for his skills with wide screen technology and detailed approach to lighting and camera placement. Routledge, Chris. \\"Lathrop, Philip H.\\" International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers, edited by Sara Pendergast and Tom Pendergast, 4th ed., vol. 4: Writers and Production Artists, St. James Press, 2000, p. 508-509. Gale Virtual Reference Library. 17 Nov. 2016. He spent most of his life in movie studios. Lathrop was known for such films as Touch of Evil (1958), Lonely Are the Brave (1962), The Americanization of Emily (1964), The Cincinnati Kid (1965), Point Blank (1967), Finian's Rainbow (1968), The Traveling Executioner (1970), Portnoy's Complaint (1972), Earthquake (1974), Swashbuckler (1976), The Driver (1978), Moment by Moment (1978), A Change of Seasons (1980), Foolin' Around (1980), Loving Couples (1980), and Deadly Friend (1986). He was a long-time member of the ASC Board of Directors, as well as co-chairman of the ASC Awards committee. He also participated in the affairs of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Turner, George E. \\"American Cinematographer (1995) - In Memoriam: Philip H. Lathrop, ASC.\\" American Cinematographer 76.6 (1995): 132. Web. 16 Nov. 2016. Early life Lathrop was born in Merced, California on October 22, 1912. As a child, the Universal Studios lot was his playground, where his mother was employed in the film lab. Lathrop became a member there in the camera department at 18-years old. There, he watched Gilbert Warrenton, ASC, photograph the first version of Show Boat in 1928-29. On the 1936 version of the film, Lathrop loaded cameras from John Mescall, ASC. Personal life Lathrop had two marriages, to Molly Lathrop and Betty Jo Lathrop, and three sons, Larry, Bill and Clark. Career Lathrop began his career as a film loader in Universal’s camera department in 1934 for Russell Metty, ASC, on the Irving Reis film, All My Sons. In 1938, he became assistant to Universal’s top-ranking cinematographer Joseph A. Valentine, ASC, and worked on the Deanna Durbin pictures, The Wolf Man, and two Alfred Hitchcock classics, Saboteur and Shadow of a Doubt. Later, he once again worked as a camera operator with Russell Metty for nine years where he shot the opening of Orson Welles’ Touch of Evil, one of the most renowned boom shots in the history of cinema. Lathrop becomes director of photography at Universal in 1958. His first feature that year was The Perfect Furlough, which was shot in CinemaScope and Eastman Color, with director Blake Edwards who Lathrop also worked with on Experiment in Terror, Days of Wine and Roses, and The Pink Panther. In 1959, Lathrop and Edwards collaborated on the television series, Peter Gunn and Mr. Lucky. Using the new Panavision lenses, Lathrop shot the 1962 black and white drama, Lonely Are the Brave, with director David Miller in New Mexico’s Sandia Mountains—this is an early example of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Lathrop’s particular visual style seems to epitomize the times, such as in Point Blank, directed by John Boorman in 1967, where a glossy, dense feel was utilized to a tough thriller. In this film, color charts were prepared for each scene—the colors were subdued and desaturated and no scene was ever too bright or showy. After Point Blank, Lathrop worked on Francis Ford Coppola’s Finian’s Rainbow, another unusual color film. He was inducted into the ASC Hall of Fame in 1974. During the 1980s, Lathrop worked on eight television movies-of-the-week as well as several mini-series, winning him several Emmys. He died of cancer on April 12, 1995 in Los Angeles, the same year he was honored with the 1992 ASC Lifetime Achievement Award. Services were held at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Hollywood Hills where Stanley Cortez, ASC, delivered the eulogy. Photography in Earthquake In the 1974 disaster film Earthquake, Lathrop made director Mark Robson’s vision of the movie come true. Robson wanted a natural look for the film, without its being documentary-like. Instead of shooting in natural locations, Earthquake was filmed almost entirely on the Universal Studios' sound stages and back-lot due to the extraordinary degree of control deemed necessary to execute the required special effects. To bring the earthquake scenes to life, a shaker mount for the camera was created. Lathrop said it “created an amazing illusion. You’d swear that the ground was going up and down and moving sideways, when, of course, it wasn’t moving at all.” Sets were also built on shaker platforms, which is incredibly costly so “in the sets that were not on shaker platforms, [it] was [difficult] to get the actors to move as if they were responding to an earthquake, when there wasn’t one,” he added.Lathrop, Philip H. \\"THE PHOTOGRAPHY.\\" American Cinematographer 55.11 (1974): 1300. USC Libraries. Web. 17 Nov. 2016. A five-story section of what is supposed to be a 25-story building was made in Stage 12, the highest in the studio, where every floor was used to shoot the action. Lathrop stated that “it was necessary to dig down 20 feet into the floor of the stage in order to accommodate [the building model].” He continued, “[the] photography of this sequence was difficult because of the way [they] had to light the set” to avoid shadows from the hanging lights when the simulated earthquakes took place. So “in order to light it, [Lathrop] went clear up above the grids with four arcs pointed down to simulate the angle of the sun. [He] matched each of the arcs on the way down and didn’t overlap them, nor did [he] use any fill light at all.” To execute a film like Earthquake, natural sets would have been very limiting. Shooting on set allows for control in the lighting and to “do things with the camera that would have been impossible in a natural set,” said Lathrop. Without a single day off of work after Earthquake, Lathrop immediately began working on Airport 1975, also for Universal Studios.

He played first-class cricket for Kent and Worcestershire, and appeared in 41 Test matches and 36 ODIs for England. He is perhaps best remembered for his tail-end batting with Ian Botham in England's second innings against Australia at Headingley in 1981, reaching his highest Test score of 56 in an eighth-wicket partnership of 117 in 80 minutes. This helped England to win despite their following-on and being quoted as 500–1 outsiders. Cricket correspondent Colin Bateman, commenting on his effectiveness, noted, \\"... when it all worked, it worked beautifully\\". Life and career Dilley was born and raised in Dartford, Kent, England, attended Dartford High School, and played his early cricket for Dartford Cricket Club at Hesketh Park. He trained as a diamond cutter in Hatton Garden before embarking on a cricketing career with Kent County Cricket Club. He played for the Kent Second XI in 1976, aged 17. He was married and divorced twice. Kent cricketer Graham Johnson was a brother-in-law. He had four children, including Chris Pennell, vice captain of Worcester Warriors rugby team. His youngest son, Jonathan, has also represented Gloucestershire Second XI as a Left Arm Orthodox Spin Bowler. =Early career= Dilley made his first-class debut for Kent at the age of eighteen in 1977, against Cambridge University. He failed to take a wicket, and was not selected again until the following season. He played his second match in June 1978 against the touring Pakistan team, but again failed to take a wicket. It was only in his third first-class match, against Middlesex, that he made his presence felt, taking seven wickets in the match to help his team to a six-wicket win. Dilley played two more first-class matches that season, but took only one wicket. Perhaps more significant was his selection for England Young Cricketers against their West Indian counterparts for two of the three \\"Tests\\" and the single one-day game. Real progress in county cricket, however, would have to wait for 1979, when Dilley played 31 senior games for Kent, including a useful effort of 4–41 in the World Cup warm-up match against the New Zealanders. He finished with 49 first-class wickets at an average of 23.48 that season, and already his express pace was attracting attention. =England selection= The England selectors, looking for a young fast bowler for that winter's tour of Australia, took the bold decision to include the 20-year-old Dilley in the squad. He made his international debut in a One Day International on 24 November 1979 against West Indies at Sydney during the 1979/80 Benson & Hedges World Series Cup, a triangular tournament that also featured Australia. England won the match by two runs. Dilley was given the new ball, and struck in his third over when he claimed the wicket of Desmond Haynes. Rain enforced a revised target; the West Indies needed to score 198 runs in 47 overs, but fell short and lost the match. Dilley finished with 6–2–21–1, with an economy rate of 3.50 runs per over. A fortnight later, Dilley appeared in his first Test match, making him the youngest cricketer to play for England in thirty years when he entered the field during the Perth Test at the WACA on 14 December 1979. England captain Mike Brearley showed confidence in Dilley and gave him the new ball at the start of the Australian first innings. Dilley did well during his initial bowling spell, but had to wait until Australia lost their fifth wicket on 127 runs to claim his first Test wicket. The batsman was Peter Toohey, caught by Derek Underwood for 19. Dilley then claimed his second wicket when Rod Marsh was caught behind by Bob Taylor. Marsh had scored 42 runs and Australia were 219 for 7 at that point. Australia finished 244 all out, and Dilley took figures of 18–1–47–2 with an economy rate of 2.61. However, his debut bowling performance was overshadowed by Botham taking 6 for 78. England were all out for 228, giving a lead of 16 runs to Australia. Dilley scored an unbeaten 38, and stayed at the wicket for 206 minutes, facing 57 balls. His score was the second-highest in the innings, after Brearley. Dilley again took the new ball in Australia's second innings, but did not get a wicket until Dennis Lillee gave a catch to Peter Willey at gully. Lillee scored 19 runs and England needed 354 runs for victory. Geoff Boycott showed resistance with an unbeaten 99, and Dilley made a partnership of nineteen runs with Boycott for eighth wicket. England finished 215 all out, and Australia won the Test by 138 runs. He acquitted himself reasonably well, taking three wickets and scoring a handy unbeaten 38 in the first innings. The game featured a memorable item on the second-innings scorecard: :Lillee c Willey b Dilley 19 England lost the match by 138 runs, and although Dilley also played in the second Test, which was also lost, he was replaced by John Lever for the third and final game. Dilley took only seven wickets on that tour – \\"£7,000 for seven wickets\\" as the tour manager Alec Bedser commented. The Australians triumphed in this match as well, to win the rubber 3–0, although the Ashes were not at stake, and were retained by England on the basis of their 5–1 victory in the six-game series that had been played a year earlier. In 1980, Dilley was not selected until the third Test against West Indies, at Old Trafford. Rain intervened, as it was to do in the fourth and fifth Tests as well, and all were drawn. Dilley's eleven wickets, in the three innings he was able to make use of, made sure of his place to face the same opponents in the Caribbean that winter. England were outplayed in the overseas Tests and lost the four-match series 2–0 (the Guyana Test having been cancelled over the Robin Jackman affair) and both ODIs, but Dilley's ten wickets were enough for him to retain his place for the 1981 Ashes series. Dilley began the 1981 Ashes series strongly, taking 12 wickets in the first two Tests, and was thus retained for the third Test at Headingley. This game is best remembered for England's sensational victory after following on, and for the heroics of Ian Botham and Bob Willis, but Dilley played his part as well, albeit in the unfamiliar role of batsman. Coming to the crease in the second innings with England at 135–7, 92 runs in arrears, Dilley had no orders from his captain, Mike Brearley, when he joined Botham at the crease. Botham said, \\"Right then, let's have a bit of fun\\", and the two men put on 117 in just 80 minutes before Dilley (56, from 75 balls) was bowled by Terry Alderman. England eventually established a lead of 130, and Dilley then held a boundary catch to dismiss Rod Marsh in Australia's second innings. Exceptional bowling by Bob Willis (8–43) resulted in Australia being dismissed for 111, and gave England an unexpected victory by 18 runs. Despite his part in the win at Headingley, Dilley did not play in the fourth Test, nor in the two that followed, being replaced variously by John Emburey, Paul Allott and Mike Hendrick. He did get picked for the subsequent 1981/2 India tour, having pulled out of Graham Gooch's rebel tour of South Africa, something he regretted for financial reasons.http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/535446.html =Injury and recovery= Despite being in and out of the side for the next couple of years, Dilley's future as a Test player seemed reasonably bright by 1983, and he played a full part in England's World Cup campaign. Following the tournament, a neck injury forced him out of the game for a year, and although he returned to county cricket in 1985, there was some doubt as to his long- term prospects. A decent performance that winter for Natal helped in his rehabilitation and, by 1986, Dilley took 63 first-class wickets and earned a recall to the England side. Between 1986 and 1988, Dilley took 83 Test wickets at an average of 26.43, and was generally regarded as England's foremost strike bowler. He developed significant pace and outswing from a long, wide run up, approaching the wicket at an angle almost 45 degrees. Perhaps his most significant success came in 1986/87 when he took 5–68 in the first innings of the first Test at Brisbane to help his team to a victory that set them on their way to an Ashes win, and he also took 20 wickets at 15.85 in ODIs. In the drawn series against New Zealand the following winter he produced his career-best bowling figures, ripping through the Kiwi line-up with 6–38 (including the first five wickets to fall) at Lancaster Park, Christchurch. He was fined £250 in the same match for swearing at the umpire, comments which were clearly picked up by the stump microphone. He took a further 5–60 in Auckland, and finished the series with fifteen wickets at an average of 14. =Bowling style= His bowling style often fascinated many, with his unusual run-up a topic of discussion. It is believed that he tried to adopt Jeff Thomson's slingy bowling style, and later Dilley's style was used by Chris Cairns in New Zealand. In 1988, when talking about the effects of coaching fast bowlers, Geoffrey Boycott commented, \\"Remember what happened to Graham Dilley, who started out as a genuinely quick bowler. They started stuffing line and length in his ear and now he has Dennis Lillee's action with Denis Thatcher's pace\\". =Later career= For the 1987 season, Dilley moved to Worcestershire, and his new county were about to begin the most successful period in their history, winning four trophies in the next three years. Despite further injury problems, he proved a vital cog in the wheel as Worcestershire won the 1988 and 1989 County Championships; it was during this period that he wrote, with team-mate Graeme Hick, an account of one of the title-winning seasons, entitled Hick'n'Dilley Circus. Dilley's Test career was beginning to wind down by this time, and his final match was at Edgbaston in the 1989 Ashes series. He made certain that he would not be picked again by accompanying Mike Gatting on the rebel tour to South Africa that winter, although he continued to play for his county for a couple more years. Dilley appeared in three of Worcestershire's matches in April 1992, but despite a couple of appearances in the Second XI, he announced his retirement at the end of that season because of recurring injury problems. =Retirement= Dilley's move to Worcestershire denied him the financial security of a benefit season. He found employment after retirement as a coach, firstly for the England women's cricket team, and then accompanying the men's side on the tour to India in 2001/02. He also worked in a coaching capacity for Zimbabwe and Scotland. His last position was as head coach for Loughborough UCCE, where he was director of cricket for 11 years and coached, among others, Monty Panesar, James Anyon, Ruel Brathwaite, James Adams and Rob Taylor. =Personal life= Dilley was the father of the Worcester Warriors rugby union captain, Chris Pennell.Telegraph.co.uk Dilley died in a hospice in Leicester on 5 October 2011, aged 52, just one week after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. A memorial service was held in Worcester Cathedral on Wednesday 9 November 2011.

Barthé is best known for his portrayal of black subjects. The focus of his artistic work was portraying the diversity and spirituality of man. Barthé once said: \\"All my life I have been interested in trying to capture the spiritual quality I see and feel in people, and I feel that the human figure as God made it, is the best means of expressing this spirit in man.\\"Adams (1978) Early life James Richmond Barthé was born in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. His father's name is Richmond Barthé and mother's name is Marie Clementine Robateau. Barthé's father died at age 22, when he was only a few months old, leaving his mother to raise him alone. She worked as a dressmaker and before Barthé began elementary school she remarried to William Franklin, with whom she eventually had five additional children.Lewis (2009) Barthé showed a passion and skill for drawing from an early age. His mother was, in many ways, instrumental in his decision to pursue art as a vocation. Barthé once said: \\"When I was crawling on the floor, my mother gave me paper and pencil to play with. It kept me quiet while she did her errands. At six years old I started painting. A lady my mother sewed for gave me a set of watercolors. By that time, I could draw very well.\\"Bearden, Henderson (1993) Barthé continued making drawings throughout his childhood and adolescence, under the encouragement of his teachers. His fourth grade teacher, Inez Labat, from the Bay St. Louis Public School, influenced his aesthetic development by encouraging his artistic growth. When he was only twelve years old, Barthé exhibited his work at the Bay St. Louis Country Fair.Vendryes (2008), 14 However, young Barthé was beset with health problems, and after an attack of typhoid fever at age 14, he withdrew from school.Vendryes (2008), 14. Following this, he worked as a houseboy and handyman, but still spent his free time drawing. A wealthy family, the Ponds, who spent summers at Bay St. Louis, invited Barthé to work for them as a houseboy in New Orleans, Louisiana. Through his employment with the Ponds, Barthé broadened his cultural horizons and knowledge of art, and was introduced to Lyle Saxon, a local writer for the Times Picayune. Saxon was fighting against the racist system of school segregation, and tried unsuccessfully to get Barthé registered in an art school in New Orleans.Vendryes (2008), 19 In 1924, Barthé donated his first oil painting to a local Catholic church to be auctioned at a fundraiser. Impressed by his talent, Reverend Harry F. Kane encouraged Barthé to pursue his artistic career and raised money for him to undertake studies in fine art. At age 23, with less than a high school education and no formal training in art, Barthé applied to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the Art Institute of Chicago, and was accepted by the latter.Vendryes (2008), 22. Chicago During the next four years Barthé followed a curriculum structured for majors in painting. During this time he boarded with his aunt Rose and made a living working different jobs.Lewis (2009), 33 His work caught the attention of Dr. Charles Maceo Thompson, a patron of the arts and supporter of many talented young black artists. Barthé was a flattering portrait painter, and Dr. Thompson helped him to secure many lucrative commissions from the city's affluent black citizens. At the Art Institute of Chicago, Barthé's formal artistic instruction in sculpture took place in anatomy class with professor of anatomy and German artist Charles Schroeder. Students practiced modeling in clay to gain a better understanding of the three-dimensional form. This experience proved to be, according to Barthé, a turning point in his career, shifting his attention away from painting and toward sculpture.Vendryes (2008), 27 Barthé had his debut as a professional sculptor at The Negro in Art Week exhibition in 1927 while still a student of painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. He also exhibited in the April 1928 annual exhibition of the Chicago Art League. The critical acclaim allowed Barthé to enjoy numerous important commissions such as the busts of Henry O. Tanner (1928) and Toussaint L’Ouverture (1928). Although he was still in his late 20s, within a short time he won recognition, primarily through his sculptures, for making significant contributions to modern African American art. By 1929, the essentials of his artistic education complete, Barthé decided to leave Chicago and head for New York City.Vendryes (2008). New York City While many young artists found it very difficult to earn a living from their art during the Great Depression, the 1930s were Richmond Barthé's most prolific years.Vendryes (2008), 57. The shift from the Art Institute of Chicago to New York City, where he moved following graduation, exposed Barthé to new experiences as he arrived in the city during the peak of the Harlem Renaissance. He established his studio in Harlem in 1930 after winning the Julius Rosenwald Fund fellowship at his first solo exhibition at the Women's City Club in Chicago. However, in 1931, he moved his studio in Harlem to Greenwich Village. Barthé once said: \\"I live downtown because it is much more convenient for my contacts from whom it is possible for me to make a living.\\" He understood the importance of public relations and keeping abreast of collectors' interests. Barthé mingled with the bohemian circles of downtown Manhattan. Initially unable to afford live models, he sought and found inspiration from on-stage performers. Living downtown provided him the opportunity to socialize not only among collectors but also among artists, dance performers, and actors. His remarkable visual memory permitted him to work without models, producing numerous representations of the human body in movement. During this time, he completed works such as Black Narcissus (1929), The Blackberry Woman (1930), Drum Major (1928), The Breakaway (1929), busts of Alain Locke (1928), bust of A’leila Walker (1928), The Deviled Crab-Man (1929), Rose McClendon (1932), Féral Benga (1935), and Sir John Gielgud as Hamlet (1935). In October 1933, a major body of Barthé's work inaugurated the Caz Delbo Galleries at the Rockefeller Center in New York City. The same year, his works were exhibited at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933. In Summmer 1934, Barthé went on a tour to Paris with Reverend Edward F. Murphy, a friend of Reverend Kane from New Orleans, who exchanged his first class ticket for two third-class tickets to share with Barthé. This trip exposed Barthé to classical art, but also to performers such as Féral Benga and African American entertainer Josephine Baker, of whom he made portraits in 1935 and 1951, respectively.Vendryes (2008) During the next two decades, he built his reputation as a sculptor. He was awarded several awards and has experienced success after success and was considered by writers and critics as one of the leading \\"moderns\\" of his time. Among his African-American friends were Wallace Thurman, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, Jimmie Daniels, Countee Cullen, and Harold Jackman. Ralph Ellison was his first student. Supporters who were white included Carl Van Vechten, Noel Sullivan, Charles Cullen, Lincoln Kirstein, Paul Cadmus, Edgar Kaufmann Jr., and Jared French. In 1945, Barthé became a member of the National Sculpture Society.Gates (2004), 52. Later life Booker T. Washington, 1946, National Portrait Gallery Eventually, the tense environment and violence of the city began to take its toll, and he decided to abandon his life of fame and move to Jamaica in the West Indies in 1947. His career flourished in Jamaica, and he remained there until the mid-1960s when ever-growing violence forced him to move again. For the next five years, he lived in Switzerland, Spain, and Italy, then settled in Pasadena, California in a rental apartment. In this apartment, Barthé worked on his memoirs, and most importantly, editioned many of his works with the financial assistance of actor James Garner until his death in 1989. Garner copyrighted Barthé's artwork, hired a biographer to organize and document his work, and established the Richmond Barthe Trust.Lewis (2009). Public works Barthé's first public commission came from the New York City's Federal Art Project and for the 80-foot bas-relief in cast stone, (1939), for the embellishment of the Harlem River Houses complex, but upon completion, his work was installed at the Kingsborough Houses in Brooklyn.Vendryes (2008), 82. His other most notable public works include a monumental bronze of Toussaint L’Ouverture, (1950), in front of the National Palace in Port-au-Prince, Haiti; 40-foot bronze equestrian statue Jean Jacques Dessalines, (1952), at Champs-du-Mars, Port-au- Prince, Haiti; a cast stone relief of American Eagle, (1940), on the façade of Social Security Board Building in Washington, DC; a marble Arthur Brisbane Memorial in New York City, (1939), a later enlarged version of a sculpture of Rose McClendon (1932), for Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, (c.1935);^It is possible to see the finished version of Rose McClendon in the artist's studio in the 1935 Bucher's silent movie A Study of Negro Artists. and the design of several Haitian coins, still in use today.http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Richmond_Barthe.aspx . Retrieved March 18, 2015. =Haitian works= Barthe's Haitian works came in a time after his 1950 move to Ocho Rios, Jamaica, and were among his larger and more famous works.Vendryes (2009), 143-152. The huge 40-foot equestrian bronze of Jean Jacques Dessalines, (1952), was one of four heroic sculptures commissioned in 1948 by Haitian political leaders to mark independence celebrations. The Dessalines monument was part of a larger 1954 restoration of the Champs-du- Mars park in Port-au-Prince, Barthe's 40-foot-high Toussaint L’Ouverture statue (1950), and stone monument was positioned nearer the National Palace, and was unveiled in 1950 with two other commissioned heroic sculptures (in the capital and in the north of the county) by Cuban sculptor Blanco Ramos. At the time, one African-American newspaper called the collection \\"the Greatest Negro Monuments on earth.\\" Pamphile (2001), 163. L'Overture was a subject Barthe returned to several times, having created a bust (1926) and painted portrait (1929) of the figure early in his career.Vendryes (2009), 23, 42. Exhibitions Barthé's debut as a professional sculptor was at The Negro in Art Week exhibition in Chicago in 1927.Vendryes (2008), 27. His first solo exhibition was held at the Women's City Club in Chicago in 1930, exhibiting a selection of 38 works of sculpture, painting, and works on paper.Vendryes (2008), 37. In 1932, the Whitney Museum of American Art decided to purchase a bronze copy of the Blackberry Woman (1930) after exhibiting it at the opening exhibition of Contemporary American Artists in 1932.Vendryes (2008), Barthé's work was paired with drawings by Delacroix, Matisse, Laurencin, Daumier, and Forain at the Caz-Delbo Gallery in 1933 in New York City.Vendryes (2008), 58. In 1942, he had an exhibition of 20 works of art at the South Side Community Art Center in Chicago. The retrospective which included works from private collections shown for the first time, Richmond Barthé: The Seeker was the inaugural exhibition of the African American Galleries at the Ohr-O'Keefe Museum of Art in Biloxi, Mississippi, curated by Margaret Rose Vendryes, PhD. Barthé's most recent retrospective, titled Richmond Barthé: His Life in Art, consisted of over 30 sculptures and photographs.http://www.a-r-t.com/barthe/ , Retrieved February 6, 2015.

Collections The Whitney Museum of American Art purchased Barthé's bronze copy of the Blackberry Woman (1930) in 1932, after the inaugural exhibition Whitney Annual in 1932. The African Dancer (1933) was purchased after being displayed in Whitney Annual in 1933 as well as the Comedian in 1935. The Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased The Boxer (1942) after Artists for Victory exhibition at the same museum in 1942.Vendryes (2008), 115. Barthé's other pieces are in the collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum; the Art Institute of Chicago, Fallingwater, and others. Recognition Richmond Barthé received many honors during his career, including the Rosenwald Fellowship in 1930 and the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1940. Barthé was also the first African American artist to be represented, together with the painter Jacob Lawrence, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's permanent collection. In 1945, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He also received awards for interracial justice and honorary degrees from Xavier University and St. Francis University. He was the recipient of the Audubon Artists Gold Medal in 1950. A few years after his arrival in Pasadena, California, the city renamed the street where Barthé lived as Barthé Drive. He also was honored and received an award from U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 1980. Personal lifeSexuality= Once, when interviewed, Barthé indicated that he was homosexual. Throughout his life, he had occasional romantic relationships that were short-lived.Vendryes (2008), 36. In an undated letter to Alain Locke, he indicated that he desired a long- term relationship with a \\"Negro friend and a lover\\". The book Barthé: A Life in Sculpture by Margaret Rose Vandryes links Barthé to writer Lyle Saxon, to African American art critic Alain Locke, young sculptor John Rhoden, and the photographer Carl Van Vechten. According to a letter from Alain Locke to Richard Bruce Nugent, Barthé had a romantic relationship with Nugent, a cast member from the production of Porgy & Bess.Nugent (2002), 24. =Religious beliefs= Barthé was a devoted Catholic. Many of Barthé's later work depicted religious subjects, including John the Baptist (1942), Come Unto Me (1945), Head of Jesus (1949), Angry Christ (1946), and Resurrection (1969). Works like The Mother (1935), Mary (1945), or his unfinished Crucifixion (ca. 1944) are noticeably influenced by the interracial justice for what he was awarded the James J. Hoey Award by the Catholic Interracial Council in 1945. ReferencesBibliography * Adams, Russell L. Great Negroes: Past and Present.

He is depicted as a wooden figure with a nail in the head and with a hammer, or occasionally on shaman drums, two hammers. It has been suggested that name is derived from that of the Norse god Thor. Characteristics and functions Idols of Horagalles are made of wood and have a nail or spike and a piece of flint in the head.Kaarle Krohn, \\"Lappische Beiträge zur germanischen Mythologie,\\" Finnisch-Ugrische Forschungen 6 (1906) 155-80, p. 164 Johannes Scheffer, The History of Lapland: wherein are shewed the original manners, habits, marriages, conjurations, etc., of that people, Oxford, 1674, cited in Matthias Alexander Castrén, Nordiska Resor och Forskningar volume 3, Helsinki: Finska Litteratursällskapet, 1853, p. 206 He has a hammer called Wetschera, Aijeke Wetschera,Scheffer, cited in Castrén, p. 50.Johannes Schefferus, Lappland, tr.

He punishes \\"hurtful demons\\" or \\"evil spirits\\" (i.e., trolls) who frequent the rocks and mountains; he destroys them with his lightning, shoots them with his bow, or dashes their brains out with his hammer. The rainbow is his bow, \\"Aijeke dauge\\".The History of Lapland, 1674 translated ed., facsimile ed. Suecica rediviva 22, Stockholm: Rediviva, 1971, , p. 37. =Horagalles depicted on Sami shaman drums= Depiction of Horagalles from a Sami shaman drum found in Norway. The drum symbols were copied by the Christian priest Thomas von Westen in the 18th century.Friis, p. 35. The two hammers of the thunder god depicted as a blue cross on a late 18th-century shaman drum from Porsanger, Western Finnmark, Norway, described by the Christian missionary Knud Leem.Friis, p. 141. On Sami shaman drums Horagalles was occasionally depicted with a sledgehammer in one hand and a cross-hammer in the other, or symbolized by two crossed hammers. He made thunder and lightning with one hammer and withdrew them with the other to prevent damage. Name and relationship to other gods The name Horagalles does not occur in older dictionaries of Sami languages, for instance in the mid-19th century.Nils Vibe Stockfleth, Norsk-lappisk Ordbog. Christiania: Cappelen, 1852. He is often equated with Tiermes; in 1673 Johannes Scheffer, who did not use the name Horagalles, wrote that when Aijeke thundered, he was called Tiermes. There is considerable regional variation in the names; Horagalles (with its various spellings, including Thoragalles) is characteristically southern Sami, and the rainbow is referred to by a variety of names referring to thunder.Friis, pp. 65-66.Håkan Rydving, The End of Drum- Time: Religious Change among the Lule Sami, 1670s-1740s, doctoral dissertation, Acta universitatis upsaliensis, Historia Religionum 12, Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell, 1993, , p. 19. Early scholars noted the similarities between Horagalles and the Norse thunder-god Thor and that some Sami called him Thoron or simply Thor, and were unsure which had influenced which.Friis, p. 66. But the name Horagalles is now interpreted as a loanword from the Old Norse Þórr Karl, \\"the Old Man Thor,\\"E. O. G. Turville-Petre, (1964).

The name Ravdna resembles North Germanic names for the tree, such as Old Norse reynir, and according to the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál, the rowan is called \\"the salvation of Thor\\" because Thor once saved himself by clinging to it. It has therefore been theorized that the Norse goddess Sif, Thor's wife, was once conceived of in the form of a rowan to which Thor clung. =Tiermes= Tiermes is a Sami god of thunder and rain, also called Aijeke or Ajeke and often identified with Horagalles. Tiermes is god of the sky and thunder and lightning, the rainbow, weather, oceans, and lakes and rules over human life, health, and well-being. He protects people and their animals from \\"hurtful demons\\" and \\"evil spirits\\" (i.e., trolls).Matthias Alexander Castrén, Nordiska Resor och Forskningar volume 3, Helsinki: Finska Litteratursällskapet, 1853, pp. 49-51 According to the mid-18th century Cérémonies et coutumes religieuses de tous les peuples du monde, \\"Thiermes or Thoron\\" is the first in a trinity, of whom the other members are Storjunkare and Baivre or Jumala.Cérémonies et coutumes religieuses de tous les peuples du monde, ed.

The tracks controlled by the ARTC are located in all states except Australian Capital Territory & Tasmania, and were previously run by six separate state railways in an uncoordinated fashion that gave an advantage to road transport. By combining the infrastructure under one corporation it was expected that a more integrated and coordinated one-stop-shop would be created. It provides its own reporting numbers to trains that operate on its network. The ARTC does not control any of the narrow gauge track in Queensland or South Australia, nor broad gauge track in Victoria. However it does control the Albion to Jacana freight line which has been partially converted to dual gauge for use as a passing lane, but is considered a main line on the broad gauge network. =Owned corridors= *Adelaide to Serviceton (Melbourne-Adelaide line) *Adelaide to Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie (Adelaide-Port Augusta & Trans-Australian Railway) *Port Augusta to Whyalla (Whyalla line) *Crystal Brook to Broken Hill (Crystal Brook-Broken Hill line) *Tarcoola to Darwin, leased to Asia Pacific Transport Consortium *Sefton to Macarthur (Southern Sydney Freight Line) =Leased corridors= *Melbourne to Albury (North East line) *Melbourne to Serviceton (Western line) *Maroona to Portland (Portland line) *Port Botany to Sefton (Metropolitan Goods line) *Macarthur to Albury (Main South line) *Unanderra to Moss Vale (Unanderra to Moss Vale line) *Cootamundra to Parkes (Cootamundra to Parkes line) *Parkes to Broken Hill (Broken Hil line) *Parkes to Narromine *Troy Junction to Merrygoen line *Broadmeadow to Brisbane (North Coast line) *Maitland to North Star (Main North line) *Muswellbrook to Gulgong References Category:Commonwealth Government-owned companies of Australia Category:Interstate rail in Australia Category:Railway companies established in 1998 Category:Railway infrastructure companies of Australia Category:Australian companies established in 1998 ","title":"Australian Rail Track Corporation"},{"id":"2004090","text":"Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) is an organic compound with the formula C6H4(COOCH3)2. It is the diester formed from terephthalic acid and methanol. It is a white solid that melts to give a distillable colourless liquid.Richard J. Sheehan \\"Terephthalic Acid, Dimethyl Terephthalate, and Isophthalic Acid\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. Production Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) has been produced in a number of ways. Conventionally, and still of commercial value, is the direct esterification of terephthalic acid. Alternatively, it can be prepared by alternating oxidation and methyl-esterification steps from p-xylene via methyl p-toluate (PT). =Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) (Witten Process)= The common method for the production of DMT from p-xylene (PX) and methanol consists of a multistep process involving both oxidation and esterification. A mixture of p-xylene (PX) and methyl p-toluate is oxidized with air in the presence of a cobalt and manganese catalysts. The acid mixture resulting from the oxidation is esterified with methanol to produce a mixture of esters. The crude ester mixture is distilled to remove all the heavy boilers and residue produced; the lighter esters are recycled to the oxidation section. The raw DMT is then sent to the crystallization section to remove DMT isomers, residual acids and aromatic aldehydes. Structure of monomethyl terephthalate. Oxidation of methyl p-toluate followed by esterification also yields dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) as shown in the below reaction: :Esterification of the resulting acid with methanol Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) production through direct esterification If highly impure terephthalic acid is available, DMT can be made in a separate process by esterification with methanol to dimethyl terephthalate, which is then purified by distillation: :C8H6O4 \\\\+ 2CH3OH → C10H10O4 \\\\+ 2 H2O at presence of o-xylene at 250–300 °C. Use DMT is used in the production of polyesters, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT), and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). It consists of benzene substituted with carboxymethyl groups (CO2CH3) at the 1 and 4 positions. Because DMT is volatile, it is an intermediate in some schemes for the recycling of PET, e.g. from plastic bottles. Hydrogenation of DMT affords the diol cyclohexanedimethanol, which is a useful monomer.

It can be used for intranets, extranets and internets. CBAC can be configured to permit specified TCP and UDP traffic through a firewall only when the connection is initiated from within the network needing protection. (In other words, CBAC can inspect traffic for sessions that originate from the external network.) However, while this example discusses inspecting traffic for sessions that originate from the external network, CBAC can inspect traffic for sessions that originate from either side of the firewall. This is the basic function of a stateful inspection firewall. Without CBAC, traffic filtering is limited to access list implementations that examine packets at the network layer, or at most, the transport layer. However, CBAC examines not only network layer and transport layer information but also examines the application-layer protocol information (such as FTP connection information) to learn about the state of the TCP or UDP session. This allows support of protocols that involve multiple channels created as a result of negotiations in the FTP control channel. Most of the multimedia protocols as well as some other protocols (such as FTP, RPC, and SQL*Net) involve multiple control channels. CBAC inspects traffic that travels through the firewall to discover and manage state information for TCP and UDP sessions. This state information is used to create temporary openings in the firewall's access lists to allow return traffic and additional data connections for permissible sessions (sessions that originated from within the protected internal network). CBAC works through deep packet inspection and hence Cisco calls it 'IOS firewall' in their Internetwork Operating System (IOS).

A book on Jackson’s career, Handsome Ransom Jackson: Accidental Big Leaguer, was published in 2016. He died at his home on March 20, 2019. Before Major League Baseball After a year at the University of Arkansas, he transferred twice, and helped lead the football teams of Texas Christian University (1945) and the University of Texas at Austin (1946) to consecutive Cotton Bowl Classic appearances as a halfback. Playing baseball in college he hit .500, .438 and .400. The Majors The Chicago Cubs signed him in 1947. On 2 May 1950, the 24-year-old made his major-league debut. \\"Handsome Ransom\\" had four solid seasons at third base for the Cubs from 1951 to 1955. Jackson followed up a slow rookie season (in which he had 111 at-bats over 34 games) with a solid second season, in which he hit .276 with 76 RBI and 16 home runs. He struggled again in his third major-league season, his average falling to .232, with 34 RBI and 9 home runs. Jackson rebounded over the next three seasons, posting batting averages of .285 (1953), .273 (1954), and .265 (1955). His RBI (66, 67, and 70) and home run (19, 19, and 21) totals also rebounded. Nor did his defensive play lag behind: in 1955, Jackson led the National League (NL) in double plays. His hitting and excellent play at third earned him consecutive trips to the All-Star Game in his last two seasons in Chicago. In the 1954 game he came off the bench behind starter Ray Jablonski of the St. Louis Cardinals, in an 11–9 loss to the American League (AL). The next season, 1955, he again came off the bench, in a 6–5 win for the National League, behind the Milwaukee Braves' Eddie Mathews. On the strength of Jackson's five continuous seasons in Chicago, the Dodgers, looking for a replacement for their aging All-Star third baseman Jackie Robinson, traded Don Hoak, Russ Meyer and Walt Moryn to the Cubs for Jackson and Don Elston. Jackson played off the bench behind Robinson in 1956. Despite having over 200 fewer plate appearances than in his previous year, he managed a .274 average with 8 home runs and 53 RBI. The Dodgers played in the famed \\"subway Series\\" against their hated cross-town rivals, the New York Yankees in the 1956 World Series, but Jackson had only three pinch-hit at-bats, going 0-for-3, with two strike-outs. The following season (1957), Jackson suffered a major knee injury, ending his chances to become a star for the Dodgers. He played off the bench, not appearing in more than 64 games in a season for the rest of his career. He totaled only eight more home runs and 43 RBIs combined for the next three seasons. Notable games * 28 June 1951: Hits a home run in the seventh inning to help the Cubs Frank Hiller to a \\"one-hitter\\", winning 8–0 over the St. Louis Cardinals, facing just 27 batters. * 15 August 1953: Tied a NL record by grounding into three double-plays against the Milwaukee Braves in a 2–0 loss (Joe Torre would later break the record). * 17 April 1954: With the wind at his back, he had four hits, including a home run which hit an apartment building on Waveland Avenue, across from Wrigley Field, in a NL record three-hour and 43-minute game against the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cubs won the game 23–13, the highest scoring game ever between these two rivals, and the two teams combine for 35 hits, including five homers and a 10-run Chicago 5th inning, with Jim Brosnan the winning pitcher over Gerry Staley. * 28 September 1957: Hit the final home run in Brooklyn Dodgers history before the team moved to Los Angeles for the 1958 season in an 8-4 victory over the Phillies. * Another unusual game occurred on June 29, 1956, where he was playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers against the Philadelphia Phillies, who were leading 5-2 going into the bottom of the ninth inning. Pee Wee Reese was on second base when Duke Snider preceded Jackson with a home run which brought the game to 5-4. Jackson then hit a home run to tie the game, and on the next pitch Gil Hodges hit another home run to win the game for the Dodgers, being the only time in Major League Baseball history where a baseball game ended with three consecutive home runs. Transactions * 9 December 1955: Traded to the Dodgers for Don Hoak (3B) and Walt Moryn (OF).

A cadet branch of the Agilolfings also ruled the Kingdom of the Lombards intermittently from 616 to 712. They are mentioned as the leading dynasty in the Lex Baiuvariorum (c. 743). Their Bavarian residence was at Regensburg. The dynasty's eponymous ancestor is Agilulf, a semi-legendary prince of the Suebi and descendant of Hermeric, the 5th-century Suevic king of Galicia, possibly identical with one Agilulf, a steward of the Visigothic king Theoderic II, who was executed in 457.Jörg Jarnut: Agilolfingerstudien.

Garibald I himself married Waldrada, the widow of Merovingian king Theudebald, in 555, after her marriage to Chlothar I was annulled on grounds of consanguinity.

Roderick Grierson (vice-president), Milbry Polk, and several other individuals for the purpose of furthering understanding among cultures by organizing and exchanging international art exhibitions. Over the course of the next 15 years, InterCultura organized and brought to the U.S. over a dozen important exhibitions from countries as diverse as Ethiopia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, and many other nations. Exhibitions of American art were sent abroad by InterCultura in exchange. Activities InterCultura's practice was to bring together the leading scholars with great objects of art to produce exhibitions of outstanding scholarship. InterCultura's activities involved multi-project exchange programs supported by U.S. embassies in foreign countries to send U.S. art abroad in exchange for exhibitions from foreign national collections coming to the U.S. The Blood of Kings: A New Interpretation of Maya Art The first major exhibition initiated by InterCultura was \\"The Blood of Kings: A New Interpretation of Maya Art,\\" which opened at the Kimbell Art Museum in 1986. The Blood of Kings exemplified the InterCultura approach in that it was a presentation of ground-breaking scholarship, curated by two of the leaders of the group of scholars that had recently deciphered the Maya script: Linda Schele, of the University of Texas, and Mary Miller, of Yale University. The exhibition demonstrated, through a never-before-assembled collection of ancient Maya art borrowed from sources as diverse as the British Museum and the Government of Honduras, the imperative of an entirely new approach based on the decipherment of the Maya writing system. It revealed the Maya as real individuals - kings, queens, and royal dynasties as blood-thirsty and colorful as their Old World counterparts. The power of the exhibition was critical in the collapse of the old view of the Maya as peaceable mathematicians, and the emergence of the currently accepted picture of the Maya. The catalog remains a landmark addition to Maya scholarship and is widely cited. 10+10: Contemporary Soviet and American Painters Starting in 1987, at the dawn of the glasnost era, InterCultura organized an exhibition titled \\"10 + 10: Contemporary Soviet and American Painters,\\" the first exhibition of dissident or \\"non-official\\" art from the then-Soviet Union to be seen in US and Soviet museums. Following on this, in 1988 InterCultura negotiated the most extensive cultural exchange program ever signed between the then-Soviet Ministry of Culture and a private U.S. institution. Included was the most extensive exhibition presented in the US of the 19th century Russian group of painters called the Wanderers, titled \\"The Wanderers: Masters of 19th Century Russian Painting.\\" The InterCultura US- Soviet exhibition exchange program survived the change from the Soviet Union to post-Soviet Russia, and the exchange concluded in 1993 with the most important exhibition of Medieval Russian art ever shown in the United States, a show of treasures from the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg titled \\"The Gates of Mystery,\\" , which was also seen in the UK at the Victoria & Albert Museum. Other exhibitions Other exhibitions organized by InterCultura included \\"The Art of Private Devotion: Mexican Retablo Painting,\\" the first major exhibition of Ethiopian art borrowed from Ethiopian sources ever held in the U.S., titled \\"African Zion: Sacred Art of Ethiopia,\\" the first major exhibition of the art of American painter Robert Motherwell shown in Mexico, titled \\"Robert Motherwell: An Open Door,\\", a major exhibition of Georgia O'Keeffe shown in Mexico and Japan, titled \\"Georgia O'Keeffe: American and Modern,\\", an exhibition of contemporary Japanese art, titled \\"Seven Artists: Aspects of Contemporary Japanese Art,\\" and numerous additional shows on subjects ranging from modern Italian master drawings to Mexican dance masks. Museums with exhibitions Museums at which InterCultura Exhibitions were shown include: Albright-Knox Art Gallery (Buffalo), Art Institute of Chicago, California Afro-American Museum (Los Angeles), Central Exhibition Hall (St. Petersburg, Russia), Cincinnati Art Museum, Corcoran Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.), Dallas Museum of Art, Davenport Museum of Art, DuSable Museum of African American History (Chicago), Field Museum of Natural History, Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, Hayward Gallery (London), Henry Art Gallery (University of Washington), Kimbell Art Museum, Milwaukee Art Museum, Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Museum of African-American Life & Culture (Dallas), Palacio de Bellas Artes (Mexico City), Rufino Tamayo Museum (Mexico City), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Sarah Blaffer Gallery (Houston), Serpentine Gallery (London), State Picture Gallery of Georgia (Tbilisi), The Art Museum, Princeton University, The Schomburg Center for Research in Black African Culture (New York), The Walters Art Museum, Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), Victoria and Albert Museum (London), Yokohama Art Museum (Japan), and others.

It was released in the UK (RCA PL 70060) and the US (Allegiance Records AV 437) in January 1984. History By 1983, Donovan's albums were receiving little distribution in the UK and none in the US. His popularity had steadily decreased through the 1970s and early 1980s and mainstream record companies were not convinced that Donovan's albums could generate enough record sales to warrant release. Donovan decided that to win over the record companies and reach his American and British fans, he would record new versions of both \\"Sunshine Superman\\" and \\"Season of the Witch\\" for inclusion on his next album. Both songs were released on the Sunshine Superman album in 1966 and Donovan's Greatest Hits in 1969. The name recognition of these two songs would give the record companies marketing leverage and guarantee release. In addition to \\"Sunshine Superman\\" and \\"Season of the Witch\\", Donovan updated three other songs from his canon. Two of these songs, \\"Lady of the Stars\\" (written for Donovan's wife Linda Lawrence) and \\"Local Boy Chops Wood\\" (written about Brian Jones) were as well recorded and released on Donovan in 1977, \\"Boy for Every Girl\\" had been recorded for his 1973 album Essence to Essence. Donovan also included five new songs and titled the album Lady of the Stars for his wife Linda. Lady of the Stars was released in Britain through RCA, and licensed in the US to Allegiance Records. It became the first Donovan album to receive a US release since Donovan in 1977.

Yaghans share a series of similarities with the more northern tribes of Chonos and Alacalufe. These are a traditional canoe-faring hunter-gatherers lifestyle as well as shared physical traits such as being of short stature, being long-headed (dolichocephalic) and having a \\"low face\\".Trivero Rivera 2005, p. 42. Despite similarities, their languages were completely different.Trivero Rivera 2005, p. 33. Nomenclature and missionary contact In 1871, Anglican missionaries Thomas Bridges and George Lewis established a mission at Tierra del Fuego, where they both raised their families. Bridges had learned the language starting when he lived on Keppel Island at the age of 17. Over more than a decade, he compiled a grammar and a 30,000-word dictionary of Yaghan-English. Bridges' second son, Lucas Bridges, also learned the language and is one of the few Europeans to do so. In his 1948 book, which was a history of that period, he writes that in Yaghan, their autonym or name for themselves was yamana (meaning \\"person\\" (though modern usage is man only, not woman) – the plural is yamali(m)). The name Yaghan (originally and correctly spelled Yahgan), was first used by his father Thomas Bridges from the name of their territory, Yahgashaga, or Yahga Strait. They called themselves Yahgashagalumoala (meaning \\"people from mountain valley channel\\" -lum means 'from', -oala is a collective term for 'men', the singular being ua). It was the name of the inhabitants of the Murray Channel area (Yahgashaga), from whom Thomas Bridges first learned the language.Bridges, p. 62 The name Tekenika (), first applied to a sound in Hoste Island, simply means \\"I do not understand\\" (from teki- see and -vnnaka (v schwa) have trouble doing), and evidently originated as the answer to a misunderstood question.Bridges, p. 36 Adaptations to climate Despite the cold climate in which they lived, early Yaghan wore little to no clothing until after their extended contact with Europeans.Murphy 134 They were able to survive the harsh climate because: # They kept warm by huddling around small fires when they could, including in their boats to stay warm. The name of \\"Tierra del Fuego\\" (land of fire) was based on the many fires seen by passing European explorers. # They made use of rock formations to shelter from the elements. # They covered themselves in animal grease. # Over time, they had evolved significantly higher metabolisms than average humans, allowing them to generate more internal body heat.Murphy 140 # Their natural resting position was a deep squatting position, which reduced their surface area and helped to conserve heat.Mundo Yamana Museum exhibits, Ushuaia, Argentina Distribution of the pre-Hispanic people in the Southern Patagonia Early Yaghan people The Yaghan may have been driven to this inhospitable area by enemies to the north. They were famed for their complete indifference to the cold weather of Tierra del Fuego.Murphy 139 Although they had fire and small domed shelters, they routinely went about completely naked. Women swam in cold waters hunting for shellfish.Murphy 145 They often were observed to sleep in the open, completely unsheltered and unclothed, while Europeans shivered under blankets. A Chilean researcher claimed their average body temperature was warmer than a European's by at least one degree. A traditional Yahgan basket, woven with smoked Juncus effusus by Abuela Cristina Mateo Martinic, in Crónica de las tierras del sur del canal Beagle, asserts that there were five groups under the Yahgan people: Wakimaala on both shores of the Beagle Channel from Yendegaia to Puerto Róbalo and at the Murray Channel; Utumaala from (today) Puerto Williams to Picton Island; Inalumaala at the Beagle Channel from Punta Divide to Brecknock; Ilalumaala in the south west islands, from Cook Bay to False Cape Horn; and Yeskumaala in the Islands around the Cape Horn. The Yaghan established many temporary, but often reused, settlements within Tierra del Fuego. A significant Yaghan archaeological site from the Megalithic period has been found at Wulaia Bay. C. Michael Hogan has called it the Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens.C. Michael Hogan (2008) Bahia Wulaia Dome Middens, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham European contact Yahgan cemetery at Mejillones, Navarino Island The Yaghan left strong impressions on all who encountered them, including Ferdinand Magellan, Charles Darwin, Francis Drake, James Cook, James Weddell and Julius Popper.Murphy 132 Portuguese explorer Fernão de Magalhães came upon the area around Tierra del Fuego in the early sixteenth century, but it was not until the 19th century that Europeans started to be interested in the zone and its peoples. The Yahgan were estimated to number 3,000 persons in the mid-19th century, when Europeans started colonizing the area. The British officer Robert FitzRoy was made captain of in November 1828, and continued her first survey voyage. On the night following 28 January 1830 the ship's whaleboat was stolen by Fuegians, and over a month of fruitless searching to recover the boat he took guides and then prisoners who mostly escaped, eventually taking a man (renamed York Minster, estimated age 26) and a young girl (renamed Fuegia Basket, estimated age 9) hostage. A week later he took another youth hostage (renamed Boat Memory, estimated age 20) and on 11 May captured (estimated to be 14) Jemmy Button. As it was not possible to easily put them ashore, he decided to \\"civilise the savages.\\" He taught them \\"English..the plainer truths of Christianity..and the use of common tools\\" and took them with the return of the Beagle to England. Boat Memory died, but the others were considered \\"civilised\\" enough to be presented at court in London in the summer of 1831. On the famous second voyage of HMS Beagle, the three Fuegians were returned to their homeland along with a trainee missionary. They impressed Charles Darwin with their behaviour, in startling contrast to the \\"primitive\\" Fuegians he met when the ship reached their native lands. He described his first meeting with the native Fuegians in the islands as being > \\"without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: > I could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and > civilised man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, in > as much as in man there is a greater power of improvement.\\" In contrast, he said of the Yahgan Jemmy Button: \\"It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here.\\" The mission was set up for the three Fuegians. When the Beagle returned a year later, its crew found only Jemmy, and he had returned to his tribal ways. He readily still spoke English, assuring them that he \\"had not the least wish to return to England\\" and was \\"happy and contented\\" to live with his wife, in what the English thought a shockingly primitive manner. This encounter with the Fuegians had an important influence on Darwin's later scientific work. The Yaghan were decimated by the endemic infectious diseases carried by Westerners. The English established missions at Keppel Island in the Falklands, and Ushuaia on Tierra del Fuego, in an effort to teach the natives English, Christianity, and farming. The Yahgan suffered disruption of their habitat starting in the early-to-mid 19th century when European whalers and sealers depleted their most calorie-rich resources, forcing them to rely on mussels chopped from rocks, which provided many fewer calories for the effort needed to gather and process them, in the late 19th century when waves of immigrants came to the area for the gold rush and a boom in sheep farming. They did not understand the British concept of property, and were hunted down by ranchers' militias for the offense of \\"poaching\\" sheep in their former territories. In Sailing Alone Around the World (1900), Joshua Slocum wrote that when he sailed solo to Tierra del Fuego, European-Chileans warned him the Yaghan might rob and possibly kill him if he moored in a particular area, so he sprinkled tacks on the deck of his boat, the Spray. In the 1920s, some Yahgan were resettled on Keppel Island in the Falkland Islands in an attempt to preserve the tribe, as described by E. Lucas Bridges in Uttermost Part of the Earth (1948), but they continued to die off. The second-to-last full-blooded Yaghan, Emelinda Acuña, died in 2005. As of 2017, the last full-blooded Yahgan was \\"Abuela\\" (grandmother) Cristina Calderón, who lives in Chilean territory. She is the last native speaker of the Yahgan language.

Conner Peripherals was founded in 1985Riser, J., \\"Computer Memories Names New CEO,\\" Electronic News, September 23, 1985, p. 21. by Seagate Technology co-founder and San Jose State University alumnus Finis Conner (1943– ).Finis F. Conner, born 28 July 1943 in Gadsden, Alabama In 1986, they mergedComputer System News and Electronic News, Feb 1986 with CoData, a Colorado start-up founded by MiniScribe founders Terry Johnson and John Squires. CoData was developing a new type of small hard disk that put the capacity of a 5.25-inch drive into the smaller (and now commonplace) 3.5-inch format. The CoData drive was the first Conner Peripherals product. The company was partially financed by Compaq, who was also a major customer for many years. Conner's hard disk designsBasic concepts= Conner's drives were notable for eschewing the \\"tub\\" type of head-disk assembly, where the disks are inside a large base casting shaped like a square bowl or vault with a flat lid; instead, they preferred the flat base plate approach, which was more resistant to shock and less likely to warp or deform when heated. Their first drives had the base plate carrying the disks, head arm and actuator enclosed inside a long aluminum cartridge, fixed to a bulkhead on the other side with two screws and sealed with a large, square O-ring. Conner's 1/3-height (1-inch thick) drives used a domed, cast aluminum lid with four screws, one on each corner, sealed to the base plate with a rubber gasket. The printed circuit board was bolted to the bottom of the base plate, with the mounting holes for the drive drilled into tabs cast into the sides of the base plate. This design would be Conner's trademark look well into the 1990s. Logically, Conner's drives had some of the characteristics of the original MiniScribe drives (of which John Squires had also been a designer), with a large amount of intelligence built into the drive's central processing unit (CPU); Conner drives used a single Motorola 68HC11 microcontroller, and ran a proprietary real-time operating system that implemented the track-following algorithms (the \\"servo\\" system) in software, as well as managing the bus interface. Running these functions in software saved a lot of hardware; in 1986, most drives used a separate PID controller for the spindle, and used a CPU mainly to manage the bus interface and generate positioning pulses for a stepper motor. SCSI support added yet another CPU to interpret the SCSI commands, and track-following servos required analog components that often populated entire circuit boards of their own, thus driving up costs. Another cost-saving measure was the ability of the drive to test itself when it was initially powered on after being assembled in the factory. Unlike many competitive products, this required only a power connection, not a dedicated computer or test system. Conner Peripherals \\"Chinook\\" drive with clear top cover =Performance issues and the \\"Chinook\\" dual-actuator drive= Conner products suffered from lower performance compared to drives that had more on- board buffer memory, or those that spun the media at speeds greater than 3600 RPM, and lower capacity compared to products that utilized zone bit recording (ZBR), to which Conner was slow to adapt. To remedy this, Conner produced a limited number of dual-actuator drives (internally called \\"Chinook\\") for high- throughput applications. These drives used the SCSI interface and had two independently controlled (by the embedded microprocessor) servo and read/write systems, and two complete sets of read/write heads. The drive firmware enabled it to dynamically reorder commands and assign them to a specific read/write system for optimum execution time, and perform read-write-verify and read- exclusive or-write operations twice as fast as comparable single-actuator systems. Chinook was limited by its physical size -- internally it used 3.5-inch disks, but the external dimensions were those of much higher-capacity 5.25-inch drives. Also, RAID systems that used standard drives were dropping in price, making it simpler to use many single-actuator drives with higher capacities together rather than pay more for a smaller-capacity, dual-actuator drive. However, Conner was able to reuse parts of the design in more conventional single-actuator models, and eventually used the dual-CPU architecture to build a line of 7200-RPM drives, the CFP4207 series, in 1995. In the mid-1990s, just prior to their buyout by Seagate, Conner Peripherals started using a cost-saving measure on its low-end drives. Instead of bolted- down, cast aluminum lids with rubber gaskets, Conner Peripherals came up with a design that used a thinner stamped aluminum lid, and a thick adhesive tape seal along the perimeter of the lid, where the lip of the lid meets the base casting. This design used no screws to hold on the lid -- just cutting the tape could permanently damage the drive by making the lid come off. This design was kept well after the Seagate buyout, and was discontinued in 1999. Corporate history Conner Peripherals was founded in June 1985 and located in San Jose CA. However it did not produce any product until after it merged into and with CoData, Boulder CO, in February 1986.Conner Peripherals Prospectus, April 12, 1988 It began shipping its first products based upon the CoData design in early 1987, initially to Compaq. During calendar 1987 Compaq represented about 90% of Conner Peripheral's sales. In 1990, Conner Peripherals set a record by reaching $1.337 billion in sales in four years, without acquisitions, making it the fastest-growing manufacturing start-up in United States history.Langan, Patricia A., America's Fastest Growing Company, Fortune, August 13, 1990 Conner Peripherals were also one of the first companies to produce IDE specification AV (audio/visual) hard drives for a low cost, such as the 420 megabyte AV in 1995-1996, and was the first to produce drives with a native (no external adapter) IEEE 1394 FireWire interface. The company also started manufacturing tape drives in 1993, when it purchased Archive Corporation. In 1996, Conner Peripherals was acquired by Seagate. Further reading * Pollack, Andrew.

The current company is the result of the 2020 amalgamation of The Great-West Life Assurance Company, London Life Insurance Company and The Canada Life Assurance Company, along with their holding companies (London Insurance Group Inc. and Canada Life Financial Corporation). The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Great-West Lifeco.  History and ownership Great-West Life Assurance Company= Former Great-West Life building in Winnipeg (on right) The Great-West Life Assurance Company (French: La Great- West, Compagnie d'Assurance-vie) provided life, disability, and health insurance; benefit and retirement plans; and investment advice. It was active in both the United States and Canada. Great-West Life was founded in Winnipeg in 1891 by Jeffry Hall Brock, a local insurance agent. The company was incorporated on August 28, 1891, with local residents such as James Ashdown on its board. In 1942, it was the first Canadian company \\"to enter the accident and health insurance business.\\" In 1960, the company moved to Osborne Street, where it had constructed a new building on the site of the old Osborne Stadium. In 1983, the company expanded into a building on the corner of Broadway and Osborne. In 1979, US and Canadian operations were separated due mostly to rapid US growth. In 1969, Great-West was purchased by the Power Corporation, which made it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, Great-West began offering a universal life policy which differed from those offered by competitors. Two years later, in 1984, the Power Financial Corporation was created as a holding company for Great-West and its numerous businesses. Great-West Life Realty (GWL Realty) is the Toronto-based property and asset management arm of Great-West Life, established in 1993. =London Life Insurance Company= The London Life Insurance Company (or London Life) merged with Great-West Life in 1997, then joined the original Canada Life in 2003. London Life was a part of Great-West Lifeco subsidiary, Great-West Life Assurance Company. London Life was founded in London, Ontario, in 1874, and remains headquartered there. In 2009, London Life ranked 14th among Canada's largest private companies. It is best known for its \\"Freedom 55\\" slogan, which evokes saving money to an extent that would allow one to retire at age 55. The company reportedly had assets under management of $40 billion (Canadian funds) as at December 31, 2004, and 1.9 million participating life insurance policies. London Life merged with its sister companies, Great-West Life Assurance Company and Canada Life Financial, under the new brand and the banner of Canada Life. =Canada Life Financial Corporation= First offices of the Canada Life Assurance Company, Toronto, 1888 Hugh Cossart Baker Sr. established the Canada Life Assurance Company (CLAC), the first life insurance company in Canada, on 21 August 1847. The firm was incorporated in 1849. The company was acquired by Great-West Life Assurance Company in 2003, after rejecting a hostile takeover bid by rival Manulife. Canada Life Financial had offices in the United Kingdom; in Ireland; Germany; Brazil; the United States; and on the Isle of Man. The first CLAC head office was in Hamilton, Ontario on the top floor of the Mechanics' Institute on James Street near Merrick, where the Hamilton City Centre (formerly the Eaton's Centre) now stands. The head office moved in 1883 to King Street East and Hughson Street South (later known as the Birks Building). The company commissioned the building of the Canada Life Building, which was completed in 1895, in Montreal. The headquarters of CLAC was moved to Toronto in 1900 by newly installed company president, George Cox, father of telephone pioneer Hugh Baker. From 1926 to 1929, the company was headquartered at historic Cawthra House in Toronto. Several acquisitions were made and sister companies founded through the years, including: ;Crown Life Insurance Company of Canada Crown Life was founded in 1900 and was based in Toronto. It was acquired by CLAC in 1998. ;Canada Life, UK Canada Life began operations in the United Kingdom in 1903. Parent companies Great- West Lifeco is a joint-stock corporation traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and owns 100% of The Great-West Life Assurance Company. Power Financial Corporation (PFC) is the majority stake-holder and owns 72% of Great-West Lifeco, the only one of those finance companies to be a member of the stock exchange composite index. Other operating companies include Irish Life, Great- West Financial, and Putnam Investments. In 2003, Great-West Lifeco acquired Canada Life Financial, which later emerged, along with Great-West Life Assurance Company, for US$4.7 billion. Great-West Life sold its health insurance US division to Cigna for US$1.5 billion in a deal announced on November 26, 2007. Great-West was seeking to expand into the western United States. Merger and consolidation The Canada Life Building in Toronto, 2005 In 2019, Great-West Lifeco consolidated its three brands in Canada as \\"Canada Life\\". In April 2019, Great-West Life merged with its sister companies London Life and Canada Life into the single brand of Canada Life. The rebrand will take place in 2020, with Canada Life going to have 10,500 employees. The Canada Life amalgamation received approval from the Canadian government in November 2019. They officially begin operating as the Canada Life Assurance Company on January 1, 2020. Canada Life is based in Toronto, Ontario at the historic Canada Life Building on University Avenue. Employees of the merged companies work from five regional offices in Winnipeg, London, Toronto, Montreal and Regina. Paul A. Mahon is president. Canada Life is on the Canada's Top 100 Employers and Top 100 Employers for Young people lists.  Philanthropy  On May 28, 2017, sister companies Canada Life, London Life and Great-West Life contributed $25,000 to Canadian Red Cross to help people affected by extensive Spring flooding in Canada. In May 2017, Canada Life (then Great-West Life), along with the Investors Group and the Power Corporation of Canada, announced a commitment of $12 million to the University of Manitoba to establish an Institute for Leadership Development.NOTE: On June 4, 2019, at the University of Manitoba's annual spring convocation, it was announced that the U of M leadership institute would be named for Burns. In February 2020, the corporation established the \\"James W. Burns 'Founder Endowment Fund' \\" after the late James W. Burns, former president and chief executive officer at Great-West Life. In April 2019, the Manitoba Museum announced a donation of $750,000.00 to their capital campaign, \\"Bringing Our Stories Forward\\", by Canada Life. The donation was made in honour of Burns. Canada Life donated 470 tickets for the \\"A Conversation with Michelle Obama\\" event to the Winnipeg School Division,. The company has been a long-term sponsor of \\"Future Leaders of Manitoba\\" awards. Notable recipients of the award have included indigenous Peoples activist Michael Redhead Champagne, Canadian politician Kevin Chief, Canadian film director Adam Smoluk, community leader Hannah Pratt, surgeon and university associate professor Dr. Jordan Hochman, president of Manitoba SwimAbility, Cameron Krisko, and young philanthropist Ben Sabic. Legal proceedings Canada Life–UK claimed its former employee, Domenico Iacono, had illegally removed confidential information after he quit the job. The insurance group brought legal proceedings against Iacono before the High Court. Canada Life Financial was sued by Vanessa Valentyne after refusing to pay out her missing son's insurance policy. The policy he took out had an exclusionary clause, according to which the company will not pay on a policy if death is a result of its holder's criminal activity. Valentyne's son was a drug dealer for six years before his January 7, 2013 disappearance from a drug dealing house.

It can be used as clothing for bedridden patients. Utility Hospital gowns worn by patients are designed so that hospital staff can easily access the part of the patient's body being treated. The hospital gown is made of fabric that can withstand repeated laundering in hot water, usually cotton, and is fastened at the back with twill tape ties. Disposable hospital gowns may be made of paper or thin plastic, with paper or plastic ties. Some gowns have snaps along the top of the shoulder and sleeves, so that the gown can be removed without disrupting intravenous lines in the patient's arms. Used paper hospital gowns are associated with hospital infections, which could be avoided by proper disposal. A Canadian study surveying patients at five hospitals determined 57 percent could have worn more clothing below the waist, but only 11 percent wore more than a gown. The physicians conducting the survey said gowns should not be required unless they are necessary. Although they are cheaper and easier to wash, Dr. Todd Lee, of Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, said gowns are not necessary unless the patient is incontinent or has an injury in the lower body. Otherwise, Lee said, pajamas or regular clothes may be acceptable. Problems and redesign Many patients feel that hospital gowns are unfashionable. Joel Sherman in his blog \\"Adolescent Boys and Genital Exams Reducing Embarrassment\\" says it is quite common for many teenage boys to be upset when changing into a hospital gown, especially if the wearer associates the look of the gown to women's clothing, women's nightgowns, or lingerie. Studies had been done on updating the garment first used when most patients had to stay in bed, but not designed for modesty when patients got out of bed. NCSU professor Traci Lamar said, \\"\\"Now doctors want patients up and walking quickly.\\" Still, traditional gowns could be washed many times and could be handled a lot. New style gowns and other types of clothing can be more expensive. The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey reported a $70,000 a year increase. =Luke's FastBreaks= When 9-year-old Luke Lange complained about wearing a hospital gown when being treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma, his mother adapted some t-shirts for him to wear, using snap tape on the sides. Other children saw the t-shirt and wanted one too. Two years later, the organization Luke's FastBreaks had raised $1 million for children's cancer and given out over 5000 of the t-shirts. They were long enough to wear like the gowns, but some preferred to wear them like t-shirts. Briton Lynn, executive director of Luke's FastBreaks, said the t-shirts helped children have a more positive attitude. =Traci Lamar design= In November 2006, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave a $236,000 grant to a team at North Carolina State University to design a new gown based on \\"style, cost, durability, comfort, function\\" and other qualities. NCSU professor Lamar's team worked to come up with a \\"more comfortable, less revealing\\" design. Surveys found that nurses did not like the ties in the back because knots could form, and some patients wore more than one gown at once, with one tied in front and the other in back. Many patients disliked how lightweight gowns were. In April 2009, the NCSU team showed potential new designs at a reception, and they were preparing to ask for more funding as they developed a prototype. Meanwhile, some hospitals were offering alternatives, including gowns that opened in the front or on the side, and drawstring pants, cotton tops and boxers. These cost more than traditional gowns. Lamar's additional funding came from RocketHub. At NCSU Fashion Week in 2013, Lamar's design was mentioned as \\"functional and dignified,\\" but not shown \\"to prevent any patent infringements\\". A prototype, made of DermaFabric and made at Precision Fabrics in Greensboro, North Carolina, was to be tested at WakeMed. =BCS gown= In 2009, Fatima Ba-Alawi was honored for her DCS (dignity, comfort, safety) gown at a RCN conference on London. Four years after she started using her skills making dresses to redesign hospital gowns, NHS trusts were using the design. The reversible gowns have plastic poppers which make it easier to change without moving the patient and save staff time, and side pockets for drips or catheters, along with a pouch for cardio equipment. One version called the Faith Gown has a detachable head scarf and long sleeves. =Ben de Lisi design= Another redesign in England came from Ben de Lisi, one of six receiving grants. The Design Council was scheduled to show his design, which did not open in the back but did allow access, in March 2010. According to the BBC, de Lisi's hospital gowns are made much more modestly, taking patient dignity into consideration. =Cleveland Clinic design= The Cleveland Clinic changed its gowns in 2010 because the CEO had heard many complaints. Diane von Furstenberg was commissioned to design stylish hospital gowns based on her fashionable wrap dress by the Cleveland Clinic. The new design was reversible with a V-neck in both the front and the back, with softer fabric. =Dignity Giving Suit= Birmingham Children's Hospital in England introduced the polyester/cotton Dignity Giving Suit in March 2013, after 18 months of work. Patients and health care professionals liked the suits with Velcro fasteners on the seams. Other area hospitals were interested. Adults wanted the gowns to be made for them as well as children. =Janice Fredrickson= A design patented in 2014 by Janice Fredrickson had a side opening and sleeve openings, and could be put on without the patient sitting up. One version had pockets for telemetry wires and for drainage bags. It was suggested that different colors be used for different patients, such as those at risk of falling. =Model G design= In 2015, Henry Ford Health System of Detroit was working on its own design, similar to a bathrobe with cotton blend. In tests, patients liked the new design. But any update was likely to cost more, as well as harder to take care of. The Model G design, to be made by Carhartt of Michigan, used snaps on the front and shoulders.

His novels, The Outward Room (1938) and Savage Sleep (1968), addressed mental health institutions and were bestsellers in their day. Private life Brand was born on January 19, 1906, in Jersey City, New Jersey, into a working-class family. He was of Pennsylvania Dutch descent on his mother’s side. He graduated from Columbia University in 1929. He resided in Greenwich Village and on a small farm in Bally, Pennsylvania. He married twice; first to Pauline Leader, a poet noted for her memoir about growing up deaf, And No Birds Sing, and then to Helen Mendelssohn; both marriages ended in divorce. He had three children by his first marriage and one by his second. Career After graduating from Columbia, Brand began work as a psychiatric aide and also a copywriter for the New York Telephone Company before accepting faculty posts at the University of New Hampshire and New York University, where he taught writing fiction. Brand was an editor at Crown Publishers for about twenty years, starting in the early 1950s, where he edited works by Indian social-realist novelist Bhabani Bhattacharya. In 1935, Brand joined the League of American Writers (1935-1943), whose members included Alexander Trachtenberg, Frank Folsom, Louis Untermeyer, I.F. Stone, Myra Page, Arthur Miller, Lillian Hellman, and Dashiell Hammett. Members were sympathetic to the U.S. Communist Party.Earl Browder, \\"Text of Speech by Browder at American Writers Congress,\\" The Daily Worker, vol. 12, no. 102 (April 29, 1935), pg. 3. In 1937, Brand wrote his first and most noted novel, The Outward Room, based in part on his experience as a psychiatric aide. The novel was a bestseller and was adapted for Broadway as The World We Make. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Writing (Screenplay) in 1948 for The Snake Pit (with Frank Partos), an adaptation of Mary Jane Ward's novel, which like his novel, The Outward Room, involved confinement in a mental health institution. Brand described the Pennsylvania Dutch culture in Fields of Peace: A Pennsylvania German Album (1970)—with photography by George Tice—and in Local Lives (1975), a book of poems about his Pennsylvania Dutch neighbors, compiled over the span of his working life.  Activism  Brand was active in the peace movement. Toward the end of his life, he was active in a movement to open up major poetry publications to writers of color and younger writers, through his friendship with the Caribbean-American poet, essayist, teacher, and activist, June Jordan. In 1953, Brand was required to appear before the U.S. Senate Investigations subcommittee, chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy, at which appearance he refused to testify against his colleagues in the League of American Writers, citing the Fifth Amendment. Consequently, his works were among those banned from U.S. State Department libraries, abroad.

This theory, created and developed mostly by Tendai monks, was never systematized, but was nonetheless very pervasive and very influential.* The book had thereafter great influence over literature and the arts. History The book is believed to have been written during the late Nanboku-chō period, either during the Bunna or the Enbun era. It carries the note but who exactly wrote it is unclear. Divided in ten volumes and 50 chapters, it supports the Tendai and Ise Shinto honji suijaku theory according to which Japanese kami were simply local manifestations of the Indian gods of Buddhism. This theory was never systematized, but became nonetheless the most important tool through which foreign Buddhism was reconciled with local kami beliefs. The book illustrates it through tales dedicated to various shrines and to the Buddhist gods which are the true nature of the kami they enshrine. It deals mostly with shrines located west of Tonegawa in Kōzuke province (like Akagi Daimyōjin, Ikaho Daimyōjin and Komochiyama Daimyōjin), the Kumano Sanzan and other Kantō shrines, explaining the reason for their kami's rebirths, and telling tales about their previous lives. The common point of the tales is that, before being reborn as a tutelary kami of an area, a person has first to be born and suffer there as a human being. The suffering is mostly caused by relationships with relatives, especially wives or husbands. The book had a great impact on the literature and arts of the following centuries.

She was one of the most widely read and highest paid female writers in the United States for nearly fifty years, from 1911 to 1959. Norris was a prolific writer who wrote 93 novels, many of which became best sellers. Her stories appeared frequently in the popular press of the day, including The Atlantic, The American Magazine, McClure's, Everybody's, Ladies' Home Journal, and Woman's Home Companion. Norris used her fiction to promote family and moralistic values, such as the sanctity of marriage, the nobility of motherhood, and the importance of service to others. Life and career Kathleen Thompson Norris was born in San Francisco, California on July 16, 1880. Her parents were Josephine (née Moroney) and James Alden Thompson. When she was 19 both her parents died. As the oldest sibling she became effectively the head of a large family and had to work. Initially, she found employment in a department store, which was soon followed by work in an accounting office and then the Mechanic's Institute Library. In 1905, she enrolled in a creative writing program at the University of California, Berkeley and began writing short stories. The San Francisco Call, which had published a few of her stories, hired her to write a society column in September 1906. In the course of that work she met Charles Gilman Norris (whose late older brother was the famous novelist Frank Norris), and they soon fell in love. He moved to New York to be art editor of The American Magazine. After eight months of daily correspondence and some improvements in her family's financial situation, she joined him there and they were married in April 1909. She resumed writing short stories, which began to appear in newspapers and then magazines starting in 1910. Charles took on a lifelong role as Kathleen's literary agent, and also took care of many household management roles as she became increasingly successful as a writer. Shortly after becoming a new mother, she wrote her first novel, Mother. It started as a short story in The American Magazine in 1911. A publisher asked her to expand it into a novelette, which became a national sensation and earned the praise of Theodore Roosevelt for its celebration of large families. A devout Catholic, she wrote the book in part as a commentary against birth control, which was rapidly influencing women's attitudes about motherhood. Her 1914 novel Saturday's Child received a positive, lengthy review from William Dean Howells, who remarked on her sensitivity to class issues. Norris became involved in various social causes, including women's suffrage, Prohibition, pacifism, and organizations to benefit children and the poor. Norris is pictured at an America First Committee rally in 1941 at Madison Square Garden giving what appears to be a Nazi salute. There is controversy over whether she was giving the Nazi salute. People reciting the pledge of allegiance sometimes made a gesture with an outstretched arm and the palm up, as opposed to the Nazi salute with the palm down. (More recent commenters sometimes call this gesture the \\"Bellamy salute,\\" but according to the literary scholar Sarah Churchwell, the \\"Bellamy salute\\" refers to the language of the pledge rather than any gestures accompanying it.) Contemporary sources described Norris's salute as \\"closer to the Nazi salute\\" than to accepted methods of saluting the American flag. At this rally, which took place in May 1941, Norris is pictured with Charles A. Lindbergh and Senator Burton K. Wheeler. Many of her novels were made into films, including Butterfly (1924), My Best Girl (1927), The Callahans and the Murphys (1927), Passion Flower (1930), and Change of Heart (1934, based on the novel Manhattan Love Song). Some of Norris's novels were adapted for a radio series, By Kathleen Norris, making her \\"the first nationally famous writer to have her works brought to radio listeners as a daily serial program.\\" The program, produced by Phillips Lord, was broadcast on CBS October 9, 1939 – September 26, 1941. Kathleen Thompson Norris died January 18, 1966, in San Francisco at the home of her son Dr. Frank Norris. She was 85. Family In 1919 the family moved to a ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains near Saratoga, California, adjacent to the Villa Montalvo estate of James Duval Phelan. They later built a house in Palo Alto and spent summers at the ranch. Kathleen's sister Teresa, who had married William Rose Benét and borne three children, died in 1919. Kathleen fought for and eventually obtained guardianship of the two nieces and a nephew: Rosemary, Kathleen Anne and James Benét. Her granddaughter Kathleen Norris (1935–1967) was the second wife of Prince Andrew Romanov.

Kyle is sent to Nurse Gollum, only to discover that she has a dead fetus attached to her head, due to a condition called conjoined twin myslexia. Kyle tells the others and they react in disgust, making fun of her. Kyle's mother, Sheila, attempts to educate the boys on Nurse Gollum's condition, but is confronted by an irate Sharon Marsh. Sheila, in order to remedy the unawareness apparent in people of conjoined twin myslexia, decides to help the woman, and winds up causing a \\"Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week\\" declared in South Park for its sole sufferer. Meanwhile, the school dodgeball team becomes eligible for competitions, and goes on to fight the state competition in Denver. South Park ends up winning because Pip becomes filled with rage whenever others bully him, giving him the strength to take down the other team. In the national competition, the Washington, D.C. team forfeits because of their fear of the inevitable international opponent, China, who are brutal and merciless at dodgeball. In China, the team is dismantled until Pip is the only one left. After they are tricked into teasing him, Pip single-handedly annihilates the entire Chinese team with one throw, but by this point, everyone has decided they do not want to play dodgeball anymore since even Kenny gets killed by China's team. In South Park, after a week of festivities, a parade is held for Nurse Gollum to give a speech.

According to the 2010 census, there were 1,181 Chelkans in Russia.  History  The Chelkans emerged from the mixing of Turkic clans with Ket, Samoyed, and other native Siberian groups. This was a process that began as early as the period when the Yenisei Kygryz dominated the region. The Mongols then ruled over the region and people from the 13th to 18th centuries. The Dzungars than briefly controlled the area until the Chelkans (along with other Altaians) submitted to the Russians.  Culture  The Chelkans were originally hunters and animals living in the taiga were their main prey and were vital to the local subsistence economy.

The two anterior cerebral arteries arise from the internal carotid artery and are part of the circle of Willis. The left and right anterior cerebral arteries are connected by the anterior communicating artery. Anterior cerebral artery syndrome refers to symptoms that follow a stroke occurring in the area normally supplied by one of the arteries. It is characterized by weakness and sensory loss in the lower leg and foot opposite to the lesion and behavioral changes. Structure Arteries of the brain. Anterior cerebral artery labeled at the left The anterior cerebral artery is divided into 5 segments. Its smaller branches: the callosal (supracallosal) arteries are considered as the A4 and A5 segments. *A1 originates from the internal carotid artery and extends to the anterior communicating artery (AComm). The anteromedial central (medial lenticulostriate) arteries arise from this segment as well as the AComm, which irrigates the caudate nucleus and the anterior limb of the internal capsule *A2 extends from the AComm to the bifurcation forming the pericallosal and callosomarginal arteries. The recurrent artery of Heubner (distal medial striate artery), which irrigates the internal capsule, usually arises at the beginning of this segment near the AComm. Two branches arise from this segment: **Orbitofrontal artery (medial frontal basal): Arises a small distance away from the AComm **Frontopolar artery (polar frontal): Arises after the orbitofrontal, close to the curvature of A2 over the corpus callosum. It can also originate from the callosal marginal. *A3, also termed the pericallosal artery, is one of the (or the only) main terminal branches of the ACA, which extends posteriorly in the pericallosal sulcus to form the internal parietal arteries (superior, inferior) and the precuneal artery. This artery may form an anastomosis with the posterior cerebral artery. **Callosal marginal artery: A commonly present terminal branch of the ACA, which bifurcates from the pericallosal artery. This artery in turn branches into the medial frontal arteries (anterior, intermediate, posterior), and the paracentral artery, with the cingulate branches arising throughout its length. Depending on anatomical variation, the callosal marginal artery may be none discrete or not be visible. In the latter case, the branches mentioned will originate from the pericallosal artery. In a study of 76 hemispheres, the artery was present in only 60% of the cases. Angiography studies cite that the vessel can be seen 67% or 50% of the time. =Development= The anterior cerebral artery develops from a primitive anterior division of the internal carotid artery that initially supplies the optic and olfactory regions. This anterior division, which appears at the twenty-eighth day of development, also forms the middle cerebral artery and the anterior choroidal artery. The anterior cerebral arteries grow toward each other and form the anterior communicating artery at the 21–24 mm stage of the embryo. =Variation= The anterior cerebral artery shows considerable variation. In a study made using MRA, the most common variation was an underdeveloped A1 segment (5.6%), followed by the presence of an extra A2 segment (3%). In 2% of cases there was only one A2 segment. Function The anterior cerebral artery supplies a part of the frontal lobe, specifically its medial surface and the upper border. It also supplies the front four–fifths of the corpus callosum, and provides blood to deep structures such as the anterior limb of the internal capsule, part of the caudate nucleus, and the anterior part of the globus pallidus. Clinical significance Areas of the brain supplied by left anterior cerebral artery (represented in green color) =Occlusion= Strokes that occur in a part of the artery prior to the anterior communicating usually do not produce many symptoms because of collateral circulation. If a blockage occurs in the A2 segment or later, the following signs and symptoms may be noted: * Paralysis or weakness of the foot and leg on the opposite side, due to involvement of leg part of the motor cortex * Cortical sensory loss in the opposite foot and leg * Gait apraxia (impairment of gait and stance) * Abulia, akinetic mutism, slowness and lack of spontaneity * Urinary incontinence which usually occurs with bilateral damage in the acute phase * Frontal cortical release reflexes: Contralateral grasp reflex, sucking reflex, paratonic rigidity Additional images File:Circle of Willis 5.jpgAnterior cerebral artery File:Sobo 1909 3 548.pngCerebral arteries seen from beneath.

As with most media in Canada, the television industry, and the television programming available in that country, are strongly influenced by media in the United States, perhaps to an extent not seen in any other major industrialized nation. As a result, the government institutes quotas for \\"Canadian content\\". Nonetheless, new content is often aimed at a broader North American audience, although the similarities may be less pronounced in the predominantly French-language province of Quebec. History Development of television = The first experimental television broadcast began in 1932 in Montreal, Quebec, under the call sign of VE9EC. The broadcasts of VE9EC were broadcast in 60 to 150 lines of resolution at 41 MHz. This service closed around 1935, and the outbreak of World War II put a halt to television experiments. Television in Canada on major networks pre-date any telecasts that originated in the country since thousands of television sets that were capable of receiving U.S.-based signals were installed in homes near the Canada–US border between 1946 and 1953. Homes in southern and southwestern Ontario and portions of British Columbia, including the Toronto, Hamilton, London, Windsor, Victoria and Vancouver areas, were able to receive television stations from Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit or Seattle with the help of elevated outdoor antennas and amplifiers. U.S. television programs and the networks that originated them thus became popular in those Canadian cities within range of their signals, and those cities represented a sizable proportion of the total Canadian population. This helped spur development of a specifically Canadian television programming and transmission system during the late 1940s and early 1950s, but at the same time caused it to develop within American technical standards that had been previously mandated by the Federal Communications Commission between 1941 and 1946. Since the first Canadian stations (CBFT in Montreal and CBLT in Toronto) signed on in September 1952, television developed differently in Canada than in the United States because it was introduced and developed in a different context. The distinct social, political, and economic situation of Canada shaped the historic development of mass communication and television in the country. Three factors have made the historical development of television in Canada a unique one: The threat of American influence, the language divide, and the government's response to both of these. American influence and the fear of that influence greatly affected television's development in Canada. The first decades of the 20th century saw a change towards industrialization, and during that time both the materials and products manufactured as well as the investors and consumers were American.Filion, Michel. \\"Broadcasting and cultural identity: the Canadian experience\\". Media, Culture & Society 18, 3 (1996): 447–467. The Canadian dependency on American capital and markets persisted through the Great Depression and its aftermath. This situation remained during the emergence of television and affected its development in Canada. Even with the emergence of radio, Canada was already trying to keep foreign ownership and programming at a minimum to avoid the American imperialism that would be caused by such dependency on the United States, which in fact was already incipient. The issue of economy of scale played a large role. \\"Americans [were] pushing smaller cultural communication aside with their dominating programming, not because they [were] based on a policy but because they ha[d] the money – the poorer the country, the more American productions.\\"Raboy, Marc. \\"Canadian Broadcasting, Canadian Nationhood: Two Concepts, Two Solitudes, and Great Expectations\\". After Meech Lake: Lessons for the Future. 1991. English Canadian broadcasting illustrated how this was problematic for some Anglophone Canadians as well as the Canadian government. A major question was how any sense of \\"Canadianism\\" could come out of such an attractive (and rich) American world. There was a fear of communicating ideas and opinions that were not Canadian, to Canadians - especially the youth.Filion, 447–467. With the exception of radio, television presented an opportunity, for the first time, to reach a very wide audience at the same time. By 1954, a million television sets had been sold in Canada. Even though those sets were very expensive at the time, the large majority (9 of 10) of Canadian households owned a television set by the end of the 1950s.Cole, Stephen. \\"Here's Looking At Us: Celebrating Fifty Years of CBC–TV\\". Canada: The Canadian Publishers, 2002, 6. People became excited and obsessed with the novelty. Television performer and producer Lorne Michaels said, about the advent of television, \\"it was all we talked about at school. We literally raced home to watch TV\\".Cole, 6. It became important to Canada that Canadian values would be projected onto this large audience and then onto the entire nation. Although many watched the available American television programs, some feared that Canada would end up stuck in a rut of American popular culture during a time when Canadian national identity was very vague. Canada was not only made up of Francophones and Anglophones, there were also immigrants from around the world, at that time mostly from Europe. That fear of American influence convinced the Canadian government that its involvement was necessary in order for Canadian broadcasting to express and encourage Canadian identity and national unity. Though French Canadians feared expansion of American influence and the difficulties that might arise in protecting the French language, their concern was not the same as that of English Canadians who did not have the option of purchasing U.S. programming and profitably filled their schedules with cheaper, attractive foreign programming, mostly because they were not attractive to the French audience. In this situation, society affected the division in the Canadian broadcasting industry as much as the division affected society. The intensity of fears of \\"continentalism\\" was as strong as its opposing force of attractiveness of American television programs to Canadian viewers.Collins, 43. Most Anglophone viewers could relate easily to the American programs as much as they did to their Canadian programs, since people looked the same and spoke in the same language as they did. For example, in 1957, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation presented American programs such as The Ed Sullivan Show.Filion, 458. However, the ten most popular programs on French television were made in Quebec, including La Famille Plouffe. Gradually, French Canadians showed a strong preference for Quebec-produced television programs, which was significant considering the fierce American competition that English Canada dealt with (and still deals with to this day). French television was distinct from English television in that \\"one of its most distinctive aspects was the bringing together of international and local influences, American and European television styles and programming ideas and merging them with the cultural idioms of rapidly modernizing and assertive Quebec.\\"Tigkos, Marie. \\"Media, Culture and Social Change in Quebec: The Story of Radio\\"—Studies at Concordia University, National Library of Canada, 1998, 105. The merging of local and foreign ideas and techniques was a novelty in North American television. Since English and French language television in Canada had developed separately, French-language broadcasting developed a distinct popular culture. With the fear of the United States stunting the growth of Canada as well as the country becoming increasingly divided by language, the government showed huge concern with how television affected Canadians. Graham Spry, founder and spokesperson of the Canadian Radio League, stated about the radio system: \\"The question is the State or the United States.\\"Filion, 450. According to the Canadian government, the survival of Canadian television depended on public funding for Canadian programs, which would be produced, broadcast and controlled by a public corporation. The Broadcasting Act of 1932 began of government involvement.Filion, 453. Its main aim was the \\"Canadianization of mass media\\".Filion, 453 In other words, it wanted to create a Canadian broadcasting system to replace the American system that had infiltrated itself into Canada, as well as to unite Canadians in creating a national identity. The Broadcasting Act of 1932 created a national network for each electronic medium in Canada's two official languages, French and English. When it was created, the Act referred mostly to radio broadcasting but it also included television once TV came to the country in 1952. The Act resulted in the creation of the CRBC, which would be replaced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in a later revision.Filion, 454. The government-created corporation held the responsibility of establishing a national service and to monitor the entire broadcast system.Raboy, 157. Because of Canada's large land area, it would be difficult for one corporation to control the broadcasting system throughout the country, all while establishing a network to compete in that system as well as in the American system. Before 1958, Canadian law prohibited the creation of private television networks. Private stations did emerge but could not exist independently, and were obliged to become affiliated with the French national network or the English national network. The Act of 1958 as well as its revised version in 1968 allowed for the existence of privatized networks. The private stations were then recognized as direct competitors to the CBC, which maintained its role as national broadcaster but lost its regulatory power.Filion, 459. The 1968 Broadcasting Act created the Canadian Radio- Television Commission (now the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission).Collins, 69. The government still referred to the Canadian broadcasting system as the \\"single system\\".Filion, 13 Among other concerns, this implied that both private and public networks were working toward the same goals, notably the national objective of unity and Canadian content and ownership. Government intervention helped the Canadian broadcasting industry economically but failed to create a distinct culture that was in sharp contrast to American popular culture. However, it did allow Quebec to run its own broadcasting service and economically, it helped out the Canadian broadcasters, particularly the Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB).Collins, 73. Due to their protests, Bill C-58 was passed. Among many changes, Bill C-58 removed tax deductibility benefits for Canadian Corporations advertising on American stations. The 1968 Act had also given priority carriage for Canadian broadcast services.Collins, 75. Policies such as these produced important economic benefits for Canadian broadcasters. Economic prosperity for Canadian broadcasters took priority over Canadian identity in that prosperity was not compromised for identity. This can be inferred through the vagueness and ineffective policies passed in the aim of protecting Canadian culture. For example, Canadian content regulations were introduced in 1959 and revised again in 1978. \\"Canadian content\\" is broadly defined as programs of \\"general interest to Canadians\\". Since Canadians easily identify with Americans and their popular culture as well as the two countries being tied very closely on an economic standpoint, almost anything produced in the U.S. could be considered to be of general interest to Canadians. Changes to this were attempted in the late 1980s. Government intervention throughout the development of television in Canada affected the way it was developed domestically as it did not developed through laws and policies rather than a free market. =Broadcast television = While American television stations, including affiliates of ABC, NBC and CBS, near the Canada–US border were available for several years prior, and gained a sizable audience in cities like Toronto, within range of U.S. signals, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) was the first entity to broadcast television programming within Canada, launching in September 1952 in both Montreal and Toronto. Private CBC affiliates began operating late in 1953 to supplement the Corporation's own stations; the first private CBC affiliate in Canada was CKSO-TV in Sudbury, Ontario in October of that year, with CFPL-TV in London, Ontario following a few weeks later. All television stations that signed on in Canada were required to be CBC affiliates, as the CBC was the only television network operating in Canada at the time. In 1948, there were 325 television sets in Canada, but thousands more were sold in the years from 1948 to 1952, most of them tuned to stations from either the Buffalo, Seattle, Cleveland or Detroit television markets. When Canadian television began, the Radio- Television Manufacturers Association of Canada estimated that 85,000 sets were expected to be sold in 1952. 95% of these were concentrated in Ontario, with 57.4% in the Golden Horseshoe region (40.2% in Toronto and Hamilton, 17.2% in Niagara Peninsula) and 34.6% in the Windsor region near Detroit. Television viewership outside Ontario was limited to British Columbia's Lower Mainland with access to American programming from Seattle and some sets in Montreal. Television sales were promoted not only by the arrival of CBC Television, but by revised credit practices at that time, which allowed purchases without requiring an initial cash deposit. Following a review by the Diefenbaker government in the late 1950s, a number of new, \\"second\\" stations were licensed in many major markets, many of which began operating before the end of 1960. CTV, the first private network, which grew out of the inevitable association of these new stations, began operating in October 1961. About the same time, CHCH-TV in Hamilton disaffiliated from the CBC and became the first station not affiliated with either network, not counting the initial launch period of most of the soon-to-be CTV stations. Over the next 25 years or so, many more new stations were launched, primarily CBC stations in major markets replacing private affiliates (which subsequently joined with CTV or became independent) and new independent stations in the largest centres, such as CITY-TV in Toronto, CITV-TV in Edmonton, and CKND-TV in Winnipeg. During this time cable television also began to take hold, securing the fortunes of individuals such as Ted Rogers, who secured the licences for much of Toronto. In 1966, CHCH in Hamilton formed the nucleus of the first serious attempt to form Canada's third terrestrial television network.\\"TV satellite plan pie in the sky, communications firms tell BBG\\". The Globe and Mail, March 8, 1967. The original plan was withdrawn for regulatory and financial reasons by 1969,\\"Satellite in plans for third network\\". The Globe and Mail, April 22, 1970. but a scaled-down version resulted in the 1974 launch of CKGN-TV in Toronto, whose branding as Global Television Network would eventually extend nationwide. Through the 1970s and 1980s, nearly every major Canadian market saw the launch of independent third stations, most of which were either launched by or eventually acquired by Izzy Asper's Canwest, and which served as a de facto third network although they were not yet branded or formally structured as such; these stations, by and large, were eventually unified as the Global Television Network. The 1980s and 1990s saw exponential growth in the multichannel universe, beginning with pay television services and later continuing with various waves of specialty services, usually launched in one fell swoop. The launch of direct-to-home satellite television services in the mid-1990s accelerated this growth. The early- to mid-1990s in particular also saw further growth and consolidation of broadcast television. Baton Broadcasting, owner of Toronto CTV affiliate CFTO-TV and already seen as the network's dominant player, bought or replaced most of the network's other affiliates and ultimately acquired the network itself. In 1997, Asper's regional networks became united under the Global Television Network brand previously used only by his Ontario station. Additional groups also sprouted up in the form of Western International Communications, CHUM Limited and Craig Media. In 2000, CanWest bought WIC, which had itself grown from the CTV affiliate-owner in British Columbia to include many of the stations of Allarcom and Maclean Hunter, in order to satisfy its long-held desire to enter Alberta, but also giving it a second network. CHUM secured two regional services in Ontario before expanding to British Columbia and merging with Craig, its equivalent in the Canadian Prairies. The early 2000s, aside from the completion of the consolidation described above, brought an apparent convergence craze among the major media conglomerates. CanWest bought the Southam newspaper chain, including the leading broadsheet papers in several major cities, raising new concerns on media concentration. Telecom giant BCE, believing it needed control over content to fuel its new media strategy, formed Bell Globemedia, essentially CTV and its specialty services put together with a single, if influential, newspaper, The Globe and Mail. Canwest continues to pursue its strategy; in late 2005, BCE announced it would sell most of its interests in Globemedia to a consortium of investors including the Thomson family and Torstar, although it still retains a minority stake in the company. In many respects, particularly since the consolidation phase of the late 1990s and early 2000s the television industry in Canada now more closely resembles the British or Australian models, in which the vast majority of stations are directly owned by their networks and offer only slight variance in local scheduling apart from local or regional newscasts, rather than the American network affiliate model that formerly predominated. In some cases, in fact, a single station serves an entire province (or even multiple provinces, in the case of the Maritimes) through a network of rebroadcasters rather than through multiple licensed stations. Some privately owned network affiliates do still exist, although these are now relatively rare and exist only in smaller television markets. =Recent developments= Bell Globemedia (soon after renamed CTVglobemedia and then Bell Media) announced plans to acquire CHUM Limited, in a deal that would place Canada's four largest private English- language broadcast services under just two owners (in CTVgm's case, CTV and Citytv). The enlarged CTVgm would also own interests in nearly 40 specialty channels and pay services. As part of the proposal, CTVgm would sell several of CHUM's less valuable properties, such as the smaller A-Channel system, to Rogers Communications, Canada's largest cable provider and already a major media company in its own right. On June 8, 2007, however, the CRTC approved the CHUM merger, conditional on CTV divesting itself of Citytv rather than A-Channel. This sparked another round of media consolidation. In early 2007, Canwest, in partnership with Goldman Sachs, announced an agreement to buy Alliance Atlantis, another major specialty channel operator, and more deals are expected in the near future. Other major specialty operators include Corus Entertainment (owned by the Shaw family) and Channel Zero. Consolidation has also continued between cable companies, and between specialty channel operators. There are now few of the small family-owned television groups that dominated the formative era of Canadian television, the most notable perhaps being the Stirling family, which owns NTV in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. The twinstick model of broadcasting, in which a single locally owned company operated both CTV and CBC affiliates in a community, is also now rare – within English Canada, only the cities of Thunder Bay and Lloydminster still receive television service from a twinstick operation, and of those two, only Thunder Bay's Thunder Bay Television is still locally owned. In 2012, Bell Media attempted to acquire Astral Media in a takeover. This initial attempt was rejected by the CRTC as this would have resulted in Bell increasing its share of the Canadian broadcasting market to 42%. Bell filed a new application for the proposed takeover with the CRTC on March 6, 2013, two days after the Competition Bureau approved the acquisition;Astral and Bell Comment on New Acquisition Application to CRTC , Broadcaster Magazine, March 6, 2013. the Commission approved the merger on June 27, 2013,CRTC approves Bell-Astral merger, CBC News, June 27, 2013. Retrieved July 16, 2013. with Bell volunteering to sell certain cable television properties including Family Channel, Disney XD, MusiMax, MusiquePlus and Historia as well as Astral's interest in Teletoon, in an attempt to relieve concerns surrounding Bell's total market share in English-language television following the merger (most of the properties were sold to Corus Entertainment – which already owned Teletoon and its related children's specialty channels – although Remstar acquired MusiMax and MusiquePlus and DHX Media acquired Family Channel and its sister channels). Television programming As outlined below, Canadian regulations ensure that the majority of programming aired by Canadian stations are of domestic origin. However, thanks to domestic newscasts and daytime programming, a very large percentage of the airtime in peak viewing hours (in most areas, 7:00 to 11:00 p.m.) can be devoted to programs of foreign origin, in large part due to the significant amount of programming available from the U.S., not to mention the availability of the major U.S. broadcast networks themselves via cable or satellite, or even as terrestrial signals in border markets. A Canadian network is allowed to override the cable or satellite feed of an American broadcast signal when they air the same program simultaneously, ensuring that the Canadian broadcaster, not the American broadcaster, is able to benefit from the advertising revenue associated with broadcasting to the Canadian audience. Arguably this right has led to an even greater glut of American programming on Canadian stations, including programs of little relevance to Canadian audiences, or poorly received series that may never be seen outside North America. In addition, higher rated American shows cannot be seen if the Canadian network overriding the signal interrupts the program for a news bulletin, unless the cable company switches the signal back to the American station's feed. =Scheduling= Many Canadian broadcasters broadcast on a 24-hour schedule. Daily programming begins at about 6:00 a.m., usually with a local or national morning show. Daytime programming, including talk shows and soap operas, follows, although some Canadian stations may air \\"brokered-time\\" religious or charitable programming as well, which unlike traditional infomercials can count towards Canadian content requirements. Most Canadian television stations are required to carry some news programming as per their license. As opposed to the U.S. model, most stations, even in major markets like Toronto, carry a single newscast during the late-afternoon/early- evening period, specifically from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m. However, as in the U.S., \\"strip\\" programming fills the following hour, at least in the Eastern and Pacific time zones, and is followed by prime time programming. One or more newscasts follow, usually beginning at 11:00 p.m.; the main exception is The National, which airs at 10:00 p.m. on CBC. However, there is a growing trend of some television stations adopting a newscast schedule similar to the American television model, with locally produced newscasts in the mornings (usually lasting about 3 to 3½ hours and airing only on weekdays, though a few stations do carry weekend morning newscasts) and during the lunch hour, in addition to early and late-evening newscasts; most owned-and-operated stations of Global nationwide and most CTV O&Os; located west of the Ontario/Manitoba border have adopted this scheduling format for their local news programming. In contrast, some stations carry a locally produced morning news programs even if they do not carry evening newscasts at all (such as City's owned-and- operated stations, all of which produce a weekday morning news/talk program using the title Breakfast Television; the television system's Toronto flagship CITY-DT is the only Citytv O&O;, as well as one of only three stations affiliated with the network, to carry nightly locally produced evening newscasts). To maximize simultaneous substitution opportunities, in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones, prime time programming airs from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m., while in the Central Time Zone it generally airs from 7:00 to 10:00 p.m., in both cases mirroring the U.S. networks. However, viewers in the Mountain Time Zone – i.e. Alberta – have historically received U.S. network feeds from the Pacific Time Zone, not from the Mountain Time Zone. Similarly, those in Atlantic Canada receive U.S. feeds from the Eastern Time Zone. Local stations in those regions also use 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. (8:30 to 11:30 p.m. in Newfoundland and Southeast Labrador) as prime time, but with most programming advanced by an hour (thus programming seen from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones is typically seen from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m. in the Atlantic and Mountain Time Zones (9:30 to 11:30 p.m. Newfoundland Time)), and 10:00 p.m. programming aired earlier in the evening at 8:00 p.m. (8:30 p.m. Newfoundland Time). Also, in the rare event a program scheduled to start before 10:00 p.m. in the Eastern and/or Pacific Time Zones runs into the 10:00 p.m. hour, Atlantic and Mountain Time Zone stations will typically delay their 11:00 p.m. news programming to 12:00 a.m. and air the entire program in unison with the time zone directly west (thus, a program scheduled to air from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m. in Eastern and Pacific Time Zones is typically aired from 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. in the Atlantic and Mountain Time Zones (10:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Newfoundland Time), with syndicated programming airing in the 8:00 p.m. hour). CBC Television airs all programming corresponding to the local time zone, except for a 30-minute delay in the Newfoundland Time Zone. Overnight programming varies from broadcaster to broadcaster, and may consist of purchased programming or infomercials, or repeat airings of daytime programming. =Canadian content= While under Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission regulations at least 60% of program has to be Canadian-produced, and 50% during prime time, English-language private broadcasters such as CTV and Global have always had difficulty airing more than a bare minimum of Canadian-produced programming in primetime; in actual practice, network and local news accounts for a large proportion of the Canadian content on most stations, with each of the commercial networks rarely having more than one or two Canadian-produced drama or comedy series on their schedules at any given time. Among the English language broadcasters, only the public CBC Television airs a schedule that consists almost entirely of Canadian-produced programming, although even it will sometimes air selected programming from Britain, Australia or PBS (American Public Television) in the United States. Scripted television programming in Canada tends toward the shorter runs more typical of British television rather than the longer seasons that predominate in the United States. A typical Canadian drama or comedy series will produce between six and thirteen episodes in its first season, although an exceptionally popular series such as Corner Gas may produce up to 20 episodes in later seasons. A slight deviation from this model is with the long-running teen drama Degrassi (an incarnation of the popular Degrassi High series franchise), which due to a switch to a more serialized format in 2011, began producing up to 40 episodes per season. Less expensive forms of programming, such as news and sketch comedy programs, will usually produce many more episodes each year, coming closer to the American model. The French- language commercial networks air significantly more Canadian content than their English counterparts. Languages While the majority of services operate in English, there are a growing number of similar services in the French language, serving primarily Quebec. Ici Radio-Canada Télé, the French- language equivalent of CBC Television, broadcasts terrestrially across Canada, while TVA, one of Quebec's two commercial French-language networks, is available across Canada on satellite and cable. RDI, the French equivalent of CBC News Network, also has cross-Canada cable carriage rights, as does TV5 Québec Canada. Most other French-language networks are available only in Quebec, although some have optional cable carriage status in the rest of Canada. V, for instance, is carried on cable in New Brunswick and parts of Ontario and is available nationally by satellite. The Ontario government's French public television network TFO is the only French-language broadcaster in Canada whose operations are located entirely outside of Quebec. Other ethnic and multicultural services, serving one or more cultural groups outside of these two official languages, are also growing in strength. Six terrestrial TV stations, CFMT and CJMT in Toronto, CFHG in Montreal, CJEO in Edmonton, CJCO in Calgary and CHNM in Vancouver, air multicultural programming in a variety of languages, while Telelatino airs programming in Italian and Spanish on basic cable. Numerous third-language channels have been licensed as Category 2 services on digital cable. The Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) airs programming targeted to the Indigenous peoples of Canada; 28 per cent of the network's content is broadcast in aboriginal languages. The business and regulation of television The Canadian broadcasting industry, including all programming services (over-the-air or otherwise) and all distributors, is regulated in regards to ownership and content by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which in most cases issues licences for each such operation. The CRTC issues licences pursuant to Canadian laws and the Commission's own regulations and conditions of licence, which regulate such matters as Canadian content, domestic ownership and accessibility issues such as closed captioning. Among other regulations, all Canadian broadcasters and distributors must be at least 80% owned and controlled by Canadian citizens; also, all conventional stations, and most established specialty services, are required to air a majority of Canadian content, both throughout its schedule and in its primetime schedule. Industry Canada regulates the technical aspects of broadcast stations and certain aspects of other licensed undertakings. =Broadcast television= Unlike specialty services, conventional (or over-the-air) broadcast stations are permitted to air a wide variety of news, information, entertainment, sports and other programming without any restriction as to theme or content, and none restrict themselves in that regard. Religious television stations are an exception to the previous statement but must provide a variety of programs reflecting different points of view. CRTC regulations have so far prevented a large number of the infomercial- or religious-based stations now frequently found in major centres in the U.S. from operating in Canada; infomercials, even those made in Canada, are not considered Canadian content. Nearly all broadcast stations have now been aligned, in one form or another, into national groups based on ownership and/or content. Many of these groups are designated as \\"networks\\", in the colloquial sense, below, although in the regulatory sense they may or may not be licensed networks. However, they are often treated very differently from U.S. networks. For instance, most networks provide a full slate of programming, often, but not always, buying the national rights to \\"syndicated\\" programs that air across affiliates of multiple American networks. In Canada, hence Dr. Phil and The Ellen DeGeneres Show only air on CTV stations, and Entertainment Tonight only on Global stations. However, for historical reasons, The Oprah Winfrey Show (until it ended its run in 2011) aired on a mixture of stations, albeit one dominated by CTV. Also, it is not uncommon to find multiple affiliates of one network, and no affiliates of another network, available in the same market on basic cable, particularly in smaller markets. For instance, in Kingston, Ontario, two CBC affiliates are available, a local privately owned station and a CBC-owned station from Ottawa, while CTV Two is not available in that market. In many markets, including some major cities, there is only a handful of local stations, with other network services provided by an affiliate based hundreds of kilometres away. For instance, in Ottawa, only three English networks/systems – CBC, CTV and CTV Two – have stations based in the market; the \\"local\\" Global and Citytv stations are in fact rebroadcasters of Toronto- area stations. Such a scenario would be virtually unheard of in a major American market. Despite a general CRTC policy that limits station ownership to one station per market per language per company, several exceptions have led to twinstick operations in several markets. In some cases, this allows multiple stations to serve a small market that could otherwise support only one station. In larger markets, however, Canwest and CHUM had justified several instances of twinsticks, generally two stations based in separate but neighbouring regions. This was allowed on the basis that, in another owner's hands, stations like CHCH in Hamilton, Ontario and CHEK in Victoria, British Columbia (both Canwest stations that were sold off in 2009, CHCH to Channel Zero and CHEK to a consortium of the station's employees) would inevitably turn their focus to the larger Toronto and Vancouver markets respectively, leaving their cities of licence with little or no local news coverage. This led to the development of the respective E! and A (now CTV Two) systems. Nonetheless, the local news coverage these stations provide do not prevent them from airing programs with mass appeal during the rest of their schedules, frequently promoted on their sister stations. All stations have call signs beginning in \\"CB\\", \\"CF\\", \\"CH\\", \\"CI\\", \\"CJ\\" or \\"CK\\", but few now use them. While Industry Canada nominally maintains a requirement for stations to identify themselves every hour on the hour,Broadcasting Procedures and Rules - Part 1 , Industry Canada, September 2006, section 7.3 in practice this is rarely enforced. Meanwhile, the major networks have striven to minimize the costs associated with multiple brand names. Some newer call signs are rarely known outside the industry (such as CKXT or \\"Sun TV\\"), while the major networks have largely removed all traces of formerly well-known call signs on local stations or their websites. A notable if partial exception is CITY-DT in Toronto, which, along with several sister stations, use the \\"Citytv\\" (originally City) brand name. Networks, systems and groups The publicly funded CBC operates two broadcast networks, CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada Télé, respectively operating in English and French. Both are devoted primarily to domestic content, albeit with different programming: the French-language service, which does not have significant foreign competition, has been considered a major success in recent years, while many have found much to be desired on its English counterpart over the same time. The English network in particular has suffered immensely due to various cuts to, and restructurings of, the CBC's budget, beginning in the late 1980s, as well as greater competition with private broadcasters, both domestic and foreign, in English Canada. Both networks are available over-the-air in most of the country. The first tier of national private networks include CTV, Global, Citytv and TVA. CTV, Citytv and Global are English networks, which generally split the most popular foreign programs between them, with significant local news programming in most areas but limited amounts of domestic content in primetime. Both CTV and Global are available over-the-air in most regions; Citytv is available in virtually all of Canada's major media markets, but has only partial coverage in other areas. Much like CTV and Global, Citytv originally focused on movies and niche-appeal programs in primetime, although it has gradually added more series of broader appeal, despite lacking a presence in Atlantic Canada. TVA, a French-language network available throughout Quebec over-the-air and elsewhere via cable and satellite, airs mostly programming made in Quebec, to great success in that province; see also Quebec television. CTV, Global, Citytv and TVA are respectively owned by Bell Canada through its Bell Media division, Corus Entertainment, Rogers Communications through its Rogers Media division and Quebecor Media. The remaining networks or systems have a more limited reach or audience appeal. As the CRTC is much more conservative in licensing individual stations than the FCC, they do not reach all markets; in fact CTV Two consists almost entirely of former CBC affiliates that disaffiliated from CBC Television and quickly turned their focus towards larger nearby markets. These networks include: * CTV Two, a secondary service owned by CTV. * Noovo, a French-language network owned by Bell Media; availability in Quebec is roughly equal to that of TVA but availability outside of Quebec is limited. * APTN, a non-profit Aboriginal service carried primarily via cable. * Omni Television, a system of five multicultural stations owned by Rogers Communications. These stations also air syndicated programming. * Joytv, a system of two religious stations owned by S-VOX, which were sold by Rogers and were formerly part of the Omni Television system. * CTS, a system of three religious-based stations owned by Crossroads Christian Communications. Many smaller markets have stations that receive programming from more than one network. Most notably, CJON-DT (or \\"NTV\\") in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador airs CTV's newscasts along with its own locally produced NTV Evening Newshour, but relies mainly on Global for entertainment programs. Some markets have at least one provincial educational service available, namely TVOntario and TFO (Ontario), Télé-Québec and Canal SAVOIR (Quebec), Citytv Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan), Knowledge (British Columbia), and CTV Two Alberta (Alberta). Of these, all except CTV Two Alberta and Citytv Saskatchewan are owned by governmental or nonprofit agencies; CTV Two Alberta is owned by Bell Media and Citytv Saskatchewan by Rogers Communications, and both serve as educational broadcasters during the day while offering the programming of one of Canada's commercial television networks or systems in prime time. Other major stations include CFHG-DT, a multicultural independent station in Montreal airing programs in various foreign languages; CJIL-TV (or \\"The Miracle Channel,\\" in southern Alberta); and locally owned independent station CHEK-DT in Victoria, British Columbia. A number of American stations, such as independent station KVOS-TV in Bellingham, Washington, and the Fox affiliates in Buffalo, New York (WUTV) and Burlington, Vermont (WFFF), have also aggressively courted Canadian advertisers and are perceived by many viewers and advertisers as effectively Canadian stations. =Multichannel television= Cable and satellite television services are available throughout Canada, delivering local and often regional stations, the major U.S. networks, and additional programming via specialty and other non-broadcast channels. The largest cable providers are Rogers Cable, Shaw Cable, Vidéotron, Telus and Cogeco, while the two licensed satellite providers are Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct. Specialty channels, unlike cable networks in the U.S., must be licensed by the CRTC. They must be focused on a specific genre and cannot include general-interest services of akin to American services TNT or USA Network; as a result programs from these U.S. channels often end up on conventional stations, not cable. Specialty channels include such categories as sports (such as TSN), news (such as CBC News Network and CTV News Channel), music (such as MuchMusic), arts (such as CTV Drama Channel), cartoons (such as Treehouse TV and YTV) and drama (such as Showcase). Anglophone premium television services include The Movie Network (which serves areas east of the Ontario–Manitoba border), Movie Central (which serves areas west of that border), Super Channel (which is available nationally), and Super Écran (which serves French-speaking Canadiens). Some U.S. channels are also available, although these are also subject to CRTC approval. Aside from the four main broadcast networks, they are generally prohibited if a similar Canadian channel has already launched at the time of the request for Canadian carriage. American cable networks have occasionally been removed outright if an equivalent Canadian channel is licensed, as in the case of CMT. =Internet television= Internet television in Canada includes streaming services from both local and international companies. Along with international services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ and others, majors local providers includes Crave, CBC Gem, ICI Tou.TV and Club illico. Technology In Canada, over-the-air television signals are primarily broadcast using the NTSC (analogue) and ATSC (digital) formats. The CRTC set August 31, 2011, as the deadline for full-power over-the-air television transmitters broadcasting in 28 mandatory markets to move to digital transmission; as a result, the ATSC digital standard has become the primary means of transmitting over-the-air broadcast signals in Canada. Canada has not announced any further over-the-air digital conversion deadlines. Permits for new analogue television transmitters are no longer being granted. In April 2017, it was announced by Industry Canada that all remaining analogue over-the-air television signals across Canada are scheduled to be shut down no later than 2022.Digital Television (DTV) Transition Schedule - Updated April 2017 - Industry Canada See also *List of television stations in Canada by call sign *List of Canadian television channels *Canadian science fiction television *Canadian television awards *Lists of Canadian television series * List of defunct Canadian television stations *Sports broadcasting contracts in Canada ReferencesFurther reading  *Druick, Zoë.

History  Selkups speak the Selkup language, which belongs to the Samoyedic languages of the Uralic language family. The Selkups originated in the middle basin of the Ob River, from interactions between the aboriginal Yeniseian population and Samoyedic peoples that came to the region from the Sayan Mountains during the early part of the first millennium CE. In the 13th century, the Selkups came under the sway of the Mongols. Around 1628, the Russians conquered the area and the Selkups were subjugated. The Selkups joined a uprising against Russian rule but were gunned downed and defeated. In the 17th century, some of the Selkups relocated up north to live along the Taz River and Turukhan River. They were engaged mainly in hunting, fishing, and reindeer breeding. The arrival of Russian settlers to the area in the 18th century led to the Russians hunting down the reindeers of the Selkups which made breeding reindeer much more difficult. During the same period, the Russians attempted to Russify and Christianize the Selkups. However, many retained some of their ancient religious beliefs and customs. During the Soviet period, the Selkups were forced to adopt a settled lifestyle and their traditional culture witnessed a severe decline. The Selkups have been facing cultural extinction and assimiliation from Russian culture. They also suffer from racial discrimination, unemployment and alcoholism. According to the 2002 Census, there were 4,249 Selkups in Russia (4,300 in 1970). There were 62 Selkups in Ukraine, only one of whom is a native speaker of the Selkup language (Ukrainian Census 2001).

Many of the former Rich's stores today form the core of Macy's Central, an Atlanta-based division of Macy's, Inc., which formerly operated as Federated Department Stores, Inc. HistoryBeginnings= Rich's 1906 building, known as the M. Rich and Brothers and Company Building at 52-54-56 Whitehall, now 82 Peachtree St. SE, as seen in 2013. The retailer began in Atlanta as M. Rich & Co., a dry goods store, on 28 May 1867,http://www.ourgeorgiahistory.com/year/1867 at 36 Whitehall Street, sole proprietor Mauritius Reich (Anglicized to Morris Rich), a Hungarian Jewish immigrant. It was renamed M. Rich & Bro. in 1877, when he and brother Emanuel formed a partnership. In 1884 when the third brother Daniel was admitted into the partnership, the name became M. Rich & Bros. With business success came a need for expansion, and the store was moved to ever larger locations: in July 1875 to 35 Whitehall; in September 1875 to 43 Whitehall; in October 1875, to 65 Whitehall, at the corner of Hunter (now M.L. King Blvd.); and in September, 1882, to 54-56 Whitehall.Rich's: A Southern Institution, Jeff Clemmons, pp. 26, 30-31 By 1877, Rich's was considered one of the \\"Big Five\\" stores in town, in the league of Chamberlain, Boyton, & Co.; Ryan's; Keeley's; and Dougherty's; and later, of the J.M. High Company. In 1901 Rich's became a true department store when they divided like merchandise into separated sections. The company was incorporated as M. Rich & Bros. Co. In 1906, the adjacent M. Kutz & Co. building at 52 Whitehall was acquired. Both it and 54-56 Whitehall were torn down. Rich's closed its furniture annex and moved its dry goods to that building, until a new building could be built on the site of 52-54-56 Whitehall.\\"Rebuilding sale of furniture, advertisement by M.

Rich and Brothers and Company Building\\", City of Atlanta Urban Design Commission In 1924 Rich's moved into its last flagship store at 45 Broad St. SE, between Alabama and Hunter streets, which it would occupy until closing in 1991, \\"Rich's Plans To Close Its Main Store\\", Isadore Barmash, New York Times, April 18, 1991 That building, a part of the Sam Nunn Atlanta Federal Center complex, was added to eight times during its department store life. It is an example of Palazzo style architecture, a favorite theme associated with department stores constructed in the early twentieth century. The 1946/1948 Store for Homes addition, to the west of the 1924 building across Forsyth Street, was one of Atlanta's earliest examples of International Style architecture.Library of Congress In 1929, the company was reorganized and the retail portion of the business became, simply, Rich's, while a new, separate venture named M. Rich & Bros. Co. would operate as a real estate company. Daniel's son Walter Rich succeeded his uncle Morris as Rich's president from 1926 to 1947. The grandson of Morris Rich, Richard H. Rich, took over the store in 1949. Under the leadership of Richard Rich, affectionately known as Dick Rich, Rich's began expansion in the 1950s. Rich's moved outside the Atlanta area for its first new store in 1955 when a store in Knoxville Tennessee was opened. Rich's opened its first suburban store at Lenox Square in 1959, Georgia's first shopping mall. The open-air mall shared space with the other major Atlanta department store, Davison's. That same year Rich's also opened a store at Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center, a large two-level strip mall in Belvedere Park near Decatur and more recently famous for its \\"wigs and beepers\\" store. Rich's sold off its Knoxville store to Miller's when profits fell off, and refocused on its Georgia stores. =Holiday traditions= Two holiday traditions associated with Rich's were the Great Tree and the Pink Pig. Starting in 1948, the Great Tree, conceptualized by executive Frank Pallotta, was a massive pine, set on top of the multi-level glass \\"Crystal Bridge\\" connecting the main downtown Atlanta store which housed the \\"Store for Fashion\\" with the \\"Store For Homes\\" across Forsyth Street. After the closure of the downtown store in 1991, the Great Tree, and the annual Thanksgiving evening tree-lighting festivities, moved to nearby Underground Atlanta. After several years of poor attendance, the Tree was moved to the top of the Men's Store at the Lenox Square location. This placed the tree on the corner of the mall closest to the prominent intersection of Peachtree and Lenox Roads. The tree lighting ceremony traditionally features country and pop music performers from Georgia, such as Kenny Rogers, several choirs from local churches, and a rendition of \\"O Holy Night\\" with the tree being lit by a child during the high note of the line \\"O night divine.\\" The Pink Pig (installed in 1956 and known originally as The Snowball Express) was a child-scaled monorail that hung from the toy department's ceiling in the downtown Store for Fashion. In 1965, it was moved to the roof of the store where a second monorail was added and the duo became known as the Pink Pig Flyers (receiving the names of Priscilla and Percival in the 1970s). The front car of the trains had pig faces and the last cars had curly tails. For many years after the closure of the downtown store, the Pink Pigs were set up at the Festival of Trees at the Georgia World Congress Center. Macy's Lenox Square continues the holiday tradition using a redesigned child-sized train (rather than a monorail) set up on the top level of the Lenox Road Parking Deck. The train ride takes riders through a storybook tale of Priscilla Pig. The original Pink Pig Flyers monorail cars are now at the Atlanta History Center where they are occasionally displayed. =Dear Store= In 1967, Atlanta Constitution columnist Celestine Sibley wrote Dear Store: An Affectionate Portrait of Rich's. In it, she mentioned notable acts by Rich's staff and management, including the cashing of scrip payments made by the City of Atlanta to its schoolteachers during a financial crisis, accepting returns of worn nylons during World War II shortages, and the efforts of their personal shopper service, \\"Penelope Penn,\\" to find the perfect gift for thousands of customers who wrote to them. The title of the book comes from a letter in which a child offers to trade his younger sister for a toy that he wants. The book also relates the story of Coretta Scott King, who chose to shop at Rich's for a coat to wear in Norway at the ceremony for husband Martin Luther King Jr.'s Nobel Peace Prize. The salesperson advised Mrs. King not to buy a fur, because it would compare unfavorably to the extravagant furs worn by the Scandinavian attendees, instead selecting a conservative cloth coat for the occasion. =Expansion= Rich's most aggressive expansion was during the 1960s and 1970s. Four more stores opened in the Atlanta area in the 1960s, two of those enormous three-story full-line stores. While this expansion resulted in continued success of the chain, it chipped away at the business of the downtown store. By this time, Rich's was the leading regional department store in the country, though it remained largely unknown by the general public outside of Georgia. This would soon change, however. Throughout the 1970s, four more Rich's locations opened in Georgia including one in Augusta, the first in the state outside of Atlanta. Rich's also began an aggressive expansion with stores in Alabama and South Carolina. Also, there were plans much later in the early 1990s to expand Rich's into Charlotte, but these were scrapped. Of all the stores out of state, stores opened in Greenville, Columbia and Birmingham (with two, adding a third in 1986) created stiffer competition in those cities against regional chains Pizitz, Loveman's and Parisian. =Federated= The sale to Federated in 1976 ended over 100 years of ownership by the Rich family. Aside from the Great Tree, most of the traditions of Rich's and the departments (including the bakery) were all stripped away by the early 1990s. Loyalty to the chain, however, remained very strong even after the downtown flagship store was closed in 1991. In 1994, the parent company of Rich's bought out Macy's, which was historically Atlanta's rival chain under the Davison's banner. The following year, Rich's was merged with Lazarus in the midwest and Goldsmith's in Memphis. Through the merged division, the chain grew in a corporate sense as it was operated out of Atlanta, but the Lazarus and Goldsmith's stores continued to operate under their regional names. The merger with Goldsmith's occurred in 1988 and Lazarus in 1995. Lazarus was one of Federated's founding store chains. =Closures of Davison's/Macy's stores= When Rich's and Macy's both were owned by the same company, this resulted in the overlapping of the two chains all selling the same products. Initially, both stores remained open with Macy's losing its higher-end merchandise and becoming distinctly downmarket when compared with Rich's. The decision was made in 2003 to close all of the former Davison's/Macy's stores in Atlanta (no new Macy's stores had been built in Atlanta since Town Center at Cobb in 1986) and co-brand Rich's as Rich's-Macy's. The only original Macy's/Davison's store to remain open is Northlake Mall - originally the downtown Atlanta store was to remain open, but a sudden change of direction by Macy's corporate closed the last major retailer in downtown Atlanta. The cobranded name change was intended to slowly phase out the chain instead of a sudden change so as to reduce the backlash over the elimination of an Atlanta institution that was one of the institutions that defined the city, similar to Marshall Field's in Chicago. As Macy's was a well-known part of the Atlanta retail landscape since its purchase of Davison's in the 1920s, loyal Rich's customers who defected to other stores were replaced by longtime Macy's/Davison's customers. The same year that Rich's and Macy's merged, the downtown Macy's (Davison's flagship store) was closed. Also in the merger, the Lenox Square Macy's and Perimeter Mall Macy's (both former Davison's) reopened as Bloomingdale's. The Perimeter Mall location closed in March 2012, reopening as a branch of the Von Maur chain. The Lenox Square location is still open as of 2020. The rest closed except for the Town Center Mall store, the middle floor of which is currently a Macy's Furniture store; the upper floor is a Macy's Furniture Clearance Center; the lower floor is currently Macy's Men's Store. The following year, when the Cobb Center Mall store closed, the furniture clearance center was relocated there. In 1995, the downtown Atlanta Rich's 1924 store became part of the Sam Nunn Atlanta Federal Center. It is known as \\"The 1924 Building\\". The Store For Homes, the \\"Crystal Bridge,\\" and a concrete parking deck with a locally-famous spiral down ramp were razed, and replaced by a high-rise, a small building containing a McDonald's and other retail space, and a more substantial connector between the high-rise and the original 1924 Rich's building. The top floor of the 1924 building, a later addition of concrete and glass block not in the style of the original, was removed. An addition in the style of the original was built on the corner of Forsyth and Old Alabama Streets, which had been a park and previously the location of the offices of The Atlanta Journal before its merger with The Atlanta Constitution. =Name changes= After 138 years, Rich's (later as Rich's-Macy's) brand disappeared on March 6, 2005. Other historical retail nameplates \\"Goldsmith-Macy's\\" and \\"Lazarus-Macy's\\" were eliminated, with the stores rebranded as Macy's. Atlanta-area stores are in the Macy's Southeast Region with Atlanta East & Atlanta West Districts.\\"Maps by Market\\" Macy's, Inc. A signature event of the store, Rich's Great Tree, continues as an annual Thanksgiving event in Atlanta at the Lenox location as Macy's Great Tree. Some buildings which once housed Rich's stores continue to operate under the Macy's banner. Some former Rich's buildings are no longer in use, as the malls which housed them have been shuttered.

Within it are the Adam Lake and Max Lake campgrounds. The park is known for its bike trails, fishing, back country cabins and canoe routes. The park is very popular with families and outdoor enthusiasts. The park is named after the numerous painted turtles found in the area.\\"Turtle Mountain Provincial Park\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia, 23 May 2019, Historica Canada. https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/turtle-mountain-provincial- park. Accessed 24 September 2019. The turtles can be seen throughout the warmer months sun bathing near permanent ponds or lakes in the park. In late spring and early summer the females can be seen laying eggs in sandy soil throughout the park. The turtles live in the shallow lakes in the park.Braman, D., Sweet, A., & Lerbekmo, J. (1999). Upper Cretaceous - lower tertiary lithostratigraphic relationships of three cores from Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, Canada. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 36(5), 669-683. Turtle Mountain Provincial Park was designated a provincial park by the Government of Manitoba in 1961. The park is in size. The park is considered to be a Class II protected area under the IUCN protected area management categories. It is adjacent to the international border between Canada and the United States. Its southeast corner is adjacent to the International Peace Garden which is located in both Manitoba and the U.S. state of North Dakota. To the east is the William Lake Provincial Park, home to the William Lake Campground, and the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration. To the north is the town of Boissevain, with the city of Brandon farther north. Most of the park is situated in the southwesternmost section of the Municipality of Boissevain – Morton, while the rest of it lies in the southeast corner of the Municipality of Deloraine – Winchester. The park is nearly coterminous with the slightly larger Turtle Mountain Provincial Forest. The only difference is a small section of the forest lying east of Manitoba Highway 10 at the southeast corner of the forest (near the International Peace Garden), which is outside the park's territory.  History  Early history = Following the last ice age, Turtle Mountain Provincial Park became the first inhabited location in Manitoba. It is also the biggest remaining natural deciduous forest in southwestern Manitoba. Once coniferous forests grew and animals were attracted to the area, nomadic hunters soon followed. Stone tools have been found, confirming their presence. Based on the exhumed artifacts, archaeologists have concluded these people were hunter gatherers, not farmers. Turtle Mountain can be found on the Palliser map of 1865. In 1875 George Mercer Dawson became the first geologist to travel through Turtle Mountain Provincial Park. Dawson noted the glacial deposits throughout the park. = Indigenous peoples = Métis from the Red River Colony travelled to Turtle Mountain Provincial Park for annual hunting trips between 1810 and 1870. After the buffalo hunt ended many Métis built homesteads within the park. The location was known by the Métis as Tête de Tortue, seeing a resemblance to the buckler of a turtle, its head being represented by the conical mound standing out from one end (CPCGN files). Two notable cultural sites are the Dunseith Trail and Oskar Lake archeological site. The Dunseith Trail was the first trail across Turtle Mountain, and the archeological site was used by Cree hunters over 400 years ago.  Use and activities  Formerly, the park was predominantly used for agricultural purposes due to the presence of hardwoods.Turtle Mountain Provincial Park Management Plan. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/pdf/planning/turtle_mountain_management_plan.pdf The area is no longer dependent on Turtle Mountain for timber, so it is now mainly used for recreation and ranching. There is a trail system used for biking, hiking, and horseback riding. There are also various beaches, playgrounds, and picnic areas for recreational use. The eutrophication of many of the water bodies can make it difficult for recreation in the summer. The most common type of farming is grain farming.Eilers, R.G., et al (1978). Soils of the Boissevain Melita Area, Manitoba Department of Agriculture, Report No. 20. Geography Ecoregions of Manitoba Turtle Mountain Provincial Park is situated on the Turtle Mountain (plateau), one of a number of significant geographic features located along the Manitoba Escarpment, the Canadian portion of the Pembina Escarpment. It is located in the Southwest Manitoba Uplands Ecoregion, within the Canadian Prairies.Smith, R.E., H. Veldhuis, G.F. Mills, R.G. Eilers, W.R. Fraser, and G.W. Lelyk. 1998.

Campanian to Paleocene dinoflagellate assemblages from the Turtle Mountain core hole, Manitoba, western Canada. Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 36(5), 769-774. Once deglaciation finished 14,000 years ago the irregular melting pattern left the area covered in hummocky terrain. The soils are mainly grey and black chernozems. There are grey luvisols at higher elevations. The bedrock in the park is composed of sandstone, shale, lignite coal. There are over 200 lakes and wetlands in this region. Many of the shorelines are covered in thick vegetation due to the littoral zone cattails. This park is home to the largest oak trees in Manitoba, which are the lone survivors of a fire that occurred in the early 20th century. Many of the water bodies are less than 15 feet deep, which often results in a winter decline in fish populations due to lack of oxygen.  Flora and fauna  Turtle Mountain Provincial Park is located within the temperate deciduous forest, and is predominantly covered by Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen). Other vegetation species include balsam poplar and bur oak. Turtle mountain is home to many wildlife species such as moose, white-tailed deer, beaver, raccoons, and various types of birds. The lakes contain various fish species such as rainbow and brown trout.

Their language is classified as a southern dialect within the group of dialects called the Altay language.Altai Republic - Teleuts (Республика Алтай - Телеуты) : web link '  History  The Teleuts were once part of the Tiele people. They came under the rule of the First Turkic Khaganate. The Teleuts emerged from the result of Kipchaks and Mongols mixing together. Near the end of the 16th century, the Teleuts wandered the steppe between the Irtysh and the Ob'. They became nominal subjects to the Oirats at this period. Their population at this time numbered 4,000 tents. The Russians gained control of the region in the mid eighteenth century and the Teleuts subsequently became their subjects. The Russians called the Teleuts \\"White Kalmyks\\" in their documents despite the ethnic and linguistic differences between the Kalmyks and Teleuts. The Teleuts consider themselves to be a distinct people and many don't accept being labeled as Altaian. The majority of the Teleuts live along the Great and Little Bachat Rivers in Kemerovo Oblast. However, a few Teleuts also live in the Altai Republic.  Culture  Most Teleuts used to be nomadic or semi-nomadic livestock herders and horses, goats, cattle, and sheep were the most common types of animals they raised. Some Teleuts were hunters and relied on animals living in the taiga for subsistence. Traditional Teleut dwellings included conic yurts made out of bark or perches. Common Teleut dress was composed of linen shirts, short breeches, and single-breasted robes.  Religion  Most Teleuts are Orthodox Christians. However, there is a significant minority that practice shamanism and Sunni Islam. Burkhanism is practiced by some Altaians as well.

The Orok language belongs to the Southern group of the Tungusic language family. According to the 2002 Russian census, there were 346 Oroks living in Northern Sakhalin by the Okhotsk Sea and Southern Sakhalin in the district by the city of Poronaysk. According to the 2010 census there were 295 Oroks in Russia. Etymology The name Orok is believed to derive from the exonym Oro given by a Tungusic group meaning \\"a domestic reindeer\\". The Orok self-designation endonym is Ul'ta, probably from the root Ula (meaning \\"domestic reindeer\\" in Orok). Another self-designation is Nani. Occasionally, the Oroks, as well as the Orochs and Udege, are erroneously called Orochons. Population and settlement The total number of Oroks in Russia, according to the 2002 Russian Census, is 346 people. They live mostly in Sakhalin Oblast. Most of the Oroks are concentrated in three settlements – Poronaysk, Nogliki and the village of Val, Nogliksky District. A total of 144 Oroks live in Val. Other places in which the Orok people live include: the villages of Gastello and Vakhrushev in Poronaysky District; the village of Viakhtu in Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky District; the village of Smirnykh, Smirnykhovsky District; Okhinsky District; and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the administrative center of Sakhalin Oblast. Furthermore, Orok people live on the island of Hokkaido, Japan – in 1989, there was a community of about 20 people near the city of Abashiri. Their number is currently unknown. History Orok oral tradition indicates that the Oroks share history with the Ulch people, and that they migrated to Sakhalin from the area of the Amgun River in mainland Russia. Research indicates that this migration probably took place in the 17th century at the latest. The Russian Empire gained complete control over Orok lands after the 1858 Treaty of Aigun and 1860 Convention of Peking. A penal colony was established on Sakhalin between 1857 and 1906, bringing large numbers of Russian criminals and political exiles, including Lev Sternberg, an important early ethnographer on Oroks and the island's other indigenous people, the Nivkhs and Ainu. Before Soviet collectivization in the 1920s, the Orok were divided into five groups, each with their own migratory zone. However, following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1922, the new government of the Soviet Union altered prior imperial policies towards the Oroks to bring them into line with communist ideology. In 1932, the northern Oroks joined the collective farm of Val, which was specialised in reindeer breeding, together with smaller numbers of Nivkhs, Evenks and Russians. Following the Russo- Japanese War, southern Sakhalin came under the control of the Empire of Japan, which administered it as Karafuto Prefecture. The Uilta, or Oroks, were classified as \\"Karafuto natives\\" (樺太土人), and were not entered into Japanese- style family registers, in contrast to the Ainu, who had \\"mainland Japan\\" family registers. Like the Karafuto Koreans and the Nivkh, but unlike the Ainu, the Uilta were thus not included in the evacuation of Japanese nationals after the Soviet invasion in 1945. Some Nivkhs and Uilta who served in the Imperial Japanese Army were held in Soviet work camps; after court cases in the late 1950s and 1960s, they were recognised as Japanese nationals and thus permitted to migrate to Japan. Most settled around Abashiri, Hokkaidō. The Uilta Kyokai of Japan was founded to fight for Uilta rights and the preservation of Uilta traditions in 1975 by Dahinien Gendanu. Language and culture Red fox fur mittens of the Orok people, 19th century The Orok language belongs to the Southern group of the Tungusic language family. At present, 64 people of the Sakhalin Oroks speak the Orok language, and all Oroks also speak Russian. An alphabetic script, based on Cyrillic, was introduced in 2007. A primer has been published, and the language is taught in one school on Sakhalin. The Oroks share cultural and linguistic links with other Tungusic peoples, but before the arrival of Russians, they differed economically from similar peoples due to their herding of reindeer. Reindeer provided the Oroks, particularly in northern Sakhalin, with food, clothing, and transportation. The Oroks also practiced fishing and hunting. The arrival of Russians has had a major effect on Orok culture, and most Oroks today live sedentary lifestyles. Some northern Oroks still practice semi-nomadic herding alongside vegetable farming and cattle ranching; in the south, the leading occupations are fishing and industrial labor. Rites of Passage The Orok boys, when it came of time, would usually participate in a Sturgeon Hunt, usually hunting for the Beluga or Kaluga Sturgeon variants. This involved a lone Orok going out, with only a small supply of food (usually enough to last him a week) and armed with a special type of spear. Once the sturgeon was killed, the hunter would take one of the predator's teeth and carve a mark in his forehead or arm, which indicated that the hunt was successful. Due to the fish's size, strength and fierceness, failure to successfully kill the Sturgeon usually resulted in the hunter's death. NotesReferences  * * Further reading *Missonova, Lyudmila I. (2009).

The game was released in Japan in 2005, and in North America and Europe the following year. Originally conceived as a point-and-click adventure game, it was put on developmental hold until Nintendo producer Shigeru Miyamoto gained interest in the title and overhauled its production. The player takes on the role of the eponymous Chibi-Robo, a 10-centimeter-tall robot owned by the Sanderson family. Gameplay revolves around navigating a household and collecting \\"Happy Points\\" by completing various tasks from housework to helping solve the dilemmas of the Sanderson family and the numerous living toys that inhabit their household. Every action consumes energy, requiring the player to recharge using electrical outlets. Chibi-Robo! was generally well received, with praise for the premise, the charming storyline, and sound design. However, some gameplay mechanics and the quality of the graphics drew some criticism. Sales of Chibi-Robo! were modest. It spawned several sequels. For the Nintendo DS, Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol was released in 2007 and Okaeri! Chibi-Robo! Happy Richie Ōsōji! was released in 2009, the latter being a Japan-exclusive. For the Nintendo 3DS, Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder was released in Japan in 2013 and in North America in 2014, and Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash was released in 2015. The original Chibi-Robo! saw a Japanese re-release in 2009 for the Wii as part of the New Play Control! series. Plot Chibi-Robo! takes place in a 1960s-style American home and revolves around a tiny, highly advanced robot of the same name given as a birthday gift to the socially withdrawn eight-year-old Jenny Sanderson by her father. This is much to the dismay of Jenny's mother, a homemaker who is constantly stressed over how much money her husband spends on toys despite his unemployment. Chibi-Robo is packaged with a small \\"Chibi-House\\" and an assistant named Telly Vision who speaks on his behalf. Each of the one million Chibi-Robos in the world is supposed to collect \\"Happy Points\\" by doing good deeds for their owners and must occasionally charge their batteries at electrical outlets. During the night, or when humans are not around in the Sandersons' house, several toys come to life, including the superhero action figure Drake Redcrest, a group of egg-shaped army men called the Free Rangers, a wooden pirate named Plankbeard, and others. Chibi-Robo eventually finds a large robot in the basement called Giga-Robo, who was once a companion of the Sandersons', but had to be deactivated due to its high electricity consumption. Chibi-Robo attempts to revive Giga-Robo by fully charging its massive battery and makes it a goal to find Giga-Robo's missing leg, but is attacked by spider-like robots called Spydorz. When Mr. Sanderson purchases yet another toy, his wife locks herself in her room and tells him that she wants a divorce, prompting the rest of the family to do housework in an attempt to make up for it. Meanwhile, Chibi-Robo finds a strange pattern in the backyard and uses his radar to contact an alien species. Once the aliens land and greet him, Chibi-Robo uses a time machine made by the visitors to go into the past to find a code to enter a safe in the master bedroom containing Giga Robo's leg. He returns to the present to open the safe, but several larger Spydorz are released and capture the Sandersons. It is revealed that Mr. Sanderson originally created the Spydorz to be friends with the Chibi- Robos, but his toy company reprogrammed them to be hostile, causing Mr. Sanderson to quit his job. Mr. Sanderson upgrades Chibi-Robo's blaster weapon, allowing the small robot to defeat the Queen Spydor, recover Giga-Robo's missing leg, and rescue the Sandersons. Chibi-Robo reactivates Giga-Robo, and the aliens meet them in the backyard. The aliens explain that the toys are able to walk and talk due to a request from Giga-Robo to give them life and to give all Giga-Robos infinite battery power to prevent their energy consumption. The aliens could not do the latter at the time and returned to their own planet to obtain the item necessary to grant Giga-Robo's wish. They then give Giga-Robo this ability, who shares it with Chibi-Robo and the rest of the robots in the world as well, eliminating the energy problem. Gameplay HUD shows the player's remaining time (upper left) and battery life (lower right). Chibi-Robo! is a platform-adventure game that puts the player in direct control of a tiny, battery-powered robot that does housework for humans. The objective of the game is to become the top-ranked \\"Super Chibi-Robo\\" in the world by accumulating Happy Points, a collectible gained by doing good deeds for the family and for various toys in the Sandersons' home. In order to do this, the player must control Chibi-Robo and explore the Sandersons' home. During exploration, Chibi-Robo can find a wide variety of things to collect, including \\"Moolah\\", the currency of Chibi-Robo!. An important task in gaining Happy Points is to clean up messes around the house, such as disposing of trash or scrubbing dirty footprints. The player can also interact with and help with the personal problems of the Sandersons and the toys. This ranges from solving a plot-driving crisis or completing a subquest of simply locating a lost object as a favor. With Chibi-Robo's assistant Telly Vision as his speaker, the player is often prompted to give either a positive or negative response to each question or request. The player loses battery power with every step and action. If his battery is not charged before it empties, Chibi-Robo will collapse and re-emerge in the Chibi-House, having lost half of his Moolah. Throughout the house are electrical outlets, which the player can plug into to recharge his battery or save his progress. The player's exploration is limited by a timer representing a full day or full night. Once the timer expires, Chibi-Robo automatically returns to the Chibi- House. There are three collectibles in the game. One is the stickers, which can be obtained throughout the game, either by completing the game, completing quests, playing mini-games, or doing simple tasks for other non-player characters. The Second is the Frog Rings which can be collected and given to Jenny, the daughter of the Sanderson household, for Happy Points and a sticker. The third is the crayons found throughout the house which can be deposited in a crayon box for Happy Points. At the start of both day and night, the player begins in the Chibi-House, where they can charge Chibi- Robo's battery, save at the electrical outlet, or connect to the Citrusoft \\"Chibi-PC\\" to purchase a variety of items and power-ups with Moolah and use scrap metal to build \\"Utilibots\\", robotic helpers that ease the navigation of the Sandersons' home. The gear available from Citrusoft includes the \\"Chibi- Copter\\", used to reach far-off points or fly down from a high place safely; the \\"Chibi-Blaster\\", used to eliminate obstacles and fend off the hostile Spydorz; and the \\"Chibi-Radar\\", used to detect hidden objects. There are several other items of the Sandersons' that Chibi-Robo can find and use. These include the toothbrush, used to clean up stains; the coffee mug, used for protection; the spoon, used to dig holes; and the squirter, used to hold fluids and squirt them. Chibi-Robo can also gain special costumes throughout the game, each of which has its own function. For instance, if the player poses for Mr. Sanderson while wearing The Drake Redcrest costume, he will give Chibi-Robo Happy Points. As more Happy Points are acquired, the player's rank increases among all the Chibi-Robos in the world. At certain ranks, Citrusoft will send the player bonus batteries, allowing Chibi-Robo to roam longer without having to recharge. Development Chibi-Robo! was developed by Skip Ltd.. Chibi-Robo! was announced in early 2003 with publishing rights held by Bandai. Its original projected release date was June 2003 in Japan and spring 2004 in North America. Unlike the released version of Chibi-Robo!, the beta version entailed the player training Chibi-Robo to defend the home of his inventor from a pair of burglars. The gameplay was different as well; instead of a platform-adventure game, it played like a point-and-click adventure title, where the player was not in direct control of Chibi-Robo, but was rather conveying commands to him by clicking a cursor around the area. The protagonist was also to learn and develop depending on the choices the player made for him. However, this incarnation of Chibi-Robo! was ultimately put on \\"indefinite hold\\" and disappeared from the media. Shigeru Miyamoto was eventually introduced to the game by fellow Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe. Miyamoto took a personal interest in the character of Chibi-Robo and signed on as the game's senior producer. The development of Chibi-Robo! was revamped with Nintendo acting as its new publisher. Chibi-Robo! was in development for four years from start to finish. Director Kenichi Nishi had previous development credits such as Chrono Trigger, Moon: Remix RPG Adventure and Incredible Crisis. Nishi's approach to game design, even with Chibi-Robo!, was to always take a standard, orthodox method and \\"crash it, twist it, or create a totally different direction\\". The reason Nishi chose to make the majority of the cast toys is because humans are \\"too big to interact with [Chibi-Robo] and create all the drama\\" and that it added a sense of fantasy to the experience. The family dog Tao had appeared in Nishi's previous games: Moon: Remix RPG Adventure and L.O.L.: Lack of Love. The director based the dog on his own pet because he felt that the \\"black-and-white color is very simple and universal\\". Despite the game's overall happy attitude, the game designers put some emphasis on serious topics such as divorce, loneliness, pollution, and loss. \\"If we only concentrate on cheerful fun, we'll lose depth,\\" Nishi explained. \\"There's nothing surprising for people if the game looks cheerful and the experience is cheerful. There are no surprises or unexpected things.\\" Still, rather than use these topics as major themes for the player, Nishi felt it would be more effective to bring them in as \\"ordinary things to enhance the adventure of daily life\\". The music and sound in Chibi-Robo! were composed by Hirofumi Taniguchi. He wanted to make unique sound patterns and motifs for each character, and even used human voices to create the system sounds, such as on the menu selections. All of the noises made by Chibi-Robo's actions were phrased. Taniguchi used both woodwind and electronic instruments for the character's actions, the former because \\"Chibi's actions are not ordinary robotlike actions\\" and the latter because he did not want to totally eliminate his mechanical characteristics. Different background music is played for the day and night cycles, but they lack melody because Chibi-Robo's footsteps create a melody at random. The tempo of his footsteps was designed to match the background music; if he picks up his plug to walk faster, the music speeds up. All of the game's music was compiled on the Chibi-Robo! Limited Soundtrack, a CD released alongside an official 142-page guidebook and published by Shogakukan in Japan in August 2005. Reception Chibi-Robo! has enjoyed a generally favorable critical reception. Official Nintendo Magazine ranked it the 88th best game available on Nintendo platforms. The staff felt that it was the GameCube's \\"last classic.\\" Critics Greg Mueller of GameSpot, Mathew Kumar of Eurogamer, Bryn Williams of GameSpy, Shane Satterfield of G4, and Matt Casamassina of IGN all applauded the game's charming setting, compelling storyline, and complex characters. Casamassina found that the fashion in which the main plot and objectives are sewn together is part of the reason the game is enjoyable. Mueller, Kumar, and Satterfield noted endearing, charismatic qualities among the various toy characters. Kumar heeded Chibi- Robo! as \\"honestly one of the most touching games I've played in ages\\" in which the player often becomes engrossed in \\"events that pan out like miniature plays, with love triangles (nay, love dodecahedrons) between toys, and some scenes with a real pathos behind them\\". Considering the joyous atmosphere of Chibi-Robo!, Satterfield was pleasantly surprised at its inclusion of controversial topics like divorce and its possible distortion of a target audience. This attribute was criticized by Jinny Gudmundsen, a columnist for USA Today, who thought that the interpersonal issues negate the game's overall charm and render it inappropriate for younger children. Writers for Computer Games Magazine praised Chibi-Robo by interpreting deep, symbolic meaning in its more subtle aspects. The publication found the game to use \\"overarching narrative arcs\\" and \\"stock melodramatic devices\\" among the Sandersons' dysfunctional interactions, \\"emotional crisis points, downtime, and rhythms and cycles of action\\" between its day and night events, and \\"evocative music\\" as a way for characters to communicate their feelings. Opinions on the gameplay of Chibi-Robo! have been mixed. Among the more positive reactions, Casamassina assessed the cleaning mechanics as \\"very fun and very rewarding\\", while Kumar compared the game to the Story of Seasons series due to both entities convert seemingly boring tasks into something fun. James Mielke of 1UP.com similarly enjoyed the \\"near-constant sense of discovery\\" and the tiny details included by Skip with earning Happy Points and Moolah. Casamassina, Mielke, and Williamson were satisfied that they had to frequently recharge Chibi-Robo, but Mueller was dismayed to have to stop one's current task in order to find an outlet. The GameSpot contributor was also aggravated with the mere five-minute intervals for the day and night cycles, which he considered a major interruption of the game's pacing. Contrarily, Kumar felt the pacing was appropriate and Williamson viewed the feature as a \\"flexible difficulty level setting\\". Satterfield proclaimed that although the gameplay is somewhat varied, most of it is constituted by the tedious location and collection of objects for the non-player characters. Jeremy Zoss of Game Informer was displeased with the game as whole and wrote that it was \\"not a platformer, but more of a 3D adventure game composed entirely of fetch-quests and repetitive menial labor\\". The audio design of Chibi-Robo!, particularly its integration of different instrumental tones for the hero's various actions, was lauded by the press. Kumar felt that its utilization of sound could be \\"the seed of a new way of using music in games\\". Casamassina commented, \\"Few developers would be brave enough to create a title whose main character generates varying musical notes whenever he takes a step, but this is exactly what Chibi does - and it's actually very whimsical and cute.\\" Although many critics appreciated the bright and colorful features of the accompanying aesthetics, they also judged the graphical presentation as dated. Casamassina encountered low-polygon 3D models and a below-average frame rate; Satterfield stated the game operated at \\"Dreamcast level\\". Other portions of Chibi-Robo! were assessed as unpolished as well. Several sources noted the game's default camera system to be unwieldy, combersome, or frustrating at times. However, Mueller noted that switching to the top-down or first-person viewpoints and the ability to center the camera behind Chibi-Robo alleviates most of its problems. Satterfield and Casamassina regarded the cutscenes as awkward and repetitive; the former of the two claimed that they \\"amount to ugly characters recycling the same animation routine over and over while gibberish comes from their gaping maws\\". Kumar perceived the game's combat to be \\"messy\\", \\"uninteresting\\", and \\"entirely unnecessary\\". Chibi-Robo! was not a significant commercial success. According to Media Create, the GameCube version was the fourth best-selling game in Japan for its week ending June 26, 2005 with nearly 29,000 copies sold. The game managed to sell 97,879 units in Japan alone by the end of 2005. The Wii port of the game did not fare as well; it only sold 11,000 copies in Japan for the week ending June 14, 2009 and a total of 38,573 copies throughout the remainder of that year. Sequels Chibi-Robo! received a sequel in 2007 for the Nintendo DS called Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol, which follows a different Chibi-Robo as it attempts to revitalize a park. Nintendo established a deal with Wal-Mart for the exclusive rights to sell it in the United States. A second sequel for the DS, titled Okaeri! Chibi-Robo! Happy Richie Ōsōji!, saw a Japanese release in 2009. It involves yet another Chibi-Robo vacuuming dirt for money within the home of an adult Jenny. The original Chibi-Robo! was re-released as part of New Play Control!, a selection of Wii remakes of GameCube games. The remake features special Wii Remote controls for the game's tools. Aiming the remote allows the player to change perspective, while pointing it at interactive objects with will be identified with a sound. The remake was released in Japan on June 11, 2009, but Nintendo of America did not permit an English release. A fourth game in the series, Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder, was released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS. The fifth game in the series, titled Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash was announced on May 31, 2015 and released in October 2015 for the Nintendo 3DS.

Telengits mainly live in a territory of Kosh-Agach District of the Altai Republic. They are part of a larger cultural group of Southern Altaians. These other groups include: Altai, Telengut, and Tolos.Halemba, Agnieszka E. “The Altai, the Altaians, and the Telengits.” The Telengits of Southern Siberia: landscape, religion and knowledge in motion. New York: Routledge, 2006. pg. 17  History  Chinese chroniclers might have mentioned Telengits as 多覽葛 (Mand. duōlǎngé < MC: *tâ-lâm-kât).Gumilyov L.N., Searches for an Imaginary Kingdom: The Legend of the Kingdom of Prester John Cambridge University Press. 1988. ch. 14Peter B. Golden (1992). An Introduction to the History of the Turkic People. O. Harrassowitz. p 156 Telengits certainly emerged from the mixing of Kipchak Turkic tribes with Mongols. The Telengits were dominated by the Mongols from the 13th to 18th centuries and this was followed by the brief rule of the Dzungars. During Dzungar domination, the Telengits had to pay a fur tribute or yasak to the Dzungars. In 1756, the Telengits (along with other southern Altaians) submitted to the Russians. Background and issues  Since there are many groups that live in the Altai region, it is often difficult to distinguish between the different groups. The territorial groupings are somewhat fluid. Telengits (or Telengut) live along the Chuya River in the western Altai, and call themselves Chui-kizhi (Chuya people). L. Krader. A Nativistic Movement in Western Siberia. pg 284 Sometimes they intermix with other groups that live around the river. With this intermixing, it is often difficult to establish boundaries and distinguish the individual groups. There are no sharp distinctions among the different subgroups of the Altaians, identified as they are by the territory they occupy. This inevitably caused many problems, including how to ethnically classify them. It was the political leaders of the Ulagan district who first advocated that the Telengits be recognized as a separate indigenous group in Russian law. A. Halemba. The Altai, the Altaians and the Telengits. pg 21 Before this , there was often confusion because the Telengits were classified under the Altaians. Even after the Telengits were classified as a separate group, there were still discrepancies as to what subgroups would be included under the ethnic group of the Telengits. In 2000, Telengits were listed as part of \\"Small Numbered Indigenous Peoples of the Russian Federation on the Russian and Soviet censuses\\". In 2002, they were considered their own category on the census and there were 2,398 Telengits. However, this number may be wrong because in the context of the census questions, many Telengits, 8,000 or 9,000 would consider themselves Altaians and not Telengits. In 2004, the NGO \\"Development of the Telengit People\\" was established. This group is an active part in the local political area in regard to issues of Telengit land rights.  Culture  Most Telengits used to be nomadic or semi-nomadic cattle herders. They commonly raised sheep, cattle, goats, and horses. Traditional Telengit dwellings included felt yurts. Modern Telengits live in wooden homes but commonly inhabit yurts during the summer months. Traditional Telengit dress was similar for both men and women. Traditional Telengit dress was composed of long sleeved shirts, breeches, and robes. Double-breasted sheepskin coats, fur hats, and high boots were also commonly worn. Married women additionally wore a sleeveless jacket over their coats.  Religion  Most Telengits practice shamanism but a significant amount of Telengits profess Orthodox Christianity and smaller numbers practice Burkhanism. Connection to the land The Altaians and the Telengits feel a connection to the land that they live on. They are supposed to worship their special homeland that is considered sacred. The Telengits say that if an Altaian leaves the Altai, he or she will become ill and die. This is not because of any longing or emotional distress, but because of physical separation. Halemba, Agnieszka E. “The Altai, the Altaians, and the Telengits.” The Telengits of Southern Siberia: landscape, religion and knowledge in motion. New York: Routledge, 2006. pg 18 After they have lived on the land, they become one with it. That is why it is so severe when one is separated from their homeland.

According to the 2010 census, there were 1,965 Tubalars in Russia. The villages with the highest population of Tubalars are Artybash, Iogach, Novotroitsk, Tuloi, Tondoshka, Kebezen, Ust-Pyzha, Biyka, Yailu, Chuyka, Torochak, Paspaul, Salganda, Karakoksha, Tunzha, Krasnoselskoye, Uskuch, Uimen, and Karasuk.  History  The Tubalars emerged from the mixing of Turkic tribes with Ket, Samoyed, and other native Siberian groups. This was a process that began as early as the period when the Yenisei Kyrgyz dominated the region. The Mongols then ruled over the region and people from the 13th to 18th centuries. The Dzungars than briefly controlled the area until the Tubalars (along with other Altaians) submitted to the Russians. The Tubalars consider themselves to be distinct from the other Turkic peoples in the Altai region.  Culture  The Tubalars were originally hunters and animals living in the taiga were vital to the local subsistence economy. The traditional dwellings of the Tubalars included polygonal yurts made out of bark or log and topped with a conic bark roof. Other types of dwellings also included conic yurts made out of bark or perches. Traditional Tubalar dress included short breeches, linen shirts, and single-breasted robes. A clan structure is still strongly prevalent among the modern Tubalars. The sacred tree of Tubalars is the cedar, a symbol of the power, beauty and courage of taiga. The Holiday of Cedar is a celebration of this tree.  Religion  Most Tubalars are Orthodox Christian but there is a significant minority that still practice shamanism. Burkhanism can also be found practiced by some Altaians in general.

According to the 2010 census, there were 3,608 Soyots in Russia. Their extinct language was of a Turkic type and basically similar to the Tuvans. Their language has been reconstructed and a textbook has been published. The language is currently taught in some schools in Oka. The Oka River, the largest river flowing down from the Western Sayans into the Angara is called the Ok-hem meaning \\"an arrow-river\\" by the Soyots of the Oka River basin. They live dispersed among the Buryats and now speak the Buryat language. Historical context According to Larisa R. Pavlinskaya, a Russian ethnographer based in St. Petersburg, Russia, \\"The ancestors of the Soyots (and of the closely related Tofa, Tozhu, and Dukha) were proto-Samoyedic hunter-gatherers who arrived in the Eastern Sayan region from Western Siberia at the end of the third millennium BC and the beginning of the second millennium BC.\\" In 1726 Tunka Valley Buryats spoke of a people who self- identified as Soyot but who the Buryats called Kosogol Urianghai. At that time the Soyot herded reindeer on the upper Irkut River, a river in the Buryat Republic and Irkutsk Oblast of Russia to Lake Khövsgöl, Mongolia. Approximately 350–400 years ago, the Soyot people moved to Buryatia from the area of Khovsgol Lake. The traditional lifestyle of the Soyot people, like others in the Taiga group, was characterized by reindeer-breeding and hunting but by 2009 most people were living in villages. In 1940 the Okinsky Region was designated as an aimag and officially recognized all residents of the Okinsky region as Buryat. Soyots lost their official identity as an ethnic group until 2000. Reindeer herding Bernhard Eduardovich Petri, (1884-1937) Professor of ethnology at Irkutsk University, member of the British Anthropological Society, the USSR State Academy of the History of Material Culture, and full member of the American Anthropological Association undertook research with the indigenous peoples of Siberia. In 1926 Petri led the first anthropological expedition into the Soyot reindeer-herding region. Petri described a difficult period in Russian history claiming that Soyot reindeer herding was a \\"dying branch of the economy.\\" \\"After the civil war, Petri was involved in \\"planning changes in the economic lives of minority peoples of the greater Altai-Sayan and Buryatia regions, including the nomadic reindeer- breeding Tungus (Evenki) and the Soyot and Tofalar.\\" He was wrongfully accused of \\"espionage for the British and German intelligence services, and of anti- Soviet activity, specifically establishing contacts with nationalistic representatives of the Buryat people, so-called Pan-Mongols\\" and executed in Irkutsk in 1937. Pavlinskaya argued that \\"later research and data collected from Soyot elders show that the herding tradition easily overcame the period's difficulties and endured until the middle of the 20th century, when the government interfered.\\" Sev'yan I. Vainshtein (1926–2008), a Russian ethnographer, archaeologist, historian and explorer of Siberian and Central Asian peoples and professor at the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, undertook expeditions to study reindeer-herders including the Soyot and published a number of works on the subject. Vainshtein argued that Sayan reindeer herding \\"is the oldest form of reindeer herding and is associated with the earliest domestication of the reindeer by the Samoyedic taiga population of the Sayan Mountains at the turn of the first millenium [sic] A.D...The Sayan region was apparently the origin of the economic and cultural complex of reindeer hunters-herdsmen that we now see among the various Evenki groups and the peoples of the Sayan area.\\" The Sayan ethnic groups still live almost exclusively in the area of the Eastern Sayan mountains. In 2000 reindeer peoples of Mongolia and Russia were working on collaborative efforts to rebuild reindeer-herding. Plumley suggested that the Soyot of Buryatia's Okinsky Region, the Tofalar of Irkutsk Oblast, the Tozhu Tuvans of the Republic of Tuva in Russia, and the Dukha of Mongolia's Hovsgol Province, who are \\"cultures of reindeer-habitat\\" in Central Asia may well \\"have traded, inter-married and related across the breadth and width of the Sayans.\\" Collectivization in the Union During the period of collectivization in the Soviet Union, enforced under Stalin between 1928 and 1940, the Soyot and other Siberian inhabitants were forced into a settled way of life with socialistic enterprises replacing reindeer husbandry. The Soyots were moved to Sorok, Khurga, Bokson and Orlik, the administrative center of Okinsky District. Many were moved to cattle-breeding farms and they switched to Buryat-style husbandry. Ossendowski's accounts of visiting the Soyots in the 1920s 300px Oka River is a tributary of the Angara River. In the early 1920s, Dr. Ferdinand Ossendowski, a scientist and writer, traveled through the traditional lands of the Soyot during the Russian Revolution and published a book entitled Beasts, Men and Gods in which he described his experiences.via Project Gutenberg In 1920 Ossendowski narrowly escaped being arrested by the Red Army who surrounded his house in the Siberian town of Krasnoyarsk, on the shores of the River Yenisei. He fled into the forest and lived for a while in the taiga along the shores of the Yenisei River. He and his companions followed the Tuba and Amyl Rivers to the Sayan mountains, where Urianhai, the northern part of Mongolia, begins. Urianhai is on the head waters of the Yenisei. The Soyots helped Ossendowski and his companions escape. He appreciated their hospitality. While in Urianhai, Ossendowski met Ta Lama, Prince of Soldjak and High Priest of the Buddhist Temple whose wife had red eyes. After he healed her eyes, the Prince \\"ordered one of the Soyots to guide their party to the Kosogol\\" Lake Khövsgöl. This was near the Tannu-Ola mountains. Their Soyot guide took them through the Ulaan Taiga and the Darkhad Valley where they met Soyot herdmen rapidly driving their cattle over the Darkhat plain toward the northwest into Orgarkha Ola. They communicated to us very unpleasant news. They were fleeing the Bolsheviki from the Irkutsk district who had crossed the Mongolian border and captured the Russian colony at Khathyl on the southern shore of Lake Kosogol and were continuing their advance. A Norwegian scientific expedition, led by Orjan Olsen, H. Printz, Anders K. Olsen, Fritz Jensen (Norway) and J. E. Gustschin (Russia) in the early 1910s provides information on the customs of these people before they were completely assimilated to the Buryats. The ethnographic data and photographs collected by these scientists were published by Olsen in the book: \\"Et primitivt folk de mongolske rennomader\\" (Cappeln, 1915). There is a Spanish edition: \\"Los soyotos, un pueblo primitivo. Nómadas mongoles pastores de renos\\" (Calpe, Madrid, 1921). With all its shortcomings (the book is flawed with the eurocentrism of its age), it is probably the best study of these isolated people before they adapted to the larger Buryat culture. It includes a short list of Soyot words, several dozen photographs and a fortunate preserved account of a Soyot shamanic tale of divination, along with a detailed account of both shamanic and lamaistic rituals among these people (both Buddhism and native animism syncretically coexisted at the time of the expedition). Rassadin and Soyot as an endangered language According to Valentin I. Rassadin, the Soyots spoke their own language fluently in the 1920s.(Rassadin 1996:10-22). Many Soyot married into the larger culture, the Buryats. By 1996 the language was almost lost (Rassadin 1996:10-22). Shamanism Among the various Soyot cultures, the central Soyot groups, keeping cattle and horses, show Khalkha-Mongolian phenomena in their shamanism, the shamanism of Western Soyots, living on the steppe, is similar to that of Altai Turkic peoples.Diószegi 1960:238 A shaman story narrates contacts between Soyots and Abakan Turkic peoples in a mythical form. The Karagas and Eastern (reindeer-breeding, mountain-inhabiting) Soyots have many similarities in their culture and shamanism. It was these two cultures who presented some ethnic features, phenomena lacking among neighboring Turkic peoples In a Soyot shamanic song, sounds of bird and wolf are imitated to represent helping spirits of the shaman. The book has been translated to English: According to Rassadin, Buryat Buddhist lamas attempted to put an end to Soyot shamanism (Rassadin 1996:10-22). In 2000 People's Khural (Grand Assembly) of the Republic of Buryatia changed the name of the Okinsky Region to the Soyot National Aimag at the request of government of the Okinsky Region. In 2000 the Soyot succeeded in restoring their name and identity as one of the officially recognized Indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East by decree of the Russian Government.Official is attached to: Decree of the Russian Government Nr 255 \\"On the Unified Register of Native Small-Numbered Peoples of the Russian Federation\\", 24 March 2000 (Постановление Правительства РФ от 24 марта 2000 г.

Gameplay Universal Combat offers the player a very large game world to play in using varying forms of transport and combat. The player can pilot spaceships of varying sizes, as well as land on and explore planets. On land, they can drive varying land craft. The size of the playing area is seen as one of the game's main attractions, where traveling from place to place can take considerable quantities of time as there is no time compression. The game has a high learning curve that is daunting for newer players. Every crew member aboard the player ship is tracked in location, hunger, AI level, and fatigue. Every system on board the player's starship can be monitored and controlled. In order for the player to fly a shuttle, they must first take time to walk through the ship to the shuttle bay, forcing the player to plan ahead for tactical encounters. Development The project began as early as 2000 when Derek Smart announced that he had licensed Croteam's Serious Sam game engine for \\"Project ABC\\", for \\"After Battlecruiser\\", as replacement for the Battlecruiser Tactical Engagement add-on module intended for Battlecruiser Millennium. The game's scheduled release date was in late 2001, developed for PC and Xbox. Development started in late 2001 as Battlecruiser Generations, the 5th game in the Battlecruiser series.BCG rebranded as Universal Combat As part of its design, the upcoming game was intended to make use of newer technology. With a new publisher, DreamCatcher Games, on board and offering more oversight, the direction of the game changed towards more action-based gameplay than the Battlecruiser series had previously been known for. The changes warranted a new title, and the name was changed to Universal Combat. Universal Combat was not ready in time for the 2003 holidays, despite expectations. It was shipped in early 2004 by the publisher, DreamCatcher Interactive, at half of the originally announced price. Smart pursued legal action against his publisher. A cease and desist letter was issued on behalf of 3000AD to DreamCatcher alleging, among other things, that the price reduction was \\"clearly calculated to inflict economic harm on 3000AD\\". In the hearing, DreamCatcher Interactive claimed that the game's quality did not justify a midrange price, citing the graphics as an example of the overall quality of the game. A hearing was held to determine if DreamCatcher would be prevented from shipping the title at the reduced price. The presiding judge denied the injunction, stating that 3000AD \\"made bold but unsupported assertions regarding the irreparable harm to it\\", allowing DreamCatcher Interactive to ship the game and 3000AD to proceed with their lawsuit. The matter was later settled out of court under undisclosed terms. In 2005, 3000AD, Inc. also announced termination of DreamCatcher's publishing right for Universal Combat,UC: A World Apart Gold - 3000AD vs. DC, Round II but the deal expired on 18 December 2007. When 3000AD announced they would release the game as freeware, the company reported it had told DreamCatcher to initiate a DIF (Destroy In Field) order to its various retailers so that the remaining copies can no longer be sold, and any unsold copies would be filed as losses in Q4 2007.Universal Combat Goes Freeware  Games in the series  { border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center;\\" !style=\\"background: #ececec;\\"Title  bgcolor=#ececec Released  bgcolor=#ececec Publisher - !style=\\"background: #ececec;\\" Universal Combat  bgcolor=#ddffdd  2004  bgcolor=#ddffdd  DreamCatcher Games - !style=\\"background: #ececec;\\" Universal Combat Gold  bgcolor=#ddffdd  2005  bgcolor=#ddffdd  3000AD - !style=\\"background: #ececec;\\" Universal Combat: A World Apart  bgcolor=#ddffdd  2005  bgcolor=#ddffdd  3000AD - !style=\\"background: #ececec;\\" Universal Combat: Special Edition  bgcolor=#ddffdd  2006  bgcolor=#ddffdd  3000AD - !style=\\"background: #ececec;\\" Universal Combat: Collectors Edition  bgcolor=#ddffdd  2007  bgcolor=#ddffdd  3000AD } =Universal Combat Gold= After terminating a publishing deal with DreamCatcher Interactive, Smart released an updated release titled Universal Combat Gold. Starting with this release, Smart has made a policy of releasing games through online resellers. In 2005, Turner Broadcasting licensed both Battlecruiser Millennium and Universal Combat Gold for their games-on-demand system, GameTap. Full localization supports Russian, French, Italian, German, and Spanish languages. Additional custom language interfaces are possible. =Universal Combat - A World Apart= Universal Combat - A World Apart is a sequel to the original Universal Combat games.

As a result, the publishing rights reverted to 3000AD Inc. As a result of the termination, the boxed version of the game was not released, and the developer also removed DreamCatcher-created content from the retail game. Although the game had switched to DirectX 9, graphics improvements only began in this edition.

He served as leader of the Alberta Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the mayor of Edmonton, and a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. He was also a candidate for the House of Commons of Canada. Early life Roper was born in Ingonish, Nova Scotia, the son of a sea captain. He was educated in Sydney, and moved west to Calgary, Alberta in 1907. There he apprenticed as a printer and found work in the Calgary Herald's press room. On June 15, 1914, he married Goldie C. Bell, with whom he would have three daughters and one son and who would predecease him by weeks. He became involved in the labour movement as a young man, and was president of the Calgary Trades & Labour Council by 1916. His tenure in this position was short-lived, as he moved to Edmonton the following year to become the head of the Edmonton Bulletin's press room. There he took a position of leadership in running the Edmonton District Labour Council (later the Edmonton Trades & Labour Council), and was involved in the 1919 strike (a sympathy strike with the Winnipeg General Strike). In 1921 he left the Bulletin to found his own printing business, which he would operate until his retirement. The same year, he made his first bid for elected office. Early political career In the 1921 provincial election, Roper ran as a Labour candidate in Edmonton. He finished thirteenth of twenty-six candidates.Monto, Tom. Protest and Progress. Three Labour Radicals in Early Edmonton, Crang Publishing, Alhambra Books (Edmonton), p. 86 In 1922, Roper became secretary-treasurer of the Alberta Federation of Labour. He would hold the position for a decade. Roper edited the AF of L's official organ Alberta Labour News from 1921 to 1935when he changed the newspaper's name to People's Weekly and made it the de facto house organ of the new Alberta Co-operative Commonwealth Federation with William Irvine as co-editor.Finkel, Alvin, \\"Alberta\\" in Heaps, Leo, Our Canada, 1991 Roper ran for school trustee in Edmonton's 1924 municipal election. He finished fourth of seven candidates, in an election in which the top three candidates were elected. He tried again the next year's election, and again finished fourth of seven candidates; however, the board's staggered electoral system meant that, though only three of the board's seven trustees had been elected in 1924, four were up for election in 1924 and Roper was elected. He was re-elected in 1927 but did not seek re-election at the expiration of his second term. He continued to seek office at other levels. In the 1926 provincial election, he was again a Labour candidate in Edmonton. He was less successful on this occasion, finishing sixteenth of eighteen candidates on the first ballot. He tried again in a 1931 by-election resulting from the death of Charles Weaver; he finished second of four candidates as Conservative Frederick C. Jamieson reclaimed the seat for Weaver's party. Roper's lone attempt at federal office took place in the 1935 election, when he ran for the newly formed Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in Edmonton East; he finished fourth of six candidates as William Samuel Hall took the riding for the Social Credit Party of Canada. Roper had joined the CCF at the provincial level as well and ran under its banner in the 1940 election, finishing seventh of nineteen candidates on the first ballot and being defeated once again. No CCF members were elected during that election but that was about to change. CCF leader and MLA On May 4, 1942 Conservative leader David Duggan died, and his Edmonton seat became vacant. Roper was nominated as the CCF's candidate in the ensuing by-election and came out on top of a five-person field. CCF leader Chester Ronning quickly stepped aside to hand the leadership to the party's first MLA. Elmer Roper would be leader of the CCF for thirteen years, but he would not have to sit as its lone MLA that long: after the 1944 election, he was joined in the legislature by Aylmer Liesemer of Calgary. Two seats would be as high as the CCF would climb during Roper's tenure as its leader. Both incumbents were re-elected in the 1948 election, but the party's share of the vote fell from 25% to 19%, and Roper did not add any new MLAs to his tiny caucus as Social Credit's stranglehold over the province remained intact. He did get a new MLA after the 1952 election - Willingdon's Nick Dushenski - but this gain was cancelled by Liesemer's defeat. Worse, the CCF's vote fell further, to 14%, and the Alberta Liberal Party doubled its seat count to four, making it clearly the official opposition and leaving the CCF as the third party. Things then got worse for Roper. In the 1955 election, the CCF's share of the vote was only 8% and the previously dormant Conservatives passed it in the seat count. Moreover, Roper himself lost his seat in Edmonton (although Dusehsnki was returned and Stanley Ruzycki was elected in Vegreville). Roper placed third of thirty candidates on the first ballot, but as Premier Ernest Manning's large number of surplus votes was redistributed to the riding's other Social Credit candidates (and James Harper Prowse's only slightly smaller surplus was redistributed to other Liberals, Roper fell out of the top seven, where he needed to remain in order to be re-elected. Following the election, Roper relinquished the CCF leadership. He would never again seek provincial office. Municipal politics In advance of the 1959 municipal election, the city's mayoralty was up for grabs. William Hawrelak had resigned in scandal, and the man that the Edmonton City Council had chosen to replace him, Frederick John Mitchell, had decided to return to his aldermanic post rather than contest the mayoral election. Roper chose to contest it, and defeated three candidates (most notably his former legislature colleague James Prowse). He was re-elected in the 1961 election, handily defeating alderman Ed Leger, but did not seek re-election at the conclusion of his second term. At the age of seventy, he was finished with politics. Later life, death, and legacy Elmer Roper retired to Victoria, British Columbia in 1975, and died there November 12, 1994. His wife had died in August, just after the couple's eightieth anniversary, and he was survived by two daughters and a son, former Edmonton alderman G Lyall Roper. He had been made an honorary life member of the Rotary Club in 1928, and had received an honorary doctorate in laws from the University of Alberta in 1959. Additionally, Roper Road and Roper Industrial, an Edmonton road and neighbourhood respectively, are named in his honour.

The debate on the origins of the Holocaust centres on essentially two questions: *Was there a master plan on the part of Adolf Hitler to launch the Holocaust? Intentionalists argue there was such a plan, while functionalists argue there was not. *Did the initiative for the Holocaust come from above with orders from Adolf Hitler or from below within the ranks of the German bureaucracy? Although neither side disputes the reality of the Holocaust, nor is there serious dispute over the premise that Hitler (as Führer) was personally responsible for encouraging the anti- Semitism that allowed the Holocaust to take place, intentionalists argue the initiative came from above, while functionalists contend it came from lower ranks within the bureaucracy. The terms were coined in a 1981 essay by the British Marxist historian Timothy Mason.: \\"The terms 'intentionalist' and 'functionalist' were coined by Tim Mason, 'Intention and Explanation: A Current Controversy about the Interpretation of National Socialism,' Der Führerstaat: Mythos und Realität, ed. Gerhard Hirschfeld and Lothar Kettenacker (Stuttgart, 1981), 21-40. Prime examples of the two interpretive approaches can be seen in the articles by Klaus Hildebrand and Hans Mommsen in the same volume.\\" Notable functionalists have included Timothy Mason, Raul Hilberg, Karl Schleunes, Christopher Browning, Hans Mommsen, Martin Broszat, Götz Aly, Yehuda Bauer and Zygmunt Bauman. Notable intentionalists have included Gerald Fleming, Karl Dietrich Bracher, Andreas Hillgruber, Klaus Hildebrand, Eberhard Jäckel, Gerhard Weinberg, Walter Laqueur, Saul Friedländer, Richard Breitman, Lucy Dawidowicz and Daniel Jonah Goldhagen. Origins of the debate The search for the origins of the Holocaust began almost as soon as World War II ended. At the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials of 1945–46, the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question in Europe\\" was represented by the prosecution as part of the long-term plan on the part of the Nazi leadership going back to the foundations of the Nazi Party in 1919. Subsequently, most historians subscribed to what would be nowadays considered to be the extreme intentionalist interpretation. Books such as Karl Schleunes' The Twisted Road to Auschwitz which was published in 1970 influenced a number of historians to challenge the prevailing interpretation and suggested there was no master plan for the Holocaust. In the 1970s, advocates of the intentionalist school of thought were known as \\"the straight road to Auschwitz\\" camp or as the \\"programmists\\", because they insisted that Hitler was fulfilling a programme. Advocates of the functionalist school were known as \\"the twisted road to Auschwitz\\" camp or as the \\"structuralists\\", because of their insistence that it was the internal power structures of the Third Reich that led to the Holocaust. In 1981, the British historian Timothy Mason published an essay entitled \\"Intention and Explanation\\" that was in part an attack on the scholarship of Karl Dietrich Bracher and Klaus Hildebrand, both of whom Mason accused of focusing too much on Adolf Hitler as an explanation of the Holocaust. In this essay, Mason called the followers of \\"the twisted road to Auschwitz\\"/structuralist school \\"functionalists\\" because of their belief that the Holocaust arose as part of the functioning of the Nazi state, while the followers of \\"the straight road to Auschwitz\\"/programmist school were called \\"intentionalists\\" because of their belief that it was Hitler's intentions alone that explained the Holocaust. The terms \\"intentionalist\\" and \\"functionalist\\" have largely replaced the previous terms used to signify the conflicting schools of thought.  Debate  Those historians who take an intentionalist line, like Andreas Hillgruber, argue that everything that happened after Operation Barbarossa was part of a masterplan he credited Hitler with developing in the 1920s. Hillgruber wrote in his 1967 book Germany and the Two World Wars that for Hitler: The German historian Helmut Krausnick argued that: Streim wrote in response that Krausnick had been taken in by the line invented after the war to reduce the responsibility of the Einsatzgruppen leaders brought to trial. Klaus Hildebrand wrote that: Against the intentionalist interpretation, functionalist historians like Martin Broszat argued that the lower officials of the Nazi state had started exterminating people on their own initiative. Broszat argued that the Holocaust began \\"bit by bit\\" as German officials stumbled into genocide. Broszat argued that in the autumn of 1941 German officials had begun \\"improvised\\" killing schemes as the \\"simplest\\" solution to the \\"Jewish Question\\". In Broszat's opinion, Hitler subsequently approved of the measures initiated by the lower officials and allowed the expansion of the Holocaust from Eastern Europe to all of Europe. In this way, Broszat argued that the Shoah was not begun in response to an order, written or unwritten, from Hitler but was rather “a way out of the blind alley into which the Nazis had manoeuvred themselves”. The American historian Christopher Browning has argued that: By contrast, the Swiss historian Philippe Burrin argues that such a decision was not made before August 1941 at the earliest, pointing to orders given by Himmler on 30 July 1941 to the 2nd SS Cavalry Regiment and the SS Cavalry Brigade operating in the Pripet Marshes in the Pripyat operation calling for the murder of male Jews only while the Jewish women and children were to be driven into the Marshes. Browning argues that sometime in mid-July 1941 Hitler made the decision to begin general genocide owing to his exhilaration over his victories over the Red Army, whereas Burrin contends that the decision was made in late August 1941 owing to Hitler's frustration over the slowing down of the Wehrmacht. Kershaw argues that the dramatic expansion in both the range of victims and the intensity of the killings after mid-August 1941 indicates that Hitler issued an order to that effect, most probably a verbal order conveyed to the Einsatzgruppen commanders through either Himmler or Heydrich. It remains unclear whether that was a decision made on Hitler's own initiative motivated only by his own anti-Semitic prejudices, or (impressed with the willingness and ability of Einsatzgruppe A to murder Jewish women and children) ordered that the other three Einsatzgruppen emulate Einsatzgruppe A's bloody example. The Canadian historian Erich Haberer has contended that the \\"Baltic flashpoint of genocide\\", as the killings committed by Einsatzgruppe A between July–October 1941 are known to historians, were the key development in the evolution of Nazi anti-Semitic policy that resulted in the Holocaust. The Baltic area witnessed both the most extensive and intense killings of all the Einsatzgruppen with 90,000–100,000 Jews killed between July and October 1941, which led to the almost total destruction of the Jewish communities in that area. Haberer maintains that the \\"Baltic flashpoint of genocide\\" occurred at time when the other Nazi plans for a \\"territorial final solution\\" such as the Madagascar Plan were unlikely to occur, and thus suggested to the Nazi leadership that genocide was indeed \\"feasible\\" as a \\"final solution to the Jewish Question\\". FunctionalismExtreme= Extreme functionalists such as Götz Aly believe that the Nazi leadership had nothing to do with initiating the Holocaust and that the entire initiative came from the lower ranks of the German bureaucracy. This philosophy is what is known as the bottom-up approach of the Holocaust. Aly has made much of documents from the bureaucracy of the German Government-General of Poland arguing that the population of Poland would have to decrease by 25% to allow the Polish economy to grow. Criticism centers on the idea that this explanation does not really show why the Nazis would deport Jews from France and the Netherlands to death camps in Poland if it was Poland the Nazis were concerned with, and why the Jews of Poland were targeted instead of the random sample of 25% of the Polish population. Additional criticism of functionalism points out that Hitler and other Nazi leaders delayed railcars providing supplies to front line troops in the Soviet Union so that Jews could be deported by rail from the USSR to death camps thus demonstrating the pursuit of genocidal policies over pragmatic wartime actions. =Moderate= Moderate functionalists, such as Karl Schleunes and Christopher Browning, believe that the rivalry within the unstable Nazi power structure provided the major driving force behind the Holocaust. Moderate functionalists believe that the Nazis aimed to expel all of the Jews from Europe, but only after the failure of these schemes did they resort to genocide. This is sometimes referred to as the \\"twisted road\\" to genocide, after a book by Schleunes called The Twisted Road to Auschwitz. IntentionalismExtreme= Extreme intentionalists believe that Hitler definitely had plans for the Holocaust by 1924, if not earlier. Dawidowicz argued that Hitler already decided upon the Holocaust no later than 1919. To support her interpretation, Dawidowicz pointed to numerous extreme anti-Semitic statements made by Hitler. Criticism has centered on the fact that none of these statements refer to killing the entire Jewish people; indeed, very few refer to killing Jews at all. Only once in Mein Kampf does Hitler ever refer to killing Jews, when he states \\"If at the beginning of the war and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas, as happened to hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers in the field, the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.\\" Given that Mein Kampf is 694 pages long, Dawidowicz's critics contend, she makes too much of one sentence. Daniel Goldhagen went further, suggesting that popular opinion in Germany was already sympathetic to a policy of Jewish extermination before the Nazi party came to power. He asserts in his book Hitler's Willing Executioners that Germany enthusiastically welcomed the persecution of Jews by the Nazi regime in the period 1933–39. =Moderate= Moderate intentionalists such as Richard Breitman believe that Hitler had decided upon the Holocaust sometime in the late 1930s and certainly no later than 1939 or 1941. This school makes much of Hitler's \\"Prophecy Speech\\" of January 30, 1939 before the Reichstag where Hitler stated \\"If the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once again into a world war, then the result will not be the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!\\"Domarus (1990). Hitler Speeches and Proclamations, 1932–1945. [Vols. 1–4], p. 1449. The major problem with this thesis, as Yehuda Bauer points out, is that though this statement clearly commits Hitler to genocide, he made no effort after delivering this speech to have it carried out. Furthermore, Ian Kershaw has pointed out that there are several diary entries by Joseph Goebbels in late 1941, in which Goebbels writes that \\"the Führer's prophecy is coming true in a most terrible way.\\" The general impression one gets is that Goebbels is quite surprised that Hitler was serious about carrying out the threat in the \\"Prophecy Speech.\\" Synthesis A number of scholars such as Arno J. Mayer, Peter Longerich, Ian Kershaw and Michael Marrus have developed a synthesis of the functionalist and intentionalist schools. They have suggested the Holocaust was a result of pressures that came from both above and below and that Hitler lacked a master plan, but was the decisive force behind the Holocaust. The phrase 'cumulative radicalisation' is used in this context to sum up the way extreme rhetoric and competition among different Nazi agencies produced increasingly extreme policies, as fanatical bureaucratic underlings put into practice what they believed Hitler would have approved based on his widely disseminated speeches and propaganda. This phenomenon is referred to more generally in social psychology as groupshift. Given the fact that scholars have written so much in relation to Nazi Germany, Richard Bessel asserts that, \\"The result is a much better informed, much more detailed and more nuanced picture of the Nazi regime, and most serious historians of the Nazi regime now are to some extent both 'intentionalists' and 'functionalists'—insofar as those terms still can be used at all.\\"Richard Bessel, \\"Functionalists vs. Intentionalists: The Debate Twenty Years on or Whatever Happened to Functionalism and Intentionalism?\\" German Studies Review 26, no. 1 (2003): p. 16.

They live mostly in Turkey, Egypt and in Karachay-Cherkessia and Stavropol Krai in the North Caucasus region of Russia. The Tapanta (:ru:Тапанта), a branch of the Abaza, lived between the Besleney and Kabardian princedoms on the upper Kuban. The Abazin originally inhabited the Sadzen region in the western part of Abkhazia and migrated from Abkhazia to Abazinia in 14th and 15th centuries. They later migrated to various regions of the former Ottoman Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since the late 18th century, their dominant religion is Sunni Islam (Hanafi). Abaza people speak the Abaza language, a Northwest Caucasian language closely related to Abkhaz and Circassian. There are two dialects of Abaza spoken in Karachay-Cherkessia: Ashkharua and Tapanta. The culture and traditions of the Abazin are similar to those of the Circassians. On many old maps Abazin territory is marked as part of Circassia (Adygea). According to the 2010 Russian census, there were 43,341 Abazins in Russia.  Diaspora  An Abazin diaspora exists in Turkey, Egypt and in Middle Eastern countries such as Jordan and Syria, most of which are descendants of muhajirs from the Caucasian War with the Russian Empire. There is a significant Abazin presence in Turkey. An estimated 150,000 Abaza live in the provinces of Eskişehir, Samsun, Yozgat, Adana and Kayseri. Most of them belong to Ashkharua clan that fought against the Tsarist army and emigrated to Turkey after losing the battle of Kbaada (Krasnaya Polyana in today's Sochi), whereas the Tapanta clan fought with the Russian forces. A prominent example in Egypt is the Abaza family, a large Abazin clan. The Abaza family still holds to this day an élite place in Egyptian society and constitutes Egypt's largest family, with well over 15,000 members active in all aspects of society.

A work of electronic literature can be defined as \\"a construction whose literary aesthetics emerge from computation\\", \\"work that could only exist in the space for which it was developed/written/coded—the digital space\\". This means that these writings cannot be easily printed, or cannot be printed at all, because elements crucial to the text are unable to be carried over onto a printed version. The digital literature world continues to innovate print's conventions all the while challenging the boundaries between digitized literature and electronic literature. Some novels are exclusive to tablets and smartphones for the simple fact that they require a touchscreen. Digital literature tends to require a user to traverse through the literature through the digital setting, making the use of the medium part of the literary exchange. Espen J. Aarseth wrote in his book Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature that \\"it is possible to explore, get lost, and discover secret paths in these texts, not metaphorically, but through the topological structures of the textual machinery\\". Definitions It is difficult to accurately define electronic literature. The phrase itself consists of two words, each with their own specific meanings. Arthur Krystal in What Is Literature explains that \\"lit(t)eratura referred to any writing formed with letters\\". However, Krystal goes on to explore what literature has transformed into: \\"a record of one human being's sojourn on earth, proffered in verse or prose that artfully weaves together knowledge of the past with a heightened awareness of the present in ever new verbal configurations\\". Electronic denotes anything \\"of, relating to, or being a medium...by which information is transmitted electronically\\". Thus electronic literature can be considered a branch from the main tree of literature. Katherine Hayles discusses the topic in the online article Electronic Literature: What Is It. She argues \\"electronic literature, generally considered to exclude print literature that has been digitized, is by contrast 'digital born', and (usually) meant to be read on a computer\\". A definition offered by the Electronic Literature Organization (ELO) states electronic literature \\"refers to works with an important literary aspect that takes advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer\\". On its official website, the ELO offers this additional definition of electronic literature as consisting of works which are: * E-books, hypertext and poetry, on and off of the Web * Animated poetry presented in graphical forms, for example Flash and other platforms * Computer art installations, which ask viewers to read them or otherwise have literary aspects * Conversational characters, also known as chatterbots * Interactive * Novels that take the form of emails, SMS messages, or blogs * Poems and stories that are generated by computers, either interactively or based on parameters given at the beginning * Collaborative writing projects that allow readers to contribute to the text of a work * Literary performances online that develop new ways of writing * Video Novel which combines audio, text, images and video to create vertical content for mobiles and tablets. While the ELO definition incorporates many aspects that are applied in digital literature, the definition lacks any solid guidelines and also fails to recognize literature created on social media platforms including Twitterature. With the apparent vagueness, many debate on what truly qualifies as a piece of e-literature. A large number of works fall through the cracks of the imprecise characteristics that generally make up electronic literature. History A gradual transition into the digital world began with new advancements in technology to makes things more efficient and accessible. This is comparable to the release of the printing press in the 15th century, as people did not consider it a major contributor to literature at first. In the 1960s and 1970s, the creation of the personal computer allowed people to begin expanding literature into the electronic realm. =Predecessors= In 1877, spoken word recordings began with the invention of the phonograph.Matthew Rubery, ed. (2011). \\"Introduction\\". Audiobooks, Literature, and Sound Studies. Routledge. pp. 1–21. In the 1930s, the first \\"talking book\\" recordings were made to hold short stories and book chapters.Aarseth, Espen J. Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1997 The 1970s were when the term \\"audiobook\\" became part of the vernacular as cassette tapes entered the public.Barnet, Belinda. \\"Machine Enhanced (Re)minding: The Development of Storyspace.\\" 1971 was the year officially accepted as the year of the first e-book. Although there were several contenders to the invention of an \\"electronic book\\" prior to this, Michael Hart, the founder of the Gutenberg Project, has been accepted as the official inventor of the e-book after creating a digital copy of the Declaration of Independence. =Early history= In 1975–76, Will Crowther programmed a text game named Colossal Cave Adventure (also known as Adventure). Considered one of the earlier computer adventure games, it possessed a story that had the reader make choices on which way to go. These choices could lead the reader to the end, or to his or her untimely death. This non-linear format was later mimicked by the text adventure game, Zork, created by a group of MIT students in 1977–79. These two games are considered to be the first examples of interactive fiction as well as some of the earliest video games. The earliest pieces of electronic literature as presently defined were created using Storyspace, software developed by Jay David Bolter and Michael Joyce in the 1980s.Bolter, J. David and Michael Joyce (1987). \\"Hypertext and Creative Writing\\", Proceedings of ACM Hypertext 1987, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States, pages 41-50 They sold the software in 1990 to Eastgate Systems, a small software company that has maintained and updated the code in Storyspace up to the present. Storyspace and other similar programs use hypertext to create links within text. Literature using hypertext is frequently referred to as hypertext fiction. Originally, these stories were often disseminated on discs and later on CD. Hypertext fiction is still being created today using not only Storyspace, but other programs such as Twine. =Modern= While hypertext fiction is still being made and interactive fiction created with text stories and images, there is a discussion over the term, \\"literature\\" being used to describe video games. Though Adventure and Zork are considered video games, advancements in technology have evolved video gaming mediums from text to action and back to text. More often than not, video games are told as interactive literature where the player makes choices and alters the outcome of the story. The video game Mass Effects story is entirely based around these choices, and Mass Effect 3 is an even better example, changing character interactions with the player character and how the game ends is based on the player's actions. In other instances the games are a story and the player exists to move the plot along. Journey, a game by Thatgamecompany released in 2012 for the PlayStation 3, is more story than game. The titular \\"journey\\" is the trek the player takes from start to finish as a character with limited mobility and world interaction. While the player can play with one other player at a time on the network, they cannot communicate through traditional means. With no actual words, this game takes the player through a world from prologue to epilogue. In Espen Aarseth's Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature, he defines \\"ergodic literature\\" as literature where \\"nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text\\". An example from Aarseth states, \\"Since writing always has been a spatial activity, it is reasonable to assume that ergodic textuality has been practiced as long as linear writing. For instance, the wall inscriptions of the temples in ancient Egypt were often connected two-dimensionally (on one wall) or three- dimensionally (from wall to wall and from room to room), and this layout allowed a nonlinear arrangement of the religious text in accordance with the symbolic architectural layout of the temple.\\" Using these examples hypertext fiction and interactive fiction can be considered ergodic literature, and under the umbrella of interactive fiction, so can video games. Electronic literature continues to evolve. Preservation and archiving Electronic literature, according to Hayles, becomes unplayable after a decade or less due to the \\"fluid nature of media\\". Therefore, electronic literature risks losing the opportunity to build the \\"traditions associated with print literature\\".4 Preservation, Archiving, and Dissemination, Electronic Literature: What is it? On the other hand, classics such as Michael Joyce's afternoon, a story (1987) are still read and have been republished on CD, while simple HTML hypertext fictions from the 1990s are still accessible online and can be read in modern browsers. Several organizations are dedicated to preserving works of electronic literature. The UK-based Digital Preservation Coalition aims to preserve digital resources in general, while the Electronic Literature Organization's PAD (Preservation / Archiving / Dissemination) initiative gave recommendations on how to think ahead when writing and publishing electronic literature, as well as how to migrate works running on defunct platforms to current technologies.Montfort, Nick and Noah Wardrip-Fruin \\"Acid-Free Bits: Recommendations for Long-Lasting Electronic Literature\\".

Quin, Jean-Hugues Réty, and Noah Wardrip-Fruin. \\"2005 \\"Born-Again Bits: A Framework for Migrating Electronic Literature\\". Electronic Literature Organization, 2005. The Electronic Literature Collection is a series of anthologies of electronic literature published by the Electronic Literature Organization, both on CD/DVD and online, and this is another strategy in working to make sure that electronic literature is available for future generations. The Maryland Institute for Technologies in the Humanities and the Electronic Literature Lab at Washington State University - Vancouver also work towards the documentation and preservation of electronic literature and hypermedia. Notable people and works Noteworthy authors, critics, and works associated with electronic literature include: Robert Coover, a professor of creative writing at Brown University, helped bring Talan Memmott to the university as its first graduate fellow of electronic writing. Pry, a novella, a collaboration between Danny Cannizzaro and Samantha Gorman (also known as Tender Claws). It is an electronic literature application for phones and tablets. By utilizing the touch-based gestures used on tablets, Pry proves to be a very dynamic approach to the emerging e-lit genre. The use of these gestures allow the reader to dig beneath the story at the surface of Pry. Game, game, game and again game (2008), Nothing you have done deserves such praise (2013), I made this. you play this. we are enemies (2009), and Scrape Scraperteeth (2011) are important examples of the intersection of games and poetry. They are created by digital poet and net-artist Jason Nelson whose career has been devoting to exploring interface, interactivity, and surrealism within electronic literature.

Heat distillation removes water vapour and volatile organic compounds (syngas) from the matrix. The residual black carbon material is char, as distinguished from the lighter colored ash. By the action of heat, charring removes hydrogen and oxygen from the solid, so that the remaining char is composed primarily of carbon. Polymers like thermoset, or most solid organic compounds like wood or biological tissue, exhibit charring behaviour. Charring means partially burning so as to blacken the surface. Charring can result from naturally occurring processes like fire; it is also a deliberate and controlled reaction used in the manufacturing of certain products. The mechanism of charring is part of the normal burning of certain solid fuels like wood. During normal combustion, the volatile compounds created by charring are consumed at the flames within the fire or released to the atmosphere, while combustion of char can be seen as glowing red coals or embers which burn without the presence of flames.  Production of char  charcoal-burner tending his charcoal clamp, in which he is producing charcoal. The process takes days, and the clamp has to be monitored to stop the fire from breaking out (technically, the oxygen from breaking in). Coke and charcoal are both produced by charring, whether on an industrial scale or through normal combustion of coal or wood. Normal combustion consumes the char as well as the gases produced in its creation, while industrial processes seek to recover the purified char with minimal loss to combustion. This is accomplished by either burning the parent fuel (wood or coal) in a low-oxygen environment or by heating it to a high temperature without allowing combustion to occur. In industrial production of coke and charcoal the volatile compounds driven off during charring are often captured for use in other chemical processes. A \\"coal burning\\" blacksmith's forge actually produces the heat necessary for high-temperature metalworking by the continuous production and consumption of coke within a carefully managed fire. An inner ring of burning coke provides heat which converts the encircling coal into coke, which is then itself fed into the center of the fire to provide the required heat and to create more coke; coal itself is incapable of producing the heat required for some blacksmithing operations.  Charring and fire protection  Charring is an important process in the combustion ignition of solid fuels and in smouldering. In construction of heavy-timbered wood buildings the predictable formation of char is used to determine the fire rating of supporting timbers and is an important consideration in fire protection engineering. If a wood column is of large enough diameter, during a structure fire its exposed surface will be converted to char until the thickness of char provides sufficient insulation to prevent additional charring. This layer then serves to protect the remaining structurally sound core of wood, which can continue to carry the building loads if appropriately designed. Traditional houses in Naoshima, Kagawa clad with yakisugi panels  Wood preservation  Charring is also a technique used for wood preservation. In Japan this traditional technique is called yakisugi or shō sugi ban.  Legal definitions  Charring had a special meaning under the common law of England. Under that system, the crime of arson required charring of a dwelling—actual damage to the fiber of the material from which the structure was built—and not mere \\"scorching\\" or damage to the surface, or to surface coverings such as carpets and wallpaper.

Following the custom of European Chassidic Courts, where the Rebbe was called after the name of his city, the Bostoner branch of Hasidic Judaism was named after Boston, Massachusetts. The most senior and well-known of the Bostoner Rebbes in contemporary times was Grand Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Horowitz, who died in December 2009. Amid a spectrum of notable accomplishments and \\"firsts in America,\\" Bostoner Hasidim claim to be skilled in applying ancient Jewish values in modern society, engaging in outreach to students, and providing tangible help for the sick and their families during crucial times of need. Bostoner Hasidim also pride themselves on their musical tradition. The worldwide community of Bostoner Hasidism has headquarters in Brookline, Massachusetts and Har Nof, Israel, with additional branches in Beit Shemesh, Israel; Beitar Illit, West Bank; Flatbush, Brooklyn; Highland Park, New Jersey; Lawrence, Nassau County, New York; and Monsey, New York. Origins The Israel Boston Chassidic Center on Ruzhin Street, Har Nof, Jerusalem Grand Rabbi Pinchas David Horowitz, the first Bostoner Rebbe, a scion of Shmelke of Nikolsburg and the Lelov dynasty, was born in Jerusalem in Ottoman Syria. He first arrived in Boston in 1915 from the Russian Empire, where he had gone to collect charity. Shortly after his arrival, Rabbi Pinchas David was accepted as Rebbe by a group of followers he attracted from within the Boston Jewish community. However, in 1939, he left Boston and moved to Brooklyn where he opened the Bostoner beth midrash of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. After his death in 1941, his older son, Rav Moshe, succeeded him in New York, while his younger son, Levi Yitzchak Horowitz, moved back to Boston in 1943 and built the New England Chassidic Center. In his lifetime, Reb Moshe founded the Bostoner beth midrash of Crown Heights, Brooklyn and the Bostoner beth midrash of Borough Park, Brooklyn. In 1985, upon the passing of Reb Moshe, his eldest son, Chaim Avrom Horowitz, succeeded him as Bostoner Rebbe of New York. In 1989, Reb Moshe's younger son, Pinchas Dovid, moved to Flatbush, Brooklyn to establish a community there. He eventually accepted the mantle of Bostoner Rebbe of Flatbush. In 2006, Rav Chaim Avrom moved to Beit Shemesh in Israel to establish a community there. He died in 2016 while visiting America for his granddaughter's wedding to the grandson of the Skverer and Rachmanstrifker Rebbes. He was succeeded by his sons, Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak Horowitz of Lawrence, NY, And Rav Yisrael Yona Horowitz of Boro Park. In the mid 1980s, Levi Yitzchak Horowitz established another Boston community in Har Nof, Jerusalem, and would spend half of the year in Boston and half of the year in Jerusalem. On Saturday, December 5, 2009 Levi Yitzchok Horowitz died in Jerusalem, survived by his three sons and two daughters. In his spiritual will, the title of Grand Rabbi of Boston was bestowed upon all three surviving sons. Pinchas Dovid Horowitz, the Chuster Rebbe of Borough Park, the oldest, serves as Bostoner Rebbe in New York; Mayer Alter Horowitz serves as Bostoner Rebbe in Har Nof; and Naftali Yehuda Horowitz, the youngest, serves as Bostoner Rebbe in Boston.

Early life and family Guilfoyle was born in Chelsea, England, to Charlotte (née Delafosse) and Michael Guilfoyle (1809–1884), a landscape gardener and nurseryman. William was one of four children. The family migrated to Sydney in 1849 on board the Steadfast.http://indexes.records.nsw.gov.au/ebook/list.aspx?series=NRS5316&item;=4_4786&ship;=Steadfast Later after arriving, Michael Guilfoyle established Guilfoyle's Exotic Nursery in Double Bay on land owned by Thomas Sutcliffe Mort. Here he was a leading supplier of the exotic Jacaranda tree using his own grafting methods.http://www.woollahra.nsw.gov.au/library/local_history/woollahra_plaque_scheme/winners_plaques/michael_guilfoyle William Guilfoyle was privately educated at Lyndhurst College, Glebe where he received botanical instruction by William Woolls, William Sharp MacLeay (1792–1865) and John MacGillivray (1821–1867), who all encouraged him to follow in his father's career. In 1868 William Guilfoyle was appointed to the scientific staff of HMS Challenger that travelled around the Pacific Ocean. He recorded the voyage with a series of watercolour sketches and a detailed account in the Sydney Mail.Almond, E. (2002), 'Guilfoyle, William Robert', in R. Aitken and M. Looker (eds), Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens, South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, pp. 281–83. Guilfoyle settled in the Tweed River valley where he grew tobacco and sugar cane and first met the noted German botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller. Melbourne Botanic Gardens In April 1873 Mueller created the genus Guilfoylia and described William Guilfoyle as \\"distinguished as a collector [who] evidenced great ardour\\" and held high hopes for his collecting ability. Mueller's opinion changed when Guilfoyle was appointed to take his place as Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne on 21 July 1873. He accused Guilfoyle of being a \\"nurseryman [with] no claims to scientific knowledge whatever\\" and of getting the job due to being related to the wife of the responsible Minister. Mueller subsequently abolished Guilfoylia as part of the genus of Cadellia in his botanical census of 1882. Mueller had adopted a scientific and educational approach to the Botanic Gardens, which had come in for criticism by influential Melburnians, who wanted a more aesthetic gardens for recreational use. William Guilfoyle set about creating the Gardens' world-famous \\"picturesque\\" landscape style. Over the next 35 years, Guilfoyle sculpted sweeping lawns, meandering paths and glittering lakes, creating a series of vistas offering a surprise around every corner. The swamp and lagoon were separated from the Yarra River under the direction of Carlo Catani (1852–1918), a civil engineer with the Public Works Department, allowing Guilfoyle to create the chain of ornamental lakes further adding to the beauty of the gardens. A feature of Guilfoyle's designs were the erection of over a dozen structures in the Gardens, including pavilions, summer houses, rotundas and 'temples'. These structures were generally located at junctions along the path system and took advantage of an attractive view. They were also practical buildings providing much needed shelter from Melbourne's hot summer sun and unpredictable rain. The Rose Pavilion, for instance, was used for band recitals during the summer months.Duxbury, K. (2005), 'Postcard memories or more?', Australian Garden History, 17 (1), pp. 15–20. Another, the \\"Temple of the Winds\\" monument was dedicated to Governor Charles La Trobe and erected by William Guilfoyle in the Botanical Gardens. The temple is composed of 10 columns instead of the normal 8 or 12 which are more easily divisible by the four points of the compass. According to historian Ken Duxbury, such structures added a picturesque charm to the landscape, highlighting points of visual interest along the trail of the paths and serving a role not dissimilar to the grottos, classical temples, follies, hermitages and pagodas along the circuit walks of the classic 'English Landscape School' gardens such as Stourhead. In addition to these structures, Guilfoyle added a series of large iron archways to highlight entry to the rest houses and to mark points of transition like 'doorways'. About ten of these archways still remain. He also established an extensive medicinal garden in the 1880s at the Gardens and opened a Museum of Economic Botany and Plant Products in 1892. Public parks in Melbourne Other public work included additional tree planting and landscaping of Kings Domain and refining the original garden design of Government House \\"with many fine mature trees, including conifers, Australian rainforest species and deciduous trees, which are characteristic of the era and which also reflect Guilfoyle's personal taste\\" (Victorian Heritage register). The Carlton Gardens, now a World Heritage Site, was landscaped for the Melbourne International Exhibition held in 1880 by several leading landscape designers and horticulturists including Clement Hodgkinson, William Sangster, Nicholas Bickford, and William Guilfoyle. The gardens at Aspendale Racecourse were designed by William Guilfoyle. In 1902 William Guilfoyle transformed the ornamental pond in the Treasury Gardens into a Japanese Garden, however the garden was demolished after the Second World War. Regional botanic gardens Shortly after completing the major landscaping of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne in 1879, Guilfoyle designed several Botanic gardens in regional Victorian towns: * Camperdown Botanic gardens which now features an arboretum, rare examples of Himalayan oak and a statue of Scottish poet Robbie Burns, which once stood at Tydenham Castle, near London. Several street-tree elm plantings in Camperdown were designed by Guilfoyle. * Colac Botanic gardens in Queen street located on the shores of Lake Colac, were established in 1868, remodelled in 1910 by Guilfoyle and include a huge diversity of plants with many old and rare trees and a rose arbour. * Hamilton Botanic gardens from 1881. Set in four acres (16,000 m²), the gardens are distinguished by rare botanic species, a superbly restored rotunda, a small zoo and playground and the ornate Thomson Fountain. The National Trust of Australia classified the gardens in 1990 with eight tree species listed on the Register of Significant Trees in Victoria. * Horsham botanic gardens located by the Wimmera River. * Koroit botanic gardens form part of a large, central recreational area. * Warrnambool's botanic gardens featured wide curving paths, rare trees, a lily pond with ducks, a fernery and a band rotunda. Private Gardens He also undertook private landscape design work which included Nellie Melba's Coombe Cottage at Coldstream; Moritz Michaelis's Linden in Acland Street, Mawallok between Skipton and Beaufort for Philip and Mary Russell in 1909, St Kilda; Werribee Park for the Chirnside brothers; and two gardens near Birregurra, \\"Mooleric\\" – a four-acre (16,000 m²) private garden registered under the Heritage Act as being of state and national significance and \\"Turkeith\\" for Mr. And Mrs. Urquhart Ramsay. The gardens around Parliament House, Melbourne were designed by Clement Hodgkinson and William Guilfoyle and feature the Parliament Gardens, a small triangular park which features the Coles Fountain and provides pleasant views of Parliament House, St Patrick's Cathedral, the Old Synagogue, the Old Baptist Church and the Eastern Hill Fire Station. They became a public reserve in 1934. The Parliament House Gardens, designed by Guilfoyle, have restricted access and are used by parliamentarians and guests, and for official garden parties. The garden contains The Federal Oak which was planted in 1890 by Sir Henry Parkes; a plaque recognising the efforts of Vida Goldstein; and an 'oriental-style' pavilion. Guilfoyle also wrote extensively for the Bankers' Magazine of Australasia, the Victorian Naturalist, and two guide books (1902, 1908) to the Melbourne Botanic Gardens. He also wrote on Australian plants, including Australian Plants Suitable for Gardens, Parks, Timber Reserves etc (1911). Guilfoyle retired from landscape design in 1909, living at Chatsworth in Jolimont Road, Jolimont and died on 25 June 1912. Legacy Eucalyptus guilfoylei was named in honour of Guilfoyle.

Written in 1594 for seven voices, it is structured as three sequences of seven compositions. The Lagrime was to be Lassus’ last composition: he dedicated it to Pope Clement VIII on May 24, 1594, three weeks before his death, and it was published in Munich the next year. Content The Lagrime sets 20 poems by the Italian poet Luigi Tansillo (1510-1568) depicting the stages of grief experienced by St. Peter after his denial of Christ, and his memory of Christ's admonition (). The settings by Lassus are for seven voices, and numerical symbolism plays a part throughout: the seven voices represent the seven sorrows of the Virgin Mary; in addition many of the madrigals are in seven sections. The total number of pieces in the set, 21, represents seven times the number of members of the trinity. In addition, Lassus only sets seven of the eight church modes (modes I through VII), leaving mode VIII entirely out. The madrigals are grouped by successive mode, with madrigals 1 through 4 in mode I, 5 to 8 in mode II, 9 to 12 in modes III and IV, 13 to 15 in mode V, 16 to 18 in mode VI, 19 and 20 in mode VII, and the closing motet based on the tonus peregrinus, entirely outside the Renaissance scheme of the eight church modes. According to David Crook, writing in his 1994 book on the Lassus Magnificat settings: :Mode eight's conspicuous absence and thereby the incomplete representation of the eight- member system in the first twenty madrigals mirror the words of Saint Peter and symbolize all that is imperfect in the world just as surely as the adoption of another tone outside the system for the words of Christ in the Latin envoi serves as a symbol for the other world to come. Crook, p. 143 Musically, the Lagrime are a summation of Lassus's style throughout his career, and he himself indicated in his dedication that they were recently composed. Within the cycle he uses techniques he learned early in his career as a composer of secular madrigals; chromaticism related to his much earlier musica reservata masterpiece Prophetiae Sibyllarum; and the concise, refined, almost austere language he developed late in his career, related to the Palestrina style, in which no note is superfluous. The music sets the text syllabically, with careful regard for diction, and contains pauses where a speaker would naturally stop for breath; and it is entirely through-composed, without repetition or redundancy. The final piece in the set is not a madrigal, but rather a Latin motet: Vide homo, quae pro te patior (Behold, man, how I suffer for you). Here the crucified Christ, speaking in the first person, confronts Peter's betrayal and indeed the sinfulness of all mankind. Canonical status The Lagrime di San Pietro is probably the most famous set of madrigali spirituali ever written. Although sacred madrigals were a small subset of the total output of madrigals, this set by Lassus is often considered by scholars to be one of the highest achievements of Renaissance polyphony, and appeared at the end of an age: within 10 years of its composition, the traditional stile antico had been displaced in many centers by new early Baroque forms such as monody and the sacred concerto for few voices and basso continuo. Of the work, musicologist Alfred Einstein wrote in his 1949 opus The Italian Madrigal: \\"it is ... a spiritual counterpart to the cycles from the great epics of Ariosto and Tasso, an old man's work, comparable in its artistry, its dimensions, its asceticism only to the Musical Offering and the Art of Fugue.\\"Einstein, Vol. 2 p. 496 NotesReferences *\\"Orlande de Lassus\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

History With its strategic position above sea-level, Acerenza has been sacked by a series of invaders. The town, then known as Aceruntia, Acheruntia or Acherontia, was conquered by the Romans in 318 BC. Later, it was taken by the Ostrogoths (it was mentioned as an important fortress during the Gothic Wars) and then the Lombards, who fortified the town. In 788 Charlemagne ordered that its walls be destroyed. In 1041, after a period in which it was fought over by the Principality of Salerno and the Byzantine Empire, it was conquered again by the Norman Robert Guiscard. The town has been the see of an archbishop since at least 499, when a Justus is known. According to legend, the town's first bishop was appointed by St. Peter. From the 16th century, Acerenza was held under the feudal lordship of the Marquess of Galatone, that family being granted the title Duke of Acerenza on 12 April 1593 by Philip II of Spain. Through marriage the duchy of Acerenza was inherited by the family of the Prince Belmonte, in whose line the title has descended to the present day. Main sights *Acerenza Cathedral, begun in 1080 by archbishop Arnando. In Romanesque-Gothic style, it houses a famed marble bust of Julian the Apostate.

The Legislative Council consisted of a mixture of appointed and elected members. Initially the Council consisted of 13 \\"unofficial\\" members (those who were not civil servants serving ex officio in the Council), seven elected and six appointed, to 31 members, 24 of whom were elected. Over time the balance between elected members and appointed members changed. In 1956, the Council consisted of 24 elected and 7 appointed unofficial members. From 1950, the Council served as a unicameral legislature. Background Between 1797 and 1925, Trinidad was directly ruled from Britain as a crown colony with no elected representation. This was unlike the situation in the rest of the British West Indies where an elected Assembly was the norm. While there was a Council of Advice, which was later replaced by a Council of Government and finally by an Executive and Legislative Council, these were purely advisory bodies and had no elected representation. Following an investigative visit to the Caribbean by Major E. F. L.

(known as in Japan) is a puzzle point and click video game developed by Sega and Office I and published by Sega in Japan and Data East USA in North America for the Sega CD, in collaboration with the Theatrical Group WAHAHA Hompo. It was released on April 23, 1993 in Japan, localized to North America in 1994, and later released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on August 8, 2002. The game involves pressing numerous buttons in order to transverse a young boy, called Slap, or his dog, called Stick, through a complex labyrinth. It is one of the few Sega CD games that supports the Sega Mega Mouse. Story During the intro, the game explains that a virus has infected the world's computer systems. Slap and his dog Stick (who has been sucked into his TV) must carry an antidote to the central computer to fix it. To this end, Slap and Stick must traverse a grid of levels, pushing buttons to advance. Gameplay Each level is presented as a new area with a mechanical device, and a set of buttons to press. Each button causes an animation and/or teleports Slap to another room. Sometimes the buttons are booby-trapped and cause the destruction of a variety of monuments. The grid also features a few game overs on the grid, marked by flashing skulls on the map. The buttons themselves have no indication on what they do when pressed. It is possible to backtrack into previous levels, and buttons once pressed are not marked, unless they were booby-trapped. Version differences Two stages were removed for the North American release: Level 2-B, a scene with a cigarette machine, and Level 9-B, featuring a Japanese typewriter. The level 12-D sends the player to the Japanese Mega-CD BIOS screen, but this scene was not changed in the North American version and still showed the Japanese BIOS screen instead of the American one. Reception The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted that Panic! is not actually a game, but opined that it is nonetheless very original and enjoyable for a while, though all but one of them also felt it gets boring fairly quickly. They particularly enjoyed the high quality animations and often \\"sick\\" sense of humor, and gave it a score of 5.75 out of 10. GamePro panned the game, chiefly for its trial-and-error gameplay which requires players to watch many \\"pointless\\" scenes. They added, \\"You might feel differently if there were at least great jokes coming from the switches, but the humor is mostly simplistic cartoons with childish graphics, like basic versions of animations from Monty Python.\\" They gave Panic! a 2.0 out of 5 for graphics, 4.0 for sound, and 1.0 for both control and funfactor, making it one of only 12 games in GamePro history to earn a score of 1.0 or lower. Game Players magazine described the game as being made \\"for people on drugs, by people on drugs.\\" Richard Leadbetter, editor of Mean Machines Sega, awarded the Japanese version of the game a score of 90%. Next Generation reviewed the Sega CD version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Panic wants to defy description and critical analysis.

He was the elder brother of Rudranath Capildeo and uncle of Nobel laureate Sir Vidia \\"V. S.\\" Naipaul and Shiva Naipaul. Capildeo was one of the founding members of the Democratic Labour Party and a member of parliament from 1956 to 1966, becoming known as \\"the Lion of the Legislative Council\\". He served as the Leader of the Opposition in 1956. Capildeo was also an important leader of the Hindu community in Trinidad and played in role in the foundation of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha and the Bhadase Sagan Maraj. In 1989 he was awarded the Chaconia Gold Medal by the Trinidad and Tobago government, honoring his service to the country. His father, Pundit Capildeo Dubey, an immigrant from the village of Mahadeva Dubey, Somra, Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, India, built Anand Bhavan (the \\"Lion House\\") on the Main Road in Chaguanas. The Lion House is arguably the most famous architectural icon representing the Indian heritage of Trinidad and Tobago. Pundit died on a trip to India in 1926, leaving Simbhoonath in the role of family patriarch at the age of 12. His mother, Soogee Capildeo, guided him, but Simbhoonath was an autodidact. His nephew, V.S. Naipaul, wrote about Simbhoonath's love for books in The Mystic Masseur. In his 9-line biographical sketch in the Indian Centenary Review (1845–1945) his hobby is listed as \\"Reading\\". Capildeo studied Hindustani and Sanskrit and became a local expert on Hinduism, and he also explored the philosophers of Western Civilization. He rapidly assumed intellectual leadership of the local Hindu society and in 1928 began creating the modern formal structure of Hindu society in Trinidad and Tobago. He was also the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, preceding Satnarayan Maharaj. Simbhoonath was married to Indradai Capildeo (née Ramoutar) and was the father of one daughter, Sita, born in 1936, and two sons: Devendranath, born in 1938, and Surendranath, born in 1940. Surendranath, also a lawyer, was the only child who followed his father into local politics: he served as a senator of the United National Congress (UNC) party in the early 1990s.

Operational history Kanowna was operated by the Australian United Steam Navigation Company (AUSNC), and it served the Sydney to Fremantle route. A 1914 photograph of Kanowna in Cairns During August and September 1914, Kanowna was requisitioned by the Australian military to transport 1,000 soldiers to German New Guinea as part of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 72 Sailing late from Townsville on 8 August, the ship was forced to anchor off Thursday Island until 16 August, and did not arrive off Port Moresby until 6 September. The expeditionary force sailed the next day for Rabaul, but Kanowna fell behind the rest of the convoy, with the ship's master signalling to that his crew had mutinied: the boiler stokers and firemen had stopped work.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 73 In Arthur Jose's Royal Australian Navy-focused volume of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, he claims that the mutiny was because these men refused to leave Australian waters, but Tom Frame and Kevin Baker state in Mutiny! that this is incorrect; the troopship was on short rations of food and water because of the delays sailing north and only minimal resupply in Port Moresby, but the stokers and firemen were requesting more water to remain hydrated in the hot boilerrooms and to wash off coal grime, and refused to work until this demand was met.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, pp. 72–3Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914–1918, p. 78 The workers were taken into the custody of a party of soldiers, and the force's commander ordered Kanowna to return to Townsville, with soldiers volunteering to keep the ship running. The Australian Commonwealth Naval Board conducted an inquiry into the mutiny, even though as a civilian vessel, Kanowna technically wasn't under their jurisdiction. The state of the supplies was seen as a major contributing factor to the sailors' actions. Kanowna was returned to her owners on 21 September.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914–1918, p. 488 Kanowna in hospital ship livery On 1 June 1915, the vessel was requisitioned again for military service. Kanwona transported soldiers and supplies to Egypt, then made for England, where she was modified for use as a hospital ship. After completion, Kanowna could carry 452 wounded in cots, along with a medical staff of 88 in addition to her regular crew.Jose, The Royal Australian Navy 1914–1918, p. 489 Sailing in September, Kanowna was used to transport Royal Army Medical Corps personnel to locations throughout the Mediterranean, then collected wounded Australian personnel and transported them home. She would make a total of 10 voyages between Australia and England in the next three years, although some runs were made to England with British wounded. In May 1917, the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign forced the ship to sail around Africa instead of through the Mediterranean: the nurses and medical staff were transported overland from Durban to London, and used to supplement hospital personnel until Kanowna arrived in July. In October 1918, after the war's end, the hospital ship was sent to collect 900 British and Commonwealth prisoners-of-war that had been interred in Turkey. Kanowna was returned to the AUSNC on 29 July 1929, and she resumed passenger and cargo service. Fate Twelve nurses aboard Kanowna, to service the hospital ship On 18 February 1929, Kanowna ran into rocks near Cleft Island while on a voyage between Sydney and Melbourne. Passengers were transferred to . Although it was initially thought that Kanowna could be saved by beaching, the ship's boilers had gone out. The crew were taken aboard , and Kanowna sank the following morning. A court of inquiry found the ship's master at fault for the loss, as he did not slow his ship or exercise due caution in the foggy conditions. The wreck of Kanowna is one of Tasmania's shipwrecks. The exact location of the shipwreck was unknown until 2005. On 23 April, four divers found a shipwreck into Bass Strait and submerged in approximately of water, which was believed to be the former merchant ship. A more detailed inspection of the wreck site on 8 May allowed the divers to match the wreck with drawings of Kanowna.

His burial place in Netivot, Israel has become a shrine for prayers and petitioners. Early life and family Grave of the Baba Sali Museum of Jewish Art and History Israel Abuhatzeira was born on Rosh Hashanah 5650 (1889). He was the scion of the distinguished Abu Hasira/Abuhatzeira family of Sephardic Torah scholars and tzadikim who were also known as baalei mofet (miracle workers). He is the grandson of Yaakov Abuhatzeira.http://www.themedialine.org/news/news_detail.asp?NewsID=30952 Israeli Pilgrims to Egyptian Grave Met With Hostility, David E. Miller, December 28, 2010. The patriarch of this family was Shmuel Abuhatzeira. Born in the land of Israel, Shmuel lived in Damascus for a while, where he studied Torah together with Chaim Vital. In Shem Hagedolim, Chaim Joseph David Azulai described Shmuel as \\"an ish Elokim kadosh (a holy man of God). Wise people speak of his might and wonders in saving the Jewish community from many difficulties.\\" Shmuel and his family eventually moved to the city of Tafilalt, Morocco, where Shmuel's son Mas'ud (Moshe in Hebrew) became the rabbi of the city. Mas'ud's son, Yaakov, known as the Avir Yaakov, succeeded his father as rabbi of Tafilalt. Yaakov's eldest son, Mas'ud, became an av beit din in the same city, and it was here that his son, Israel, was born. Abuhatzeira's family lived on a large estate which included a yeshiva where young scholars studied night and day. The beit din (rabbinical court) of his father, Mas'ud, was also located on the premises. His older brother, David, studied by himself in an attic. On the rare times that Mas'ud traveled, he would cover his eyes with his cape to avoid seeing inappropriate sights. As a child, Abuhatzeira was a diligent Torah scholar, studying day and night. At the age of 12, he began to fast during the six weeks of Shovavim. Knowing his parents would not let him continue, he hid his fasting from them, but his brother, David, noticed how weak and pale he was. Though David urged him to stop, Yisrael continued his fasting. After his bar mitzvah, he entered his family's yeshiva, where the students rose at midnight for Tikkun Chatzot and then studied Kabbalistic works until dawn, when they would go to the mikveh, pray the morning service, and eat breakfast. This was followed by in-depth gemara study, the afternoon prayers, and a shiur in Shulchan Aruch. Later years In 1951, Abuhatzeira immigrated to Israel and settled in Lod where he tried to keep conceal himself from the public. However, he was soon discovered and offered the position of Chief Rabbi of Lod, which he declined. He then moved to Baka, Jerusalem where he managed to keep a low profile for a while, without his neighbors even knowing who he was. Again, he was eventually \\"discovered\\" and after the death of Chief Rabbi of Israel, Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel in 1953, he was offered the position, which he also turned down. Several years after his arrival in Israel, the news reached Abuhatzeira that Jewish life in Morocco had spiritually deteriorated greatly, so he returned to his country of birth to lead and inspire the community there. In 1964, he returned to Israel again and soon settled in Netivot, a city in the Negev. He received visitors from all over, asking him for blessings and advice. Funeral and tomb Abuhatzeira died in 1984 (4 Shevat 5744). His funeral was attended by an estimated 100,000 people. His gravesite in Netivot has become a popular pilgrimage site in Israel. On the anniversary of his death, thousands come to visit his tomb and pray.

It is closely related to the Kathiawari breed of the Kathiawar peninsula of Gujarat, with which it shares an unusual inward-curving shape of the ears. It is found in all equine colours, including piebald and skewbald. It is a hardy riding horse; it may exhibit a natural ambling gait. The Rathores, traditional rulers of the Marwar region of western India, were the first to breed the Marwari. Beginning in the 12th century, they espoused strict breeding that promoted purity and hardiness. Used throughout history as a cavalry horse by the people of the Marwar region, the Marwari was noted for its loyalty and bravery in battle. The breed deteriorated in the 1930s, when poor management practices resulted in a reduction of the breeding stock, but today has regained some of its popularity. The Marwari is used for light draught and agricultural work, as well as riding and packing. In 1995, a breed society was formed for the Marwari horse in India. The exportation of Marwari horses was banned for decades, but between 2000 and 2006, a small number of exports were allowed. Since 2008, visas allowing temporary travel of Marwari horses outside India have been available in small numbers. Though they are rare they are becoming more popular outside of India due to their unique looks. This breed is considered as the \\"National breed of India\\" respectively. History alt=Pages of an old manuscript, filled with script. Several paintings of horses are shown, including horses running free and interacting with humans. The origins of the Marwari are obscure. It is thought to descend from the warhorses of the Rajput warriors of the Marwar and Mewar regions of Rajasthan, with subsequent influence of horses of Turkoman type brought to the area by Mughal invaders in the sixteenth century. Unlike the Kathiawari, the Marwari shows little Arab influence; however, legend in India states that an Arabian ship, containing seven Arabian horses of good breeding, was shipwrecked off the shore of the Kachchh District. These horses were then taken to the Marwar district and used as foundation bloodstock for the Marwari. There is also the possibility of some Mongolian influence from the north. The breed probably originated in northwest India on the Afghanistan border, as well as in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and takes its name from the Marwar region (also called the Jodhpur region) of India. The Rathores, rulers of Marwar and successful Rajput cavalry, were the traditional breeders of the Marwari. The Rathores were forced from their Kingdom of Kanauj in 1193, and withdrew into the Great Indian and Thar Deserts. The Marwari was vital to their survival, and during the 12th century they followed strict selective breeding processes, keeping the finest stallions for the use of their subjects. During this time, the horses were considered divine beings, and at times they were only allowed to be ridden by members of the Rajput families and the Kshatriyas warrior caste. When the Moguls captured northern India in the early 16th century they brought Turkoman horses that were probably used to supplement the breeding of the Marwari. Marwaris were renowned during this period for their bravery and courage in battle, as well as their loyalty to their riders. During the late 16th century, the Rajputs of Marwar, under the leadership of Moghul emperor Akbar, formed a cavalry force over 50,000 strong. The Rathores believed that the Marwari horse could only leave a battlefield under one of three conditions – victory, death, or carrying a wounded master to safety. The horses were trained to be extremely responsive in battlefield conditions, and were practised in complex riding maneuvers. Over 300 years later, during the First World War, Marwar lancers under Sir Pratap Singh assisted the British. =1900s to today= In traditional tack The period of the British Raj hastened the Marwari's downfall, as did the eventual independence of India. The British occupiers preferred other breeds, and tried to eliminate the Marwari, along with the Kathiawari. The British instead preferred Thoroughbreds and polo ponies, and reduced the reputation of the Marwari to the point where even the inward-turning ears of the breed were mocked as the \\"mark of a native horse\\". During the 1930s the Marwari deteriorated, with breeding stock diminishing and becoming of poorer quality due to poor breeding practices. Indian independence, along with the obsolescence of warriors on horseback, led to a decreased need for the Marwari and many animals were subsequently killed. In the 1950s many Indian noblemen lost their land and hence much of their ability to take care of animals, resulting in many Marwari horses being sold as pack horses, castrated, or killed. The breed was on the verge of extinction until the intervention of Maharaja Umaid Singhji in the first half of the 20th century saved the Marwari. His work was carried on by his grandson, Maharaja Gaj Singh II. A British horsewoman named Francesca Kelly founded a group called Marwari Bloodlines in 1995, with the goal of promoting and preserving the Marwari horse around the world. In 1999, Kelly and Raghuvendra Singh Dundlod, a descendant of Indian nobility, led a group that founded the Indigenous Horse Society of India (of which the Marwari Horse Society is part), a group that works with the government, breeders, and the public to promote and conserve the breed. Kelly and Dunlod also entered and won endurance races at the Indian national equestrian games, convincing the Equestrian Federation of India to sanction a national show for indigenous horses – the first in the country. The pair worked with other experts from the Indigenous Horse Society to develop the first breed standards. The government of India had originally banned the export of indigenous horse breeds, although not polo ponies or Thoroughbreds, in 1952. This ban was partially lifted in 1999, when a small number of indigenous horses could be exported after receiving a special license. Kelly imported the first Marwari horse into the United States in 2000. Over the next seven years, 21 horses were exported, until, in 2006, licenses stopped being granted over concerns that native breeding populations were being threatened. One of the last Marwaris to be exported was the first to be imported to Europe, in 2006, when a stallion was given to the French Living Museum of the Horse. In 2008, the Indian government began granting licenses for \\"temporary exports\\" of up to one year, to allow horses to be exhibited in other countries. This was in response to breeders and the breed society, who felt they were not being allowed a fair chance to exhibit their animals. In late 2007 plans were announced to create a stud book for the breed, a collaborative venture between the Marwari Horse Society of India and the Indian government. A registration process was initiated in 2009, when it was announced that the Marwari Horse Society had become a government body, the only government- authorized registration society for Marwari horses. The registration process includes an evaluation of the horse against the breed standards, during which unique identification marks and physical dimensions are recorded. After the evaluation, the horse is cold branded with its registration number and photographed. In late 2009 the Indian government announced that the Marwari horse, along with other Indian horse breeds, would be commemorated on a set of stamps issued by that country.  Characteristics  The height at the withers of the Marwari averages for males, and for mares. The coat may be of any colour, and is most often dark or light bay, at times with the metallic sheen often seen in the Akhal-Teke; it may also be grey or chestnut, or occasionally palomino, piebald, or skewbald. White horses cannot be registered. Grey horses are considered auspicious and tend to be the most valuable, with piebald and skewbald horses the second-most favoured. Black horses are considered unlucky, as the colour is a symbol of death and darkness. Horses with a blaze and four white socks are considered lucky. Detail of Marwari ears. The facial profile is straight or slightly Roman, and the ears are medium-sized and curving inward so that the tips meet; also, the Marwari horse can rotate its ears 180º. The neck is arched and carried high, running into pronounced withers, with a deep chest and muscular, broad, and angular shoulders. Marwaris generally have a long back and sloping croup. The legs tend to be slender and the hooves small but well-formed. Members of the breed are hardy and easy keepers, but they can also be of tenacious and unpredictable temperaments. They are quite similar to the Kathiawari horse, another breed from India, having much of the same history and physical features. The main difference between the Marwari and the Kathiawari is their original geographic origin – Marwaris are mainly from the Marwar region while Kathiawaris are from the Kathiawar peninsula. Kathiawaris have inward-slanting ears, a short back, and a straight, slender neck and are more similar to Arabians, but they are pure in breed. Kathiawaris are slightly smaller than Marwaris in general. The Marwari horse often exhibits a natural ambling gait, close to a pace, called the revaal, aphcal, or rehwal. Hair whorls and their placement are important to breeders of Marwaris. Horses with long whorls down the neck are called devman and considered lucky, while horses with whorls below their eyes are called anusudhal and are unpopular with buyers. Whorls on the fetlocks are thought to bring victory. The horses are expected to have correct proportions, based on the width of a finger, said to be the equal of five grains of barley. For example, the length of the face should be between 28 and 40 fingers, and the length from the poll to the dock should be four times the length of the face. Genetic studies As a direct result of indiscriminate breeding practices, as of 2001 only a few thousand purebred Marwari horses existed. Research studies have been conducted to examine the genetics of the Marwari horse and its relationship to other Indian and non-Indian horse breeds. Six different breeds have been identified in India: the Marwari, Kathiawari, Spiti pony, Bhutia pony, Manipuri Pony, and Zanskari. These six are distinct from each other in terms of unique performance traits and different agroclimactic conditions in the various areas of India where they originated. A 2005 study was conducted to identify past genetic bottlenecks in the Marwari horse. The study found that, in the DNA of the horses tested, there was no evidence of a genetic bottleneck in the breed's history. However, since the population has decreased rapidly in past decades, bottlenecks may have occurred that were not identified in the study. In 2007, a study was conducted to assess genetic variation among all Indian horse breeds except the Kathiawari. Based on analysis of microsatellite DNA, the Marwari was found to be the most genetically distinct breed of the five studied, and was most distant from the Manipuri; none of the breeds were found to have close genetic ties to the Thoroughbred. The Marwari was distinguishable from the other breeds in terms of both physical characteristics (mainly height) and environmental adaptability. The physical differences were attributed to differing ancestries: the Marwari horse are closely associated with the Arabian horse, while the four other breeds are supposedly descended from the Tibetan pony. A Marwari horse alt=A dark brown horse ridden by a man in a red jacket and white pants, in mid-air over a jump Uses The Marwari horse is a riding horse; it may also be used for shows, horse safaris, sport, ceremonial & religious purposes, and during earlier days in war. Marwari horses are often crossed with Thoroughbreds to produce a larger horse with more versatility. Despite the fact that the breed is indigenous to the country, cavalry units of the Indian military make little use of the horses, although they are popular in the Jodhpur and Jaipur areas of Rajasthan, India. They are particularly suited to dressage, in part due to a natural tendency to perform. Marwari horses are also used to play polo, sometimes playing against Thoroughbreds. Within the Marwari horse breed was a strain known as the Natchni, believed by local people to be \\"born to dance\\". Decorated in silver, jewels, and bells, these horses were trained to perform complex prancing and leaping movements at many ceremonies, including weddings. Although the Natchni strain is extinct today, horses trained in those skills are still in demand in rural India. ReferencesFurther reading *.

It is a part of the Cambridge Public School District. In 1977, two separate schools, the Rindge Technical School and Cambridge High and Latin School, merged to form the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. The newly built high school at the time increased its capacity to more than 2,000 students from all four grades. The school is divided into 'Learning Communities.' The Learning Communities are called C, R, L, and S. Until June 2000, the subdivisions were called Houses: Pilot, Fundamental, House A, Academy, Leadership, and the Rindge School of Technical Arts or RSTA. In 1990, RSTA became a \\"house\\" within the main CRLS school. The \\"Houses\\" then temporarily became \\"Schools\\" (called schools 1/2/3/4/5). In 2004 the schools transitioned to become \\"Learning Communities\\" C (formerly school 1), R(formerly school 2), L(formerly school 3), and S(formerly school 5). The High School Extension Program, at the site of the old Longfellow School, just down Broadway, offers a nontraditional approach to the high school learning process, handling only 60–100 students at a time. In 2009 and 2010, the building became a temporary freshman academy to accommodate renovations. CRLS is noted for its diversity. Cambridge Rindge and Latin is one of the few urban high schools to place A students and D students in the same classrooms. Achievement-blind classes are intended to break down barriers, but it remains to be seen if the program will serve as a national model or a cautionary tale. Beginning in 2003, the City of Cambridge mobilized an ambitious plan to renovate the high school. The project was claimed to be \\"the first major renovation and refurbishing of the 35-year-old [sic] high school building.\\" The project continued to be pushed back, due to state funding issues and other obstructions along the way. In 2006, the state announced a return in funding, and by the Spring 2007 the School Committee started looking at wider ranging renovations for the building. The renovations were undertaken in 2009-2011. History CRLS is actually several separate schools combined into a greater whole. In 1642, the year Harvard College's first class of nine young men graduated, the General Court made it the duty of Cambridge to require that parents and masters properly educate their children or be fined if they neglected to do so. (Girls, however, did not usually attend public schools until 1789, when Boston voted that \\"children of both sexes\\" should be taught in the reading and writing schools of their newly reorganized system.) In 1648, Cambridge set up a public grammar school, Master Elijah Corlett's \\"lattin schoole,\\" making Cambridge the fifth town (after Boston, Charlestown, Dorchester, and Salem) in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to do so. Corlett's schoolhouse came into the possession of Old Cambridge in 1660, and over the next century was succeeded by several new buildings. The public school that evolved from Cortlett's original was a \\"grammar school\\" in a double sense: an English grammar school for Old Cambridge and a Latin grammar school (teaching the rudiments of Latin and Greek) for all Cambridge.Arthur Gilman, ed. The Cambridge of 1896: a picture of the city and its industries fifty years after its incorporation. The Riverside Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1896. pages 187–197. Google Books The school generally aimed to prepare students for admission to college: :“And by the side of the colledge a faire GRAMMAR Schoole, for the training up of young Schollars, and fitting of them for ACADEMICALL LEARNING, that still as they are judged ripe, they may be received into the colledge of this Schoole. Master CORLETT is the Mr., who hath very well approved himselfe for his abilities, dexterity and painfulness in teaching and education of the youth under him.”\\"History\\", Cambridge Public School District (archived 2004) By 1832, public schools in Cambridge were open to girls as well as boys. In 1838, Cambridgeport organized a public high school to serve all of Cambridge at the corner of Broadway and Windsor Streets. However, since the location was not easily accessible to either Old Cambridge or East Cambridge, most of the new high schools' students were drawn from Cambridgeport. In 1843, Old Cambridge set up the Female High School, and East Cambridge completed its Otis schoolhouse. Not until 1848 did plans to merge the high schools of the three competitive wards overcome sectional differences. This marked the origin of the Cambridge High School, which began in a new building erected at the corner of Amory and Summer streets and was immediately flooded with over 135 applicants. The Cambridge High School was divided in 1886: its classical department became the Cambridge Latin School and its remaining departments the Cambridge English High School. The English High School was located at the corner of Broadway and Fayette Streets, while the Latin School was transferred to the Lee Street church, which had been renovated to receive it. At the time of the separation, the high school contained 515 pupils, and 16 teachers. Six teachers and 165 pupils went to the Latin school. In September 1888, the Cambridge Manual Training School for Boys (to become Rindge Tech), founded and maintained by Frederick Hastings Rindge, was opened to the boys of the English High School. In 1892, the English High School moved into a commodious new building on Broadway; Rindge had presented the land to Cambridge at a cost of $230,000. The EHS's old building at Broadway and Fayette was remodeled, and the Latin School moved in. By 1896, the Latin School had grown so quickly that plans were underway for another new building (cost approx. $250,000) that would stand on land adjacent to the English High School building and the Public Library. In 1977, Cambridge High & Latin and the Rindge School of Technical Arts and were merged into Cambridge Rindge and Latin, or CRLS. The old Cambridge High & Latin building was demolished in 1980, but the old granite lintel and doorway frameThe old Latin School arch Retrieved July 17, 2010 have been put in place at the corner of Ellery Street and Broadway as a commemorative archway, leading into the grassy fields of Joan Lorentz Park. In 2001 there was an attempt to restructure the Cambridge Rindge & Latin school under headmaster Paula Evans, which had found controversy. She resigned shortly afterwards. After her resignation she began efforts to create a charter school, which became the Community Charter School of Cambridge (CCSC). Colleen Walsh of the Boston Globe said that Evans's charter school efforts \\"touched off a firestorm\\" and that \\"many people\\" were upset at her because they perceived that she had abandoned Cambridge Rindge & Latin.Walsh, Colleen. \\"A NEW SCHOOL CAMPAIGNS FOR CREDIBILITY ; EDUCATOR UPBEAT DESPITE THE CRITICS.\\" Boston Globe. August 14, 2005. City Weekly p. 8. Retrieved on June 3, 2013. =Controversy= During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the school was subject to multiple accusations of inherent racism in its infrastructure, which led to the disbanding of the original houses, as well as the changing of the original school mascot from a bust of a Native American to a falcon and their name from Warriors to Falcons after concerns about the racist history of the mascot. Students entered their ideas and then voted for the new mascot in a school wide contest. The graduating class of '90 went from wearing brown and gold and Native American warrior and being called The Mighty Warriors to wearing black and silver and a falcon and being called Falcons. The Register Forum The school's newspaper, Register Forum, is the oldest continually published public high school newspaper in the country. The newspaper was first founded in 1891 as the C.M.T.S Register, the name was further changed to the Rindge Register, and in 1977, when the two public high schools in the city merged, their papers merged as well. The Cambridge Latin Forum merged with the Rindge Register to become The Register Forum. Since then, the paper has won numerous awards in high school journalism. The Register Forum now publishes 10 editions per year at the end of each month, September to June. Those editions range from 8 to 24 pages, and focus on events around the school. The paper is printed at The Harvard Crimson press. Athletics Athletics have always played a major part in the school's extracurricular activity structure, and most of the school's 30 teams have received some form of statewide recognition of excellence. The 11 fall and winter sports take place between September and Thanksgiving (the day of the football team's final game), and between the first Monday following Thanksgiving and February/March. The ten spring sports start on the third Monday in March, and finish in late May. Arts CRLS has extensive arts programs, with an emphasis on visual and performing arts. The school has programs in photography, graphic design, fine arts, pottery, a modern dance company, a jazz band and an orchestra. The school's drama department has won numerous awards and frequently competes in the yearly statewide drama festival, having reached the finals level four times in the past five years. The technical theater department is frequently singled out for excellence.

In contrast to the cytoskeleton, however, the nuclear matrix has been proposed to be a dynamic structure. Along with the nuclear lamina, it aids in organizing the genetic information within the cell. The exact function of this matrix is still disputed, and its very existence has been called into question. Evidence for such a structure was recognised as long ago as 1948 (Zbarskii and Debov), and consequently many proteins associated with the matrix have been discovered. The presence of intra-cellular proteins is common ground, and it is agreed that proteins such as the Scaffold, or Matrix Associated Proteins (SAR or MAR) have some role in the organisation of chromatins. There is evidence that the nuclear matrix is involved in regulation of gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. Justification of the nuclear matrix hypothesis For a long time the question whether a polymer meshwork, a “nuclear matrix” or “nuclear-scaffold” or \\"NuMat\\" is an essential component of the in vivo nuclear architecture has remained a matter of debate. While there are arguments that the relative position of chromosome territories (CTs), the equivalent of condensed metaphase chromosomes at interphase, may be maintained due to steric hindrance or electrostatic repulsion forces between the apparently highly structured CT surfaces, this concept has to be reconciled with observations according to which cells treated with the classical matrix-extraction procedures maintain defined territories up to the point where a minor subset of acidic nuclear matrix proteins is released – very likely those proteins that governed their association with the nuclear skeleton. The nuclear matrix proteome consists of structural proteins, chaperones, DNA/RNA-binding proteins, chromatin remodeling and transcription factors. The complexity of NuMat is an indicator of its diverse structural and functional significance. S/MARs (scaffold/matrix attachment elements), the DNA regions that are thought to attach genomic DNA to the nuclear skeleton, show an ever increasing spectrum of established biological activities. All these activities are in agreement with (or most easily explained by) the nuclear matrix hypothesis. This is one justification for maintaining this concept before equally plausible alternative models emerge. S/MARs find increasing use for the rational design of vectors with widespread use in gene therapy and biotechnology. Nowadays S/MAR functions can be modulated, improved and custom- tailored to the specific needs of novel vector systems. Nuclear matrix and cancer The nuclear matrix composition on human cells has been proven to be cell type and tumor specific. It has been clearly demonstrated that the nuclear matrix composition in a tumor is different from its normal counterparts. This fact could be useful to characterize cancer markers and to predict the disease even earlier. These markers have been found in urine and blood and could potentially be used in early detection and prognosis of human cancers.

It was commonly known as \\"pedopartij\\" (\\"pedo party\\") in the media, due to its advocacy for legalization of child pornography and the lowering of the age of consent to age 12. PNVD was founded on 31 May 2006 by three self-described pedophiles. Its motto is \\"sapere aude\\" (\\"Have courage to use your own reason\\"). PNVD has not participated in any election. In 2006, it did not receive the 30 signatures from each of the 19 Dutch electoral regions it would need to get on the ballot for the 2006 elections. On March 14, 2010, the party was dissolved. The party was restarted in January 2020, with its website proclaiming \\"the PNVD is returning in early 2020\\". Its leader Marthijn Uittenbogaard has announced he will not be a part of the party due to a police raid at his home. Platform According to their official statement, the PNVD's platform aimed to maximize diversity and liberty. They proposed allowing individuals, from the age of 12, to vote, have sex, gamble, choose their place of residence, and use soft drugs. Hard drugs would be legal at 16, as that would be the new age of majority. They also intended to eliminate marriage in the law, permit public nudity anywhere in the country, make railway travel free, and institute a comprehensive animal rights platform. They were opposed to immigration and religious elementary schools. =Sexuality= The PNVD sought to have the legal age of consent lowered to 12, and, in the long run, completely eliminated (except in dependent or intrafamilial relationships). They reason that only \\"coerced\\" or \\"dangerous\\" sexual activity should be punished. They also aimed to equalize the legal age where one can perform in pornography with the legal age of consent. Prostitution would be legal at the age of 16. The PNVD wanted to legalise private use of child pornography (calling outlawing thereof \\"censorship\\" in the platform) and allow non-violent pornography to be screened on daytime television. Their platform also included legalization of humans engaging in sex with animals. Treasurer Van den Berg claimed that, \\"Rearing is also about introducing children to sex\\". Because of their controversial viewpoints on children and sexuality, they were often called the \\"paedo-party\\" by the people and in the media. Also, the party's platform called for separate imprisonment facilities for sex offenders, arguing that the country would otherwise have indirect torture laws. =Animal rights= The PNVD ultimately aimed to establish a universal treaty guaranteeing all animals basic rights. In addition, the party planned to heavily restrict animal testing and completely prohibit the consumption of meat and fish: they viewed the killing of animals, no matter what purpose it serves, as murder. Industries currently depending on the sale of animal meat would receive provisional financial support from the government. Hunting and fishing for sport would also be banned. The party also supported laws criminalizing the \\"sexual maltreatment\\" of animals. Controversy Multiple positions taken by the PNVD were controversial, especially those concerning children. In a May 2006 opinion poll, 82% of respondents wanted the Dutch government to stop the party from competing in the elections. The anti-pedophile foundation \\"Soelaas\\" petitioned the courts to ban the party, but the judges ruled in the PNVD's favour. \\"The freedom of expression, the freedom of assembly and the freedom of association … should be seen as the foundations of the democratic rule of law and the PNVD is also entitled to these freedoms,\\" the court said in a statement. The founders, executive committee, and only public members (Marthijn Uittenbogaard, Ad van den Berg and Norbert de Jonge) The party's ties to paedophile activism have also drawn much attention: Marthijn Uittenbogaard (who also starred in the controversial documentary Are All Men Pedophiles?) was earlier the treasurer of Vereniging MARTIJN, an organization which advocates romantic and sexual relationships between adults and children, and all of its founders have identified as pedophiles. The treasurer, Ad van den Berg (then 43), was convicted in 1987 for molesting an 11-year-old boy. He was fined and given a suspended prison sentence.Court refuses to ban Dutch pedophile party AP article The Dutch television show \\"Netwerk\\" monitored Van den Berg for three months. They discovered that he still has an under-age boyfriend. In June 2006, Norbert de Jonge was expelled from his special education course at the Radboud University Nijmegen, owing to his involvement with the party and identification as a pedophile.Nijmeegse universiteit verwijdert pedofiele student, NU.nl, 16 juni 2006 The Dutch Zoo Federation and which used the initials 'NVD' forced the party to switch to using the initials 'PNVD' to protect their reputation.

History St. Paul's College on the University of Manitoba campus is the major Catholic higher education institution in Manitoba. In 1926 the Oblate Fathers, with a staff of six and a student body of one hundred, opened St. Paul's College as the first English Catholic High School for boys in the Province of Manitoba. Fr. Alphonse Simon, OMI was the first Rector. There was a rapid increase in students and the building on Selkirk Avenue soon proved inadequate. In 1931 Archbishop Sinnott, who had worked tirelessly to get the College started from as early as 1916, purchased the old Manitoba College (which had opened in 1882) at the corner of Ellice and Vaughan Streets in downtown Winnipeg and the College moved to this new location. The direction of the College passed into the hands of the diocesan clergy and Fr. C. B. Collins was appointed Rector. In the same year, the College became affiliated with the University of Manitoba. The University of Manitoba, as founded in 1877, was a federation of three denominational colleges: St. Boniface (Catholic), St. John's (Anglican), and Manitoba (Presbyterian). In 1888 Wesley College (Methodist) became affiliated. On October 27, 1931, at the time of its affiliation, St. Paul's had a staff of 15 (eight priests and seven laymen), and a total of twelve students in the University program. The University of Manitoba Yearbook for 1932, The Brown and Gold, displays the photographs of the first two graduates of the College. At the request of the Archbishop, the Jesuit Fathers undertook direction of the College in 1933. Fr. John Holland, S.J., was appointed Rector, and Fr. Erle Bartlett, S.J. was appointed Dean of Studies. Their photographs and those of their successors line the corridor of the administrative wing of the College. In 1936, St. Mary's College for Women became the women's division of St. Paul's, until the College opened on the Fort Garry campus in 1957 when it became co-educational and St. Mary's eventually withdrew from university work. The facilities available to the College on Ellice Avenue were never fully adequate. Largely through the generosity of Mrs. Margaret Shea, a new unit, Paul Shea Hall, had been erected, providing a separate High School building in 1932. In 1939, six more classrooms were added and paid for through the Archdiocese and generous friends of the College. By the mid-1940s, students were being turned away because of the lack of space. A building fund drive at that time was not particularly successful and attention was turned again to relocating on the University of Manitoba campus with whom ongoing negotiations about relocation had been taking place. Following a pressing invitation from the University in 1954, there was much discussion and finally a decision was made in 1956 to accept the University's offer. In 1957 a 99-year lease for land on the campus was signed and a cornerstone was laid and blessed by Archbishop Pocock. At that ceremony, the Honourable Mr. Miller, Minister of Education, speaking on behalf of the government, congratulated the College for undertaking the move and added to the Archbishop's blessing \\"if you want governmental blessing, you have it.\\" The Canada council contributed $100,000 towards the construction costs. The architect was Mr. Peter Thornton, the contractors were Wallace and Aikens. In the fall of 1958, the basic buildings and administrative offices containing classrooms, library, cafeteria, faculty offices, and the chapel were ready for the first students. About 200 registered that year. In 1962 the Science Wing was added, containing well- furnished laboratories, further class rooms, and faculty offices. The student cafeteria was extended in 1964 and the Residence of the Jesuit Fathers was added. 1972 saw the construction of our beautiful library, a theatre to seat 200, and the addition of further classroom and faculty office space. A larger library and a student residence were part of the original plan, but were never constructed. Presently the College is under the direction of the St. Paul's Corporation and an 18-person Board of Governors. The Archbishop of Winnipeg is the College Chancellor and the College continues to value its commitment as a Catholic College in the Jesuit tradition. The new millennium saw the construction of the Arthur V. Mauro Centre for Peace and Justice - an addition that provides graduate and undergraduate studies in peace-building and conflict-resolution. These programs that will help the community close to home and around the globe. Scholarships and bursaries The Government of Canada sponsors an Aboriginal Bursaries Search Tool that lists over 680 scholarships, bursaries, and other incentives offered by governments, universities, and industry to support Aboriginal post-secondary participation. St. Paul's College scholarships for Aboriginal, First Nations and Métis students include: Sundance Aboriginal Student Award. Arthur V. Mauro Institute The Arthur V. Mauro Institute (formerly the Arthur V. Mauro Centre) at St. Paul's College, University of Manitoba, is dedicated to the advancement of human rights, conflict resolution, global citizenship, peace, and social justice through research, education, and outreach. The Mauro Institute's initial emphases has been the cultural, religious, and philosophical dimensions of peace; social, economic, and environmental justice; peace education; human rights; and the role of international organizations and standards in the quest for peace and justice. The Institute is also interested in the role of the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in pointing ways for people to live in peace and harmony in a post-modern world. The Joint M.A. Program in Peace and Conflict Studies (governed jointly by the University of Manitoba and the University of Winnipeg) is housed at the Mauro Centre (U of M) and the Global College (U of W). The Institute is home to the University of Manitoba's Ph.D. Program in Peace and Conflict Studies, which seeks to prepare leaders in a multiplicity of contexts who make a difference locally, nationally, and globally. Storytelling for Peace and Renewing Community (SPARC) is an initiative of the Institute that encompasses the Winnipeg International Storytelling Festival: Storytelling on the Path to Peace; the Youth Forum on Human Rights, Peace, and Social Justice; a 6-credit master's-level Summer Institute on Storytelling for Peace and Human Rights; and the Mauro Centre Storytelling Working Group. Near Eastern and Biblical Archaeology Laboratory The Near Eastern and Biblical Archaeology Laboratory (NEBAL) was established in 2010 by St. Paul’s College at the University of Manitoba. The goal is to have a single integrated location for the study of the ancient cultures of the Near East and eastern Mediterranean. It provides a focus for seminars and lectures related to Near Eastern and Biblical Studies at the University of Manitoba. All related archaeological remains scattered throughout the university are being gathered in this location for analysis and curation. NEBAL also provides a single integrated research and administrative facility for faculty and students. Fr. Harold Drake Library The Fr. Harold Drake Library at St. Paul's College focuses on supporting the teaching and research needs of staff and students at St. Paul's College including the University One programme, the Jesuit Centre for Catholic Studies and the Arthur V.

The Library’s attractive and comfortable study facilities offer a supportive work environment. The Library’s collections and services are open to all University of Manitoba Libraries patrons. Catholic Studies Program The historical relationships and ongoing encounters that the members of the Roman Catholic Church have had with disciplines such as history, the arts and sciences, as well as human thought comprise the framework around which the Catholic Studies program is formed. The Catholic Studies program at St. Paul's College was designed as an interdisciplinary unit that fosters an intellectual and academic approach to Catholicism. It seeks to explore the Catholic tradition in ways that do justice to its full contributions and challenges as a historical and contemporary phenomenon. In order to provide crucial perspectives on the Catholic culture, the program itself includes the findings of many academic disciplines such as Religion, History, Fine Arts, and Philosophy. The Catholic Studies Program appeals to students from a wide variety of intellectual and religious backgrounds. Its goal is to study, explore, and engage Catholicism in all its social, political, and religious complexities. The program is aimed at students who wish to pursue Catholic Studies as a minor as well as for those students who only want to take one or two courses that would expand and deepen their understanding of Catholicism. St. Paul's College Students' Association The St. Paul's College Students' Association (SPCSA) consists of students pursuing any program of study at U of M, who are registered members of the college. SPCSA members are elected annually by students. Its purpose is to organize and promote events and special initiatives, and represent students' interests (academic, spiritual, and social). SPCSA relies on the active involvement and interest of the students. Events are planned throughout the year such as an Welcome Back BBQ, Sibling Rivalry BBQ with St. John's College, Back to School Bash,Valentine's Day Bash, St. Patrick's Day Bash, and closing ceremonies. All students, faculty and staff at U of M are welcome to attend social events at St. Paul's College. See also * St. Paul's web site * Bumsted, Dr. John M (Jack).

It is associated with the Kathi people of that area. It was originally bred as a desert war horse for use over long distances, in rough terrain, on minimal rations. It is closely related to the Marwari horses of Rajasthan; both breeds have been influenced by imported Arab horses. It is found in all colours except for black, and is most commonly chestnut. Its numbers diminished after Indian independence, and today there are few Kathiawaris left. In the past it was used as a war horse and cavalry mount. Today it is used for riding, in harness and for sports; it may be used as a police horse and for the sport of tent-pegging. A breed register is kept by the Kathiawari Horse Breeders' Association, which also organises annual shows.  Characteristics  The average height at the withers is . Height should not be more than about ; taller horses may seem coarse. Chestnut is the most common colour, followed by bay, grey and dun. Dun horses may have primitive markings, a dorsal stripe and zebra stripes on the legs. The black color does not appear in the breed. Skewbald patterns can occur. The Kathiawari has a concave facial profile, with a broad forehead and short muzzle. The neck and body are proportional and relatively short, while both the head and tail are carried high. Although well-proportioned, many Western breeders consider them to be lacking in bone in the legs. However, soundness is an inherent characteristic of the breed. One of the breed's most distinctive features is its ears, which curve inward to touch and sometimes overlap at the tips. The Kathiawari has the most extremely curved ears of any breed of horse. At some points in the breed's history, breeders focused on the preservation of these curving ears, to the detriment of some other, more important, physical characteristics. Like many desert breeds, the Kathiawari can subsist on minimal rations and water and is more resistant to the heat than breeds developed in colder climates. As well as the usual gaits, the Kathiawari also performs a swift, lateral pace, called the revaal. It is a high-spirited, intelligent and affectionate horse. The Kathiawari is closely related to the Marwari breed from the Marwar region of Rajasthan, which borders with northern Gujarat. Genetic diversity analysis groups the two breeds, while the other four Indian horse breeds – the Bhutia, the Manipuri, the Spiti and the Zaniskari – form a distinct and separate group. The Kathiawari and the Marwari are also phenotypically similar; in particular, they have the same unusual in-curved ears. The Kathiawari is not as tall as the Marwari, and has a smaller thoracic circumference; it is most commonly chestnut, while the Marwari is usually black. Kathiawaris tend to have slight facial differences from the Marwari. The Kathiawari also resembles the Arab horse, which contributed significantly during the development of the breed.  History  The origins of the Kathiawari are unknown. There were indigenous horses on the western coast of India before the arrival in the early sixteenth century of the Turco-Mongol invaders who later established the Mughal Empire. Beginning during the Mughal reign, and continuing during the British Raj, Arab horses were imported to India and crossed with native stock, creating the ancestors of the modern Kathiawari breed. The Kathiawari may have also been influenced by the Mongolian horse. Traditionally, noble households specialised in their own strain of horses, naming their lines of horses after a foundation mare; 28 of these lines still exist. These noble houses selectively bred horses that could withstand extreme temperatures and minimal rations, carry a man with weapons and armour for long periods in rough terrain, and still be swift and nimble. They bred for wiry, sleek horses that were ideal for war, and Kathiawaris were noted for their loyalty and bravery in battle, often defending their riders even when wounded themselves. This breeding was maintained until the Independence of India. Although still mainly bred in the Kathiawar peninsula, it is also found in the Maharashtra and Rajasthan states. The Kathiawari Horse Breeders' Association maintains a register. The Gujarat government maintains stud farms in eleven different locations; one in Junagadh holds both mares and stallions and is tasked with preserving the breed, while the other ten hold Kathiawari stallions that are used for improving the local stock of other or mixed breeds. In 2007, only about 50 Kathiawaris were held by private breeders.Today, the Panchaal region is renowned for its Kathiawari horses, often producing the most beautiful horses of the breed. In 2007 the conservation status of the Kathiawari was listed as \\"not at risk\\" by the FAO. No breed numbers have been reported to DAD-IS since 1997, when there were about 7500. A breed standard was drawn up in 2008.  Use  In the past, the Kathiawari was considered a good cavalry mount. It was used by Maratha cavalry, and later – until the end of the First World War – by the Indian Army. In modern times it is used as a riding horse or as a harness horse. Some are used by Indian police forces, sometimes for tent-pegging, to which the Kathiawari is well suited. In 1995, annual breed shows were hosted by the breed association.

In 1970, a church committee headed by Naomi W. Randall recommended that the shield be incorporated into official church material. Since then, both the phrase and symbol have been used in religious educational materials for LDS youth of Primary age.. The symbol is also used in LDS culture by members of all ages, both as a reminder of the motto, as well as an indicator of religious affiliation.

History Commuter Cars was founded in Spokane, Washington by Rick Woodbury and his son Bryan Woodbury in 1998. Woodbury says his father came up with the original idea some time in the early 1980s. Woodbury learned that 106 million U.S. commuters were driving to work alone. He decided to produce a single occupant fast electric car. Starting in the 1980s, Woodbury started researching hydrogen power leading to fuel cells. The weight of fuel cells led to the idea of a stable, narrow vehicle with a low center of gravity. While waiting for fuel cell technology to catch up, he eventually settled on a design for the car to have individual small electric motors for each wheel. In his spare time, he worked on building his first car. In 1998, he sold his yacht to fund the company. He eventually settled on a plan to use parts that were already produced, instead of producing every part for the Commuter Cars. Commuter Cars uses various assemblies manufactured for other, more common cars. Among those assemblies is a safety cage made to NASCAR specifications. Production of the first of their line of ultra-narrow electric sports cars began with the Tango T600. The company designed a small ( 69 in. long and 29 in. wide) electric cars. Commuter Cars said production of the first version, at a rate of about 100 cars per year, was set to begin in late 2005. Actor George Clooney took delivery of the first Tango kit on August 9, 2005, which was a major milestone for the company. Clooney appeared in the press with the car, explaining and promoting it. Difficulties with their UK manufacturer forced Commuter Cars to take over manufacturing themselves; for this reason the second vehicle did not ship until February 11, 2008, and was completely assembled in Spokane, Washington. The second car eventually found its way into the second-floor office of Google CEO Eric Schmidt as part of an April Fools' Day joke. By 2008 Commuter Cars had only produced 10 cars which sold for an average of $121,000 each. The first production car was sold to actor George Clooney who took delivery on August 9, 2005. The company generated a significant amount of media interest with the sale to Clooney. However, that initial media attention did not lead to a production deal. In 2010, the company entered the Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize in the \\"Alternative\\" category. The vehicle entered was a Tango T600 owned by Google founder Sergey Brin, borrowed back for the competition. After passing many of the performance tests with ease, the car failed to complete the 100 mile durability run (one of the complicated set of requirements for the prize) and was eliminated from the competition. The company did not get a production deal with a manufacturer, and by 2014, fewer than 20 cars had been built in the United States. Throughout the company's history, Commuter Cars has had limited financial resources. When the company did generate a small profit, they reinvested the money in research and production capacity for their future vehicles. When the company had sufficient funding during 2007, it employed eight workers and was able to manufacture one car each month. By 2018 Car and Driver magazine gave the company a chance of survival. Overview The Tango is thinner than some motorcycles and may be small enough to legally ride side- by-side with other small vehicles in traffic lanes in some jurisdictions. Capable of seating two passengers in a tandem seating arrangement, it only takes up one-quarter of a standard parking space and is able to park sideways in many cases. One prototype vehicle has been produced by the company and was shipped to Prodrive in the United Kingdom in January 2005, where the design was refined for production models. Commuter Cars says the Tango's heavy battery pack and low ground-clearance combine to give it a center-of-mass from the ground, allowing for stable handling. About two-thirds of the curb weight in the prototype is taken up by the batteries, twin motors, and controller, mounted low in the frame. Commuter Cars says production models are expected to weigh less, ranging from . Propulsion is provided by two electric motors. To extend its range, an optional generator cart can be attached to the Tango. Recharge Commuter Cars notes that a dryer outlet will give most of the charge in an hour, or a full charge in less than 3 hours. With a 110-volt outlet, the batteries can fully charge overnight. With a 200-amp off-board charger, the Tango can be charged to 80% in about 10 minutes.

He is a founding member of the band Cake. He is the vocalist and primary lyricist for the band, in addition to playing rhythm acoustic guitar, vibraslap, and piano. He also programs drums and does mixing work while he and the rest of the band have produced all of their albums. Biography Prior to Cake, McCrea spent most of the 1980s playing in various bands or performing solo. His mid-1980s band John McCrea and the Roughousers recorded the songs \\"Love You Madly\\" and \\"Shadow Stabbing,\\" which were later re-recorded by Cake (both featured on 2001's Comfort Eagle). This band included Michael Urbano (drums), Pete Costello (bass), and Robert Kuhlmann (guitar). In the late 1980s, McCrea moved to Los Angeles and began playing acoustically in local coffee shops. His first solo release was a double-sided single on vinyl only called Rancho Seco. One side was electric and the other acoustic. The single was a protest song against the now-decommissioned nuclear power plant Rancho Seco built southeast of Sacramento. Vocal style McCrea's voice has a distinctive \\"rough-around- the-edges\\" quality, which is especially evident when he sings in the lower part of his vocal range. He is also known for half-singing, half-speaking lyrics in many of his songs, sometimes in a kind of energetic monotone, such as the hits \\"The Distance\\" and \\"Never There.\\" McCrea also commonly sings with off-beat rhythms and emphasizes the consonants in words instead of the vowels. The single \\"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps,\\" is a good example of this. Personal life McCrea is a vocal activist for various causes, notably global warming and world poverty. He frequently uses the band's website and concerts as a platform to increase awareness about these and other issues. He is a member of the board of directors of HeadCount, a non-profit organization that uses music to promote voter registration and participation. He is also the founder of the Content Creators Coalition, a group of musicians and creatives that advocates for the rights of artists. Collaborations He has collaborated with Ben Folds, singing on the track \\"Fred Jones, Part 2\\" from 2001's Rockin' the Suburbs and performing the song live with Folds and on Folds' 2002 album Ben Folds Live.

Publication history Metron first appeared in New Gods #1 (February–March 1971) and was created by Jack Kirby for his Fourth World series in DC Comics. Metron was based on actor Leonard Nimoy's portrayal of the Star Trek character Spock and designed as a character who \\"would frequently change sides (between New Genesis and Apokolips)\\".Ro, Ronin. Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution (Bloomsbury, 2004) Fictional character biography Although he possesses the powers of a god, Metron is typically depicted as a passive observer in the DC Universe rather than an active participant. He wanders in search of greater knowledge beyond his own, riding on his Mobius Chair, which can traverse time and space instantaneously. Metron is of neither New Genesis nor Apokolips, and usually avoids the struggle between the two worlds almost entirely. As he states in New Gods #7, \\"The Pact\\": \\"I have no link with the Old Gods -- or New!! I am something different! Something that was unforeseen!! -- On New Genesis -- or here!!\\" Metron invented the \\"Boom Tube\\" technology used by the New Gods to teleport vast distances. In 1989's Legend mini-series, Metron confides in Darkseid about the Anti-Life Equation. Apparently, Metron holds the key to the Anti-Life Equation. However, he is a seeker of knowledge and so will tell no one of his knowledge. In the 1982 DC/Marvel crossover, The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans, Metron tells Darkseid that Dark Phoenix is a part of the Anti-Life Equation. In the 2007 \\"Death of the New Gods\\" miniseries leading into Final Crisis, the Source explains the origin of the Anti-Life Equation to Metron. Metron helped contact most of Earth's superheroes in order to gather them during the Zero Hour crisis. During Extant's return, he fought alongside the Justice Society of America in defeating Extant after he gained control of the omnipotent Worlogog. In Kurt Busiek's JLA/Avengers miniseries, Metron observes the events in that story, and gives Iron Man a Mother Box to balance the power given to the Justice League by Grandmaster. His main role during the miniseries is to observe and investigate Krona's actions, refusing to deviate from his non-involvement at the end when Krona demanded his aid. At the end, Metron kept guard over the newly formed Cosmic egg. In the 2005 Mister Miracle miniseries, Metron contacts Shilo Norman (the current Mister Miracle) during a stunt gone wrong, making him aware of the Fourth World. In his first appearance in the book, he looks like he has before, but later he disguises himself as an epileptic man in a wheelchair. During the events of Death of the New Gods, where the mysterious deaths of the entire Fourth World accelerated, Metron tracked and discovered the mastermind: the Source itself, which has in truth been lurking in the backgrounds for millennia trying to reacquire its original powers and reunite with its other half: the Anti-Life Entity. In true form, Metron sought not to stop the Source, but rather to stand by the Source's side to watch and learn as the Fourth World of the New Gods came to an end. Eventually, after the death of Mister Miracle at the hands of the Source, Metron grows disgusted and demands his own death. The Source complies, and kills Metron before going to confront Darkseid.The Death of the New Gods #7 (May 2008). DC Comics. On the first page of Final Crisis #1, an all-silver being appears to Anthro the First Boy and proclaims, \\"I am Metron\\". Later in the issue, Doctor Light and Mirror Master are sent by Libra to recover a device that resembles Metron's chair. Other characters come to believe that Metron gave the invention of fire to mankind through Anthro.Final Crisis #1 (July 2008). DC Comics. Later, the Mister Miracle version of the character restores Nix Uotan, the fallen Monitor, to his god-like status, solving a Rubik's Cube in 17 moves—one move less than the minimum supposedly required for a human being to crack the cubes, triggering the conclusion of the Final Crisis of Humanity.Final Crisis #6. DC Comics. The Mobius Chair is later harvested by Superman to gain the precious Element X needed to power up the Miracle Machine enough to restore the Multiverse and undo all damages brought by the dark god Darkseid: in the new universe, it is revealed that every other denizen of Apokolips and New Genesis, except for Darkseid, is fated to be reborn (including Metron).Final Crisis #7. DC Comics. Metron appears in a near-death hallucination experienced by Bruce Wayne after his return to the present, encouraging Wayne to resist Darkseid's offer to embrace anti-life by encouraging him to recognize the first truth of Batman; that, despite his claims to the contrary, he has never been alone. =The New 52= In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Metron consults with Highfather about the various uses of the Lantern rings. About twenty members of the interstellar police force, the Green Lantern Corps confront Highfather and his military forces. They are trying to recover the power ring belonging to the sentient planet Mogo, who needs it to remain sentient and viable. Highfather leaves the matter to his subordinates, who slaughter most of the Lanterns. This was an action Highfather later regretted.Green Lantern #35 (October 2014). DC Comics. Metron confronts the Anti-Monitor on Earth 3 in an attempt to divert a war between the Anti-Monitor and Darkseid. A conversation between Metron and the Anti- Monitor suggests that he once sat on the Mobius Chair himself prior to Metron. Metron says that while he is sitting on the Mobius Chair, the Anti-Monitor is unable to hurt him. On the other hand, he is not immune from the attacks of others as Metron is struck from behind by Grail, Darkseid's Amazonian daughter, presumably leaving him for dead there in the Crime Syndicate's universe.Justice League vol. 2 #40 (April 2015). DC Comics. Despite this, Metron subsequently returns to confront the Justice League and warn them that they should evacuate Earth as it is impossible to win against the Anti-Monitor and Darkseid. However, Diana uses the Lasso of Truth to make Metron admit that they can find the answers if they take the chair from him, prompting Diana to pull him off the chair and Batman to sit in it, giving him access to all of Metron's accumulated knowledge.Justice League vol. 2 #42 (July 2015). DC Comics. After the Anti-Monitor and Darkseid are destroyed in battle, Metron appears on the moon where he trains Owlman, who now controls the Mobius Chair after Batman separates it, and warns him not to seek many answers. As Owlman demands to know the secrets of the universe, he and Metron are immediately vaporized in a flash of blue light by the mysterious entity, with only the Mobius Chair left intact and with blood on it. On a related note during the fight between the Justice League and Grail, Batman used Metron's Mobius Chair to learn the true identity of Joker. It told him that \\"there are three\\" which he later revealed to Hal Jordan.Justice League vol. 2 #50 (May 2016). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Like most of the New Gods, Metron is immune to all diseases, being virtually immortal. His advanced physiology provides superhuman strength and endurance in any physical activity. Metron has demonstrated numerous god-like abilities somewhat inconsistently throughout his history. Metron is a super genius who has explored the universe and gained a vast amount of knowledge. Although the New God Himon is his superior at devising scientific theories, Metron surpasses Himon as a creator of inventions based on scientific theories. Metron has also created incredible technological wonders that are too numerous to mention here. =Equipment= Metron travels in his flying Mobius Chair, which enables him to travel through time, outer space, and other dimensions. Its tractor beams are powerful enough to carry a planet along behind the chair and can create an impenetrable energy wall. Other versions In the JLA storyline Rock of Ages, an insane, evil Metron from an alternate future, where he is in service to Darkseid, has taken over Earth and possibly the entire universe. He is defeated when Batman asserts that the sole gap in his knowledge is his ignorance of what it means to be human, prompting him to use his powers to renounce his godhood, allowing Batman to knock him out with a single punch. In Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers mega series, Metron is a homeless paraplegic man in a wheelchair, having been cast out of the Fourth World as a result of Darkseid winning the war between Apokolips and New Genesis. He is seen playing chess with The Black Racer, and his wheelchair is sometimes pushed by Orion. While this story takes place in regular continuity, the section where Metron and the other New Gods appear in this state is revealed to have been one in a series of possible worlds experienced by Shilo Norman, and not the actual present.Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle #4. DC Comics. The miniseries Captain Carrot and the Final Ark features a satirical version of the New Gods, in which they are anthropomorphic canines called the New Dogs. Metron is known as Muttron, and the Mobius Chair is known as the Bark-o-lounger. Metron causes Kal-El's rocket to divert from Earth to Apokolips in the Elseworld comic Superman: The Dark Side. Metron appears briefly in the 1982 Marvel/DC crossover special The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans, wherein the two teams battle Darkseid, Deathstroke and a resurrected Dark Phoenix.

It may be classified as a pony, due to its relatively short stature (between 131–141 centimeters at the withers). Known from the 6–7th centuries, it was used as a war horse by the Lithuanians during the Northern Crusades and is hailed in Lithuania as part of the state's historic heritage. Its origin is uncertain, but it is related to indigenous forest horse breeds, Estonian native horse and the Konik, a Polish breed, which were both probably descended from the Tarpan. The breed contributed to the foundation of the Trakehner. Once popular, the breed was brought to the brink of extinction by changing agricultural demands and World War II. As of 2010, the total population is estimated at 400 individuals.  History  Known in written sources since the 6–7th centuries, the Žemaitukas became famous as an excellent war horse during the Northern Crusades. During the centuries, the breed was influenced by Tatar, Russian, light Polish, and other horses. Once widespread, the breed went almost extinct three times. In the 19th century, new agricultural machinery required taller and stronger horses. Therefore the horses were crossed with the Trakehners, Arabians, and draft horses threatening survival of pure breed Žemaitukas. The breed was saved by the Ogiński family, who established Žemaitukas breeding societies in Raseiniai, Plungė, and Rietavas between 1881 and 1890. The Ogińskis popularized the breed and exhibited it at the Paris International Agricultural Show in 1900 where the horses won two gold and one silver medals. At the end of World War II, the Germans took all Žemaitukas horses from the Gruzdžiai stud farm. A single stud was found in 1958 in Užventis. The stud was transferred to the Vilnius State Stud Farm, where a new generation of Žemaitukas horses was bred. A new challenge was presented by the dissolution of the Soviet Union and rapid de-collectivization in 1990. Horses, that belonged to the kolkhozes (collective farms), were distributed to private owners who often showed little interest in the survival of the breed. In 1994, only 30 adult individuals remained. However, the Vilnius State Stud Farm preserved its horses and remains the major breading center. As of 2010, it had 98 Žemaitukas horses.  Breed characteristics  Žemaitukai in harness Arabian blood was added during the 19th century, giving the horse an Arab-type head, including the characteristic dish-shaped Arabian profile. The infusion of Arabian blood created two subtypes of the Žemaitukas: those with Arabian ancestry were considered suitable for riding, while the other, more closely related to the indigenous horses, was better adapted to farm work. After World War II, the distinction was muted. With limited crossbreeding with North Swedish Horse, a deliberate effort was made to increase the size and bulk of the animals so that they could be used for both riding and draft work. The ponies are said to be hardy, possessing excellent stamina, disease resistant, and displaying a willing temperament. It is now a multi-purpose breed; it is ridden, used in farm work, and crossed with lighter and larger breeds to produce sport horses. The horses are usually a dun color and often display the primeval dorsal stripe, but they may also be brown, bay, black, or palomino. The Žemaitukas generally stands high, placing it among the taller pony breeds. As with other domestic animals around the world, studies have been carried out on this horse's genetic heritage, since it may possess unique characteristics. Maternal DNA sequencing indicated that one of its haplotypes is similar to an old haplotype present in horse breeds of the North East European area. In 2004 study, scientists discovered allele T, common among the Žemaitukas and observed only a few times among all other tested horse breeds. The FAO Mission Conference for Central and Eastern European countries recognized the Žemaitukas as an internationally watched breed, and included it into the FAO World Watch List for Domestic Animal Diversity.

Aluxo'ob are conceived of as being small, only about knee-high, and in appearance resembling miniature traditionally dressed Maya people. Tradition holds that aluxob are generally invisible but are able to assume physical form for purposes of communicating with and frightening humans as well as to congregate. They are generally associated with natural features such as forests, caves, stones, and fields but can also be enticed to move somewhere through offerings. Their description and mythological role are somewhat reminiscent of other sprite-like mythical entities in a number of other cultural traditions (such as the Celtic leprechaun), as the tricks they play are similar. Some Maya believe that the Aluxob are called into being when a farmer builds a little house on his property, most often in a maize field (milpa). For seven years, the alux will help the corn grow, summon rain and patrol the fields at night, whistling to scare off predators or crop thieves. At the end of seven years, the farmer must close the windows and doors of the little house, sealing the alux inside. If this is not done, the alux will run wild and start playing tricks on people. Some contemporary Maya even consider the single- and double-story shrines that dot the countryside to be kahtal alux, the \\"houses of the alux\\" (although their true origins and purpose are unknown). Stories say that they will occasionally stop and ask farmers or travellers for an offering. If they refuse, the aluxo'ob will often wreak havoc and spread illness. However, if their conditions are met, it is thought the alux will protect a person from thieves or even bring them good luck. If they are treated with respect, they can be very helpful. It is believed that it is not good to name them aloud, as it will summon a disgruntled alux from its home. The word \\"duende\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \\"alux\\". Duende is a Spanish word for a supernatural creature (commonly a goblin) or force. In fact, because of such striking similarities, some suspect that the Maya's belief of aluxob developed through interactions with the Spanish or pirates during the 16th century. Pirates of that era were often from the British Isles, where belief in faeries was quite common, especially amongst those of lower socio-economic class (as pirates generally would have been). However, the Maya themselves would claim that the alux are the spirits of their ancestors, or the spirits of the land itself, preceding contact with Western civilization. The supposition that aluxob featured in the mythical traditions of the pre-Columbian Maya is possibly supported by similar conceptions postulated from depictions in pre-Columbian artworks, but there is no direct evidence.

The Talmudic definition includes both the form of the skin and the way it is processed, in particular that it must be tanned. Since the innovative ruling of Rabbeinu Tam (12th century Tosafist) it is primarily used to refer to parchment or vellum. It is one of the materials upon which a Sofer writes certain Jewish liturgical and ritual documents. Description Klaf is a specially prepared, tanned, split skin of a kosher animal - goat, cattle, or deer. Rabbinic literature addresses three forms of tanned skin: Gevil, consisting of the full, unsplit hide; and klaf and dukhsustus which are the two halves of the full hide. Rabbinic literature is divided upon which is the inner and which is the outer of the two halves. According to the Halakhot Gedolot, klaf is the inner layer, adjacent to the flesh, while dukhsustos is the outer layer, on which the hair grows: :תניא הלכה למשה מסיני תפילין על הקלף ומזוזה על דוכסוסטוס וקלף במקום בשר ודוכסוסטוס במקום שער. :A baraita states: It is a Law given to Moses at Sinai that tefilin are written on qelaf and mezuzah on dukhsustus. Qelaf [is written] where it [faced] flesh; dukhsustus, facing hair. -- (Hilkhot Tefilin, perek 25 daf 100 in Venice 1548 printing) The same view is expressed in the oldest extant manuscripts and critical editions of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah and the Babylonian Talmud (Shab. 79b). This is also the same definition which appears in the minor Talmudic tractate called Sofrim. However, more recent authorities reverse the two descriptions, and many printed editions of the Mishneh Torah are \\"adjusted\\" to reflect this. The reason for this reversal of terms is a mystery. Some suspect that copying errors are to blame. As a result, many have become confused, in terms of which part of the skin should be used for writing. Using the full hide known as gevil for Sifrei Torah does avoid this issue, but unfortunately this solution won't work for tefilin which must be written on Klaf and are not kosher if written on gevil. This dispute may be of very little practical significance as the main schools of thought today on each side are in agreement over the identity of the klaf, with the only dispute being whether Duchsustus is the skin layer on the outside or the membrane on the inside, with writing on duchsustus having fallen out of all common practice centuries ago. However, there is a small group which breaks with the tradition and understands that the Klaf is the thin outer layer with the Duchsustus being the thicker, inner layer.) In any event in agreement is that klaf can only be written upon on its own inner layer and Duchsustus on its own outer layer. For each of sifrei torah, tefilin, and mezuzos there are different guidelines and restrictions of which form of the skin may be used i.e. tefilin can only be made from klaf. Preparation The legally required method of cleaning and preparing klaf has been altered over the centuries. During Talmudic times, salt-water and barley (or flours) were sprinkled on the skins which were then soaked in the juice of afatsim (gall nuts, or Oak apples). Nowadays, most processors dip the skins in clear water for two days, and then soak them in limewater for nine days to remove the hair. When it is a hairless surface, the scribe stretches it on a wooden drying frame and scrapes it until it is dry. Creases are ironed out with presses. Then it is sanded until it becomes a flat, smooth sheet fit for writing. The reasons for the change in this process are lengthy and controversial. Today, a few Jewish scribes still prepare klaf in precise accordance with the Jewish Law. Some parchment (usually poor quality) is smeared with log, a chalky substance, to make it whiter. Occasionally this is only done on the reverse. Some scribes object to the use of log as it forms a barrier between the ink and the parchment. Uses In Talmudic times klaf was primarily only used for tefilin and at times mezuzos however since the 9th or 10th centuries it has become more widespread to write Sifrei Torah on klaf however, even today, there are still groups who continue to adhere to the ancient prescription described in the Talmud, and continue to write on gevil. Intent The parchment must be prepared \\"for the sake of heaven\\" (i.e. with the intent of performing a Divine act) and the processor must declare what he is preparing it for, as one cannot use k'laf destined for a lesser holiness (kedusha kallah) - e.g. a mezuzah to write tefillin or a Sefer Torah, which are of weightier holiness (kedusha chamurah). If necessary, the scribe should state that he is preparing for the sake of a Sefer Torah but that he may change his mind if he wishes. Some believe that when a Jew is unable to prepare the parchment, then in exceptional circumstances, a non-Jew may prepare it. However, a Jew must stand over him, directing him in his work and stating that the preparation is for the sake of heaven. However, this issue is not universally accepted. Current production Today there is a large amount of Klaf processed under rabbinical supervision, and the variety, quality and quantity is increasing.

Incident with John Safran John Safran, an Australian documentarian and media personality, created a television pilot called John Safran: Media Tycoon which was focused on the media industry. It became infamous for a segment where Safran turned up to Martin's house and harassed him in the tabloid style characteristic of A Current Affair and its peers. Martin was in contact with the ABC and specifically warned Safran in the segment that he had spoken to Roger Grant, the then Head of Corporate Affairs at the ABC. The segment was later played on Media Watch on ABC and on Enough Rope. Safran went through Martin's garbage and took Shane Paxton (a former A Current Affair story subject) to embarrass Martin.

It was originally bred in England by Lady Wentworth at the Crabbet Arabian Stud in the early 1900s from imported Arabian stallions and Welsh pony mares. Breeding then spread throughout North America. In 1981, a breed registry was formed in the United States, and a studbook began to be published. They are used for many disciplines of English riding, and are known for their refinement, hardiness and spirit. Breed characteristics Welara stallions average and mares . To be registered, Welaras must stand between high. Crosses between Arabians and each of the four sections of Welsh Pony (A, B, C and D) tend to produce slightly different types of pony. Section A Welsh Pony crosses (the smallest) tend to be under , and be used mainly as light driving ponies and mounts for small children. Section B crosses usually stand and can be used for driving and as riding ponies for larger children and small adults. Section C crosses average hands and tend to be a heavier pony, sometimes with feathered feet, although still showing the refinement of their Arabian ancestors. Section D crosses generally stand high. The latter two types are suited to riding by average and slightly larger adults and for the majority of disciplines. All colors other than Appaloosa are allowed for registration. Welara Sport Ponies may be of any color or size, without the restrictions of the purebred Welara. The mix of Arabian and Welsh blood gives the breed refinement, spirit and hardiness, as well as good movement. The head is small and slightly concave, the neck is arched (and prone to be cresty in stallions). The shoulders and croup are long and the back short. Welaras are used mainly in English riding, especially in hunter classes. They are also seen in show jumping, three-day eventing, pleasure driving and as general leisure riding horses. Welara/Thoroughbred crosses are popular mounts for riders competing in hunter and jumper classes. History Lady Wentworth, original breeder of the Welara Crosses began to be made between the Arabian horse and the Welsh Pony in Sussex, England the early 1900s, by Lady Wentworth of the Crabbet Arabian Stud. She began breeding Arabian stallions, including Skowronek (1909–1930), a Polish Arabian stud, to Welsh mares from North Wales, especially the Coed Coch stud farm, which she imported beginning in the early 1920s. Other breeders in England and North America soon followed suit, although at this time they were not focused on creating a new breed, and the cross became known as the Welara. In 1981, a breed registry, called the American Welara Pony Registry, was created in the US in order to develop and promote the breed. A studbook also began to be published, and pedigrees of Welaras were collected and preserved. Only Welsh and Arabian blood is allowed for purebreds, and all registered ponies must have at least 1/8 and no more than 7/8 blood from each breed. As of 2005, the registry claimed slightly over 1,500 ponies registered in North America, with around 100 new foals registered annually. Welara Sport Ponies may also be registered – these are ponies at least 50 percent Welara but with blood from other breeds, often the Thoroughbred. The association also registers pureblood Welsh and Arabian foundation stock. Welaras have now spread to additional areas of the world, including the Caribbean, Oceania and Europe. In Europe, Welsh/Arabian crosses, sometimes with additional Thoroughbred blood, are often called \\"riding ponies\\" or \\"sport ponies\\".

History  Vyatka stallion in 1902 The Vyatka was influenced by the climate and terrain of the Kirov, Udmurtia and western Perm regions; Estonian horses and Kleppers brought to northern Russia in the fourteenth century by Novgorod colonists may have affected its conformation, as may later imports of Estonian horses for mining work in the Ural Mountains. The Vyatka was valued for its endurance, speed and frugality. By the middle of the nineteenth century it was considered the best horse for pulling troikas; some were exported from the Vyatka region, including to Poland. In 1917 the breed was virtually extinct; some efforts at re-establishment were made after the Russian Revolution. Numbers in the Kirov and Udmurtia were estimated at 2000 in 1980.

He is a World Cup-winning goalkeeper who played for most of his career in Argentina and Mexico. As a coach, La Volpe was in charge of both the Mexico and Costa Rica national teams, coaching the former at the 2006 World Cup. As a club manager, he won the league title in the 1992–93 season with Atlante. On 22 April 2020, in an interview with David Faitelson, he announced his retirement from management.  Playing career  In Argentina, La Volpe played for Banfield and San Lorenzo. In Mexico he played for Atlante and Oaxtepec. La Volpe made eight total appearances with Argentina throughout his career. He won, as the reserve goalkeeper, the 1978 FIFA World Cup with Argentina.  Managerial career  Early career = Ricardo La Volpe began his career as a coach in the Mexican league in 1989, managing several teams such as Oaxtepec, Puebla, Atlante, Guadalajara, Querétaro, América, Atlas, Toluca, and Monterrey. Despite mixed results, La Volpe earned a reputation for his offensive-style of football. He led Atlante to the 1992–1993 season championship and reached the league final with Atlas in 1999. = Mexico national team = In 2002 La Volpe was named coach of the Mexico national team. He led the team to win the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup and qualified for the 2006 World Cup, as well finishing in fourth place at the 2005 Confederations Cup, most notably defeating eventual champions Brazil in the group stage. With La Volpe at the helm, Mexico reached fourth place in the FIFA World rankings. Also under his leadership at the 2004 Copa América, Mexico managed to defeat Argentina for the first time in years, but lost to Brazil in the quarterfinals. Mexico also lost at the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup quarterfinals to Colombia. Mexico was also eliminated at the 2004 Olympic Games after losing to South Korea in the group stage. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Mexico finished second in their group, qualifying to the Round of 16 before going out 1–2 in extra time to Argentina. The Guardian named him Best Coach of the World Cup for his attitude. = Boca Juniors = After leaving the Mexico national team, he met with Boca Juniors officials on 24 July 2006. After several weeks of negotiation, it was agreed on 22 August that La Volpe would take over as Boca manager on 15 September, replacing Alfio Basile who had been selected to manage the Argentina national team. La Volpe had a bumpy start with Boca Juniors, including a 3–1 loss against archi-rivals River Plate on 8 October. On 12 October, Boca lost 3–1 to Uruguayan club Nacional on penalty kicks in the Copa Sudamericana, and so were out of the competition. Boca failed three times to claim the Apertura Championship in the final weeks of the season, and then lost a playoff against Estudiantes. Keeping his word that he would quit if he lost, La Volpe resigned after the match. Later that year he became the new Vélez Sársfield manager, but did not stay in the job long. After watching his team suffer bruising defeats by River Plate and Boca Juniors in the Apertura 2007, and his team in 10th place, he resigned as coach. = Return to Mexico = In 2008, Ricardo La Volpe returned to Mexico as manager of Monterrey. After several days of speculation, the decision was finally announced in the club's official website, as the replacement of former manager Isaac Mizrahi. He had a bumpy start, and didn't win until his fifth match. Monterrey finished the season in 8th place and had the league's leading goal scorer, Humberto Suazo. Monterrey's league would end in the semi-finals in which they were eliminated by Santos Laguna after an aggregate score of 3–3 Fans of Monterrey spoke highly of La Volpe for helping the team reach the playoffs again after two dismal seasons of not qualifying including a last place finish during the last tournament. In the Apertura 2008 the team would have a fairly good start, but completely fell apart towards the end of the tournament placing Monterrey in the bottom of the table, hence not qualifying to the playoffs. After the disappointing tournament, the team did not offer the money La Volpe was looking for and he decided to leave the team. = Return to Atlas = On 28 January 2009, La Volpe signed, once again, with Atlas. Fans of the team had been yearning for him to come back to the squad in which many said he had his most success. The tournament was not successful with the team failing to qualify to the playoffs, finishing 13th. On 18 November the Argentine coach quit Atlas due to poor results, and was replaced by Carlos Ischia.Sale Ricardo Lavolpe del Atlas  Milenio.comElogios a Ischia  Milenio.com = Costa Rica = On 9 September 2010, the former Atlas coach became the new manager of Costa Rica, replacing interim coach Rónald González. The Argentine had originally signed until July 2014, however, poor performance during the 2011 Gold Cup and 2011 Copa América, ended his contract prematurely on 11 August 2011. = Guadalajara = La Volpe was named Guadalajara manager after a 4–0 loss against América with just four games to go in the tournament. After a win against Pachuca on his debut, he finished the league with a draw and 2 losses. However, on 30 April 2014, La Volpe was fired by Vergara after an accusation by a female staff member of improper behavior by La Volpe on her and Vergara announced that there was a lawsuit against La Volpe for that matter.http://televisadeportes.esmas.com/futbol/futbolmexico/equipos/guadalajara/715235/corren- volpe/ = América = Following the sacking of Club América's manager Ignacio Ambríz, La Volpe was announced as manager on 22 September 2016. He won his first game in charge two days later, defeating Universidad Nacional 2–1. He led América towards a strong final stretch at the end of 2016, culminating with a fourth-place finish at the FIFA Club World Cuphttp://laaficion.milenio.com/america/mundial_de_clubes-club_america- tercer_lugar-atletico_nacional-fifa-milenio-la_aficion_0_867513458.html and finishing runners-up in the Apertura championship match against Tigres UANL.http://www.espn.com.mx/futbol/cronica?juegoId=468819 Although contributing by debuting major prospects such as Diego Lainez and Edson Álvarez, Lavolpe and America decided to part ways after a lackluster Clausura 2017 where America failed to qualify to the playoffs for the first time since 2011.http://laaficion.milenio.com/america/ricardo_la_volpe-america-pachuca- liguilla-tecnico-renuncia-milenio-la_aficion_0_952104896.html  Reception  Influence = La Volpe's philosophy, style of play, and attitude is referred to as \\"Lavolpismo\\". Coaches who have studied under and continue to use a modified version of his style of play and philosophy are referred to as \\"Lavolpistas\\". Notable managers directly influenced by La Volpe include Miguel Herrera, José Guadalupe Cruz, Rubén Omar Romano, Hernan Cristante, Jose Saturnino Cardozo and Sergio Bueno.https://www.elgrafico.com/futbol/De- seleccionador-mexicano-a-youtuber-el-nuevo-pasatiempo-de-Ricardo-La-Volpe-- 20171227-0011.html = Criticism = During Mexico's first group-stage match in the 2006 World Cup against Iran, La Volpe was seen chain-smoking in the dugout, leading to an official warning from FIFA that he was not allowed to smoke in the competition area. La Volpe responded by telling FIFA's executives that he would \\"rather give up football than smoking\\", although he later consented.http://www.midfielddynamo.com/gaffers/gaffers_smoking.htm He has also had clashes with the press. During a press conference at the 2006 World Cup, La Volpe told a journalist: \\"¡Fuera de mi vista! No saben nada. No me rompan los huevos, idiotas.\\" [\\"Get out of my face! You know nothing. Don't break my balls, you idiots.\\"] He has odd superstitions some which include wearing a lucky tie, performing oriental rituals and avoiding shaking the opposing managers hand prior to or after the game.http://www.record.com.mx/empelotados/desde-una-corbata-hasta-un-ataud- las-cabalas-de-la-volpe  Honours  As a player = ;Argentina *FIFA World Cup: 1978 = As a manager = ;Atlante *Primera División de México: 1992–93 ;Mexico *CONCACAF Gold Cup: 2003 ;Individual *Primera División de México Manager of the Tournament:1992–93  References  External links  * * Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentina international footballers Category:1978 FIFA World Cup players Category:FIFA World Cup-winning players Category:Banfield footballers Category:San Lorenzo footballers Category:Atlante F.C. footballers Category:C.F.

The club was formed during the rationalisation process of the NRL by the merger of the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles and the North Sydney Bears in 2000. The team shared home games between Brookvale Oval and Central Coast Stadium, Gosford, New South Wales. Little success was had during three seasons (2000-2002), finishing 12th, 10th, and 9th, winning 30 of 76 games. Also, the new club's decision to play games in Gosford instead of the Bears home ground at North Sydney Oval alienated several North Sydney fans, despite North Sydney's planned move to the new Central Coast Stadium, which had been rebuilt for the Bears on the site of the old Grahame Park ground. In spite of this, the club provided more players for the 2001 State of Origin series' New South Wales team than any other club. The partnership folded in 2002, with Manly emerging as the stand-alone entity. The 2002 season was played under the Northern Eagles name, although effectively the club was the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles by another name. Halfway through the season, the Eagles even abandoned playing games at Gosford, due to a sharp decline in attendances. The people of Gosford preferred to wait until a home grown team was based there. The Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles name and colours returned to the NRL in 2003. North Sydney now field a team in the Canterbury Cup NSW, the competition immediately below NRL level, as a feeder to the Sydney Roosters. There are plans to again be part of the NRL in coming years as the Central Coast Bears. Home grounds The Northern Eagles shared their home games between Brookvale Oval in Sydney and Grahame Park in Gosford. The record attendance for the club was 20,059 for the club's opening game against the Newcastle Knights at Grahame Park on 6 February 2000. The record attendance for the club at Brookvale Oval was 14,521 against Cronulla on 21 July 2002. Players A total of sixty nine players played for the club. Steve Menzies played the most games for the club, with 69 caps.Northern Eagles rugbyleagueproject.org =State of OriginNew South Wales * Geoff Toovey (2000) * Adam Muir (2000–01) * Steve Menzies (2001–02) * Brett Kimmorley (2001) =City Vs Country originNSW City * Steve Menzies (2001) NSW Country * Brett Kimmorley (2001) RecordsClub records= Biggest win * 28 points, 30–2 against Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks at Brookvale Oval on 18 March 2000 Biggest loss * 58 points, 10–68 against New Zealand Warriors at Ericsson Stadium on 14 April 2002 Most consecutive wins * 2 matches, 21–26 February 2000 * 2 matches, 23–29 April 2000 * 2 matches, 25 June - 2 July 2000 * 2 matches, 22–28 April 2001 * 2 matches, 23–29 June 2002 * 2 matches, 4–11 August 2002 Most consecutive losses * 4 matches, 25 March - 15 April 2000 * 4 matches, 9–30 July 2000 * 4 matches, 25 August 2001 – 30 March 2002 Most points in a season * Ben Walker - 279 (18 tries, 103 goals, 1 field goal) in 2001 Record attendance * 20,059 vs Newcastle Knights at NorthPower Stadium, 6 February 2000 * 14,521 vs Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks at Brookvale Oval, 21 July 2002 Post 2003 Since the Northern Eagles folded at the end of 2002, Manly-Warringah and North Sydney have gone their separate ways. Manly officially returned to the NRL in 2003 (playing out of Brookvale Oval, though they played at least two games per season in Gosford until 2015) and have since played in four NRL Grand Finals (2007, 2008, 2011 and 2013), winning the premiership in 2008 and 2011. North Sydney began playing in the NSW Cup (formerly known as Reserve Grade) at their traditional base, North Sydney Oval, where they are the feeder team to the Sydney Roosters. Before this, Norths were the feeder team for South Sydney from 2007 to 2018. As of 2014, there have been several attempts for the Bears to come back into the NRL by being based at the Central Coast, North Sydney, Perth, Gold Coast and Brisbane. Former North Sydney internationals Greg Florimo and David Fairleigh play a prominent role in the club's push to join the NRL. So far they have failed to gain a licence to re-enter the NRL with the latest push of buying the Manly Sea Eagles licence from Penn Sports for $6,000,000 after a failed attempt by Qatar to buy Manly for $22,000,000 a week earlier.

Don Haskins portrayed by Josh Lucas, head coach of Texas Western College (now known as University of Texas at El Paso or UTEP), coached a team with an all-black starting lineup, a first in NCAA history. Glory Road explores racism, discrimination, and student athletics. Supporting actors Jon Voight and Derek Luke also star in principal roles. The film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of Walt Disney Pictures, Jerry Bruckheimer Films, Texas Western Productions, and Glory Road Productions. It was commercially distributed by Buena Vista Pictures theatrically and by the Buena Vista Home Entertainment division for the video rental market. It premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on January 13, 2006, grossing $42,938,449 in box office business despite generally mixed reviews from critics. Glory Road was nominated for a number of awards including the Humanitas Prize; the film won the 2006 ESPY Award for Best Sports Movie. On January 10, 2006, the original motion picture soundtrack was released by the Hollywood Records music label. The soundtrack was composed and orchestrated by musician Trevor Rabin. The DVD release, featuring theatrical trailers, extended interviews with players and colleagues of coach Haskins, and deleted scenes, among other highlights, was released in the U.S. on June 6, 2006. Plot Newly appointed men's basketball coach Don Haskins gets a new job at Texas Western College in El Paso. Lacking necessary financial resources, he makes an effort to recruit the best players regardless of race to form a team that can compete for a national championship. Some of the young men he brings in possess skill, but are raw in talent when it comes to organized teamwork focusing on defense and ball distribution. In the end, his Texas Western Miners team comprises seven black and five white athletes; a balance that raises eyebrows among university personnel. Haskins puts his players through a rigorous training program, threatening to cut anyone who doesn't work as hard as he demands, while trying to integrate his players into a single team with a common goal. Following initial victories against mediocre local teams, Haskins quickly discovers that he has to give his black players more free room on the court. Yet, the more victories his team achieves with its flamboyant style, up until this point rarely seen in college basketball, the more racial hatred mounts on his squad. This culminates in threats to his own family, the beating of a player while on the road and ultimately the vandalism of his team's motel rooms by racists while they are at an away game. Increasingly frightened, the team loses its last game of the regular season after the black players stop playing with passion. Thus, the Texas Western Miners finish the 1965–1966 regular season with a 23–1 record, entering the 1966 NCAA tournament ranked third in the nation. Going on to the NCAA final, played at College Park, Maryland, they take on the top-ranked University of Kentucky under legendary coach Adolph Rupp. Rupp, with a well-organized and more experienced all-white Wildcats squad, firmly believes that his opponent stands no chance. On the eve of the decisive game, Haskins decides to experiment with a bold strategy, informing his team that he intends to start an all-black lineup in the game, and also only using the two other black players in the rotation. In the midst of seemingly insurmountable odds, Texas Western encounters mounting problems with forward and team captain Harry Flournoy leaving the game with an injury, and their center David Lattin in foul trouble. In a close game, the Miners narrowly lead at halftime, but finally manage to beat Kentucky 72–65 with some impressive steals, rebounding and passing techniques in the second half. The film ends with the players exiting the plane that brought them back to El Paso to the greeting of a raucous crowd.

The book details Haskins' early life as a player (including a one-on-one game against a black friend that opened his eyes) and women's basketball coach. Like the film, it then focuses on the 1966 Texas Western men's basketball team and the aftermath of the championship. It was reprinted five times in its first four months of release and was selected as an \\"Editor's Choice\\" by the New York Times Book Review. Additionally, Glory Road is the name of a street on the UTEP campus near the Sun Bowl which was renamed to commemorate the 1966 NCAA championship. Later asked about his decision to start five black players, Haskins downplayed the significance of his decision. \\"I really didn't think about starting five black guys. I just wanted to put my five best guys on the court. I just wanted to win the game.\\"Limón, Iliana. \\"Ex-Miners coach Don Haskins wasn't playing the hero during a racially charged 1966 championship, but Hollywood doesn't seem to mind.\\" Albuquerque Tribune. 11 January 2006. Though credited with advancing the desegregation of college basketball teams in the South, he wrote in his book \\"I certainly did not expect to be some racial pioneer or to change the world.\\"Haskins, Don with Dan Wetzel. Glory Road. New York:Hyperion, 2006. . Dunking was banned in the NCAA from 1967 to 1976, not the least due to the success of the Texas Western team and UCLA player Lew Alcindor (better known later as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), who was just then becoming NCAA varsity eligible. Next to the closing credits, scenes from interviews with some of the real-life players from the team are shown, including one player from the opposing University of Kentucky team beaten by Texas Western in the NCAA finals, NBA head coach Pat Riley. The real-life Don Haskins was cast as an extra in the film as a gas station attendant, and David Lattin was cast as an extra as a military bartender. The players on the 1966 team were David Lattin, Bobby Joe Hill, Willie Cager, Willie Worsley, Jerry Armstrong, Orsten Artis, Nevil Shed, Harry Flournoy, Togo Railey, Louis Baudoin, Dick Myers, and David Palacio. The team was nominated in its entirety for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and was inducted on September 7, 2007, ten years after coach Don Haskins had already been enshrined. The movie skipped a crucial game that Texas Western had played. On March 18, 1966, the Miners defeated Utah 85-78 in the Final Four to advance to the national championship game the following night. In the movie the team played against Kansas in the regional final and the following game was the national championship, which is incorrect. =Filming= Several scenes in this movie were filmed at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), which is the former Texas Western College, and El Paso High School in El Paso, Texas. Other scenes were filmed at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, Louisiana, Jesuit High School and Douglas High School, formerly F. T. Nicholls High School, in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Chalmette High School in Chalmette, Louisiana. The IHOP scene was filmed in the old Airline Motors Diner on Airline Highway just west of New Orleans. The school shown for the girls' basketball game in Fort Worth, Texas at the beginning of the film is actually the front of El Paso High School, as shown by the engraving on the top of the columns. The lunchroom basketball trash can scene was filmed at Booker T. Washington High School, the first high school built in New Orleans for African-Americans. Towards the beginning of the film for the shot of Texas Western College, the Wells Fargo Plaza and the Chase Bank Building in downtown El Paso can be seen in the top left corner. The Wells Fargo Plaza was not completed until 1971, and the Chase Bank Building was still the Texas Commerce Bank building until the early 1990s. In addition, Ralph Strangis (the former Dallas Stars play-by-play announcer) had a small speaking role as a courtside broadcaster. Ben Affleck was the original choice for the role of coach Don Haskins, but had to drop out of the filming due to prior commitments. NBA point guard Kirk Hinrich was offered a role in the film, but chose not to participate \\"because of time constraints\\".Sam Smith. \\"Skiles lauds Chandler's play; Coach calls game 7-footer's best yet\\". Chicago Tribune. November 21, 2005. Sports, pg. 5 During the scene of the Texas Western-Seattle University basketball game broadcast the announcers inadvertently used the call letters WTSM, which is an FM radio sports station from Tallahassee, Florida instead of the El Paso station KTSM. =Controversy= Kentucky Wildcat fans and other Rupp supporters said the film at least implicitly portrayed UK coach Adolph Rupp as a racist, with such lines as Bobby Joe Hill's that Rupp would not have recruited him. Like other teams in the Southeastern Conference, Kentucky was indeed all-white, but they were the first (and for about a decade, the only) SEC team to regularly play (inter-conference) opponents with black players (starting in the 1950s) and, in fact, took the place of Alabama (1956) and Mississippi State (1959, 1961) in the NCAA Tournament after their respective state legislatures and/or university leadership refused the invitations because of the possibility of playing against integrated squads. Starting in 1964, Rupp had recruited Kentuckians Wes Unseld and Butch Beard along with eight other black players who received formal scholarship offers before Tom Payne in 1969 became UK's first black player. But while doing so he told them (just as Branch Rickey did to Jackie Robinson) about the racial difficulties they could expect in playing in the SEC and Unseld and Beard went to Louisville instead. In the game between East Texas State University, now known as Texas A&M; University–Commerce, and Texas Western, East Texas State fans are shown throwing popcorn and drinks, and yelling racial epithets. In a later scene, racial slurs are shown painted onto the hotel rooms of the black Texas Western players.

The President of Texas A&M;–Commerce said that, given the way the school was shown in the film, it was hard to believe that Disney could plausibly argue that the portrayal of the school was unintentional.

Dictionary of the Middle Ages (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1983) p. 6 or before) was a 5th–6th-century Abbot of Llancarfan, near Cowbridge in Glamorganshire, Wales, a monastery famous from the era of the British church as a centre of learning, where Illtud spent the first period of his religious life under Cadoc's tutelage. Cadoc is credited with the establishment of many churches in Cornwall, Brittany,Martyrologium Romanum, 2004, Vatican Press (Typis Vaticanis), page 529. Dyfed and Scotland. He is known as Cattwg Ddoeth, \\"the Wise\\", and a large collection of his maxims and moral sayings were included in Volume III of the Myvyrian Archaiology. He is listed in the 2004 edition of the Roman Martyrology under 21 September. His Norman-era \\"Life\\" is a hagiography of importance to the case for the historicity of Arthur as one of seven saints' lives that mention Arthur independently of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae. Biography Cadoc's story appears in a Vita Cadoci written shortly before 1086 by Lifris of Llancarfan;The text is Latin: for confirmation of before ca 1086 as the most likely date for the text, see below. \\"it was clearly written at Llancarfan with the purpose of honouring the house and confirming its endowments,\\"Tatlock, J. S. P. (1939) \\"The Dates of the Arthurian Saints' Legends\\", Speculum 14.3 (July 1939:345–365) p. 345 Consequently, it is of limited historical merit though some details are of interest. Llancarfan did not survive the intrusion of Norman power into South Wales, being dissolved about 1086.The date was argued for by J. S. P. Tatlock, \\"Caradoc of Llancarfan,\\" Speculum 13, 144–45. Cadoc began life under a cloud of violence. His father, Gwynllyw the Bearded, was one of the lesser kings of Wales, a brother of Saint Petroc, and a robber chieftain. He wanted to propose to Princess Gwladys, daughter of King Brychan of Brycheiniog, a neighboring chieftain, but Brychan turned away the envoys asking for Gwladys' hand. Wildly in love, Gwynllyw and Gwladys eloped from her father’s court at Brecon and escaped over the mountains in a raid in which 200 of Gwynllyw's 300 followers perished. Born into the royal families of Gwynllwg and Brycheiniog, it is said, he worked miracles even before his birth. Strange lights shone in his parents’ house and the cellars were miraculously filled with food. Cadoc was born in Monmouthshire around the year 497. An angel announced his birth and summoned the hermit Meuthi to baptise and teach him. A holy well sprang up for his baptism and afterwards flowed with wine and milk. It is thought that he was baptised as Cathmail (Cadfael). After the birth of his son, Gwynllyw went on a wild celebratory raid with a new band of fearless warriors. Among other livestock, he stole the cow of an Irish monk, St. Tathyw of Caerwent. This is probably Tathan, a reputed early abbot of nearby Caerwent whose dedications appear around Llantwit Major. Tathyw was not afraid of Gwynllyw and boldly went to confront him, demanding the return of the cow. On a sudden impulse, or perhaps guided by divine inspiration, Gwynllyw decided Cadoc would go to live under the monk's care, and he was sent away to be educated at Tathyw's monastery in Caerwent. Cadoc picked up a basic knowledge of Latin and received a rudimentary education that prepared him for further studies in Ireland and Wales. Most important, Cadoc learned to appreciate the life of a monk and a priest. One day while in the Cardiff district of Glamorganshire, Cadoc was being chased by an armed swineherd from an enemy tribe. As he ran through the woods looking for a place to hide, he came upon a wild boar, white with age. Disturbed by his presence, the boar made three fierce bounds in his direction, but Cadoc's life was spared when the boar miraculously disappeared. Cadoc took this as a heavenly sign, and marked the spot with three tree branches. The valley was owned by his uncle, King Pawl of Penychen, who made a present of the land to his nephew. The location later became the site of the great church college and monastery at Llancarvan. Maches (Latin: Machuta), the sister of Cadoc according to tradition, was killed by robbers who were stealing her finest ram. Tathan, to whom the murderers confessed their crime, built a church on the spot.Hando, F.J., (1958) \\"Out and About in Monmouthshire\\", R. H. Johns, Newport. In adulthood Cadoc refused to take charge of his father's army, \\"preferring to fight for Christ\\". He founded his first monastery at Llancarfan in the Vale of Glamorgan, and from there he went to Ireland to study for three years. Returning to Wales, he studied with Bachan or Pachan, a teacher of rhetoric from Italy.Bartrum, Peter C. \\"Bachan\\" in A Welsh Classical Dictionary: People in History and Legend up to about A. D. 1000, p. 38 . National Library of Wales, 1993. Emended 2009. He then travelled to Scotland where he founded a monastery at Cambuslang. Back at Llancarfan, his influence helped it to grow into one of the chief monasteries in South Wales. One tradition has it that he went on pilgrimage to Rome, but more certain is the knowledge of time spent in Brittany. He settled there on an island in the Etel river, now called L'Ile de Cado, where he built an oratory, founded a monastery and devoted himself to spreading the Gospel. There are chapels dedicated to him at Belz and Locoal- Mendon in Morbihan and at Gouesnac'h in Finistère, where he is called upon to cure the deaf. His name is also the basis of some thirty Breton place-names. =Llancarfan= St Catwg window in Caerphilly According to Huddleston, most Welsh writers assign the founding of Llancarfan to the period of St. Germanus's visit to Britain in A.D. 447, stating further that the first principal was St. Dubric, or Dubricius, on whose elevation to the episcopate St. Cadoc, or Cattwg, succeeded. On the other hand, he notes that the Life of St. Germanus, written by Constantius, a priest of Lyons, about fifty years after the death of the saint, says nothing at all of any school founded by him or under his auspices, in Britain, nor is mention made of his presence in Wales.Huddleston, Gilbert. \\"Llancarvan.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia . Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 7 January 2013 An alternate tradition holds that Llancarvan monastery or \\"Church of the Stags\\", in Glamorganshire, and not far from the Bristol Channel, was founded in the latter part of the fifth century by Cadoc. Here he established a monastery and college, which became the seminary of many great and holy men. The spot at first seemed an impossible one, an almost inaccessible marsh, but he and his monks drained and cultivated it, transforming it into one of the most famous and attractive religious homes in South Wales. The plan of the building included a monastery, a college, and a hospital.Chandlery, Peter. \\"Welsh Monastic Foundations.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia . Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 22 July 2013 Having got the community established, he went off to Ireland to study and teach. When he returned three years later, he found the monastery in ruins. Furious, he forced the monks back to manual labour, dragging timber from the woods to begin the work of reconstruction. Two stags came out of the forest to help them, which is said to be why the stream running past the monastery is called the Nant Carfan, the Stag Brook. Rev. Rees suggests that although the monastery was said to have been situated at Llancarfan, the particular spot on which it stood was called Llanfeithin. =Scotland= About 528, after his father's death, Cadoc is said to have built a stone monastery in Scotland probably at Kilmadock, which was named for the saint, north-west of Stirling,The New Statistical Account of Scotland, Perth, Vol. X, 1845, p. 1224; Doune Historical Notes, Forth Naturalist and Historian, Moray S. Mackay, Stirling, 1984, p. 72; Kilmadock in Dunblane Diocese, Society of Friends of Dunblane Cathedral, Moray S. Mackay, Vol. XI. Part III, 1972, p. 83-85. where the Annant Burn enters the River Teith about 2 miles upstream from Doune. Near the ruins of the old Kilmadock church and graveyard is Hermit's Croft, thought to be where he lived for seven years. Seven local churches that were built in his name came under the authority of Inchmahome Priory. It is also said that Cadoc's monastery was \\"below Mount Bannauc\\" (generally taken to be the hill southwest of Stirling down which the Bannockburn flows). It has been suggested that the monastery was where the town of St Ninians now stands, two kilometers south of Stirling. Scottish followers were known as \\"Gille Dog\\", the servants of Cadog, which appears as a surname, first as Dog, and later as Doig, Dock, and Doak. LegendsCadoc and Arthur= St Cadoc's Church, Caerleon Cadoc came into conflict with Arthur: the Vita depicts Arthur as great and bold, but willful. Lifris writes that Cadoc gave protection to a man who had killed three of Arthur's soldiers and Arthur was awarded a herd of cattle from Cadoc as compensation. Cadoc delivered them, but when Arthur took possession of them they were transformed into bundles of ferns. Similar incidents are often described in mediaeval biographies such as those of Carannog, Padern and Goeznovius: miracles in dealings with temporal authority bolster the case for church freedom. In later Arthurian Welsh Triads Cadoc, with Illtud and Peredur, is one of three knights said to have become keepers of the Holy Grail.Alban Butler, Butler's Lives of the Saints – Volume 11, Page 44, Paul Burns, 1995 – quoting Bromwich The kings Maelgwn of Gwynedd and Rhain Dremrudd of Brycheiniog also feature in the Vita. Though Saint Cadoc's Church at Caerleon, which, though of Norman origin and much rebuilt, stands on the foundations of the Roman legion headquarters, may memorialize an early cell of Cadoc's. Caerleon was also associated with Arthur. =Other legends= A certain miraculous spot associated with Cadoc had a reputed healing effect until the time of king Hiuguel (Hywel vab weyn, who died in his old age ca. 1041–44) when, due to a malevolent influence, the spot was lost.usque ad tempus Hiuguel regis, filii Ouguenii regis Morganensium (quoted in Tatlock 1939:346.) This Cadoc, grandson of Brychan Brycheiniog, to whose offspring a large number of south-west British cult sites are dedicated, may be identical to or confused with Cadoc son of Brychan, for whom the churches at Llanspyddid near Brecon and at Llangadog Carmarthenshire, are said to be named along with a former chapel in the parish of Kidwelly. According to Serenus de Cressy this Cadoc died AD 490, is buried in France, and is commemorated in the Calendar on 24 January. The epithet of Doeth (Welsh for wise) induced some writers to confound him with St. Sophias (Greek for wisdom), bishop of Beneventum in Italy. Hence he is said sometimes to have died at Bannaventa (Weedon, five kilometres east of Daventry in Northamptonshire),\\"Certain innocent moderns, anxious to extract the uttermost farthing of historical truth from this yarn, have tried to identify 'Beneventana civitas' with some place in Britain,\\" Tatlock observed and pointed out that the circular Lombard church in Beneventum was dedicated to Saint Sophias, \\"a scarce name among saints. The inference is obvious that some Welsh visitor to Benevento had found there some name or anecdote to excuse the attractive invention that Cadoc had been there and was Sofia.\\" (Tatlock 1939:346). in an episode towards the end of his vita Cadoc is carried off in a cloud from Britannia (de terra Britannie) to Beneventum, where a certain prior is warned of the coming of a \\"western Briton\\" who is to be renamed Sophias; as Sophias Cadoc becomes abbot, bishop and martyr. A magna basilica was erected over his shrine, which visiting Britons were not allowed to enter. A fictitious \\"Pope Alexander\\" is made to figure in the narrative. =Legendary genealogy= The parish church of St Cadoc, Llancarfan In Lives of the Cambro British saints (1853), Rev W. J Rees wrote: > The genealogy of the blessed Cadoc arises from the most noble emperors of > Rome, from the time of the incarnation of Jesus Christ, Augustus Cesar, in > whose time Christ was born, begat Octavianus, Octavianus begat Tiberius, > Tiberius begat Caius, Caius begat Claudius, Claudius begat Vespasian, > Vespasian begat Titus, Titus begat Domitian, Domitian begat Nero, under whom > the apostles Peter and Paul suffered, Nero begat Trajan, Trajan begat > Adrian, Adrian begat Antonius, Antonius begat Commodus, Commodus begat > Meobus, Meobus begat Severus, Severus begat Antonius, Antonius begat > Aucanus, Aucanus begat Aurelian, Aurelian begat Alexander, Alexander begat > Maximus, Maximus begat Gordian, Gordian begat Philip, Philip begat Decius, > Decius begat Gallus, Callus begat Valerian, Valerian begat Cleopatra, > Cleopatra begat Aurelian, Aurelian begat Titus, Titus begat Probus, Probus > begat Carosius, Carosius begat Dioclesian, who perscuted the Christians > throughout the whole world; for in his time the blessed martyrs Alban, that > is Julian, Aaron, and many others suffered.

Liturgical celebration In the 2004 edition of the Roman Martyrology, Cadoc is listed among saints thought to have died on 21 September, with the Latin name Cadóci. He is mentioned as follows: 'In the monastery at Llancarfan in South Wales, Saint Cadoc the Abbot, under whose name many monasteries in Cornwall and Brittany were established.' He does not appear in the current Roman Catholic liturgical calendar of saints celebrated annually in Wales. 21 September is, however, the feast day of the Apostle Saint Matthew, and in Cardiff, St Cadoc's Day has traditionally been kept on 25 September; on the French , a major pardon is traditionally celebrated on the third Sunday in September. Elsewhere his traditional feast day is 24 January.24 Jan. – S. Cadoc (with S.

It was thought to have been developed by the KBTM design bureau in Omsk in the late 1990s. A production version of this tank has never been publicly demonstrated. The Black Eagle has been cancelled, with all production and development halted. The company that was developing the tank, Omsktransmash, has gone bankrupt,Omsktransmash and its designs and projects have been absorbed into Uralvagonzavod and state owned services.Конструкторское бюро \\"Омсктрансмаша\\" станет филиалом \\"Уралвагонзавода\\" - Экскаватор РУ Uralvagonzavod was developing the T-95 in competition to the Black Eagle, and now owns the rights to both projects, but the Russian government has withdrawn all support and funding for the project.  Development  Development started during the 1980s, when the design bureau of the Leningrad Kirov Plant (LKZ) developed a new design based on the stretched T-80U chassis. Later, when the bureau closed, the documentation was transferred to KBTM in Omsk. A mock-up of the Black Eagle was first demonstrated at the VTTV arms exposition in Omsk, in September 1997, making a single brief pass, far from the reviewing stands. The tank appeared to be a standard T-80U hull, topped by a very large turret and gun, obscured by camouflage netting and canvas. The turret later turned out to be a crude mock-up. An early prototype was shown at an arms exposition in Siberia, in June 1999. This tank had an elongated hull with seven pairs of road wheels instead of the T-80's six, and a turret still mostly obscured by camouflage netting. The tank was based on a lengthened T-80U hull, with an extra pair of road wheels and a brand new turret. It appeared to have had very thick front armour and new-generation Kaktus explosive reactive armour on the hull and turret. The turret had a very large, box-shaped turret bustle instead of the traditional dome shape of previous Soviet and Russian main battle tanks. According to Russian reports, the Black Eagle design had abandoned the carousel-style autoloader in the fighting compartment for an autoloader mounted in the large western-style turret bustle, which incorporates a blow- out armoured ammunition compartment for crew safety, like the U.S. M1 Abrams, the German Leopard 2, British Challenger 2, French Leclerc and several other modern western tanks. The prototype had a 125 mm tank gun, but it was stated that it may have accommodated a larger 152 mm gunZaloga 2000, p 4. (compared to the 120 and 125 mm-calibre guns of main battle tanks in service). There was debate about whether the Black Eagle would incorporate the Drozd or Arena (countermeasure). =Cancellation= The Black Eagle project was formally cancelled in 2001. Development of the Black Eagle was stopped due to financial problems, questions about the reliability of the design and, most importantly, the terrible performance of the T-80, upon which it was modeled, in the first Chechen war. The T-80 performed so poorly that after the conflict General- Lieutenant A. Galkin, the head of the Armor Directorate, convinced the Minister of Defence to never again procure tanks with gas-turbine engines.Mikhail Zakharchuk, 'Uroki Chechenskogo krizisa' (Lessons of the Chechen crisis), Armeyskiy sbornik, April 1995 This included the Black Eagle, which was promptly cancelled. The manufacturers, Omsk Transmash, attempted to appeal the decision, but were unable to pursue the appeal after filing for bankruptcy in 2002. As of July 2008, the Russian army planned to adopt a new Uralvagonzavod tank after 2010, possibly designated T-95.Christopher F. Foss, “Russia's New MBT Tipped to Sport a 152 mm Gun”, Jane's Defence Weekly, July 30, 2008, p. 6. However, development of the T-95 tank was also cancelled, in May 2010.Neglecting the Navy could threaten Russia's sovereignty  Features & Opinion  RIA Novosti Colonel Vladimir Voitov, head of research at the Main Directorate of the Armored Troops, denied the existence of the tank in an interview with the Echo Moskvy radio in September 2009. \\"There was no such project...and those 20-year-old pictures show a mock-up of a futuristic tank which remained just a product of someone's imagination,\\" ... \\"the turret of the vehicle did not have anything inside.\\" It was announced that some technical solutions developed for the Black Eagle tank will be incorporated into the Armata Universal Combat Platform which is currently in production.

Platinum Fox took place on the Eastern Front and had the objective of capturing the Barents Sea port of Murmansk. It was part of a larger operation, called Operation Silver Fox (Silberfuchs; ). Background At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa German units of Army of Norway, commanded by Nikolaus von Falkenhorst, attacked from Norway to secure Petsamo at the Finnish-Soviet border as part of Operation Reindeer. They joined Finnish forces on the border of Soviet territory. These divisions consisted of elite mountain troops mostly from Austria specially trained to operate above the Arctic Circle. The Finnish-German forces launched Operation Silver Fox (Silberfuchs), attacking Murmansk from two directions. The assault from Finnish Petsamo directly towards the port of Murmansk was codenamed Platinum Fox (Platinfuchs). The other assault was an attack Kandalaksha from Salla and to isolate Murmansk from the south by cutting off the Murmansk railway. This concurrent operation was codenamed Operation Arctic Fox (Polarfuchs). Platinum Fox On 29 June 1941 the Platinum Fox phase of Silver Fox was launched. Mountain Corps Norway under the command of Generalleutnant Eduard Dietl, consisting of the German 2nd Mountain Division and German 3rd Mountain Division together with the Finnish Ivalo Border Guard Battalion crossed the border and advanced on Murmansk. They were opposed by units of the Soviet 14th Army, namely the 14th and 52nd Rifle Division, which were commanded by Valerian A. Frolov. After some initial successes the advance was slowed. The German offensive met with many problems from the start, as the rough terrain with bad roads made any advance difficult. The German units also lacked proper maps and had to move mostly through unknown terrain. The two divisions advanced in two directions. In the south the 3rd Mountain Division was able to penetrate the Soviet lines at the Titovka Valley in one day after fierce fighting and secured a bridge over the river. In the north the 2nd Mountain Division also made good progress in the first hours to secure the neck of the Rybachy Peninsula.Mann & Jörgensen (2002), p. 82. Nevertheless, the offensive soon met with heavy Soviet resistance, especially from some ad- hoc ground units of the Soviet Northern Fleet. The 2nd Mountain Division could not advance into the Rybachy Peninsula, and already at the start of July had to go into the defensive in this sector. Further south, after a heavy Soviet counterattack, the Germans resumed their offensive to the east to reach the Litsa River, with joint forces from both divisions. With the element of surprise lost, the Germans were only able to establish a small bridgehead over the river. After a heavy Soviet counterattack on 7 July, Dietl requested more reinforcements, but he received only a motorized machine-gun battalion from Norway. On 10 July a new plan had to be made, after a copy of the offensive plan fell into Soviet hands. The 2nd Mountain Division had to expand the bridgehead, while the 3rd Mountain Division had to advance on the south and establish another bridgehead. The renewed attack was again initially successful, but after the Soviets landed with two battalions on the other side of the Litsa Bay further north, Dietl had to stop the offensive. The situation now became worse for the Germans, as the thinly stretched forces had to hold a 57 km long frontline along the Litsa River to the Rybachy Peninsula. With the absence of roads, the supply situation also deteriorated and the offensive stalled. Dietl asked for more reinforcements and Hitler, after initially being reluctant, agreed to transfer the 6th Mountain Division from Greece to Dietl's command. After more arguing, in August the 388th Infantry Regiment and the 9th SS Regiment from Norway were also assigned to the operation.Mann & Jörgensen (2002), pp. 83–84. German coastal artillery – German shipping was under constant attack by Soviet-British forcesDietl now made plans to renew the offensive, with the fresh SS regiments leading the assault, in September before the onset of the winter would make it difficult to fight. But a combination of British and Soviet surface ships and aircraft, which constantly attacked German shipping to the northern ports, hampered the arrival of reinforcements and supplies and would delay the arrival of the 6th Mountain Division to October.Mann & Jörgensen (2002), p. 85. Nevertheless, on 8 September Dietl started with the renewed offensive without the 6th Mountain Division. The initial assault failed badly and the SS regiments, untrained for arctic warfare, took heavy casualties. The Germans made some initial progress, but a Soviet counterattack stopped the offensive soon after.Mann & Jörgensen (2002), pp. 85–86. Constant attacks by Soviet submarines and British surface ships (consisting of a force of two aircraft carriers, two cruisers and six destroyers) also sank numerous German ships and worsened the supply situation even more. For this reason von Falkenhorst prohibited German shipping from sailing east of the North Cape on 13 September.Mann & Jörgensen (2002), pp. 86–87. Hitler again pressured to continue the offensive, but Dietl made it clear, that with the dire supply situation and without further reinforcements no further advance was possible. On 19 September the Germans retreated from their bridgehead east of the Litsa river. More Soviet reinforcements arrived in the area and on 21 September the German offensive was broken off. Mountain Corps Norway was ordered to now defend the frontline and secure the Petsamo area and its nickel-mines, as a renewed offensive was ruled out. In mid- October the 2nd Mountain Division withdrew to Petsamo and the 6th Mountain Division replaced the 3rd Mountain Division along the Litsa line. The 3rd Mountain Division was then moved back to Germany in December. During the winter of 1941, the Soviets launched several heavy attacks on the Litsa as well as the Rybachy Peninsula front. The dug-in German units were able to hold it, cementing the front line for the next years. Conclusion Operation Platinum Fox was a German failure. Although Dietl was able to make some ground, his insufficient forces were soon stopped by the Soviets. The presence of British-Soviet naval forces at the Barents Sea hampered German efforts to adequately supply his forces and the general unwillingness of the German High Command to reinforce something which they considered as a secondary theater paved the way for the only successful Soviet resistance in the early stages of Operation Barbarossa. The failure of Platinum Fox had a significant impact on the course of the war in the east. Murmansk was a major base for the Soviet Northern fleet and it also was the destination of shipped Western Allied aid to the Soviet Union. With the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, the stream of supplies intensified even more through the Lend- Lease pact. A large part of this was delivered via the Northern route to the port of Murmansk, and the port of Arkhangelsk, contributing to its continued resistance.Mann & Jörgensen (2002), pp. 81–87. In recognition of its role in the successful defense of Murmansk, the Soviet 52nd Rifle Division was renamed 10th Guards Rifle Division on 26 December 1941.

Cover to Fantastic Four Annual #6. Art by Jack Kirby. Annihilus first encountered the Fantastic Four when they entered the Negative Zone seeking anti-particles needed to treat Sue's cosmic ray-related pregnancy complications. Annihilus's minions captured the heroes, but they escaped, stealing his Control Rod. They returned it after siphoning off the needed anti-particles and returned to Earth.Fantastic Four Annual #6 Annihilus was challenged by a research scientist, Janus the Nega-Man, who developed a module capable of harnessing antimatter energy within the Negative Zone. Annihilus defeated Janus, forcing the Nega-Man to lead him to Earth, but Janus was instead seemingly killed in the exploding atmosphere where matter meets antimatter.Fantastic Four #108-110 Annihilus nearly crossed over to Earth through one of Mister Fantastic's portals, but was driven back by the Avengers.Avengers #89 Annihilus battled the Frightful Four, and once again attempted to escape the Negative Zone, but was foiled by Spider-Man and the Human Torch.Marvel Team-Up #2 Sensing great power within Franklin Richards, Annihilus abducted him, along with the Fantastic Four, Medusa, Wyatt Wingfoot, and Agatha Harkness into the Negative Zone. He used a machine to prematurely release the child's full power potential, hoping to transfer the expended energies into himself. The Four defeated Annihilus and escaped back to Earth.Fantastic Four #140-141 Annihilus later allied with Mr Fantastic against the Mad Thinker.Fantastic Four #181-183 Blastaar, a fellow Negative Zone warlord, stole the Control Rod and left Annihilus to die.Marvel Two-in-One #75 Desperate, Annihilus tried to escape to Earth.

Annihilus was defeated by Thunderstrike.Thor #434-435 Soon after, Annihilus and Blastaar joined forces with fellow Negative Zone warlord Syphonn. During a confrontation with Adam Warlock, Annihilus and Blastaar betrayed Syphonn, allowing him to be defeated.Warlock vol 3 #1-4 (2000) Annihilus began leading the Annihilation Wave, an enormous fleet of Negative Zone battleships, ostensibly claiming to have the goal of conquering the universe. He claims that the universe is expanding into areas of the Negative Zone, making the universe now rightfully his territory. His forces destroy the Kyln, an intergalactic power station and maximum security prison, and the planet Xandar, headquarters of the Nova Corps.Annihilation: Prologue He allies with ThanosAnnihilation: Silver Surfer #2 and two beings that were trapped in the Kyln by Galactus, Tenebrous, and Aegis.Annihilation #1 Tenebrous and Aegis defeat Galactus and the Silver Surfer, and the two are connected to a giant mechanism in Annihilus' starship.Annihilation #1-2 Annihilus' goal is actually creating a massive Power Cosmic bomb that will destroy the Universe and the Negative Zone, leaving Annihilus the only survivor.Annihilation #4 Drax and the Silver Surfer manage to free Galactus, who destroys the Annihilation Wave. Nova battles and kills Annihilus.Annihilation #6 Annihilus was later reborn as an infant with all of the original's memories. During the War of Kings, the Negative Zone is invaded by Darkhawk and his ally Talon. They discover the infant Annihilus and his Cosmic Control Rod have been placed under the care of a lesser lord of the Negative Zone, Catastrophus. Catastrophus had been using the Cosmic Control Rod to stunt the development of the infant Annihilus, hoping to prolong his own rule. Talon slew Catastrophus and seized the Control Rod, before calling out to the infant Annihilus and asking it to remember in the future that he had spared the creature's life.War of Kings: Ascension #2 During a later incursion into the Negative Zone, Johnny Storm discovers that Annihilus's forces have been rebuilt to \\"pre-Crunch assault levels,\\" but are currently embroiled in a struggle with Blastaar's forces. Central to that struggle is a city built from the remains of the Negative Zone Prison Alpha. The war is further complicated by the involvement of the Universal Inhumans.Fantastic Four #578 The Human Torch dies stopping a horde of aliens from the Negative Zone.Fantastic Four vol 1 #587 (Jan 2011) Later, when Reed Richards opens a window to the Negative Zone and menaces Annihilus with the Ultimate Nullifier, Annihilus in return brandishes Johnny's uniform to Reed.Ching, Albert. \\"Associated Press Spoils FANTASTIC FOUR #587 Hours Before Comic Goes on Sale\\" , Newsarama, January 25, 2011Ching, Albert. \\"Hickman Details FANTASTIC FOUR #587's Big Character Death\\", Newsarama, 25 January 2011Moore, Matt. \\"After Half Century, It's 1 Fantastic's Farewell\\", Associated Press via ABC News, January 25, 2011. WebCitation archive.Fantastic Four #588 (Feb 2011) Annihilus uses regenerative surgery to revive the Human Torch, turning him into a gladiator when he refuses to reopen the portal from the Negative Zone.Fantastic Four #600 (2012) Annihilus is contacted by an alternative version of Reed Richards (one of the last survivors of the Council of Reeds) via the Cult of the Negative Zone, a religious movement worshipping Annihilus. As part of a plan to orchestrate an event known as the \\"War of Four Cities\\", Richards offers to open a massive portal between the Negative Zone and Earth, allowing the Annihilation Wave to pass through. Annihilus agrees, and sends forces to attack the Baxter Building and secure its Negative Zone gateway.Fantastic Four #601 (2012) Johnny Storm learns of the plan and enlists the Inhumans Light Brigade in an uprising, attacking Annihilus' forces as they prepare to cross over. With the aid of Light Brigade member Kal Blackbane, Johnny wrests the Cosmic Control Rod away from Annihilus, and takes control of the Annihilation Wave armada, using it to battle the Kree fleet as well as the Mad Celestials. Annihilus is captured and a leash is placed around his neck.Fantastic Four #602-605 (2012) After a rebellion breaks out for free elections in the Negative Zone, Annihilus wins as a write-in candidate for new leader of the Negative Zone, with 14,980,336,901,214 votes for him.FF #18 During the Infinity storyline, Annihilus appears as a member of the Galactic Council.Infinity #3 It is later revealed that Annihilus is still trapped in a child form, and has been using a mechanized stand-in for public appearances. Seeking to return to a more impressive size, he has his agents arrange the abduction of Bruce Banner. After his scientists study Banner's physiology and learn what allows him to transform into the Hulk, Annihilus is mutated into a gigantic, more monstrous form.Thanos vs. Hulk #1-4 With this new form, Annihilus and his army make another attempt to conquer the universe. They are successful, ravaging many worlds and killing most of Earth's heroes.Thanos: The Infinity Relativity However, with help from Above-All-Others, Thanos and Adam Warlock are able to travel back in time and prevent Annihilus' invasion from ever occurring. Warlock then uses his powers to devolve Annihilus into a primitive insect, which is then stepped on by Thanos.Thanos: The Infinity Finale Annihilus, now back to a more standard form, later begins kidnapping and enslaving shipwreck survivors on a desolate world. Using the Nega-Bands to open a portal out of the Negative Zone, Annihilus plots to destroy Earth and the rest of the universe by using a powerful energy cannon. However, he is thwarted by the All-New, All-Different Avengers, who are able to steal the Nega-Bands and destroy the weapon.All-New, All-Different Avengers #10-12 Powers and abilities Annihilus is capable of self-propelled flight and can withstand the vacuum of space. He wears \\"armor\\"—actually an insectoid exoskeleton with some armored components—that grants him resistance to most forms of injury (extreme temperatures, ballistic force, bullets, etc.) He has superhuman physical abilities. He is able to breathe in the vacuum of empty space, and his wings can carry him at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. Annihilus wields the Cosmic Control Rod, a weapon of great power. It allows him to manipulate cosmic energy in order to control the molecular structure of matter. The rod is capable of projecting vast amounts of destructive energy and concussive force. Continuous exposure to the cosmic energies of the rod has also retarded the aging process of its wielder, making Annihilus virtually immortal. Though not always engaging himself in direct combat, Annihilus has proved to be a very formidable opponent, and was able to defeat the Thing,Fantastic Four Vol. 1 #108 (1971) Thor, Nova Prime, Quasar, and BlastaarFantastic Four Vol. 1 #290 (1986) in individual fights with relative ease. Annihilus also sometimes wields energy pistols based on Tyannan technology that he has modified. In Annihilation: Nova, Annihilus killed Quasar, and gained his Quantum Bands, adding to Annihilus's power.Annihilation: Nova #4 (Sept. 2006) By using these in combination with most of his stored power reserves Annihilus was able to withstand a massive blast from Galactus in the Annihilation series. While the blast destroyed his entire army, along with several solar systems, Annihilus was able to survive.Annihilation #6 (2007) He also leads an elite personal guard, the Centurions, 200 superpowered aliens, each from a different Negative Zone world. They are extremely loyal to him and form a devastatingly effective army. Fantastic Four #600 reveals that Annihilus is always reborn upon death, as he was at the conclusion of the Annihilation miniseries. This is described by Annihilus as \\"endless resurrection . . . can't stop living.\\"Fantastic Four #600  Other versions  Age of Apocalypse = When the mutant known as Legion traveled back in time to kill his father's long time nemesis Magneto to prevent Xavier from dealing with years of conflict, so Charles could be a true father to him, Legion failed and accidentally killed Xavier instead.X-Men (2nd series) # 41 With the battle between Legion and a team of X-Men sent back in time to stop him seen worldwide on television, mutants were revealed for the first time a full decade before they were seen in the normal Marvel Universe. Apocalypse made the decision to move up his quest for the creation of a world in his image: a world where mutants ruled and Survival of the Fittest was the only law. X-Men: Alpha one-shot In this harsh world, the X-Man known as Blink would travel to the Negative Zone where she met Ahmyor, a freedom fighter native to the Negative Zone who joined the rebellion against their malicious leader, Blastaar. The two would exchange fists rather than greetings at first, though the battle would end in a stalemate. Once Ahmyor realized she meant him no harm, the two called a truce and he began to explain to her his situation. The people wanted to restore control to their previous ruler, Annihilus, who was also malevolent, but the lesser of two evils in this case. For some time, Ahmyor had been haunted by visions of their tortured leader Annihilus who had been made undone in his quest for order through domination. He could feel his gnawing need for power, the endless struggle that drove him to madness, but blue-clad interlopers called the Fantastic Four would inevitably see to his end.Blink #2 Despite not having any memories of herself, the girl found the spirit of rebellion to be a familiar one and joined his cause. Over the course of a week, Ahmyor would fall in love with this angel. She made him extremely happy as both a warrior and as a man and helped restore his soul. Eventually, the couple was captured and taken to Blastaar who revealed that Ahmyor was actually Annihilus. Blink felt betrayed as she believed she had done the honorable thing by aiding in a rebellion, but it appeared that she was only helping a dictator reclaim his empire. Ahmyor explained that he was amnesiac just like Blink was and had no recollection of his former life. When he was removed from power, he regressed to an earlier, humanoid stage in his being. However, his knowledge of the truth caused him to begin reverting into his insectoid form.Blink #3 Blastaar had previously acquired the Annihilation Cannon, a deadly invention made by Annihilus that could not be fired without the Cosmic Control Rod joined to the form of its creator. With Ahmyor/Annihilus now in his clutches, Blastaar finally had the key to active this ultimate weapon and he planned on using it to destroy Earth. Suddenly, Blink with a renewed dedication to her beloved and found him bound to the Annihilation Cannon. She moved quickly to free him, but discovered that the device had been altered so that it would explode if Annihilus was removed from it. Ahmyor's transformation into Annihilus was nearly complete and he urged her to leave him and the Negative Zone as he was no longer the man she loved. With tears in her eyes, Blink teleported Ahmyor away, sent the Annihilation Cannon to Blastaar's position, and teleported herself back home where the X-Men had been frantically searching for her. Subsequently, Annihilus was once again himself. An image fluttered across his mind's eye, causing him to pause, and giving him a moment's worth of peace. It was an image of the only being ever to reach him, the only one he ever loved. However, it faded just as quickly as it had come and was replaced with rage that burned in his heart as thoughts of revenge boiled within him.Blink #4 = Mangaverse = In the Marvel Mangaverse, Annihilus is a gigantic, monster that attacks the Earth in order to destroy it. He is confronted and defeated by the Fantastic Four.Marvel Mangaverse vol 2 =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Fantastic Four encountered an Annihilus-like creature in their first foray into the N-Zone. Translating machines implanted in the Four's space suits dubbed the creature Nihil, though Nihil himself stated this is a caste title and not his proper name. Nihil ruled over a space station composed of the fused remains of several alien space ships. It orbited near a dying red dwarf star for warmth because the whole N-Zone is experiencing entropic decay.Ultimate Fantastic Four #15 Like Annihilus, Nihil and his caste are from a species that can live over a million years. Not wanting to die before he is supposed to naturally, when Nihil learned that the UFF were from a different, younger universe he engineered a plan to escape and kill them. Johnny Storm, who for the entire trip had been experiencing discomfort, fell ill and was rushed by Sue back to their ship. Reed Richards and Ben Grimm went along with her but once they returned to tell Nihil of their situation Nihil revealed his intention to steal their ship, named by Johnny as the Awesome, and go to Earth. He exploded his translation devices, thereby rupturing Reed and Ben's space suits and exposing them to the N-Zone's highly acidic atmosphere. Nihil then sent his previously unseen soldiers to kill them but Reed sealed his damaged suit by covering his shattered face mask with his hand, and Ben discovered his lungs filter out poisons, enabling him to battle Nihil.Ultimate Fantastic Four #17 In the ensuing fight, Ben ripped Nihil's right wing off, most of Nihil's soldiers were beaten by the enslaved alien refugees living on the space station, and Ben and Reed escaped to the Awesome. Nihil then launched a bioship after the UFF when they were racing back to Earth. Nihil's flagship managed to make it through but both ships crashed on to the Las Vegas Strip. Another battle started between Nihil and the Fantastic Four. During it, Johnny Storm emerged from the Awesome, discovering that he would periodically enter hibernation and shed his dead skin cells so that his powers would regenerate, and then entered the fight. At the climax of the battle, Nihil pinned Reed to the ground and opened his jaws to consume him, but Reed, stating that he was better than Nihil because he could adapt and Nihil just wanted to rule, stretched and jammed a plasma emitting weapon into Nihil's mouth. Nihil tried to pry the rod out by the trigger and his head was subsequently blown up. Nihil is at this time presumed dead and his body is most likely in government possession. Many of Nihil's soldiers survived and they were presumably captured if not killed. The lasting effect of this battle is that the Fantastic Four's secrecy was blown and the team had to be given a formal introduction to the world.Ultimate Fantastic Four #18 In other mediaTelevision= * Annihilus appeared in a cameo in Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends.

In 2012, Wolverine World Wide added Saucony, Keds, Stride Rite and Sperry Top- Sider to its list of brands, after acquiring the Performance Lifestyle Group of Collective Brands in a $1.23 billion transaction that also involved the sale of Payless ShoeSource and Collective Licensing International to private equity firms Blum Capital Partners and Golden Gate Capital.  History  Founding and early years (1883 to 1959) = G. A. Krause and Fredrick Hirth founded the company in 1883. Fredrick Hirth and Mr. Krause bought a small leather shop in Grand Rapids, Michigan, starting with a capital investment of $2,900. In 1901, they decided to build a plant in Rockford Michigan, just north of Grand Rapids. They purchased and expanded the Rogue River Electric Light and Power Company to power their new plant and the city of Rockford. In 1903, operations began and in 1908, a tannery followed. The company now processed its own raw materials and manufactured its own shoes sold through the Hirth-Krause Company. In 1921, the company changed its name to Wolverine Shoe and Tanning Corporation. From 1916-1923, its earnings increased 700%. In 1941, during World War II, the Wolverine Shoe and Tanning Company began to work for the U.S. Navy, developing pigskin gloves and inventing what later became known as pigskin suede.{cndate=May 2020}} = Name change and expansion (1960 to 1989) = In 1964, the company changed its name to Wolverine World Wide, Inc. and in 1965 became a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Hush Puppies, a casual footwear brand founded by the company in 1958, quickly rose to popularity in the 1960s. = Growth and Acquisitions (1990 to 2009) = Caterpillar-branded work boots manufactured by Wolverine World Wide In 1994, Wolverine World Wide introduced Cat Footwear, a licensed brand of shoes using the Caterpillar Inc. name. In 1995, the Council of Fashion Designers of America voted Hush Puppies as Fashion Accessory of the Year. In 1997, the company continued expanding by purchasing the Merrell brand. In 1998 Wolverine World Wide acquired the global license for footwear from the Harley-Davidson Motor Company. Wolverine World Wide acquisitions in the 2000s included the 2003 purchase of Sebago and 2009 purchases of Chaco and the UK-based brand Cushe. The company discontinued the Cushe brand in 2015 and sold Sebago to Italian publicly-traded company BasicNet in 2017. In 2006 Wolverine World Wide entered into a global footwear licensing deal with Patagonia. The company stopped production of Patagonia footwear in 2014. = Present day = Wolverine World Wide nearly doubled in size after its 2012 acquisition of the Performance Lifestyle Group of Collective Brands, which added Saucony, Keds, Stride Rite and Sperry Top-Sider brands to its portfolio. In 2017 the company sold its United States Department of Defense footwear business along with a factory in Big Rapids, Michigan to Tennessee-based footwear manufacturer Original Footwear. In the same year Wolverine World Wide converted Stride Rite to a licensed brand operated by New York City-based Vida Shoes International. The company is based out of corporate offices in Rockford, Michigan and Waltham, Massachusetts. Wolverine World Wide also operates three distribution centers in the U.S., one in Canada and one in the Netherlands. As of December 29, 2018, Wolverine World Wide operated 80 retail stores in the U.S. and Canada and 42 consumer-direct eCommerce sites. According to the company's 2018 annual report, \\"substantially all of the units sourced by the Company are procured from numerous third-party manufacturers in the Asia Pacific region. The Company maintains offices in the Asia Pacific region to develop and facilitate sourcing strategies.\\" Wolverine World Wide had various PFAs dumpsites throughout Belmont and Rockford that contaminated the drinking water of residents. These sites contaminated the water for hundreds of residents. The chemicals involved have been linked to various negative health effects, including cancer. mlive.com In 2019, Wolverine World Wide reorganized into two operating segments: * Wolverine Michigan Group whose brands include Bates, Cat footwear, Chaco, Harley- Davidson footwear, Hush Puppies, HyTest, Merrell and Wolverine * Wolverine Boston Group whose brands include Keds, Saucony, Sperry Top-Sider, the Stride Rite licensed business and the kids footwear businesses of Cat, Hush Puppies, Keds, Merrell, Saucony and Sperry  References  External links  * Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Manufacturing companies based in Michigan Category:Companies based in Kent County, Michigan Category:1883 establishments in Michigan Category:Clothing companies established in 1883 Category:Shoe companies of the United States ","title":"Wolverine World Wide"},{"id":"2005022","text":"The Ukrainian Riding Horse () or Ukrainian Saddle Horse is a modern Ukrainian breed of warmblood sport horse. Breeding began in the years after the Second World War at the stud farm of Dnipropetrovsk in central Ukraine – at that time in the USSR – and later expanded to three other state stud farms. It derives from cross-breeding of Hanoverian, Thoroughbred and Trakehner stallions with local mares or with Hungarian Furioso, Gidran Arab or Nonius mares. It incorporates the last bloodlines of the extinct Orlov-Rostopchin or Russian Saddle Horse. It was bred to compete in show jumping, three-day eventing and dressage, but is also suitable as a general riding horse.  History  Breeding of the Ukrainian Saddle Horse began in the years after the Second World War at the stud farm of Dnipropetrovsk, in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in central Ukraine, which at that time was part of the Soviet Union. Breeding was based principally on cross-breeding of Hanoverian, Thoroughbred and Trakehner stallions with mares of local or of Hungarian Furioso, Gidran Arab or Nonius stock, but also incorporated the last bloodlines of the extinct Orlov- Rostopchin or Russian Saddle Horse. Breeding expanded to three other state stud farms: the Oleksandriysky stud at in Oleksandriia Raion of Kirovohrad Oblast in central Ukraine: the Provalsky stud at in Sverdlovsk Raion of Luhansk Oblast in the easternmost part of Ukraine; and the Skadovsky stud at Bilozerka in Kherson Oblast in the south of the country. When these were closed, breeding continued at Dnipropetrovsk, and some horses were moved to the historic at , in Bilovodsk Raion of Luhansk Oblast, and to the at Yahilnytsia in Chortkiv Raion of Ternopil Oblast in the western part of the country. From 1975 breeding was also carried out at the Lozivsky stud farm at , in Lozivsky Raion of Kharkiv Oblast in eastern Ukraine. There are seven lines within the breed, of which the Bespechny is closest to the extinct Orlov-Rostopchin breed. A stud-book was begun in 1971. The breed received the official approval of the State Committee for Food and Procurement of the Council of Ministers of the USSR in 1990, not long before the break-up of the Soviet Union and the independence of Ukraine. In 2004 there were 1393 horses registered, distributed among 5 state stud farms and 20 breeders in 13 of the oblasts of Ukraine; of these, 84 were stallions. This represented about 23% of the total purebred horse population of the country, and was slightly lower than the numbers of the Russian Trotter, the most numerous breed.  Characteristics  The Ukrainian Riding Horse is muscular and solidly built, with high withers, a broad deep chest, a long straight back, a long sloping croup and strong legs well set on. The head is well proportioned, with a straight profile.  Use  The Ukrainian Riding Horse has been bred to compete in show jumping, three-day eventing and dressage. It is also suitable as a general riding horse.

It parodies the plays of William Shakespeare with all of them being performed in comically shortened or merged form by only three actors. Typically, the actors use their real names and play themselves rather than specific characters. The fourth wall is nonexistent in the performance, with the actors speaking directly to the audience during much of the play, and some scenes involve audience participation. The director and stage crew may also be directly involved in the performance and become characters themselves. The script contains many humorous footnotes on the text that are often not included in the performance. However, improvisation plays an important role and it is normal for the actors to deviate from the script and have spontaneous conversations about the material with each other or the audience. It is also common for them to make references to pop culture or to talk about local people and places in the area where the play is being performed. As a result, performances differ, even with the same cast. History The writers, Long, Singer, and Winfield--former founding members of the Reduced Shakespeare Company--first performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1987 and later played at the Criterion Theatre in London, where it ran for nine years. It has become one of the world's most popular shows, playing frequently in a variety of languages. It is notable for holding the world record for the shortest-ever performance of Hamlet, clocking in at 43 seconds, as well as the fastest performance of Hamlet backwards, at 42 seconds. Synopsis The three actors first introduce themselves to the audience, the first actor (Daniel Singer) reminding the audience not to record the show, the second (Jess Winfield) giving a speech about how unappreciated William Shakespeare is and the third (Adam Long) giving a biography of Shakespeare mixed up with a biography of Adolf Hitler. They begin with a parody of Romeo and Juliet. Next, they do a parody of Titus Andronicus, portraying it as a cooking show. Following it is Othello, which is done through a rap song. The rest of the first act demonstrates most of the other plays. All the comedies are combined into one convoluted reading (the justification being that they all recycle the same plot devices anyway). All the histories are acted out through an American football game with the British Crown as the football (or as a soccer match in at least one German production or an Australian Rules football game in an Australian production). Julius Caesar is reduced to his death, followed immediately by a reduction of Antony and Cleopatra, and a reduction of Macbeth to one duel while explaining all about ketchup and mustard and other elements (witches, Macbeth's downfall, etc.) in poor Scottish accents. There is also a failed attempt at scholarly discussion of the Shakespeare Apocrypha. At the end of the act, the characters realise that they forgot to perform Coriolanus which Adam refuses to do due to the vulgarity of the title, and Hamlet, Shakespeare's greatest work. Adam becomes nervous and petulant about performing such a famous and difficult play, so he runs around the theatre and then out the door with Jess chasing him. Daniel is left alone to improvise before calling for intermission. After the intermission, Jess and Adam return, saving Daniel from having to cover the sonnets by writing them down on a 3x5 card and passing it around the audience. Adam is convinced to continue with the performance. The entire second act is the performance of Hamlet. The audience gets involved during this segment when one audience member is asked to portray Ophelia for the Nunnery Scene. The rest of the audience makes up Ophelia's subconscious, with three sections that each represent her ego, superego, and id. After the portrayal of Hamlet, the actors play it out several times increasing their speed of delivery. They finish by performing it backwards.

The location is depicted in various publications from Marvel, most frequently in Fantastic Four and Captain Marvel. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, it first appeared in Fantastic Four #51 (June 1966). Fictional description The Negative Zone in the Marvel Universe is used as a fictional dimension. Essentially, it is a universe parallel to Earth's. The two have many similarities, but a few noteworthy differences include: all matter in the Negative Zone is negatively charged; the Negative Zone is entirely filled with a pressurized, breathable atmosphere; and near the center of the Negative Zone is a deadly vortex of unspeakable power. Since the Negative Zone is largely uninhabited, several would-be conquerors have attempted to bridge the gap to Earth and take over its population. A few notable residents of the Negative Zone include Blastaar, Annihilus, Stygorr and Noktiis. The Negative Zone is often visited by the Fantastic Four as Mister Fantastic discovered it, and has mapped portions of it extensively. The Age of Apocalypse version of Blink also visited it once, which proved that there's only one Negative Zone, as Annihilus remembered the Fantastic Four even though they never existed in the Age of Apocalypse. For a number of years, Captain Mar-Vell and Rick Jones were bonded to each other, causing one of them to exist in the Negative Zone while the other would exist in the regular universe. They exchanged places by clasping the special bracelets each wore or automatically after a few hours. Spider-Man has also visited the Negative Zone, and acquired a costume that allowed him to merge with shadows and become practically invisible. When he was framed by Norman Osborn a few weeks later, he used the costume to become the dark, mysterious Dusk (one of his four new superhero identities during the Identity Crisis story arc). A few months later after Spider-Man's name was cleared, Cassie St. Commons was given the guise of Dusk and joined the Slingers. Cletus Kasady also visited the Negative Zone, finding an exact replica of the Carnage symbiote there, the original one which he had lost when Venom absorbed it into his own symbiote. History The earliest origins of the Negative Zone and its culture have not been revealed, but rough estimates place its height of science and art over 1.5 million years ago, nearly coinciding with the rise of the Skrull and Kree races. It is believed that around that time the Negative Zone began \\"the Big Crunch\\", ceasing expansive progress and contracting to a central nexus. Some of the most powerful and influential races faced destruction and sought to preserve their lives. One of the more aggressive races at this time were the Tyannans. The lion-like bipeds explored much of the Negative Zone, and eventually began to seed many of the planets, including Baluur, with their \\"spores of life\\". However, their final mission went awry. A debris field had begun forming around Tyanna, which was at the very heart of the Negative Zone. The Big Crunch had begun pulling the universe back towards its center and planets crumbled under the increased pressure. One of the last remaining Tyannan ships careened off a large chunk of rock and crashed on the desolate planet of Arthros. The ship's engines dead and food processors destroyed, the Tyannan captain ordered the release of their life spores. Life slowly began to evolve on the planet, much as it did on Earth. Farther from the core of the Negative Zone, other cultures thrived. One culture had gone so far as to cover half of their planet with a giant city, and then developed an artificial brain for it. The city, Ootah, even began to develop a sense of self-preservation and drove the inhabitants out of its boundaries, building up greater defenses to prevent them from returning. Farther still from the core, the world of Kestor also flourished. It was the first recorded world beyond Tyanna that faced obliteration at the hands of the Big Crunch, roughly 10,000 years ago. Unlike Tyanna, whose gravitational force became greater than could sustain life, Kestor's sun was pulled toward the nexus. This caused the planet's several moons to shift their respective orbits and wreak havoc on the planet itself. As 20,000 beings left Kestor in a great space ark, the sun exploded with the fury of a supernova, substantially damaging their ship. All but 500 of the crew died and the navigational systems were destroyed, eliminating all hope of finding a new planet to call home. One of the planets the Tyannans spored, Baluur, developed in a more barbarous manner. The inhabitants grew very large and powerful, and even the meek among them were stronger than an ordinary human. While they did progress technologically, their advances were at least partially driven by war. But they apparently began to experience the effects of the Big Crunch and several millennia ago they took their cities underneath the planet's surface. A sole entrance exists and is known only to the Baluurians themselves. They established a quiet monarchy and became very reclusive, only venturing into space on rare occasions. Sentient life eventually developed on Arthros. A lone insect-like creature emerged from the primordial marsh one thousand years ago, and began to reason. A frail creature, he used his superior intellect to avoid larger predators and soon stumbled upon the Tyannan's derelict ship. Inside the craft, he donned a helmet in an attempt to warm himself. The helmet in fact had recordings of all the Tyannan technology and culture, and the creature was able to deftly assimilate all of it. He took the power from discarded life canisters and created a Cosmic Control Rod, capable of granting the wielder great power. Taking the name Annihilus, he set out to not only right those who wronged him, but to ensure that no one should ever harm him again. While Annihilus forcibly took control of his immediate sector of space, a king rose to prominence on Baluur. Blastaar was a ruthless and powerful leader who sought to expand Baluurian domain. The other Baluurians feared him and were eventually able to depose him by sedating him heavily and sending him to what they hoped would be his destruction in the center of the Negative Zone. =Discovery= While searching for a way to travel through sub-space, Reed Richards stumbled upon a gateway to the Negative Zone.Fantastic Four Volume 1, Annual #6 He spent a fair amount of time studying it through probes, and determined that it was largely unpopulated. So much so, in fact, that he—and others—used the Negative Zone on several occasions to get rid of difficult enemies, such as the Mad Thinker's android, the Super-Adaptoid,\\"Fantastic Four\\" Volume 1, #71 and even Galactus. Reed and the Fantastic Four have since done more detailed explorations of the Zone and no longer use it to dispose of villains. For some time, the Norse realm of Asgard was lost in the Negative Zone.New Mutants Vol 1 #86 (Feb. 1990) =Civil War= In the Super-Hero Civil War, a group of heroes led by Iron Man, Mister Fantastic and Yellowjacket have created a massive prison in the Negative Zone (similar to the Vault) to house captured non-registering heroes as they wait for their trials. It is designated Negative Zone Prison Alpha but nicknamed Fantasy Island by inmates. Tony Stark himself named it \\"Project 42\\", as it had been the 42nd idea out of a hundred that he, Reed Richards and Hank Pym had created following the Stamford Disaster. There are portals to it planned for every single state so prisoners can be transported there by the different teams in the Fifty State Initiative- including one at Ryker's Island. It is very clean, with sanitation, but extremely heavily guarded, including password-changes every ten minutes. Its most notable former inmates were Iron Fist (posing as Daredevil at the time), Cloak and Dagger, Speedball, Prodigy and Prowler. It is also the setting for the final battle of the super hero civil war, as Iron Man lays a trap for Captain America but the Captain retaliates by using his planted mole, Hulkling, to release all the prisoners of 42 who come to his aid. Though in the ensuing battle Cloak manages to teleport all its superhuman detainees out, it remains as a prison for villains such as Lady Deathstrike and Taskmaster. (Taskmaster was later released to become the trainer for new Initiative recruits and Deathstrike seemingly escapes to assist in the Purifiers crusade during the Messiah Complex.) It also holds many of the Sakaaran forces from World War Hulk. In the one-shot Civil War: The Return, the Prison's warden was revealed as the first Captain Marvel, apparently back from the dead. Although he was later revealed as a Skrull sleeper agent named Khn'nr, whose conditioning was so strong he kept believing he was the Captain even after he had realized he really was not. =Secret Invasion= In the Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four limited series, the Skrull warrior Lyja (posing as Susan Richards) sends the Baxter Building into the Negative Zone. She reveals herself to Johnny Storm (her former spouse) and attacks him, feeling angry that he had forgotten her. During the course of their battle, Johnny saves Lyja from being hit by a police car, pulled in through the portal. The two reconcile after that, but a Negative Zone creature attacks them. They manage to defeat the creature, but Lyja passes out from her injuries. A bit later, when the \\"new\\" Fantastic Four fly off to the prison, Franklin and Valeria are grabbed by Negative Zone creatures, but Lyja saves them. Later when Ben, Johnny, Franklin, Val and the Tinkerer are ready to leave the Negative Zone she refuses to leave, because she wants to find out who she is.Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four #1-3 =War of Kings= After the events of Secret Invasion, the inmates of the prison took control of the facility after their correction officers abandoned the prison. Blastaar later overrun the prison during the prelude to the War of Kings story arc.Guardians of the Galaxy #10 =Cataclysm= The Negative Zone is used to dispose of Earth-616's Galactus when he is accidentally transferred to the Ultimate Marvel universe due to the temporal distortions caused by the events of Age of Ultron. The heroes of the Ultimate Marvel universe reasoned that Galactus will starve to death in the Negative Zone because it is a universe made of antimatter and Galactus would not have anything to eat there.Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand #5 =Annihilation: Scourge= The Negative Zone is later visited by the Sentry, who is struggling to understand his new state of self and find a way to separate himself from the Void.Annihilation - Scourge: Fantastic Four #1 Upon soaking up the negative cosmic rays, the Sentry is able to separated himself from the Void but is left in the powerless form of Bob Reynolds. The Void was then drawn to the Cancerverse realm, where nothing could die, and impersonating and taking on the appearance of the Sentry, the Void became the new leader of its forces.Annihilation - Scourge: Silver Surfer #1 He then led them back to the Negative Zone, forcing longtime enemies Blastaar and Annihilus to team up against them to prevent the Negative Zone kingdoms from being ravaged by the Undying Ones. Lead by the Revengers, an ever-growing army of zombie-esque drones slaughter and infect their way from world to world giving no quarter as they leave destruction in their wake. As their desperate attempt to defend their domain fails, both rulers discover in the process that the Void is planning to conquer the Negative Zone and its denizens before returning to his own universe to spread the Cancerverse's infection even further.Annihilation - Scourge: Alpha #1 Annihilus then crosses into the positive matter universe to seek assistance, only to land right in the lap of Richard Ryder the last Nova, however, the past trauma at the hands of the Cancerverse, caused Ryder to flee, leaving Annihilus at the mercy of his enemies.Annihilation - Scourge: Nova #1 The Void then attempt to cross over into the positive Universe, but was stopped by Beta Ray Bill and Lockjaw, with Beta Ray Bill forced to sacrifice his magical hammer, Stormbreaker, in the process.Annihilation - Scourge: Beta Ray Bill #1 Unique featuresThe Crossroads of Infinity= Initially, it was generally believed that getting caught in the gravitational pull of the vortex at the center of the Zone meant certain death. However, some theorized that if one could survive entry into the vortex, one could travel to another dimension. However, this was only a theory until Doctor Doom gambled the lives of the Fantastic Four to prove it. Once inside the so-called Crossroads, individuals flip through a series of other parallel dimensions while progressing through. Coming to a halt seems to stabilize the Crossroads and then allows movement in the universe arrived in. However, it still remains a risky trip for a number of reasons. First and foremost is the expenditure of energy necessary to keep from imploding. On one occasion, it required the use of both Annihilus' Cosmic Control Rod and the Invisible Woman's force field to stave off death. Second, and almost equally important, is the lack of control one has while passing through different dimensions. Even with the precise calculations of Dr. Doom, it required several hops to reach the dimension he sought. Staying on a straight course to the very heart of the Crossroads leads one to Tyanna. Although it was believed to have been destroyed centuries earlier, the Tyannans' technology proved capable of sustaining them within the center of the vortex. Using their advanced machines, they were able to modify their bodies to exist safely in the immense pressures, but at the cost of being forced to remain hidden within the Crossroads. The Tyannans remain there, content to pursue their scientific interests. =The Distortion Area= Normally beings enter the Negative Zone through the Distortion Area. This is an invisible sphere of energy that resides in the Negative Zone but is accessible from many parts of Earth. By hitting the field with a precise wavelength of energy, a rift opens between both dimensions connected by the Distortion Area. This area acts as a buffer between the two polar opposite universes and alters a traveler's own polarity so that they may exist in the other dimension without harm. When activated, the Distortion Area appears from the outside as a crackling energy source roughly six feet in circumference. This effect only lasts as long as the field is activated and, once closed, becomes invisible again. Nearby matter is sucked into the near-vacuum of the Distortion Area and \\"falls\\" for about 50 seconds before emerging on the other side. The Distortion Area itself is nothing short of indescribable. Humans cannot begin to accurately fathom or record what transpires within the Distortion Area and travelers' minds try to compensate with a bizarre display of light and color. Combined with the natural turbulence in the area, many find the trip rather nauseating. Like any other mode of transport, choosing where to enter the Distortion Area in part affects where an individual is deposited on the other side. Reed Richards' former lab in the Baxter Building, for example, deposited someone at the outskirts of the Debris Field near Arthros. A rift opened on Yancy Street, however, dropped a traveler on the planet Tarsuu. Other methods may be employed to reach the Negative Zone but, while they tend to be more spatially accurate, they are very difficult to come by. Generally, this mode of transport is reserved by extremely powerful entities like Thor, the Supreme Intelligence, Galactus and the Watchers. Captain Mar-Vell's Nega-Bands could also transport the wearer to the Negative Zone but the precise destination was dependent upon the location of the Nega- Band's counterparts worn by Rick Jones. =Emotions= One of the rather undocumented side-effects the Negative Zone has on people seems to involve bringing forth what are usually considered negative emotions. At this point, it is difficult to determine the cause of this unusual phenomenon, but a number of dealings with the Negative Zone have given the impression that something inherent within it can lead to emotional distress. The severity of this distress can vary greatly. On a few occasions, it has manifested itself as a citywide panic. Other times, it merely caused a single person to temporarily lose their hope. Still other times, it caused several individuals to experience emotionally charged flashbacks, pulled from their subconscious. And, although it could be attributed to his psyche, Annihilus' main motivation is an obsessive fear of death. Not all inhabitants of the Negative Zone experience anything beyond normal anxieties, but the number of known instances of unusual psychological distress seems rather high. Visitors to the Zone may or may not experience anything emotionally disturbing. While there is no concrete evidence to show the correlation the Negative Zone has with emotional discord, it remains a significant feature of the region. =Life= As mentioned previously, the Negative Zone was originally thought to be largely uninhabited. Though this is now known to be incorrect, life having arisen on a number of its planets, the Zone is still mostly unoccupied space. Most of the encounters heroes have had with the Negative Zone revolve around Annihilus and/or Blastaar. Curiously, for as little life as there exists in the Negative Zone, it is very capable of supporting life. There, outer space itself is permeated with an oxygen-rich atmosphere, closely approximating Earth's. Consequently, humans can exist peacefully in space without the need for cumbersome pressure suits or oxygen masks. It is perhaps an issue of gravitational pull that is one of the biggest hindrances to life in the Negative Zone. While all objects of reasonably sized mass (planets, moons, asteroids, etc.) obviously have their own gravitational pull, it is weak enough to be overcome with minimal effort. Most heroes with flight capabilities can escape a planet's gravitational field with ease, as can any machine with the capacity for flight. Because of this lowered gravity, it is believed that vegetation has difficulty seeding properly, giving life a tenuous foothold at best on any given planet. Moisture also seems to be an issue in the dearth of life in the Negative Zone. While each planet has hardly been explored in full, many of the ones studied—including those that are inhabited—have shown few, if any, natural water sources. Most planets appear to be very arid, with cultures adapting to the lack of moisture much as was done on Earth's deserts. =Time= Being a different dimension with different laws of physics, time flows differently in the Negative Zone than it does on Earth. Although a comprehensive analysis has never been completed, preliminary findings suggest that two weeks pass in the Negative Zone for every hour on Earth, making a 336:1 ratio. On a smaller scale, every minute on Earth is a little over five and half hours in the Negative Zone. It seems, however, that this ratio changes as one approaches the center of the Negative Zone. Since there have been several instances of pan-dimensional conversations between the two planes, it appears the time ratio is much closer to 1:1 when one is at the nexus of the Negative Zone. It is currently unclear at what rate the time difference increases as one moves away from the vortex or if there is an upper limit to how great the difference between the two universes can become. =Planets= The Negative Zone includes the following planets: * Argor – A planet that is home to the Argorans. * Arthros – A planet that is home to Annihilus and the Arthosians (a race of insectoids). * Baluur – A planet that is home to Blastaar. * Kestor – A planet that was destroyed causing the Kestorians to become nomads. * Tarsuu – * Tyanna – A planet that is home to the Tyannans (a race of lion-like aliens). Tyanna is located at the Crossroads of Infinity. The Tyannan scientists genetically engineered a spore that could be scattered over an uninhabited planet's surface where they can grow into new plants and animals. This terraforming made the planet habitable. Other versions In the Blink miniseries, it is established that there is in fact only one Negative Zone in the multiverse of Marvel Universe, with exit points to different realities and timelines, as the Blink from the Age of Apocalypse found herself in a Negative Zone that still remembered the Fantastic Four's role in defeating Annihilus despite the fact that the team never existed in her world.Blink #2 This goes along with the Mutant X Universe, where Havok tried to get back from the Mutant X-verse to the main Marvel earth by a detour through the Negative Zone.Mutant X #25 Additionally both Rikki Barnes and Onslaught traveled from the Pocket Universe of Heroes Reborn to the mainstream Marvel Universe through the Negative Zone.Onslaught Reborn #5Onslaught Unleashed #1 During the Cataclysm event it is again established that there is in fact only one Negative Zone in the multiverse of Marvel Universe, with exit points to different realities and timelines, as the Ultimate Marvel heroes, after a brief trip to Earth-616 to acquire local information on Galactus,Cataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand #3. Marvel Comics. 2014 eventually manage to send Galactus to the Negative Zone, reasoning that he will eventually starve to death because Negative Zone is made of anti- matterCataclysm: The Ultimates' Last Stand #5. Marvel Comics. 2014, however, following an incident on Earth 616 where the Eternal known as Ikaris is brainwashed by a Kree device called the God's Whisper, the Eternals retrieve, with help from Aarkus, the comatose Galactus from the Negative Zone, and state that they plan to use the God's Whisper to unleash him upon the Kree when he awakens as revenge for what they did to Ikaris.All-New Invaders #5. =Ultimate Marvel (The N-Zone)= The Ultimate Marvel equivalent of the Negative Zone was originally called the N-Zone. A zone that exists directly below the Ultimate Marvel universe. It is tied to the powers granted to the Fantastic Four and is the homeplace of the Ultimate Fantastic Four villain Nihil. The N-Zone is a universe in the later stages of entropic heat death, with less than a million years of existence left to it. There are few stars still burning, mostly long-lived red dwarf stars, and despite the advanced technology of many races, life barely maintains a toehold on its existence.

It is served by the Watford DC line on the London Overground network. It is the only station on the line's sole deviation from the West Coast Main Line. History Watford High Street was served by Silverlink trains 1997-2007 A London Overground train arriving at Watford High Street The station was opened by the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway (W&RR;) on 1 October 1862, with services running from to . In 1912 a branch was opened to . The line came under the ownership of London and North Western Railway (LNWR), which was absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, following the grouping of Britain's railway companies. Additional rail services were introduced to Watford High Street; on 16 April 1917 the Underground Electric Railways Company of London extended its Bakerloo line through this station to , and in 1922 the LNWR completed the suburban Camden to Watford Junction New Line, linking Watford High Street to via the Watford DC Line (shared with the Bakerloo line). After nationalisation in 1948, the Watford DC Line was run by British Rail (from 1986 under its Network SouthEast brand). At the height of operation around the 1950s, Watford High Street was served by the Bakerloo line, and by British Rail trains on both the Croxley Green and Rickmansworth branches, a local all-stations service to Euston and another local service to via . Over the years, most of these services were gradually withdrawn. The Rickmansworth branch was a poorly used service and passenger services were terminated by BR in 1952. Croxley Green services continued as Parliamentary trains until the line closed fully in 1996. On 24 September 1982, London Transport cut back the Bakerloo line to run only as far north as (reinstating the service as far as in 1984). London Broad Street station was closed in 1986 and trains on the Primrose Hill route were diverted to until 1992, when passenger services on the Primrose Hill line were withdrawn completely. After the withdrawal of the Croxley, Bakerloo and Broad Street routes, the only remaining service running from Watford High Street was British Rail's Watford DC Line to Euston. Following the privatisation of British Rail the franchise for the Watford DC Line was taken over by National Express who ran the line under its Silverlink Metro name. In 2007 the line was brought under the control of Transport for London, who today operate it as part of the London Overground network; this service uses the 750 V DC lines for its all-stations local service with the 4th rail presently redundant except as part of the electrical return circuit. Croxley rail link map In 2011, a project to extend the London Underground's Metropolitan line to Watford Junction was announced. The planned Croxley Rail Link would have diverted the Metropolitan line branch across the town along a reinstated stretch of disused track of the former Watford and Rickmansworth Railway; the link would then have joined the Watford DC Line just south of Watford High Street, and Underground trains would have shared track with London Overground through to Watford Junction. The scheme was cancelled in 2018 due to funding difficulties. Location Map of railways around Watford town centre Watford High Street station is located in the Lower High Street in Watford town centre. In the immediate vicinity around the station are a number of retail and civic amenities including the Watford Museum, containing a gallery of fine art and displays of local heritage, and the intu Watford Shopping Centre (also known as the Harlequin Centre), the largest shopping centre in Hertfordshire, which attracts more than 17 million customers each year. Various other shopping parks are also close to the station, including a large Tesco Extra, Waterfields Shopping Park (containing large stores such as Sports Direct and Next), as well as many stores situated on the High Street. Watford town centre has many popular bars and clubs, such as PRYZM; the only producing theatre in Hertfordshire, the Watford Palace Theatre; as well as numerous restaurants and cafes, both chain and independent. To the east of the railway line is the site of Benskins Brewery, the office building for which is now Watford Museum. The brewery was rail-served by sidings until 1956. The station is situated in a deep cutting covered by a single platform canopy. The roof of the canopy is connected to the concrete sided cutting by ornamental metal trusses.

He won a national championship in his final season at Marquette, and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992. He was also well known as a longtime national television basketball broadcaster and for his colorful personality. Early life McGuire played three years of basketball at St. John's Prep, Brooklyn, New York (graduated 1947), and went on to star at St. John's University (1947–1951), where he played for four years and captained the 1951 team that posted a mark and finished third in the NIT. NBA career After college, McGuire played in the NBA, first with the New York Knicks (1951–53) and then with the Baltimore Bullets (1954). While with the Knicks, he once famously pleaded with his coach for playing time, with this guarantee: \\"I can stop Cousy.\\" Inserted into the lineup, McGuire proceeded to foul him on his next six trips down the court. Coaching career McGuire began his coaching career as an assistant at Dartmouth College (1955–1957) for head coach Doggie Julian. McGuire coached the freshman team at Dartmouth. One of his players was Dave Gavitt. McGuire then took his first head coaching job at Belmont Abbey College (1957–1964), in Belmont, North Carolina, where he recruited many high school players off the streets of New York. McGuire became head coach at Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1964 where he enjoyed success, including the NIT Championship in 1970 and a Final Four appearance in 1974 against the North Carolina State Wolfpack, where McGuire became the first coach ejected from a championship With assistant coaches Hank Raymonds (who would succeed him) and Rick Majerus, who became a successful college head coach, McGuire led Marquette to its only NCAA basketball championship in 1977, his final season as a head coach. McGuire's Marquette team, led by Alfred \\"Butch\\" Lee, Maurice \\"Bo\\" Ellis and Jerome Whitehead, defeated Dean Smith's North Carolina Tar Heels for the title, two days after Whitehead received a full-court pass and subsequently made a last-second shot, propelling Marquette past UNC Charlotte in the national semifinals. Ranked sixteenth, Marquette had seven losses going into the NCAA tournament, the most losses up to that time for a team that would win the NCAA Championship. The thrilling weekend in Atlanta's Omni Coliseum provided a happy sendoff. While at Marquette, McGuire founded \\"Al's Run,\\" a charity event for the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. The race celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2017. Business career On December 17, 1976, McGuire stunned fans by announcing that he would retire as coach after the end of the current season, to become vice chairman of Medalist Industries, effective May 1, 1977; he had served on its board of directors of the sporting goods firm for six years. McGuire was an executive with the company less than a year, resigning on March 20, 1978. Broadcasting career After coaching, McGuire became a popular commentator for NBC Sports and CBS Sports. McGuire's on-air banter with colleague Billy Packer helped increase the popularity of college basketball across the United States. McGuire was courtside for the landmark 1979 championship game between Indiana State and Michigan State that pitted Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, which is remembered as a game that vastly enhanced the appeal of college basketball. Reflecting on the event ten years later, McGuire said that the 1979 title game in Salt Lake City \\"put college basketball on its afterburner.\\" That national championship game remains the highest-rated NCAA Final broadcast. Death After a long bout with leukemia, McGuire died at age 72 in 2001 in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Legacy The Al McGuire Center, which includes a statue in his honor, opened on the Marquette campus in 2004. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1993. McGuire's brother Dick (Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee 1993) was also a prominent figure in basketball, having starred at St. John's and then with the New York Knicks of the NBA. Dick and Al both played for the Knicks. They are the only pair of brothers, and one of only two sibling pairs (the other being Cheryl and Reggie Miller), inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Others in the Hall of Fame Class of '92 included Lou Carnesecca, Phil Woolpert, Jack Ramsay, Connie Hawkins, Bob Lanier, Sergei Belov, Nera D. White and Lusia Harris Steward. McGuire is not related to the late North Carolina and South Carolina coach Frank McGuire. Al and Frank coached against each other when Frank was head man at South Carolina. Al played for Frank at St. John's. Frank McGuire has been considered Al's coaching mentor. McGuire was survived by his wife, Patricia, three children, sons Allie (who played for his father at Marquette) and Rob and daughter Noreen, and six grandchildren. Play Al McGuire's former television broadcast partner and friend, Dick Enberg, penned a one-man theatrical play entitled Coach portrayed by actor Cotter Smith. It debuted at Marquette University's Helfaer Theater in 2005, and returned there by popular demand in 2006. The play was then presented at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta during the 2007 Final Four Championship, at Hofstra University in February 2008, and at the North Coast Repertory in San Diego County in April 2008. It returned to North Coast Rep by popular demand in August 2008, and subsequently was seen at Central Michigan University, Dick Enberg's alma mater on October 10, 2008. A benefit performance for the San Diego Chargers was presented on November 12, 2008. From January - June, 2017, the play entitled \\"McGuire\\" was presented by the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, starring Tony Award winner Anthony Crivello. That run broke all box office records for the space, playing to 'sold-out' houses in the 150 seat Stackner Cabaret. Crivello received critical praise for his work in the show, and won 2017 Wisconsin Footlights Award for \\"Outstanding Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play.\\" A five- minute presentation of the show was presented at the 2017 Wisconsin Sports Award on May 20, 2017, at the University Of Wisconsin Field House. The audience included All-Pro Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers, All-Pro Green Bay Packers LT David Bahktieri and noted sports figures including Green Bay Packers players Jason Spriggs, Kyle Murphy, former Packer player Mark Tauscher, Milwaukee Brewers player Jonathan Villar, Milwaukee Bucks player Jabari Parker, UW Head Women's Basketball Coach Jonathan Tsipis, former University of Wisconsin Milwaukee Head Men's Basketball Coach and current Butler Head coach Lavall Jordan, Marquette University Head Men's Basketball Coach Steve Wojceichowski, UW Head Men's Basketball Coach Greg Gard, executives and broadcasters Bill \\"Rock\\" Schroeder, Steve \\"The Homer\\" True, Tim Van Vooren from ESPN, FOX Sports Wisconsin, Major League Baseball, Good Karma Broadcasting founder Milwaukee's ESPN Radio owner Craig Karmazin, top male and female athletes from Wisconsin, Marquette University, UW Green Bay, UW Milwaukee, Marquette University Athletic Director Bill Scholl, Wisconsin Women's Volleyball HOF 2017 Athlete Of The Year Lauren Carlini, Wisconsin Men's Basketball players including Zack Showalter, Athletic Director/ NCAA HOF Former Head Football Coach Barry Alvarez.

The shot was the first three-pointer of Forrest's collegiate career in the first game McGuire broadcast for CBS. * Following his broadcast of a 1996 NCAA Regional Championship, McGuire garnered fame for dancing with the players of Syracuse who were celebrating their entry into the Final Four. He would do the same the following year with the players from the University of Minnesota.

When Dick Enberg joined CBS Sports in 2000 after a long career with NBC, McGuire was able to be reunited with Enberg and longtime CBS commentator Billy Packer. On Feb. 5, 2000, the trio called its final game together when Michigan State easily defeated UCONN 85-66. It was the first game the trio had called in nineteen year when Indiana defeated North Carolina for the 1981 NCAA National Championship game for NBC.

It can settle clear grounds, with a faster growth than the other Chilean podocarpaceae. It is a medium to large tree, growing to around , exceptionally to . The bark peels off in papery flakes, with a purplish to golden brown hue. The sharp, green needle-like leaves are stiff and leathery, 2 cm long. The cones are highly modified with 2-4 fused, fleshy berry-like juicy scales, bright red when mature, bearing one (rarely two) rounded seeds at the apex of the scales. In a classic example species-pair of the Antarctic flora, it is very closely related to Podocarpus totara from New Zealand, to the extent that if planted together, they are very difficult to distinguish. The best distinction is the slightly brighter green tone of the leaves, compared to the more greyish-green of P. totara.  Cultivation and uses  The wood is hard and straight grained and very resistant to rot, it is yellow with reddish marks, semi-heavy, semi-hard and resistant to decay. but due to scarcity is little used. Podocarpus nubigenus is occasionally grown as an ornamental tree in the western British Isles and the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it receives the cool summers and high rainfall it requires for successful growth.

Developed by Imagineering, it was published by Acclaim Entertainment in North America and Europe in 1991. The game was released in Japan in 1993. In Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly, the player controls Bart from the television series The Simpsons as he escapes from an unpleasant summer camp run by ruthless counselors. The plot is similar to that of The Simpsons episode \\"Kamp Krusty\\". Critics gave the game mixed to negative reviews. Plot and gameplay Bart and Lisa go to spend the summer at a camp, which proves to be the dangerous Camp Deadly run by Mr. Burns's nephew, Ironfist Burns. His intentions are to make sure that the children suffer and have as little fun as possible. In the first stage of the game, Bart and the other children play capture the flag in a forest, as part of the camp's morning activity. Bart is harassed by camp counselors and bullies Blindside Bill and Rebound Rodney, and must make his way through nests of angry bees and other obstacles. The second stage takes place during lunch break at the mess hall, where the counselors throw knives and forks at Bart. Another game of capture the flag follows in the next stage as the afternoon activity. While playing, Bart must avoid counselors, bullies, killer hornets and traps set out for the escaped madman Mort. The fourth stage is dinner break and is the same as the lunch break stage. Later that day, Bart and Lisa decide to escape from Camp Deadly, both because it is too dangerous and because they cannot stand it anymore. However, Ironfist Burns overhears their plans. At night, in the next stage, they escape by climbing to the other side of a mountain called Mount Deadly. The game's final stage takes place in a forest on the other side. Partway through, Lisa is kidnapped, and Bart later finds her at a power station with Ironfist Burns. Bart defeats him and frees Lisa. Together, they find and flip a switch at the station that shuts off the power at Camp Deadly and puts an end to their stay there. Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly is a side-scrolling 2D platform game. It is single-player-only, and the player controls Bart. Lisa's role in the stages is giving Bart boomerangs to use against the various enemies. His default weapon is spit wads, and in the cafeteria stages, the barely edible food offered at the camp. Development and release The game was developed by Imagineering and published by Acclaim. It was released in 1991 in North America and Europe for the hand-held console Game Boy. The game was released in Japan on February 26, 1993. It was the first Simpsons game to be released on a portable console. The plot of Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly bears a strong similarity to the Simpsons episode \\"Kamp Krusty\\" in the sense that they both revolve around Bart and Lisa staying at an evil summer camp. However, that episode did not air until 1992, a year after the game was released. Reception Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly has received mixed to negative reviews. Nintendo Power gave it a 3.4/5 rating in 1991. UGO Networks gave the game a negative review, commenting that \\"this uninspired train wreck of a Game Boy title fails on nearly every level, but most of all simply because it's a snore-fest. It's your basic side-scrolling platformer with little to no connection to the source material and lasts only about few hours at best. During the game you come across bullies, camp counselors and even a few wild animals, battling them with spitballs, a boomerang and, in the lunchroom level, food. This one is for completists only.\\" Matt Williamson of the Rocky Mountain News gave the game a C+ grade and commented that \\"Escape from Camp Deadly tries too hard to be a Nintendo game. It's hard, I know, to try to make game graphics more primitive, but please, guys, the more complex you make the graphics, the more confusing a game gets!\\" However, the Channel 4 video game programme GamesMaster gave the game an 89% rating. In 2009, 1UP.com editor Bob Mackey reviewed the game in 1UP's official Retro Gaming Blog. He wrote: \\"Camp Deadly drops the limited adventure elements of Bart Vs. the Space Mutants in exchange for some much simpler platforming with vastly improved controls [...]. The simple jumping and shooting is nothing to write home about, but Camp Deadly would have at least been a semi-competent early Game Boy game if not for the interminable waves of enemies it constantly throws at you. Here we see a common problem with Game Boy titles: the developers were clearly designing Camp Deadly with a big-screen mindset. Enemies teleport in from the edge of the screen and, given how little space there is to actually maneuver, you sometimes have less than a second to react.\\" ReferencesExternal links * *Title at Gamefaqs Category:1991 video games Category:Acclaim Entertainment games Category:Game Boy games Category:Game Boy-only games Category:Imagineering (company) games Category:Platform games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Video games based on The Simpsons Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by Mark Van Hecke ","title":"Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly"},{"id":"2005083","text":"The Amber Room is a complete chamber decoration of amber panels backed with gold leaf and mirrors in Tsarskoye Selo, Russia.

It was the first English-language Canadian feature film to win an award at the Cannes Film Festival. Plot Polly (Sheila McCarthy), is a worker for a temporary secretarial agency. Polly serves as the narrator for the film, and there are frequent sequences portraying her whimsical fantasies. Polly lives alone, seems to have no friends and enjoys solitary bicycle rides to undertake her hobby of photography. Despite her clumsiness, lack of education, social awkwardness and inclination to take others' statements literally, all of which have resulted in scarce employment opportunities, Polly is placed as a secretary in a private art gallery owned by Gabrielle (Paule Baillargeon). Ann-Marie MacDonald plays Mary, who is Gabrielle's former young lover, and also a painter. Mary returns after an absence, and she and Gabrielle rekindle their former relationship despite Gabrielle's misgivings that she is too old and Mary too young. Polly, who's fallen a little bit in love with Gabrielle, is inspired to submit some of her own photographs anonymously to the gallery. She is crushed when Gabrielle dismisses her photos out of hand and calls them \\"simpleminded\\". Polly temporarily quits the gallery, and goes into a depression. She returns to the gallery, and revives a little when Mary notices one of her photos. All the while, Mary and Gabrielle have been perpetrating a fraud. Gabrielle has been passing off Mary's work as her own. When Polly finds out, she becomes livid and tosses a cup of tea at Gabrielle. Believing she has done something unforgivable, Polly retreats to her flat in anguish. Mary and Gabrielle later visit Polly at her flat, and realize that the discarded photographs were by Polly. As the film ends, Gabrielle and Mary look at more of Polly's photographs and in a short fantasy sequence the three are transported together to an idyllic wooded glen, a metaphor for the beautiful world that supposedly plain and unnoticed people like Polly inhabit. Cast * Sheila McCarthy as Polly Vandersma * Paule Baillargeon as Gabrielle St. Peres * Ann-Marie MacDonald as Mary Joseph * Richard Monette as Clive * John Evans as Warren * Brenda Kamino as waitress Production Producers Rozema and Alexandra Raffé had never directed or produced a feature film prior to their work on Mermaids, although they worked together on a previous short film. =Development= Rozema was working as an assistant producer on The Journal, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation current affairs television show, when she started to write film scripts in 1983. Her earliest works were all rejected by funding agencies. During this time period, she also took a five-week class on 16 mm film production at Ryerson University in Toronto. In 1985, she got financial backing for her first short film, Passion: A Letter in 16 mm, which was released later in 1985. Although Passions won a Silver Plaque at the 1985 Chicago International Film Festival, it also received a very harsh review in The Globe and Mail. The negative criticism of Passion and the personal rejection felt by Rozema compelled her to make Mermaids with its strong anti-authority motif \\"which examines the merciless negative judgments of the Toronto elitist high art milieu\\". Rozema began writing Mermaids while working as a third assistant director on David Cronenberg's film The Fly. The Mermaids script began with the creation of the lead character Polly. Rozema circulated the first draft to friends in the Toronto arts community, including actress and writer Ann-Marie MacDonald who was later cast in the film as the character Mary Joseph. Through the writing process, the film's working title changed from Polly to Polly's Progress to Polly's Interior Mind. When the script was submitted for grant funding in June 1986, the title was Oh, the Things I've Seen. The final version of the film's title is taken from the poem The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot. It was the second film playing on the film festival circuit in 1987 that had a title taken from the same Eliot poem, following Eat the Peach (1986). Mermaids was originally conceived as an hour-long television film, but it timed out at 65 minutes. Rather than cut the script, Rozema was advised by Debbie Nightingale from the then-new Ontario Film Development Corporation to expand the script by at least 15 minutes so it could be eligible for OFDC feature film funds. =Funding and budget= Rozema and Raffé approached several funding agencies for financial backing for Mermaids. The first to grant them funds was the Ontario Film Development Corporation, due primarily to the steady support of Nightingale. The producers knew they also needed support from Telefilm Canada in order for the project to come to fruition, but at the time Telefilm had a reputation for being \\"philosophically averse to low-budget, auteur-driven films\\". The Telefilm administrator at the time, Peter Pearson, reportedly stomped out of a meeting declaring that Telefilm \\"should not be financing these kind of minimalist, student films\\". After many weeks of discussions, the agency finally agreed to fund the film after Rozema and Raffé brought on experienced film producer Don Haig in the role of executive producer who worked on the film for a modest fee of CAD$7,000. Also important to Telefilm's eventual funding was a contract with film distribution company Cinephile, which agreed to a CAD$5,000 guarantee, representing the absolute minimum required by the funding agency. The final agreements with Telefilm were not completed until Fall 1986, by which time the filming was already completed. In the interim, producer Raffé had taken a bank overdraft of $25,000 to complete the shooting and to help cover her and Rozema's living expenses. The final funding sources for the film were: * Ontario Film Development Corporation * Telefilm Canada * Canada Council * Ontario Arts Council * National Film Board of Canada, which contributed editing facilities The film's budget details vary by source. In her book about the film, scholar Julia Mendenhall wrote that the film had a budget of CAD$362,000; one article in the Toronto Star said the budget was CAD$350,000 plus another $40K to blow up the negative from 16 mm to 35 mm; a different Star article stated the budget was CAD$325,000. American newspapers also reported different budgets for the film. A San Francisco Chronicle article says the budget was US$273,000 which translated into CAD$350,000; an article in a Fort Lauderdale, Florida newspaper says the budget was US$262,000, which was the same amount cited in a New York Times film review. The newspaper USA Today reported the budget as less than US$300,000. All sources agreed that the film qualified as low- budget. =Pre-production= Rozema says she and Raffé worked in pre- production full-time between February 1986 and September 23, 1986. For their financing applications, the producers named their company Vos Productions. Vos means \\"fox\\" in Dutch and was Rozema's mother's maiden name. Casting Independent casting director Maria Armstrong was hired by Rozema with a casting budget of only CAD$500 to help identify the actors for Mermaids. Armstrong submitted a list of six or seven names of actresses for the role of Polly, including Sheila McCarthy. It took several readings before Rozema decided to hire McCarthy. In the director's commentary on the DVD, Rozema said about the casting of McCarthy: \\"When she came into the audition, I thought 'oh, pleeease be able to act.' She looked so unbelievably perfect, like a little bird just hatched. Almost asexual with these gigantic, sympathetic eyes. And … a kind of sweetness of manner that seemed just so right.\\" Unlike McCarthy, who was unknown to Rozema prior to the making of the film, the director was already a friend of actress Ann-Marie MacDonald but Rozema still required her to audition for the role of Mary Joseph. =Filming= Mermaids was shot in Toronto between September 24 and October 24, 1986. After principal filming was completed, Rozema, McCarthy and the first assistant director filmed additional location shots around Toronto for four or five days. The film was shot in 16mm in both color and black-and-white, and was later enlarged to 35mm. Shooting originally in 35mm was never seriously considered due to the higher costs of using that film stock. The filming of Polly's fantasy flying scene was accomplished with a $60 special effect. =Post- production= Rozema was the film's editor, performing that work from the end of 1986 through the beginning of 1987. The National Film Board of Canada allowed her to use their editing studios free of charge. Later, the NFB offered to pay for the consulting services of professional editor Ron Sanders, which Rozema readily accepted. In the director's commentary, Rozema said that because the film had such a small budget, she didn't have the luxury of multiple takes of many scenes. Most of the filmed footage was included in the final version of the film. By mid-January 1987, Rozema had a rough cut version of the film ready to show to the funding agencies. Following a rough cut screening of the film in February 1987, Cinephile president Andre Bennett suggested that the film be entered in the Directors' Fortnight program at the Cannes Film Festival. Rozema initially rejected that idea because she didn't think the film was ready, as it was in the final stages of sound editing and still had to be mixed. But after some positive reviews of these screenings, Rozema decided to submit the film to a selection committee that met in March 1987. By the time Mermaids was selected for screening at Cannes, Rozema and her crew had less than six weeks to complete the film. After the film was selected for Cannes, the producers needed to secure funding for enlarging the film to 35mm. They approached Telefilm twice but were rejected both times. Telefilm suggested that Rozema contact Jan Rofekamp for this funding, as his company Films Transit had already acquired foreign sales rights to the film and could deduct the approximately $40,000 cost of the enlargement from foreign sales revenue. Rofekamp agreed. Rofekamp also generated the marketing plan for the film's premiere at Cannes. Tasks included compiling a press kit, creating promotional posters and other materials, translating the script into French, creating a print with French subtitles, and placing advertisements in trade publications. Rozema originated the concept for the film's poster, envisioning a René Magritte-like photograph of Sheila McCarthy's head floating over a body of water. She hired Toronto graphic artist Robbie Goulden to create the final product, with promises of payment if the film made a profit. The photograph of McCarthy used in the poster was a family picture taken by McCarthy's father. Eighty percent of all buyers of the film used the same image in their advertising, and it was used on the cover of both the American and Canadian DVD releases. Music The original plan was for singer- songwriter Jane Siberry to provide the voicings of the mermaids. But Siberry had a cold on the day those recordings were scheduled to take place, so her backing vocalist Rebecca Jenkins substituted instead. The musical score was composed by Mark Korven, who had only two weeks to complete the work. The film's musical arranger was John Switzer, who was also Jane Siberry's bassist. During the initial depiction of one of Polly's visions, the \\"Flower Duet\\" aria from Léo Delibes' opera Lakmé is heard as background music; portions of this aria are heard multiple times throughout the film. Near the end of the film, Polly has a vision of conducting a small orchestra, performing selections from Ludwig van Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. ReleaseCannes premiere= I've Heard the Mermaids Singing made its world premiere on May 10, 1987 at the Cannes Film Festival, as part of the Directors' Fortnight program. At the conclusion of the screening, two thousand audience members gave the film a six-minute standing ovation. Four additional screenings of the film were added to the Cannes schedule, and all sold out. The film almost wasn't screened at Cannes. When Pierre-Henri Deleau, the programmer for the Directors' Fortnight, received the film he mistakenly thought it was three hours long and would not preview it. A technician later discovered the film was less than 90 minutes, so Deleau watched it, liked what he saw, and invited Rozema to the festival. Some distribution deals had been made prior to Cannes, but Rozema and Raffé had intentionally not sold the U.S. rights before the world premiere. After the film's selection for Cannes was announced in Variety, the producers received numerous calls from American distributors who wanted private previews, but those requests were turned down. Raffé said of that decision \\"We decided we wouldn't screen it for anybody. You would see it in the theatre with a big audience, and we would either win big or lose big.\\" Following the successful Cannes premiere, the producers negotiated the sale of American distribution rights. At least seven American companies vied for the rights, including Orion Classics, Spectrafilm, and the eventual winner of the bidding war Miramax, represented at Cannes by Harvey Weinstein and Mark Silverman. Weinstein initially offered US$100,000 for the U.S. rights, but Raffé and Rozema rejected that offer and several subsequent ones from Miramax until they finally settled on US$350,000, which was the biggest number the producers could think of, as it represented the film's production budget. By the end of the Cannes Film Festival, Rofekamp, Rozema and Raffé had negotiated sales to 32 countries including France, Germany, and the U.K. as well smaller countries such as Norway, Greece, Singapore, and South Africa. Rofekamp and the producers had earned advances on royalties worth $1.1 million, which made the film commercially successful before it was released. =Other premieres= The first post-Cannes film festival showing was in Portugal at the Figueira da Foz Film Festival on September 7, 1987. The film made its Canadian premiere at the Festival of Festivals (now the Toronto International Film Festival) on September 10, 1987, and was honored by being screened at the festival's opening night gala, following upon the successful Cannes premiere. The United States premiere and first theatrical screening took place on September 11, 1987 at the 68th Street Playhouse in New York City. =Film festival screenings= Mermaids was invited to 32 film festivals, including festivals in Moscow, Munich, Hong Kong, Jerusalem and Mexico. Specific film festival screenings included: * Cannes Film Festival (10 May 1987) * Figueira da Foz Film Festival (7 September 1987) * Festival of Festivals (10 September 1987) * Boston Film Festival (17 and 20 September 1987) * Telluride Film Festival (September 1987) * Vancouver International Film Festival (16 October 1987) * London Film Festival (19 November 1987) * Istanbul Film Festival (April 1988) * Adelaide Film Event (July 1988) * Brno Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (16 November 2002) Critical responseMainstream media reception= Reviews of the film in mainstream media following the Cannes premiere through its run in theaters were mixed, with some male reviewers initially less enthusiastic about the film than female reviewers. As time passed, the reviews became more positive. The entertainment trade magazine Variety was given a private screening of the film in Toronto on 30 April 1987. Their official review, published on 20 May 1987 was very positive, stating that Mermaids is \\"an off- beat, power-packed first feature … bursting with confidence, with Rozema in full control in all capacities nearly every step of the way…. It has an obvious active life in the art market, on the fest circuit, and in subsequent tv and video playoff.\\" However, in Vincent Canby's review in The New York Times, the critic wrote that watching the film \\"is like being cornered by a whimsical, 500-pound elf\\" and that it \\"takes itself more seriously than the screenplay warrants\\". Richard Corliss wrote in Time magazine that the film is \\"a fairy tale for feminist pre-teens\\" and said Rozema was working \\"entirely too hard to be ingratiating; her picture is a desperate audition for endearment\\". A male reviewer from the Daily News of Los Angeles gave the film a grade of C, stating that the film is \\"basically a student work, and not a particularly good student work at that. It's not film making, it's film musing.\\" The reviewer went on to say the film represents \\"feminism with a smile face\\". A San Francisco Chronicle article about the film described it as \\"a Cinderella story of major proportions\\". A review by Rita Kempley in The Washington Post said the film is \\"rough around the edges, brimming with uncontrolled talent and confiding as a close friend. And like its protagonist Polly Vandersma, it is not as simple-minded as it first seems, for under all the whimsy, an allegory hides.\\" Film critic Molly Haskell wrote in Vogue magazine that the film was a \\"smashing commercial directorial debut\\" and described it as \\"a feminist fairy tale masquerading as a satire\\". An article by Graham Fuller in The Guardian stated that the film \\"is one of the outstanding directorial debuts of the year\\". In a December 1987 review, Bob Thomas from the Associated Press wrote that Rozema's \\"vivid and surprising imagination, coupled with a startingly original performance by Sheila McCarthy, help make the film a rare and unexpected delight\\". In his March 1988 review of the film, critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, and wrote that director Rozema \\"uses a seemingly simple style to make some quiet and deep observations\\". Ebert also described Sheila McCarthy's performance as \\"extraordinary\\" and said \\"she has one of those faces that speaks volumes, and she is able to be sad without being depressing, funny without being a clown\\". As of May 2020, 100% of the 11 critical reviews compiled by Rotten Tomatoes are positive, with an average score of 7.9 out of 10. The film has no scores collected by Metacritic as of 2020. =Feminist analysis and criticism= Canadian film scholar Thomas Waugh described Rozema as \\"the most prominent of English Canadian lesbian filmmakers\\". In identifying a feminist approach to this film and understanding Rozema's artistic intentions, Rozema says in an interview from 1991 that she refuses to define her work as \\"distinctly feminist\\" and emphasizes that \\"gender is a category that does not interest her\\". However, in 1993, Rozema claimed that her films assume feminism, concluding that \\"it's in their foundation\\". In Rozema's cinematic work, the main characters are predominantly women, in heterosexual or lesbian relationships, or single. Several of her film features portray or touch upon lesbian love, a theme quite apparently shown in Mermaids. The critic Camille Paglia praised the film's \\"wonderful comedy and realism\\", commenting on the character Polly, \\"This girl's kind of aimless, yet plucky. It's the twentysomething problem with self-definition.\\" A November 1987 review of the film in the feminist newspaper Sojourner said that Mermaids \\"is a film that could only be made by a woman. It strikes deeply at the heart of women's experiences in a way that even serious and compassionate male directors never do.\\" The review continues with \\"this film focuses on different kinds of love between women\\". Yet within some gay and alternative media coverage, there was criticism that the film glossed over the lesbian relationship between two of the characters, as well as complaints that Rozema had made a \\"decision not to make a public declaration of her sexuality in interviews with the world press after Cannes\\". In a September 1987 article about the film in the American newspaper Gay Community News, contributor Loie Hayes wrote \\"Why, when I love Patricia Rozema's film just as it is, why do I cringe when she says it's not 'about lesbianism'?\\" Hayes went on to describe the film as \\"an ambitious and thoroughly entertaining treatise on creativity and commercial success; it's an 'anti-authority' film with the nerd winning over the admiration of the elegant, rich, power-turkey\\". In October 1987, Canadian journalist and lesbian activist Chris Bearchell wrote in a review of Mermaids that \\"Even if fairy tales sometimes come true, it seems that a truly dyke tale, fanciful or otherwise, will have to wait for an out-of-the-closet dyke to write it\\". The first essay on Mermaids in a prominent academic journal by a highly credentialed feminist film scholar was written by Teresa de Lauretis in 1990. In her Screen article, de Lauretis \\"applied a political rubric that she called 'alternative women's cinema', and Mermaids failed her test\\". De Lauretis wrote that the recognition of Mermaids as \\"an exemplary film of women's cinema is ground for serious self-questioning by those of us who still want to claim the term for a feminist political project\\". In her book about the film, scholar Julia Mendenhall claims that the de Lauretis article in Screen was the start of \\"the great divide in scholarly criticism\\" on Mermaids, although Mendenhall sided with the more positive reception of the film, writing: Box office According to Box Office Mojo, I've Heard the Mermaids Singing earned US$25,998 in its first weekend, playing in only one theater. Its widest release in the United States during its theatrical run was in 27 theaters, and this source said the film earned a total of $1,408,491 in the US. For the beginning of its theatrical run in New York City, the distributor took out a full page advertisement in The New York Times, at a cost of US$25,000. After its first two weeks playing in New York, the film had earned more than $70,000. The New York theatrical release led to a successful national roll-out, with the film eventually screening in approximately 50 American cities. It performed best in locations with dedicated art film audiences. Co-producer Raffé claimed that the film grossed about $2.5 million in the United States, despite Miramax's \\"inscrutable bookkeeping methods\\". The Box Office Mojo entry for the film includes no data from non-US markets. In Canada, the film earned a total of CAN$264,965 at the box office, and by May 1992 had earned $644,000 including box office, television, and home video receipts. It played in most major Canadian cities, including a three-month run in Ottawa. However, the film was not shown theatrically in Patricia Rozema's hometown of Sarnia, Ontario because there were no independent cinemas in the small city. According to Raffé, the film grossed over CAD$10M in worldwide receipts, earning more than twenty-five times its production costs. Awards and honors I've Heard the Mermaids Singing won seventeen awards worldwide by the end of its run at film festivals and theatrical release, including: * Cannes Film Festival, 1987: Prix de la Jeunesse [youth prize] (Directors' Fortnight), awarded to Patricia Rozema * Genie Award, 1988: Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, awarded to Sheila McCarthy * Genie Award, 1988: Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role, awarded to Paule Baillargeon In addition, the film garnered the following honors: * In 1993, the Toronto International Film Festival ranked the film ninth in its list of the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time, with Rozema becoming the first female director to have a film on the list. The film did not appear on the updated 2004 or 2015 versions of the list. * Named a Top Ten Canadian Film of the 20th Century * Named as one of the Top 25 Films That Changed Our Lives by the Outfest Film Festival * Named as one of the Top Ten Canadian Feature Film Debuts Since 1968, in a poll conducted by the Canadian Film Centre * Included in a 10-week festival of New Canadian Cinema, aired in late 1989 on the United Kingdom's Channel 4 television network Home media Mermaids was first released on VHS tape in Canada by Norstar Home Video.

It was first released on DVD in the United States by Miramax Home Entertainment in 2000 and in Canada by Alliance Atlantis in 2002. Both DVD releases include a director's commentary by Patricia Rozema. The US DVD also contains other special features including a theatrical trailer, biographies, and a photo gallery. The film has also been released on VHS tape and DVD in other countries and in other years.

History In 1986, the Philadelphia Orchestra approved a plan to construct a new concert hall to replace the aging Academy of Music. It hoped to complete the new facility in time for its 1991 season. The desire to move the orchestra from its facilities in the Academy of Music emerged as early as 1908, however plans stalled due to the lack of consensus on the project's scope and funding. They were revived again in the 1920s only to be scuttled by the Great Depression. Plans emerged again shortly after World War II when performing arts centers were constructed in other cities such as New York, Washington and Los Angeles. Despite the 1986 commitment, the project languished until 1993 when Sidney Kimmel donated $12 million to the project and in 1995, Orchestra and community leaders met to help revitalize the concert hall and also discussed merging it with a venue to house other area organizations and visiting artists. The two projects were officially merged as the Regional Performing Arts Center in 1996 and construction began in 1998. In 2000, the center was named for Sidney Kimmel in recognition of his gift in 1993 and an additional $3 million donation in 1998. The concert hall was named Verizon Hall to recognize contributions totaling $14.5 million in cash, equipment and services from Verizon and the Verizon Foundation. 250px The architect of the Center was Rafael Viñoly, and the acoustician was Artec Consultants. The Kimmel Center officially opened in an unfinished state on December 16, 2001. This followed a gala preview on December 14 featuring performances by André Watts, Denyce Graves, Frederica von Stade and Sir Elton John and the Philadelphia Orchestra premier at Verizon Hall on December 15. Numerous cost overruns and construction delays led to the filing of a lawsuit in 2005 by officials of the Kimmel Center against Viñoly. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed sum in 2006. Performance and other facilities A distinctive vaulted glass ceiling encloses the entire structure providing a large common lobby for all the facilities. The Center is a popular attraction, keeping its doors open to the public seven days a week. It hosts thousands of visitors annually and offers free tours of the facility regularly. * Verizon Hall, with 2,500 seats, is the main performance auditorium. It contains a pipe organ by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders, which is the largest mechanical action pipe organ in an American concert hall. The organ is Dobson's Opus 76 and is named for Fred J. Cooper. It has two consoles with four manuals, 97 ranks and 124 stops. * Perelman Theater, with 650 seats, has a -diameter turntable stage that permits the space to be used as a recital hall or a proscenium theater with a stage, fly-loft and orchestra pit. * Dorrance H. Hamilton Roof Garden located above the Perelman Theater. * SEI Innovation Studio, a black box theater located on the lower levels of the Kimmel Center. * Smaller performance spaces and meeting rooms. Other noteworthy programs The Kimmel Center offers a variety of other programs besides concerts, specifically in the field of education. The Kimmel Center is home to its own Youth Jazz Orchestra called The Kimmel Center Youth Jazz Ensemble (KCYJE). This Ensemble includes many youth jazz musicians in the Philadelphia/New Jersey Area. The Ensemble is recognized as a youth version of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. Additionally, The Kimmel Center holds a Teen Summer Arts Camp annually where it offers ten-day programs in chamber music, choral/vocal music, and jazz.

Each of these fragments develop into matured organism, full grown individuals that are genetically and morphologically identical to their parents. The splitting may or may not be intentional – it may or may not occur due to man-made or natural damage by the environment or predators. This kind of organism may develop specific organs or zones that may be shed or easily broken off. If the splitting occurs without the prior preparation of the organism, both fragments must be able to regenerate the complete organism for it to function as reproduction. Fragmentation, also known as splitting and a method of reproduction is seen in many organisms such as in bacteria: filamentous cyanobacteria, in fungi like molds, lichens, many animals such as sponges, acoel flatworms, some annelid worms and sea stars.  Fragmentation in various organisms  Moulds, yeasts and mushrooms, all of which are part of the Fungi kingdom, produce tiny filaments called hyphae. These hyphae obtain food and nutrients from the body of other organisms to grow and fertilize. Then a piece of hyphae breaks off and grows into a new individual and the cycle continues. Many lichens produce specialized structures that can easily break away and disperse. These structures contain both the hyphae of the and the algae (phycobiont) (see soredia and isidia). Larger fragments of the thallus may break away when the lichen dries or due to mechanical disturbances (see the section on reproduction in lichens). Plants Fragmentation is a very common type of vegetative reproduction in plants. Many trees, shrubs, nonwoody perennials, and ferns form clonal colonies by producing new rooted shoots by rhizomes or stolons, which increases the diameter of the colony. If a rooted shoot becomes detached from the colony, then fragmentation has occurred. There are several other mechanisms of natural fragmentation in plants. *Production of specialized reproductive structures: A few plants produce adventitious plantlets on their leaves, which drop off and form independent plants, e.g. Tolmiea menziesii and Kalanchoe daigremontiana. Others produce organs like bulbils and turions. *Easily lost parts that have high potential to grow into a complete plant: Some woody plants like the willow naturally shed twigs. This is termed cladoptosis. The lost twigs may form roots in a suitable environment to establish a new plant. River currents often tear off branch fragments from certain cottonwood species growing on riverbanks. Fragments reaching suitable environments can root and establish new plants.Rood, S.B., Kalischuk, M.L., and Braatne, J.H. 2003. Branch propagation, not cladoptosis, permits dispersive, clonal reproduction of riparian cottonwoods. Forest Ecology and Management 186: 227–242. Some cacti and other plants have jointed stems. When a stem segment, called a pad, falls off, it can root and form a new plant. Leaves of some plants readily root when they fall off, e.g. Sedum and Echeveria. * Fragmentation is observed in nonvascular plants as well, for example, in liverworts and mosses. Small pieces of moss \\"stems\\" or \\"leaves\\" are often scattered by the wind, water or animals. If a moss fragment reaches a suitable environment, it can establish a new plant. They also produce gemmae, for example in the splash-cups of Marchantia polymorpha, that are easily broken off and distributed. People use fragmentation to artificially propagate many plants via division, layering, cuttings, grafting, micropropagation and storage organs, such as bulbs, corms, tubers and rhizomes. Animals Animals like sponges and coral colonies naturally fragment and reproduce. Many species of annelids and flat worms reproduce by this method. When the splitting occurs due to specific developmental changes, the terms architomy, paratomy and budding are used. In architomy the animal splits at a particular point and the two fragments regenerate the missing organs and tissues. The splitting is not preceded by the development of the tissues to be lost. Prior to splitting, the animal may develop furrows at the zone of splitting. The headless fragment has to regenerate a complete head. In paratomy, the split occurs perpendicular to the antero-posterior axis and the split is preceded by the \\"pregeneration\\" of the anterior structures in the posterior portion. The two organisms have their body axis aligned i.e. they develop in a head to tail fashion. Budding can be considered to be similar to paratomy except that the body axes need not be aligned: the new head may grow toward the side or even point backward (e.g. Convolutriloba retrogemma an acoel flat worm). =Coral= Corals can be multiplied in aquaria by attaching \\"frags\\" from a mother colony to a suitable substrate, such as a ceramic plug or a piece of live rock. This aquarium is designed specifically for growing coral colonies from frags. Many types of coral colonies can increase in number by fragmentation that occurs naturally or artificially. Within the reef aquarium hobby, enthusiasts regularly fragment corals for a multitude of purposes including shape control; selling to, trading with, or sharing with others; regrowth experiments; and minimizing damage to natural coral reefs. Both hard and soft corals can be fragmented. Genera that have shown to be highly tolerant of fragmentation include Acropora, Montipora, Pocillopora, Euphyllia, and Caulastraea among many others. Most sea anemones reproduce through fragmentation. There are a variety of methods including longitudinal fission, where the original anemone splits across the middle, forming two equal-sized anemones, and basal laceration, in which small parts of the animal split from the base and form a new anemone. = Echinoderms = In echinoderms, the process is usually known as fissiparity (a term also used infrequently for fission in general). Some species can intentionally reproduce in this manner through autotomy. This method is more common during the larval editing stages.  Disadvantage of this process of reproduction  As this process is a form of asexual reproduction, it does not produce genetic diversity in the offspring. Therefore, these are more vulnerable to changing environments, parasites and diseases.

She is responsible for her mother's well-being. Since her father's death, her brother Majid has been the family authority figure. His niece, Souhaire, does not want him choosing her husband. His marriage is rocky, and he insists on tradition. Sabah decides to start swimming again; an activity not allowed by Majid. At a city swimming pool she meets Stephen; they are attracted to each other. Because he is not a Muslim, Sabah hides their friendship from her family. With passage of time, their relationship gets deep and at one point they share a kiss. Sabah's niece teaches her belly dancing which Sabah enjoys. One day, while visiting Stephen at his carpenter workshop, she decides to stay overnight with him. Informing her mother that she will not be back that night, she dances and the two have sexual intercourse. The next day, as she returns home, she faces her mother, brother, sister, sister-in-law and niece who are anxiously waiting for her. After some hesitation, she tells them the truth about her doings in the last few months. Majid responds by announcing that Sabah is no longer a part of the family, as Muslim traditions forbid marriage for Muslim women to non-Muslims. Sabah leaves and Majid decides to take care of their mother. At Stephen's workshop, Sabah is met by her mother, sister and sister-in-law who insist that she speak to Majid. Majid tells her that the money their father left had run out eight years ago and he is supporting the family himself. Eventually both agree that the family must change. The women of the family are impressed by Stephen and his deep blue eyes. The film ends with a feast at Sabah's family home. Stephen is mingling with his in-laws and everyone is having a good time.

It breeds from southern Mexico south to northern Argentina, and on Trinidad and Tobago. It may have relatively recently colonised the latter island. It is associated with open woodland and cultivation with large trees, but is also the only cowbird that is found in deep forest. It is a quiet bird, particularly for an icterid, but the male has an unpleasant screeched whistle, shweeaa-tpic-tpic. The call is a sharp chek- chik. They are also very adept mimics. Like other cowbirds, it is a brood parasite, laying its eggs in the nests of oropendolas and caciques. The eggs are of two types, either whitish and unspotted, or pale blue or green with dark spots and blotches. The host's eggs and chicks are not destroyed. Their icterid hosts breed colonially, and defend their nests vigorously, so even a large, bold and aggressive species like the giant cowbird has to cover an extensive territory to find sufficient egg-laying opportunities. Several giant cowbird eggs may be laid in one host nest. The male giant cowbird is long, weighs and is iridescent black, with a long tail, long bill, small head, and a neck ruff which is expanded in display. The female is smaller, averaging long and weighing . She is less iridescent than the male, and the absence of the neck ruff makes her look less small-headed. Juvenile males are similar to the adult male, but browner, and with a pale, not black, bill. This gregarious bird feeds mainly on insects, and some seeds, including rice, and forages on the ground or in trees. It rarely perches on cattle, unlike some of its relatives, but in Brazil it will ride on capybaras as it removes horse flies.

The format originated on NeXTStep as \\"Multi-Architecture Binaries\\", and the concept is more generally known as a fat binary, as seen on Power Macintosh. With the release of Mac OS X Snow Leopard, and before that, since the move to 64-bit architectures in general, some software publishers such as Mozilla have used the term \\"universal\\" to refer to a fat binary that includes builds for both i386 (32-bit Intel) and x86_64 systems. The same mechanism that is used to select between the PowerPC or Intel builds of an application is also used to select between the 32-bit or 64-bit builds of either PowerPC or Intel architectures. Apple, however, continued to require native compatibility with both PowerPC and Intel in order to grant third-party software publishers permission to use Apple's trademarks related to universal binaries. Apple does not specify whether or not such third-party software publishers must (or should) bundle separate builds for all architectures. Universal binaries were introduced into Mac OS at the 2005 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a means to ease the transition from the existing PowerPC architecture to systems based on Intel processors, which began shipping in 2006. Universal binaries typically include both PowerPC and x86 versions of a compiled application. The operating system detects a universal binary by its header, and executes the appropriate section for the architecture in use. This allows the application to run natively on any supported architecture, with no negative performance impact beyond an increase in the storage space taken up by the larger binary. Starting with Mac OS X Snow Leopard, only Intel-based Macs are supported, so software that specifically depends upon capabilities present only in Mac OS X 10.6 or newer will only run on Intel-based Macs and therefore does not require Intel/PPC fat binaries. Additionally, starting with OS X Lion, only 64-bit Intel Macs are supported, so software that specifically depends on new features in OS X 10.7 or newer will only run on 64-bit processors and therefore does not require 32-bit/64-bit fat binaries. Fat binaries would only be necessary for software that is designed to have backward compatibility with older versions of Mac OS X running on older hardware. The new Universal 2 binary format was introduced at the 2020 Worldwide Developers Conference. Universal 2 allows applications to run on both Intel x86-64-based and ARM64-based Macintosh computers, for the Mac transition to Apple Silicon. Motivation There are two general alternative solutions. The first is to simply provide two separate binaries, one compiled for the x86 architecture and one for the PowerPC architecture. However, this can be confusing to software users unfamiliar with the difference between the two, although the confusion can be remedied through improved documentation, or the use of hybrid CDs. The other alternative is to rely on emulation of one architecture by a system running the other architecture. This approach results in lower performance, and is generally regarded an interim solution to be used only until universal binaries or specifically compiled binaries are available as with Rosetta. Universal binaries are larger than single-platform binaries, because multiple copies of the compiled code must be stored. However, because some non-executable resources are shared by the two architectures, the size of the resulting universal binary can be, and usually is, smaller than both binaries combined. They also do not require extra RAM because only one of those two copies is loaded for execution. History The concept of a universal binary originated with \\"Multi-Architecture Binaries\\" in NeXTSTEP, the main architectural foundation of Mac OS X. NeXTSTEP supports universal binaries so that one executable image can run on multiple architectures, including Motorola's m68k, Intel's x86, Sun Microsystems's SPARC, and Hewlett- Packard's PA-RISC. NeXTSTEP and macOS use Mach-O archive as the binary format underlying the universal binary. Apple previously used a similar technique during the transition from 68k processors to PowerPC in the mid-1990s. These dual-platform executables are called fat binaries, referring to their larger file size. Apple's Xcode 2.1 supports the creation of these files, a new feature in that release. A simple application developed with processor- independence in mind might require very few changes to compile as a universal binary, but a complex application designed to take advantage of architecture- specific features might require substantial modification. Applications originally built using other development tools might require additional modification. These reasons have been given for the delay between the introduction of Intel-based Macintosh computers and the availability of third- party applications in universal binary format. Apple's delivery of Intel-based computers several months ahead of their previously announced schedule is another factor in this gap. Apple's Xcode 2.4 takes the concept of universal binaries even further, by allowing four-architecture binaries to be created (32- and 64-bit for both Intel and PowerPC), therefore allowing a single executable to take full advantage of the CPU capabilities of any Mac OS X machine. =Universal applications= Many software developers have provided universal binary updates for their products since the 2005 WWDC. As of December 2008, Apple's website listed more than 7,500 Universal applications. On April 16, 2007, Adobe Systems announced the release of Adobe Creative Suite 3, the first version of the application suite in the Universal Binary format. From 2006 to 2010, many Mac OS X applications were ported to Universal Binary format, including QuarkXPress, Apple's own Final Cut Studio, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office 2008, and Shockwave Player with version 11 - after that time most were made Intel-only apps. Non-Universal 32-bit PowerPC programs will run on Intel Macs running Mac OS X 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6 (in most cases), but with non-optimal performance, since they must be translated on- the-fly by Rosetta; they will not run on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and later as Rosetta is no longer part of the OS. = iOS = Apple has used the same binary format as Universal Binaries for iOS applications by default on multiple occasions of architectural co-existence: around 2010 during the armv6-armv7-armv7s transition and around 2016 during the armv7-arm64 transition. The App Store automatically thins the binaries. No trade names were derived for this practice, as it is only a concern of the developer. = Universal 2 = On June 22, 2020, Apple announced a two-year permanent transition from Intel x86-64-based processors to ARM64-based Apple Silicon beginning with macOS Big Sur in late 2020. To aid in this transition, a new Universal 2 binary was introduced to enable applications to be run on either x86-64-based processors or ARM64-based processors.  Tools  The main tool for handling (creating or splitting) universal binaries is the command found in Xcode. The command on macOS and several other Unix-like systems can identify Mach-O universal binaries and report architecture support. Snow Leopard's System Profiler provides this information on the Applications tab.

Development  Originally released as Rat-Trap on the Commodore Amiga, it was developed by Fox Williams for the British software house Audiogenic, who licensed it to Acclaim Entertainment, the U.S.-based publishers of a range of games based on The Simpsons. Gameplay The player directs small rats to an extermination area through complicated maze-like levels. The player controls Krusty the Clown, who must navigate through his Krusty Brand Fun House. Each level is a puzzle in which a number of rats must be exterminated. Using different objects and obstacles, Krusty must create a path for the rats to follow and guide them towards an extermination device. Other creatures such as snakes, martians, flying pigs and birds attempt to hinder Krusty's progress by injuring him; he must throw pies in order to defeat them. In each stage the extermination devices are run by a different character, including Bart, Homer, Corporal Punishment and Sideshow Mel.  Release  The game was released in 1992 for the Amiga, NES, IBM PC, Sega Master System, Sega Game Gear, Game Boy, Super NES and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. Acclaim published the console versions, and sub-licensed the home computer versions to Virgin. The 16-bit versions on the Super NES and the Mega Drive/Genesis were entitled Krusty's Super Fun House. There are two revisions of the Super NES and Genesis games. Version 1.1 featured completely different music tracks for the second and fourth world. Reception Super Play magazine gave the SNES version of Krusty a 79 percent rating and wrote \\"it's actually pretty good fun to play, although perhaps more of a Younger Player-oriented game than anything else. Not one to set your heart on fire, but a good solid game nevertheless.\\" Computer Gaming World in April 1994 said that the computer version \\"is an above average arcade/strategy game that is ideal to burn away half an hour or so\\".

On a clear day at the top of the peak, facing east, northeast, and southeast, one can see the cities and suburbs of the Willamette Valley, as well as the Cascade Range. To the west, the Pacific Ocean is visible on clear days. The road to the peak now remains open in the winter. During the 2010–2011 winter, the Forest Service announced that it will leave the gates open to facilitate travel to the summit. The road will not be maintained, so a lifted 4x4 or four wheel chains are required for motor access during the winter months.

It was the longest-running punk venue in the western United States, and has been referred to by some journalists and historians as the \\"CBGB of the West Coast.\\" Located in a building that had served as a horse stable in the early 1900s, the club's owner, George Touhouliotis, founded Satyricon after acquiring a tavern that had operated in the building. Touhouliotis reshaped the tavern into a nightclub, and named it after the 1969 Federico Fellini film of the same name. Satyricon became a prominent music venue in the city, and hosted various local and touring punk and alternative rock bands throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In May 2003, the club abruptly closed, after which it was acquired by new owners and reopened as an all-ages venue in 2006. It officially closed in November 2010, and the building in which it was located was demolished in July 2011. The club was the subject of a 2013 documentary titled Satyricon: Madness and Glory. HistoryBackground= The Satyricon, located at 125 N.W. Sixth Avenue, was formerly Marlena's Tavern, \\"a dark, narrow barroom on a seedy stretch.\\" Prior to its establishment as a bar and restaurant, the building had served as a horse stable in the early 20th century before being converted into a tavern. Satyricon was founded by George Touhouliotis, a former taxi driver who acquired Marlena's Tavern in 1983. Upon taking ownership, Touhouliotis re- conceived the location as a nightclub that would offer live music. He named the club Satyricon after the 1969 Federico Fellini film of the same name. At the time, the surrounding Old Town Chinatown neighborhood had a seedy and dangerous reputation. The block was characterized as Portland's skid row, \\"a real shithole of a neighborhood\\" with \\"open drug dealing, fights, knives, [and] guns.\\" Local historian SP Clarke recalled that \\"A mere attempt to walk the sidewalks ... required a helmet and full body armor.\\" =Early years and heyday1980s Satyricon opened in March 1984, and attracted a wide array of musical groups, as the club's booking agent made \\"no stylistic or hierarchical\\" distinction among the musical acts. Local punk bands the Wipers and Poison Idea became notable regular acts at the club, as well as various underground musicians. According to public documents regarding the business's liquor control license, Satyricon opened at 8 p.m. each night, and offered \\"live music and dancing\\" from 10 p.m. until around 2:30 a.m. Additionally, the club hosted open mic nights, poetry readings, and performance art exhibitions. On September 20, 1985, Satyricon began offering food, which included a souvlaki take-out window called Eat or Die. By 1985, the club was selling around $7,000 of alcoholic beverages per month, and around $3,000 in food, with 20% of all food orders occurring through the take-out window. Owner Touhoulitis petitioned for the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) to allow for relaxations on allowing minors into the club's bandstand area between March 1984 and July 1985, but multiple incidents in which minors infiltrated the bar led the OLCC to determine that \\"the premises [are] not suitable for increased access by minors.\\" This largely had to do with the club's layout, which maintained little division between the bandstand and the bar. The interior of the building was described by journalists as such: Courtney Love and other patrons attending an event at Satyricon 1989 In the mid-1980s, the club was frequented by local residents such as poet Walt Curtis and Courtney Love, the latter of whom met friend and bandmate Kat Bjelland there in 1984 through The Miracle Workers' frontman Gerry Mohr. The club is also notable for being the place where Love first crossed paths with her future husband, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. In a 2010 interview, she claimed she met Cobain there in 1988 at a Dharma Bums concert where she was reading spoken word poetry, although other accounts state that the two met in January 1989 or 1990 when Nirvana was playing at the club, and that they playfully wrestled in front of a jukebox that night. Mark Arm of Mudhoney would later claim the story to be apocryphal, and that two in fact met while Mudhoney was touring with Love's band Hole in Europe in 1991. In a 2015 interview, Love clarified: \\"It was at the Satyricon ... I sometimes lie and say which bands were playing but I actually don't remember. But Nirvana was obviously playing. He was cute, he was attractive, and he was funny ... Everyone always writes that the song that was playing [on the jukebox] was Living Colour, but that wasn't it. It was \\"Dear Friend\\" by Flying Color. Commenting on the various stories and lore surrounding the club, journalist Zach Dundas wrote: \\"The written record of the club's existencewhich can amount to no more than 1 percent of the Whole Truthis a florid tale of excess, controversy, creative chaos. And, yes, artistic greatness.\\" 1990s In 1990, a benefit LP record was put out for the club called \\"Satyricon ... the Album\\". It included tracks from local punk acts such as Poison Idea, Dharma Bums and Napalm Beach. Beginning in the early 1990s, Satyricon became a frequent host to grunge bands, including Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, and Mudhoney, among others. In 1993, Satyricon opened its own restaurant called Fellini, a nod to the club's namesake. Dave Grohl played his first show with his post-Nirvana outfit Foo Fighters (after Cobain's suicide) at Satyricon. Other events, besides notable concerts, include a number of incidents involving notable people (including Courtney Love passing out) and a police riot in 1990. =Renovation and closure= Fucked Up performing at Satyricon, 2008 In May 2003, Satyricon abruptly closed and was slated to be taken over by the owners of another (former) club in town, Moody's. It reopened as an all-ages club in August 2006 under the management of the owners of the Loveland, an all-ages venue in Portland. Mild renovations were undertaken, though a review of the club upon its reopening noted: \\"The club looks the same ... eerily so. Same bar stools, same black paint. At the same time, it looks unfinished, like someone decided to remodel, ripped up a few boards and then totally slacked off.\\" In October 2010, Ben Munat, the Satyricon's booking agent, organized thirteen \\"Farewell Satyricon Shows\\" for that month. Bands included Big Daddy Meat Straw, the Dandy Warhols (with original drummer Eric Hedford, playing songs from first two albums with some original guitars), Pond, Poison Idea, and Napalm Beach, with the final concert taking place on October 31, 2010. Commenting on the club's closure, owner Touhouliotis said: \\"I had gotten tired. A place like that runs on creativity and energy; it's not automatic. And by the late '90s, the turn of the millennium, my energy wasn't there.\\" =Demolition and aftermath= Demolition of the building began in July 2011, after which many pieces of furniture, memorabilia, and parts of the building were \\"unceremoniously given away to anyone interested.\\" The urinal trough in the men's restroom was reportedly acquired by a tulip farm in Gresham. The marquee above the club's entrance was believed to have been either stolen or destroyed in the demolition process, as it remained unaccounted for. In 2017, Courtney Taylor-Taylor, frontman of the Dandy Warhols, reported that he had found the marquee, which he had installed at The Old Portland, a wine bar he opened in 2016. The location of the original building is now home to the nonprofit MacDonald Center service center and studio apartments to serve low-income residents. In popular culture The club was used as a filming location for Gus Van Sant's 1985 film, Mala Noche. In 2013, after its demolition, a documentary about the club, Satyricon: Madness and Glory, was released.

The Dharma Bums were a U.S. garage band, consisting of Jim Talstra, John Moen, Jeremy Wilson, and Eric Lovre. They named themselves after the Jack Kerouac book The Dharma Bums. The band was formed in 1987 in Portland, Oregon by members of two local bands, The Watchmen and Perfect Circle (no connection with the later bands The Watchmen or A Perfect Circle). Their first album, Haywire, was produced by Scott McCaughey (lead singer of the Young Fresh Fellows) and recorded for the PopLlama label in 1989. McCaughey later played their debut to Frontier Records boss Lisa Fancher, who was impressed enough to re-release the album. One of the tracks, \\"Boots of Leather\\", proved to be an enduring college radio hit. In 1990 the more polished album Bliss was released on Frontier Records. Featuring greatly improved songwriting, this release covered subjects including rape, adolescence, and suicide in a mature fashion built on ragged rock textures. The Dharma Bums recorded their third and final album Welcome for the Tim/Kerr label in 1991 and disbanded in 1992. Wilson went on to form the alt-rock band Pilot. Many in the local Portland scene had expected the Dharma Bums to be a breakthrough alternative rock act of the Northwest music scene, but Nirvana, a frequent opening act for the Dharma Bums, was to become the symbol of the genre instead.

Although originally slated to be a guide to all Simpsons games, it took over a year to obtain the necessary permissions, limiting its coverage to only Virtual Bart. Gameplay Bart motors through the ruins of Springfield in the \\"Post-Apocalypse\\" level of the Sega Genesis version. At a science fair, Bart wanders into a virtual reality exhibit and must pass all the \\"virtual worlds\\" (levels) to escape the machine. Passing a set of virtual worlds grants an ending sequence, and completing all the levels with all lives remaining wins the game. The format is similar to the previously released Bart's Nightmare, save for the lack of a hub world from which the levels are accessed. Gameplay for most of the levels consists of standard platforming elements. If the player runs out of lives, game over occurs. Reception Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the Super NES version a 4.8 out of 10, commenting that \\"The control is awful (like on the dinosaur stage), the stages unappealing, and the whole thing seems rushed.\\" Reviewing the Genesis port, GamePro praised it as being \\"virtual identical\\" to the SNES original.

A macaron ( ; ) or French macaroon ( ) is a sweet meringue-based confection made with egg white, icing sugar, granulated sugar, almond meal, and food colouring. There is some variation in whether the term macaron or macaroon is used, and the related coconut macaroon is often confused with the macaron. In North America, most bakers have adopted the French spelling of macaron for the meringue-based item to distinguish the two. Stanford professor of linguistics Daniel Jurafsky describes how the two confections have a shared history with macaroni (Italian ). Jurafsky notes that French words ending with \\"-on\\" that were borrowed into English in the 16th and 17th centuries are usually spelled with \\"-oon\\" (for example: balloon, cartoon, platoon). In the UK, many bakeries continue to use the term \\"macaroon\\". The macaron is traditionally held to have been introduced in France by the Italian chef of queen Catherine De Medici during the Renaissance. Since the 19th century, a typical Parisian-style macaron is presented with a ganache, buttercream or jam filling sandwiched between two such cookies, akin to a sandwich cookie. The confection is characterized by a smooth squared top, a ruffled circumference—referred to as the \\"crown\\" or \\"foot\\" (or \\"pied\\")—and a flat base. It is mildly moist and easily melts in the mouth. Macarons can be found in a wide variety of flavours that range from traditional (raspberry, chocolate) to unusual (foie gras, matcha). Past Picture from , by Albert Seigneurie, edited by L'Épicier in 1904, page 431. Macarons have been produced in the Venetian monasteries since the 8th century A.D. During the Renaissance, French queen Catherine de' Medici's Italian pastry chefs made them when she brought them with her to France in 1533 upon marrying Henry II of France. According to Larousse Gastronomique the macaron was created in 1791 in a convent near Cormery. In 1792, macarons began to gain fame when two Carmelite nuns, seeking asylum in Nancy during the French Revolution, baked and sold the macaron cookies in order to pay for their housing. These nuns became known as the \\"Macaron Sisters\\". In these early stages, macarons were served without special flavours or fillings. It was not until the 1930s that macarons began to be served two-by-two with the addition of jams, liqueurs, and spices. The macaron as it is known today, composed of two almond meringue discs filled with a layer of buttercream, jam, or ganache filling, was originally called the \\"Gerbet\\" or the \\"Paris macaron.\\" Pierre Desfontaines, of the French pâtisserie Ladurée, has sometimes been credited with its creation in the early part of the 20th century, but another baker, Claude Gerbet, also claims to have invented it. French macaron bakeries became trendy in North America in the 2010s. Earliest recipe Many Italian cookbooks of the 16th-century mention almond biscuits closely resembling macarons, albeit under different names. The earliest known recipe dates back to the early 17th century and appears to be inspired by a French version of the recipe. Method Macaron preparation There are two main methods for making a macaron – the \\"French\\" method and the \\"Italian\\" method. The difference between the two is the way the meringue is made. In the French method, egg whites are whisked until stiff- peaked meringue forms. From there, sifted, ground almonds and powdered sugar are folded in slowly until the desired consistency is reached. This process of knocking out air and folding is called macaronage. The Italian method involves whisking the egg whites with a hot sugar syrup to form a meringue. Sifted almonds and icing sugar are also mixed with raw egg whites to form a paste. The meringue and almond paste are mixed together to form the macaron mixture. This method is often deemed more structurally sound yet also sweeter and also requires a candy thermometer for the sugar syrup. Either Italian or French meringue can be combined with ground almonds. A macaron is made by combining icing sugar and ground almonds into a fine mixture. In a separate bowl, egg whites are beaten to a meringue-like consistency. The two elements are then folded together until they are the consistency of \\"shaving foam\\", and then are piped, left to form a skin, and baked. Sometimes, a filling is added. Variations Macarons in a variety of colours Macarons in a Pierre Marcolini shop window Macarons on sale at Two International Finance Centre (IFC), Hong Kong =France= Several French cities and regions claim long histories and variations, notably Lorraine (Nancy and Boulay), Basque Country (Saint-Jean- de-Luz), Saint-Émilion, Amiens, Montmorillon, Le Dorat, Sault, Chartres, Cormery, Joyeuse and Sainte-Croix in Burgundy. Macarons d'Amiens, made in Amiens, are small, round-shaped biscuit-type macarons made from almond paste, fruit and honey, which were first recorded in 1855. The city of Montmorillon is well known for its macarons and has a museum dedicated to them. The Maison Rannou-Métivier is the oldest macaron bakery in Montmorillon, dating back to 1920. The traditional recipe for Montmorillon macarons has remained unchanged for over 150 years. The town of Nancy in the Lorraine region has a storied history with the macaron. It is said that the abbess of Remiremont founded an order of nuns called the \\"Dames du Saint-Sacrement\\" with strict dietary rules prohibiting the consumption of meat. Two nuns, Sisters Marguerite, and Marie- Elisabeth are credited with creating the Nancy macaron to fit their dietary requirements. They became known as the 'Macaron Sisters' (Les Soeurs Macarons). In 1952, the city of Nancy honoured them by giving their name to the Rue de la Hache, where the macaron was invented. =Japan= Macarons in Japan are a popular confection known as マカロン (makaron). There is also another widely available version of makaron which substitutes peanut flour for almond and a wagashi-style flavouring. The makaron is featured in Japanese fashion through cell phone accessories, stickers, and cosmetics aimed towards women. =Switzerland= In Switzerland, the Luxemburgerli (also Luxembourger) is a brand name of confectionery made by the Confiserie Sprüngli in Zürich, Switzerland. A Luxemburgerli is a macaron comprising two disks of almond meringue with a buttercream filling, though different flavours are also available. Luxemburgerli are smaller and lighter than macarons from many other vendors. =United States= Pastry chefs in the US have edited the classic cookie to include more traditional American flavors. Flavours of macarons available in the US have been known to include mint chocolate chip, peanut butter and jelly, snickers, peach champagne, pistachio, strawberry cheesecake, candy corn, salted pretzel, chocolate peanut butter, oatmeal raisin, candy cane, cinnamon, maple bacon, pumpkin, and salted caramel popcorn. Popularity In Paris, the Ladurée chain of pastry shops has been known for its macarons for about . In Portugal, Australia, France, Belgium and Switzerland, McDonald's sells macarons in their McCafés (sometimes using advertising that likens the shape of a macaron to that of a hamburger). McCafé macarons are produced by Château Blanc, which, like Ladurée, is a subsidiary of Groupe Holder, though they do not use the same macaron recipe. Outside of Europe, the French-style macaron can be found in Canada and the United States. In Australia, Adriano Zumbo and his TV series MasterChef have contributed to the macaron becoming a popular sweet treat, and it is now sold by McDonald's in its Australian McCafe outlets.

July 5, 1979 - September 12, 2004) was a Palestinian journalist, killed on-camera in Baghdad, Iraq by U.S. helicopter gunfire while covering the Haifa Street helicopter incident. His last moments were recorded by the camera he had been reporting into, including his dying words as he gasped to his cameraman. The graphic tape of his death sparked an increase in concern for journalists reporting in occupied Iraq, as well as outrage in the Arab world. Tumeizi was a Palestinian reporter for Saudi-owned news networks al-Arabiya and al-Ikhbariya. He was the third al-Arabiya journalist to be killed in Iraq by U.S. forces, after reporter Ali al-Khatib and cameraman Ali Abdelaziz. Tumeizi died during the Haifa Street helicopter incident. The footage shows Tumeizi covering a group of curious Iraqis ululating around the wreckage of a U.S. Bradley Fighting Vehicle that had been recently abandoned after suffering damage from an improvised roadside bomb attack. A loud explosion can then be heard, followed by layers of smoke and debris. Tumeizi collapses from the impact, falling toward the camera, and the camera's lens is spattered with his blood as he falls. The cameraman (identified by Tumeizi as \\"Seif\\") loses focus, but Tumeizi's last words are captured in the camera's audio feed: :I'm going to die. I'm going to die. Seif. Seif. I'm going to die. \\"Seif\\" would later be identified as Reuters camera operator Seif Fouad, who was also injured in a subsequent rocket strike.  Reactions  Mazen al-Tumeizi was among 11 civilians killed in the Haifa Street attack on Sept. 12, 2004, after fighting between insurgents and members of the 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division when a United States Apache helicopter was called in to destroy a damaged Bradley Fighting Vehicle to prevent insurgents from looting its weapons and ammunition. International news agencies reported that Tumeizi began filming the abandoned vehicle's location three hours after it had been ambushed, a claim disputed by the U.S. military. The official military report places the time of the helicopter strike only 40 minutes after the Bradley's being ambushed, and states that the airstrike on the wrecked Bradley was called \\"to prevent looting and harm to the Iraqi people.\\" Naim Tubasi, chief of the Palestinian Journalists' Union, suggested Tumeizi's killing to have been a deliberate targeting of Arab journalists in Iraq, and called Tumeizi's killing \\"one more American crime in Iraq.\\" Najwa Kasem, an Al Arabiya anchor and former colleague of Tumeizi, reacted to American suggestions that Tumeizi was \\"one of the terrorists\\" by describing them as \\"really surprising and sad.\\"  External links  * Media spotlight on Baghdad deaths, September 13, 2004, BBC News * Fatal sign-off: Reporter's last words in Iraq mayhem, The Sydney Morning Herald * Interview with Al Arabiya reporter Najwa Kasem, former colleague of Tumeizi, Democracy Now! * Footage of Mazen Tumeisi's death, BBC Category:2004 deaths Category:Palestinian journalists Category:Journalists killed while covering the Iraq War Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Filmed killings ","title":"Mazen al-Tumeizi"},{"id":"2005225","text":"Hongmen seal, 19th century AmoyAlexander Wylie: Secret Societies in China, in China Researches, p131, 1897 Shanghai, reprinted in USA by Nabu Public Domain Reprints Hongmen seal, 19th century Guangdong The Tiandihui, the Heaven and Earth Society, also called Hongmen (the Vast Family), is a Chinese fraternal organization and historically, a secretive folk religious sect in the vein of the Ming loyalist White Lotus Sect, the Tiandihui's ancestral organization. As the Tiandihui spread through different counties and provinces, it branched off into many groups and became known by many names, including the Sanhehui. The Hongmen grouping is today more or less synonymous with the whole Tiandihui concept, although the title \\"Hongmen\\" is also claimed by some criminal groups. Its current iteration is purely secular. Under British rule in Hong Kong, all Chinese secret societies were collectively seen as criminal threats and were bundled together and defined as \\"Triads\\", although the Hongmen might be said to have differed in its nature from others. The name of the \\"Three Harmonies Society\\" (the \\"Sanhehui\\" grouping of the Tiandihui) is in fact the source of the term \\"Triad\\" that has become synonymous with Chinese organized crime. Because of that heritage, the Tiandihui (more commonly known there as \\"Triads') is both controversial and prohibited in Hong Kong. History Republican-era scholars generally thought that the Tiandihui was founded by Ming loyalists in the early Qing dynasty to resist the Manchu invasion of China. In 1964, scholar Cai Shaoqing published the article On the Origins of the Tiandihui () based on his research of Qing archives (now known as the First Historical Archives) in Beijing. He concluded that the Tiandihui was founded in 1761 and its roots lay in mutual aid rather than national politics. His interpretation was further developed by his student Qin Baoqi and confirmed by independent research by the Taiwanese scholar Zhuang Jifa. The founders of the Tiandihui—Ti Xi, Li Amin, Zhu Dingyuan, and Tao Yuan—were all from Zhangpu, Zhangzhou, Fujian, on the border with Guangdong. They left Zhangpu for Sichuan, where they joined a local cult and left disenchanted. Of the four, Ti Xi soon left for Guangdong, where he organized a group of followers in Huizhou. In 1761, he returned to Fujian and organized his followers from both provinces to form the Tiandihui. A century earlier, the Qing dynasty made membership in such societies illegal, driving them into the arms of the anti-Qing resistance, for whom they now served as an organizational model. The 18th century saw a proliferation of such societies, some of which were devoted to overthrowing the Qing, such as the Tiandihui, which had established itself in the Zhangpu and Pinghe counties of Zhangzhou in 1766. By 1767, Lu Mao had organized within the Tiandihui a campaign of robberies to fund their revolutionary activities. The Tiandihui began to claim that their society was born of an alliance between Ming dynasty loyalists and five survivors of the destruction of Shaolin Monastery—Chua Teck Tiong (), Hong Dai Ang (), Ma Chew Heng (), Ho Teck Deh (), and Lee Shih Kai ()—by the Ch'ing forged at the Honghua Ting (Hung Fa Ting, Vast or Red Flower Pavilion), where they swore to devote themselves to the mission of \\"Fan Ch'ing Fu Ming\\" ().http://www.wingchunpedia.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=WCP.WingChunKuenAndTheSecretSocieties- CollectedInformationByReneRitchie In 1768 anti-Qing Tiandihui rebel Zhao Liangming claimed to be a descendant of the imperial house of the Song dynasty.

Following the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty of China in 1911, the Hongmen suddenly found themselves without purpose. From then on, the Hongmen diverged into various groups. When some Hongmen groups based within China could no longer rely on donations from sympathetic locals; being unable to resume normal civilian lives after years of hiding, they turned to illegal activities – thus giving birth to the modern Triads. The Hongmen today The Hongmen is believed to consist of about 300,000 members worldwide, members found in mainland China, Taiwan, and Chinese overseas communities. Membership is overwhelmingly ethnically Chinese but there are also Japanese members and a few white American members. The Hongmen are divided into branches, of which there are believed to be approximately 180. The largest of the branches, Wu Sheng Shan, consists of perhaps 180,000 members. Membership is said to be primarily working class, and is also said to include a considerable membership in the armed forces of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Hongmen members worldwide continue to observe certain common traditions: they all stress their patriotic origin; they all revere Guan Yu, a historic Chinese figure who embodies righteousness, patriotism, and loyalty; and they all share certain rituals and traditions such as the concept of brotherhood and a secret handshake. =Hong Kong= Today, the Hongmen is an illegal society in Hong Kong because of its perceived or real links with the triads. =Taiwan= In Taiwan, by contrast, the Hongmen is not only legal, but politically influential; this is not surprising, since Sun Yat-sen, founding father of the Republic of China, was a senior figure within the Hongmen, as was nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Moreover, the Kuomintang, or Chinese Nationalist Party, was formed from the Xingzhonghui and Guangfuhui, groups not unlike the Hongmen. Because of the Hongmen's revolutionary character and mysterious quality, their future was unclear after the Republic of China central government moved to Taiwan. For a long time, the Republic of China on Taiwan did not openly allow the Hongmen to operate. After martial law ended in 1989, Ge Shan Tang formed and started exchange with the outside world. Under the influence of Chiang Kai-shek, the Hongmen attempted to remain somewhat secretive, but in recent years the organization's activities have been more transparent. The organization also has numerous business interests, and is reportedly trying to open a martial arts school in Taiwan. On 1 January 2004, Nan Hua Shan Tang was registered with Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior. =Mainland China= In Mainland China, the Hongmen is known as the Zhi Gong Party (), a political party that participates in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Wan Gang, president of the Zhi Gong Party, is currently the only non-Communist Party minister in the Chinese government. =Canada= The Canadian branch was established in 1863 in Barkerville, British Columbia. In 1971, Chinese Freemasons National Headquarters of Canada () was incorporated under the Canadian Corporations Act on 31 May 1971, and registered on 22 July 1971.Chinese Freemasons The Barkerville headquarter was donated to British Columbia government.百年历史的华人社团 加拿大洪门达权社 =Other= The Hongmen continues to exist within numerous overseas Chinese communities, albeit with rapidly aging memberships; its main purposes today are to act as fraternities among overseas Chinese, and to participate in charitable activities. On 28 July 1992 the Hongmen held their 3rd Worldwide Hongmen Conference in the United States. Over 100 worldwide representatives attended for two days of discussion and adopted organizational rules, proclaimed the founding of a worldwide Hongmen association. First session President Li Zhipeng announced the construction of the Hongmen headquarters in Honolulu.

Khuzestan is overlined in red. Although Herodotus and Xenophon referred to the entire region as Susiana, the name Khuzestan is what has been referred to the southwesternmost province of Persia (Iran) from antiquity. \\"Khuzestan\\", origins In some instances, sugar and sugar cane have been given as the meaning of Khuz.For example Dehkhoda Dictionary mentions this The fertile soil of Khuzestan has optimal potential for growing this plant, making excellent harvests for sugar cane possible here. However, most experts believe the name Khuzestan to be derived from Khūzī, the name of the original Elamite people who inhabited the region, whose distinctive language reportedly survived until Sassanid times.See Encyclopædia Iranica, Columbia University, Vol 1, p687-689. Every author of the early Islamic period, whether Arabic, Persian, or African, referred to the entire region as Ahvaz. This is verified by referring to texts such as those by Tabari, Abolfazl Beyhaghi, Tarikh-i Sistan, and Safar nama of Naser Khosrow, among many others. Hamdollah Mostowfi in his Nozhat ul-Qolub, for example, writes about Ardashir I in Ahvaz. The word \\"Khuzestan\\", however, seems to have been widely used to refer to the region by the 9th century. Some scholars believe Ahvaz and Khuzestan are related to the name Ooksin, a city established during the era of the Elamite civilization, and are the altered forms of the words Ooks, Ookz, Hookz, Huz and Khuz. Iraj Afshar in his Nigāhī bih Khūzistān : majmū\`ah´ī az awzā\`-i tārīkhī, jughrāfiyā'ī, ijtimā\`i, iqtisādī-i mintaqahLibrary of Congress CALL# DS324.K49 A37 1987, p66 states that Uxi was the Greek counterpart of the Elamite word Ūvja. According to Jules Oppert, the word Ūvja, was pronounced as Xuz or Khuz in the Elamite language. The word Ūvja appears abundantly in many texts and on Achaemenid inscriptions at Naqsh-e Rustam,See here and on Darius's epigraphs at Persepolis and Susa among othersSee here. Ūvja, or its Greek counterpart Uxi, were names used to refer to the land or the peoples inhabiting the land of Khuzestan. Furthermore, Ibn Nadeem, in his book al-Fihrist (), mentions that all the Median and Persian lands of antiquity spoke one language. In his book, which is the most credible account of spoken languages of Iran during the early Islamic era, he quotes the great scholar Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa: :\\"The Iranian languages are Fahlavi, Dari, Khuzi, Persian, and Suryani.\\" He then adds that Khuzi is the unofficial language of the royalty and comes from Khuzestan. In Majma-ul- Tawarikh wa al-Qesas (\\"The Collection of histories and Tales\\") written in 1126CE, Khuzestan appears with such names as Hajuestan, Hobujestan, and Ajar, which seem to be derived from Hobujestan and Hujestan in Pahlavi language. According to Sir Henry Rawlinson, in Pahlavi, Ūvja is pronounced Hobuj and therefore both the names Ahvaz and Khuzestan derive their names from here. The Old Persian word Hūjiya \\"Elam\\" appears abundantly in many texts and on Achaemenid inscriptions at Naqsh-e Rustam, and on Darius's epigraphs at Persepolis and Susa among others Hūjiya, or its Greek counterpart Uxi, Library of Congress DS 324 .K49 A37 1987 were names used to refer to the land or the peoples inhabiting Susiana. In Middle Persian, Hūjiya \\"Elam, Susiana Province\\" became Huź \\"Susiana\\", and the modern form of this word is Xuz. As with istan, the common Persian ending -stan \\"land, region\\" was added at some point. The Old Persian: Grammar, Texts, Lexicon by Roland G. Kent of the American Oriental Society, lists the following chains of derivation: Ūvja → Awaz → Xuz Ūvja → Ux → Xuz Ūvja → Xuz → Hobuj Ūvja → Hobuj → Xuz → Hoz Ūvja → Hobuj → Xuz → Hoz → Ahvaz Whereas in some Iranian dialects such as Luri and Bakhtiari (also based in and around Khuzestan), the sound \\"h\\" is sometimes used for pronouncing Kh, the words oo, hoo and Khuz have in the process of time been added to the suffix -estan, and the word oojestan has gradually changed to Hujestan, forming the word Khuzestan. Such conversions derive from the fact that in ancient Persian dialects and in Pahlavi language, the sound \\"oo\\" was changeable to \\"hoo\\" as in such words like Oormazd → Hoormazd or Ooshmand → Hooshmand. And Hoordad has also been pronounced Khordad and Khoortat. Arabistan Most Arabs such as the Bani Kaab tribe, came from the west and southwest of the Tigris and Euphrates outside of Khuzestan, beginning in the 15-16th centuries. During the succeeding centuries many more Arab tribes moved from southern Iraq to Khuzestan; as a result, Khuzestan gained the second name Arabistan, and became extensively Arabized. In 1441, Muhammad ibn Falah, founder and leader of the Msha'sha'iya, initiated a wave of attacks on Khuzestan, and the cities of Hoveizeh, Khorramshahr, Ahvaz, and Susa started seeing large increases in Arab populations. The term Arabistan thus came into use to refer to the Arab populated areas of this region. At this time, many texts started using both Khuzestan and Arabistan as the region's name. Examples are Majalis Al-Mumineen written by Ghadhi Nurollah Shushtari in 1585, Giti Gosha by Mirza Muhammad Sadigh Musawi, Nasikh Al-Tawarikh by Lisan Malek Sepehr, Muntazam Naseri and Mar'at ul-Baladan by Sani ol molk, Sharh Waghi'a by Ismail Mirza Dorughi, and the Afsharid era work Jahan goshay-i Naderi. The Safavid era account History of Alam Aray Abbasi speaks of dispatching troops to \\"Khuzestan wa Arabistan\\" during the 8th year of Shah Abbas' reign. The name Arabistan, however, became more prevalent over time as the British became gradually involved in the Persian Gulf region. By the time of the Qajar Mozaffareddin Shah, the name Arabistan was meant to completely refer to all of Khuzestan.Yaghma, 3rd year, no 9, p389-396 for a more detailed account of this process. With the centralized Pahlavi government of Iran gradually strengthening, Reza Shah restored the name of the province to its original in 1923.

Style and influences Moodymann is considered to have \\"developed hybrid modes of recording and performance incorporating analog and digital media—the playing of 'real' instruments with 'pushing buttons live'.\\" Philip Sherburne of Pitchfork wrote: \\"His sample-heavy productions have drawn on artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Chic, not to mention gospel music, and his beats have always remained rooted in disco's bump and swirl.\\" Personal life In January 2019, Moodymann released a video on Instagram, which he later removed, showing the Highland Park police holding him at gunpoint in his parked car, on his property. The Highland Park police department released a statement saying that during the incident, Moodymann did not show proof of ownership of the property or even an ID, which led to the arrest.

Created in 1924, it has evolved into a leading membership organization providing education, research, support, and advocacy to city leaders across America. Based in Washington, D.C., it is considered part of the 'Big Seven', a group of organizations that represent local and state government in the United States. The NLC provides training to municipal officials, holds conferences, lobbies and provides assistance to cities in educational issues. NLC was first founded as the American Municipal Association in Lawrence, Kansas, by a group of 10 state municipal leagues seeking greater coordination and representation in national affairs. In 1947, the organization opened its membership to individual cities with populations of 100,000 or more. That membership threshold was gradually moved downward, and in 1964, to signal the organization's growing emphasis on cities as members, the American Municipal Association changed its name to the current. By 1977, the population requirement was eliminated. Today, NLC represents over 1,900 member cities as a convening organization, support network, and representative in federal affairs. Leading priorities for the group include the economy, infrastructure, public safety, technology, education, and families. History The National League of Cities was founded in 1924 when 10 state municipal leagues banded together as the American Municipal Association.National League of Cities: State Municipal Leagues Over time, the organization's membership expanded to include individual cities of all sizes.Josh Fecht, The National League of Cities speaks for more than 18,000 US communities, City Mayors website, accessed August 17, 2009 Over its decades- long history, NLC has played a prominent role in shaping federal urban policy and defining city issues in America. It was at a 1970 convention that William Ruckelshaus, Administrator of the newly created Environmental Protection Agency, announced an order against Cleveland, Detroit, and Atlanta to clean up their inadequately treated sewage discharges into rivers, thereby helping send a message that the young agency meant business.EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus and his former assistants recall the dramatic announcement when the fledgling agency in 1970 ordered several cities to clean up their sewage discharges. Video,Transcript (see p5). Programs Federal advocacy = NLC lobbies Congress on multiple issues, including city infrastructure, particularly transportation; supporting local energy efficiency and conservation efforts; strengthening and stabilizing the housing market; helping build stable families; supporting community safety; and reforming the country's immigration system. NLC's core lobbying principles include avoiding unfunded mandates, preserving local authority and protecting the intergovernmental partnership. = Institute for Youth, Education and Families = The Institute for Youth, Education, and Families is an entity within NLC which assists municipal officials in providing services on behalf of the children, youth and families in their communities. The YEF Institute offers resources in five core program areas, including early childhood success, education and afterschool, benefits for working families, youth participation in local government and child and youth safety. = Conferences = NLC hosts the annual Congress of Cities & Exposition, at which municipal officials participate in workshops, general sessions, networking opportunities and leadership training seminars. NLC's other yearly conference is the Congressional City Conference, held each March in Washington, D.C. Thousands of municipal officials discuss NLC legislative priorities with Members of Congress and the Administration, share promising practices, discuss policy and participate in leadership training opportunities. = Center for City Solutions = NLC's Center for City Solutions offers information, research, training, and educational materials on issues cities face in the present and future. Its programs include an applied research group along with the Rose Center for Public Leadership, the Sustainable Cities Institute, the City Innovation Ecosystems initiative, and the NLC University divisions.  Publications  The National League of Cities oversees a range of publications including the blog 'CitiesSpeak', the newsletter 'The Weekly' (formerly Nation's Cities Weekly), and several social media channels. NLC also produces original research on topics such as technology, education, municipal finance, public safety, and mayors' priorities. Leadership The National League of Cities is overseen by a board of directors, which elects a president, vice president, and second vice president in annual elections. Each president serves a one-year term, typically choosing to focus on a single program or advocacy priority such as economic mobility or public safety.

Plot Set in Port of Spain, Trinidad, the book opens with Mr. Haynes deciding to rent part of a house situated nearby on the title street—a very short alley. His mother has died, and he is trying to make the best out of an otherwise dull life. Figuring out how to pay for the house, he arrives there the following day, meeting Maisie and her aunt, Mrs. Rouse, who has a small room to let. Haynes agrees to use it after hearing of the conditions and the price—$2.50. Early next morning, Haynes begins transferring his goods to his new home. Back at that residence, he is introduced to his new landlord, Mr. Benoit. On the first Saturday evening of his stay, he meets a sick Miss Atwell and an East Indian servant named Philomen, as well as a cake- seller named John. Later on, Mrs. Rouse arrives with her new lodger, a nurse named Jackson, and the rest in the house engage in a lot of conversation soon after. Yet after such good times, Haynes is bored and wants to move out of No. 2 in a month, in which case he will leave the rest up to Ella. The next morning, while Rouse and niece are attending Mass, he secretly encounters a brief love affair between Benoit and the lodger nurse. As days go by, that nurse becomes the dominant factor of life at No. 2, keeping the entire house in full shape. One morning, a stay-at-home Haynes witnesses Sonny, Nurse Jackson's son, being beaten by the landlord over his prize for winning a marbles game: a kiss for his opponent, Maisie. After a caning from the nurse, he is chased by her all the way to Haynes’ room, where he hides from her. Then, as she calls him out like she would a dog, Haynes misses his chance to save Sonny, who is intent on staying with him for protection. But upon a further caning by Sonny’s mother, the bachelor decides he must move back to Ella, even with an injured foot. That evening, the nurse comes by to check on his foot and have it treated—the first of such a series of twice-daily visits. Only some days later does his foot become any better. Another few days pass, and the people at No. 2 are preparing to avoid the local bailiff and Mr. Brown from visiting their home. Luckily, both are nowhere to be seen; but word of the two crops up in their conversations for days afterward. Because of a fight between her and Mrs. Rouse, the nurse soon leaves the house. Troubled times thus begin herein: another morning later, a policeman asks for Aucher, who turns out to be a thief; and quarrels between Benoit and Mrs. Rouse erupt for nights at a time, all due to the nurse's departure and her love for the landlord. Even the two try to murder each other, and for that action Haynes decides strongly to move out. Surprisingly, Nurse Jackson passes her examinations, thanks partly to Benoit's help, but nothing more than her affair with the landlord is talked of for days at No. 2. More surprisingly, they both have been engaged, and news of their romance and upcoming marriage crops up regularly soon after. Their wedding takes place at nine on a Sunday morning, at the start of the month, but the people at the house are getting impatient about Miss Atwell's arrival from the ceremony. When she returns at eleven, she tells them everything that happened during that ceremony (the centre of attention being the nurse's expensive white fugi dress). Later on, No. 2 is put up for mortgage, but as an ailing Mrs. Rouse is warned by Haynes, it will take eight years before the house can fully be paid off, even with her cake business on the decline. With Mrs. Rouse, Haynes learns how much the house has fared from the time it was built at the start of the First World War. Then, upon visiting her, he learns of Ella's sickness and that a friend will replace her once she is taken to her mother in the country. December comes, and Haynes, meeting Benoit for the first time since he married the nurse, is nervous to see how much he has changed. It is rumoured that things have not been going well for the couple, and the landlord has had no new job out of this. In spite of their recent woes, Christmas goes on cheerfully for the residents of the house. During the holiday, a freed Aucher helps the rest of them as they work harder than ever to keep No. 2 clean, while Haynes decides to spend some time at the seaside for his health's sake. On Boxing Day, the company at the house, Haynes included, delight themselves with an enjoyable lunch, after which Miss Atwell honours Haynes in a short speech. The bachelor's reply turns out to be \\"the speech of his life\\". On New Year's Eve, Miss Atwell pays Haynes a visit, telling him Ella is still sick. On the New Year's holiday the following day, he pays Mrs. Rouse $20 in advance (a plan he had made with Maisie) for the sake of remaining at the house via boarding. Three days later, he learns of the now-recovered headmistress' return to town, even though she has not come to No. 2, because Haynes feels that he does not want her. For another two or three days, he ponders on what has recently come of him. In the midst of a quarrel between Rouse and niece, over Haynes' alienation from Ella, the bachelor is refunded his boarding fee. Now he wants to strike out vulgarly against them both. Late one afternoon, while on a tramcar in town, Haynes encounters the nurse being arrested for stealing clothes. He hurries home to tell everyone at No. 2 about it, but all of them are hearing Philomen's account of the event as he arrives. Then Haynes reads a letter from Nurse Jackson addressed to Rouse, in which the nurse defames Rouse's past relationship with Benoit. With Jackson on bail, gloom hangs over No. 2 once again. On the morning of her trial, everyone but Aucher is in Court to hear of the nurse's fate: she is fined £15 or three months in prison. (This is the last time Haynes will ever see her again in person.) Later, due to accusations about her husband living with another woman, the nurse and her son leave for the United States. After the case, Haynes finds a friend—and lover—in Rouse's niece. But she wants to avoid the presence of her aunt's secret admirer, Sgt. Parkes (a father of six), for fear of a do-over of Rouse's former affairs with Benoit. She does so on the Friday morning of his visit, and for this, Haynes gets upset over Maisie. Later that afternoon, Mrs. Rouse tells him, in distaste, that Benoit has returned by surprise. And at dusk, Aucher tells them the sergeant (whom Rouse is not interested in seeing) has come back. For the next several weeks, Mrs. Rouse tries not to let her house be sold, without Mr. Rojas' help, to a woman who is willing to buy the property. One day, nearly a year after his debut at No. 2, Haynes stunningly finds the major compartments of the kitchen have moved to outside for the sake of convenience. Then, he discovers just how much Philomen has changed in weight and appearance. This is due to heavy work and a love affair with Sugedo, which makes Maisie develop hatred for the servant. To avoid further trouble with Rouse, she is forced to move out of her home and live with her new employer, Gomes. A tearful farewell takes place at No. 2, whence Mrs. Rouse also cries for her before she leaves; Haynes is a part of it as well. Just when life at No. 2 begins anew without Philomen, so its trials and tribulations resume: Maisie and some others are soon accused by Mrs. Rouse for being involved in a string of petty thefts, rising by the score. It comes to a climax one Sunday morning when Mrs. Rouse finds a dollar bill belonging to Haynes, with her niece unwilling to admit to this theft. She disappears from Haynes' sight the rest of the day. After spending a worryfree August by the seaside while on leave, Haynes returns to No. 2 on the final day of the month—a rainy Sunday—and finds out that nothing has changed. As Mrs. Rouse calls for Maisie, right before Haynes and a few lodgers, the niece speaks out against her being treated by her aunt, and also against her aunt's past love life with Benoit. Thus the ultimate quarrel between the two ensues on a now- muddy yard, during which Mrs. Rouse throws away all of her niece's goods out into the mire. Supporting his now almost-defeated lover, Haynes is angry at her aunt, while the niece, in revenge, ruins some of her aunt's attire amid her own outfits. Angry at Mrs. Rouse, she sneaks away from the rest of the lodgers. Four nights later, Haynes meets her at a nearby park for the last time; she tells the bachelor of her plans for New York City. Another two days pass before she heads to the Big Apple by boat. Life at No. 2, for Haynes, will never be the same without her, and thus he cannot afford to stay there. As September comes to an end, Rouse informs him that the former landlord has suffered a stroke, which she is not sorry to see him get. Both head to the Government Hospital that Sunday night to make sure he is there, since they are unable to visit him. The two of them leave, walking up the street—Rouse to her church for prayers, and Haynes to No. 2, where he and Miss Atwell discuss about Benoit's past and present. Rouse joins them both after her session has finished. Late that same night, Haynes decides that he should end his life at the house, for all the effects that Maisie's immigration has left on him. Next morning, 22 September, he wakes up uneasily to the news of McCarthy Benoit's death: this event, in turn, causes regular life at No. 2 to come to an end. Entering October, Haynes finds new lodgings with Ella's help, and this leaves Rouse and Atwell as the caretakers of the house before it can legally be sold. (Gomes [Haynes' new neighbour] and Mr. Rojas are taking over Rouse's declining cake business.) Though his visits are less frequent in time to come, bachelor Haynes often passes by No. 2, thinking of all that used to happen there. At the end of the novel, a family of five—husband, wife and three children—happen to be its new residents.

Retrieved on 16 May 2013. Plot summary The story follows a dinner party given by Bertha Young and her husband Harry. The writing shows Bertha depicted as a happy soul, though quite naive about the world she lives in and those closest to her. The story opened up a lot of questions, about deceit, about knowing oneself and also about the possibility of homosexuality at the start of the 20th century. The story gives us a bird's eye view of the dinner party, which is attended by a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Norman Knight, who are close friends to Bertha and Harry. Guest, Eddie Warren, is an effeminate character, who adds an interesting mix to someone who Bertha is mysteriously drawn to for reasons unknown to her at the start. The interesting thing is that Bertha's husband is presented to the reader as Bertha perceives him in her mind. Because Bertha is so naive, the reader first gets the impression that Harry is a crude, disinterested person who has a strong dislike for Pearl by his conversational tone and curtness towards her as the conversation unfolds. As the dinner party progresses, Bertha questions her own interest and fascination towards Pearl. The fact that Eddie, who is most likely homosexual, is present, lends an air to the possibility that Bertha's interest in Pearl is more than a platonic feeling one has towards a friend of the same sex. It is only after Bertha analyzes her feelings towards Pearl that she realizes that the connection she feels with Pearl is their mutual attraction for Harry, and coming out of her \\"blissful\\" reverie she makes the discovery that Harry and Pearl are having an affair. The title to this story alludes to the sentiment that ignorance is bliss. The story leaves the question about whether it is best to live blissfully ignorant of the truth or live with the knowledge of a harsh reality.

It lies on the west bank of the Rideau River and marks the eastern edge of the Sandy Hill neighbourhood. The area of the park was originally the swampy floodplain of the river and impossible to build on. The site first became home of the Dominion Rifle Range, where soldiers had trained before departing for the Second Boer War. That history is preserved in the name of Range Road, which runs along the west of the park. The area was turned into a park by the Ottawa Improvement Commission between 1904 and 1907. It was named after Lord Strathcona, a Canadian businessman and politician who had financed his own regiment in the war. The most prominent feature of the park is the fountain atop the hill; it was donated by Lord Strathcona in 1909 and sculpted by Mathurin Moreau.Strathcona Park fountain turns 100; Solving some of the mysteries surrounding the Sandy Hill landmark The park's original design was a classic example of English public park design. It contained a pair of small ponds, gazebos, and Ottawa's first golf course. In the 1940s, the ponds were filled in because of their expense and replaced with a wading pool. A baseball diamond was constructed at the southern end of the park in the 1920s and, for many years, was Ottawa's main venue for the sport. The banks of the Rideau were once a popular swimming area, but the perception of pollution now make that unpopular. During the summer, the water level is low enough to ford the river and cross to Riverain Park in Vanier, but the Adàwe Crossing bridge, opened in December 2015, now makes fording the river unnecessary. Just to the south of Strathcona Park is Dutchy's Hole Park and Robinson Field. In the winter, the park, with its large hill at the northern end, is a popular site for tobogganing and making snowboard jumps. The park remained under the control of the OIC successor agency the National Capital Commission until 1987, when it did not renew its lease with the city. Since then, the park has been managed by the municipality. In the early 1990s, the park was refurbished by the city. One of the most noted additions was the play structure designed by artist Stephen Brathwaite, who designed a structure to look like ruins and was inspired by Mackenzie King's ruin garden at Kingsmere. The structure was assembled out of blocks of stone that had been part of the Parliament buildings, the Chateau Laurier, and other prominent Ottawa structures. Since 1986, the park has been home to Odyssey Theatre, a professional company that presents open-air plays each summer on a stage at the northeast corner of the park. Odyssey Theatre's unique performances of classical plays and original creations are inspired by the Italian commedia dell'arte and incorporate international forms of puppetry, clowning, and dance-theatre. In July 2014, the city began construction of a pedestrian and cyclist bridge across the Rideau River to connect the Rideau River Eastern Pathway at Donald Street with Strathcona Park and Somerset Street East. The park is surrounded by a series of large homes that once housed the elite of Ottawa. Most are now embassies, and the area around the park is often called Ottawa's Embassy Row. Perched above the park is the Russian embassy, formerly the Soviet Union embassy.

Foundation With the 1950s backlash against comics, led by the psychiatrist Fredric Wertham, and propagated during the televised debates about comics leading to juvenile delinquency, as part of the Kefauver hearings, several publishing houses folded. This caused a problem for the printers. As Joe Simon detailed, \\"Comic book publishers were dropping out of the business in wholesale numbers. The printers grew frantic. It was a necessity of their business that the presses keep running. When the presses were silent, printing companies still had to pay overhead, so they were more than willing to back a new comics organization if it showed promise.\\" Reissued (Vanguard Productions, 2003) . Page numbers refer to 1990 edition. To serve as business manager for their Mainline Publications, Inc., they brought in Crestwood Publications office manager Nevin Fidler, who knew the mechanics of distributors and other necessary vendors, offering him a piece of the company. While keeping their hand in at Crestwood to fulfill their contract, Simon and Kirby invested their savings in their new company, working with veteran paper and printing broker George Dougherty, Jr.Beerbohm, Robert Lee. \\"The Mainline Story\\", Jack Kirby Collector #25, August 1999. Accessed March 26, 2008. WebCitation archive. The two had long wanted to self-publish, and they further wished to create comics for the adults of the 1950s who had read comics as children in the 1940s. As Simon recalled, They set up shop in late 1953 or early 1954, subletting space from their friend Al Harvey's Harvey Publications at 1860 Broadway. Mainline published four titles: the Western Bullseye: Western Scout; the war comic Foxhole, since EC Comics and Atlas Comics were having success with war comics, but Mainline's was promoted as being \\"written and drawn by actual veterans\\"; In Love, as their earlier romance comic Young Love was still being widely imitated; and the crime comic Police Trap, which claimed to be based on genuine accounts by law-enforcement officials. Controversy Despite Mainline's dissimilarity to the beleaguered EC and other companies then under constant attack, copies of Bullseye and Foxhole were reportedly used as exhibits by Wertham in the Senate hearings against comics, and seen by millions through the hearings' nationwide television coverage. In an attempt to save on the cost of original artwork for a story in Crestwood's Young Love, Simon recycled an earlier Crestwood story by providing a new story and title to fit the existing art. This was spotted by a Crestwood employee, and legal advice taken over possible repercussions. Crestwood \\"took up the matter with their attorney [who] informed Crestwood that there was nothing in the contract that specified what kind of book we were obliged to turn in — as long as we turned in a book on schedule. That didn't satisfy the publishers, who naturally turned more hostile. They continued to hold off paying us while we grew increasingly desperate.\\" In response, Simon and Kirby arranged in November 1954 to audit Crestwood, leading to a meeting between, on one side, Simon, Kirby, their accountant Bernard Gwirtzman and the attorney Gwirtzman chose, Morris Eisenstein;Simon, p. 161 and on the other Crestwood publishers Teddy Epstein and Paul BleierAlso spelled \\"Blyer\\" by Ronin.

Eisenstein demanded monies owed his clients by \\"Crestwood, Feature Publications, and Headline Publications, among others,\\" entailing \\"advances, royalties, and other monies for Fighting American, Young Brides, Black Magic, Young Love, and Young Romance.\\" Epstein countered that all monies had been paid, and no royalties withheld, so Gwirtzman clarified that the claimed funds derived largely from overseas sales, and that over the previous seven years the total was around $130,000. Crestwood's attorney responded that the company could not pay that much, and, were it to go to court, \\"would simply close down.\\" Offered a $10,000 settlement and the recently delayed payments, Simon and Kirby returned to working on Mainline, but under increasingly strained circumstances. Even the Simon/Kirby relationship was now fraught, the two \\"barely [speaking] while working in the same room.\\" Collapse With the continuing attacks by Wertham, Senator Estes Kefauver, and others, publishers continued to fold \\"and the number of comics published dropped from 650 to 250.\\" Carmine Infantino, a friend of Kirby's who worked for National Comics, the future DC Comics, recalled that National publisher Jack Liebowitz, Atlas Comics publisher Martin Goodman, \\"and the people from Archie [MLJ Comics], got together and created the Comics Code, which promised parents they would have no more blood and stuff like that.\\" The advent of the Code effectively gutted EC Comics and threatened the comics industry generally. Distributor Leader News \\"no longer had enough money to advance to small companies like Mainline\\", and with its implosion brought about the end of Simon and Kirby's company in late 1956. The unpublished materials for Mainline's titles were sold to Charlton Comics, which published them and, in some cases, continued the titles under new names. With the demise of Mainline, the longstanding partnership between Simon and Kirby also ended, although they would collaborate on a few more comics. Simon left comics for a time to take up a role in advertising, and Kirby returned to National Comics, taking with him, with Simon's blessing, \\"the final project of the Simon & Kirby team\\", Challengers of the Unknown, co-created with writers Dick and Dave Wood. The non-superpowered adventuring quartet appeared in National's Showcase #6 (Feb. 1957) and eventually in its own series.

The resulting digest or fingerprint is then encrypted to hide the identity of the hash function used. As with any MAC, it may be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a message. A specific type of UMAC, also commonly referred to just UMAC, is specified in RFC 4418, it has provable cryptographic strength and is usually a lot less computationally intensive than other MACs. UMAC's design is optimized for 32-bit architectures with SIMD support, with a performance of 1 CPU cycle per byte (cpb) with SIMD and 2 cpb without SIMD. A closely related variant of UMAC that is optimized for 64-bit architectures is given by VMAC, which has been submitted to the IETF as a draft () but never gathered enough attention for becoming a standardized RFC.  Background Universal hashing= Let's say the hash function is chosen from a class of hash functions H, which maps messages into D, the set of possible message digests. This class is called universal if, for any distinct pair of messages, there are at most H/D functions that map them to the same member of D. This means that if an attacker wants to replace one message with another and, from his point of view the hash function was chosen completely randomly, the probability that the UMAC will not detect his modification is at most 1/D. But this definition is not strong enough -- if the possible messages are 0 and 1, D={0,1} and H consists of the identity operation and not, H is universal. But even if the digest is encrypted by modular addition, the attacker can change the message and the digest at the same time and the receiver wouldn't know the difference. =Strongly universal hashing= A class of hash functions H that is good to use will make it difficult for an attacker to guess the correct digest d of a fake message f after intercepting one message a with digest c. In other words, :\\\\Pr_{h \\\\in H}[h(f)=dh(a)=c]\\\\, needs to be very small, preferably 1/D. It is easy to construct a class of hash functions when D is field. For example, if D is prime, all the operations are taken modulo D. The message a is then encoded as an n-dimensional vector over D (a1, a2, ..., an). H then has Dn+1 members, each corresponding to an (n + 1)-dimensional vector over D (h0, h1, ..., hn). If we let : h(a)=h_0+\\\\sum_{i=1}^n h_ia_i\\\\, we can use the rules of probabilities and combinatorics to prove that :\\\\Pr_{h \\\\in H}[h(f)=dh(a)=c]={1 \\\\over D} If we properly encrypt all the digests (e.g. with a one-time pad), an attacker cannot learn anything from them and the same hash function can be used for all communication between the two parties. This may not be true for ECB encryption because it may be quite likely that two messages produce the same hash value. Then some kind of initialization vector should be used, which is often called the nonce. It has become common practice to set h0 = f(nonce), where f is also secret. Notice that having massive amounts of computer power does not help the attacker at all. If the recipient limits the amount of forgeries it accepts (by sleeping whenever it detects one), D can be 232 or smaller. =Example= The following C function generates a 24 bit UMAC. It assumes that \`secret\` is a multiple of 24 bits, \`msg\` is not longer than \`secret\` and \`result\` already contains the 24 secret bits e.g. f(nonce). nonce does not need to be contained in \`msg\`. /* DUBIOUS: This does not seem to have anything to do with the (likely long) RFC * definiton.

The NH family halves the number of multiplications, which roughly translates to a two-fold speed-up in practice., section 5.3 For speed, UMAC uses the NH hash-function family. NH is specifically designed to use SIMD instructions, and hence UMAC is the first MAC function optimized for SIMD. The following hash family is 2^{-w}-universal:, Equation 1 and also section 4.2 \\"Definition of NH\\". : \\\\operatorname{NH}_{K}(M) = \\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=0}^{ (n/2)-1 } ((m_{2i} + k_{2i}) \\\\bmod ~ 2^w ) \\\\cdot ((m_{2i+1} + k_{2i+1}) \\\\bmod ~ 2^w ) \\\\right) \\\\bmod ~ 2^{2w} . where * The message M is encoded as an n-dimensional vector of w-bit words (m0, m1, m2, ..., mn-1). * The intermediate key K is encoded as an n+1-dimensional vector of w-bit words (k0, k1, k2, ..., kn). A pseudorandom generator generates K from a shared secret key. Practically, NH is done in unsigned integers. All multiplications are mod 2^w, all additions mod 2^w/2, and all inputs as are a vector of half- words (w/2 = 32-bit integers). The algorithm will then use \\\\lceil k/2 \\\\rceil multiplications, where k was the number of half-words in the vector. Thus, the algorithm runs at a \\"rate\\" of one multiplication per word of input. = RFC 4418 = RFC 4418 does a lot to wrap NH to make it a good UMAC. The overall UHASH (\\"Universal Hash Function\\") routine produces a variable length of tags, which corrsponds to the number of iterations (and the total lengths of keys) needed in all three layers of its hashing. Several calls to an AES-based key derivation function is used to provide keys for all three keyed hashes. * Layer 1 (1024 byte chunks -> 8 byte hashes concatenated) uses NH because it is fast. * Layer 2 hashes everything down to 16 bytes using a POLY function that performs prime modulus arithmetics, with the prime changing as the size of the input grows. * Layer 3 hashes the 16-byte string to a fixed length of 4 bytes. This is what one iteration generates. In RFC 4418, NH is rearranged to take a form of: Y = 0 for (i = 0; i < t; i += 8) do Y = Y +_64 ((M_{i+0} +_32 K_{i+0}) *_64 (M_{i+4} +_32 K_{i+4})) Y = Y +_64 ((M_{i+1} +_32 K_{i+1}) *_64 (M_{i+5} +_32 K_{i+5})) Y = Y +_64 ((M_{i+2} +_32 K_{i+2}) *_64 (M_{i+6} +_32 K_{i+6})) Y = Y +_64 ((M_{i+3} +_32 K_{i+3}) *_64 (M_{i+7} +_32 K_{i+7})) end for This definition is designed to encourage programmers to use SIMD instructions on the accumulation, since only data with four indices away are likely to not be put in the same SIMD register, and hence faster to multiply in bulk. On a hypothetical machine, it could simply translate to: movq $0, regY ; Y = 0 movq $0, regI ; i = 0 loop: add reg1, regM, regI ; reg1 = M + i add reg2, regM, regI vldr.4x32 vec1, reg1 ; load 4x32bit vals from memory *reg1 to vec1 vldr.4x32 vec2, reg2 vmul.4x64 vec3, vec1, vec2 ; vec3 = vec1 * vec2 uaddv.4x64 reg3, vec3 ; horizontally sum vec3 into reg3 add regY, regY, reg3 ; regY = regY + reg3 add regI, regI, $8 cmp regI, regT jlt loop See also * Poly1305 is another fast MAC based on strongly universal hashing.

As a student and university teacher, Poyntz espoused many radical causes and went on to become a co- founder of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). Later she began working as an intelligence agent for the Soviet Union, travelling secretly to Moscow just as some of her comrades were being executed in Joseph Stalin's Great Purge, after which she resigned from the party. This is widely assumed to have led to her unexplained disappearance in New York City in June 1937 as the likely victim of an assassination squad, possibly because she had been associating with Trotskyists. Biography Juliet Poyntz was born on November 25, 1886, in Omaha, Nebraska. Her family moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, not long before she entered Barnard College. She was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR). =Education= Poyntz moved to New York City as a young adult, where she earned degrees at Barnard College in 1907. She was class treasurer as a freshman, class president as a sophomore, secretary of the Barnard Union, and finally president of the Undergraduate Association and chairman of the student council as a senior. She served as editor-in-chief of Barnard's Mortarboard yearbook, and was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, the Philosophy Club, the Classical Club, the Athletic Association, the Christian Association, and the Sophomore Dance Committee. In 1904, she acted \\"Casting the Boomerang,\\" at the Brinckerhoff Theatre (now Minor Latham Playhouse). In 1905, Poyntz took part in Barnard's third annual Greek Games, where she recited the \\"Invocation to the Gods\\" and tied first place in wrestling. She partook in the Interclass Debate (class of 1906 versus class of 1907). In her senior year, she was voted most popular both in the college and for 1907. She was valedictorian of her class and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. By graduation in June 1907, her interests had expanded from suffragism and feminism to trade unionism, labor rights, and socialism. =Political career= From 1907 to 1909, Poyntz was \\"Special Agent for the U.S. Immigration Commission,\\" working in Chicago, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Utica (New York), Lawrence (Massachusetts), and other cities. She joined the Socialist Party of America in 1909. She taught at Barnard College for the 1909–1910 academic year, when she was an assistant to history professor James T. Shotwell, who was well known for his liberal and pacifist views. She received her A.M. degree from Columbia University. In 1912, she wrote Barnard's Class Book, \\"I am still a woman's suffragist or worse still a Feminist and also a Socialist (also of the worst brand).\\" She began working in the labor reform movement in 1913. She was instrumental in labor-Left reform organizations such as the US Immigration Commission, the American Association for Labor Legislation, and the Rand School of Social Science. In 1915, she became education director of the Worker's University of Local 25 of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) under committee chair Elias Lieberman. Several other New York locals and the Rand School joined for special courses in trade unionism. In 1917, she became educational director for the entire ILGWU. In 1918, she left the ILGWU. She continued to work within the Socialist Party-oriented ILGWU after siding with the fledgling Communist Party USA. During the 1920s, Poyntz was on the staff of the Friends of the Soviet Union and International Labor Defense. In November 1926, she ran for New York State Comptroller and in November 1928 for New York State Attorney General, both times on the Workers Party ticket. She later quit her outside work in favor of intelligence activities for the Soviet OGPU during the \\"Third Period\\". According to a book by Benjamin Gitlow, a founding member of the CPUSA, Poyntz was a delegate to several consecutive American Communist Party conventions, and was a member of the Party's Central Executive Committee, besides being on New York's District Executive Committee. She had gone to China on a Comintern (Communist International) mission, and had dropped out of the CPUSA in 1934 in order to work for the OGPU (Soviet military secret police) in gathering scientific information for the Soviet Union. In 1936, Poyntz secretly travelled to Moscow to receive further instructions from Soviet authorities, and was seen there in the company of George Mink (alias Minkoff), an American later implicated in the disappearance of several Trotkskyists during the Spanish Civil War.The Mink, Time Magazine, 2 May 1938Pernicone, Nunzio, Carlo Tresca: Portrait of a Rebel, New York: Palgrave MacMillan 2005; pg. 232 While there, Poyntz witnessed the Great Purge instigated by Stalin, in which people she had known and worked with were killed. She returned to the US disillusioned and unwilling to continue spying for the OGPU (later the NKVD). =Disappearance= Poyntz disappeared after leaving the American Woman's Association Clubhouse at 353 West 57th Street in Manhattan, New York City on the evening of June 3, 1937.Kern, Gary, A Death in Washington, p. 163 A police investigation turned up no clues to her fate, and her belongings, all of her clothing, and hand luggage in her room appeared to be untouched which suggested that she had not intended to leave the building for very long.Gitlow, Benjamin, The Whole of Their Lives; Communism in America --a Personal History and Intimate Portrayal of its Leaders, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons (1948) In early 1938, Carlo Tresca, a leading Italian-American anarchist, publicly accused the Soviets of kidnapping Poyntz in order to prevent her defection. He said that before she disappeared, she had come to him to talk over her disgust at what she had seen in Moscow in 1936 in the early stages of Joseph Stalin's Great Purge. Testimony by former Soviet agent Whittaker Chambers tied Poyntz' disappearance to the shadowy Soviet Comintern agent Josef Peters.Whittaker Chambers Testimony before HUAC 3 August 1948 As an inside member of the Soviet Comintern and OGPU espionage network, Peters is believed to have participated in the planning of the kidnapping and alleged murder of fellow CPUSA member Poyntz by a Soviet assassination squad. Chambers later stated that he heard Poyntz had been killed for attempted desertion, and this rumor contributed to his caution when he defected in 1938. Elizabeth Bentley stated she was told by Jacob Golos in the late 1930s, and later by KGB officer Anatoli Gromov in 1945 that Poyntz had been a traitor and was now dead. Both Chambers' and Bentley's defections were probably in part motivated by fear of the example set in the Poyntz case. Author Benjamin Gitlow wrote that Poyntz was disillusioned by Stalin's purges and was unwilling to continue as an espionage agent for the USSR. Gitlow relates that the OGPU/NKVD used Poyntz's former lover, a man named Shachno Epstein, the associate editor of the Communist Yiddish daily Morgen Freiheit (and an OGPU/NKVD agent himself), to lure Poyntz out for a walk in Central Park. \\"They met at Columbus Circle and proceeded to walk through Central Park...Shachno took her by the arm and led her up a side path, where a large black limousine hugged the edge of the walk ... Two men jumped out, grabbed Miss Poyntz, shoved her into the car and sped away.\\" Gitlow relates that the assassins took Poyntz to the woods near the Roosevelt estate in Dutchess County, and killed and buried her there. \\"The body was covered with lime and dirt. On top were placed dead leaves and branches which the three killers trampled down with their feet.\\" Before his own mysterious death, the GRU defector Walter Krivitsky suggested another motive for the NKVD kidnapping of Poyntz. During one of her sojourns in Moscow, Poyntz had become a lover of Red Army Corps Commander Vitovt Putna. In August 1936, the NKVD arrested Putna and accused him of maintaining contacts with Leon Trotsky, from whom he had allegedly received \\"terrorist directives.\\" Under torture, Putna testified to the existence of a \\"nation-wide\\" center of Trotskyists, and to his involvement in a \\"parallel\\" military organization. On June 11, 1937, a military tribunal, in camera, condemned Putna and other high- ranking officers to death in the judicial frame-up known as the Moscow Trial of the Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization. The NKVD, according to Krivitsky, may have abducted Poyntz one week before the trial out of fear that she would defect once the execution of Putna became known, or simply because she was a known friend of the \\"enemy\\" Putna.Walter Krivitsky FBI FOIA File 100-11146-84 Personal lifeMarriage= In 1913, Poyntz married Dr. Friedrich Franz Ludwig Glaser, a communist and attache at the German consulate in New York. She kept her maiden name, although she changed the spelling from \\"Points\\" to \\"Poyntz\\".

It is located south of the Byrranga Mountains. Geography Lake Taymyr is large, with a length of 165 km roughly east-to-west. It has an irregular shape with many arms projecting in different directions that cover a wide region. Its maximum width, however, is only about 23 km in its broadest area which is towards the eastern end of the lake. Lake Taymyr is covered with ice from late September until June. The main river flowing into its basin, from the west, is the Upper Taymyra. Other rivers flowing into it are the Zapadnaya, Severnaya, Bikada-Nguoma, Yamu-Tarida and Kalamissamo. The Lower Taymyra flows out of the lake northwards across the Byrranga mountain region. The tundra areas south of Lake Taymyr are full of smaller lakes and marshes. There are two quite large lakes east and southeast of the easternmost part of Lake Taymyr, which is Yamuneru Bay: 33 km east is Lake Kungusalakh, and 72 km southeast is Lake Portnyagino. Both lakes are about 20 km across. Ecology Lake Taymyr is teeming with many kinds of fish typical of cold Arctic waters, like loach, sig, and muksun.

Although these systems were originally implemented by manual index card methods, since the late 1970s they have exploited the efficiency and speed of digital computers. They are essential tools for broadcasting by music radio stations. These systems are databases of the songs in active rotation at a radio station, plus an ample set of rules for sequencing them in accordance with specific policies. For example, there may be restrictions on how much time must pass between two songs by the same artist, or whether a song played during noontime today may be heard at noontime tomorrow (or not). There are also rules for what kinds of songs may succeed another according to tempos or other characteristics. Many people believe that disc jockeys at radio stations are responsible for choosing the music which is heard on their shows. In reality, playlists for each hour of the day have usually been generated in advance by a radio station's program director using a music scheduling system. This ensures that the station programming is optimal and adheres to the policies and objectives of the station's management. These policies and objectives are usually designed to please the greatest number of people inside the radio station's demographic target, and garner the best ratings possible for the radio station. However, there are some radio stations, for example those of BBC, which do allow most (but not all) disc jockeys to choose the music themselves without obligations, as these stations cover an eclectic range of genres. In addition, shows from resident/guest disc jockeys (particularly on mainstream stations) also do not need the program director's opinion for their playlists. Music scheduling is simply the function of generating a playlist. Other systems are responsible for actually reproducing the music. The first widely used commercial music scheduler for radio is Selector, originally written by Dr. Andrew Economos of Radio Computing Services, Inc, in 1979. A-ware MusicMaster (called Musicscan at the time) followed in 1983. The third most commonly used music scheduler, Powergold, was released in 1988. Today, Selector, MusicMaster and PowerGold are the three most widely used music scheduling applications in broadcasting. Scheduling, in the general radio broadcasting sense, is the placement of content against a linear timeline for transmission on a broadcast station. This content may include not only music, but also commercial advertisements, station identifiers and promotional jingles. Commercial advertisements, called spots in radio lingo, are scheduled by their own separate scheduling system, called a 'traffic system' which keeps track of monetary considerations. The music schedule, non-music schedule (jingles, promos) and the commercial schedule are later merged into a single schedule (called the log) to guide what must be played on the station on a minute-by-minute basis. When considering the internet as a new broadcast medium, the definition of scheduling could be broadened \\"to curate or arrange a linear playlist of video/audio content for live transmission or on-demand distribution.\\" This would apply to both internet distribution and traditional broadcasting.

The screenplay, written by Scott Rosenberg, follows a group of high school outcasts who are horrified by their \\"Blue Ribbon\\" classmates who are part of an elaborate mind control experiment, and was compared unfavorably by most critics to the 1975 thriller, The Stepford Wives. The film was directed by David Nutter, who was a director and producer of The X-Files as well as a director and co-executive producer of Millennium. Plot Steve Clark (James Marsden) is a high school senior whose family moves to Cradle Bay, a picturesque island community in Washington state's Puget Sound. It has been nearly one year since Steve's older brother, Allen (Ethan Embry), committed suicide, which traumatized the family. During Steve's first day at his new high school, he meets and befriends three outcast students, Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl), Gavin's friend, U.V. (Chad Donella) and Rachel \\"Rae\\" Wagner (Katie Holmes). Gavin tries to tell Steve that he believes there is something evil about the \\"Blue Ribbons\\" - a clique of students taking part in a \\"special program\\" led by the school psychologist, Dr. Edgar Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood). Later that day, Steve witnesses a fight in class between a rebellious student, Dickie Atkinson (Tygh Runyan) and one of the Blue Ribbons. Dickie is later accosted at a secluded marina by the Blue Ribbons. He later reappears at school as a clean-cut Blue Ribbon and assists in smashing up his once-prized muscle car in front of the students. Steve goes to a local yogurt shop to meet Gavin, but the Blue Ribbons, keen to befriend him, invite him to sit with them. Gavin arrives to meet Steve, and takes him outside after a tense exchange with the group. Gavin shows Steve a photograph of himself and several of his friends, who were transformed into Blue Ribbons. The two eavesdrop on a parents meeting, where Gavin learns his parents have signed him up for Caldicott's program. Steve remains skeptical of Gavin's fears of the Blue Ribbons and the program, and wrestles a gun Gavin produces, which he planned to use against his expected abductors. The following day at lunch, Gavin walks in with his hair cut, and looking like a Blue Ribbon. When Steve tries to confront Gavin, he gets punched in the stomach for his impertinence. Later, after being chased home, Steve finds Blue Ribbon member Lorna Longley (Crystal Cass) in his living room, waiting up after tutoring Steve's younger sister Lindsay (Katharine Isabelle). She goes to use the bathroom, then emerges, partially undressed, and forcefully kisses Steve. Her heightened arousal causes her right eye to glow red, startling Steve. Lorna then starts chanting: \\"Wrong, bad!\\" and then smashes her head into a mirror, attacks Steve with a mirror shard, and then leaves the house. She is later seen undergoing treatment at a medical facility under Dr. Caldicott's direction. He insists to Lorna's parents that the brain implant where the pituitary gland and right eye are works, and she needed a new one. During this time, Steve also befriends Dorian (William Sadler), the school janitor, who appears to be mentally disabled and hunts rats for the city for some extra cash. Dorian demonstrates a device called an E-Rat-icator which emits a soft, high pitched whine that is supposed to be innocuous but annoying to rats. Dorian tells Steve that he suspects that the entire community of Cradle Bay is part of a massive conspiracy made up of nearly all of the parents, the local police chief, the school principal and entire school faculty, who hired Dr. Caldicott to \\"reprogram\\" their own children to become the perfect people that they want them to be and not rebellious teenagers. Rachel finds a CD-R disc that Gavin hid in the school's boiler room, containing a video he made of himself before his \\"transformation\\", telling about the history of the club and Caldicott's background. A Blue Ribbon known as \\"Chug\\" (A.J. Buckley) attempts to rape Rachel in the basement, when Dorian's E-Rat-icator goes off, and immediately sends Chug into an agonized frenzy, during which Rachel slips away. Chug smashes the E-Rat-cator and walks out, apparently oblivious to what has just occurred. During their personal investigation, Steve and Rachel try to find out what exactly has been happening to the Blue Ribbon kids, which leads them to a mental hospital called Bishop Flats following a lead on the disc. They find out that mind control is being used to make unruly teens become perfect so they can function properly in life, but the programming has some glitches that lead to momentary relapses and violent fits. They also find Caldicott's own daughter, Betty (Julie Patzwald), a failed project who appears to have been lobotomized by her father's experiments. After escaping from the hospital, Steve and Rachel return to Cradle Bay to plan to rescue Lindsay and Gavin's friend, U.V. before fleeing town. They have a run-in with the town's police chief Cox (Steve Railsback) who is also involved in the conspiracy. He tries to arrest them for being out after curfew, but Dorian shows up under the pretense that he is disposing of dead rats, then knocks out the police chief and frees Steve and Rachel, telling them to leave town and go public with what they know. When Rachel and Steve return to Steve's home to get Lindsay, Steve's parents reveal that they moved to Cradle Bay to sign him up for the program. A group of Blue Ribbons ambush them and drag Steve and Rachel to the programming center. Steve grabs a scalpel before being strapped into a chair. Before the reprogramming can start, Steve uses the scalpel to cut his bonds and rescue Rachel, and killing the medical techs. On the way out, they encounter Chug, who attacks Steve. Rachel bludgeons Chug to death, saving Steve. Exiting what turns out to be the town hospital's basement, Steve and Rachel are met by Lindsay and U.V. in Rachel's truck. Rushing to catch the early ferry, they meet with a roadblock made of Blue Ribbons and Caldicott on the road. When hope seems lost, Dorian drives up, striking Caldicott, and activating multiple E-Rat-icators that scramble the mind control tech inside the Blue Ribbons' heads. They chase after Dorian and try to destroy the E-Rat- icators. Steve tells U.V. to drive Lindsay and Rachel to the ferry and follows Dorian on a motorcycle. Dorian, having been fatally wounded by a gunshot from Caldicott, and believing the Blue Ribbons to be beyond help, drives his car off a cliff with most of the Blue Ribbons hanging onto it. A final battle ensues between Steve and Caldicott, which Steve wins by kicking Caldicott off the cliff. Steve then rides the motorcycle to the ferry, where he and Rachel reunite with a kiss. They then leave Cradle Bay on the ferry with Lindsay and U.V. to begin a new life without their parents. The final scene shows a classroom in an urban high school with kids playing loud music, cursing, and acting up. They are informed that they have a new student teacher. The well- groomed teacher turns around after writing on the board and is revealed to be Gavin, with the Blue Ribbon \\"red twinkle\\" still active in his right eye.

As of January 2019, the film held a \\"rotten\\" 34% rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, receiving 25 negative reviews out of 38. In spite of the disappointing reviews, Disturbing Behavior was a moderate success at the box office. The film opened at No. 7 at the North American box office making $7 million USD in its opening weekend. It had a 57% decline in earnings the following week, falling to No. 12. Alternate versions After filming was completed and director David Nutter edited his director's cut, MGM took the film away from him and had several different versions re-edited and shown to test audiences. Eventually, an 83 minutes long version was the one selected for theatrical release. Many cut scenes from the film focused more on plot and character development. Cuts made to the film were so severe that Nutter thought about having his name removed from the credits. Although a director's cut was never released, there is a fan edit version of the film available, which runs 103 minutes and uses the DVD's deleted scenes, including the film's original ending. A few other deleted scenes were not released, while the real director's cut ran 115 minutes.Medic, Bill (2014-10). Disturbing Behavior: A Fresh Hero Makes the Difference. The Pro-Youth Pages, October 2014. Retrieved from http://www.proyouthpages.com/disturbingbehavior.html. The DVD release features eleven deleted scenes featuring more story and character development, as well as a love scene between Steve and Rachel, never used in the theatrical release, but present in the theatrical trailer. Scenes include a conversation between Dorian and Steve, in which Dorian explains how a crash that killed four drunken teens, a mother and her young child devastated the town and made them receptive to Caldicott's plan; a conversation between Steve and Rachel on the ferry, in which he tells the circumstances behind his brother's suicide; a ride Steve gets from Officer Cox after being chased by the Blue Ribbons and before encountering Lorna at his house; and Steve's mother finding a gun (confiscated from Gavin) hidden under Steve's mattress, which prompts them to bring in Caldicott. Also included is an alternate ending where Gavin meets a different fate than the one used in the theatrical release, and the revelation that Caldicott's program is assisted by a shadowy organization seeking a \\"prototype\\". In the film commentary, the director complains that he objected to particular scenes being removed, but that the producers overrode his objections. In certain versions of the theatrical release, the two aforementioned conversations did stay included. The United States cable networks Syfy Universal and Comet (TV network) have been known to air a somewhat unofficial director's cut of the film, with the deleted scenes reinstated, although the film is still shown with the theatrical ending.\\"https://www.comettv.com/program- details/Feature+Film/Disturbing+Behavior/21446/Horror/MV000614940000/\\" =Love scene= As they are leaving Bishop Flats, Steve makes the decision to return to Cradle Bay to rescue his sister, which upsets Rachel, who then tells Steve that all her ambitions of escaping Cradle Bay and going to college have now evaporated with their new revelations about the Blue Ribbon program, and implores him to simply escape with her. When he insists on returning for his sister, Rachel relents and goes with him. On the ferry back to Cradle Bay, Steve and Rachel use the time to have sex in Rachel's truck. The scene can be found on the original 2000 DVD release by MGM. =Alternate ending= After defeating Callicott, Steve gets on the ferry, and discovers his friends held up at gunpoint by Gavin, and it turns out he wasn't affected by the E-rat- acator, because he was wearing his headphones. Still trying to be his friend, Steve pleads with Gavin that they need to get him some help. Gavin refuses on the false belief that everything helped him without the realization of the program's effects which cause him to react. He tries to shoot Steve with a shotgun and UV shoots him three times with the gun that Steve took away from him. As he lies dying on the ground, Gavin escapes out of his hypnosis to chastise a heartbroken UV (for not being able to kill him in fewer than three shots) while the others tend to him. His dying words are a sarcastic remark that his death will prevent him from meeting his pre-transformation idol, Trent Reznor. Despite having survived the events that preceded them, the group is reminded that they still lost a friend in the process as everyone starts to tear up.

It takes its name from the city in Massachusetts, which early settlers felt bore a resemblance to the area. HistoryEarly settlement= Brookline was a part of the larger West Liberty Borough before its absorption into Pittsburgh in 1908. Early in its history, the area was mostly inhabited by miners and farmers. At the turn of the century, when the mining industry in the area declined, only farms were left. =Dawn of the 20th century= The dawn of the 20th century brought many technological advances that helped the South Hills of Pittsburgh flourish. First, the transportation of coal from the area opened up the Pittsburgh & Castle Shannon Railroad Co. to install lines going to the area. This included a tunnel to be bored from downtown Pittsburgh, through Mt. Washington, and to exit right above South Hills Junction. With the age of automobiles looming, a few decades later the Liberty Tunnel was completed. This helped create a boom in the South Hills areas. =Trolley service= Brookline was linked by streetcar to downtown Pittsburgh in 1905 by Pittsburgh Railways who built a single line south along West Liberty Avenue, turning east on a private right of way and then following Brookline Boulevard to Saw Mill Run. This initial line was cut back to Edgebrook Avenue a year later, but in 1909 the track was doubled and a loop put in near the end of Witt Street. In 1915 the line was extended south along West Liberty Avenue to Dormont where it linked with the 42 Dormont line. The 39 Brookline service closed in 1966. Surrounding communities Brookline has seven borders, including the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Beechview to the northeast, Bon Air to the northwest, Carrick to the east and Overbrook to the southeast. The remaining borders are with Baldwin Township to the south, Mt. Lebanon to the southwest and Dormont to the west.

It is a third-person action-adventure shooter which parodies both other games and several other media such as The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail, using humorous in-game dialogue and cutscenes. The game features known actors and voice actors such as Brian George as main hero Roman, Jeff Bennett, John Mariano and Pat Fraley as his sidekicks Jonesy, Rexus and Q (respectively) and Tony Jay as villain King Forge. Gameplay Armed and Dangerous is a third-person shooter action game, the camera hovering behind Roman, the player character, at all times. The game is played mostly on foot, with most levels incorporating usable gun emplacements, although there are some base defense levels where the player is inside a movable gun turret mounted on rails on top of a defensive wall; these levels are played in first-person. Playable weaponry and equipment in Armed and Dangerous is a mix of shooter staples, including bolt-action and sniper rifles, submachine guns and rocket launchers, but also more unusual fare like the 'Land Shark Gun', which fires into the ground a rapidly maturing infant Land Shark, a creature that 'swims' through the earth, seeking out and devouring enemies. Other unusual devices include a miniature black hole, a gas grenade that turns enemies against each other, and a device that temporarily reverses gravity, causing enemies to 'fall' into the sky and literally turning the world upside-down before the device shuts down, returning gravity to normal and returning affected enemies to earth, killing them by the fall. Apart from weaponry, some of the later levels equip the player with a jet pack, allowing flight over moderate distances. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on both platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Backwards compatibility  On November 28, 2007, Microsoft released the backward compatibility update for the Xbox 360 which allows Xbox 360 owners to play the Xbox disc version of Armed and Dangerous. On June 10, 2019, Microsoft announced the ending of the backward compatibility program for the Xbox One for both Xbox Original and 360 titles.

Established in 1854, it is one of the oldest engineering colleges in India, after College of Engineering, Guindy, Chennai (1794) and IIT Roorkee (1847). The students and alumni of College of Engineering, Pune are colloquially referred to as COEPians.  History  The main building of COEP which houses the administrative wing The college was one of the first few colleges established by the British to serve the Indian subcontinent. The foundation stone of the new college was laid by the Governor of Bombay, Sir Bartle Frere, who was to become the Vice- Chancellor of the University, on 5 August 1865. In June of the following year, Theodore Cooke M.A., was appointed the Principal. He went on to hold the office for next 28 years. The foundation stone Initially, it was started on 16 December 1854, to train public works department (PWD) officials and was housed in three bungalows as the 'Poona Engineering and Mechanical School' to train subordinate officers for carrying out public works like buildings, dams, canals, railways and bridges. In July 1857, Henry Coke was given the charge of the institute. Admission was open to all, irrespective of nationality or caste. Good proficiency in English and basic knowledge of Mathematics were a prerequisite for getting admitted to the institute. The process of admission required that the aspiring candidate apply to the nearest government English school, to whom the entrance examination papers were handed over. The headmaster would take the examination on a date deemed convenient to him and submit the answer sheets to Henry Coke, the in-charge of the mechanical school. After examining the papers, Coke would notify the headmaster of the school with the names of candidates who were deemed fit for admission. Scholarships of 6 were offered per month after a period of six months of training in the mechanical school for fifteen students. The courses offered included Mathematics, Drawing, Surveying and levelling, building and construction and setting out works on the ground. The course would run for a period of two years. Later on, in the year 1864, the school became the \\"Poona Civil Engineering College\\". The number of courses were increased to include forestry and agricultural subjects, which led to its name being changed to Poona College of Science. The college was inaugurated at the new premises on 5 August 1865, at the hands of then governor Sir Bertel Ferre. It started a course in licensed and civil engineering (LCE) and trained masons and overseers. Later it secured affiliation to the Bombay university. The course was revised in 1886 and the minimum criteria required for admission was raised from Matriculation to the then Previous Examination. In 1909, the LCE was converted into the BE degree and the first batch of students passed out in 1912. The name 'Government college of engineering, Pune' was taken up only in 1911. All non-engineering courses were stopped by 1911, transferring the Bachelor of Science degree to the Science Institute of Bombay and subsequently in the year 1911, the name was changed to the \\"Government College of Engineering, Poona\\". Photos of Coep during the early 20th century The institution was initially affiliated to the University of Bombay (now Mumbai) for a degree of Licentiate in Civil Engineering known as LCE in 1858. The certificate course was converted into a degree course and the first class of the Bachelor of Engineering degree graduated in the year 1912. After the University of Poona (now Savitribai Phule Pune University) was established in 1948, the college became affiliated to the new university. In 1968, the three- year degree was extended to 4 years constituting 8 semesters. In 2003, the institute was granted complete autonomy by the State Government of Maharashtra, thus giving it the freedom to set its own curriculum and manage its own finances. With permanent affiliation to the Savitribai Phule Pune University, the institute now is an autonomous engineering school. This has been the biggest change as far as pedagogy at COEP is concerned. The following years have seen a multitude of positive changes in administration and academic strategies. Many of these have been responsible for the growing innovation in project work of college students. The institute contends that its autonomy now grants it greater flexibility in dynamically changing its syllabus to suit the changing needs of the industry.  Accreditation  The National Board of Accreditation, has accredited all programmes under Tier-2 (General) status for a period of 5 years from 2012. In the year 2014, 9 undergraduate programmes were accredited with tier-1 (Washington Accord) status. This particular accreditation gives way to recognition of the quality of undergraduate engineering education offered by the member country and is an avenue to bring it into the world class category. It encourages and facilitates the mobility of engineering graduates and professionals at international level. The tier-1 accreditation is effective from 01/07/2014 for a period of five years.  Architecture The Main Hall= The main hall is the present day administrative building of the College. It houses the Director, the Dean Academic Affairs, the Dean Student Affairs, the Gymkhana, the Examination cell and other various important administrative heads of the college. The original building was almost three floors tall with a base floor length of 18 meters and a width of 9 metres. The hall was recently refurbished and the inauguration of the restored heritage building (pictured below) took place on 24 March 2012 by Sharad Pawar, Minister of Agriculture, Government of India.  Admissions  Undergraduate = Undergraduate admissions to the College of Engineering, Pune are competitive and are based on merit. Earlier admissions were based upon the percentage of science subjects' marks secured in Higher Secondary Certificate exam of Maharashtra state and later on the basis of marks scored in Maharashtra Common Entrance Test. However, at present the admissions are conducted on the basis of the marks secured in Maharashtra CET and HSC board combined. These admissions are conducted by the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) through the Centralized Admission Process (CAP). Affirmative action programs exist for students belonging to socially and economically backward classes as stipulated in the Constitution of India and various statutes. There are programs for students from north-eastern India and Indian citizens from Kashmir. There are also programs for children of people working in Gulf countries, foreign nationals, foreign students and Person of Indian Origin (PIO) in the college. Non-Resident Indians can also apply for the courses. For the year 2015–16 this quota is applicable for admissions to Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli and Laxminarayan Institute of Technology. The reservations for different categories are based on the Government of India and Government of Maharashtra rules. Reservations in seats are provided for SC (Schedule Caste), ST (Schedule Tribes), NT (Nomadic Tribes), OBC (Other Backward Classes), PH (Physically Handicapped) as well as female candidates. It has been included in the Guinness Book of world records, several admissions to direct second year of BTech course are also conducted for those candidates who have completed Diploma in Engineering at different polytechnic institutes in the state of Maharashtra. These admissions are conducted through the Centralized Admission Process (CAP) by DTE itself. = Postgraduate and Doctorate = Postgraduate admissions to the College of Engineering, Pune are also on merit basis.

Controversies  Land acquisition = In December 2005 the Pune Municipal Corporation asked the college for some of its land for road widening. This led to considerable outrage amongst students, and the issue was under heated debate. It was pointed out that the college was classified as a 'heritage complex' by the state government. = Renaming = 1854–1870: Poona Engineering Class and Mechanical School 1871–1911: Government Science College (Agriculture and Botany Classes) 1911–2003: Government College of Engineering, Pune 2003–2006: Pune Institute of Engineering and Technology 2006 onwards: College of Engineering, Pune In 2000, COEP claimed independence from the state government and was declared an autonomous institute in 2003. Considerable confusion ensued over a proposed name change from COEP to Pune Institute of Engineering and Technology (PIET) which was strongly opposed by alumni and students. The newly autonomous entity's name was rolled back to COEP in November 2005. = Road widening and flyover construction = The College was at loggerheads with the Pune Municipal Corporation over the proposed construction of a flyover in front of the college, that would not only deface the renovated Main Hall but would also encroach upon the College's premises. The College and its alumni were of the opinion that the flyover would not, in any way, decongest the traffic plying through that road. It also considered the flyover as serious danger to the safety of the pedestrians, including students, as it was not considered in the plan of the flyover.

George Washington lived there while he was in command of the Continental Army during the final year of the American Revolutionary War; it had the longest tenure as his headquarters of any place he had used. In 1961 the house was designated a state historic site. It is also the oldest house in the city of Newburgh, and the first property acquired and preserved by any U.S. state for historic reasons. History Engraving of Washington headquarters, 1777 The first fieldstone farmhouse on the site may have been built in 1725 by Burger Mynderse. The property was sold to Elsie Hasbrouck, and she in turn gave it to her son, Jonathan, who married Catherine (Tryntje) Dubois and they built the existing structure on the original foundation, if any, in 1750. The house was surrounded by a large stock farm. The home underwent two significant enlargements before it was completed in 1770. The home has an original \\"Dutch Jambless\\" fireplace. A temporary kitchen was built by the Continental Army upon their arrival in 1782. Other changes were made inside the house including the addition of an \\"English\\" style fireplace in General Washington's bedroom. Existing buildings such as stables and barns were also enlarged and improved on the site. Most Army buildings were removed by the Quartermaster-General's Office at the end of the war, with the exception of a \\"House in the garden\\", which was given to Mrs. Hasbrouck. It no longer exists. In 1850, it was acquired by the State of New York and became the first publicly operated historic site in the country. Today, it is a museum furnished to recreate its condition during the Revolutionary War. It covers an area of about seven acres (2.8 ha), with three buildings: Hasbrouck House, a museum (built in 1910), a monument named the \\"Tower of Victory\\", which was completed in 1890 after four years of construction in order to commemorate the centennial of Washington's stay, and a maintenance shed/garage built in the Colonial Revival style in 1942. Also on the property is the grave of Uzal Knapp, one of the longest- lived veterans of the Continental Army. For many years it was believed that he had served as one of Washington's personal guards, but more recently historians have come to doubt this.Godfrey, Carlos E. The Commander-in-Chief's Guard, Washington, DC, 1906 There is a statue entitled \\"The Minuteman\\", by Henry Hudson Kitson, that was erected on the grounds on November 11, 1924. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961. The Tower of Victory in 2006 Washington's headquarters Hasbrouck House served as Washington's headquarters during the Revolutionary War from April 1782 until August 1783. It was chosen for its comparatively safe location north of the strategically important West Point. Washington established his headquarters here on Sunday, March 31, 1782.Godfrey, 1904, p. 81 The 7,000 troops of the Continental Army were encamped near what is today known as Vails Gate, a few miles to the southwest. In the headquarters at Hasbrouck House, Washington rejected the Newburgh letter, a suggestion to institute an American monarchy, and defused the Newburgh conspiracy and threat of a mutiny among his officers over pay and pensions. On August 7, 1782, while the Continental troops were encamped around the vicinity of the House, Washington issued his first proclamation, a general order which established a Badge of Military Merit, to enlisted men and non- commissioned officers for long and faithful service and for acts of heroism, which was the forerunner of the Purple Heart. His headquarters was the first place the badge of merit was awarded to American troops. Washington left the Newburgh headquarters on the morning of August 31 and moved the army to Verplanck's point where they arrived that evening.Godfrey, 1904, p. 82 On April 19, 1783, after returning to Newburgh, Washington issued an order for the \\"cessation of hostilities\\", and gave his Proclamation of Peace, which formally ended the fighting of the Revolutionary War.Grizzard, pp. 236-37 Honors and commemoration Washington's HQ depicted on 1933 U.S. commemorative stamp Washington's headquarters are featured on the flag of the city of Newburgh. On July 4, 1850 Major General Winfield Scott raised a flag at the opening ceremony and dedication for Washington's headquarters.Schenkman, p. 74 The U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative stamp featuring an accurate depiction of Washington's Headquarters at Hasbrouck House, overlooking the Hudson River, at Newburgh, New York, on April 19, 1933, the 150th anniversary of the proclamation of peace, issued by Washington in his headquarters, which officially ended the Revolutionary War in 1783.

He also played \\"Coconut Head\\" on Nickelodeon's Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide. He attended William S. Hart High School, in Santa Clarita, California, a city located north of Los Angeles. He was in Extreme Movie with Ryan Pinkston (no relation) and Frankie Muniz. Rob currently serves as a StarPower Ambassador for the Starlight Children's Foundation, encouraging other young people to commit their time, energy and resources to help other individuals and working with Starlight to brighten the lives of seriously ill people. CareerPunk'd= He appeared on Punk'd for the first time when he played a troubled youth in whose apparent fight with his aunt in a parking lot tennis player Serena Williams became involved. After Pinkston stole his aunt's car, Williams helped her pursue Rob until Ashton Kutcher revealed himself, and the situation, as a practical joke. On MTV's Punk'd for season 4 episode 3, (Faison helped A] he cried in Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, Kutcher set up a prank on Braff). It all started when Faison went up to Kutcher and said \\"Listen, we got to get Zach Braff.\\" He later successfully tricked Braff with the help of Rob Pinkston. Pinkston acted like a juvenile delinquent. He asked Scrubs' stars Donald Faison and Zach Braff to buy beer. When both Braff and Faison refuse, Pinkston and his friends spray-painted on Braff's brand new $100,000 Porsche until Braff and Faison caught them red handed. Braff was enraged against Pinkston, until Kutcher with two of the kids, revealed himself to Braff, saying, \\"I saw the whole thing goes down, and I got these two!\\" Pinkston played a fan of Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki, who asked him to sign an authentic Jersey from Reebok, and then a number of other memorabilia. When he asked Nowitzki to sign Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James' Jersey and two Lakers' hats. Nowitzki signed some of the memorabilia until Michael Finley (Dirk's teammate, who is now retired) and his trainer Al told him to say no. When Nowitzki refused to sign more non-Dallas Mavericks goods, Pinkston insulted Nowitzki and his teammates. After Pinkston asked Nowitzki to sign the menu, Nowitzki was shocked that the menu says: \\"Hey Dirk! You've been Punk'd!\\" Dirk laughed off the joke. On another episode, Pinkston walked into a clothing store, and met musician Joss Stone, nervous because he can't find his mom. Pinkston fled the store after destroying an expensive statue, after which a nervous Stone told one of the store's employees (also a prankster) that she would pay for the statue. Pinkston then returned with the production's cameras and revealed the joke to Stone. =Other appearances= In 2004, Pinkston played \\"Coconut Head\\" on Nickelodeon's Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide. He got the role in January 2004 on his 16th birthday. Rob appeared as Coconut Head in almost every episode, the only recurring actor to do so. Also in 2005, Rob had a starring role in the feature film, The Derby Stallion along with a young Zac Efron. Rob also has a starring role in The Sasquatch Gang, a feature film produced by Jeremy Coon and written/directed by Napoleon Dynamites Tim Skousen, which was set to be released in 2006, but hasn't been released because the studio that bought the movie, was bought by another company. The movie was released in the fall of 2007. Pinkston also appeared in the third season Ben 10 episode, \\"Under Wraps\\", as Todd, the farm boy.

Its name derives from the fact that it was first identified in the salivary glands of the octopus. In many types of invertebrates octopamine is an important neurotransmitter and hormone. In protostomes — arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worms — it substitutes for norephinephrine and performs functions apparently similar to those of norepinephrine in mammals, functions that have been described as mobilizing the body and nervous system for action. In mammals octopamine is found only in trace amounts, and no biological function has been solidly established for it. It is also found naturally in numerous plants, including bitter orange. Octopamine has been sold under trade names such as Epirenor, Norden, and Norfen for use as a sympathomimetic drug, available by prescription. FunctionsCellular effects= Octopamine exerts its effects by binding to and activating receptors located on the surface of cells. These receptors have mainly been studied in insects, where they can be divided into three types: alpha-adrenergic-like (OctαR), which are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic alpha-1 receptors in mammals; beta-adrenergic-like (OctβR), which are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic beta receptors in mammals; and mixed octopamine/tyramine receptors (TyrR), which are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic alpha-2 receptors in mammals. Receptors in the TyrR class, however, are generally more strongly activated by tyramine than by octopamine. In vertebrates no octopamine-specific receptors have been identified. Octopamine binds weakly to receptors for norepinephrine and epinephrine, but it is not clear whether this has any functional significance. It binds more strongly to trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), especially TAAR1. =Invertebrates= Octopamine was first discovered by Italian scientist Vittorio Erspamer in 1948 in the salivary glands of the octopus and has since been found to act as a neurotransmitter, neurohormone and neuromodulator in invertebrates. Although Erspamer discovered its natural occurrence and named it, octopamine had actually existed for many years as a pharmaceutical product. It is widely used in energy-demanding behaviors by all insects, crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, crayfish), and spiders. Such behaviors include flying, egg-laying, and jumping. Octopamine acts as the insect equivalent of norepinephrine and has been implicated in regulating aggression in invertebrates, with different effects on different species. Studies have shown that reducing the neurotransmitter octopamine and preventing coding of tyramine beta hydroxylase (an enzyme that converts tyramine to octopamine) decreases aggression in Drosophila without influencing other behaviors. In insects, octopamine is released by a select number of neurons, but acts broadly throughout the central brain, on all sense organs, and on several non- neuronal tissues. In the thoracic ganglia, octopamine is primarily released by DUM (dorsal unpaired median) and VUM (ventral unpaired median) neurons, which release octopamine onto neural, muscular, and peripheral targets. These neurons are important for mediating energy-demanding motor behaviors, such as escape-induced jumping and flight. For example, the locust DUMeti neuron releases octopamine onto the extensor tibia muscle to increase muscle tension and increase relaxation rate. These actions promote efficient leg muscle contraction for jumping. During flight, DUM neurons are also active and release octopamine throughout the body to synchronize energy metabolism, respiration, muscle activity and flight interneuron activity. Octopamine in locusts is four times more concentrated in the axon than in the soma, and decreases the locust's myogenic rhythm. In the honey bee and fruit fly, octopamine has a major role in learning and memory. In the firefly, octopamine release leads to light production in the lantern. In lobsters, octopamine seems to direct and coordinate neurohormones to some extent in the central nervous system, and it was observed that injecting octopamine into a lobster and crayfish resulted in limb and abdomen extension. Heberlein et al. have conducted studies of alcohol tolerance in fruit flies; they found that a mutation that caused octopamine deficiency also caused lower alcohol tolerance. The emerald cockroach wasp stings the host for its larvae (a cockroach) in the head ganglion (brain). The venom blocks octopamine receptors and the cockroach fails to show normal escape responses, grooming itself excessively. It becomes docile and the wasp leads it to the wasp's den by pulling its antenna like a leash. In the nematode, octopamine is found in high concentrations in adults, decreasing egg-laying and pharyngeal pumping behaviors with an antagonistic effect to serotonin. Octopaminergic nerves in the mollusc may be present in the heart, with high concentrations in the nervous system. In larvae of the oriental armyworm, octopamine is immunologically beneficial, increasing survival rates in high-density populations. =Vertebrates= In vertebrates, octopamine replaces norepinephrine in sympathetic neurons with chronic use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. It may be responsible for the common side effect of orthostatic hypotension with these agents, though there is also evidence that it is actually mediated by increased levels of N-acetylserotonin. One study noted that octopamine might be an important amine that influences the therapeutic effects of inhibitors such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, especially because a large increase in octopamine levels was observed when animals were treated with this inhibitor. Octopamine was positively identified in the urine samples of mammals such as humans, rats, and rabbits treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Very small amounts of octopamine were also found in certain animal tissues. It was observed that within a rabbit's body, the heart and kidney held the highest concentrations of octopamine. Octopamine was found to be 93% eluted by urine within 24 hours of being produced in the body as a byproduct of Iproniazid in rabbits. Pharmacology Octopamine has been sold under trade names such as Epirenor, Norden, and Norfen for use in medicine as a sympathomimetic drug, available by prescription. Very little information exists concerning its clinical usefulness or safety, though. In mammals, octopamine may mobilize the release of fat from adipocytes (fat cells), which has led to its promotion on the internet as a slimming aid. However, the released fat is likely to be promptly taken up into other cells, and there is no evidence that octopamine facilitates weight loss. Octopamine may also increase blood pressure significantly when combined with other stimulants, as in some weight loss supplements. The World Anti-Doping Agency lists octopamine as a banned substance for in competition use, as a \\"specified stimulant\\" on the 2019 Prohibited List.  Insecticides  The octopamine receptor is a target of insecticides, as its blockage leads to decreased cAMP levels. Essential oils can have such a neuro-insecticidal effect, and this octopamine- receptor mechanism is naturally utilized by plants with active insecticidal phytochemicals. Biochemical mechanisms Mammals = Octopamine is one of four primary endogenous agonists of human trace amine-associated receptor 1. = Invertebrates = Octopamine binds to its respective G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to initiate a cell signal transduction pathway. At least three groups of octopamine GPCR have been defined. OctαR (OCTOPAMINE1 receptors) are more closely related to α-adrenergic receptors, while OctβR (OCTOPAMINE2 receptors) are more closely related to β-adrenergic receptors. The Octopamine/Tyramine receptors (including Oct-TyrR) can bind both ligands, and display agonist-specific coupling. Oct-TyrR is listed in both OCTOPAMINE and TYRAMINE RECEPTORS gene groups.Group : OCTOPAMINE RECEPTORS\\", FlyBase, October 16, 2018.

Career Jackie Vernon was born Ralph Verrone on March 29, 1924 in New York City. Vernon was known for his gentle, low-key delivery and self- deprecating humor. He has been hailed as \\"The King of Deadpan.\\" His signature opening line was, \\"To look at me now, it's hard to believe I was once considered a dull guy.\\" Early in the 1950s, according to Dick Brooks, Vernon bounced around the country working whatever stand-up comedy jobs he could find, mostly in strip joints. Even then he had a unique style, often cracking up members of the band with his inside humor. He decided to give New York a try, and hung around Hanson's Drug Store, a place where small-time comedians and acts in the theater section of New York would meet after making the rounds of agents who had their offices in the area. He was picked up by manager of comedian Willie Weber. In 1963, Steve Allen invited Jackie to appear on his late-night television show, Celebrity Talent Scouts, and his career went into overdrive. In the 1960s, Jackie occasionally worked as the opening act for both Dean Martin and Judy Garland and was a regular fixture on The Merv Griffin Show, where he informed the host that his original stage name had been \\"Nosmo King,\\" which he had seen on a sign (i.e. \\"no smoking\\"). He would take up a topic like prisons in a monologue and begin with, \\"Hello, prison fans.\\" Vernon was also known to perform unique and darker sketches, such as his ultimately tragic attempt to turn a watermelon into a housepet. Plagued by strange occurrences and misfortune, Jackie would tell of traveling all the way to see the Grand Canyon, only to find it was closed. Then there was the time he went to see a fistfight, and it broke out into a hockey game. One of his early bits was the \\"Vacation Slide Show.\\" There were no slides visible; they were presumably offscreen as he described them, using a hand-clicker to advance to each \\"slide\\": :(click) Here I am, tossing coins at the toll booth. :(click) Here I am, under the car, looking for the coins. :(click) Here I am, picking up a hitchhiker. :(click) Here I am, hitchhiking. :(click) Here's the hitchhiker picking me up with my own car. Luckily, she didn't recognize me. A typical joke of Vernon's: \\"We lived in a small town built on a one-way street. If you miss it you have to drive all the way around the world to get back\\" Vernon was once a trumpet player and often carried a cornet with him as a prop during his stand-up routines. As with Henny Youngman and his violin, it was seldom actually played. When he guested on a summer variety program hosted by Al Hirt in 1965, he came on with his cornet and said, \\"I play like I'm Hirt.\\" He was a popular figure on The Ed Sullivan Show and other variety shows, where he often ended his act by blowing a cornet and saying, \\"I think I hurt myself!\\" He often appeared on the \\"Celebrity Roasts\\" that were a staple of 1970s television, as well as being a fixture on the dais at the original live Friars Club Roasts before and after the televised versions. Vernon's signature \\"deadpan\\" expression and delivery often had the roast audiences laughing hysterically, long before the punch line of the jokes. On December 6, 1972, one of Vernon's recorded concerts was released which was titled Sex Is Not Hazardous To Your Health, a record album recording of his first stand-up routine of sex jokes. Vernon's X-rated story-style jokes about people engaging in extreme sexual depravity became legend, often with the added tag line, \\"and I thought to myself... what a neat guy!\\" Vernon also memorably starred in Wayne Berwick's 1983 cult film Microwave Massacre, in which he plays a lascivious construction builder who kills his wife for bossing him around and making him too many microwaved \\"gourmet\\" meals. =Charlie Chaplin= Vernon said that for the first few years after starting standup in the 1950s, he would write letters to his hero Charlie Chaplin, although he never got a reply or any acknowledgement of his letter-writing. After Vernon became famous and was making TV appearances, he eventually stopped writing to Chaplin. During an appearance in Las Vegas, management told him that Charlie Chaplin would be in the audience that night; Jackie asked if he could meet Chaplin. He was told that Chaplin was eating dinner right then in the restaurant. Vernon walked up to Chaplin's table, and as he started to introduce himself, Chaplin interrupted him, saying, \\"Of course, Jackie Vernon. Tell me: why did you stop writing?\\" =Frosty the Snowman= Despite his reputation as a raunchy comedian, Vernon also supplied the voice of the title character of the popular Rankin-Bass television special Frosty the Snowman (1969), which has been broadcast annually on CBS since its debut. He later voiced Frosty in two more Rankin-Bass specials; Frosty's Winter Wonderland (1976) and Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July (1979). Personal life Vernon was married to Hazel Sawyer, together they have three children; David, Lisa, and Tracey. Death Jackie Vernon died at his home in Hollywood, California, on November 10, 1987, from a heart attack at age 63. Vernon's wife, Hazel, died 19 years later on April 13, 2006, at the age of 77.

Overview The RC 4000 Multiprogramming System is historically notable for being the first attempt to break down an operating system into a group of interacting programs communicating via a message passing kernel. Although RC 4000 itself was not very successful it was nevertheless extremely influential, sparking the microkernel concept that dominated operating system research through the 1970s and 1980s. The system is also known as Monitor and, somewhat confusingly, simply RC 4000 depending on the reference. For clarity, this article will use the term Monitor. Monitor was created largely by one programmer, Per Brinch Hansen, who worked at Regnecentralen where the RC 4000 was being designed. Leif Svalgaard participated in the implementation and testing of Monitor. Brinch Hansen found that no existing operating system was suited to the new machine, and was tired of having to adapt existing systems. He felt that a better solution was to build an underlying kernel, which he referred to as the nucleus, that could be used to build up an operating system from interacting programs. Unix, for instance, uses small interacting programs for many tasks, transferring data through a system known as pipes. However a large amount of fundamental code is buried in the kernel itself, notably things like file systems and program control. Monitor would remove this code as well, making almost the entire system a set of interacting programs, reducing the kernel (nucleus) to a communications and support system only. Monitor used a pipe- like system of shared memory as the basis of its inter-process communications. Data to be sent from one process to another was copied into an empty memory buffer, and when the receiving program was ready, back out again. The buffer was then returned to the pool. Programs had a very simple API for passing data, using an asynchronous set of four methods. Client applications send data with \`send message\` and could optionally block using \`wait answer\`. Servers used a mirroring set of calls, \`wait message\` and \`send answer\`. Note that messages had an implicit \\"return path\\" for every message sent, making the semantics more like a remote procedure call than Mach's completely I/O-based system. Monitor divided the application space in two; internal processes were the execution of traditional programs, started on request, while external processes were effectively device drivers. External processes were actually handled outside of user space by the nucleus, although they could be started and stopped just like any other program. Internal processes were started in the context of the \\"parent\\" that launched them, so each user could effectively build up their own operating system by starting and stopping programs in their own context. Scheduling was left entirely to the programs, if required at all (in the 1960s, multitasking was a debatable feature). One user could start up a session in a pre-emptive multitasking environment, while another might start in a single-user mode to run batch processing at higher speed. Real-time scheduling could be supported by sending messages to a timer process that would only return at the appropriate time. These two areas have seen the vast majority of development since Monitor's release, driving newer designs to use hardware to support messaging, and supporting threads within applications to reduce launch times. For instance, Mach required a memory management unit to improve messaging by using the copy-on-write protocol and mapping (instead of copying) data from process to process. Mach also used threading extensively, allowing the external programs, or servers in more modern terms, to easily start up new handlers for incoming requests. Still, Mach IPC was too slow to make the microkernel approach practically useful. This only changed when Liedtke L4 microkernel demonstrated an order-of-magnitude improvement in IPC overheads.

It is located by lake Mälaren in south central Sweden, in the municipality of Strängnäs, about 60 km west of Stockholm. Since Gustav Vasa, Gripsholm has belonged to the Swedish Royal Family and was used as one of their residences until the 18th century. It is now a museum, but it is still considered to be a palace at the disposal of the King and as such it is part of the Crown palaces in Sweden.  History  Catherine Jagiellon and her son Sigismund in Gripsholm prison (National Museum in Warsaw). =Early history= A fortress was built at the location in the 1370s by Bo Jonsson Grip. It was sold to queen Margaret in 1404, and remained the property of the crown until it was acquired by Sten Sture the Elder, the Regent, in 1472 by an exchange of landed properties, whereby it became private, hereditary land of allodial status, to belong to the ownership of Regent Steen's own family. Steen donated the place's use to a convent for males of the order of the Carthusians in 1498, and the Gripsholm estate functioned as a convent for almost thirty years. In 1526, the Carthusian Abbey was dissolved by King Gustav I during the Swedish Reformation, and the estate was returned to its hereditary owner, the heir of the late Sten Sture the Old. It is well-recorded that Gripsholm was a part of the so-called Kungens Arv och Eget in registers of the 1500s and the 1600s. The King tore the convent building and the old castle down, and built a fortified castle with circular corner towers and a wall, for defensive purposes. Of the original medieval fortress, only the façade of a wall remains. As private family inheritance from the Regent Steen Sture the Old, the royal Vasa family held Gripsholm in high regard, as reminder of the royals' descent from earlier rulers, and used the place frequently. =Royal Residence= King Gustav had it constructed to serve as one of the main residences of the royal house. The castle was constructed between 1537 and 1545, and often served as the residence of the royal court: during the Dacke War, for example, the royal children were housed there. Between 1563 and 1567, King Eric XIV imprisoned his brother John and his consort Catherine Jagiellon in the castle. John's son Sigismund, later the King of Poland and Sweden, was born in the castle on June 20, 1566. When Eric XIV was deposed by John, Gripsholm Castle came to serve as one of the castles were John had Eric imprisoned. The deposed king Eric was kept prisoner here from 1571 until 1573. Gustav III's Theatre. The royal family continued to use Gripsholm Castle during the 17th-century. It was the dower residence of the widow of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, who lived here from 1636 until 1640.Moa Matthis: Maria Eleonora – Drottningen som sa nej, Bonniers 2010 Between 1654 and 1715, Gripsholm Castle was a part of the dower granted to queen Hedvig Eleonora, who often lived there with her court even before being widowed in 1660, and who rebuilt and expanded it in several ways.Nanna Lundh- Eriksson (1947). Hedvig Eleonora. Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand After her death, however, the Castle was abandoned by the court for some time. For a period during the 18th-century, it was used as a prison. In 1773, Gripsholm Castle was renovated by King Gustav III on behalf of his consort Sophia Magdalena. The castle was frequently used the royal court during the reign of Gustav III, who favored it and spent several months there every year. The perhaps most famous addition to the castle during his reign was a theater, which was added in one of the castle towers. It was the stage for both the amateur theatre of the royal court as well as The French Theater of Gustav III in 1781–1792. After the Coup of 1809, Gustav IV Adolf and his family were also imprisoned in the castle after his deposition from the throne. He had to sign his abdication document there. = Museum = Front view of the castle In 1822, the building came to host the National Portrait Gallery (Sweden), which was placed under the supervision of the Nationalmuseum in the 1860s. Between 1889 and 1894, the castle underwent a heavy and controversial restoration by the architect Fredrik Lilljekvist during which many of the 17th and 18th- century alterations were removed.Hall, Melanie. Towards World Heritage: International Origins of the Preservation Movement, 1870–1930 (Heritage, Culture and Identity) Ashgate Publishing Co. 2011. Page 205. The largest change was the addition of a third floor; the planned demolition of a wing did not take place. Now the castle is a museum which is open to the public, containing paintings and works of art. Part of the castle houses the National Portrait Gallery (Statens porträttsamlingar), one of the oldest portrait collections in the world. The museum includes a badly-stuffed lion which has become infamous in recent years.

He compiled the last of Sunni Islam's six canonical hadith collections, Sunan Ibn Mājah.Ludwig W. Adamec (2009), Historical Dictionary of Islam, p.139. Scarecrow Press. . Biography A map of present-day Iran showing the location of Qazwin, the place of birth and death of Ibn Mājah Ibn Mājah was born in Qazwin, the modern-day Iranian province of Qazvin, in 824 CE/209 AH to a family who were clients (mawla) of the Rabīʻah tribe. Mājah was the nickname of his father, and not that of his grandfather nor was it his mother's name, contrary to those claiming this. The hāʼ at the end is un- voweled whether in stopping upon its pronunciation or continuing because it a non-Arabic name. He left his hometown to travel the Islamic world visiting Iraq, Makkah, the Levant and Egypt. He studied under Ibn Abi Shaybah (through whom came over a quarter of al-Sunan), Muḥammad ibn ʻAbdillāh ibn Numayr, Jubārah ibn al-Mughallis, Ibrāhīm ibn al-Mundhir al-Ḥizāmī, ʻAbdullāh ibn Muʻāwiyah, Hishām ibn ʻAmmār, Muḥammad ibn Rumḥ, Dāwūd ibn Rashīd and others from their era. Abū Yaʻlā al-Khalīlī praised Ibn Mājah as \\"reliable (thiqah), prominent, agreed upon, a religious authority, possessing knowledge and the capability to memorize.\\" According to al-Dhahabī, Ibn Mājah died on approximately February 19, 887 CE/with eight days remaining of the month of Ramadan, 273 AH, or, according to al-Kattānī, in either 887/273 or 889/275. He died in Qazwin. What he compiled/did Al-Dhahabī mentioned the following of Ibn Mājah's works: * Sunan Ibn Mājah: one of the six canonical collections of hadith * Kitāb al-Tafsīr: a book of Qur'an exegesis * Kitāb al-Tārīkh: a book of history or, more likely, a listing of hadith transmitters =The Sunan= The Sunan consists of 1,500 chapters and about 4,000 hadith. Upon completing it, he read it to Abu Zur’a al-Razi, a hadith authority of his time, who commented, \\"I think that were people to get their hands on this, the other collections, or most of them, would be rendered obsolete.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Suhaib Hasan Abdul Ghaffar, Criticism of Hadith among Muslims with reference to Sunan Ibn Maja, Presidency of Islamic Research, IFTA and Propagation: Riyadh 1984. . * Brown, Jonathan A.

The lyrics are written primarily in German and English and are presented with male and female vocals. The themes of the songs usually centre around themes common in Gothic fiction such as love, vampirism, sexual fetishism, death, and immortality. The band calls their musical style dark pop.  History Formation and early years (1998–2001)= Blutengel was formed in 1998 after Chris Pohl had decided to give up the preceding project, Seelenkrank (which had released two albums), due to contractual problems. Just as its predecessor, Blutengel uses melodious electronic tunes in combination with both male and female voices. The lyrics are primarily in German or English and mixed between male and female vocals paired with electronic sounds and with songs often focusing on all aspects of love, from the tragedy of hopeless romance of vampires (all the way to the more animal aspects of desire) and aspects of death and the afterlife. The first album Child of Glass was released in early 1999 with Kati Roloff and Nina Bendigkeit as the original female vocalists. In 2001, the second album Seelenschmerz was released. Nina left to concentrate on photography and eventually form the band Formalin. Gini Martin joined the band as the second female voice alongside Kati. The first Blutengel gig ever took place at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen on June 1, 2001, in Leipzig, in front of 10,000 fans. At the end of 2001, the single Black Roses was released with Constance Rudert as a session singer. The band performed at the Dark Storm Festival where Constance appeared on stage with Kati and Gini. This was the last time the band would play with its original line-up. Kati and Gini left the band days later for personal reasons and founded their own project together, Tristesse de la Lune. Constance, who had originally only been recruited for the single \\"Black Roses\\", became a full time member of Blutengel. Eva Pölzing joined soon after as a second vocalist. =Rise in popularity (2002–2008)= Angel Dust was released in 2002, placing 58th on the German Charts. The Angel Dust promotional photo-shoot and booklet was made by Nina Bendigkeit. In 2004 their fourth album, Demon Kiss, was released, featuring the single \\"Forever\\". A DVD release Live Lines and the album-length EP The Oxidising Angel appeared in 2005, the latter of which contained new material as well as a cover of \\"Cry Little Sister\\" from The Lost Boys soundtrack. In early October Eva Pölzing decided to leave the band due to other projects. Eva was replaced by Ulrike Goldmann (ex-Say-Y). For the following two years, the band released a couple of singles with a slightly more \\"pop-driven\\" sound until their fifth album, Labyrinth was released in September 2007. It reached 36th in the German charts, and featured the single \\"Lucifer\\", and the live favourite \\"Engelsblut\\". =Extended albums (2009–2012)= In 2009 Blutengel released the album Schwarzes Eis, which featured the single \\"Dancing in the Light\\" and accompanying music video to promote the album. An extended edition of this album contained three full CDs, each with its own subtitle (Schwarzes Eis, the instrumental Behind the Mirror and Redemption). The EP Soultaker was released later that year. In 2010, they performed at the Amphi Festival featuring Anja Milow, Maria Rehfeld and Jenny Haufe who had been hired in 2009 as a dancers for the Schwarzes Eis Tour. Days later, it was announced on the official website that Constance had been replaced by two new singers, Anja Milow and Steffi Weingarten. Both featured on the seventh album Tränenherz, released in 2011 and placed in the German charts at number 12. Two singles \\"Über den Horizont\\" & \\"Reich Mir Die Hand\\" were released to promote the album, with accompanying music videos the latter featuring Pohl's new girlfriend Viki Scarlet as the \\"Bloody Girl\\" in Reich Mir Die Hand who would later become a permanent dancer. The EP Nachtbringer followed that same year. a music video was released for the title track featuring the complete lineup excluding Jenny for this video. Steffi was fired from the band before they began touring and on her official Facebook page, she wrote a statement claiming that she was not allowed to tour due to legal issues with Constance. Jenny left in 2012, followed by Anja to focus on her job as a model for the clothing label AMF Korsets, continue college studies and work as an independent designer with her label Madone Noire. =Monument and Black Symphonies (2012–2014)= From May 12 to May 20, 2012 Blutengel toured North America for the first time. Playing in Mexico City, New York, San Antonio, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and in Montreal for the Kinetik Festival. After the tour Maria Rehfeld left the band. The first single from the album Monument, \\"Save Our Souls\\", was released in November 2012 while the second single, \\"You Walk Away\\", was released in January 2013. The album Monument was released in February 2013 and placed #4 & #96 on the German and Switzerland music charts respectively. \\"Kinder dieser Stadt was released on July 19, 2013, as the third single from Monument. Blutengel released an orchestral compilation album, Black Symphonies (An Orchestral Journey), on February 28, 2014. A single and music video for \\"Krieger\\" were released to promote the album. =Omen & Nemesis: The Best of & Reworked (2014–2016)= The first single \\"Asche Zu Asche\\", from their upcoming album was released on November 14, 2014. The second single, \\"Sing\\", was released on January 23, 2015. Omen was released on February 12, 2015. The band then embarked on the first leg of the Omen tour in April and spanning through to August. Festival appearances include Wave-Gotik-Treffen, Mera Luna Festival, and Summer Breeze Open Air. A new EP, In Alle Ewigkeit, was announced via the band's website in early August as well as the tour dates for the second leg of the Omen tour, which began in November and ended in early December. The new EP was released 23 October 2015, and featured a reworking of 'Weg Zu Mir' originally from 'Child of Glass' which served as a preview for the upcoming 'Best of' album. Chris Pohl recorded guest vocals on Italian industrial group Helalyn Flowers' \\"Beware of Light\\" single which was released by Belgian label Alfa Matrix Records in October of 2015. On 26 February 2016, their 'best of' album Nemesis: The Best of & Reworked was released with re- recorded versions of BlutEngel classics. To support this release, they will be playing 'Nemesis - Open Air Festival' in July. Due to legal issues, Omen was re-released under the title Save Us. =Leitbild & Un:Gott (2016–present)= In early 2016, BlutEngel entered the studio to record a new album, set for a release in February 2017. \\"Complete\\", the first single from the upcoming 10th album, Leitbild, was released on December 2, 2016. it featured two B-sides and a remix by British darkwave act Massive Ego.

The Sunan was authored by Ibn Mājah (b. 209/824, d. 273/887). Description It contains over 4,000 aḥādīth in 32 books (kutub) divided into 1,500 chapters (abwāb). About 20 of the traditions it contains were later declared to be forged; such as those dealing with the merits of individuals, tribes or towns, including Ibn Mājah's home town of Qazwin.  Views Sunnis regard this collection as sixth in terms of authenticity of their Six major Hadith collections. Although Ibn Mājah related hadith from scholars across the eastern Islamic world, neither he nor his Sunan were well known outside of his native region of northwestern Iran until the 5th/11th century. Muḥammad ibn Ṭāhir al-Maqdisī (d. 507/1113) remarked that while Ibn Mājah's Sunan was well regarded in Rayy, it was not widely known among the broader community of Muslim jurists outside of Iran. It was also Muḥammad b. Ṭāhir who first proposed a six-book canon of the most authentic Sunni hadith collections in his Shurūṭ al-aʾimma al-sitta, which included Ibn Mājah's Sunan alongside Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawud, Sunan Nasai, and Jami al- Tirmidhi. Nonetheless, consensus among Sunni scholars concerning this six-book canon, which included Ibn Mājah's Sunan, did not occur until the 7th/13th century, and even then this consensus was largely contained to the Sunni scholarly community in the eastern Islamic world. Scholars such as al-Nawawi (d. 676/1277) and Ibn Khaldun (d. 808/1405) excluded Sunan Ibn Mājah from their lists of canonical Sunni hadith collections, while others replaced it with either the Muwaṭṭaʾ of Imām Mālik or with the Sunan ad-Dārimī. It was not until Ibn al-Qaisarani's formal standardization of the Sunni hadith cannon into six books in the 11th century that Ibn Majah's collection was regarded the esteem granted to the five other books.

He seems to fit into a 7-year period in the Turin Canon for which there is no recorded king. Rock inscriptions He is known from a few inscriptions in Wadi Hammamat that record expeditions to the Red Sea coast and to quarry stone for the royal monuments. It seems that he was a son of his predecessor. Also, he is attested by the inscriptions at Wadi el-Hudi. Another relevant inscription is found in Ain Sukhna. page=4a and 4b }} These locations were the usual staging harbours for the expeditions to the Sinai. Despite Mentuhotep's obscurity (he is absent from the official Abydos king list), the inscriptions show the organization and makeup of a large expedition during his reign. The leader of an expedition to Wadi Hammamat, during the second year of Mentuhotep IV’s reign, was his vizier, Amenemhat, who is assumed to be the future king Amenemhat I, the first king of the 12th Dynasty, and Mentuhotep's immediate successor. A fragment of a slate bowl found at Lisht North was regarded for a long time to be inscribed on the outside with the official titulary of Mentuhotep IV, and on the inside with that of King Amenemhat I, his successor. Since the two inscriptions are incised in a different style of writing, according to Dorothea Arnold, this indicates that Amenemhat had his name added to an older vessel that already bore the name of Mentuhotep IV.Dorothea Arnold, Amenemhat I and the Early Twelfth Dynasty at Thebes. Metropolitan Museum Journal, v. 26 (1991) However, Peter Janosi showed that Mentuhotep IV is not mentioned on the bowl, the titulary preserved there fits better to Mentuhotep II. End of reign It is assumed by some Egyptologists that Amenemhat either usurped the throne or assumed power after Mentuhotep IV died childless. There is currently no archaeological or textual evidence to prove that Mentuhotep was deposed by his vizier or that he chose Amenemhat to be his designated successor. Neither his mummy nor his burial place have been found.

The name stems from the cost of restaurants literally printing new menus, but economists use it to refer to the costs of changing nominal prices in general. In this broader definition, menu costs might include updating computer systems, re-tagging items, and hiring consultants to develop new pricing strategies as well as the literal costs of printing menus. More generally, the menu cost can be thought of as resulting from costs of information, decision and implementation resulting in bounded rationality. Because of this expense, firms sometimes do not always change their prices with every change in supply and demand, leading to nominal rigidity. Generally, the effect on the firm of small shifts in price (by changes in supply and/or demand, or else because of slight adjustments in monetary policy) is relatively minor compared to the costs of notifying the public of this new information. Therefore, the firm would rather exist in slight disequilibrium than incur the menu costs. History The concept of a lump- sum cost (menu cost) to changing the price was originally introduced by Sheshinski and Weiss (1977) in their paper looking at the effect of inflation on the frequency of price-changes. The idea of applying it as a general theory of Nominal Price Rigidity was simultaneously put forward by several New Keynesian economists in 1985–6. George Akerlof and Janet Yellen put forward the idea that due to bounded rationality firms will not want to change their price unless the benefit is more than a small amount. This bounded rationality leads to inertia in nominal prices and wages which can lead to output fluctuating at constant nominal prices and wages. Gregory Mankiw took the menu-cost idea and focused on the welfare effects of changes in output resulting from sticky prices. Michael Parkin also put forward the idea. The menu cost idea was also extended to wages as well as prices by Olivier Blanchard and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki. The new Keynesian explanation of price stickiness relied on introducing imperfect competition with price (and wage) setting agents. This started a shift in macroeconomics away from using the model of perfect competition with price taking agents to using imperfectly competitive equilibria with price and wage setting agents (mostly adopting monopolistic competition). Huw Dixon and Claus Hansen showed that even if menu costs applied to a small sector of the economy, this would influence the rest of the economy and lead to prices in the rest of the economy becoming less responsive to changes in demand. In 2007, Mikhail Golosov and Robert Lucas found that the size of the menu cost needed to match the micro-data of price adjustment inside an otherwise standard business cycle model is implausibly large to justify the menu-cost argument. The reason is that such models lack \\"real rigidity\\".Ball L. and Romer D (1990). Real Rigidities and the Non- neutrality of Money, Review of Economic Studies, volume 57, pages: 183-203 This is a property that markups do not get squeezed by large adjustment in factor prices (such as wages) that could occur in response to the monetary shock. Modern New Keynesian models address this issue by assuming that the labor market is segmented, so that the expansion in employment by a given firm does not lead to lower profits for the other firms.Michael Woodford (2003), Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy. Princeton University Press, . Deeper analysis 300px Consider a hypothetical firm in a hypothetical economy, with a concave graph describing the relationship between the price of its good and the firm's corresponding profit. As always, the profit maximizing point lies at the very top for the curve. Now suppose that there exists a drop in aggregate output. While this causes real wages to fall (shifting the profit curve upward, allowing more profit for the same price), it also diminishes demand for the firm's product (shifting the curve down). Suppose the net effect is a downward shift (as it usually is). The result is a maximum profit associated with a lower price (the max profit shifts to the left a bit, as a result of the profit curve moving). Suppose the old price (and thus the old maximizing profit price) was M and the new maximizing price is N. Also suppose the new maximum profit is B and new profit corresponding to the old price is A. Thus price M yields A in profit and price N yields B in profit. Now suppose there is a menu cost, Z, in changing from price M to price N. Because the firm must pay Z to make this change, they will only pay it if Z < B-A. Thus tiny fluctuations in the economy leads to small differences in B and A so firms do not change their price, even if Z is small. Note that if Z is zero, then prices will change all the time, allowing for firms to squeeze out every bit of profit from every change in the economy.

Biography A native of Podgora, Letica graduated from the University of Zagreb Faculty of Economics in 1971. In the 1980s, Letica was a professor of sociology of medicine at the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb and a consultant for the World Health Organization, working on health service management projects in a number of countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. In late 1980s, as the Communist grip on public discourse weakened, Letica began to use new freedoms to advocate various reforms. In doing so, he wrote many articles and columns and he began to appear in television talk shows and town hall meetings, quickly becoming one of the most popular and the most recognisable intellectuals in Yugoslavia. In May 1990, after the first democratic elections, Franjo Tuđman made him his personal advisor. During negotiations which Tuđman pursued with the leader of the Serbs in Croatia, Jovan Rašković, Letica leaked the transcript of the secretly recorded conversation between Tuđman and Rašković to the Croatian media, hoping that some of Rašković's controversial remarks would give offense to his fellow Croatian Serbs and turn them away from his secessionist policies. As a consequence, however, the comparably moderate Rašković was replaced by Serb radicals, which hastened the start of the war in Croatia. Letica and Tuđman parted ways in March 1991 due to disagreement about Croatian politics towards Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the following years Letica continued to appear in the Croatian media as a commentator, espousing opposition views, and became a regular columnist for Globus, a popular news magazine. During his time at Globus he gained some notoriety due to an unsigned 1992 opinion piece (which he eventually admitted to have written), titled \\"Croatian Feminists are Raping Croatia\\", in which he attacked five Croatian feminist writers (Slavenka Drakulić, Vesna Kesić, Jelena Lovrić, Dubravka Ugrešić and Rada Iveković), accusing them of betraying Croatia. The article was a source of significant controversy which ultimately resulted in a successful defamation lawsuit against the magazine. =Political career= In the 2000 Croatian presidential election, Letica ran as an independent candidate. Although he finished fourth, the relatively high percentage of votes he won (4.14%) made him desirable to the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), a right-wing party in desperate need to tone down its negative far-right image. Letica, with his reputation of a refined urbanite and European intellectual, served this purpose very well and on the 2003 Croatian parliamentary election, as a candidate on HSP's list, won a seat in the Sabor (Croatian Parliament). He also associated at one point with the Croatian True Revival, a one-time political project of Miroslav Tuđman and Nenad Ivanković that failed to gain major traction in Croatian politics. The HSP nevertheless used Letica again as their candidate in the 2005 Croatian presidential election. When Letica won fewer votes than in 2000, 2.59%, he accused the HSP of not supporting him enough. He quit the party midway through his term and remained in the Sabor until January 2008 as an independent. In the 2007 Croatian parliamentary election, his independent list for the Zagreb region failed to gain the five percent of the vote needed to enter the Parliament. =Personal life= Letica is married to Gordana Cerjan- Letica, a sociologist and a professor at the School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb. They have two sons, Bartol (born 1976) and Frane (born 1982).

The reservoir is fed by the Angelina River, the major tributary of the Neches River. The Reservoir is upstream of the Big Thicket National Preserve. The reservoir's capacity is , and is the largest lake wholly within the state of Texas. The reservoir is operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth district.  History  Sam Rayburn Reservoir Construction began September 7, 1956, and the reservoir began serving its purpose on March 29, 1965. The main purposes of the reservoir are flood control, hydroelectric power generation, and conservation of water. Construction costs, including those for recreation facilities, were estimated at about $66 million. It was known as McGee Bend Dam and Reservoir until 1963. In September of that year, the 88th Congress adopted a special resolution changing the name to \\"Sam Rayburn Dam and Reservoir\\" in honor of the recently deceased Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn, a long-time champion of soil and water conservation. Dedication ceremonies were held on May 8, 1965. In accordance with the 1945 federal Rivers and Harbors Act, four reservoirs were originally approved for the Neches and Angelina Rivers Basin. They were designated as Dam A, Dam B, Rockland, and McGee Bend. The first to be built was Dam B, completed on the Neches River in 1953. The name was changed to Town Bluff Dam and B. A. Steinhagen Reservoir, but locals still refer to it as Dam B. In 1955, Congress approved the funding for McGee Bend Dam and Reservoir, and construction began in 1957. Congress changed the name to Sam Rayburn Dam and Reservoir in 1963, and it was formally dedicated in 1965. The Dam A and Rockland dams, which were to be on the Neches River upstream from the convergence of the Neches and Angelina Rivers, were deemed to be unnecessary and listed as \\"deferred\\". Lake Sam Rayburn can be crossed on Texas State Highway 147 and is a popular recreation destination, both for boating and fishing, with game fish species in the lake including largemouth bass, bluegill, and channel catfish. Due to the abundance of bass, it is home to more than 300 tournaments annually, which include tournaments such as ESPN/BASS Masters, BASS Champs, Wal Mart BFL, FLW Outdoors, the Cabela's Texas Team Trail, Angler's Quest, Bass-n-Bucks, and McDonald's Big Bass Splash.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Lake Information In 2018, Lake Sam Rayburn was ranked number one by Bassmaster magazine for being the best bass lake in the nation.2018 Bassmaster Best Lakes Famous people The science-fiction and fantasy writer Ardath Mayhar lived near Sam Rayburn Lake, on a homestead bordering the Attoyac River above the lake.

It began operation on October 1, 1971 as one of Walt Disney World Resort's first two on-site hotels. The resort has a South Seas theme, and originally opened with 492 rooms. It was designed by Welton Becket and Associates and constructed by US Steel Realty Development. The resort is owned and operated by Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Since its opening in 1971, the resort has seen three major expansions; the first in 1978, with the addition of a longhouse, the Tangaroa Terrace restaurant/support facility, and a secondary pool. A second expansion took place in 1985, with the construction of two additional longhouses. In that same year, the resort adopted the shortened name \\"Disney's Polynesian Resort\\". On May 2, 2014, it was announced that the resort would revert to the Disney's Polynesian Village Resort title while expanding further to include Disney Vacation Club accommodations as well as enhanced resort amenities. On April 1, 2015, the third expansion officially opened, including the new DVC additions and other amenities around the resort. Design A white sand beach off of Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, with the Tuvalu Longhouse in viewDisney's Polynesian Village Resort is situated on the southern shore of the manmade Seven Seas Lagoon, south of Magic Kingdom and adjacent to other Walt Disney World complexes, with the Transportation and Ticket Center to the east and Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa to the west. The resort is on the Magic Kingdom monorail loop, providing transportation to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot (via transfer), and is part of the route for Disney's Magic Kingdom Resorts Water Launch service. Other Walt Disney World Resort theme parks and attractions are served by Disney Transport buses. The Great Ceremonial House featured a large \\"tropical rainforest\\" in its atrium with waterfalls until 2014.The resort is organized around a central building named the Great Ceremonial House, itself designed after a Tahitian royal assembly lodge. The Great Ceremonial House houses guest services and most of the resort's dining and merchandise locations. From its opening until 2014, the Great Ceremonial House also featured an expansive tropical waterfall feature in its atrium, with over 75 species of plant life. The waterfall and foliage were removed and replaced, however, during extensive resort renovations due to health and safety concerns and to reimagine the lobby as a social space. No rooms are contained in this building, instead several lodges - longhouses - and water bungalows house all guest rooms and are spread out amongst resort property. As of 2008, Disney's Polynesian Village Resort is certified green lodging property with the state of Florida. =Original design and construction= The resort used United States Steel's then newly developed construction process for its original longhouses; steel frames were erected on-site, and pre- constructed modular rooms were lifted into these frames via crane, similar to Disney's Contemporary Resort. This method of building caused problems in both Disney's Polynesian and Contemporary Resorts, with guest complaints of a moldy smell in their rooms. It was found that mold and debris had collected in the spaces between each room. The spaces were filled in, stopping the problem, and Longhouses built as part of the resort's later expansions were built using conventional building techniques. With newly found construction photos of the Polynesian Resort found, the rooms were done differently than the Contemporary. The Polynesian Resort, the Contemporary Resort, and the Court of Flags Resort all had the rooms built off site. The difference was instead of sliding the rooms into a metal frame like the Contemporary, they stacked the rooms and built the frame/concrete around them. Actual construction photos showing the stacking system =Accommodations= The resort design and layout consists of 11 two and three story longhouses, spread throughout the property. The resort originally opened with 484 guest rooms in 8 longhouses, Bali Hai, Bora Bora, Fiji, Hawaii, Maui, Samoa, Tahiti and Tonga.http://www.tikimanpages.com/poly/history/1970s In 1978, the Oahu longhouse was added. The Moorea and Pago Pago longhouses were added in 1985. Between 2013 and 2015, 20 over-the-water DVC bungalows were constructed in a new area named Bora Bora. On October 28, 1999, most of the resort's longhouses were renamed. Today the longhouses are named for islands on the Polynesian isle map, with chosen longhouse names matching the relative geographic position of their namesake island(s). Ten of the eleven longhouses, excluding Fiji, were renamed: Bali Hai became Tonga; Bora Bora became Niue; Hawaii became Samoa; Maui became Rarotonga; Moorea became Tahiti; Oahu became Tokelau; Pago Pago became Rapa Nui; Samoa became Tuvalu; Tahiti became Aotearoa and Tonga became Hawaii. The 2013-15 resort reimagining has returned the original names of the DVC longhouses. Two of the current longhouses, Hawaii (formerly Tonga) and Tonga (formerly Bali Hai), offer a Concierge Lounge - where refreshments, views, and lounge space are offered exclusively to guests of Hawaii or Tonga. Shopping The resort offers several shopping areas focused on Disney parks merchandise, resort-specific specialty merchandise, and convenience items, located in the Great Ceremonial House. BouTiki is located off the main lobby, with Moana Mercantile located opposite Kona Cafe on the second floor. Trader Sam's Grog Grotto also offers a limited range of merchandise. The Lava Pool is the resort's main themed pool, featuring zero-entry, a water slide and water play area. Disney's Polynesian Villas & Bungalows On September 17, 2013 Disney Vacation Club announced that its next planned location would be at Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort. The first phase of DVC expansion to the resort opened April 1, 2015, adding 20 over-the-water 'Bora Bora' Bungalows and converting 2 existing buildings (Moorea (formerly Tahiti), Pago Pago (formerly Rapa Nui)) into Deluxe Studios. The Tokelau conversion was completed mid-2015 creating a total of 360 Deluxe Studios between the 3 buildings. Between the three DVC longhouses is a barbecue area for the use of resort guests, with two gas barbecues. In addition there will be 5 new rooms added between the Moorea, Tokelau and Pago Pago vacation club buildings.

History  The regiment was formed with 800 men in 1861 and was placed in a brigade along with the 24th New York, 30th New York, 84th New York (14th Brooklyn) (also known as the 14th New York State Militia), and for a number of months, the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters (a regiment under the respected Colonel Henry A. V. Post). The brigade was the First Brigade in the First Corps of the Army of the Potomac, and Colonel Walter Phelps and the regiments of the brigade referred to themselves as the Iron Brigade of the East and served with the Division's more famous Fourth Brigade which would earn the title \\"Iron Brigade of the West\\" in September 1862 during Battle of South Mountain in the Maryland Campaign. Colonel Walter Phelps was chosen as the original commander of the regiment, and after his promotion to brigade commander, Major John McKie became regimental commander. The regiment suffered its first fatality when passing through Baltimore, when a man was killed by friendly fire during confusion among a mob. It would go on to serve in the Army of the Potomac's I Corps and III Corps, and fight at the battles of Second Bull Run, South Mountain, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. The regiment was mustered out of service on June 19, 1863, and those men who had signed three year enlistments were transferred to the 76th New York and 93rd New York.*New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center - Civil War - 22nd Infantry Regiment History, photographs, table of battles and casualties, and historical sketch for the 22nd New York Infantry Regiment.

They reside alongside the epithelium lining the lumen of the digestive tract and play a crucial role in gastrointestinal regulation, particularly intestinal motility and secretion. They were discovered by Nikolai Kulchitsky. EC cells modulate neuron signalling in the enteric nervous system (ENS) via the secretion of the neurotransmitter serotonin and other peptides. As enteric afferent and efferent nerves do not protrude into the intestinal lumen, EC cells act as a form of sensory transduction. Serotonin in the ENS acts in synergy with other digestive hormones to regulate sensory and motor gastrointestinal reflexes. EC cells respond to both chemical and neurological stimuli. They are also reactive to mechanosensation, which is the case in the peristaltic reflex of the gut, and can be stimulated by a bolus moving through the bowel. Upon activation, EC cells release serotonin to act upon serotonin receptors on ENS neurons. Dependent on concentration, serotonin can then modulate peristaltic contraction and secretion through activation of smooth muscle and glands, respectively. Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells in the respiratory tract are known as bronchial Kulchitsky cells. Structure EC cells are small polygonal cells located in the crypts between intestinal villi. They are discriminated from other cells of the gastrointestinal epithelial crypts by the presence of basally located granulations that contain serotonin and other peptides. Ultrastructurally, these granules are reported to vary in size and shape and are considered pleomorphic. Most EC cells communicate with the lumen of intestinal crypts through apical microvilli (protrusions) and are referred to as “open”. A proportion of EC cells do not protrude into the crypt lumen and are subsequently referred to as ‘closed’. EC cells typically extend down to the basal lamina with cytoplasmic extensions known to pass through the connective tissue and neighbouring glands. Tissue beneath EC cells typically contains abundant fenestrated capillaries, lymph vessels and small unmyelinated nerve fibres. Secreted serotonin can either be taken up into residing vessels (transported in the blood by platelets) or act on nerve synaptic terminals. =Distribution= EC cells are found aggregated in specific locations throughout the gastrointestinal tract, predominantly in the small intestine, colon and appendix. The proportion of high-density cell populations varies between species attributed to differences in dietary requirements and physiological characteristics. =\\"Enterochromaffin-like Cells\\"= “Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells” are a population of cells that are found in the gastric pits of the stomach luminal epithelium and secrete histamine. In response to gastrin released by neighbouring G-cells, secreted histamine from ECL cells acts on parietal cells to stimulate the release of gastric acid. The presence of ECL cells is critical in regulation of endocrine-induced gastric acid secretion. ECL cells histologically appear similar to EC cells and are hence named as such. They are however a different cell type and do not possess any serotonin synthesizing mechanisms. Development In developing chick embryos, EC cells have been found in biopsies of developing GIT tissue before the migration of neural crest cells. Whilst EC cells have neuroendocrine properties and are similar chemically and histologically to cells of the adrenal medulla they are not derivatives of the neural crest and do not share a similar cell progenitor. EC cells are believed to be derived from endodermal origins and are descended from the stem cells that form other epithelial cell types of the gastrointestinal lumen. Function The primary function of EC cells is to synthesise and secrete serotonin for modulation of gastrointestinal neurons. Serotonin, also named 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), can be classified as a hormone, neurotransmitter and a mitogen. It is primarily known for its role in the central nervous system but plays an important role in the periphery, with the largest endogenous pool of serotonin residing in the gut (90% of endogenous store). In the ENS, serotonin is an essential modulator of sensory transduction and mucus secretion. Release of serotonin from EC cells can be triggered by a multitude of stimuli, particularly luminal distension, parasympathetic innervation or changes in osmotic concentrations in intestinal contents. =Serotonin synthesis= The synthesis of 5-HT, in EC cells, is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TpH1) from the amino acid L-tryptophan. The reaction proceeds in two stages with an initial rate limiting step involving the conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). Following conversion to 5-HTP, the non-rate limiting L-amino acid decarboxylase converts 5-HTP to 5-HT by decarboxylation. Following synthesis, 5-HT is then stored in vesicles by vesicular monoamine transporter 1 close to the basal margin of the cell for eventual secretion. Release of the vesicles occurs after chemical, neurological or mechanical stimulation of the EC cells and is predominantly calcium dependent, suggesting excretion via exocytosis. The combined effect of increased calcium flux and a liberation of stored calcium within the cell changes the cell potential triggering release of the 5-HT vesicles. The vesicles pass from the basal margin into the surrounding lamina propria for interaction with nearby nerve synapses, lymph and blood vessels. The serotonin synthesised by EC cells is predominately exocytosed from the basal border, but is also known to be apically secreted into the lumen of the gut and can be present in faecal samples. Secreted 5-HT acts on different receptor subtypes found localised in cells in the gastrointestinal epithelium, smooth muscle and connective tissue with responsiveness dependent on the concentration of the secreted hormone. The primary effect of serotonin involves the increase in peristaltic contraction through its effects on both ENS neurons and smooth muscle. 5-HT also activates a neural secretory response, whereby binding at 5-HT1P receptors on myenteric neurons triggers a signalling cascade in the submucosal plexus. This results in the release of acetylcholine to initiate secretion from the gut mucosa via release of chloride ions. Clinical significanceIrritable bowel syndrome= Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a diverse condition associated with chronic bowel discomfort and abdominal pain that ranges in severity between patients. Abnormal concentrations of serotonin have been associated with IBS, predominantly increased concentrations intensifying gastrointestinal motility and mucosal secretions from the gut mucosa. Severe IBS often manifests as either chronic constipation or chronic diarrhoea, and abnormal EC cell populations have been correlated with both conditions. In patients suffering post-infectious IBS, rectal biopsies have shown a dramatic increase in populations of EC cells associated with diarrhoeal symptoms. Likewise, reduced populations of EC cells in patients suffering chronic constipation have been observed, indicating a lack of 5-HT, and therefore decreased GI motility and secretion. Ongoing research indicates that abnormal EC cell populations, and therefore 5-HT signalling, may significantly contribute to gastrointestinal dysfunction. Treatment using 5-HT-receptor agonists for patients with functional constipation have shown some effectiveness in achieving normal GI functionality. =Carcinoid syndrome= Carcinoid syndrome is a rare condition characterized by an abnormal increase in circulating biologically active hormones, largely serotonin, with early symptoms involving diarrhea, abdominal cramping and episodic flushing. Excess circulating serotonin is usually manufactured by EC- cell-originated carcinoid tumors in the small bowel or appendix. Tumors are slow growing, but can metastasise to the liver if aggressive. They can also be present at other sites, particularly the lung and stomach. History The name ‘enterochromaffin’ comes from the Greek word “enteron” (ἔντερον), in relation to intestines, and “chromaffin” as a grouping of the words chromium and affinity, as they can be visualised by staining with chromium salts. Similarly named, Chromaffin cells (of the adrenal medulla) share this characteristic and are histologically similar to EC cells. Their embryological origins, however, are quite different, nor do they possess similar functions.

It uses camshafts and poppet valves rather than the piston valves used in other valve gear. While basing his design on automotive valves, Caprotti made several significant departures from this design to adapt the valves for steam. Having agreed a joint-venture with Worcester-based engineering company Heenan & Froude from 1938, Heenan & Froude fully acquired Caprotti post-World War II in 1947. Usage in Italy The Caprotti valve gear was first tested on a Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Class 740 2-8-0 mixed-traffic locomotive in 1921; although more expensive and complicated than the standard piston valves, it substantially improved the locomotive's performance. Until the 1930s it was fitted on some 334 FS locomotives and on 77 narrow-gauge locomotives of other companies; of the former, some were new-builds, the others were rebuilds of non-superheated compound locomotives. Given their need for more complex and expensive maintenance, most of these locomotives were generally withdrawn from service before those with Walschaerts valve gear, in the 1960s. Usage in Great Britain In August 1926, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway equipped four-cylinder 4-6-0 locomotive no. 5908 of the Claughton Class with Caprotti valve gear and poppet valves. Following trials, nine more were rebuilt in 1928 with Caprotti valve gear, poppet valves and larger boilers, and also in 1928 ten others of the same class were given the larger boiler but retained the Walschaerts valve gear and piston valves with which this class was originally fitted, to enable comparisons to be made between the two types of valve gear. Later that year, no. 5908 was also given a larger boiler. It was found that the Caprotti-fitted locomotives were more economical on coal and water than those with Walschaerts valve gear, but it was later found that some of the losses of the Walschaerts locomotives was due to leakage of steam past the valve heads, where a single wide ring was used. New piston valves having several narrow rings were fitted to one locomotive, and it was then found that the Walschaerts valve gear could be just as economical as the Caprotti, but with considerably less cost of fitment. No more Claughtons were fitted with Caprotti valve gear, and the ten locomotives were withdrawn in 1935–36. On the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), two 4-6-0 locomotives of LNER Class B3 were rebuilt with Caprotti valve gear in 1929, followed by a further two in 1938–39. These locomotives also had four cylinders, and the poppet valves were mounted vertically, two at each end of each cylinder. One of the first pair of locomotives was rebuilt with Walschaerts valve gear in 1943, but the other three ran with Caprotti valve gear until withdrawal in 1946–47. British Caprotti In the 1950s, Caprotti valve gear was improved and this British Caprotti valve gear was fitted to the last two British Railways-built 'Black Fives' 44686/7, the last 30 BR standard class 5s, numbers 73125-54, and the unique BR standard class 8 71000 Duke of Gloucester. Results were mixed, with the performance of the Duke of Gloucester being particularly disappointing. That was later found to be due to errors elsewhere in the design and construction of the locomotive. Although more expensive to manufacture than its rivals, the improved Caprotti valve gear is considerably more efficient than any other. A major improvement is that much of the mechanism is enclosed, leading to reduced wear and tear from the harsh steam locomotive environment, and completely independent control of admission and exhaust. The restored Duke of Gloucester, with its flaws eliminated, has proved the concept.

B. Morton (7 June 1893 – 10 May 1979) was an English humorous writer noted for authoring a column called \\"By the Way\\" under the pen name 'Beachcomber' in the Daily Express from 1924 to 1975. G. K. Chesterton described Morton as \\"a huge thunderous wind of elemental and essential laughter\\"; according to Evelyn Waugh, he had \\"the greatest comic fertility of any Englishman\\".  Childhood  Morton was born at Park Lodge, Mitcham Road, Tooting. He was an only child, and his father, Edward Morton, was a serious journalist and dramatic critic. He introduced Morton junior to (watered-down) wine before he went to school, and to the sons of his friend Leslie Stuart. His mother, Rosamond Bingham, died when he was 12. From the age of eight Morton attended Park House prep school in Southborough, London. In 1907 he moved on to Harrow School and hated it. Harrow later provided the inspiration for the fictional Narkover, a school full of theft, gambling, drinking, and corruption. Morton was admitted to Worcester College, Oxford but failed to win a scholarship, and had to leave after a year to support his father after a stroke. Morton did not have an outstanding academic career, and left Oxford wanting to be a poet. His talent as a poet proved to be limited.  Career  Early career = Quickly realising that he could not make a living from poetry, Morton found a job writing for a musical revue, until he was interrupted by the outbreak of war in 1914. He enlisted as a private in the Royal Fusiliers and was sent to the trenches the following year. The battalion was disbanded in 1916 and Morton was commissioned in the Suffolk Regiment. After fighting in the Somme he was sent home with shell shock and spent the rest of the war in the intelligence service. After the war, Morton wrote a novel, The Barber of Putney, based on his experience of life in the trenches. It was published in 1919, and the same year, he started writing for the Sunday Express newspaper. He had a weekly column which he filled with random jokes and poems, and wrote occasional essays on cross-country walking—his favourite hobby. In 1922, he was moved over to the Daily Express as a reporter, but did not enjoy straight reporting. Morton later recalled, \\"I remember being asked to interview the mother of a boy who'd killed someone. As I went along in the cab, I thought: 'D'you realise what you're doing?' Then I decided I couldn't go on.\\" = Beachcomber = On 7 July 1917, the \\"By the Way\\" column first appeared on the leader page of the Express. Nothing shocking at first, it was 900 words of gossip and topical comment previously appearing under the header \\"Gossip of the Day\\". Major John Bernard Arbuthnot MVO started the new column and the 'Beachcomber' pseudonym that appeared a week later. In 1919, he was promoted to Assistant Editor, and D. B. Wyndham Lewis (the literary editor) took the column over. Like Morton, Wyndham-Lewis had also served in the ranks in the War, and the two shared a bizarre sense of humour, as well as being fellow Francophiles. Wyndham-Lewis set the surreal, comic style that was to become the column's identifying feature, and published the first collection of Beachcomber material in 1922, entitled A London Farrago. With so much in common, when Morton moved into his cubicle they quickly became friends, and their continual banter could be heard across the top floor of the building. Thus, when Wyndham Lewis moved to the Daily Mail in April 1924, Morton was the obvious person to continue the column. He gradually lightened the tone of the humour, and introduced a range of recurring characters. Morton published his first Beachcomber collection, Mr Thake, in 1929, and 17 more collections followed over the next 30 years. Early on, Morton wrote his column in the offices of the Express, and was known for laughing out loud and dancing after finishing each paragraph. As a day's column never took more than a few hours, and he always wrote a week in advance, his afternoons were always free for socialising. In later years, he despatched the (hand-written) column by post from wherever he happened to be at the time. Morton viewed the Beachcomber sobriquet as a protective blanket of anonymity, and continued to enjoy this until his identity was revealed in the thirties. Drawings in the column depicted Beachcomber as a young woman, and the column was widely believed to be composed of many people's contributions. Behind this cover, Morton often indulged himself in opinionated rants about new inventions, motorists, Socialists, pretentious art, public schools, and whatever else aroused his wrath. Under Morton's pen, By the Way continued for many years, surviving the Second World War paper shortages and consequent shrinkage of the Express to four pages. His mockery of both Nazi propaganda and British red tape was recognised as a huge contribution to morale, and Morton became a CBE in 1952. In 1965, the column was enlarged and made weekly. The final column appeared on 29 November 1975 containing the headline \\"Lawnmower Used on Vet's Whiskers\\". A BBC radio programme Beachcomber by the Way, based on the column, was broadcast for 18 episodes from 1989 to 1994, with Richard Ingrams playing the voice of Beachcomber. John Wells, John Sessions and Patricia Routledge played supporting parts, in particular Wells as the impertinent questioner Prodnose forever asking Beachcomber what he meant by what he said. = Other work = Morton also wrote a few pieces on French history, in the style of his good friend Hilaire Belloc, but these were not widely read and are now forgotten. After his retirement, he started work on an autobiography, but said it would be a \\"boring\\" read and tore up his notes. Another work is SPRINGTIME: Tales of the Café Rieu, describing life on the Parisian Left Bank.  Friends and adventures  Morton fell in with J. C. Squire's circle of acquaintances. Squire was the editor of the London Mercury, and his reputation for helping young writers had caused him to accrue a posse of writers and poets, which Morton was happy to join on excursions to pubs in the area of Fleet Street. Squire's amateur cricket team is described in England, Their England by A. G. Macdonell; the exuberant character Tommy Huggins is based on Morton. This also introduced him to Hilaire Belloc, whose second son, Peter, became a close friend until his death in 1941. Belloc was 52 when Morton met him, and looked older. Both Belloc senior and Morton enjoyed cross-country walking, and improvising songs as they walked; the three of them sailed Belloc's cutter, the Nona. Like Belloc, Morton was a Roman Catholic, and shared many of the attitudes of the Chesterton–Belloc circle. Morton applied his love of the surreal not just to his writing but to everyday life. Walking through Guildford one day with Gerald Barry, Morton stopped at a pillar box. He talked into its opening: \\"Are you alright, my little man? Don't worry, we'll soon get you out.\\" Soon, a concerned crowd gathered to see who was trapped inside. Somebody summoned the fire brigade to help, while Morton and Barry made a discreet exit. Events like this were quite frequent: on another occasion he littered Virginia Woolf's front doorstep with dozens of empty, quart-sized brown ale bottles. Wyndham-Lewis recalls that on their first meeting, the door 'burst open' and 'a thick-set, bucolic figure, all over straw and clay, strode in and banged passionately on the floor with a thick gnarled stick uttering a roar soon known and feared in every pub on Fleet Street: \\"Flaming eggs! will no one rid me of this stinking town?\\"'.  Married life and old age  In 1927 Morton married Mary O'Leary, an Irish doctor. This put an end to his spending time with his drinking friends, and to life in London. To escape the Labour government of the late forties, the couple moved to Dublin for two years, and then to Ferring in Worthing. This moving around didn't interfere with the column, which Morton hand-wrote (never having learned to type) on sheets of blue Basildon Bond and posted to the Express. His new lifestyle did, though: Morton's writing became increasingly cynical, and he became \\"a gloomy little man,\\" in the words of his illustrator Nicolas Bentley. Richard Ingrams, who edited some Beachcomber collections, and appeared as Beachcomber on BBC Radio 4, described him as \\"heavy-going and uncommunicative\\" in his later years. The couple were happy together until Mary's death in 1974; Morton lost his job the year after. His enforced retirement was not happy, and he lived alone, eating mostly bread and jam (Morton couldn't even boil an egg).

For his lasting contribution as a children's author he received the biennial Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1970. He is considered as Italy's most important 20th-century children's author and his books have been translated into many languages, though few have been published in English.Fairy Tales translated Biography Rodari was born in Omegna, a small town on Lake Orta in the province of Novara in northern Italy. His father, a baker, died when Rodari was only eight. Rodari and his two brothers, Cesare and Mario, were raised by his mother in her native village, in the province of Varese. After three years at the seminary in Seveso, Rodari received his teacher's diploma at the age of seventeen and began to teach elementary classes in rural schools of the Varese district. He had interest in music (three years of violin lessons) and literature (discovered the works of Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Lenin and Trotsky which sharpened his critical sense). In 1939, for a short time, Rodari attended the Catholic University of Milan. During World War II, Rodari had a deferment from the army due to his ill health. Due to his precarious financial situation, he applied for work at the Casa del Fascio and was forced to join the National Fascist Party. Traumatized by the loss of his two best friends and his favorite brother Cesare's incarceration in a German concentration camp, Rodari joined the Italian Communist Party in 1944 and participated in the Italian resistance movement. In 1948, as a journalist for the Communist periodical L'Unità, he began writing books for children. In 1950, the Party installed him as editor of the new weekly children's magazine Il Pioniere in Rome. In 1951, Rodari published his first books, Il Libro delle Filastrocche and Il Romanzo di Cipollino. In 1952, he traveled for the first time to the Soviet Union, which he frequented thereafter. In 1953, he married Maria Teresa Feretti, who four years later gave birth to their daughter, Paola. In 1957, Rodari passed the exam to become a professional journalist. Rodari spent the years 1966–1969 working intensively on collaborative projects with children. In 1970 he received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for children's literature, which gained him a wide international reputation as the best modern children's writer in Italian. The biennial award by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. His works have been translated into numerous languages. In 1979, after another trip to the Soviet Union, his health, never very robust, declined and his productivity diminished. He died in Rome, following a surgical operation, in April 1980. Marcello Argilli, Gianni Rodari: una biografia, Einaudi, 1990, p. 64. Cover for C'era due volte il Barone Lamberto. Works He is perhaps best known for developing the story of Cipollino. The story of Cipollino was popular enough to have a ballet staged in the Soviet Union in 1973, composed by Karen Khachaturian and choreographed by Genrik Alexandrovich Maiorov. Cipollino, or Little Onion, fights the unjust treatment of his fellow vegetable townfolk by the fruit royalty (Prince Lemon and the overly proud Tomato) in the garden kingdom. The main theme is the \\"struggle of the underclass and the powerful, good versus evil\\" and the importance of friendship in the face of difficulties.Ballet Theatre of Lancaster * Il libro delle filastrocche (“The Book of Children's Poems”, 1950) * Il romanzo di Cipollino (“The Adventures of the Little Onion”, 1951) * Gelsomino nel paese dei bugiardi (“Gelsomino in the Country of Liars”, 1958) * Filastrocche in cielo e in terra (“Nursery Rhymes in the Sky and on Earth”, 1960) * Favole al telefono (“Fairy Tales Over the Phone”, 1962) * Gip nel televisore (“Gip in the Television”, 1962) * La freccia azzurra (“The Blue Arrow”, 1964) * La torta in cielo (“The Cake in the Sky”, 1966) * La grammatica della fantasia (“The Grammar of Fantasy”, 1974) * C'era due volte il barone Lamberto ovvero I misteri dell'isola di San Giulio (Twice Upon a Time there was a Baron called Lamberto or The Mysteries of the Isle of San Giulio, 1978, ) * Novelle fatte a macchina (“Stories written on a typewriter”) * Atalanta * Piccoli Vagabondi See also *2703 Rodari ReferencesFurther reading *Argilli, Marcello, del Cornò, Lucio, and de Luca, Carmine (eds.), Le provocazioni della fantasia.

Each year, the group holds weekly programs with over 200 students volunteering as tutors and mentors in schools, churches, and non-profits in the Brightmoor, East Side, and Southwest neighborhoods of Detroit. In addition to weekly service-learning programs, the organization also holds two large events. In the fall, The Detroit Partnership partners with community members to bring a large food and clothing drive titled One-Stop Shop to the citizens of Brightmoor and surrounding areas. Also, every March or April, the group routinely brings approximately 1300 student volunteers from the University of Michigan to sites in and around the city of Detroit for a one-day service- learning event known as DP Day. HistoryFounding= The original DP logo The Detroit Partnership, known as The Detroit Project until February 2008, began in 1999 as an annual community service event. The day of service was named Detroit Project Day and took place on April 8, 2000. Since then, the group has grown significantly and has successfully transformed from a single annual community service event into one of the largest organizations at the University of Michigan with nearly 1,500 total volunteers participating each year in various service projects with Detroit community organizations. The initial idea for The Detroit Project is credited to Katie Foley, who was at the time a junior at the University of Michigan and the President of Circle K, an organization on campus dedicated to service, friendship and leadership. From her experiences in Circle K, Katie saw a lack of opportunity for UM students to participate in community service projects with the nearby Detroit community, and, along with fellow UM student Sara Rowe, met with numerous Detroit community organizations to develop projects and events that would be most beneficial to both the Detroit community and UM students. The organization began its work in the Brightmoor neighborhood of northwest Detroit, an area known both for its strong community network and largely impoverished conditions. A DP Day clean-up/demolition site.Thus, the first DP Day, held on April 8, 2000, saw over 400 UM volunteers work at 32 different sites in Brightmoor planting trees and grass seed, cleaning parks, and demolishing abandoned homes, among other projects. In time for the 2000-2001 academic year, The then-Detroit Project retained Katie Foley as a returning Senior, and recruited a leadership team capable of growing the organization. =Expansion and Renaissance= The DP, as it became known in Ann Arbor, steadily grew in its second year. Several smaller 'one-time events', similar to DP Day in many ways, were carried out throughout the year. Still, however, the focus remained on the large service day. The second DP Day, in March 2001, had over 1400 students register and is still considered the largest ever. By 2004, The Detroit Project had grown to include weekly volunteering efforts involving over 20 programs and 100-150 volunteers - metrics the organization has maintained through 2010. In Brightmoor, DP programs expanded into more organizations and made several lasting and special relationships. This led to The DP's inclusion into an enduring neighborhood coalition called the Brightmoor Alliance. One such important relationship was with Pastor Albert Rush at the West Outer Drive United Methodist Church (WODUMC). In 2005, Pastor Rush partnered with The DP for the first time to hold the 1st Annual One-Stop Shop at his Church. This, The DP's second large-scale event, entails the collection of food and clothing in both Ann Arbor and Detroit, extensive effort at organization and sorting of the donated goods, and, finally, the set-up of a department store \\"atmosphere\\" in the basement of WODUMC. On the day of the event, interested community members are offered a personal shopper as an aide navigating the aisles. Having establishing a strong model for service-learning partnerships in Brightmoor, The Detroit Partnership expanded its efforts into Southwest Detroit in 2004. The DP has built strong partnerships with a number of community organizations and schools in this united and culturally vibrant neighborhood. Current service projects specific to the area include adult education, ESL, and work on immigration issues. In 2006, DP Day included sites in this neighborhood for the first time. After years of success The DP had evolved as an organization, and many of its student leaders felt unfulfilled with the specific nature of much of the organization's original language and vision (first in 2006, earlier by various individuals). Thus, on February 20, 2008, The Detroit Project officially changed its name to The Detroit Partnership to better reflect the organization's movement from an organization concentrated on one-sided service events (such as DP Day, where volunteers went en masse to work on projects to which they have never returned) to the development of programs and service learning through more intimate, and longer-lasting community partnerships (i.e. weekly programs). This shift did not mean an abandonment of large-scale service projects or DP Day, however, it did encourage a new frame and focus on most of the group's events. Ultimately, from the perspective of a student volunteer, this focus encouraged education and self-reflection throughout continual commitment (see Service Learning Ideology below). By 2013, the Detroit Partnership consistently provides over 30 weekly service-learning programs with approximately 230 weekly volunteers. =Recent= Detroit Mayor Ken Cockrel speaking at the 10th annual DP Day The Detroit Partnership's 10th annual DP Day took place on March 28, 2009. Over 1000 volunteers from three Universities (University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University), over 30 community organizations, and the surrounding neighborhoods joined together to participate in service-learning projects. The keynote speaker at the DP Day 2009 rally was Detroit Mayor Kenneth Cockrel, Jr.. On April 3, 2010, the second-largest DP Day (per registered volunteers) to date occurred. 1248 individuals volunteered for the event, including individuals representing Wayne State University and several Ann Arbor High Schools. The keynote speaker for the DP Day 2010 rally was to be John Conyers Jr., the longtime representative of Michigan's 14th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Unfortunately, due to dangerous weather conditions, DP Day 2010's outdoor rally was cancelled and Congressman Conyers was not able to speak. Weekly Programs have continued in full force with roughly 150 to 200 volunteers making it to Detroit each week. A related initiative, a DP-wide Education Team, was fully functioning by 2007. This section of the organization (see others under organization), champions Education efforts on the University's campus. Activities facilitated by the Ed Team often include seminar speakers, discussion chats, and food expos to name a few. The Detroit Partnership is currently approved for government- recognized, non-profit, 501(c)3 status. DP Day 2013 took place on March 23, 2013; DP Day 2014 took place on March 29, 2014. The speakers at the latter year's rally included Lloyd Carr. In May 2013, the organization added an Eastside team to its weekly programs. Its first programs will run in the Fall 2013 term. DP Day 2015 took place on March 28. Mission statement On February 24, 2010, The Detroit Partnership's official mission statement was amended to include the ideals of multiculturalism and social justice. This represented an additional shift in the organization's philosophy and kept in line with The DP's recent renaissance attitude, especially with the official adoption of a social justice theme. Changes were made to the mission statement again in 2015. The current mission statement reads as follows: \\"We, The Detroit Partnership, seek to unite the University of Michigan and Detroit by working alongside community partners in the city. As a student-run, registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, we strive to raise awareness, challenge stereotypes, and promote social justice through our service-learning programs and educational events.\\" Service learning ideology As stated in the mission statement, The Detroit Partnership believes strongly in the virtues of service learning. There is no one definition to service learning, however, it is best described as service work combined with an intentional education component. The Detroit Partnership's focus entails: *Establishing and maintaining partnerships with organizations in Detroit, in order to develop structured opportunities for DP members to serve in a variety of capacities. *Reciprocal and meaningful relationships with organizations and individuals in Detroit. *An opportunity at educational and personal growth by giving DP members' proper context for their service. Our education includes various subjects including Detroit history, sociological concepts, current events, urban issues, and effective methods of change. *Providing an environment that encourages members to reflect on their service in order to further assess their experience. Reflection facilitates self-discovery, encourages thoughtful questions, and challenges patterns of thinking and stereotypes. According to The Detroit Partnership's interpretation of these ideologies, the combination of the above goals will result in effective service learning that best serves their partner organizations and university members alike. From a volunteer participant's perspective, the organization maintains that the growth and benefit of DP members should ideally be a byproduct of their service - not the motivation behind their efforts - in order to truly achieve the benefits of service learning. LeadershipOrganization= The Detroit Partnership currently comprises eight teams. Each team has a Director in charge of that area's organization and duties. The DP as a whole is led by an Executive Director who is charged with being the face of the organization both on campus and in the community. Teams are normally composed of between 6-8 members in addition to their Director. Collectively, the seven teams create the larger Planning Team of around 50 members. The Planning Team meets once-a-week and works towards the large-scale goals of the organization. All individuals that give their time in The DP programs at some point throughout the year are considered volunteers. =List of Executive Directors= *1999–2001: Katie Foley *2001–2002: Sandeep Jani *2002–2003: Catie Baetens *2003–2004: Jonathan Gleicher *2004–2005: Evan Major *2005–2006: Jignesha Patel *2006–2007: Cristina Johnson *2007–2008: Tom Szczesny *2008–2009: Ashley Fotieo *2009–2010: Neil Thanedar *2010–2011: Andrew Bahena *2011–2012: Cassie Basler *2012–2013: Kristin Beharry *2013–2014: Samantha Edwards *2014–2015: Talia Gerstle *2015–2016: Alyssa Setting *2016–2017: Jamie Bahoura *2017–2018: Amol Carvalho *2018–2019: Kevin Sweitzer *2019–2020: Lynn Chen Community partners Currently, the DP partners with the following schools and organizations: The DP continues to evolve by partnering with community organizations and K-12 schools that share the same passion for the city of Detroit. *The Brightmoor Alliance *West Outer Drive United Methodist Church *Cesar Chavez Middle School *Gompers Elementary School *Burt Elementary School *Webster Elementary School *Neinas Elementary School *Murphy Middle School *Vetal Elementary School *Harding Elementary School *Brightmoor Community Center *Grandmont/Rosedale Development Corporation *Greening of Detroit Students and community members perform a clean sweep and paint a mural at Artist Village. *Michigan Urban Farming Initiative *Motor City Blight Busters *Northwest Detroit Neighborhood Development, Inc. *Trinity Development Center *Wellspring Center *Latin American for Social and Economic Development (LA SED) *Alternatives for Girls *Shurly Family Learning Center *St. Christine Christian Services *St. Vincent Sarah Fisher Center *Village of Shiny Stars *Public Art Workz *All Saints Neighborhood Center *Woodbridge Community Center *Resource Community Development Corporation Notable DP Day speakers *Kwame Kilpatrick, then mayor of Detroit *Kenneth Cockrel, Jr., then mayor of Detroit *Lloyd Carr, former Michigan football coach *Mark Schlissel, president of the University of Michigan Awards and honors (2000–10) Community Service Award - Center for Campus Involvement *Awarded in 2014 Ally Award - Center for Campus Involvement\\" *Awarded in 2013 Ginsberg Center (at The University of Michigan) Outstanding Community Impact Award *Awarded in 2010 University of Michigan Outstanding Student Organization Award *Awarded in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2009 University of Michigan Program of the Year: Detroit Project Day *Awarded in 2001, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2011 Michigan State Legislature - Special Tribute *Awarded to the Detroit Project on April 25, 2007 by Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and State Representative Gabe Leland LeaderShape Palmer Award and Scholarship, 2000 *Awarded to Katie Foley for founding DP Circle K International First Place Single Service Award *Awarded to Detroit Project Day http://thedp.org/awards.html ReferencesExternal links *Official website *Facebook page *Michigan Daily coverage Category:Service organizations based in the United States Category:University of Michigan Category:Organizations established in 1999 Category:Organizations based in Ann Arbor, Michigan Category:1999 establishments in Michigan Category:Culture of Detroit ","title":"The Detroit Partnership"},{"id":"2005662","text":"The UWF Heavyweight Championship was the premier title in the Universal Wrestling Federation owned by Bill Watts.

Common names include crabgrass, finger-grass, and fonio. They are slender monocotyledonous annual and perennial lawn, pasture, and forage plants; some are often considered lawn pests. Digitus is the Latin word for \\"finger\\", and they are distinguished by the long, finger-like inflorescences they produce. Uses The seeds are edible most notably those of fonio (Digitaria exilis and Digitaria iburua), Digitaria sanguinalis, as well as Digitaria compacta. They can be toasted, ground into a flour, made into porridge or fermented to make beer. Fonio has been widely used as a staple crop in parts of Africa. It also has decent nutrient qualities as a forage for cattle.Gilani, S. S., et al. (2003). Taxonomic relationship of Digitaria in Pakistan. Pakistan Journal of Botany 35(3): 279–282.Gilani, S. S., et al. (2003).New subspecies of Digitaria sanguinalis from Pakistan. Pakistan Journal of Botany 35(3): 261–278. Lawns The prevalent species of Digitaria in North America are large crabgrass (D. sanguinalis), sometimes known as hairy crabgrass; and smooth crabgrass (D. ischaemum). These species often become problem weeds in lawns and gardens, growing especially well in thin lawns that are watered lightly, underfertilized, and poorly drained. They are annual plants, and one plant is capable of producing 150,000 seeds per season. The seeds germinate in the late spring and early summer and outcompete the domesticated lawn grasses, expanding outward in a circle up to in diameter. In the autumn when the plants die, they leave large voids in the lawn. The voids then become prime areas for the crabgrass seeds to germinate the following season. Biological control is preferable over herbicide use on lawns, as crabgrass emergence is not the cause of poor lawn health but a symptom, and it will return annually if the lawn is not restored with fertilization and proper watering. Crabgrass is quickly outcompeted by healthy lawn grass because, as an annual plant, crabgrass dies off in autumn and needs open conditions for its germination the following spring.

These proteins have been shown to have diverse functions in the development of the nervous system and play multiple essential roles in vertebrate embryogenesis including: cardiac development, Schwann cell and oligodendrocyte differentiation, some aspects of neuronal development, as well as the formation of neuromuscular synapses. Included in the family are heregulin; neu differentiation factor; acetylcholine receptor synthesis stimulator; glial growth factor; and sensory and motor-neuron derived factor. Multiple family members are generated by alternate splicing or by use of several cell type-specific transcription initiation sites. In general, they bind to and activate the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (erbB2 (HER2), erbB3 (HER3), and erbB4 (HER4)), functioning both as heterodimers and homodimers. Neuregulin family members The neuregulin family includes: * Neuregulin-1 (NRG1), with numerous discovered isoforms stemming from alternative splicing: ** Type I NRG1; alternative names: Heregulin, NEU differentiation factor (NDF), or acetylcholine receptor inducing activity (ARIA) ** Type II NRG1; alternative name: Glial Growth Factor-2 (GGF2); ** Type III NRG1; alternative name: Sensory and motor neuron-derived factor (SMDF); ** Type IV NRG1; ** Type V NRG1; ** Type VI NRG1; Types IV-VI are proteins with 3 novel N-terminal domains identified in 2004. * Neuregulin-2 (NRG2); * Neuregulin-3 (NRG3); * Neuregulin-4 (NRG4); In mammals, neuregulin family members are the products of 4 genes NRG1, NRG2, NRG3 and NRG4 respectively. The transmembrane forms of neuregulin 1 (NRG1) are present within synaptic vesicles, including those containing glutamate. After exocytosis, NRG1 is in the presynaptic membrane, where the ectodomain of NRG1 may be cleaved off. The ectodomain then migrates across the synaptic cleft and binds to and activates a member of the EGF- receptor family on the postsynaptic membrane. This has been shown to increase the expression of certain glutamate-receptor subunits. NRG1 appears to signal for glutamate-receptor subunit expression, localization, and /or phosphorylation facilitating subsequent glutamate transmission. The NRG1 gene has been identified as a potential gene determining susceptibility to schizophrenia by a combination of genetic linkage and association approaches. ARIA ARIA plays a role in synapse development, influencing the upregulation of acetylcholine receptor genes beneath the endplate after mammalian motor neurons have made synaptic contact with muscle fibres, hence its name ARIA = Acetylcholine Receptor Inducing Activity. Animal models  A study done on mice in early 2009 has indicated that when neuregulin-1\\\\ErbB signalling is disrupted, the dendritic spines of neurons grow but do not fully form. This produced no immediate noticeable changes to brain development, but in adults there was a reduction of dendritic spines on neurons. Glutamatergic signalling was markedly disrupted in the mice as a result of the experiment.

It has an area of 3,300 km² (1300 sq mi). Location The mangroves are found between Ecuador and Peru where many rivers empty into the Pacific and the Gulf of Guayaquil. They fringe the Gulf of Guayaquil and the northwestern Pacific Coast of Peru near Tumbes. They cover an area of . Inland the mangroves transition into areas of Ecuadorian dry forests, Western Ecuador moist forests and in the south the Tumbes-Piura dry forests, which extend into Peru. The Gulf of Guayaquil is the largest estuary ecosystem on South America's Pacific coast. The flat land and high tides result in salt water moving far up the gulf. Average annual rainfall is , but in some years may be as much as . Ecology The ecoregion is part of the Panama Bight Mangroves, a Global ecoregion, which contains the Gulf of Panama mangroves, Esmeraldes-Pacific Colombia mangroves, Manabí mangroves and Gulf of Guayaquil-Tumbes mangroves. =Flora= The ecoregion contains plant formations of mangrove (Rhizophora spp.) forest that are adapted to permanently flooded conditions and the resulting environments, which offer little available oxygen. The Tumbes River is the southern limit for some mangrove species. =Fauna= There 13 mammal and reptile species, including the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) at its southern limit. There are more than 40 species of birds including the Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus), white-necked heron (Ardea pacifica), great egret (Ardea alba), American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), white-winged guan (Penelope albipennis) and horned screamer (Anhima cornuta). Status Large parts of the mangroves have been destroyed to make way for aquaculture, rice farms, housing and industry. Other threats come from mercury pollution from gold and silver mining upstream in the Puyango-Tumbes watershed, urban pollution and dams. In Ecuador about of mangroves were lost in the 1980s and early 1990s due to unsustainable shrimp pond development. Since then the mangroves have been slowly recovering, and seem stable. On Ecuador's side of the mangrove ecoregion, particularly near the cities of Machala and Santa Rosa in the province of El Oro, many shrimp farm ponds have been dug out for export of shrimp to the U.S., Europe and other regions. Shrimp are one of Ecuador's main exports together with crude oil and derivatives, bananas and ornamental flowers. On the Peruvian side some of the mangroves are protected by the Manglares de Tumbes National Sanctuary.

The story is set in the Old Kingdom, under the reign of King Snefru. However, the text should be attributed to an individual named Neferyt, who most likely composed it at the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty. The nature of the literary text is argued upon. There are a number of different theories stating that the literature is a historical romance in pseudo-prophetic form, political literature, religious motivation as well as a literary text created to change and improve the situation in Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty. Content The Prophecies of Neferti is set in the fictional court of King Snefru (c. 2575–2551 BC), who ruled Egypt during the Fourth Dynasty. The sage Neferti is summoned to the court so that he can entertain the King with fine speeches. He is asked to speak of the future rather than the past, the sage prophesies the downfall of the Egyptian nation by civil war, leading to the eventual atonement of the nation through the rise of a great king. According to Neferti this king, “Ameny”, will redeem the chaos, banish enemies, and set all right. Excerpt from \\"The Prophecies of Neferti\\" “The transliteration follows Helck 1970b, using the copy on Papyrus Hermitage 1116B as principal source. The section divisions are those of Helck 1970b: after each section number are given the corresponding line-numbers in Papyrus Hermitage 1116B.” 13 (Papyrus Hermitage 1116B, lines 57 to 61) “nswt pw r iyt n rsy imny mAa xrw rn.f sA Hmt pw n tA sty ms pw n Xn nxn iw.f r Ssp HDt iw.f r wTs dSrt iw.f smA sxmty iw.f r sHtp nbwy m mrt.sn pXr iHy m xfa wsr m nwd There is a king who will come from the south Ameny true of voice is his name. He is the son of a woman of the Land of the Bow, he is a child of the Heartland of Nekhen. He will take up the White Crown, he will raise up the Red Crown, he will unite the Two Mighty Goddesses, he will appease the Two Lord Gods, with what they desire. The field circuit is in his grasp, the oar in the jump.” Background of the Twelfth Dynasty Amenemhat I, who is theorized to be “Ameny” in “The Prophecies of Neferti”, was the first ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty. He “inherited territorial unification, but faced a formidable political task. Kingship had become discredited and locally independent power had become strong. Internal reorganization around a strong central government was the task” (Wilson 275). The history of the Twelfth Dynasty leads scholars to believe that “The Prophecy of Neferti” was written as political propaganda, in order to show Amenemhat I’s claim to kingship. Copies “What survives of the secular literature of ancient Egypt is a small number of texts. It is impossible to establish conclusively whether they are indicative of the scope of the literary production or whether they are the incidental survivors of the adversaries of the time and men. Among the surviving literary texts from ancient Egypt is, “The Prophecy of Neferti”. It has only one complete version, which is portrayed on two writing tablets (Cairo 25224 and BM 5647) from the Eighteenth Dynasty. This complete version is held at the Hermitage Museum in Saint-Petersburg. Although there is only one complete version, there are numerous Ramesside partial copies of the work, over twenty, which is much higher than other well-known Egyptian literature works. The work is theorized to originally date to the Twelfth Dynasty under the reign of King Amenemhat I. Hans Goedicke argues that this literary work was undoubtedly written for contemporaries, who were fully familiar with the current events and in no way for readers of the distant future. Various arguments There is not one interpretation of the prophecy that is widely agreed upon. Rather, there are numerous supported theories based on the interpretations of respected scholars, ranging from simplistic explanations to in-depth critical analyses. The most widely accepted interpretation revolves around the theory that it was produced as propagandistic literature for the newly established Twelfth Dynasty under the rule of King Amenemhat I. This was an early interpretation and numerous others are now considered. Hans Goedicke in his book, “The Protocol of Neferyt”, argues that “the text does not contain a prophecy of future events but is an elaboration of existing conditions in the Eastern border region and potential dangers resulting therefrom”. This, much like all Egyptian history, is a debated idea. It is important to note though, being that it places “The Prophecy of Neferty” in a new light; it takes away the possible glorification of Amenemhat I and instead places the purpose of the literary text, as one used to change and improve the situation in Egypt. Ludwig Morenz added to the debate in 2003 with his book, “Literature as a construction of the past in the Middle Kingdom”. He believes that the only reason historical royal names appear in the text, “is to give the text a flavor of historicity and as being proto-mythical” (107). Morenz goes on to say, the author of the literature text lived several centuries after King Snofru, most likely during the Twelfth Dynasty and concrete historical memory was being re-cast as proto-myth. He also argues that the “prophetic genre of text probably derives from this notion of the possibility of knowing history” (111). A significant point that Morenz makes is that, the literary text could have been composed for the coronation of the King but gradually lost its concrete links with it. There is one key point that both Goedicke and Morenz seem to agree on, that the literature text unarguably laments the decline of Egypt as a country with the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty. The third argument presented is by Jose Perez-Accino. “Description of the land in chaos and turmoil shows clear primeval overtones. Several phrases can be understood as referring to a time before the creation of the world. The vision of Neferty thus seems to present a metaphor in which the time of trouble is related to a time in which creation has reverted into an original chaos and so the process of creation needs to start again” (1498). Perez-Accino compares the rise of Ameny with the creation of the world. His views differ greatly from most scholars; he believes the literary text discusses the mythological founder, Menes, as the king and not Amenemhat I directly, although the description given in the text is valid for both of them. This argument is supported by puns, as well as the idea that the literature is written in primeval and mythological context. If this is true, then from this literary text, Amenemhat I is a new Menes, “who will perform the Gods’ wishes and put an end to a condition which has afflicted the land” (Perez-Accino 1499). With this idea, the Twelfth Dynasty would be comparable to the original creation of the country. See also * Ancient Egyptian literature * Sneferu * Amenemhat I  References  Goedicke, Hans.

The mountain's summit is an alpine zone above tree line, and views of the surrounding high peaks are available in all directions. However, the large numbers of hikers on the summit have in the past caused damage to the fragile plant life, and strict regulations have been put in place both at the trailhead and on the summit (all hikers must sign in; no dogs are allowed without a leash) to protect it. On busy days a Summit Steward both reminds hikers of these rules and educates them about the ecosystem. Less frequently, the mountain is approached from the southeast via the steep, narrow, Boundary Trail from Lake Colden.

It was previously known as Kinghorn Museum, and is located on what was once known as Kinghorn, now subsumed by King City. It is operated by the township Community Services Department. The Museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association (CMA), the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN), and the Virtual Museum of Canada. Campus The museum consists of a building which houses the majority of collections held. This building was originally built in 1861 as the site of the Kinghorn School SS #23. It was updated and expanded in 1958 and again in 1963, and purchased by the township in 1978. The township gave operational control of the building to the King Township Historical Society, which established the museum in 1979 and opened it in 1982. The museum was operated on a volunteer basis until 2001, when the township municipal government assumed control of the museum. The government established a management board, to which individuals are appointed by the township council. In 2012, a addition was built by the real estate development company Genview Homes, which leased it and used it as its sales office for a development adjacent to the museum grounds in exchange for repairing or upgrading damaged parts of the building. The flat, leaky roof was rebuilt as a peaked roof. Once vacated by Genview, the space may be used for various services, such as a lecture hall with a capacity of 60 to 80 guests. On the grounds of the 2.5 acre property owned by the museum are several heritage sites. The King Township Historical Society raised funds to acquire and move King Station from Black Creek Pioneer Village to the grounds in 1989, where it now fronts King Road. It was the original railway station building of Springhill (now King City), and believed to be the oldest surviving railway station in Canada, built by the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway in 1852 and first served passengers in 1853. The single-storey board and batten structure was in poor shape by then, and restoration began soon after to repair the damage. It was painted green and grey after the initial restoration, and is now painted cream yellow with green trim. It is the only surviving station building of the original Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway buildings. The other heritage building is the King Christian Church built in 1851 by local community members with Quaker and Loyalist backgrounds. It was renamed to the King Emmanuel Baptist Church in 1931 and permanently closed in 1978. It was moved from its original location at Kettleby Road and Jane Street to the museum grounds in 1982. Laskay Hall in 2017, before it was moved to the museum grounds In August 2017, Laskay Hall was moved to the site from its original location in Laskay. It will be used for cultural programs such as art, music, dance, and theatre; an event venue for Laskay residents; a performing arts space; and as an additional exhibit for the museum. A basement will eventually be built for it, which will be used for storage by the museum and Arts Society King. The site also contains a dredge built in the 1970s that was used to clear the canals of the Holland Marsh until the 1990s, and was obtained by the museum in 2001. Collections and programs The museum's collection contains over 1,800 artifacts associated with the township's history, such as books, clothing, tools, and other household items. King Township Museum operates a variety of March break and summer camps, and established an Art Camp and Puppet Theatre Camp in 2006. Since 2006, the museum has hosted Music at the Museum, a weekly concert showcasing local musical talent. Works of local and regional artists are also exhibited by the museum. Events The museum conducts several annual events, including a trunk sale, a fundraising antique appraisal, an appreciation barbecue for its volunteers, and a garden tea hosted by the Nobleton and King City Horticultural Society at the beginning of summer. It participates in Doors Open and the Arts Society of King studio tour, and hosts Christmas and Halloween celebrations. The church may be rented for small weddings. One-time events hosted by the museum include a reenactment of the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion, retracing the route of the rebels from Lloydtown to Toronto. The six-hour tour stopped at the rebel statue in Lloydtown, Gibson House in North York, and Mackenzie House in Toronto. Other The most famous person associated with the museum is Walter Rolling, who taught at the schoolhouse for over 40 years. The school was originally one room, but was expanded later. In the late 1970s, the school was converted into what is now the King Township Museum. In 2012, the museum board undertook a program to create a 5-10 year strategic business plan to replace the ad-hoc volunteer administration plan. As part of the project, physical accessibility to the museum will be improved and business hours extended. It will also change the administrative structure to eliminate board appointments by the township council, replacing the board with a community museum board.

He specialized in Oriental and Mediterranean scenes in detailed watercolour or oils, very often repeating the same composition in a version in each medium.Preston He lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, and after his return to England in 1851 he specialized in highly detailed works showing both realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life and more idealized scenes in upper class Egyptian interiors with little apparent Western influence. His very careful and loving representation of Islamic architecture, furnishings, screens, and costumes set new standards of realism, which influenced other artists, including the leading French Orientalist painter Jean-Léon Gérôme in his later works. Unlike many other Orientalist painters who took a salacious interest in the women of the Middle East, he \\"never painted a nude\\", and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes.Tromans, quote 135; 134 on his wife; generally: 22-32, 80-85, 130-135, and see index These, with the rare examples by the classicist painter Lord Leighton, imagine \\"the harem as a place of almost English domesticity, ... [where]... women's fully clothed respectability suggests a moral healthiness to go with their natural good looks\\".Tromans, 135 Early life The Reception, 1873, version in oils, using drawings of Lewis' house in Cairo, which he had left over 20 years beforeWeeks; Tromans, 25-27 He was the son of Frederick Christian Lewis (1779–1856), an engraver and landscape painter, whose German father had moved to England and changed his name from Ludwig. The leading bookbinder Charles Lewis was John Frederick's uncle, and his younger brothers, another Frederick Christian and Charles George Lewis, were also artists, the latter mainly in reproductive engraving, especially after Edwin Landseer (1802-1873), a childhood neighbour and friend of John Frederick. Lewis and Landseer trained together in the workshop of Sir Thomas Lawrence.Preston Initially Lewis, like Landseer, was an animal painter,Preston and he often included animals throughout his later works, in particular a pet gazelle he had in Cairo. He published prints of the big cats in 1826 and twelve domesticated animals in 1826, and painted two large scenes with animals in Windsor Great Park, now Royal Collection (John Clark(e) with the animals at Sandpit Gate, c. 1825John Clark(e) with the animals at Sandpit Gate, c. 1825, Royal Collection website.) and Tate Britain.Preston Travels Lewis toured Europe in 1827, the year he began to paint in watercolour, then travelled in Spain and Morocco between 1832 and 1834. The drawings he made were turned into lithographs by him and other artists, and published as Sketches and Drawings of the Alhambra, made during a Residence in Granada in the Years 1833–4 (1835) and Lewis's Sketches of Spain and Spanish Character (1836). For a while he became known as \\"Spanish Lewis\\",Preston to distinguish him from \\"Indian Lewis\\", his brother Frederick Christian, who went India in 1834 before dying young. Lewis was an early traveller on what was to become a well-trodden route for English artists, though some ten years behind David Wilkie in Spain. David Roberts, who became the other leading British Orientalist, mainly through his lithographs, was in Spain and the Middle East at the same time as Lewis, though the two rarely met, and William James Müller had been in Cairo in 1838. But no other English artist of the period had such a sustained period in what was then the Ottoman Empire as Lewis did on his last period abroad.Trueherz, 68 In 1837 he left for travels that took him to Constantinople in 1840, after Italy and Greece. He continued to Egypt and lived in Cairo in rather grand style between 1841 and 1851, in a traditional upper-class house that he often used as a setting for his paintings. He was visited by William Makepeace Thackeray, an old friend, who described him in the comic account of his travels he published as a \\"languid Lotus-eater\\" leading a \\"dreamy, hazy, lazy, tobaccofied life\\" in a version of local dress that included a \\"Damascus scimitar\\" - Lewis was often photographed in such a costume in later life.Tromans, 26 In 1847 he married Marian Harper in Alexandria.Preston Return to England An Armenian lady, Cairo - The love missive, 46 × 35 cm, oil on panel, 1855. The young woman in the background was reworked as a standalone subject in The Coffee Bearer, two years later. The Coffee Bearer, oil (1857) The Harem - Introduction of an Abyssinian slave, 1860s version In Egypt he made large numbers of precise drawings that he turned into paintings after his return to England in 1851. He lived in Walton-on-Thames from 1854 until his death.Preston; Tromans, 80-81 In 1850 his watercolour The Hareem (now in a private collection in Japan, and rather faded) was a huge hit when exhibited in London, and praised by John Ruskin and other critics. This is in fact the \\"only major work certainly completed\\" in Cairo before his return.Tromans, 132; Preston; Trueherz, 120 He continued to paint watercolours for most of the 1850s, before returning to painting with similar subjects and style in oils, which were quicker to produce and sold for better prices.Preston; Trueherz, 120 He wrote to a colleague: \\"Generally in spite of all my hard work, I find water colour to be thoroly [sic] unremunerative that I can stand it no longer—it is all, all always, rolling the stone up the hill—no rest, and such little pay!\\"Weeks, quoted in note 26, and text In the 1860s his usual practice was to paint two versions of the same composition, in oils (to exhibit at the Royal Academy) and also watercolour, trying to push the price of the latter up to approach that of the former.Weeks, note 30 and text In his technique, \\"Independently of the Pre-Raphaelites, Lewis had evolved a similar method, applying colour with a minute touch on a white ground to produce a glowing jewel-like effect\\".Trueherz, 120 Lewis became an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1859 and a member (an RA) in 1865, and was President of the Society of Painters in Water Colours from 1855, though this was just as he was abandoning the technique for oils.Tromans, 19 (before the biography) The Society did not allow members to exhibit works in oils, which Lewis now wanted to do, and he resigned in 1858.Weeks, note 27 and text Lewis wrote very little, even letters, and when he was required to address the watercolourists as their president at a dinner in 1855, he stood up and after a while sat down again without saying a word. Partly as a result of the absence of sources, no full biography was published until 2014.Tromans, 26; 80-81; see Further reading Lewis continued to paint and exhibit almost up to the end of his life, but in 1873 he seems to have suffered a crisis in his health from which he never recovered before his death in 1876.Weeks, note 34 and text After being largely forgotten for decades, he became extremely fashionable, and expensive, from the 1970s and good works now fetch prices into the millions of dollars or pounds at auction.

She has performed the music of Ethiopia in combination with a wide variety of other genres, often in collaboration with her husband Bill Laswell, a bassist and producer. Early life and career Gigi was born and raised in Chagni in northwestern Ethiopia. She has described learning traditional songs from an Ethiopian Orthodox priest in the family home. She lived in Kenya for a few years before moving to San Francisco in about 1998. Gigi recorded two albums for the expatriate Ethiopian community, but it was her 2001 album, titled simply Gigi, that brought her widespread attention. She had been noticed by Palm Pictures owner Chris Blackwell, who had years earlier introduced reggae to the mainstream through his former label, Island Records. Blackwell and Gigi's producer (and later, husband) Bill Laswell, decided to use American jazz musicians (including Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Pharoah Sanders, and others) to accompany Gigi on the album. The result was a fusion of contemporary and traditional sounds. The album was a critical success internationally and generated controversy in her home country for such a radical break with Ethiopian popular music. This release was soon followed by Illuminated Audio, an ambient dub style remix of the album by Laswell. 2003 saw the release of Zion Roots, under the band name Abyssinia Infinite. Bill Laswell played guitar and keyboard (instead of his usual bass), and several of Gigi's family members contributed vocals. The album was a return to a mainly acoustic sound for Gigi, incorporating instruments such as the krar and the tabla. The track \\"Gole\\" is in Agaw, the language of Gigi's father's village. Gigi's voice can be heard in the Hollywood film Beyond Borders (2003), in which Angelina Jolie portrays an aid worker during the 1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia. She released her Three album, Gold and Wax on Palm Pictures, in 2006. She has also appeared in \\"Running From the Light\\" in Buckethead's Enter the Chicken (2005). In 2010, she recorded Mesgana Ethiopia with Material, released on the M.O.D. Technologies label. Her 2001 song \\"Guramayle\\" appears in the 2006 documentary God Grew Tired of Us. It plays over opening and closing credits.  Personal life  Gigi is married to her producer Bill Laswell. Her younger sister, singer Tigist Shibabaw, died under unknown circumstances in 2008.

It was initially founded as the JDF, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. It later changed its name to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and is now known as JDRF. History JDRF was founded to find a cure for juvenile diabetes; in the 2000s, it broadened its research efforts to include ways to better manage the disease and ways to prevent it. In 2005 the board of JDRF committed to supporting work on medical devices to manage blood glucose, known as artificial pancreas technology. The Board was urged to do so by Jeffrey Brewer, who founded and sold Citysearch, and had become interested in juvenile diabetes and medical devices after his son was diagnosed with the condition. The focus was on integrating continuous glucose monitors (CGM's) and insulin pumps via a computerized program that would use blood glucose levels obtained through the CGM to calculate an insulin dosage to be dispensed through the insulin pump. The first such device was approved in 2016. JDRF has advocated for stem cell research; in a 2004 article in The Wall Street Journal, the authors observed that the JDRF \\"... has become adept at unleashing an army of hard-to-resist lobbyists – made up of determined parents and their afflicted children – on researchers, politicians and potential donors.\\" In 2011, the FDA had made it a priority to clarify the requirements for approval for such a closed-loop monitoring and drug delivery device for T1D, and announced it was preparing draft guidelines. JDRF launched a campaign to influence those guidelines to be lenient. After the first closed loop device was approved in 2016, JDRF lobbied insurance companies to cover it. The campaign also put resources into educating people with diabetes on how to navigate health insurance in the United States, and into lobbying Congress to continue funding diabetes research through the NIH. The FDA lobbying campaign was part of a gradual realignment of the organization to focus on issues other than helping find a cure for JD, but to help treat and manage the disease. This broadened scope meant that the organization increasingly directed its funds to education and advocacy, along with research funding. This included lobbying insurance companies to pay for GCM devices, educating patients on how to advocate for themselves, and lobbying Congress for more NIH funding. The UK arm of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDRF) was founded by Richard Lawson in 1986. In 1988 he became Director. The Foundation is now known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and is \\"the leading global organisation funding Type 1 Diabetes research\\". In 2019, JDRF International appointed its first- ever CEO and President with Type 1 Diabetes, Dr. Aaron Kowalski. Prior to taking this role, Dr. Kowalski served as JDRF’s Chief Mission Officer for five years.http://thejdca.org/aaron-kowalski-named-jdrf-president-and-ceo Research In 2018, JDRF provided $85 million (37% of their total income) to T1D scientific research grants, they provided $156.4 million (67% of their total income) in 2008.http://thejdca.org/2019-jdrf-research-grant-allocation See also *Juvenation * Taste of Tennis, a donor References External links  * Category:Diabetes organizations Category:Charities based in New York (state) Category:Organizations established in 1970 Category:1970 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Non-profit organizations based in New York City Category:Health charities in the United States Category:Medical and health organizations based in New York City ","title":"JDRF"},{"id":"2005764","text":"Tyniec Sacramentarium: Maiestas Domini The Tyniec Sacramentarium is an Ottonian illuminated manuscript written in ca. 1060-1070, probably near Cologne.

His firm made its business handling plaintiff's litigation, including representing clients suing breast implant manufacturers, medical facilities, and tobacco companies. In 2009, O'Quinn, along with his passenger, died in a single car crash in Houston, Texas. BiographyEarly life= John O'Quinn Field at Robertson Stadium by the University of Houston during a football game to commemorate the benefactor after his fatal accident two days prior. Born to Leonard and Jean Wilkes O’Quinn, John Maurice O'Quinn spent his early years in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The family moved to Houston when O’Quinn was a toddler, but his mother, an alcoholic, left the family when he was 4, not to return. O'Quinn was raised in a post-war era bungalow in Houston's West University Place and worked in his father's car garage. He was a top student at Houston's Lamar High School, showing an aptitude in math and science, and enrolled at Rice University, majoring in engineering; however, after being placed on academic probation for \\"three of the six semesters there\\", he spoke with a vocational counselor who recommended career testing to determine the best bet for his future. Q'Quinn reflected, \\"After the test, I was told I was a people person, I liked to help people, fight for beliefs, punish bullies and that I should be a trial lawyer.\\" At the time, the fledgling University of Houston law school did not require a college degree for admission; 90 hours of credit would suffice, so after receiving his father's blessing, he enrolled that fall. O'Quinn graduated first in his class from the University of Houston Law Center in 1967, served as editor of the Houston Law Review, and won a state moot court championship. O'Quinn was such an intellectual powerhouse that he was the first attorney hired from U of H by the law firm Baker Botts. O'Quinn was divorced and had no children. In 1999, the playing field at Robertson Stadium was named O'Quinn Field in honor of his generosity and support of the stadium renovations. After the demolition of that stadium, the \\"O'Quinn Field\\" name was subsequently used for its successor, John O'Quinn Field at TDECU Stadium. =Legal career= Making his name in handling plaintiff's litigation, among O'Quinn's biggest wins were a $1 billion verdict in 2006 against Wyeth Laboratory for its diet drugs, fen- phen, $17.3 billion tobacco settlement for the state of Texas, and $100 million for silicone breast implants made by Dow Corning. In total, O'Quinn is estimated to have won $1.5 billion for his firm. The firm went through several names during the 1990s, among them O’Quinn, Kerensky & McAninch; O’Quinn, Kerensky, McAninch & Laminack; and O’Quinn & Laminack. Pirtle became a name partner in September 2001, and the firm name became O’Quinn, Laminack & Pirtle. According to a 2006 article in Forbes, O'Quinn's firm had pending cases against stock brokers and hedge funds for shorting the shares of weak companies, and against Ford for rollover accidents caused by the Ford Explorer. In the past decade, O'Quinn won, through settlement and/or verdicts, more than $20 billion for his clients. =Death= Around 8:00 a.m. on October 29, 2009, O'Quinn was driving his Chevrolet Suburban on Allen Parkway in Houston, Texas in rainy weather when the vehicle struck a curb, crossed a grassy median and three lanes of oncoming traffic, and crashed into a tree. Both O'Quinn and the other occupant, his assistant, Johnny Lee Cutliff, died instantly of blunt force injuries. Neither man was wearing a seat belt. According to Capt. Bill Staney of the Houston Police Department's Vehicular Crimes Division, the Suburban's crash data computer showed the vehicle traveling at 76 mph just before impact, and that O'Quinn never applied his brakes. The posted speed limit on that section of Allen Parkway was 40 mph. =Car collector= O'Quinn attended an exhibition of Duesenbergs as a child at the Sam Houston Coliseum, to see what his father called \\"the greatest car ever built.\\" In 2003, O'Quinn saw a 1932 Duesenberg Durham Tourister for sale at a Houston auction, at which he bought 14 cars that day including the Duesenberg for $405,000. O'Quinn maintained an extensive collection of cars. The collection had a total value of over $100 million and included at least 618 cars in 2006,\\"The Media Likes Scaring Us, and We Like It\\" by John Stossel at Creators.com and by the time of his death in 2009 he had collected about 800 cars. The collection included: seven Duesenbergs; the 1911 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost featured in the film Titanic; John F Kennedy's 1962 Lincoln Continental Bubble Top limo, and a 1937 Bugatti Type 57 Atlantic. In September 2006, he bought: a 2005 Lamborghini Gallardo covered with 33 celebrity autographs ($500,000); the Batmobile used in the filming of Batman Forever ($335,000), a 1941 Packard limousine used by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ($290,000), a 1938 Talbot-Lago ($3,350,000); and a 1938 Town Car used by Pope Pius XII ($250,000). The centerpiece of the collection is a plain grey 1975 Ford Escort GL, once owned by Polish priest Karol Wojtyla - before he went on to become Pope John Paul II. Bought at the Kruse auction at SEMA, the car was sold by the Pope at auction for charity to Chicago restaurateur Jim Rich in 1995, who paid $102,000 for the car. O'Quinn paid $690,000 for the car October 2005. In late 2006 O'Quinn discovered that several cars were missing from his collection, including a Ferrari 575M and a 1965 Ford Shelby Mustang GT350. O'Quinn tried to get in touch with Zev Isgur, a 32-year-old ex-con whom he'd befriended and entrusted with the management of his collection of classic cars. Isgur was later convicted of embezzlement. On October 10, 2011 a car from O'Quinn's collection which is said to be the world’s oldest running motor car, a historic 1884 De Dion Bouton et Trepardoux Dos-a-Dos Steam Runabout, sold at auction for $4.62 million in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

Life He was born the 2nd son of Thomas Montagu of Hemington, Northamptonshire and Agnes Dudley, daughter of William Dudley of Clopton, Northamptonshire, and Christiana Darrel. He was admitted to Middle Temple on 22 May 1506 and served as Autumn Reader for the Inn in 1524 and 1531. He was appointed Lord Chief Justice of the Court of the King's Bench in 1539, which office he resigned in 1545 when he was constituted Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. He was a member of the Privy Council of King Henry VIII of England, who appointed him one of sixteen executors of his last will, and governor to his son Edward. During the crisis of 1553 when Edward VI wished to alter the succession in favour of Lady Jane Grey, Montagu protested at the illegality of the proceedings. However, when the Duke of Northumberland called him a traitor and threatened him with physical violence, he withdrew his protest.Ives, Eric (2009), Lady Jane Grey: A Tudor Mystery, Wiley- Blackwell, pp. 105, 148. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London on Mary's accession but bought his way out. He bought the manor of Boughton, near Kettering, Northamptonshire and built the family seat of Boughton House on the site. Family He married three times: # Agnes Kirkham # Cicely Lane # Eleanor Roper, daughter of John Roper of Well Hall, Eltham, Kent. He had eleven children (five sons and six daughters) with Eleanor. His eldest surviving son, Edward (1532–1602), was father of eight sons and four daughters, including: *Edward Montagu, first Baron Montagu *Sir Henry Montagu, first Earl of Manchester, ancestor of the Earls of Halifax *Charles Montagu (of Boughton), MP *James Montagu, Bishop of Winchester *Sir Sidney Montagu, MP, ancestor of the Earls of Sandwich His widow died in May 1563.

Debuting with Ultra Q and then Ultraman in 1966, the Ultra Series is one of the most prominent tokusatsu superhero genre productions from Japan, along with Toei produced series Kamen Rider, Super Sentai and the Metal Heroes. The Ultra Series is also one of the most well known examples of the daikaiju (大怪獣, \\"giant monster\\") genre, along with Toho's Godzilla series, and Daiei Film's Gamera series. However, the Ultra Series also falls into the kyodai hīro (巨大ヒーロー, \\"giant hero\\") subgenre of tokusatsu shows. The Ultraman brand generated in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987, equivalent to more than adjusted for inflation. Ultraman was the world's third top-selling licensed character in the 1980s, largely due to his popularity in Asia. References to Ultraman are abundant in Japanese pop culture, much like references to Spider-Man in U.S. culture. The Ultramen As revealed in Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy, the Ultramen are a technologically advanced civilization who were originally identical to humans. They had evolved into their current state of being following the activation of the Plasma Spark, which replaced their dead sun. Ultraman and his many kin are usually red-and- silver (although several color variations have been seen in recent years) and have glowing yellow almond-shaped dome eyes (although there are exceptions to both the shape and color) and various abilities, most notably firing energy beams from their crossed hands and flight. They share a strong cultural sense of justice and duty, a majority of Ultramen joining the to maintain peace in the universe from invaders and monsters. The Ultramen that are sent to other worlds are given Color Timers, or \\"warning lights\\", which blink with increasing frequency and turn from blue to red if an Ultraman's energy supply dwindles or he is mortally wounded. Due to human pollution and the light filtering effects of the atmosphere, an Ultraman can remain active on Earth for a limited span of minutes before their energy is depleted and they die. This forces an Ultraman to either assume a human form or merge with a human host body. The latter process has healing properties that include reviving a recently dead person with their own lifeforce. Ultra beings also appear to be near-impossible to permanently kill, as several times an Ultra being has been killed only to be revived by another member of their species. An Ultra being can be revived with a massive energy infusion, as when Mebius' allies revived him with their energy after his defeat by Empire. Ultramen always try to avoid battles in inhabited areas or near innocent bystanders, and try to minimize collateral property damage. If these concerns cannot be met, a city like Tokyo could be destroyed. The Ultraman phenomenon The show Ultraman was followed by many other series. Sequels to the original series are: Ultra Seven (1967, TBS), The Return of Ultraman (1971, TBS), Ultraman Ace (1972, TBS), Ultraman Taro (1973, TBS), Ultraman Leo (1974, TBS), Ultraman 80 (1980, TBS), Ultraman Tiga (1996, MBS), Ultraman Dyna (1997, MBS), Ultraman Gaia (1998, MBS), and Ultraman Cosmos (2001, MBS). After that the studio tried a reinvention of the hero through the \\"Ultra N Project\\", which involved three heroes: Ultraman Noa (the \\"mascot\\" of the Ultra N Project, who appears in stage shows as well as in the final episode of Ultraman Nexus) in late 2003, Ultraman Nexus (2004, CBC), and ULTRAMAN (2004, Shochiku Productions). This was followed by a return to the old-school series' style in the form of Ultraman Max (2005, CBC). In the course of the Max series, another new hero known as Ultraman Xenon was also introduced. April 2006 saw the 40th anniversary series, Ultraman Mebius, which signalled a long-awaited return to the original universe. Another hero was also introduced: Ultraman Hikari, formerly known as Hunter Knight Tsurugi. The franchise has also been in movie theaters, starting with Ultraman Zearth and Ultraman Zearth 2, Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey, released in 2000, as well as ULTRAMAN, a movie that opened in December 2004. The straight-to-video market also saw the release of Ultraman Neos in 2000, as well as special features for Ultraman Tiga, Dyna, and Gaia, who have teamed up in theatrical features (Tiga and Dyna once, as well as the three of them all together). The Ultraman Mebius and Ultra Brothers movie opened in September 2006. Foreign productions include the 1987 Hanna-Barbera co-production Ultraman: The Adventure Begins (in Japanese, Ultraman USA), an animated movie; Ultraman: Towards the Future (in Japanese, Ultraman Great), produced in Australia in 1991 and Ultraman: The Ultimate Hero (in Japanese, Ultraman Powered), produced in the United States in 1993. The Ultraman series have also been dubbed into various languages, including English, Spanish (only Ultra Q, the original Ultraman, Ultra Seven, Return of Ultraman, Ultraman Great and Ultraman Tiga were known to be translated into Spanish), Portuguese (Ultraman, Ultra Seven, Return of Ultraman and Ultraman Tiga in Brazil), Korean, Malay, Mandarin, Cantonese, Indonesian, and Filipino (Ultraman, Ultra Seven, Return of Ultraman, Ultraman Taro, Ultraman Tiga, Ultraman Dyna, Ultraman Gaia, Ultraman Nexus, Ultraman Max and Ultraman Mebius). Also of note is the American English dub of Ultraman Tiga by 4Kids Entertainment that aired in 2002. The dub considerably distorted the characterization and general mood of the series, and it achieved only limited success. In 1993, Tsuburaya Productions and Toei Company co-produced Ultraman vs. Kamen Rider, a crossover with the original Ultraman and Toei's Kamen Rider. This direct-to-video feature is co- copyrighted by both Toei (and its subordinates, Toei Video and Ishinomori Productions) and Tsuburaya Productions. , Tsuburaya Productions accepts 36 Ultramen as official (counting Ultraman Legend, the combined form of Ultramen Cosmos and Justice, as a separate entity). This figure does not account for Thai-produced Ultramen (the figure is 38 if Next, Noa, and Nexus are counted as separate entities — it has been revealed in Nexus that all three are a single being with various modes used by different hosts). In 2013, the Ultra Series was cited in the Guinness Book of World Records as the record-holder for the most number of spin-off shows. The Ultraman brand generated $7.4 billion in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987, equivalent to more than adjusted for inflation. Ultraman was the world's third top-selling licensed character in the 1980s, largely due to his popularity in Asia. In 2017, Ultraman Ginga S: Showdown! Ultra 10 Warriors!! and Ultraman X: Here It Comes! Our Ultraman were released on January 8, 2017 in the United States as a double feature; this was the first North American theatrical release of an Ultraman feature film in its entire 50-year history. Ultraman Max, Ultraman 80, Ultraman Neos, Ultraman Nexus, Ultraseven X, The Ultraman and other series began airing in the United States on the TOKU channel. The Ultraman manga, which began in 2011, has sold more than 2.8million copies as of 2018. At the Tokyo Comic Con on December 7, 2017, Tsuburaya Productions revealed that an anime adaptation of the manga was planned for release in 2019. It was released by Netflix. Peyton Reed, the director of the Ant-Man films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, said that Ant-Man's costume design was influenced by Ultraman along with Inframan, another tokusatsu superhero from China. It was announced in November 2019 that Marvel Comics has partnered with Tsuburaya Productions to publish Ultraman comic books in 2020. The Ultra multiverse Although the different Ultra series and movies take place in different continuities, that does not mean that they take place in different canons. A major plot aspect of the Ultra Series is the multiverse, which is a collection of countless bubble-shaped universes. This was first hinted at in Ultraman Tiga, and then again in Ultraman Dyna, when the title character gets sucked into a wormhole that transports him throughout the multiverse. The multiverse was first glimpsed in the 2010 film Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial when Ultraman Zero has to travel through it in order to get to his destination. The multiverse has become a bigger and bigger element of the plot over time, and the Ultras are now often seen traveling through the multiverse. In fact, the 2012 film Ultraman Saga takes place in four different universes.

The following are the series which have been released as such: *Ultra Q *Ultraman *Ultra Seven *Ultraman Jack The \\"Digital Ultra\\" re-release order of the series may not match the chronological order in which they were originally aired in Japan. ControversiesLicensing rights dispute= Ultraman's licensing rights outside Japan have been the subject of a prolonged legal dispute between Tsuburaya Productions and Chaiyo Productions (also called Tsuburaya Chaiyo Co. Ltd) based in Thailand. Tsuburaya had previously collaborated with Chaiyo on the production of two movies, The 6 Ultra Brothers vs. the Monster Army and Jumborg Ace & Giant—the latter of which featured another Tsuburaya superhero, Jumborg Ace—in 1974. Sompote Saengduenchai, founder/president of Chaiyo Productions, claimed and maintained that in 1976 that Noboru Tsuburaya, the son of the late Eiji Tsuburaya, had given him and his company a contract which had given him rights to everything Ultraman outside Japanese territories in exchange for a monetary loan. In spite of the fact that the document failed to state clearly and specifically exactly what had been given to Tsuburaya in exchange for these rights, Japanese and Thai courts accepted this contract as real and binding because of the supposed hanko of the late Noboru Tsuburaya, who had died in 1995, in the document. Tsuburaya Productions insisted and maintained that the contract was a forgery (due to factual errors, including the faulty titles of the series in the document, such as Ultra Q being called \\"Ultraman 1: Ultra Q\\", Ultra Seven being called \\"Ultraman 3: Ultraman Seven\\", and Tsuburaya Productions being called \\"Tsuburaya Prod. and Enterprises\\", a name the company never did business under), and repeatedly contested the issue. In the course of the legal battle, Sompote presented photos of himself sharing his photos of Thai Buddhist edifices stating that Eiji had based Ultraman's face on those edifices, a claim which he has continued to hold since the dispute began. No other evidence supporting this claim was known to exist. After an eight-year battle in the courts of both countries, Sompote Saengduenchai was awarded a favorable decision on April 27, 2004. The exact ruling fell into some dispute: Some said it only gave him merchandising rights for the first six Ultra Series (Ultra Q through Ultraman Taro) and Jumborg Ace outside Japan, and broadcasting rights of those shows within Thailand. Other accounts, usually reported in the Thai/Asian media, said that Chaiyo had gained the rights to those six shows everywhere outside Japan. The latter could be taken as Chaiyo's side of the story, as Tsuburaya was reported in the Japanese media to continue taking further action against them. Tsuburaya decided not to market any of the disputed six Ultra Series outside Japan until it had completely settled the rights issues with Chaiyo, although the company continued to merchandise and distribute all of the Ultraman programs created after Ultraman Taro, including the theatrical feature Ultraman the Next, throughout the world. Because of the copyright struggle, importing literature on Ultraman into Singapore and Malaysia was prohibited. It also resulted in a slight backlash against Thai Ultraman fans, who were assumed to be outright Chaiyo supporters. In 2005 the American company BCI Home Entertainment (BCI/Eclipse), a subsidiary of Navarre Corporation announced they had acquired the DVD license to Ultraman from distributor Golden Media Group Inc., a Hollywood-based distributor, who secured the rights from Tokyo-based UM Corp. Inc., acting as the global agent for Chaiyo. A three-disc box set containing the first 20 episodes of the series was released on July 18, 2006, followed by a second three-disc box set containing the remaining 19 episodes was released on November 7, 2006. Both sets feature the Japanese stereo audio, created by Tsuburaya Productions and Pioneer for their Japanese R-2 DVD release in 1999, as well as the English-dubbed version produced by United Artists for North American syndication. The original Japanese monaural was not included. Unfortunately, the English audio for Episodes 5 through 39 were not all complete, as BCI sourced private home off-air audio recordings from an unknown television broadcast, which were cut to provide for more commercial time. Therefore, the episodes in question would switch to Japanese audio from English audio to cover the missing gaps. Due to these gaps, BCI's publicity department assumed the original series was edited by UA-TV when it was originally prepared for US syndication. Only minor seconds of extreme violence were trimmed from three episodes, none of which contained dialogue. Tsuburaya Productions had a complete run of the UA-TV's version, which their Los Angeles Office, UltraCom Inc., retrieved from a US film warehouse in 1993. In 1994, they provided the English audio for the Expressions in Animation VHS release of the first four episodes, which were sourced for the corresponding episodes in the BCI release. During the time of the legal battle, Chaiyo came up with three of their own Ultras: Ultraman Millennium, Dark Ultraman (an evil Ultra), and Ultraman Elite. These were not used for purposes other than stage shows and merchandise. Chaiyo also created a TV series that he called Project Ultraman, un-aired as of late March 2008, a joint project in China featuring their own Ultraman and attaching Hong Kong star, Ekin Cheng to the project. On August 23, 2006, Tsuburaya Productions filed a new lawsuit against Chaiyo for copyright infringement and plagiarism (concerning their three original Ultraman characters), and the court case was taken to China. The Chinese courts in Beijing opened \\"The Ultraman Copyright Study Group\\" in response to the lawsuit. In April 2007, the Thailand Intellectual Property Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions, ordering Chaiyo to cease and desist making commercial profits from Chaiyo-produced Ultraman characters such as Millennium, Dark, and Elite. The defendants were also fined THB 15,000,000 (approx. JPY 50,904,959 or US$428,673.50 c. April 2007) plus interest and attorneys' fees. Project Ultraman went on hiatus as a result of the ruling, which implied that, although Chaiyo owned the right to some of the Ultraman series, it did not own the right to Ultraman and his brothers, including the design. Chaiyo gained permission to merchandise the original series, but lost the right to create and market its own Ultraman, or even use the original, without Tsuburaya's consent. On February 5, 2008, Thailand's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions of Japan after they made an appeal to the initial ruling. The ruling ended the long legal battle by finding Sompote Saengduenchai was not a co-creator of Ultraman. The decision ended Sompote's bid to continue his enterprise, and the court gave Sompote 30 days to stop profiteering from Ultraman. The final ruling saw Tsuburaya Productions as the sole copyright owner. Sompote was also required to pay THB 10,700,000 plus interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent a year starting from December 16, 1997, when the original lawsuit was filed. In 2009, the Thai Intellectual Property Court and the Tokyo District Court both ruled in favour of the Thai company. This led to the Tokyo District Court on September 30, 2010, ordering Tsuburaya Productions Co of Japan to pay damages of 16.36 million yen (Bt5.9 million) to Sompote Saengduenchai of Thailand for violating his overseas copyrights on Ultraman characters. After the announcement of the Dragon Force: So Long, Ultraman movie in July 2017, the dispute on the ownership of the franchise has escalated. But in November 20, 2017, through a Los Angeles court ruling by judge Judge Andre Birotte Jr, Tsuburaya won the lawsuit against Chaiyo and affiliate groups on the rights of the series after the jury concluded that the supposed agreement between Noboru Tsuburaya and Chaiyo was \\"not authentic\\". Despite UM Corporation and Chaiyo filing a counter-dispute, on April 18, 2018, the legal court came to a definite close where a final judgement states that the dispute and the document was deemed invalid, forbidding UMC to use the Ultra Series and all its related characters and forced them to pay Tsubaraya damages for its infringement of its rights.https://en.tsuburaya- prod.co.jp/news/395 With the release of the sequel film ' (), issues between UMC, Bluearc and Tsubaraya had reignited and the company took legal actions against the two companies again.https://en.tsuburaya-prod.co.jp/news/939 In December 10, 2019, it was confirmed by Tsuburaya that the court has rejected UMC and Bluearc's appeal for a retrial, stating the court's first verdict of regarding the rights and ownership of Ultraman to Tsuburaya is still legitimate and final, and that any future appeals by UMC and Bluearc will likely be rejected. As UMC and Bluearc failed to file a further appeal by March 4, 2020, they were to pay US$4,000,000 (approx. 400,000,000 Japanese Yen) in compensatory damages as well as other various court fees. =Malaysian book ban= On March 6, 2014, the Malaysian Ministry of Home Affairs announced that it had banned the publication of an Ultraman comic book Ultraman: The Ultra Power \\"due to contents that were detrimental to public order\\". Social media users later noticed that a page in the book described the character of Ultraman King (from the film Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy) as a god, which in the Malaysian pidgin language Bahasa Rojak is the Arabic word \\"Allah\\". The Home Ministry later confirmed that the use of \\"Allah\\" was indeed the reason for the ban, claiming that the comparison may \\"confuse Muslim children and damage their faith\\". This highlighted the larger ban to prevent non-Muslims in Malaysia from using the word \\"Allah\\" despite its common usage in the Malaysian pidgin to refer to any \\"god\\", as well as a suit from the Catholic Church of Malaysia over its usage.

It is the homeland of the Arab tribe of the Manasir and from them gets its name. Still today the water rapids cannot be crossed by any large boats making the region accessible only via a sandy and rocky desert track. At the height of the Island of Muqrat (N 19°30') the Nile river is blocked from its northward course taking a sharp turn SSW for 280 kilometres before continuing to flow north. In the middle of this S-shape between the Bayudah Desert to the south and the Nubian Desert to the north, the Nile is forced by the topography to split up into a multitude of tributaries forming a fertile river oasis of small rocky islands described by the traveller GRAY (1949:120) with the following words: \\"Whereas usually [agriculture] in the Nile Valley […] is confined to the belt on two banks on which the river has deposited silt, in this cataract area, where islands are scattered like a flock of goats, the number of silt-covered river banks in any given 10 kilometres may be up to a dozen\\". Dar al-Manasir will be successively flooded by the Merowe Dam project.  Extent  The local map of Dar al-Manasir in Shiri Dar al-Manasir is confined by the upstream living Rubatab tribe () in the area of Abu Hamed () (E 33.18°) and the downstream Shaiqiyah tribe () past the village of Birti (E 32.15°), (cf. LAGNAH 2005:2). Dar al-Manasir is covering a distance of approximately 130 km along the Nile with most villages lined up along the left river bank called \\"Western side\\" (…). But the heart of Dar al-Manasir consists of 14 islands, twelve of them permanently inhabited; al-Qanaweit (), Shiri (), Kidir (), Sherari (), Sur (), Us (), Tibit (…), Dumag (), Buni (), Arag (), Dirbi () and Birti (), (cf. SALIH 1999:8, LAGNAH 2005:2).  Climate  View over Marha, Sur Island in Dar al-Manasir The climate is arid with an annual rainfall of about 50 mm in good years. The exact amount and spatial distribution of the precipitation during the rainy season in the months of August until October is highly variable and therefore unpredictable. The rainy season coincides with the flood season of the Nile (cf. SALIH 1999:9).  Economy  Dar al-Manasir as seen from the top of Gebel Us The Manasir pursue small scale agriculture in the immediate vicinity of the Nile. Tiny pockets of alluvial sediments and the seasonally inundated riverside land are intensively irrigated and cultivated. The most important cash crops of the region are dates (cf. Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir). During good rainy seasons, in which grazing grounds are abundant, many male Manasir join members of their tribe in the adjacent Bayudah Desert.  Administration  Sunset over Dar al- Manasir Politically Dar al-Manasir belongs to the River Nile state ( Wilāya nahr an-Nīl). The administrative centre with the only local run police station, branch of the Agricultural Bank and Secondary Schools for both sexes is Shiri () on Shiri Island. Dar al-Manasir is among the most neglected areas in Northern Sudan. Apart from basic educational institutions virtually no public infrastructure such as tarred roads, bridges or ferry boats and hospitals exist. But the Manasir are also aware of advantages of this situation and describe them in terms of exceptional safety and honesty (), tranquillity (), untainted beauty of their country () and cleanness of the water which they drink straight out of the Nile. The landscape, described by Innes (1931:184) as \\"most barren and the most beautiful\\" along the Nile, is rocky, picturesque and referred by the inhabitants happily as \\"our rocks\\" (). Dar al-Manasir with all its villages and agricultural land will be successively flooded in the coming months by the Merowe Dam project. Its residents are going to be moved, but the exact relocation area is still not clear and a matter of ongoing discussion. See also *Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir  References  *Gray, T.

Imagining a black space program, whose \\"blackstronauts\\" were excluded from \\"White NASA\\", the film lampoons Burns's history of the Negro Leagues, a subject of his 1994 series, Baseball. The ten-minute film was produced and directed by Andy Bobrow, who wrote for the television series Hype, Malcolm in the Middle and later, Community. Bobrow later went on to write the Community episode \\"Pillows and Blankets\\", another parody of Ken Burns. It was created for broad release on the Internet. It was nominated for a 2005 Nebula Award but was ruled ineligible because the film \\"did not meet the requirement of professional release, or the 12 month period for nomination (after professional release) expired prior to the film receiving enough nominations to be placed on the ballot.\\" The SFWA stated that the disqualification in no way reflected on the work's quality.  Plot  To impress a girl that he likes, Wallace \\"Suitcase\\" Jefferson applies for a job at the newly formed NASA. Unfortunately, since America's \\"love affair with racism was in full swing\\", Jefferson learns that NASA is whites-only. Undaunted, Jefferson and his friend \\"Loopie\\" Louie Hays form their own astronaut group. Their creation—the Negro American Space Society of Astronauts (NASSA)—is a resounding success, with more than 240 \\"blackstronauts\\" signing up by 1960. The venture also brings personal success to Jefferson—he wins the girl's heart and later marries her. Using spaceships cobbled together from old rocket engines, landing capsules, a school bus, and a used Cadillac, NASSA quickly becomes a major player in the space race. Its members farm out across the country, barnstorming in small towns to raise money and becoming minor celebrities. In Washington, the US government worries about losing the space race to the Soviet Union, but is \\"ten times as worried\\" about losing the race to NASSA. Like NASA, NASSA suffers some significant setbacks. Sullivan Carew dies a hero's death when his rocket-powered school bus burns up in the atmosphere, while Peter \\"Stinky Pete\\" Carver catches fire in an Illinois church parking lot. Unlike NASA, however, the blackstronauts refuse to slow the pace of their program (Stinky Pete is extinguished and makes another launch the following day). The film features a letter from Sullivan Carew to his wife written two days before his death. It is a parody of the real-life letter by Union Army soldier Sullivan Ballou, which was used by Ken Burns in his documentary The Civil War. NASA attempts to lure away those members of NASSA who have light skin and can pass as white, including Gordon Cooper and Buzz Aldrin. When this fails to produce the desired effect, the government issues a \\"black blackout\\" and forces the mainstream media to focus only on negative issues affecting the black community. Soon the newspapers are full of stories about crime and riots, and the achievements of NASSA go unreported. On September 31, 1966, Suitcase Jefferson and Louie Hayes land their rocket- powered Coupe de Ville on the surface of the Moon and return safely to Earth. Their amazing feat is buried by the black blackout, and appears on page 34 of the Cincinnati Enquirer (and, presumably, gets the same treatment in other papers).

Japanese policy from 1914 to 1918 Since the Meiji Period, Japan had been a constitutional monarchy. However, the name did not obscure the fact that Japan's form of government was more akin to an aristocratic oligarchy. In World War I, Japan fought alongside the Allied Powers. In 1915, Japan presented their Twenty-One Demands to China. The demands used the war as a pretense for gaining additional territorial holdings in China. When the United States entered the war in 1917, Japan signed the Lansing–Ishii Agreement, which prevented interference with the Open Door Policy that allowed all nations to engage in commerce with China. With the allied victory over the Central Powers, Japan gained many German possessions in China, including the Shandong Peninsula. Japan also received the South Pacific Mandate from the League of Nations (a precursor to the United Nations) and also actively used the mandate to gain control over various islands in the South Pacific. Japan used economic development and immigration to push their expansionary goals as an empire. Japanese policy from 1919 to 1927 This period of time is widely known as the \\"reconciliation period,\\" during which great riots occurred (e.g., the Rice Revolution of 1918–19), menacing the dominion of government gangs. In 1918, Hara Takashi, the leader of the conservative party Seiyūkai, assumed the position of Prime Minister. He was the first person of modest origins to take this role, and his success was taken as a good sign by Western observers. His success ultimately diminished the power of the feudal government's elder statesmen (Genro) and military leaders. The 1920 elections supported Hara, but Hara was assassinated by a fanatic on 4 November 1921. His Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was then made party president and Prime Minister, serving for seven months before resigning. Two Genro members then dictated the election of Admiral Katō Tomosaburō as the new Prime Minister. Kato represented Japan at the Washington Naval Conference (1921–1922), at which the Allied powers made an agreement fixing the proportional number of battleships that each could possess: five for the United States, five for England, and three for Japan. The Allies compensated Japan with a four-power pact, giving Japan the right of unlimited land armaments without restrictions and protection against Western intervention in East Asia. Kato's program strictly followed the Washington accords, which meant a guarantee of unrestrained Japanese action in the East at the expense of a relatively inferior naval position. Kato's death in 1923, followed by a terrible earthquake that devastated Japan in the same year, made a necessary reorganization and reconstruction of the nation's damaged economy. At this time, one independent party was formed while the following governments included moderate elements. But in 1927, this short liberal period ended when Baron Giichi Tanaka—leader of the Seiyūkai, a minority party in the Diet—rose to power. The Imperial Japanese Army was impatient for control of the Diet while the political class was anxious to gain power over industrial expansion; previously, the rotation of parties in power had permitted each party a turn at benefiting from generous contracts and corruption, leading to an informal accord between them. A whole sequence of scandals, however, led to an appreciation of the Imperial Army's National Feudal Honour Code (Bushi-Do, the War Code), as a bulwark against the fraudulent politics of the traditional parties. The Road to Imperialism in Japan: 1927 to 1931 The more moderate elements, meeting to form the Minseito democratic party, presented a challenge to the military. In 1930, the Minseito Party obtained a decisive majority in the Diet: 273, against 174 for the military followers. Minseito fielded two prime ministers, Osachi Hamaguchi, who was already serving as prime minister since July 2, 1929, and Wakatsuki Reijiro, who took over after Hamaguchi retired due to wounds from an assassination attempt (which occurred earlier on 14 November 1930). Wakatsuki retired on 13 December 1931 after he could no longer control the army in Manchuria. The Seiyukai Party then took control, installing Inukai Tsuyoshi as Prime Minister. The world situation remained unsettled, causing some effects in Japan, which remained in a heavy-industrial crisis. Needing to display some drastic action, the military decided to invade Manchuria. One of the military's principal motives was to eliminate the rising spirit of social criticism and insecurity. In 1925, universal suffrage for men was granted, which led to the formation of the Laborists and the Peasant Party. There were more liberals and radicals in the universities. Very few of them accepted the religious myth about the Mikado as the descendant of eternal ages of Amaterasu Omikami and the religious paraphernalia related to Emperor worship. These Japanese were more modern in their viewpoints on the economy, politics, science, and Western ideas; the militarists and their supporters said they upheld \\"pernicious and dangerous ideas.\\" In reality, power passed to General Sadao Araki, a military man with feudal ideas profoundly hostile to Western civilization. During his administration, the police reprisals and prosecutions of independent and advanced thinkers were reminiscent of the days of Tsarism in Imperial Russia. A large proportion of the intellectual class was detained while books and newspapers were reduced to the authoritarian formula. At the same time in 1931, with some guerrilla opposition, the Japanese conquest of Manchuria succeeded without difficulties. Later, this success and the collapse of organized resistance gained much sympathy for the reactionaries and Nationalists, and in the next elections they defeated the moderates by a majority of two to one. In a display of political mockery of the Chinese Kuomintang revolution, Japan installed the last Manchu emperor of China, Puyi, as the regent for Manchukuo. China reported what they saw as \\"Japanese aggression\\" to the League of Nations. The report of the Lytton Commission created to investigate the incident condemned the Japanese action in Manchuria, motivating the Japanese to declare Manchukuo \\"independent\\". The report declared that Manchukuo remained part of China, but several other countries granted it diplomatic recognition as an independent state before World War II. In February 1933, when the findings of the Report were announced, the Japanese delegation walked out of the League of Nations; Japan gave formal notice of its withdrawal on March 27, 1933. The real drivers of this movement were the generals of the Autonomous Kwantung Army. They applied pressure to have the oldest diplomat in Japan, Prince Saionji, nominated to the Inukai. In the wake of the electoral triumph a wave of political assassinations plagued the nation, aimed largely at ministers still in the cabinet who displayed some independence. In March 1932 ex-minister Inouye and Baron Takuma Dan, a leader of the banking interest Mitsui and one of the most powerful financial figures in Japan, were killed by shooting. These crimes were actions of the Brotherhood of Blood League, formed by a fanatical lieutenant and a Buddhist priest. This and other secret groups, particularly the Black Dragon Society of Mitsuru Toyama, were attractive to the sons of discarded citizens, small merchants and industrialists left to ruin by the great zaibatsus. Their embittered descendants became the backbone of the Japanese Army, many of their officers being of lower rank than the Zaibatsu families. This Radical movement took its ideas from Fascism, combined with right wing socialist elements. It hated the plutocracy but believed in rights for labor and a severely militarized state with strong controls over commercial monopolies and a hierarchical system, leading to the imperial conquest of vast new territories, providing wealth and successful careers for its members. The Assassins of the Brotherhood of Blood are aided, and receiving only some cases. The terror reached its highest point with the assassination of the leader of the Seiyukai, Prime Minister Inukai. This caused industrial concentration and supported monopolies, which raised large sums from loans to obtain the resources for factories and military industries, which rationalized their processes to reduce the low costs of Japanese production. However, the farming situation still continued to be in danger. The taxes on peasants increased significantly while industrialists received economic bonuses. To prevent open rebellion in rural areas, the government allowed some 5,500,000 farmers to organize farming cooperatives as a method of containing their resentment. The Choshu Clan dominated the Army and Satsuma managed the Navy. The unique form of reconciling the claims of older members of Choshu Clan with new elements of the new clan are extended the imperialists conquests in form. But the raising of nationalist consciousness in China and one perspective of united and patriotic China, appearing how one serious menace to any expansion why the militarists and ind considered important. Russian-Japanese successes: 1929–39 The Soviet Union was frequently provoked by the Japanese from 1929 to 1939, but most particularly since 1931 when the Japanese conquered Manchuria. During the 1929 successes, the Japanese blocked the China Eastern Railway en route to Vladivostok. In 1935, the Russians sold this railway to Japan. Then the Soviets raised an industrial center east of Lake Baikal, to augment the railways to Pacific areas. The Soviets also defeated the Japanese in various frontier skirmishes (1929–39). The Russians had an autonomous army in the far east for safeguarding their territory against the Kwantung Army. Japanese pressures over China: 1932–37 In 1932, Admiral Saitō Makoto and War Minister General Araki formed one government with no political parties. Admiral Keisuke Okada succeeded Saito as Prime Minister, continuing the revocation of moderate policy in 1920 when they denounced the then-unpopular Washington Naval Treaty. The Japanese continued to increase their diplomatic pressures over China. The Emperor of Manchukuo gave Henry Puyi the title of Kang Ten; and commenced their advance in North China, threatening Peking and Tientsin. Hostilities began in 1932, with one attack on Shanghai, but the Tanggu Truce (1933) between Japan and China fixed a demilitarized zone at the south of the Great Wall were the Chinese prohibited stationed troops. In 1934, the Japanese challenged China with a sovereign demand over North China, which included Japanese advisers in the Chinese central government. With these successes, the Japanese government called for general elections in 1936. Despite strong police suppression of \\"dangerous ideas,\\" the most moderate party, Minseito, defeated the government with a vote of 205 to 124, and they also gained support from the Labor party. The extremist Militarist party, supported by the Fascists, elected 20 members, or 15% of Diet. Six days after the elections, there was a wave of political assassinations in Japan. Among the victims were Admiral Saito, Viscount Takahashi, General Jōtarō Watanabe. Prime Minister Okada was saved when one of the assassins confused him for another person. The Emperor was alarmed at the magnitude of these actions. The army, concerned about losing control, reorganized itself. Kōki Hirota became Prime Minister, but the Army controlled the War Ministerium. Hirota knew why the Chinese situation would wait no longer. The Manchukuo disillusionment over the economical needs of Japan, still with their railway developed, establishing petrol and coal monopolies and some intents of colonization, the Japanese buying of Soviet Russia of East Chinese Railway, and other developments. But the double way in Soviet line in the Trans-Siberian Railway, and industrial expansion in the Far East and Siberia meant Japan had to go into debt in order to maintain a presence on the Russian frontier. The fight against \\"bandits\\" had a cost in money and lives, maintain for all these country in virtual disorder situation how times of the \\"warlord\\" Chang Tso-lin before at 1928. Diplomatic pressures of Prime Minister Hirota over China caused the Militarists to overthrow him in 1936. Chinese–Japanese conflict and Axis coalition: 1937–41 Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in November 1936, becoming an ally of Germany. The treaty, a provocation to the Soviets, added to a number of incidents between Japan and Russia and Senjūrō Hayashi formed a right-wing government. In the 1937 elections, the Japanese electorate indicated its opposition to expansionism. The government then abolished elections, and Fumimaro Konoe formed a government on May 31, 1937. In July 1937 Prime Minister Konoe began open hostilities against China which escalated into a full-scale, undeclared war the following month. The Japanese called it the \\"Chinese Incident\\" to downplay their invasion. In October 1937, Konoe approved the National Mobilization Law. Since 1935, Japanese leaders had declared the country's intention to establish \\"a new order in Asia\\". China wanted to replace Chiang Kai-shek, and Western interests wanted the Soviets to retreat west of Lake Baikal. The Japanese government and the military proposed the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Despite efforts to \\"put ... the aggressor in quarantine\\" (as Franklin D. Roosevelt said in Chicago in October 1937), the USS Panay (an American river-patrol boat) was deliberately sunk by Japanese Navy dive bombers in the Yangtze River (1938). Two Japanese incursions were made into Soviet territory during the spring of 1938 and 1939: the Battle of Lake Khasan and the Manchurian-Mongolian; both were Japanese defeats. More right-wing activity began when Hiranuma Kiichirō became prime minister and the August 23, 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact rattled Japanese diplomacy. Nobuyuki Abe became prime minister, and the United States denounced the defunct Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Mitsumasa Yonai succeeded Abe as prime minister. In turn, Fumimaro Konoe succeeded Yonai as prime minister and formed a totalitarian, right-wing government in July 1940. On September 27, 1940 Japan signed the Tripartite Pact, primarily directed against the United States. Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka, who withdrew Japan from the League of Nations in 1933, engineered the April 13, 1941 Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact. Special envoy Saburō Kurusu and Japanese ambassador to the United States Kichisaburō Nomura attempted to negotiate peace in Washington weeks before the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese were initially successful in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, sinking the Royal Navy's Prince of Wales and the Repulse three days after Pearl Harbor, invading the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Malaya and Burma and threatening northern Australia and eastern India. Hideki Tojo had become prime minister on October 17, 1941; before his replacement by Kuniaki Koiso on July 22, 1944 the war had turned against Japan in the summer of 1943, except for some aspects of the Chinese campaign.

The Hungate massacre and the display in Denver of mutilated victims raised political pressure for the government to protect its people. Governor John Evans sought and gained authorization from the War Department in Washington to found the Third. More a militia than a military unit, the \\"Bloodless Third\\" was composed of \\"100-daysers,\\" that is, volunteers who signed on for 100 days to fight against the Indians. (Its nickname came from its lack of battle experience.) The unit's only commander was Col. George L. Shoup, a politician from Colorado.All biographiesSand Creek The regiment was assigned to the District of Colorado commanded by Col. John M. Chivington. Early Operations At the Camp Weld Council of September 28, 1864, Evans and Chivington met with five chiefs, including Black Kettle of the Cheyenne and White Antelope of the Arapaho. They had been brought to Denver to parlay for peace under military escort by Major Edward W. Wynkoop, commander of Fort Lyon. The chiefs agreed to peacefully settle their people on the reservation on Big Sandy Creek about 40 miles northwest of Fort Lyon. The reservation was created under the Fort Wise Treaty of 1860. With Wynkoop's assuring their safety, the chiefs settled their bands in a large village at the curve of Sand Creek. Some Indians set up lodges closer to Fort Lyon. On November 5, Major Wynkoop was removed from command and replaced by an ally of Chivington, Major Scott Anthony. He ordered all Indians camped around the fort to the reservation. On November 26, Wynkoop departed for reassignment to Fort Riley, Kansas. On November 28, Chivington arrived at Fort Lyon, having traveled in great secrecy with 700 Third Colorado Cavalry and a battalion of the First Colorado Cavalry. Encouraged by Governor Evans and spurred by his own ambitions, Chivington felt pressure to use the \\"Bloodless Third\\" before the volunteers' terms expired. He sealed off the fort. Officers loyal to Wynkoop were held at gunpoint. That night, reinforced by artillery from the fort and 125 troops of the First Cavalry, Chivington set off for the Cheyenne-Arapaho village at Sand Creek. The Sand Creek Massacre Arriving at dawn on November 29, 1864, the volunteer militia attacked. Although Black Kettle had flown an American flag on his tipi to signal peace (as directed by Wynkoop), the volunteers killed indiscriminately. Historians have not agreed on the number killed, but they often cite 150, mostly women and children, as the warriors had gone out on a hunt. The militia mutilated some of the corpses, taking body parts as souvenirs. Now called the \\"Bloody Third,\\" the regiment returned to Denver in December. It mustered out on December 31, 1864. For months the men displayed the body parts as trophies in Denver saloons. Although Chivington and his forces were lauded by many at the time for a heroic \\"battle,\\" critics complained about the military conduct of the men. In his autobiographical Memories of a Lifetime in the Pike's Peak Region, Irving Howbert, an 18-year-old cavalryman who was later one of the founders of Colorado Springs, defended Chivington, having argued instead that the Indian women and children were not attacked, but a few who did not leave the camp were killed once the fighting began. He claimed that the number of warriors in the village was about equal to the force of the Colorado cavalry. Chivington, claimed Howbert, was retaliating for Indian attacks on wagon trains and settlements in Colorado and for the torture and the killings of citizens during the preceding three years. Howbert said the evidence of the previous Indian attacks on the settlers was shown by their confiscation of \\"more than a dozen scalps of white people, some of them from the heads of women and children.\\"Laura King Van Dusen, Historic Tales from Park County: Parked in the Past (Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2013), , p. 33. Howbert claimed that the account of the battle to the United States Congress made by Lieutenant Col. Samuel F. Tappan was inaccurate. He accused Tappan of giving a false view of the battle because Tappan and Chivington had been military rivals. Aftermath The US Congress investigated the attack. The hearings were widely covered, leading to national shock and outrage about the brutality of the attack and the betrayal of promises made to the Cheyenne and Arapaho. Because the Native Americans believed the Cheyenne had been targeted by the US, major Sioux and Arapaho bands allied with them from 1865 on to attack the Vehos (whites) and try to drive emigrant settlers out of their lands.

The creators initially worked in the employ of DC Comics, but in recent years many have also worked for Marvel Comics. Characteristics of the British Invasion included a greater sensitivity to language, more mature storylines, and a move away from the superhero genre. The invasion led DC Comics to create the Vertigo imprint to target the mature audiences of these writers. History Prior to the start of the British Invasion, DC Comics had imported several British artists from the early 1980s to work on their comic books. Brian Bolland was at the vanguard of this influx. Others that followed included Dave Gibbons, Brendan McCarthy, Glenn Fabry, Steve Dillon, and Philip Bond. The British Invasion itself is often cited as occurring in the wake of Alan Moore's successful run on Swamp Thing and his Watchmen series.Please, Sir, I Want Some Moore / How Alan Moore transformed American comics, by Douglas Wolk in Slate, December, 2003 After Moore had a falling-out with DC and swore never to work for them again, DC editor (later Vertigo Group Editor) Karen Berger recruited many promising writers (and artists) from the UK. The names primarily associated with the invasion include Jamie Delano, who was approached by DC as the writer of the Swamp Thing spin off Hellblazer; Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean, who collaborated on the Black Orchid limited series, as well as the famous and acclaimed Sandman; Peter Milligan, who launched a new Shade, the Changing Man series; and Scottish creator Grant Morrison, whose pitch of an Animal Man series was approved. Later British creators to work on American comics include Warren Ellis, Garth Ennis and Paul Jenkins. Characteristics While some \\"British\\" writers such as Chris Claremont (Claremont was born in England but spent all of his adult life in the United States) had already worked for American comic companies prior to Alan Moore, they are not associated with the British Invasion. One of the chief characteristics of the British Invasion group of writers that set them apart from others was their greater sensitivity to language. Before the British Invasions, writers in the American comic book industry were known as \\"ace storytellers but mediocre wordsmiths\\" because the \\"actual text\\" of their comic books were generally subordinate to the plot and storytelling. With his work on Swamp Thing, Alan Moore revolutionised the American comic book industry through his use of \\"precise, naturalistic dialogue.\\" Another characteristic of the British Invasion was a move away from the superhero genre, although in this regard Grant Morrison was an exception.

Historic preservation usually refers to the preservation of the built environment, not to the preservation of, for instance, primeval forests or wilderness.Maryland Association of Historic District Commissions, Handbook (1997). Preservationist is, however, sometimes used descriptively in other contexts, notably with regards to language and the environment. Other uses of the term Persons who work to preserve ancient or endangered languages are called language preservationists. *Clarification: Ethnologue, a reference work published by SIL International, has cataloged the world’s known living languages, and it estimates that 417 languages are on the verge of extinction. Preservationist is also sometimes used in the natural environmentalist field, but while the natural environment conservationist movements preserve ecosystems and the natural environment, this movement is widely known as conservation or environmentalism. *Clarification: A key difference between the Preservationist and Conservationist environmentalist schools is this: Preservationists view the environment as having intrinsic value that should be preserved by making as little change to it as possible. Conservationists view the environment as having instrumental value that can be of help to people,Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk & Wagnalls, 1936. and generally accept Gifford Pinchot's notion of sustainable yield: that man can harvest some forest or animal products from a natural environment on a regular basis without compromising the long-health of the ecosystem.W.N. Sparhawk, \\"The History of Forestry in America\\" in Trees: Yearbook of Agriculture,1949. Washington,D.C. Preservationism has been defined by Richard Heinberg in his book Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World as distinguishing survivalist groups who wish merely to survive a collapse of civilization from preservationist communities who wish to preserve as much of human culture as is possible in the event of collapse. *Clarification: The idea of preservationist communities is part of a broader strategy in which individuals achieve independence from the centralized power grid, forming sustainable communities that could provide mutual support in the event of critical depletion of non-renewable resources.Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World () (2004; British edition 2005) Notable historic preservationists Some of the notable historic preservationists who are or have been advocates for the protection of the built environment include: * Michael Henry Adams (American, Harlem historian, writer, activist) *Simeon Bankoff (American preservationist and activist) *Katharine Seymour Day (1870-1964) American preservationist from Hartford, Connecticut *Fred Dibnah (English Steeplejack, Mechanical Engineer and Preservation activist) *Ann Pamela Cunningham (1816–1875) American pioneering activist) *James Marston Fitch (1909–2000) American architect, teacher, activist) *Margot Gayle (1908–2008) American journalist, activist) *Jane Jacobs (1916–2006) American- Canadian writer, activist) *Carolyn Kent (1935–2009) American, Upper Manhattan activist) *Charles, Prince of Wales (British activist) *Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (1924–1994) American activist, writer) * W.

Born in Walton Hospital, he grew up in the village of Melling and attended nearby Deyes Lane Secondary Modern. He is the group's only constant member. Career As a solo artist, Sergeant focused on minimalism and atmospherics, and usually released entirely instrumental music. Sergeant's first solo work was in 1978, when he self-produced Weird As Fish and made a total of seven copies. The album was officially released 25 years later. Early in the life of Echo & the Bunnymen, Sergeant recorded La Vie Luonge, a soundtrack piece for a short Bunnymen concert film of the same name. His first formal solo album, Themes for Grind, was released in 1982, while still active with Echo & the Bunnymen, and reached number 6 on the Indie album chart. Performing in 2007 at the Summer Sundae festival. Sergeant continued with the Bunnymen even after Ian McCulloch left in 1988, bringing in Noel Burke to sing on Reverberation in 1990, before breaking up the band in 1993. In 1994, Sergeant and McCulloch reunited to form Electrafixion. The band toured extensively and released one album, Burned, in 1995. After a few singles and more touring, the band began to play a large number of old Echo & the Bunnymen songs at their shows. In 1996, the Bunnymen reformed. Sergeant also returned to solo work in 1997, under the moniker Glide, producing experimental, ambient and psychedelic instrumental music based around keyboard and electronic sounds.Warshaw, Aaron \\"[ Glide Biography]\\", Allmusic, retrieved 9 October 2010 That year, he released the live Space Age Freak Out, followed by another live album, Performance, in 2000. Glide began to tour, and would often open for Echo & the Bunnymen in the early 2000s. Glide released Curvature of the Earth in 2004. Sergeant has guested on Primal Scream's \\"When the Bombs Drop\\" (2006) and Baltic Fleet's self-titled debut album (2008). In 2013 Will Sergeant and Les Pattinson, ex-bass player with Echo & the Bunnymen, formed \\"Poltergeist\\" with former Black Velvets drummer Nick Kilroe. They have been playing live and released an album called Your Mind Is A Box (Let Us Fill It With Wonder) in June 2013. Sergeant told journalist Jon Cronshaw that: “We don’t want to have to stick to the verse-chorus-verse format, because that’s what we have to do in the Bunnymen. We’re trying to do something that’s a bit different, and a bit more open-ended. We can do anything with this project because we’re not governed by any preconceptions about what people expect. If we wanted, we could do a 40-minute ambient nose flute solo if we really wanted, you know? I just like that aspect that we can take it anywhere.” Playing style Throughout his time with the Bunnymen in the 1980s, Sergeant used a black Fender Telecaster with much reverb and delay. This gave the Bunnymen sound a clear, cutting tone. On several occasions during the '80s Sergeant would use a Fender Jaguar guitar. He used a Fender Stratocaster to a great extent on the 1987 Echo & the Bunnymen album. In the music video for \\"Lips Like Sugar,\\" he can be seen playing a vintage Hagström Deluxe 90, (possibly a prop since the performance is lip-synched to the studio track). When the Bunnymen reformed in 1997 he started using his Jaguar as his main instrument with a lot of tremolo. He also uses a Vox 12 string guitar.

It is licensed to New York City, and serves the New York metropolitan area. WXNY is owned by Uforia Audio Network and its transmitter is located at the Empire State Building in Midtown Manhattan. History The station first came on the air on 105.9 FM in 1964 as WHBI. The call letters stood for original owners Hoyt Brothers Incorporated. In the 1980s, the station - by then property of Multicultural Broadcasting - went by the call letters WNWK, and aired leased-access ethnic programming. (This time the call letters stood for NeWarK, its city of license.). In May 1998, Multicultural sold 105.9 FM to Heftel Broadcasting, a company at the time that owned Spanish language radio stations. Under the deal, Multicultural would be paid cash plus Heftel's second AM Radio station 930 WPAT which was running Radio Korea and other brokered programs. WPAT would drop Korea and pick up most of WNWK's brokered shows. Heftel's plans were to flip 105.9 to a Spanish Language mass appeal format of some sort. =Caliente 105.9= In May 1998, 105.9 FM started playing hit Spanish music as \\"Caliente 105.9\\" (\\"Hot 105.9\\"), with the call letters WCAA. Heftel Broadcasting in a corporate deal became known as Hispanic Broadcasting. =105.9 Latino Mix= In September 1999, the station changed its moniker to \\"105.9 Latino Mix\\" (\\"105.9 Latin Mix\\"). Eventually in another corporate deal Univision purchased Hispanic Broadcasting and entered into radio, making WCAA as well as WADO Univision owned. In February 2004, the station's owner, Univision Communications bought the 92.7 FM frequency in Garden City, New York which was the home of WLIR-FM and made it a western Long Island simulcast of 105.9 under the call letters WZAA. (While most New York City FM stations broadcast at 6,000 watts, 105.9 only has 600 watts of power, so 92.7 was used to give better coverage to Nassau County and Queens.) =105.9 La Kalle= On May 27, 2005, WCAA adapted a reggaeton format with the branding La Kalle, which is a fanciful spelling of La Calle, Spanish for \\"the street.\\" The station's HD2 station, which it was launched in 2006, aired the original \\"Caliente/Latino Mix\\" format (The Tropical music format). In the summer of 2006, Univision launched the national affiliates page for its \\"La Kalle\\" stations around the United States, the Mini-Page also includes Quick-Links to live audio streams of other La Kalle stations. Also in mid-2006, the station adopted the slogan \\"Yo Soy La Kalle!\\" (\\"I Am La Kalle!\\"), thus replacing the \\"Reggaeton y Mas\\" slogan from its format change. The new slogan was also part of a nationwide promotional campaign that Univision adopted for most of its other La Kalle affiliates. In late December 2006, the station dropped the \\"Yo Soy La Kalle\\" slogan for the slogan \\"El Movimento Latino\\" (in English, \\"The Latino Movement\\"). In February 2007, the La Activaeda Block and SUBELO Midday Mix switched DJs: DJ Kazzanova ran the 5 p.m. mix programming, and station resident DJ, DJ SpinOne, mixed the Midday Mix; however, some of the DJs were still in the station mixing in club broadcasts and mix shows, notably DJ Presice, who was still doing the Saturday \\"The Show\\" block and DJ Rey-Mo who was mixing on La Kalle during select live club mix broadcasts. In mid-April 2007, the regular La Activaeta Block returned with the same schedule before the Kazzanova-SpinOne switch. On January 11, 2007, Univision dropped the La Kalle simulcast by flipping 92.7 WZAA to a regional Mexican format. The station is now known as 92.7 Qué Buena. In an unprecedented decision by station executives in mid-February 2007, the station started playing more of their old format as opposed to just Reggaeton 24/7. Some of the schedule changes were to blame for this format mix-up. The station aired a mix of Bachata and Salsa, with Reggaeton still being a primary format. These changes had no effect on the mix shows, but DJ Kazzanova played some Bachata/Salsa sometimes during his mix shifts (not \\"SUBELO Reggaeton Radio\\", his syndicated Reggaeton show airing on this station). Also, in a TV advertisement spot, the new format mix was shown when one of the Bachata songs was shown in the ad. These changes culminated on January 17, 2008 when Luis Jimenez returned to New York airwaves with his nationally syndicated morning show, The Luis Jimenez Show, until his cancellation on July 16, 2014, after 7 years because of low ratings. The format was similar to the \\"Latino Mix\\" format that dominated the station before 2005. =Move to 96.3 FM= On July 14, 2009, it was announced that WCAA would move to the 96.3 frequency as a result of Univision radio buying the frequency. As a result, at 8 p.m. on October 8, 2009, classical WQXR-FM moved from 96.3 to 105.9, while WCAA moved to 96.3,Bloomberg News (July 14, 2009) dropped the La Kalle name and adopted a new name on October 15. It had been speculated the imaging for the station name would be \\"X96.3\\", as Univision had registered the domain name X963FM.com, as well as requesting the call letters WXNY. In addition, the RDS text data on car radios was displaying \\"96 X\\".RadioInsight (October 9, 2009) The station stunted with different genres of Spanish music and liners that pointed to the launch of the new branding, which took place on October 15 at 6 a.m.. At that time, the station relaunched as \\"X 96.3\\" with call letters of WXNY-FM. WXNY Previous Logo On May 19, 2014, the station shifted towards a Hurban format. The station also updated its slogan to \\"¡Música Urbana y Mucho Más!\\" On November 9, 2016, the station shifted to Spanish Rhythmic AC format with \\"Super Hits: El Sonido de Hoy\\" slogan. On September 19, 2018, the station updated its to slogan to \\"El Ritmo de New York\\".

Biography After losing her mother at the age of six, Evdokiya Sushkova grew up in Moscow in the family of her maternal grandfather, Ivan Alexandrovich Pashkov. The young girl was very fond of reading and quickly learned German, French, Italian and English. In 1831 her friend Pyotr Vyazemsky published her first poem, \\"Talisman\\", in his almanac \\"Severnye Tsvety\\" (Northern Flowers). In 1833 she married count Andrey Fedorovich Rostopchin, a rich son of the former Moscow commander-in-chief, Fyodor Rostopchin. In 1836 the family moved to Petersburg, where the countess was well received in the high intellectual society of the capital. Her literary work was supported by such poets as Lermontov, Pushkin, Zhukovsky. Ogarev, Mey, and Tyutchev devoted their poems to her. Her popular literary salon hosted such famous guests of its literary salon were Vyazemsky, Gogol, Myatlev, Pletnev, and others. Poems about the unrequited love comprised a large part of her poetry. In 1839 she published a book \\"Descriptions of High Society\\", which was ignored both by the readers and by critics. Although Rostopchina also wrote prose and comedy, these works did not enjoy any particular success. During her trip abroad in 1845 the poet wrote an allegorical ballad named \\"Forced Marriage\\" (), in which she condemned Russia's relationship with Poland. On the orders of enraged Nicholas I, Rostopchina was forbidden to appear in the capital; and till the death of the tsar she lived in Moscow. Rostopchina continued to write poems, plays, and translations, but public interest in her work already decreased. In the last years of her life, she ridiculed various literary movements in Russia; as the result, she found herself in complete isolation. Almost forgotten by the public and succumbing after two years of sickness, Rostopchina died on December 3, 1858.

Joseph Robidoux IV was born in Saint Louis, Mo like six of his seven brothers who survived to adulthood. He was born August 5, 1783. Joseph Robidoux IV was the grandson of Joseph Robidoux (Born in Laprairie, Québec in 1722) and Marie-Anne Leblanc (date and place of birth unknown). He spent most of his childhood in St. Louis, Missouri, where his father introduced him and his brothers Francois, Pierre Isidore, Antoine, Louis, and Michael to the fur trade at an early age. (Weber, pp. 36) In 1799, at the age of 16, young Joseph began accompanying fur traders up the Missouri River.Dictionnaire généalogique Des Familles Canadiennes de Cyprien Tanguay. Pp, 605–609: http://bibnum2.banq.qc.ca/bna/dicoGenealogie/Hugh M. Lewis, Robidoux Chronicles: Ethnohistory Of The French-american Fur Trade, Trafford Publishing, 2004, p. 37-38 Career1803–1822= In 1803, Robidoux's father sent him to organize a trading post at Fort Dearborn, the site of present-day Chicago. His early success there annoyed other traders, who engaged Indians to harass the young man and eventually drive him from the area. During this time he fell in love with the daughter of the village blacksmith, but he did not give his permission for the marriage because according to him some of the Robidoux's had surrendered their soul to the devil In 1805, Joseph's wife of four years, Eugenie Delisle, died. She and Joseph had had two children, a daughter, Messanie, who preceded her mother in death, and a son, Joseph F. Robidoux, who using the given name of Joseph became a trader himself. In 1809, the senior Robidoux established a trading post near the site of present-day North Omaha, Nebraska. He operated his trading post in the Council Bluffs area until 1822, when the American Fur Company bought him out and offered him $1,000 a year not to compete with them. A later post at the North Omaha site was operated by and named for Jean Pierre Cabanné. During the years of the War of 1812, the Robidoux brothers had to pull back their activities to the St. Louis area. In 1813, the widower Robidoux married Angélique Vaudry, with whom he had six sons and one daughter (Faraon, Julius, Francis, Felix, Edmond, Charles, and Sylvanie). 1823–1842 Robidoux returned to St. Louis, where he worked as a baker and confectioner. In 1826, he was hired by the American Fur Company to establish a trading post at the Blacksnake Hills (near the site of present-day Saint Joseph, Missouri.) He remained their employee for four years, at the salary of $1,800 a year, before becoming an independent trader. Built prior to 1830, Robidoux's home was located on the northwest corner of 2nd & Jules Streets in Saint Joseph. The first building in the settlement, the house was later removed to Krug Park as a historic attraction. Robidoux prospered in the years between 1830 and 1843, employing as many as 20 Frenchmen to engage in trade with the Native Americans to the west of his post. When Missouri entered the union in 1821, the state's western boundary was based on the Kaw River mouth in the Kansas City West Bottoms (approximately 94 degrees 36 minutes West longitude). The land where St. Joseph is now located belonged by treaty to the Ioway Tribe and the combined Sac Tribe and Fox Tribe. Robidoux was a licensed trader and legally allowed to be in the area as a trader. Robidoux was the most spectacular example of several enterprising white settlers who encroached on Indian land. Faced with the possibilities of more encroachment, the tribes in 1836 agreed to sell what is now the northwest corner of Missouri for $7,500 to the federal government in a deal at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. It was presided over by William Clark (of Lewis and Clark fame). The transaction, called the Platte Purchase, added an area almost the combined size of Rhode Island and Delaware to the State of Missouri. During this era, one of his slaves, Jeffrey Deroine, sued for his freedom, claiming abuse by Robidoux. Deroine lost the case, but his friends later purchased his freedom, and Deroine rose to prominence for his skills as a trader and linguist, becoming a well-known U.S. Government translator and diplomat. =1843–1868= In 1843, Robidoux hired two men, Frederick W. Smith and Simeon Kemper, to design a town for him. Under Kemper's plan the town was to have been called Robidoux, a feature Kemper thought would appeal to the trader. But, Robidoux preferred Smith's plan, as it featured more narrow streets, thus leaving more land for him to sell in the form of lots. Plans for the town were filed with the clerk of Common Pleas in St. Louis on July 26, 1843. Shortly thereafter, Robidoux began selling lots, with corner lots going for $150.00 and interior lots $100.00. Saint Joseph prospered quickly in the years after its founding, growing from a population of 800 in 1846 to 8,932 in 1860. Joseph Robidoux remained a prominent citizen. His early trading offices are known as Robidoux Row; the complex is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. He led in many development issues until his death, at the age of 85, in 1868. Present-day Saint Joseph retains the downtown streets which he named for his children and his second wife Angelique. Family Robidoux was an early fur trader. He later transitioned into operating a trading post along the route of western migrants, operating a major trading post in the area of Scott's Bluff from 1849–1851. Robidoux had an Indian wife, probably Shoshone, whose tribe would often visit his trading post. His daughter, Mary, married the Ioway chief Francis White Cloud and therefore Robidoux was grandfather to James White Cloud and Jefferson White Cloud, would also be named Ioway chiefs. Joseph was married three times. His first wife was Eugenie DeLisle (1704–1805). Joseph and Eugenie had two children: * Messanie (died early) * Joseph (b. 1802) Joseph’s second wife was unknown, but was said to be Native American. The couple had one child: * Mary Many Days (1805–1884). Joseph’s third wife was Angélique Vaudry, great- granddaughter of Jean-Baptiste Chevalier, one of the early founders of Fort Michilimackinac. Joseph and Angélique had six children that lived to adulthood: * Julius Caesar(1814–1844) * Messanie (13 Aug 1814 - 14 Aug 1814) * Farron Antoine (Faraon) (3 March 1816 – 1840) * François Belvedere (b.25 February 1818) * Felix (5 May 1820 -1873) * Edmond Valentine (12 May 1825) * Marie-Agnés (10 March 1807 – 1900) * Sylvania (10 March 1827) * Charles (10 July 1831 – 1851). Joseph had two illegitimate children with Angeline Caroline Jones. Joseph Henry Robidoux Papst born in St. Joseph, MI in 1853 and Madora Rubidoux Papst born in 1855. Joseph died on 27 May 1868, and was buried at the Calvary Cemetery in St. Joseph. His body was relocated to the Mount Olivet Cemetery in 1908 after the original cemetery was abandoned. Sadly, he did not die a rich man, having a penchant for gambling like his brothers. Roubidoux is the namesake of Roubidoux Creek, a stream in Missouri.

The pruta was introduced shortly after the establishment of the state of Israel, as the 1000th part of the Israeli pound. It replaced the mil, which was the 1000th part of the Palestine pound, a currency issued by the British Mandate of Palestine prior to May 1948. The word pruta was borrowed from Mishnaic Hebrew, in which it meant \\"a coin of smaller value\\". This word was probably derived originally from an Aramaic word with the same meaning. The pruta was abolished in 1960, when the Israeli government decided to change the subdivision of the Israeli pound into 100 agorot. This move was necessary due to the constant devaluation of the Israeli pound, which rendered coins smaller than 10 prutot redundant. This pruta should not be confused with the halachic pruta, which is the minimal value of money for a variety of halachic applications—among them, the minimal value one is obligated to return if stolen, the minimal value needed to effect a marriage, and the minimal investment needed to be considered an investor (it is equivalent to 0.025 gramsValue of Peruta (Hebrew Wikipedia) :he:פרוטה (מטבע עתיק) of pure silver).

Goemon is a thirteenth generation descendant of the renegade samurai Ishikawa Goemon. He is famous for a reticent personality coupled by apparent unlimited skill in martial arts and swordsmanship with his sword , known in the anime as . A partner with Arsène Lupin III and Daisuke Jigen, he tends to join their exploits only on a when-interested basis. Creation Goemon is unique to the series as he was the only character not there from the beginning. Monkey Punch, in an interview featured on the American Dead or Alive DVD release, mentioned he added Goemon later as he felt the manga needed a more Japanese character. As such, Goemon was primarily based on the character Kyūzō, the master swordsman of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai. From the role came Goemon's strict demeanor and fast draw blade, as well as the long-faced countenance of actor Seiji Miyaguchi. Description In the original manga, Goemon first appears as a very dangerous enemy of Lupin in chapter 28 . Lupin attempts to steal Goemon's master's alchemic formula for impervious sword blades through infiltration of Goemon's clan, but his cover is blown by Fujiko Mine, who is Goemon's girlfriend at the time. Goemon tries to kill Lupin over the next several installments, making attempts ranging from hiring assassins as skilled as Daisuke Jigen himself, to entering the service of three martial arts masters, to planting bombs in Lupin's belongings. However, he later decides that he could learn more working for Lupin than against him, and rather abruptly switches his allegiance. His position at Lupin's side is cemented when Lupin ruins the government's case against the man who killed Goemon's uncle, allowing Goemon to take his revenge as brutally and publicly as he wants without having to break into prison to do so. By the events of the second manga series, Lupin trusts Goemon implicitly, and Goemon reciprocates. When a rival of Lupin's captures and hideously tortures Goemon, Goemon refuses to even respond to his interrogation, except to say that Lupin would find him and allow him to take revenge. Lupin then captures and seduces his rival's wife, and uses the information gleaned to rescue Goemon, who slays his captor with Jigen's help. In the original anime Goemon's relationship to Lupin starts off more professional than close friendship. By the second anime series, Goemon has developed a true loyalty to Lupin. However, he easily gets annoyed by Lupin's antics, especially Lupin's infatuation with women and Fujiko Mine in particular. He will occasionally oppose Lupin directly when Lupin's jobs or actions do not agree with his morals. He has even promised that the last act he will take with Lupin is delivering his deathblow. However, Goemon doesn't hesitate to help Lupin in serious situations, and readily assists him any time Lupin works for a just cause. However, in 1978's The Mystery of Mamo, he claims that he helps Lupin simply so he can keep his vow to kill him himself. Goemon has a much more amicable relationship with Jigen. Goemon sees Jigen as a fellow honorable warrior, while Jigen sees Goemon as a trustworthy \\"foxhole buddy\\", and the two are frequently paired together during jobs, and usually help keep Lupin in check. On the odd occasion and increasingly in recent years, Goemon will ally himself with Fujiko, in spite of his distrust of her. Personality A master of a number of classic Japanese martial arts, Goemon excels at Kenjutsu and Battōjutsu. Using his trademark Zantetsuken sword, he has the ability to cut through virtually any substance, even steel girders, automobiles, and multi-storied buildings. His training includes Jujutsu, Aikido and Karate, enabling barehanded vanquishing of several attackers at once with minimal effort. In spite of his invincible sword and his martial arts expertise, Goemon prefers to incapacitate rather than kill opponents. Since katanas traditionally must cut flesh before being returned to the scabbard, Goemon reacts to his non-lethal use of Zantetsuken by exclaiming \\"Mata tsumaranu mono o kitte shimatta\\" (\\"Once again, I have cut an unworthy [worthless] object\\"). Goemon has an extreme sense of pride in his abilities, and when he cannot accomplish a task, feels shame and remorse afterward. Breaking Zantetsuken, as he did in a battle with Flinch in The Mystery of Mamo, is a common cause of shame. He will also show chagrin when he succumbs to his weaknesses, as when a woman ran off with his sword in Memories of the Flame: Tokyo Crisis. On many of these occasions, Goemon will leave to meditate or further train to rid himself of his weak points.Goemon as seen in Episode 0: The First ContactGoemon shows allegiance to Japanese culture as strictly as his traveling and unique lifestyle can allow. He dresses in a hakama and fundoshi, and prefers wearing his hair long and somewhat unevenly cut. He only eats Japanese cuisine, willing to fast rather than settle for any Western options. He is a firm believer in Buddhism and Shinto. Although he may toast with champagne, his drink of choice is sake. He occasionally has been seen smoking a kiseru and usually wears a Sugegasa style hat. While Goemon is traditionally fearless in battle, he shows a boyish shyness when confronted by attractive women. His reaction to viewing a woman in scanty clothing is adverting his gaze and blushing; this embarrassment typically is performed even when in the company of women he has romantic interest for, such as Murasaki Suminawa, his fiance in The Plot of the Ninja Clan. Goemon's most often seen pastime is meditation. Even under threat or when locked up, he is typically seated on the floor in a state of mental seclusion so deep he cannot be budged from his position. Other activities Goemon favors include fishing, attending noh theater, and participating in martial arts competitions. Although typically a person of mellow aloofness, Goemon has been seen exploding with frustration, as well as admiring beautiful women and (very rarely) screaming in fright. Such out of character moments are usually treated as humorous takes. If Goemon has a true weakness, it is that he's a sucker for women. He readily trusts any woman who seems superficially trustworthy or innocent, often landing him in much trouble. At the same time, he fears sultry women will distract him from his training, and tends to blush or flee when any woman puts him in a less than modest situation. Goemon also is very bad with money as well as falling for any scam that states will show the path of enlightenment, and constantly charges Lupin for his services in some fashion. In $1 Money Wars he gives it to the female leader of a cult, who promptly runs off with it. Commonly thought to be just a samurai, an episode of the second TV series (\\"Goemon's Revenge\\") has Goemon visiting his Iga ninja sensei. This episode depicts him as having had the training of a master ninja, perhaps giving some reason behind his willingness to find thievery as an acceptable practice, in spite of his samurai ways. Voice actors Goemon Ishikawa was first voiced by Gorō Naya in the CinemaScope version of the 1969 pilot film for the first anime, while Osamu Kobayashi voiced him in the pilot's TV version. However, Chikao Ōtsuka was given the role when the first anime was actually produced (1971–72). Goemon was taken over by Makio Inoue for the second anime (1977–78), who continued to voice the character until 2010, with one exception. Due to budget concerns, TMS decided not to employ the regular voice cast for the 1987 original video animation The Fuma Conspiracy, with Goemon voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa. The 2011 TV special Blood Seal - Eternal Mermaid marked the first appearance of Daisuke Namikawa as the character and he continues to voice Goemon Ishikawa to this day. Inoue did return to the role once more for the 2012 Lupin Family Lineup short original video animation. William Ross voiced Goemon in the 1979 Toho English dub of The Mystery of Mamo, where his name was changed to \\"Samurai\\". Ross founded Frontier Enterprises, the studio that produced this dub under his direction. Other voice actors include Steve Kramer (1992-3, Streamline), Mark Franklin (1995, AnimEigo). Ardwight Chamberlain (1995, Streamline), Garrick Hagon (1996, Manga UK), and Michael Gregory (2000, Animaze/Manga). Mike McFarland voiced the character for Funimation Entertainment's dubs of several TV specials and theatrical films between 2002 and 2005, and their 2013 dub of The Woman Called Fujiko Mine. Lex Lang voiced Goemon in the Phuuz dub for Pioneer/Geneon's release of the second anime between 2003 and 2006, and reprised the role for Discotek Media's dubs of the fifth and sixth anime as well as Goemon Ishikawa's Spray of Blood. Live film actor The 2012 film Lupin the Third featured TV and film star Gō Ayano as the first live-action Goemon. Originally it was arranged to present the filmed Goemon in contemporary suit and tie with Director Ryûhei Kitamura expressing \\"it would be nonsense for Goemon to exist in current society wearing samurai garb and carrying around a katana.\\" Apparently due to the demand of fans world over, this idea was scrapped and the completed film features Gō Ayano as a swordsman wearing robes similar to his drawn and animated counterparts. Reception In 2007, Oricon magazine polled readers on which characters they would most like to see in their own series. Goemon appeared in the number eight position on the female readers polls, and seventh place in the combined poll.

Early life and education George Bush was born in Pennsylvania around 1779. An only child, he was raised as a Quaker and educated in Philadelphia.Tumwater Research Center. “History and Background of Pioneer Bush Family” , Olympia News, 1945-07-06, Retrieved on 2008-07-13. Bush's African American father, Matthew Bush, was born in India. Matthew Bush worked for a wealthy English merchant named Stevenson for most of his life. At Stevenson's home in Philadelphia, Matthew Bush met his wife, an Irish maid who also worked for Stevenson, and they married in 1778. Pennsylvania did not repeal its anti-miscegenation law until 1780, suggesting that Matthew Bush was either not considered black, or he was married under the care of Germantown Friends Meeting in violation of the law. George's parents served Stevenson until his death. Stevenson had no other family and so left the Bushes a substantial fortune. When he was about twenty years old, Bush moved to Illinois where he entered the cattle business for the first time. In about 1820 Bush moved his cattle business to Missouri where he remained for the next twenty years. Soldier and trapper Bush fought under Andrew JacksonGrier, Patricia E. \\"The George W. Bush You Don't Know: A Real Hero Who Knew How To Get The Job Done!\\" Take Pride! Community Magazine, October 1, 2006 in the War of 1812 at the Battle of New Orleans. (Bush, Jeremiah Mabie and William Rutledge are the only known War of 1812 veterans to have settled in Thurston County, and the earliest known U.S. veterans in the county.) He later worked as a voyageur and fur trapper with a Frenchman named Joseph Robidoux IV headquartered in St. Louis, then spent several years in the Oregon Country working for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). Missouri and marriage About the time Robidoux was hired to establish a trading post at the Blacksnake Hills (which became St. Joseph, Missouri), Bush moved to the area near said trading post and in 1828 purchased (with cash not grant or homestead) 80 acres of land. His property was in an unorganized part of Clay County, where he married Isabella James, the daughter of a Baptist minister of German descent, on July 4, 1830. Missouri was a slave state at the time and had adopted anti- miscegenation laws in 1821, but like his father's marriage, there is no evidence that his marriage was thought to be illegal at the time. Bush was a free man and had never been a slave, but, while he was of African and Irish descent, Missouri did not provide him the same legal status as a white man. It is noted that the marriage was performed by John P. Smith, Justice of the Peace, who may have had an arrangement with Bush. Smith had been appointed Justice less than a month before Bush's marriage, immediately following the formation of Washington Township in May 1830. To qualify for the formation of the township they had to certify to the Secretary of State \\"that there were at least 95 taxable inhabitants in the township upon its creation,\\" including George Bush, whose 1828 land purchase was within Washington Township boundaries. Some sources state that his family lived in comfort there, while others suggest they faced increasing prejudice. Land records show they moved from the edge of Clay County to unorganized territory in what became Daviess County, and finally into unclaimed territory north of St. Joseph. This area was annexed after the Platte Purchase, and organized into Andrew County in 1841. The Bush family left a few years later. The family had nine boys, of which six survived past infancy, including Owen in 1832, Joseph T in 1833, Riley B in 1836, Henry S in 1840, January J in 1844, all in Missouri, and Lewis Nisqually in 1847 in the new territory. To the Northwest In 1844, Bush and his family (along with five other families including his friend Michael Simmons, totalling 31 people) left Missouri, heading west on the Oregon Trail. Bush's navigation skills and knowledge of the western region, gained during his years as a trapper, made him the indispensable guide of the party. Isabella's training as a nurse was an important contribution as well. Bush and his family were also known to be very generous, purchasing supplies for their fellow travelers first in Missouri and later at great expense at Fort Bridger. Bush bought six Conestoga wagons, equipping them with enough provisions for a year, and helped several families make the trip to Oregon. According to the Bush family history, Bush built a false bottom onto his wagon in which he hid over a hundred pounds of silver, worth about $2,000. The great-granddaughter of Bush claims that Bush had hidden $5,000 in silver dollars, some gold bricks, and fifty dollar slugs.Twohy, Emma Belle Bush \\"Memories and experiences at the old ancestral home on Bush Prairie\\" PP. 81-98. With him he brought many species of fruit and shade trees that he would plant in his farm at Bush Prairie.Aspler, Alfred, \\"Mulato founder of Bush Prairie troubled by racial prejudice,\\" Tacoma Sunday Ledger, January 31, 1954. By the time the Bush-Simmons party reached the Oregon Country over four months later, the Provisional Government of Oregon reacting to racially-charged violence had passed an exclusionary law barring black persons, slave or free, from entering the Oregon Territory on pain of lashing. As a result, Bush and his party traveled north across the Columbia River, into territory that at the time was claimed by both the United States and Great Britain. The wagon path they laboriously cut would become the northern spur of the Oregon Trail.\\"History,\\" City of Tumwater official website. Retrieved January 28, 2020. Bush's connections with the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver may have helped the settlers gain access where the company had previously barred Americans from settling. Bush Prairie The Bushes and the other five families established a settlement, named Bush Prairie, at the southernmost tip of Puget Sound in what is now Tumwater, Washington. (Tumwater's official history has been \\"white washed\\" giving almost all the credit for its founding to Simmons and the other white settlers; and mentions only in passing one of the main founding fathers of Tumwater, George Bush) Bush and Michael Simmons built the area's first gristmill and sawmill in 1845, and Bush helped finance Simmons' logging company. Bush introduced the first mower and reaper to the area in 1856.Scott. Leslie M. \\"Soil repair lessons in the Willamette Valley,\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly, XVIII (March 1917), pp 59, 66 In addition to their farm, the Bushes ran a roadside hotel for free. Wayfarers traveling between Cowlitz Landing and Puget Sound liked to stop there. It was open to anyone who came through the area. The Bushes would give visitors a good square meal and gave gifts of grain and fruit grown on the Bush farm. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 ended the joint administration north of the Columbia, placing Bush Prairie firmly in the United States. By staking an American claim to the area, Bush and his party had also brought Oregon's black American exclusion laws, clouding the title to their land; these laws would not have applied if the territory were under the British Empire. When the Washington Territory was formed in 1853, one of the first actions of the Territorial Legislature in Olympia was to ask Congress to give the Bushes unambiguous ownership of their land, which it did in 1855. Bush was thus among the very first African- American landowners in Washington State. According to the Oregon Trail History Library, > The Bush-Simmons Party is credited by some historians as having been in > large part responsible for bringing the land north of the Columbia River—the > present-day state of Washington—into the United States. They established a > presence that attracted other settlers and strengthened the American claim > to the area in later debates between Great Britain and the United States > over partitioning the Oregon Country.Black Pioneers of Oregon. George Bush lived out the rest of his life in Washington. He maintained excellent relations with local Amerindians, many of whom he nursed through epidemics of measles and smallpox. He also extended remarkable generosity towards his fellow settlers, sharing grain with needy neighbors rather than selling it to speculators at great personal profit. One year, wheat was in short supply and Bush was offered an unheard-of price for his entire crop. His response was \\"I'll just keep my grain to let my neighbors who have had failures have enough to live on and for seeding their fields in the spring. They have no money to pay your fancy prices and I don't intend to see them want for anything in my power to provide them with.\\" Bush died in Tumwater on April 5, 1863. Isabella James Bush died September 12, 1866. Legacy Historians have noted how Bush's experience exemplifies the interdependence and interconnection of people from different racial groups on the western frontier, as well as the ugliness of racial prejudice. Their six sons carried on their tradition of farming and public service. The eldest, William Owen Bush, served twice in the Washington State Legislature. In 1890, he introduced the bill establishing the institution that is now Washington State University. In 1973, Jacob Lawrence did a series of five paintings depicting George Bush's journey by wagon train from Missouri to Bush Prairie. The paintings are in the collection of the Washington State Historical Society. In 2009, a Bush butternut tree was planted in Bush's memory on the grounds of the Washington State Capitol, and later also dedicated in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. The tree is a direct descendant of a seedling brought west on Bush's wagon and planted in 1845 at the Bush homestead on Bush Prairie. The original tree is one of the largest, and likely the oldest living butternut tree in the United States. Bush was buried in Tumwater, Washington at Union Cemetery, now a city pioneer cemetery called Bush/Union/Pioneer Calvary Cemetery. The cemetery is listed on the national, state and city registers of historic places.

It is a short text which presents, in some 90 paragraphs, a metaphysics of simple substances, or monads.  Text  The first manuscript page of the Monadology During his last stay in Vienna from 1712 to September 1714, Leibniz wrote two short texts in French which were meant as concise expositions of his philosophy. After his death Principes de la nature et de la grâce fondés en raison, which was intended for prince Eugene of Savoy, appeared in French in the Netherlands. Christian Wolff and collaborators published translations in German and Latin of the second text which came to be known as The Monadology. Without having seen the Dutch publication of the Principes they had assumed that it was the French original of the Monadology, which in fact remained unpublished until 1840. The German translation appeared in 1720 as Lehrsätze über die Monadologie and the following year the Acta Eruditorum printed the Latin version as Principia philosophiae.Lamarra A., Contexte Génétique et Première Réception de la Monadologie, Revue de Synthese 128 (2007) 311–323 There are three original manuscripts of the text: the first written by Leibniz and overcharged with corrections and two further emended copies with some corrections appearing in one but not the other.Leibniz G.W., La Monadologie, edition établie par E. Boutroux, Paris LGF 1991 Leibniz himself inserted references to the paragraphs of his Théodicée (\\"Theodicy\\", i.e. a justification of God), sending the interested reader there for more details. MetaphysicsContext= The monad, the word and the idea, belongs to the Western philosophical tradition and has been used by various authors.There is no indication that Leibniz has 'borrowed' it from a particular author, e.g. Giordano Bruno or John Dee, to mention just two popular sources Leibniz, who was exceptionally well read, could not have ignored this, but he did not use it himself until mid-1696 when he was sending for print his New System.Woolhouse R. and Francks R., Leibniz's \\"New System\\" and associated contemporary texts, Cambridge Univ. Press 1997 Apparently he found with it a convenient way to expose his own philosophy as it was elaborated in this period. What he proposed can be seen as a modification of occasionalism developed by latter-day Cartesians. Leibniz surmised that there are indefinitely many substances individually 'programmed' to act in a predetermined way, each substance being coordinated with all the others. This is the pre-established harmony which solved the mind-body problem, but at the cost of declaring any interaction between substances a mere appearance. =Summary= The rhetorical strategy adopted by Leibniz in The Monadology is fairly obvious as the text *begins with a description of monads (proceeding from simple to complicated instances), *then it turns to their principle or creator and *finishes by using both to explain the world. (I) As far as Leibniz allows just one type of element in the building of the universe his system is monistic. The unique element has been 'given the general name monad or entelechy' and described as 'a simple substance' (§§1, 19). When Leibniz says that monads are 'simple,' he means that \\"which is one, has no parts and is therefore indivisible\\".Burnham, Douglas. \\"Gottfried Leibniz: Metaphysics.\\" Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H8 [accessed May 2, 2016]. Relying on the Greek etymology of the word entelechie (§18), On pourrait donner le nom d'entéléchies à toutes les substances simples ou Monades créées, car elles ont en elles une certaine perfection (ἔχουσι τὸ ἐντελές) Leibniz posits quantitative differences in perfection between monads which leads to a hierarchical ordering. The basic order is three-tiered: (1) entelechies or created monads (§48), (2) souls or entelechies with perception and memory (§19), and (3) spirits or rational souls (§82). Whatever is said about the lower ones (entelechies) is valid for the higher (souls and spirits) but not vice versa. As none of them is without a body (§72), there is a corresponding hierarchy of (1) living beings and animals (2), the latter being either (2) non-reasonable or (3) reasonable. The degree of perfection in each case corresponds to cognitive abilities and only spirits or reasonable animals are able to grasp the ideas of both the world and its creator. Some monads have power over others because they can perceive with greater clarity, but primarily, one monad is said to dominate another if it contains the reasons for the actions of other(s). Leibniz believed that any body, such as the body of an animal or man, has one dominant monad which controls the others within it. This dominant monad is often referred to as the soul. (II) God is also said to be a simple substance (§47) but it is the only one necessary (§§38–9) and without a body attached (§72). Monads perceive others \\"with varying degrees of clarity, except for God, who perceives all monads with utter clarity\\".Audi Robert, ed. \\"Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm.\\" The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy. Cambridge; Cambridge University Press (1999): 193. God could take any and all perspectives, knowing of both potentiality and actuality. As well as that God in all his power would know the universe from each of the infinite perspectives at the same time, and so his perspectives—his thoughts—\\"simply are monads\\".Look, Brandon C. \\"Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\\" Stanford University, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/leibniz [accessed February 27, 2016]. Creation is a permanent state, thus \\"[monads] are generated, so to speak, by continual fulgurations of the Divinity\\" (§47).Translated by Frederic Henry Hedge. \\"Leibniz's vestige view of God's creative act is employed to support his view of substance as an inherently active being possessed of its own dynamic force\\" in David Scott, \\"Leibniz model of creation and his doctrine of substance\\", Animus 3 (1998) Any perfection comes from being created while imperfection is a limitation of nature (§42). The monads are unaffected by each other, but each have a unique way of expressing themselves in the universe, in accordance with God's infinite will. (III) Composite substances or matter are \\"actually sub-divided without end\\" and have the properties of their infinitesimal parts (§65). A notorious passage (§67) explains that \\"each portion of matter can be conceived as like a garden full of plants, or like a pond full of fish. But each branch of a plant, each organ of an animal, each drop of its bodily fluids is also a similar garden or a similar pond\\". There are no interactions between different monads nor between entelechies and their bodies but everything is regulated by the pre-established harmony (§§78–9). Much like how one clock may be in synchronicity with another, but the first clock is not caused by the second (or vice versa), rather they are only keeping the same time because the last person to wind them set them to the same time. So it is with monads; they may seem to cause each other, but rather they are, in a sense, \\"wound\\" by God's pre-established harmony, and thus appear to be in synchronicity. Leibniz concludes that \\"if we could understand the order of the universe well enough, we would find that it surpasses all the wishes of the wisest people, and that it is impossible to make it better than it is—not merely in respect of the whole in general, but also in respect of ourselves in particular\\" (§90).Burnham, Douglas. \\"Gottfried Leibniz: Metaphysics.\\" Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H8 [accessed May 2, 2016]. In his day, atoms were proposed to be the smallest division of matter. Within Leibniz's theory, however, substances are not technically real, so monads are not the smallest part of matter, rather they are the only things which are, in fact, real. To Leibniz, space and time were an illusion, and likewise substance itself. The only things that could be called real were utterly simple beings of psychic activity \\"endowed with perception and appetite.\\"Look, Brandon C. \\"Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\\" Stanford University, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/leibniz [accessed February 27, 2016]. The other objects, which we call matter, are merely phenomena of these simple perceivers. \\"Leibniz says, 'I don't really eliminate body, but reduce [revoco] it to what it is. For I show that corporeal mass [massa], which is thought to have something over and above simple substances, is not a substance, but a phenomenon resulting from simple substances, which alone have unity and absolute reality.' (G II 275/AG 181)\\"Look, Brandon C. \\"Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\\" Stanford University, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/leibniz [accessed February 27, 2016]. Leibniz's philosophy is sometimes called \\"'panpsychic idealism' because these substances are psychic rather than material\\".Pestana, Mark. \\"Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\\" World Philosophers & Their Works (2000): 1–4. That is to say, they are mind-like substances, not possessing spatial reality. \\"In other words, in the Leibnizian monadology, simple substances are mind-like entities that do not, strictly speaking, exist in space but that represent the universe from a unique perspective.\\"Burnham, Douglas. \\"Gottfried Leibniz: Metaphysics.\\" Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H8 [accessed May 2, 2016]. It is the harmony between the perceptions of the monads which creates what we call substances, but that does not mean the substances are real in and of themselves.Burnham, Douglas. \\"Gottfried Leibniz: Metaphysics.\\" Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H8 [accessed May 2, 2016]. (IV) Leibniz uses his theory of Monads to support his argument that we live in the best of all possible worlds. He uses his basis of perception but not interaction among monads to explain that all monads must draw their essence from one ultimate monad. He then claims that this ultimate monad would be God because a monad is a “simple substance” and God is simplest of all substances, He cannot be broken down any further. This means that all monads perceive “with varying degrees of perception, except for God, who perceives all monads with utter clarity” . This superior perception of God then would apply in much the same way that he says a dominant monad controls our soul, all other monads associated with it would, essentially, shade themselves towards Him. With all monads being created by the ultimate monad and shading themselves in the image of this ultimate monad, Leibniz argues that it would be impossible to conceive of a more perfect world because all things in the world are created by and imitating the best possible monad . Interpretation Controversy in rationalism = The Monadology tried to answer two huge philosophical questions—both studied by Descartes—from a monist point of view. The first is about the nature of reality. The second, about the problem of communication of substances, is related to a common objection to mind-body dualism, namely, the body-soul interaction problem. Thus, Leibniz offered a new solution to the mind-matter interaction problem by positing a pre-established harmony between substances: the body is mere perceptions, which are all contained in a soul's complete concept. The soul and body interact and agree in virtue of the pre- established harmony, maintained by God. Leibniz also drew the relationship between \\"the kingdom of final causes\\", or teleological ones, and \\"the kingdom of efficient causes\\", or mechanical ones, which was not causal, but synchronous. So, monads and matter are only apparently linked, and there is not even any communication between different monads; there is only harmony, pre-established and maintained by God. Leibniz fought against the Cartesian dualist system in his Monadology and instead opted for a monist idealism (since substances are all unextended). However, Leibniz was a pluralist in the sense that substances are disseminated in the world in an infinite number. For that reason the monad is an irreducible force, which makes it possible for the bodies to have the characteristics of inertia and impenetrability, and which contains in itself the source of all its actions. Monads are the first elements of every composed thing. = Potential false premise = Leibniz creates an argument that flows smoothly and logically from point to point. If only inspected for validity, an adversary would be hard-pressed to find any errors. He starts his argument out with the groundwork and definitions before using those definitions to build his argument from the ground up, it being a rather unorthodox philosophical explanation. He builds this idea of monads, connecting ideas with logical reasoning and explanation where needed. However, an adversary could be sound in challenging the truth behind some of his claims. Specifically, Leibniz writes a potential false premise in his definition of how monads interact. He states that monads are “endowed with perception and appetite” but cannot interact. This is not necessarily false, but is a claim that he does not backup with sufficient evidence in his Monadology. Typically, this would be enough essentially to throw out the entirety of his argument because it is all built upon this assumption, but in this specific case, it happens to be less problematic, only because the claim is not provable. Monads are a theoretical “simple substance”, so there is no specific physical substance that can ever be known as a monad, since there could always be an unknown simpler substance inside. This means that interactions among monads, or lack thereof, can never be proven or disproven since it can never be proven that it is, in fact, monads that are being examined. That is why Leibniz’s argument for monads must be taken with a grain of salt, but still can be taken in the first place. = Substances simpler than monads = Monads are too complex to be the simplest substance in the universe. For example, the quality of perception takes pages to explain. Yet, Leibniz predicts this argument and writes, “monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things” Leibniz, Gottfried W. The Monadology (1714). Translated by Robert Latta, 1898.. And, while that may be true, the simplest substance only needs to contain one quality, “existence”, to fulfill the role. Take, for instance, Occam’s Razor which states that the simplest answer is usually the correct one Baker, Alan. “Simplicity.” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University, 20 Dec. 2016, plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/.. Compare it to Monadology. Either the simplest substance is something which contains multiple attributes, or it is something which contains only one attribute (ie. Existence). Following this logic, it is plain to see that the latter is more likely to be the simplest substance. As monads are the former, they cannot be the simplest substance. The problem is that when there are qualities, there must be something to bind the qualities together. Locke calls this binding matter substantia Jones, Jan- Erik. “Locke on Real Essence.” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University, 4 Sept. 2018, plato.stanford.edu/entries/real-essence/. meaning the support that attaches qualities to the object. Monads, containing a handful of attributes, require metaphorical adhesive or substantia, to stick the attributes to the monad. But, with the addition of such adhesive, they are rendered merely a substance and not the simplest substance. A truly simple substance does not need substantia as it merely exists. Existence is its entire being and its only quality. Essentially, this critique rests on the idea of Quantitative Ontological Parsimony, meaning that because the theory that there exists something simpler than monads is more basic in nature and postulates fewer entities, it ought to be preferred Fitzpatrick, Simon. “Simplicity in the Philosophy of Science.” Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, John Carroll University, www.iep.utm.edu/simplici/.. So, in so far as Leibniz places additional characteristics and attributes on monads, the search for the simplest substance continues. = Philosophical conclusions = This theory leads to: 1\\\\. Idealism, since it denies things in themselves (besides monads) and multiplies them in different points of view. Monads are \\"perpetual living mirrors of the universe.\\" 2\\\\. Metaphysical optimism, through the principle of sufficient reason, developed as follows: a) Everything exists according to a reason (by the axiom \\"Nothing arises from nothing\\"); b) Everything which exists has a sufficient reason to exist; c) Everything which exists is better than anything nonexistent (by the first point: since it is more rational, it also has more reality), and, consequently, it is the best possible being in the best of all possible worlds (by the axiom: \\"That which contains more reality is better than that which contains less reality\\").

The lead character, Colonel Steve Austin, became an iconic 1970s television science fiction action hero, portrayed by American actor Lee Majors, in American television series The Six Million Dollar Man, which aired on the ABC network as a regular series for five seasons from 1974 to 1978. In the television series, Steve Austin takes on special high-risk government missions using his superhuman bionic powers. The television character Steve Austin became a pop culture icon of the 1970s. The Six Million Dollar Man television series had as its original working title during pre-production the Martin Caidin novel Cyborg title. Caidin's version of Steve Austin appeared in only four original novels unrelated to the television series continuity: Cyborg, Operation Nuke, High Crystal, and Cyborg IV. Following The Six Million Dollar Man television series, Lee Majors reprised the role of Colonel Steve Austin in several bionic-themed reunion television movies in the late 1980s and 1990s. Background As originally conceived by Caidin, Austin is a former US Army helicopter pilot who served in Vietnam before transferring to the Air Force and then into NASA. As backup Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 17, he became one of twelve astronauts to walk on the moon when the primary lunar module pilot broke an arm before launch. In the pilot episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, Austin's background is adjusted: he is a civilian test pilot who was the only civilian to walk on the moon. In the regular series, however, Austin once again became a military man, holding the rank of colonel in the Air Force. In the episode \\"Pilot Error\\" Austin is shown to be wearing both the Vietnam Service Medal and the Vietnam Campaign Medal on his dress uniform, implying that he is a Vietnam veteran. In both versions of his origin, Austin is testing an experimental lifting body aircraft when a malfunction causes a crash. Austin's injuries are severe: both legs and one arm are lost, and he is also blinded in one eye and his skull is fractured (the TV version does not suffer the skull injury). One of Austin's best friends is Dr. Rudy Wells, a doctor and scientist who is a specialist in the newly emerging field of bionics; unknown to Wells, a secret American government intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic Operations (OSO; later changed to Office of Scientific Intelligence or OSI for TV) has been looking at a way of reducing agent casualties. Their solution is to take a severely injured man, rebuild him with bionics, and create a cyborg—part man, part machine. Wells is ordered to perform the procedure on Austin, who expresses a desire to commit suicide after learning about the loss of his limbs. As cyborg The operation to rebuild him costs $6 million ($36 million in 2018 dollars). Bionics are used to replace Austin's arm (his left in Caidin's original story; his right in the TV version) and both legs. Austin's eye is also replaced. Caidin and the TV series treat this differently; Caidin's Austin receives a sophisticated miniature camera (activated by pressing a hidden shutter implanted under Austin's skin after which the eye has to be removed before development of the film) but otherwise remains blinded in that eye, while the television version not only restores sight but also has extreme telescopic magnification and infrared capabilities. His legs and arm provide Austin with superhuman speed, strength, and endurance (the latter because, Caidin writes, Austin's heart and lungs only need to power his torso, head and remaining arm). Caidin's character also had some additional bionic parts his TV counterpart lacked, such as a steel-reinforced skull, a poison dart gun built into one of his bionic fingers, and a radio transmitter built into a rib. Another big distinction between Caidin's original and his television counterpart is the extent to which the bionics could supply strength and speed. In the former, Austin's strength and speed were limited by the physical abilities of the connecting human parts. For instance, Austin could run faster than the best Olympic athlete, whereas the TV character could run 60 MPH. Caidin himself satirized the TV series' unrealistic science in another novel, ManFac. Both versions of the character are subsequently recruited into the OSO/OSI as a secret agent (and as an ongoing test subject for bionics). Austin becomes a top agent, traveling the world to fight everything from terrorism (the most common target of the literary version of the character) to even alien invasion on television. As a military officer he remains an active member of the NASA Astronaut Corps, but the media describes his command of the Athena Rescue mission (necessary because his bionic strength is needed) as a surprise. Austin is obscure enough to usually maintain his anonymity, and uses his astronaut status to establish credibility when necessary. Austin's personality was altered in the TV series. In the books, Austin was capable of being cold-blooded and did not hesitate to use his powers to kill if necessary. Yet in the TV pilot, Austin is initially hesitant to work for the OSI because, he says, \\"I don't want to kill people,\\" although he appears to do just that in the subsequent mission. After the show's first season, however, Austin was usually not shown killing anyone. In Caidin's novels, Austin's superior is OSO chief Oscar Goldman. Goldman was replaced by another character, Oliver Spencer, in the TV pilot film, but appeared in the regular series. The relationship between the TV version of Austin and Oscar was much friendlier than the literary counterpart, although numerous episodes show Austin being frustrated at being a \\"bionic lap dog\\" for the OSI. Backstory Austin's backstory is barely described by Caidin. The TV series, however, introduced his mother and stepfather (of Ojai, California, which has a sign informing visitors of its famous astronaut native), and eventually, a fiancée, Jaime Sommers, who later became bionic after a skydiving accident, leading to a spin-off series, The Bionic Woman. Lee Majors made frequent guest appearances on the spin-off series, which springboarded from Jaime being brought back to life after her bionics failed; a consequence of this was she lost all memory of her relationship to Austin. Both The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman went off the air in 1978. A later episode reveals that Austin's biological father was also an Air Force pilot and was killed in the crash of his C-47 Skytrain in the China-Burma-India Theater during World War II. Further details about Austin's later life were filled in during three made-for-TV reunion movies that aired between 1987 and 1994. In the first (The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman), which takes place several years after Austin retires from the OSI, it is revealed that he had a son, Michael, born in the mid-1960s. His mother is not identified. Michael subsequently suffers traumatic injuries in a crash similar to that which his father experienced, and undergoes bionic rebuilding which renders him more powerful than his bionic father. In exchange for Michael's operation, Austin agrees to return to OSI and his son also becomes an operative, though he did not appear in any subsequent films. In the second film, Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman, Austin is shown to be a senior OSI operative helping thwart a terrorist attack against an athletic event in Canada. Bionic Ever After?, the final reunion film, saw Austin's bionics malfunctioning due to a computer virus, but in the end he is rescued by Jaime and the two finally marry as the film ends. Unlike Jaime, who undergoes an upgrade to her bionics in Bionic Ever After? which apparently adds new abilities, no such upgrade was ever evidenced for Austin in the telefilms, with the exception of an apparent enhancement to his bionic eye which is illustrated in Bionic Ever After?. Notes # While the subsequent Six Million Dollar Man TV series also identified Austin's mission as Apollo 17, there were also contradictory names given at other times. In the 1973 pilot telefilm, Wine, Women and War, Austin's flight is identified in dialogue as Apollo 19. Later, when the original Six Million Dollar Man telefilm (based upon the Cyborg novel) was reedited for syndication as a two-part episode entitled \\"The Moon and the Desert\\", a prologue was added that identified Austin's flight by the name. \\"The Rescue of Athena One\\" says that Austin's Skylab Rescue mission will be his first trip to space since walking on the moon in January 1972, a date between Apollo 15 and Apollo 16. # In real life, Harrison Schmitt, the prime LMP, did not need to be replaced by the backup LMP, Charles Duke, who had already walked on the Moon as part of the Apollo 16 crew. # The name of the lifting body varies. In the Cyborg novel (and sequel books) and the later telefilm Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman, the aircraft is identified as the M3-F5. In the Six Million Dollar Man episode, \\"The Deadly Replay\\", it is identified as the real-life Northrop HL-10. The actual footage used in the original telefilm (and subsequently in the opening credits of the series) was of both an HL-10 and the crash of an M2-F2. At no point in the original telefilm or later series was Austin's aircraft ever identified in dialogue as the M2-F2.

It is a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It was built in 1430 by the Neville family (see Earl of Westmorland) but was never completed. The impressive three-storey gatehouse remains, together with part of a curtain wall into which has been incorporated a much later house (Grade II listed). King Henry VI took refuge in Bywell Castle after the Battle of Hexham in 1464.Northumberland County History The Castle is privately owned and not normally open to visitors. It is the seat of the Viscounts Allendale. Bywell Castle gave its name to a ship, which ploughed into the SS Princess Alice on the River Thames in September 1878, sinking her within minutes. The number of lives lost in the disaster are unclear but estimates have ranged from 590 to 640. References *Fry, Plantagenet Somerset, The David & Charles Book of Castles, David & Charles, 1980.

Life Marjoribanks was the son of Edward Marjoribanks of Greenlands who was a senior partner in Coutts Bank. He was unable to acquire the partnership in the Bank (it passed to his elder brother Edward) but he inherited a substantial fortune from his father, a partner in Coutts & Co Bank from 1796 until his death on 17 September 1868, aged 92. As to his parentage there was some controversy. Although the Lyon Office of Scotland registered his family pedigree, he was accused of being a charlatan. The disproofs were offered as a statement of contradiction concerning his descent.Foster, R. F, \\"Collectanea Generalis\\", part 8, pp. 61-72 Burnett of the Lyon's Herald wrote an article in The Genealogist upholding the Lyon Office's original assertion of genuine authenticity.The Genealogist magazine, vol. 6, pp. 294-303 Dudley Coutts, as his banking second name implies, acquired considerable family wealth of his own after the purchase of Meux Brewery. He grew rich as a partner of Meux & Co's brewery, and later a director of the East India Company. With some of this wealth he built the mansion of Brook House in London's fashionable Park Lane and, by 1846, had purchased the highland deer forest of Guisachan in Glen Affric, Inverness-shire, and the substantial estates of Hutton and Eddington near his family roots in Berwickshire. Marjoribanks had large kennels at Guisachan and was largely responsible for developing the then new breed of dog, known now as the golden retriever.Golden Retrievers: HistoryLord Tweedmouth Memorial He married Isabella Hogg, daughter of Sir James Hogg, Bt, in 1848.

He was born to parents of Scottish and German heritage. He immigrated to Canada with his family at the age of six. They first moved to Edmonton, Alberta but after only a year relocated to Oakville, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto. His exposure to bands such as the Dead Kennedys, Black Flag and Bad Brains inspired him to pick up the bass guitar at the age of fifteen. He quickly took to the instrument and within a few months had joined a Toronto punk band called Intensive Chaos. Primarily self-taught, Gordon continued to play in a string of basement bands and soon graduated to the independent scene where he started playing local gigs with Jonathan Cummins (Bionic, Doughboys), and Cam and Brad Maclean in Circus Lupus. After finishing high school, Gordon enrolled in the jazz program at Humber College to further his musical knowledge. Around the same time the demise of Circus Lupus led him to join the newly formed Rocktopus. Rocktopus released several independent cassettes and an EP on Lone Wolf Records. The band toured regularly across Ontario and Quebec and successfully completed two cross Canada and one North American tour before finally calling it quits. In 1993, only one month after Rocktopus split, Gordon joined I Mother Earth, who had already signed a worldwide deal with Capitol records. A few short weeks after he joined the band, they embarked on a pre-album release tour across the United States. Gordon was credited with bass duty on 1993's Dig, though he did not actually record it. However, he did record on 1996's Scenery and Fish, 1999's Blue Green Orange, and 2003's The Quicksilver Meat Dream. In 2003, the band parted ways to pursue different projects. Gordon expanded his teaching practice, both privately and at the Twelfth Fret, and began to explore new musical endeavors. He tried his hand at as many different musical styles as possible, including various jazz and blues artists, and for a year worked with songwriter Alison Maclean in her band Fourstar. He also performed with the funk improv band Hot Fo' Gandhi and the lo-fi jazz combo the Tiny Specks. In early 2005, Gordon was hired by Blue Man Group to help open up a new Toronto- based show. He continues to perform with the eclectic ensemble on a variety of instruments that include electric zither, chapman stick and talking drum. Gordon joined with fellow Blue Man musicians Dave Steele and Steve Ballstadt to form the instrumental spy-go-go-surf-noir trio Experiment In Terror. His newest project is the live electro groove collective called Ostrich. Gordon now lives in Florida, where he continues to work for Blue Man Group. In 2012, he reunited with the rest of the most recent I Mother Earth lineup for several live performances across Canada.http://imotherearth.ca/openmouth/?p=6 They have also recorded a new song.
