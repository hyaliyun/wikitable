The Bowman C4I system consists of a range of HF radio, VHF radio and UHF radio sets designed to provide secure integrated voice, data services to dismounted soldiers, individual vehicles and command HQs up to Division level. Bowman has a number of specific applications installed on the base radio infrastructure known as BISAs. Bowman has been released incrementally as a number of phased capability releases, known as BCIP releases, with BCIP 5.5 being released in the field in 2013.MoD DESider Magazine article \\"Latest Bowman gets set for front line delivery\\" Bowman replaced the Clansman series of radios. As of 2016, the MoD publicised plans to replace Bowman with a system named Morpheus. Procurement history The concept of Bowman dates from a 1989 UK MoD General Staff Requirement (GSR) for a system to replace the ageing Clansman radio system. The GSR was subsequently modified to accommodate post Cold War scenarios. The procurement had a long and chequered history, with a number of consortia involved in the development and bidding process. This process culminated in the failure in 2000 of the preferred bidder, Archer, to deliver the requirement within budget and on time, and the resultant cessation of the contract by the UK MoD. The subsequent rebidding process for the contract was won by CDC Systems UK Ltd, once a subsidiary of Computing Devices Canada (CDC), now General Dynamics United Kingdom Ltd as prime contractor. The resultant system was based on some aspects of CDC's Iris Digital Communications System, created for the Canadian Army, with elements of design and manufacturing sub-contracted to: Cogent Defence Systems (now Airbus Defence and Space); SELEX Communications (than Selex ES, in turn merged in Leonardo S.p.A., previously Finmeccanica since 2016); ITT Exelis (now Harris Corporation); Harris Corporation; L-3 Communications; Blazepoint; DRS Tactical Systems; BAE Systems; GDC4S; and Thales Group. AgustaWestland was responsible for training installations and classrooms for the conversion training. The procurement cost of the supply and (initial) support phase for Bowman was approximately £1.9 billion and the current acquisition cost of the whole project is £2.4 billion. Bowman’s initial operating capability was delivered into service in March 2004, it was fully rolled out across the Armed Forces by the end of 2008 and is expected to continue in service until approximately 2026. System overview Bowman provides a tactical voice and data communications system for joint operations across the British Armed Forces in support of land and amphibious operations. It is fitted to over 15,000 military vehicles, from Land Rover Wolf to the Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank. The entire Royal Navy fleet is fitted with Bowman equipment as are all the major helicopter types supporting land operations, such as Apache, Chinook, Merlin and Lynx. Bowman features enhanced communications security (COMSEC) through integrated voice and data encryption devices and enhanced electronic protective measures through features such as frequency-hopping spread spectrum. It also provides tactical situational awareness for commanders through GPS links, helping to reduce the probability of friendly fire. The cryptographic core is based on a Pritchel II High Grade algorithm designed by CESG.Secure Data Transceiver (SDT) 500 isa fully accredited device using the Pritchel II chipset developed for the Bowman programme. The complete contract involves more than 48,000 radios (excluding the 45,000 Personal Role Radios) and more than 30,000 computer terminals being installed in more than 30,000 platforms, together with the necessary training of around 75,000 Service personnel. The Bowman system is a fundamental part of the British Military, achieving a Network Enabled Capability, providing the carriers for the passage of data between the various software applications involved. It is related to the Future Integrated Soldier Technology concept. The procurement and support of Bowman is led by the Battlefield And Tactical Communications and Information Systems (BATCIS) delivery team, for many years within Defence Equipment and Support, now part of Information Systems & Services at MoD Abbey Wood. Equipment H4855 Personal Role Radio Nominally the lowest deployed part of the Bowman series of radios is that provided by Leonardo-Finmeccanica (previously Selex ES), in the form of the UHF H4855 Personal Role Radio (PRR), which is primarily used by infantry fireteam (section level and below). PRR is only partially connected with the Bowman programme, as it was hived off from the acquisition process in October 1999 for more rapid implementation, and the first of 45,000 units formally entered service in early 2002. Operating in the 2.4 GHz band, PRR had no integrated encryption devices and does not intercommunicate with the rest of the Bowman network, but is widely acclaimed as having revolutionised intra-squad communications and small-unit tactics. Models are designated \\"UK/PRC\\", which stands for \\"United Kingdom / Portable Radio Communications\\", or \\"UK/VRC\\", which is \\"United Kingdom / Vehicle Radio Communications\\". Following this logic \\"UK/ARC\\" stands for \\"United Kingdom / Airborne Radio Communications\\". =VHF radios= *VPT - a UK Type 1 (Pritchel) encrypted section to platoon-level UK/PRC354 5W VHF Portable Transceiver (VPT) *ADR+ - an enhanced and improved 'Bowmanised' version of ITT Corporation's company/squadron-level SINCGARS (Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System) frequency-hopping radio with a 30-88 MHz frequency range. Depending on its configuration, the ADR+ is variously designated UK/PRC355 (5 W manpack), UK/PRC356 (16 W ground-role manpack), UK/VRC357 (16 W vehicle clip-in radio), UK/VRC358 (16 W low-power vehicle radio), or UK/VRC359 (50 W vehicle-mounted high-power radio). The manpack version of the ADR+ has an Automatic Situational Awareness Module inserted in BCIP 5.2 which enables Own Station Position Reports to be broadcast without the presence of an associated computer. Under the terms of the baseline contract, ITT Defence delivered some 26,000 ADR+ radios and 8,000 VPTs, complemented by 580 examples of the UK/ARC341 VHF aircraft role radio (a derivative of the company's SINCGARS AN/ARC-201D airborne transceiver) for helicopter platforms. =HF radios= The HF PRC 325 is based on the Harris RF-5800H model The Bowman HF frequency- hopping radios, of which 10,800 examples were supplied is designated UK/PRC325 in its basic 20 W manpack form and UK/VRC328/9 in its 100 W high-power and co- sited vehicular configurations. Essentially a UK equivalent of the US AN/PRC-150, it has had the proprietary Harris Citadel encryption from the original RF-5800H replaced with UK Type 1 (Pritchel) encryption and frequency hopping waveform. The Falcon II's original dual-band HF/VHF frequency range (1.6-60 MHz) has been narrowed to the 1.6-30 MHz (HF) band. =HCDR= The top tier in the Bowman series of radios is provided by the UHF, Mobile ad hoc network ITT UK/VRC340 HCDR (High Capacity Data Radio), a 'Bowmanised' version of ITT's Mercury NTDR (Near-Term Data Radio) wide-band networking transceiver. HCDR has a 225-450 MHz operating frequency range. It has wideband (4 MHz) and narrow band (500 kHz) modem configurations, with a user rate of 288 kbit/s on a 375 kbit/s channel and 576 kbit/s on a 750 kbit/s channel. Some 3,600 HCDRs were purchased. HCDR provides a self-managing mobile Internet Backbone using standard RFC interfaces and routing protocols. =Ancillary equipment= Provision of the associated User Data Terminal (UDT) for vehicular and static use was contracted to DRS Tactical Systems Inc, which also produces the Bowman Management Data Terminal (BMDT) for network management, the Vehicle User Data Terminal (VUDT) with keyboard and touchscreen for use on the move, the Staff User Data Terminal (SUDT) for command centres, and the PBISA Processing Unit (PBPU) for Challenger 2 tanks. Since the start of the programme, the capabilities of the UDTs (based on 700 MHz Pentium processors) have evolved, their original 256 MB RAMs and 20 GB drives having been superseded by 512 MB RAMs and 40 GB drives. The contractor for supply of Portable User Data Terminal (PUDTs), based on a 266 MHz Intel StrongARM processor, was L-3 Communications. The PUDT is now obsolete and is not used. Extensive problems with the software running on low powered computers led to the procurement of a number of enhanced computers, the Lightweight Tablet (LTDT) manufactured by Blazepoint and Lightweight Manpack (LMDT) produced by L-3. In addition to processing limitations, the larger UDTs have significant ergonomic issues and were supplemented with a buy of General Dynamics Itronix computers modified in the UK by Blazepoint to support systems managers and communication planners. Responsibility for the supply of Bowman audio ancillaries, including the stereo staff-user headset, noise-cancelling general-purpose handset, and loudspeaker unit, was vested in Selex ES, which also provided the lightweight headset, respirator adapter, and remote pressel switch associated with the PRR. Racal (now Thales Group) provided antennas for the Bowman contract. These include HF Wire/Vehicle, VHF Vehicle/Elevated, VHF Ground Spike, 5.4 metre GRP Mast and UHF Vehicle/Elevated Antennas. Additional antennas supplied as part of the Bowman contract are the man-pack antennas, which are supplied together with the matching unit by MGS Precision, based in Stone, Staffordshire. =BISAs= Bowman also consists of a number of specifically designed Battlefield Information System Applications running over the Bowman infrastructure. The UDTs (User Data Terminals) are currently limited to supporting a maximum of two BISAs simultaneously, due to the performance limitations of the UDTs. ComBAT, produced by GDC4S in the US, the main Command and Control (C2) tool for Bowman has faced early criticism relating to performance, ease of use and interface design. A significant portion of these problems have been addressed in later version of ComBAT. BISAs include - ComBAT (C2 & SA), GBAD (Ground Based Air Defence) Command & Control, Makefast (Engineering) and FC (Fire Control). Controversy When Bowman was first introduced into service, the system was said to contain many faults to the extent that troops dubbed Bowman \\"Better Off With Map And Nokia\\". The programme came under scrutiny following a National Audit Office accountability hearing for the government's procurement policy and was generally considered to be a success considering the complexity and changing needs of the UK Armed Forces. A 2007 report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee was overwhelmingly critical of the entire system and its procurement.Public Accounts Committee report The report itself was split into four sections entitled: \\"programme governance arrangements were not fit for purpose\\", \\"initial decisions were not well informed\\", \\"through life costs were not rigorously assessed\\", and \\"operational benefits are limited\\". As Bowman was being phased into service, senior officers in the British Army had serious reservations about the system, especially as many of their initial design specifications and feedback had not been adequately incorporated by the Defence Procurement Agency in the re-tendering process that was won by General Dynamics United Kingdom. Such were the misgivings, that the Director of Infantry initially refused to accept the portable \\"manpack\\" radio into service, saying: Other complaints were brought up by the 1st Bn Royal Anglians, who tested the UK/PRC354 radio system in July 2005. A number of problems have been reported, including RF burns received while transmitting data on some settings, comparatively heavy compared to equivalent Clansman radio sets, unergonomic wiring and user interfaces on the manpack radio, short-lived batteries, inadequate \\"ruggedisation\\" and inflexibility with assigning unique call sign indicators to individuals which are now instead permanently programmed into the radios themselves instead of the Clansman BATCO assigned system, which would change every 12 hours and could be used on any number of different radio sets by the operator as required. This has led to seven modifications to the radio since the operational field trial in December 2004. However, there have been other, more recent reports of the radios continuing to suffer from the already mentioned design flaws, as well as operational failures and faults, including whilst in the midst of combat engagements, consequently hampering the combat effectiveness with soldiers deployed on both Operation Herrick in Afghanistan and Operation TELIC in Iraq,House of Commons - Defence - Written Evidence leading to accusations that the system was not ready for operational use and in some cases the releases were unsuitable for their intended purpose, including the role as part of the Future Integrated Soldier Technology concept. In December 2008 and January 2009, Bowman was withdrawn from the Territorial Army (apart from the Honourable Artillery Company, 43 (Wessex) Signal Squadron (V) - a TA squadron forming part of 21 Signal Regiment, 2 (NC) Signal Brigade and the Yeomanry) as the manufacturers struggled to meet the demand created by operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Future replacement As of 2016, the MoD publicised plans to replace Bowman with a system named Morpheus. Morpheus \\"will deliver the next generation of Tactical Communication and Information Systems (TacCIS) capability. It will address critical system obsolescence and introduce a more agile TacCIS solution (both technical and business).\\"  References  External links  *Army website overview of Bowman as at November 2014 *The Bowman system as described on MoD website c 2006 *The Register: MPs: UK defence project was crap *Daily Telegraph: £1.9 bn portable radio system gets a poor reception from Army *Bowman is to be upgraded to BCIP 5 Category:British military radio Category:United Kingdom defence procurement Category:General Dynamics ","title":"Bowman (communications system)"},{"id":"2493892","text":"Glenn J.

Hillcrest School was ranked 40th out of the top 100 best high schools in Africa by Africa Almanac in 2003, based upon quality of education, student engagement, strength and activities of alumni, school profile, internet and news visibility. History In 1942, Hillcrest School was founded to provide a Christian education for missionary children by the Church of the Brethren Mission. Anticipation was keen. Clarence and Lucile Heckman had been remodeling and getting ready the storeroom and house on the CBM compound for this hoped for day of July 22, 1942. The teacher, Mary Dadisman, welcomed 12 pupils to begin Hillcrest School, a new venture of the Church of the Brethren Mission. The school room, which also served as a house, had few pupils, with only two who were missionary children of CBM. Miss Dadisman, both a nurse and teacher had left the Garkida hospital to be the first teacher of the school. In its first location, the school supplied a bed, food, foster parents, a teacher, but no text books. The order had been placed early, but the books were lost at sea because of the war. A second order was placed. When it didn't arrive, a tracer brought a report: ship sunk. Then in May, 1943 80 different packages arrived. School was dismissed and all the children went with the staff to the post office to bring the first text books to Hillcrest. Books had never been more welcomed by either pupils or teachers. In 1946, the school moved to the current location. In 1952 Hillcrest had been in operation for 10 years. The enrollment was above 70. A special recognition service was held at St. Piran's church and 8th grade certificates were presented there to the 6 graduates. From the beginning, Hillcrest accepted pupils without regard to race or colour. On March 29, 1947, \\"The Nigerian Daily Times\\", Lagos, carried an article \\"No colour Bar in Brethren Mission School.\\" Other missions quickly developed an interest in Hillcrest. So, in 1955 the Sudan United Mission, Assemblies of God Mission and the United Missionary Society joined CBM's efforts. These original four grew to include the Missouri Synod Lutheran Mission (1963), the American Lutheran Mission (1964), the Nigerian Baptist Mission (1967), Mambilla Baptist Mission (1967), Sudan Interior Mission (1968), the Great Commission Movement (1982), United Methodist and the Wycliffe Bible Translators. By November 1955 all arrangements for capital contributions and organization had been worked out and the first meeting of the Board of Governors of Hillcrest School met. A constitution had been written, home boards had been contracted over and over and when the Board met for the first meeting there were present people from the 4 cooperating branches of S.U.M., Assemblies of God, U.M.S. and C.B.M. Cooperating missions share in capital investments and furnish staff members. In 1972, Hillcrest became a day school and many of the cooperating bodies opened their own hostels. Currently, there are five approved hostels: Pineview (DL), Niger Creek (SIM), Crescent Hill (IMB), Mountain View (CRC) and DivineView (non- mission). Hillcrest began as a primary school, and secondary school classes were taken by correspondence until 1964. 1965 saw the first graduating class made up of eight students. School Facts Hillcrest School is a cooperative mission school run by 10 cooperating mission agencies, and each is responsible to supply teachers. Since its beginning in 1942, it has educated not only missionary kids but children from all over the world. Currently, there are 235 students in grades 1-12, representing twenty four countries and ten major languages. Hillcrest has been open to Nigerian students and expatriates who meet the entrance requirements established by the Board of Governors of the school. Most of the students of the school live in Jos, but there are many children who board while their parents are doing mission work in other places in Nigeria and West Africa. Four of the hostels that students board in are; Divine View Hostel and Pine View Hostel. The faculty at Hillcrest is made up of experienced, certified teachers. Twelve of the thirty teachers on staff hold advanced degrees beyond a Bachelor of Arts and Science. The school is on about , and breaks into three schools, Elementary (grades 1-5), Middle (grades 6-8), and High School. The school uses an American curriculum and is designed to academically equip students to successfully fit into American and European Colleges and Universities. The school offers a wide range of courses which includes Bible (4 courses), English (8), Industrial Arts (4), Mathematics (10), Music (3), Physical Education (5), Science (5), Social Studies (5), Arts (6), Computer (4), Business (2), among other subjects and courses including AP courses.

A course is usually an individual subject. Courses generally have a fixed program of sessions every week during the term, called lessons or classes. Students may receive a grade and academic credit after completion of the course.\\"course\\" in Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. Retrieved 15 August 2008. In India, the United Kingdom, Australia and Singapore, as well as parts of Canada, a course is the entire programme of studies required to complete a university degree, and the word \\"unit\\" or \\"module\\" would be used to refer to an academic course as used in North America and the rest of Europe. This corresponds roughly to an academic major in the United States system. In South Africa, a course is officially the collection of all courses (in the American sense, these are often called \\"modules\\") over a year or semester, though the American usage is common. In the Philippines, a course can be an individual subject (usually referred to by faculty and school officials) or the entire programme (usually referred to by students and outsiders). Courses are time- limited in most universities worldwide, lasting anywhere between several weeks to several semesters. They can either be compulsory material or \\"elective\\". An elective is usually not a required course, but there are a certain number of non-specific electives that are required for certain majors. Types of courses Courses are made up of individual sessions, typically on a fixed weekly schedule. There are different formats of course in universities: *the lecture course, where the instructor gives lectures with minimal interaction; *the seminar, where students prepare and present their original written work for discussion and critique; *the colloquium or reading course, where the instructor assigns readings for each session which are then discussed by the members; *the tutorial course, where one or a small number of students work on a topic and meet with the instructor weekly for discussion and guidance. *the Directed Individual Study course, where a student requests to create and title an area of study for themselves which is more concentrated and in-depth than a standard course. It is directed under a tenured faculty member and approved by a department chair or possibly the dean within that specific college; *the laboratory course, where most work takes place in a laboratory. Many courses combine these formats. Lecture courses often include weekly discussion sections with smaller groups of students led by the principal instructor, another instructor, or teaching assistant. Laboratory courses often combine lectures, discussion sections, and laboratory sessions. Students are expected to do various kinds of work for a course: *Attending course sessions. *Reading and studying course readings assigned in the course syllabus. *Discussing material they have read. *Writing short and long papers based on assigned reading and their own library research. *Completing homework or problem sets. *Completing laboratory exercises. *Taking quizzes and examinations. The exact work required depends on the discipline, the course, and the particular instructor. Unlike most European university courses, grades are generally determined by all of these kinds of work, not only the final examination. Elective and required courses An elective course is one chosen by a student from a number of optional subjects or courses in a curriculum, as opposed to a required course which the student must take. While required courses (sometimes called \\"core courses\\" or \\"general education courses\\") are deemed essential for an academic degree, elective courses tend to be more specialized. Elective courses usually have fewer students than the required courses. The term elective is also used for a period of medical study conducted away from the student's home medical school, often abroad. Motivations for choosing such a program include a wish to experience other cultures and to learn how to work in the clinical situations in other countries.A guide for electives Typically, North American universities require students to achieve both breadth of knowledge across disciplines and depth of knowledge in a particular chosen subject area, known as a major. Thus, students of the Arts or Humanities are required to take some science courses, and vice versa. Normally, students are free to choose their particular electives from among a wide range of courses offered by their university, as long as the students possess the prerequisite knowledge to understand the subject matter being taught. An English major, for example, might also study one or two years of chemistry, biology or physics as well as mathematics and a foreign language. Elective courses are also offered in the third and fourth years of university, though the choice is more restrictive and will depend upon the particular major the student has chosen. For example, at the University of British Columbia, students intending to specialize in Sanskrit as part of a major in Asian language and culture will usually have to complete several Sanskrit and Hindustani or Punjabi courses during the first two years of university, as well as additional courses in other languages of India in the third and fourth years of study. In addition to these required courses, however, students would choose among several third- and fourth-year elective courses on topics not directly related to India, such as the history and culture of China, Japan or Indonesia.Major in Asian Language and Culture, UBC Calendar 2009/10. Retrieved 2009-12-07. Course numbering system In the United States, most universities implement a course numbering system where each course is identified by the name of the major (or an abbreviation thereof) followed by a 3- or 4-digit number − for example, CS 123. This common numbering system was designed to make transfer between colleges easier. In theory, any numbered course in one academic institution should bring a student to the same standard as a similarly numbered course at other institutions.. The first digit of the course number is related to its level, or relative difficulty, of the course, and can roughly correspond the year of study in which the course is likely to be taken. It is common for the second digit to represent the subfield in the department within which the course is offered − for example, in a Physics department, all courses numbered PHYS 47xx may be about magnetism, while all PHYS 48xx courses may be about optics. The attribution of the third and fourth digits is less standardized, but in general, sequences of related courses tend to have consecutive course numbers, with gaps between such sequences to signal different sets of courses. The course number 101 is often used for an introductory course at a beginner's level in a department's subject area.

Note the highly distinctive venomous dorsal spines (separated by almost-black coloured skin) and dark-tipped tail. Weevers (or weeverfish) are nine extant species of fishes of family Trachinidae, order Trachiniformes, part of the Percomorpha clade. They are long (up to 37 cm), mainly brown in color, and have venomous spines on their first dorsal fin and gills. During the day, weevers bury themselves in sand, just showing their eyes, and snatch prey as it comes past, which consists of shrimp and small fish. Weevers are unusual in not having swim bladders, as do most bony fish, and as a result, sink as soon as they stop actively swimming. With the exception of T. cornutus from the southeast Pacific, all species in this family are restricted to the eastern Atlantic (including the Mediterranean). A tenth, extinct species, Callipterus speciosus, is known from the Monte Bolca lagerstätte of the Lutetian epoch. Weevers are sometimes used as an ingredient in the recipe for bouillabaisse.Jean-Louis André, Cuisines des pays de France, Éditions du Chêne, 2001 Weevers are sometimes erroneously called 'weaver fish', although the word is unrelated. In fact, the word 'weever' is believed to derive from the Old French word wivre, meaning serpent or dragon, from the Latin vipera. It is sometimes also known as the viperfish, although it is not related to the viperfish proper (i.e., the stomiids of the genus Chauliodus). In Australia, sand perches of the family Mugilidae are also known as weevers.

Interaction with humansCauses, frequency, and prevention= Most human stings are inflicted by the lesser weever, which habitually remains buried in sandy areas of shallow water and is thus more likely to come into contact with bathers than other species (such as the greater weever, which prefers deeper water); stings from other species are generally limited to anglers and commercial fishermen. Even very shallow water (sometimes little more than damp sand) may harbour lesser weevers. The vast majority of injuries occur to the foot and are the result of stepping on buried fish; other common sites of injury are the hands and buttocks. Stings are most common in the hours before and after low tide (especially at springs), so one possible precaution is to avoid bathing or paddling at these times. Weever stings have been known to penetrate wet suit boots even through a rubber sole (if thin), and bathers and surfers should wear sandals, \\"jelly shoes\\", or wetsuit boots with relatively hard soles, and avoid sitting or \\"rolling\\" in the shallows. Stings also increase in frequency during the summer (to a maximum in August), but this is probably the result of the greater number of bathers. The lesser weever can be found from the southern North Sea to the Mediterranean, and is common around the south coast of the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Atlantic coast of France, Portugal and Spain, and the northern coast of the Mediterranean. The high number of bathers found on popular tourist beaches in these areas means stings are common, although individual chances of being stung are low. The South Wales Evening Post stated (on 8 August 2000) that around 40 weever stings are recorded in the Swansea and Gower area every year, but many victims do not seek medical assistance and go uncounted. =Symptoms= At first, many victims believe they have simply scratched themselves on a sharp stone or shell, although this barely hurts; significant pain begins about 2–3 minutes after being stung. Weever stings cause severe pain; common descriptions from victims are \\"extremely painful\\" and \\"much worse than a wasp (or bee) sting\\". Common and minor symptoms include severe pain, itching, swelling, heat, redness, numbness, tingling, nausea, vomiting, joint aches, headaches, abdominal cramps, lightheadedness, increased urination, and tremors. Rare and severe symptoms include abnormal heart rhythms, weakness, shortness of breath, seizures, decreased blood pressure, gangrene, tissue degeneration,Branko Šuljić, Sportski ribolov, 2001 and unconsciousness. =Treatment= Although extremely unpleasant, weever stings are not generally dangerous and the pain will ease considerably within a few hours even if untreated. Complete recovery may take a week or more; in a few cases, victims have reported swelling and/or stiffness persisting for months after envenomation. First aid treatment consists of immersing the affected area in hot water (as hot as the victim can tolerate without being scalded), which will accelerate denaturation of the protein-based venom. The use of hot water will reduce the pain felt by the victim after a few minutes. Usual experience is that the pain then fades within 10 to 20 minutes, as the water cools. Folklore often suggests the addition of substances to the hot water, including urine, vinegar, and Epsom salts, but this is of limited (if any) value. Heat should be applied for at least 15 minutes, but the longer the delay (before heat is applied), the longer the treatment should be continued. Once the pain has eased, the injury should be checked for the remains of broken spines, and any found need to be removed. Over-the-counter analgesics, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, may be of assistance in management of pain and can also reduce edema. Medical advice should be sought if any of the symptoms listed above as rare or severe are observed, if swelling spreads beyond the immediate area of injury (e.g. from hand to arm), if symptoms persist, or if any other factor causes concern. Medical treatment consists of symptom management, analgesia (often with opiates) and the same heat treatment as for first aid - more systemic treatment using histamine antagonists may assist in reducing local inflammation.Journal of Accident and Emergency Medicine 1996;13:141-142 =Fatalities= The only recorded death in the UK occurred in 1933, when a fisherman off Dungeness suffered multiple stings. The victim may have died of other medical causes exacerbated by the stings. Jonathan Wickings died after being stung by an unknown sea creature off the coast of Majorca in 1998. This was reported as a possible weever sting, although he was not in contact with the sea bed and some witnesses reported seeing a snake in the water.

It is situated on the west side of the city near the Dâmbovița River, where it flows into Lacul Morii. Its name means \\"people living in a young forest\\". Nearby neighborhoods include Giulești. History Coins from the 4th century during the reign of Valentinian I and a furnace for making clay pots were discovered in the area. A map in 1835 displays a small village with only five houses called Crângași between Bucharest, Dâmbovița River and Marele Voievod commune. In 1922 a part of the village was integrated in Bucharest. Between 1940 and 1960 the area was inhabited by poor people which built houses near the river. In the early 60s, communist style apartment blocks were built in the area, initially known as the Constructorilor housing estate. It later continued in the mid to late 1980s with 8 to 10 storey apartment blocks. Due to the rise of the Dâmboviţa River the area was frequently flooded. The problem was solved in 1986 when Lacul Morii was built. http://ghid.imopedia.ro/dex/crangasi-247.html  Commercial areas  Piața Crângași is a flea market in the center of the neighborhood which sells anything from fruits and cereals to shoes and electronics. In 2005 the Grant Shopping Center was opened on Virtuții street, near the Crângași metro station. The shopping complex hosts 50 stores, a beauty saloon and a coffee shop.  Recreation  The main attraction of the area is Lacul Morii and the nearby park. During summer a swimming pool and a beach is opened in the south west part of the neighborhood. The Crângași Park has an outdoor stage where free plays are held during summer. There is also an artificial panel for climbing inside Grant Metal on Constructorilor boulevard.

Much of his work was in the Palladian style. In his day he was considered to be the leading architect in the north of England. Life He was born in Horbury, near Wakefield, England, the eldest of nine children and the son of a master mason, under whom he trained. He started an independent career in 1748 and continued until shortly before his death. John Carr was Lord Mayor of York in 1770 and 1785. Towards the end of his life Carr purchased an estate at Askham Richard, near York, to which he retired. On 22 February 1807 he died at Askham Hall. He was buried in St Peter and St Leonard's Church, Horbury, which he had designed and paid for. Career Carr decided to remain in Yorkshire rather than move to London because he calculated that there was ample patronage and the wealth to sustain it. No job was too small. His largest work, only partially finished, was the Hospital de Santo António in Oporto, Portugal. In order to maximise his income, he kept his staff to the minimum. His earliest assistant was William Lindley (architect 1739-1818),H Colvin Yale Univ Press, p.654 who from 1774 developed an independent practice. He was followed by the elder Peter Atkinson (1735-1805)H Colvin Yale Univ Press p.76 and possibly his son Peter the younger (1780-1843). Carr's nephew William Carr also assisted his uncle in his latter years. These architectural assistants had 'boys' to help them in turn. Carr rarely delegated matters that others would regard as too trivial, and in consequence Carr had to travel immense distances mostly on horse back.see correspondence Wentworth Woodhouse Muniments Sheffield Record Office However the frequency of such visits brought him into regular contact with his many clients to mutual advantage.Wentworth Woodhouse Muniments Sheffield Record Office Santo António Hospital, Oporto Carr’s own favourite work was the Crescent at Buxton in Derbyshire, an early example of multifunctional architecture. As well as hotels and lodging houses, it contained Assembly Rooms, shops, a post office and a public promenade all under one roof.see Carr's portrait (above) by Beechey where the building is illustrated On a smaller scale, the same is true of his Newark Town Hall.York Georgian Society. (1973). The works in architecture of John Carr:a list prepared by the York Georgian Society. Other public buildings included hospitals (e.g., Lincoln and York), racecourse grandstands (e.g. York, Doncaster and Nottingham), (all now demolished), and prisons at Wakefield and Northallerton. He designed new churches as well as repairing old ones. The former were all privately financed, the latter were financed by the existing parishes. His single span roof construction allowed him to build the new churches without the traditional subdivision into nave and aisles.see plans in Wakefield County Record Office He served as bridgemaster for both the North and West Ridings of Yorkshire, leaving a legacy of countless bridges the majority of which still stand today.The Industrial Architecture of Yorkshire by Jane Hatcher, p. 69, The more than 60 bridges built or altered by Carr still serve the backbone of North Yorkshire's road transport network. Carr was Lord Mayor of York in 1770 and 1785. His commissions for country houses included model villages and farms, stable blocks, a variety of gate lodges and gateways, garden temples and other ornamental buildings. Notable among them his works for the estates of Harewood and Wentworth Woodhouse.The relevant drawings are in the record offices of Leeds and Sheffield. He took particular care with their planning and construction to maximise value for money for both the immediate patron and for the buildings' future long-term maintenance. He used traditional materials and methods of construction where these had proved sound, but adopted new methods and materials where these could be shown to have an advantage. His training as a stonemason naturally led him to build in that material. In particular he enjoyed using 'great' stones as at Tabley House. He liked well proportioned rooms which were satisfactory living spaces with or without decorative enrichment. In his view the latter could be provided later if money permitted. As a result, most of his buildings were completed and because of the soundness of construction most survive. Among the buildings accessible in whole or part to the public today are Buxton Crescent, Newark Town Hall, virtually all his bridges, Harewood House, Tabley House, Clifton House (a museum in Rotherham), Lytham Hall and Fairfax House at 27 Castlegate York, now the headquarters of York Civic Trust. Influences During his long career there were several major changes in architectural style. His early work is a mixture of the Palladian and the Rococo. He then sought a purer Antique Roman style with occasional French influences before adapting the currently fashionable style associated with Robert Adam. At the end of his life he returned to the bolder Palladian style of his youth but with detail that looked forward to 19th-century usage. Carr's work was influenced by the books of Sebastiano Serlio and Andrea Palladio. He subscribed to many architectural pattern books, including those of his friend George Richardson, and also contemporary publications by Robert Morris and William Chambers.

Storey was born November 17, 1857, in San Francisco, California, the son of William Bainbridge Storey, an express, stagecoach and newspaper agent, and Ellen Dean (Benson) Storey. His family moved around following his father's career until 1866 when they settled in Colfax. in 1876, Storey started his railroad career with the Southern Pacific Railroad as a stake driver on the line between Oakland and Berkeley. He used his earnings from that summer and the following year to finance his college education, and he graduated from the University of California in 1881 with a mechanical engineering degree. He hired out with the Central Pacific Railroad and soon found himself working throughout Idaho, Utah and South Dakota as well as the California coast. Storey's association with the Santa Fe began when he was hired by the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railway (a Santa Fe subsidiary formed to make the railroad's connection to San Francisco) as chief engineer. He transferred to the Santa Fe in 1903 as chief engineer and worked his way up to the vice presidency of the Santa Fe in 1909. In 1917 he was appointed as the federal manager, and three years later, on January 1, 1920, he succeeded Edward Payson Ripley as president of the Santa Fe. He served as president until his retirement from the position on May 2, 1933. Storey remained on the board of directors until his death in 1940, a year after his successor's own death.

He eventually joined Republican Party and won election to the United States House of Representatives from Virginia's 9th congressional district and controlled federal patronage in the Commonwealth from 1903 to 1907. Slemp died unexpectedly at home while in office, after which his son C. Bascom Slemp succeeded to the seat for more than a decade, until ousted during the rise of the Byrd Organization. Early and family life Born near Turkey Cove in Lee County, Virginia, to Sebastian Smyth Slemp (1810-1859; whose grandfather had emigrated from Germany) and his wife, the former Margaret Reasor (1811-1871), both of families long prominent in the region, Campbell Slemp had an older brother, Henderson Clinton Slemp (1831-1901), and two elder sisters, Nervesta Overton Slemp Flanary (1834-1914) and Alpha Slemp Habern (1836-1893). He attended Emory and Henry College in Emory, Washington County, Virginia. He left when his father Sebastian Slemp died in 1859.Rose Slemp Quillen, \\"Col. Campbell Slemp\\" in Historical Sketches of Southwest Virginia, Southwest Virginia Historical Society Publication No. 6 (March 1970) p. 20 indicates probate of Sebastian Slemp's estate included the sale of ten slaves, mostly children, on November 24, 1859. His brother Henry C. Slemp, mother Margarett and sister Alpha Slemp owned several slaves in the 1860 U.S. federal census. Close inspection of those schedules and Virginia slave census schedules not available online may show Campbell Slemp did as well. Before the American Civil War, Campbell Slemp farmed and tended to real estate investments. Campbell Slemp married Nancy Brittain Cawood (nicknamed \\"Namie\\" 1840-1908) on July 25, 1861. Her ancestors had fought in the American Revolutionary War (Stephen Cawood of Washington County, Virginia was a drummer in Col. Byrd's regiment, and his son Berry Cawood served under George Rogers Clark in the expedition which captured Kaskaskia and Vincennes, and received a land grant because of that service).Sons of American Revolution Application for Campbell Bascom Slemp, dated March 1924, available online They would have three sons and three daughters: Emma M. Slemp (1865-1889), Henry C.M. Slemp (b./d. 1868), Susan Jane Slemp Newman (1869-1935), C. Bascom Slemp (1870-1943), William Moses Slemp (1873-1912) and Laura Alpha Drucilla Slemp (1877-1900).1880 U.S. Federal Census for Turkey Cove, Lee County, Virginiafindagrave no. 13440382 Military career During the Civil War, Slemp volunteered for the Confederate States Army and joined Company A of the 21st Virginia Infantry Battalion, becoming the laters commanding officer. By November 1862 the unit had been consolidated with another company into the 64th Virginia Mounted Infantry. Slemp rose in rank from captain to lieutenant colonel and finally colonel on December 14, 1862.Memorial p. 26 The unit defended the border between Virginia and both Tennessee and Kentucky, particularly the strategic Cumberland Gap and the strategic resources of lead mines and salt works at Saltville, Virginia. The Cumberland Gap was initially fortified by Confederate General Felix Zollicoffer (a former Tennessee Congressman), and contested by Unionist Tennessean Capt. Powhatan Carter. Although Zollicoffer was killed in action in the January 1862 during the first Kentucky invasion, Union Generals George H. Thomas and later William T. Sherman had difficulty securing the Cumberland Gap. At Pound Gap in nearby Wise County, Virginia, Slemp was among the Confederates opposed by Union Col. (later General and President) James Garfield, who forced their retreat. When Union Major General George Morgan was sent to secure the Cumberland Gap, Colonels William M. Churchwell and James E. Rains pleaded for reinforcements but their pleas were ignored; so they destroyed the supplies and evacuated. When the Union troops tried to secure the gap they likewise failed to receive reinforcements, so Confederate Generals Stevenson and Edmund Kirby Smith were able to retake it in September 1862 as Morgan evacuated into Kentucky. The next fall Union Gen. Ambrose Burnside was sent to take the gap and he delegated the job to an Irishman, John F. De Courcy. He got Confederate Gen. John W. Frazer drunk and believing that many Union troops were coming so in the nearly bloodless Battle of Cumberland Gap, Frazer surrendered his three regiments with 2300 men on September 9, 1863 to fewer than 500 Union soldiers. However, Col. Slemp and Maj. McDowell managed to escape with many men, and also evacuated about 400 Confederates from the Pinnacle nearby.Lorence T. Wagner, \\"Cumberland Gap During the Civil War\\" in Bicentennial History of Lee County Virginia 1792-1992, p. 31Memorial p. 15, speech by Mr. Gaines of West Virginia Col. Slemp was convicted of dereliction of duty on November 7, 1863, at a court martial in January 1864, was removed from command and dismissed from the army. The incident related to his moving captured wagons on that date, about two weeks after Union raiders had burned the 64th Virginia's camp near Jonesville. Although many Virginia legislators had urged that General \\"Grumble\\" Jones stop the proceedings (and Slemp's Lt.Col. Auburn L. Pridemore attempted to press charges against Gen. Jones for his actions on the same day), charges were pressed by Capt. H. Brown of the 8th Virginia Cavalry and Major Rhea of Tennessee. Col. Slemp hurt his own cause by slipping house arrest in Abington to return home.Jefrrey G. Weaver, 64th Virginia Infantry (Lynchburg, H.E. Howard, Inc. The Virginia Regimental Histories Series; 1992) pp. 1-5 Nonetheless, Slemp remained a loyal Confederate throughout the war, surrendering after General Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse. He received his parole at the Cumberland Gap in Tennessee on May 2, 1865, with others of the 64th Virginia. Political career After the war ended, Slemp received a pardon, and resumed farming. He became politically involved in the Readjuster Party, aligning with former Confederate General William Mahone who was consolidating railroads in Virginia and Tennessee.Speech of Rep.

Slemp had been elected to the Virginia Senate in 1875, and served one term in the part-time position. In 1879, Lee County voters elected Campbell Slemp to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he served (part-time) and was re- elected once. He unsuccessfully ran for the state senate in 1883. Although a Democrat up to that time, Slemp like Malone became a Virginia State Republican party leader. Slemp made an unsuccessful bid for Lieutenant Governor on Mahone's ticket in 1889, which lost badly. However, he was a Presidential elector for Harrison, and later President McKinley. In 1903 voters of Virginia's 9th congressional district (nicknamed the \\"Fighting Ninth\\" in part for its close elections and many party changes) elected Slemp to the United States House of Representatives. Slemp defeated 2-term Democrat William F. Rhea (a generation younger than the Major Rhea who had testified against him), who had defeated 2-term Republican James A. Walker (last commander of the Stonewall Brigade) in 1898. President Theodore Roosevelt, a fellow Republican, let Slemp control federal patronage in the Commonwealth,Memorial pp. 12, 22 Slemp won re-election twice (over J. C. Wysor in 1904 and then Robert P. Bruce in 1906). The Norfolk and Western Railway and textile mills expanded into his district. Death and legacy Slemp died unexpectedly at his home at Big Stone Gap in Wise County, Virginia on Sunday, October 13, 1907. Following his interment in the family cemetery in Lee County, Virginia, his son C. Bascom Slemp was selected to fill his Congressional seat, and won re-election several times until unseated (as the last Virginia Republican in Congress) during the rise of the Byrd Organization. The younger Slemp served as the United States Representative for the 9th District of Virginia from 1907 to 1922, and established the Slemp Foundation as well as the Southwest Virginia Museum.

A national parish is distinguished from the commonly known type of parish, the territorial parish, which serves a territory subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the territorial parish priest. A national parish is an ecclesiastic subdivision which serves a community of people but is not necessarily a geographic subdivision. Background National parishes housed in national churches in Rome have existed for centuries to meet the spiritual needs of people both temporarily or permanently residing in Rome and those visiting Rome on pilgrimage. For example, the Church of Santa Susanna served both as a titular church and the national parish for Americans until 2017, when it was replaced by San Patrizio a Villa Ludovisi. National parishes were first established in North America in the late 18th century, to meet the needs of immigrants not speaking the language of the majority population. The first national parish in North America was Holy Trinity German National Parish, founded in 1788 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Father Raymond A. Schroth, SJ, wrote in a 2002 National Catholic Reporter article about trusteeism that, \\"national parishes, particularly German and Polish, who brought over European traditions of the laypeople establishing and directing the parish,\\" have strongly represented the voice of the laity in the church. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, when covering Pope Benedict XVI's 2008 visit to the United States, identified two historically significant national parishes: Holy Trinity Church, in Philadelphia, established in 1789 as both the first national parish in the United States and the first to serve German-speaking Catholics; and, Saint Benedict the Moor's Church, in New York, established in 1883 as the first mission parish to serve African-American Catholics north of the Mason-Dixon line. As city populations changed, sometimes national parishes were merged into one church as population declines caused church closings. For instance, in Little Falls, New York, former national parishes for Italian, Polish and other immigrant groups have been closed. The Catholic community now worships in one church, renamed after the Holy Family. It is the largest physical church and had been founded as St. Patrick's by Irish Catholic immigrants, the first of waves of immigrants to this small city in the 19th and 20th centuries. In a 2009 National Catholic Reporter article about the resignation of Bishop Joseph Francis Martino of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Jerry Filteau noted the diocese's history of establishing national parishes for Polish people, Italians, Irish and other Catholic immigrant groups who arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He attributed failure by an earlier Irish- American bishop to be sensitive to the Polish national parish as being the catalyst for the separation of the Polish National Catholic Church in Scranton. George Gregory wrote in 2010 about the establishment of a new national parish designated for Hispanics in the Philadelphia archdiocese, noting that \\"national parishes serve particular ethnic communities, as opposed to territorial parishes, which serve a geographic area of an archdiocese or a diocese.\\" He said that the new parish was the 32nd national parish in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. The parish was established as St. Rocco Parish in Avondale, Pennsylvania, in southern Chester County, where a large number of Latinos have moved in recent years. Parish members are primarily Mexican, but some are Puerto Rican, Colombian, Argentinian, or have other Latin American backgrounds. As of 2010, the Philadelphia archdiocese had \\"13 Italian parishes, nine Polish parishes, three Slovak parishes, three Lithuanian parishes, two German parishes, and one Korean parish.\\" See also *National parishes (Québec) Notes and referencesNotesReferences=Further reading Category:Types of Roman Catholic organization Category:Church parishes ","title":"National parish"},{"id":"2494073","text":"An American Craftsman style home in Memphis' Central Gardens historic neighborhood Central Gardens is a historic Memphis neighborhood in Midtown.

History  Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Central Gardens was built primarily between 1850 and 1930 and originally served as home to the city's wealthy middle-class residents who moved east during the heyday of the cotton boom along with the expanding city limits, which by 1900 shifted to East Parkway in what is now Midtown.Viser, Barbara B.

Originally part of the estate of Solomon Rozelle, who had settled in Shelby County in 1815 on 1,600 acres of then wooded wilderness, the land that became Central Gardens was inherited by Rozelle's children upon his death in 1840, according to historian Barbara B. Viser.Viser, Barbara B. Central Gardens - stories of a neighborhood. Memphis, TN: Central Gardens Association, 1998, p. 4. Records from 1853 document that C. W. Rozelle owned 30 acres of what became Central Gardens. Also in 1853, Judge William Roland Harris bought 40 acres from B. L. Rozelle and built his home, Clanlo Hall, on what is now Central Avenue. Clanlo and the Rozelle House on Harbert Avenue, both c. 1853, were the only two homes in the neighborhood at the time. They are the oldest homes in Central Gardens. Unlike the nearby Annesdale neighborhood, which was created as a smaller, single subdivision, Central Gardens is made up of several subdivisions, such as Merriman Park, the Harbert Place subdivision, Bonnie Crest, as well as several large estates that were subdivided.

It reflects the prevailing tastes among early twentieth century middle class Memphians, and the best in urban residential community planning and architecture of that period. The wide variety of architectural styles works well because of uniform setbacks, cornice heights and massing, and the characteristic use of such details as front porches, bay window, porte- cochère, and leaded glass. The building materials include brick, limestone, stucco, clapboard, and wooden shingles, with many houses constructed of a mix of two or three of these. Workmanship is of a consistently high quality, and the detailing is extremely rich and well-conceived. With only a few exceptions, the architecture is more \\"mid-American\\" than \\"Southern\\"; according to architectural historian Vincent Scully, Central Gardens houses bear a closer resemblance to those in Oak Park, Illinois rather than to those in Natchez, Mississippi.\\"Neighborhood Map\\" published by The Central Gardens Neighborhood Association. The most prevalent architectural forms found in the district are the American foursquare and bungalow. Principal styles include Colonial Revival, American Craftsman, Eclectic, Mediterranean Revival, Mission, Neoclassical, Prairie School, Queen Anne, Tudor Revival, and Shingle style. While this architecture is fairly common, the superior quality of design, workmanship, materials and details is significantly uncommon. The mix of architectural styles contained in a typical district block achieves a very strong compositional harmony because virtually all houses adhere to the same rules of massing, scale, and cornice height setback and lot size. Since 1967, the architecture and the stories behind selected homes in the district have been shared publicly each September during the neighborhood association's annual Central Gardens Home and Garden Tour.Wilemon, Tom. \\"Architectural stories: home and garden tour chronicles Memphis styles,\\" The Daily News, September 8, 2010.

Hair care is an overall term for hygiene and cosmetology involving the hair which grows from the human scalp, and to a lesser extent facial, pubic and other body hair. Hair care routines differ according to an individual's culture and the physical characteristics of one's hair. Hair may be colored, trimmed, shaved, plucked or otherwise removed with treatments such as waxing, sugaring and threading. Hair care services are offered in salons, barbershops and day spas, and products are available commercially for home use. Laser hair removal and electrolysis are also available, though these are provided (in the US) by licensed professionals in medical offices or speciality spas. Hair cleaning and conditioningBiological processes and hygiene= Human hair close-up Care of the hair and care of the scalp skin may appear separate, but are actually intertwined because hair grows from beneath the skin. The living parts of hair (hair follicle, hair root, root sheath and sebaceous gland) are beneath the skin, while the actual hair shaft which emerges (the cuticle which covers the cortex and medulla) has no living processes. Damage or changes made to the visible hair shaft cannot be repaired by a biological process, though much can be done to manage hair and ensure that the cuticle remains intact. Scalp skin, just like any other skin on the body, must be kept healthy to ensure a healthy body and healthy hair production. If the scalp is cleaned regularly by those who have rough hair or have a hair-fall problem, it can result in loss of hair. However, not all scalp disorders are a result of bacterial infections. Some arise inexplicably, and often only the symptoms can be treated for management of the condition (example: dandruff). There are also bacteria that can affect the hair itself. Head lice is probably the most common hair and scalp ailment worldwide. Head lice can be removed with great attention to detail, and studies show it is not necessarily associated with poor hygiene. More recent studies reveal that head lice actually thrive in clean hair. In this way, hair washing as a term may be a bit misleading, as what is necessary in healthy hair production and maintenance is often simply cleaning the surface of the scalp skin, the way the skin all over the body requires cleaning for good hygiene. The sebaceous glands in human skin produce sebum, which is composed primarily of fatty acids. Sebum acts to protect hair and skin, and can inhibit the growth of microorganisms on the skin. Sebum contributes to the skin's slightly acidic natural pH somewhere between 5 and 6.8 on the pH spectrum. This oily substance gives hair moisture and shine as it travels naturally down the hair shaft, and serves as a protective substance by preventing the hair from drying out or absorbing excessive amounts of external substances. Sebum is also distributed down the hair shaft \\"mechanically\\" by brushing and combing. When sebum is present in excess, the roots of the hair can appear oily, greasy, and darker than normal, and the hair may stick together. =Hair cleaning= One way to distribute the hair's natural oils through the hair is by brushing with a natural bristle brush. The natural bristles effectively move the oil from the scalp through to the hair's mid-lengths and ends, nourishing these parts of the hair. Brushing the scalp also stimulates the sebaceous gland, which in turn produces more sebum. When sebum and sweat combine on the scalp surface, they help to create the acid mantle, which is the skin's own protective layer. Washing hair removes excess sweat and oil, as well as unwanted products from the hair and scalp. Often hair is washed as part of a shower or bathing with shampoo, a specialized surfactant. Shampoos work by applying water and shampoo to the hair. The shampoo breaks the surface tension of the water, allowing the hair to become soaked. This is known as the wetting action. The wetting action is caused by the head of the shampoo molecule attracting the water to the hair shaft. Conversely, the tail of the shampoo molecule is attracted to the grease, dirt and oil on the hair shaft. The physical action of shampooing makes the grease and dirt become an emulsion that is then rinsed away with the water. This is known as the emulsifying action. Sulfate free shampoos are less harming on color treated hair than normal shampoos that contain sulfates. Sulfates strip away natural oils as well as hair dye. Sulfates are also responsible for the foaming effect of shampoos. Shampoos have a pH of between 4 & 6\\\\. Acidic shampoos are the most common type used and maintain or improve the condition of the hair as they don't swell the hairshaft and don't strip the natural oils. Conditioners are often used after shampooing to smooth down the cuticle layer of the hair, which can become roughened during the physical process of shampooing. There are three main types of conditioners: anti-oxidant conditioners, which are mainly used in salons after chemical services and prevent creeping oxidation; internal conditioners, which enter into the cortex of the hair and help improve the hair's internal condition (also known as treatments); and external conditioners, or everyday conditioners, which smooth down the cuticle layer, making the hair shiny, combable and smooth. Conditioners can also provide a physical layer of protection for the hair against physical and environmental damage.

All of these are temporary alterations because permanent alterations are not possible at this time. Chemical alteration of hair only affects the hair above the scalp; unless the hair roots are damaged, new hair will grow in with natural color and texture. =Hair coloring= Hair coloring is the process of adding pigment to or removing pigment from the hair shaft. Hair coloring processes may be referred to as coloring or bleaching, depending on whether pigment is being added or removed. Temporary hair tints simply coat the shaft with pigments which later wash off. Most permanent color changes require that the cuticle of the hair be opened so the color change can take place within the cuticle. This process, which uses chemicals to alter the structure of the hair, can damage the cuticle or internal structure of the hair, leaving it dry, weak, or prone to breakage. After the hair processing, the cuticle may not fully close, which results in coarse hair or an accelerated loss of pigment. Generally, the lighter the chosen color from one's initial hair color, the more damaged it may be. Other options for applying color to hair besides chemical dyes include the use of such herbs as henna and indigo, or choosing ammonia-free solutions. =Perms and chemical straightening= Perms and relaxation using relaxer or thermal reconditioning involve chemical alteration of the internal structure of the hair in order to affect its curliness or straightness. Hair that has been subjected to the use of a permanent is weaker due to the application of chemicals, and should be treated gently and with greater care than hair that isn't chemically altered. Special considerations for hair typesLong hair= Many industries have requirements for hair being contained to prevent worker injury. This can include people working in construction, utilities, and machine shops of various sorts. Furthermore, many professions require containing the hair for reasons of public health, and a prime example is the food industry. There are also sports that may require similar constraints for safety reasons: to keep hair out of the eyes and blocking one's view, and to prevent being caught in sports equipment or trees and shrubs, or matted hair in severe weather conditions or water. Safety is usually the reason behind not allowing hair to fly loose on the backs of motorcycles and open-topped sports cars for longer tresses. =Delicate skin= Scalp skin of babies and the elderly are similar in subdued sebaceous gland production, due to hormonal levels. The sebaceous gland secretes sebum, a waxy ester, which maintains the acid mantle of the scalp and provides a coating that keeps skin supple and moist. The sebum builds overly, between every 2–3 days for the average adult. Those with delicate skin may experience a longer interval. Teenagers often require daily washing of the hair. Sebum also imparts a protective coating to hair strands. Daily washing will remove the sebum daily and incite an increase in sebum production, because the skin notices the scalp skin is lacking sufficient moisture. In cases of scalp disorders, however, this may not be the case. For babies and elderly, the sebaceous gland production is not at peak, thus daily washing is not typically needed. Treatment of damageSplit ends= Split ends, known formally as trichoptilosis, happen when the protective cuticle has been stripped away from the ends of hair fibers. This condition involves a longitudinal splitting of the hair fiber. Any chemical or physical trauma, such as heat, that weathers the hair may eventually lead to split ends. Typically, the damaged hair fiber splits into two or three strands and the split may be two to three centimeters in length. Split ends are most often observed in long hair but also occur in short hair that is not in good condition. As hair grows, the natural protective oils of the scalp can fail to reach the ends of the hair. The ends are considered old once they reach about 10 centimeters since they have had long exposure to the sun, gone through many shampoos and may have been overheated by hair dryers and hot irons. This all results in dry, brittle ends which are prone to splitting. Infrequent trims and lack of hydrating treatments can intensify this condition. =Breakage and other damage= Hair can be damaged by chemical exposure, prolonged or repeated heat exposure (as through the use of heat styling tools), and by perming and straightening. Oil is harmful for rough hair and for dry scalp as it decreases nourishment for hair leading to split and hair fall. When hair behaves in an unusual way, or a scalp skin disorder arises, it is often necessary to visit not only a qualified physician, but sometimes a dermatologist, or a trichologist. Conditions that require this type of professional help include, but are not limited to, forms of alopecia, hair pulling/picking, hair that sticks straight out, black dots on the hair, and rashes or burns resulting from chemical processes. Gel provides a shiny look but dries the hair and makes it rough. There are a number of disorders that are particular to the scalp. Symptoms may include: * Abnormal odor * Bleeding * Bumps * Caking skin buildup that appears white or another color than one's natural skin tone * Chafes * Clumps of hair falling out * Clumpy flakes that do not easily slough off the scalp skin * Dandruff and clumps * Dry hair & scalp * Excessive itchiness that doesn't go away with a few hair wash, redness of scalp skin * Patches of thinning * Pus-like drainage * Shedding Any of these symptoms may indicate a need for professional assistance from a dermatologist or trichologist for diagnosis. Scalp skin can suffer from infestations of mites, lice, infections of the follicles or fungus. There could be allergic reactions to ingredients in chemical preparations applied to the hair, even ingredients from shampoo or conditioners. Common concerns surrounding dandruff (often associated with excessive sebum); psoriasis, eczema, or seborrheic dermatitis. An odor that persists for a few weeks despite regular hair washing may be an indication of a health problem on the scalp skin. Not all flakes are dandruff. For example, some can merely be product buildup on the scalp skin. This could result from the common practice of applying conditioner to scalp skin without washing. This would dry upon the scalp skin and flake off, appearing like dandruff and even causing itchiness, but have no health effects whatsoever. There are various reasons for hair loss, most commonly hormonal issues. Fluctuations in hormones will often show in the hair. Not all hair loss is related to what is known as male pattern baldness, women can suffer from baldness just as men do. Formulas for addressing this specific cause of lack of hair growth yet typically they require around three months of consistent use for results to begin to appear. Cessation may also mean that gained growth may dissipate. Particularly among women, thyroid disease is one of the more under-diagnosed health concerns. Hair falling out in clumps is one symptom of a set of symptoms that may indicate a thyroid concern. In many gynecological exams a blood screen for thyroid is now a common protocol. Thyroid often shows up first in the behavior of the hair. During pregnancy and breast feeding, the normal and natural shedding process is typically suspended (starting around month three because it takes a while for the body to recognize and reset for the hormonal shifts the body goes through) for the period of gestation and extended longer if one breast feeds (this includes pumping for breast milk). Upon cessation of either of these, it typically takes around two months for the hormones to shift again to the normal hormonal settings, and hair shedding can increase exponentially, for approximately 3–6 months until hair returns to its normal volume. It is commonly noticed that hair seems thicker and shinier, even, during pregnancy and breast feeding in response to the influx of shifting hormones. It is not unusual also for hair color to change, or hair structure to change (e.g., straighter hair, curlier hair). These changes can occur more often than people may realize yet isn't often reported. =General hair loss= Some choose to shave their hair off entirely, while others may have an illness (such as a form of cancer—note that not every form of cancer or cancer treatment necessarily means one will lose their hair) that caused hair loss or led to a decision to shave the head. =Hair care and nutrition= Genetics and health are factors in healthy hair. Proper nutrition is important for hair health. The living part of hair is under the scalp skin where the hair root is housed in the hair follicle. The entire follicle and root are fed by a supply of arteries, and blood carries nutrients to the follicle/root. Any time an individual has any kind of health concern from stress, trauma, medications of various sorts, chronic medical conditions or medical conditions that come and then wane, heavy metals in waters and food, smoking etc. these and more can affect the hair, its growth, and its appearance. Generally, eating a full diet that contains protein, fruits, vegetables, fat, and carbohydrates is important (several vitamins and minerals require fat in order to be delivered or absorbed by the body). Any deficiency will typically show first in the hair. A mild case of anemia can cause shedding and hair loss. Among others, the B group of vitamins are the most important for healthy hair, especially biotin. B5 (pantothenic acid) gives hair flexibility, strength and shine and helps prevent hair loss and graying. B6 helps prevent dandruff and can be found in cereals, egg yolk and liver. Vitamin B12 helps prevent the loss of hair and can be found in fish, eggs, chicken and milk. When the body is under strain, it reprioritizes its processes. For example, the vital organs will be attended to first, meaning that healthy, oxygenated blood may not feed into the hair follicle, resulting in less healthy hair or a decline in growth rate. While not all hair growth issues stem from malnutrition, it is a valuable symptom in diagnosis. Scalp hair grows, on average, at a rate of about 1.25 centimeters per month, and shampoos or vitamins have not been shown to noticeably change this rate. Hair growth rate also depends upon what phase in the cycle of hair growth one is actually in; there are three phases. The speed of hair growth varies based upon genetics, gender, age, hormones, and may be reduced by nutrient deficiency (i.e., anorexia, anemia, zinc deficiency) and hormonal fluctuations (i.e., menopause, polycystic ovaries, thyroid disease).The World of Hair, A Scientific Companion by Dr. John Gray, Macmillan Press Limited, 1977, pp. 23–24. The essential omega-3 fatty acids, protein, vitamin B12, and iron, found in fish sources, prevent a dry scalp and dull hair color. Dark green vegetables contain high amounts of vitamins A and C, which help with production of sebum and provide a natural hair conditioner. Legumes provide protein to promote hair growth and also contain iron, zinc, and biotin. Biotin functions to activate certain enzymes that aid in metabolism of carbon dioxide as well as protein, fats, and carbohydrates. A deficiency in biotin intake can cause brittle hair and can lead to hair loss. In order to avoid a deficiency, individuals can find sources of biotin in cereal-grain products, liver, egg yolk, soy flour, and yeast. Nuts contain high sources of selenium and therefore are important for a healthy scalp. Alpha-linolenic acid and zinc are also found in some nuts and help condition the hair and prevent hair shedding that can be caused by a lack of zinc. Protein deficiencies or low-quality protein can produce weak and brittle hair, and can eventually result in loss of hair color. Dairy products are good sources of calcium, a key component for hair growth. A balanced diet is extremely necessary for a healthy scalp and furthermore healthy hair.

Martin Secker) Kangaroo is a 1923 novel by D.H. Lawrence. It is set in Australia. Description Kangaroo is an account of a visit to New South Wales by an English writer named Richard Lovat Somers and his German wife Harriet in the early 1920s. This appears to be semi-autobiographical, based on a three-month visit to Australia by Lawrence and his wife Frieda, in 1922. The novel includes a chapter (\\"Nightmare\\") describing the Somers' experiences in wartime St Ives, Cornwall, vivid descriptions of the Australian landscape, and Richard Somers' sceptical reflections on fringe politics in Sydney. Ultimately, after being initially somewhat drawn to the Digger movement led by Benjamin Cooley - 'Kangaroo' - neither it nor the \\"great general emotion\\" of Kangaroo himself appeal to Somers, and in this the novel begins to reflect Lawrence's own experiences during World War I. On the other hand, Somers also rejects the socialism of Willie Struthers, which emphasises \\"generalised love\\". Australian journalist Robert Darroch – in several articles in the late 1970s, and a 1981 book entitled D.H. Lawrence in Australia – claimed that Lawrence based Kangaroo on real people and events he witnessed in Australia. The extent to which this is true remains a matter of controversy. Joseph Davis in D.H. Lawrence at Thirroul (1989) is sympathetic to the view that Kangaroo may be based on real events, but argues that it is impossible that Lawrence had time to meet clandestine political leaders in Sydney when he was too busy writing his novel in Thirroul. Davis feels it is more likely to have been a local south-coast identity associated with Thirroul who would have provided some of the details of Lawrence's political plot.Joseph Davis, \\"D. H. Lawrence at Thirroul, (1989), Sydney: Collins, Kangaroo is the fictional nickname of one of Lawrence's characters, Benjamin Cooley, a prominent ex- soldier and lawyer, who is also the leader of a secretive, fascist paramilitary organisation, the \\"Diggers Club\\". Cooley fascinates Somers, but he maintains his distance from the movement. It has been suggested by Darroch and others that Cooley was based on Major General Charles Rosenthal, a notable World War I leader and right-wing activist. It has been alleged that Rosenthal was involved with the Old Guard, a secret anti-communist militia. Similarly, according to Darroch, the character of Jack Calcott – who is the Somers' neighbour in Sydney and introduces Richard Somers to Cooley – may have been based on a controversial Australian military figure, Major John Scott, who was both an associate of Rosenthal and an Old Guard official. Another central character is Willie Struthers, a left-wing activist reputed to have been based partly on Willem Siebenhaar, who made Lawrence's acquaintance in Western Australia. Influence and film adaptation Kangaroo is sometimes cited as an influence on the Jindyworobak movement, an Australian nationalist literary group, which emerged about a decade later. Gideon Haigh saw fit to dub it \\"one of the sharpest fictional visions of the country and its people\\".Haigh, Gideon. Big pictures, artfully painted. 6 September 2008. http://content- rsa.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/current/story/361075.html (accessed 7 September 2008). It was adapted as a film, also called Kangaroo, in 1987, featuring Colin Friels as Somers, Judy Davis as Harriet and Hugh Keays-Byrne as Kangaroo. Further reading *D.H.

It is a state joint-stock company. Location and transportation VDNKh is located in Ostankinsky District of Moscow, less than a kilometer from Ostankino Tower. It is served by VDNKh subway station, as well as by Moscow Monorail. Cosmonauts Alley and the Worker and Kolkhoz Woman statue are situated just outside the main entrance to VDNKh. It also borders Moscow Botanical Garden and a smaller , and in recent years the three parks served as a united park complex. History1935–1939 construction= This section is based on Soviet public documentsavailable in Russian at www.bcxb.ru The exhibition was established February 17, 1935 as the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (VSKhV) (; Vsesoyuznaya Selsko-Khozyaystvennaya Vystavka). An existing site (then known as Ostankino Park, a country territory recently incorporated into the city limits), was approved in August 1935. The master plan by Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky was approved in April 1936, and the first show season was announced to begin in July 1937 and was design as a \\"City of Exhibitions\\" with streets and public spaces, which was very common in the 1930s of the 20th century. However, plans did not materialise, and three weeks before the deadline Joseph Stalin personally postponed the exhibition by one year (to August 1938). It seemed that this time everything would be ready on time, but again the builders failed to complete their work, and regional authorities failed to select and deliver proper exhibits. Some pavilions and the 1937 entrance gates by Oltarzhevsky were torn down to be replaced with more appropriate structures (most pavilions were criticised for having no windows). According to Oltarzhevsky's original plan, all of the pavilions were to be constructed from wood. In 1938, a government commission examined the construction and decided that it did not suit the ideological direction of the moment. The exhibition was considered too modest and too temporary. Oltarzhevsky was arrested, together with the Commissar for Agriculture and his staff, and eventually released in 1943. Later, he worked on the 1947-1953 Moscow skyscraper project. As a result, in August 1938 Nikita Khrushchev, addressing the assembled Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, declared that the site was not ready, and the opening was postponed until August 1939. It finally opened on 1 August 1939, and was open to the public between 08:00 and 23:00 until 25 October with a daily attendance of 40,000. The 1940 and 1941 seasons followed but following German invasion in 1941 the exhibition was closed until the end of World War II. 1939 pavilions, as presented in 1950 album and today: Image:Pavillion Kirgizia VDNKh 01.jpgPavilion of Kyrgyzstan Image:Belarus 2-VDNH-101008.jpgPavilion of Belarus Image:Pavillon Uzbekistan 01.jpgPavilion of Uzbekistan Image:Pavillion Karelia VDNKh 01.jpgPavilion of Karelia Image:ВДНХ.

Again, the opening was postponed more than once; the first post-war season opened in 1954 (still as Agricultural exhibition). In the 1956 season the planners set aside an Industrial area within the main territory; more restructuring and rebuilding followed. In 1959 the park was renamed Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy (, Vystavka Dostizheniy Narodnovo Khozyaystva) or ВДНХ/VDNKh. Space pavilion, 1980 By 1989 the exhibition had 82 pavilions with an exhibition area of 700,000 square metres. Each pavilion (including the 1939 \\"regions\\") had been dedicated to a particular industry or field: the Engineering Pavilion (1954), the Space Pavilion (1966), the Central Industrial Zones Pavilion (1955), the Atomic Energy Pavilion (1954), the People's Education Pavilion (1954), the Radioelectronics Pavilion (1958), the Soviet Culture Pavilion (1964). During Soviet times, each year VDNKh hosted more than 300 national and international exhibitions and many conferences, seminars and meetings of scientists and industry professionals. These events attracted about 11 million visitors annually, including 600,000 guests from outside the Soviet Union. The \\"Radioelectronics\\" exhibition hall for some years housed the working (and unique) prototypes of the most advanced ES EVM computers to date, which were time-shared by many research organisations right on the premises. The most memorable feature of the exhibition site was the Worker and Kolkhoz Woman (Rabochiy i kolkhoznitsa) statue, featuring the gigantic figures of a man and woman holding together the famous \\"hammer and sickle\\". The sculpture, which reaches 25 meters toward the sky, was designed by Vera Mukhina and originally crowned the 35-meter-tall Soviet pavilion at the Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937). The statue featured on a logo of Mosfilm, Russia's largest movie studio. =Present day= Space Pavilion with Vostok (rocket). The Tupolev Tu-154 (reg. no. SSSR-85005, prod. no. 70M005, 1970 year of production, Model 005) in front of the pavilion was dismantled on September 14, 2008. This Tupolev Tu-154 was used as a flight testbed. The centre of oceanography and marine biology \\"Moskvarium\\" In 1992, VDNKh was renamed, receiving the new acronym VVC, which remained in use until 2014. It occupies 2,375,000 square metres of which 266,000 square metres are used for indoor exhibits. The territory of VDNKh is greater than that of the Principality of Monaco and has approximately 400 buildings. Inadequate maintenance of Vera Mukhina's statue caused such disrepair that the statue was disassembled. It was slated to be refurbished and installed on the top of the new pavilion by 2008, but funding shortages lead to dragged-out restoration. It was finally reerected in December 2009, now standing atop of a large constructivist pavilion, apparently recreating the original exhibition pavilion from the 1937 World's Fair in Paris that it was designed for. The \\"VDNKh\\" (or VVTs) complex still operates including the name of a nearby subway station and some sights: * pavilions * fountains * a luna-park * Cosmonautics museum * a rocket and even a Buran spaceсraft * The centre of oceanography and marine biology “Moskvarium” (or Moscow Oceanarium): 80 aquariums, 8000 species of sea creatures from all over the world including 500 species of fish, killer whales, three metre sharks, dolphins and Russian sturgeon. During winter, VDNKh converts into a main Skating Rink with a total area of and the ice surface of more than , with a capacity of 4,500 people that can use the rink at the same time. It's the biggest skating rink in Russia and Europe. Restoration On 14 May 2014 the previous name VDNKh was restored, following an interactive poll. In addition, the mayor of Moscow announced that the Russian space shuttle, the structural test article - TVA, which was an attraction and restaurant at Gorky Park in Moscow was to be moved to the VNDKh, to be displayed near the Vostok rocket in front of the Cosmos hall. It was moved 5–6 July 2014 and re-assembled by 21 July. In addition there is a Su-27 fighter jet on display. Currently, the larger international exhibitions are mostly held at the new facilities of Moscow Expocentre.

The Friendship of Nations fountain The exhibition centre was built in the era of Joseph Stalin. The place selected was Moscow's northern suburb Ostankino. The main planner was Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky who planned a central avenue with fountains, small roads and a large square facing the central pavilion at the end of the avenue. A statue of Vladimir Lenin used to stand in the front of the pavilion. In the central square there is a big fountain called, Fontan Druzhba Narodov. In English it means, Friendship of People Fountain. Designed in the shape of an octagon, the fountain was created to glorify the people of the Soviet Union. There is another fountain called \\"The Stone Flower Fountain\\" facing the Ukraine Pavilion. There is a smaller square facing the Space Pavilion in the centre of which stands a Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft, placed there in the 1960s after the pavilion of Agricultural Machinery became the Cosmos Pavilion. A large statue of Joseph Stalin stood in the square until 1948. This had previously stood on the banks of the Moskva River in the city centre. The square is called The Industrial Square. The northern area of the site is an area shared between the exhibition centre and the botanic gardens of the nearby Russian Academy of Sciences. In it are agricultural pavilions and estate pools with vegetation including: Michurin's Garden and the Golden Spike Fountain. All the fountains in the centre are covered with gold. There are also many statues situated throughout the site, particularly of Soviet leaders. In addition, the site houses cinemas, cafés, theatre pavilions as well as a church built after the fall of the Soviet Union. In the southern area of the complex, near the central entrance there is an Amusement Park with the Moscow-850 Ferris wheel. It was built in 2004 as part of Moscow's 850th anniversary celebration. The restored Soviet pavilion from Expo 67 in Montreal is now the Moscow Pavilion. Soviet architects' planned the pavilions and Soviet artists' designed the fountains. Designed in Stalinist architecture, some pavilions were built in the wedding cake style; such as the Central Pavilion that was famous in the Communist States at that time. In 2008, the Big Constructivist Pavilion was built as a replica of the original Soviet pavilion. In 2009, the renovated statue of Worker and Kolkhoz woman was erected on top of the building. The Worker and Kolkhoz woman sculpture was originally created to crown the Soviet pavilion of the World's Fair. The organizers had placed the Soviet and Nazi pavilions facing each other across the main pedestrian boulevard at the Trocadéro on the north bank of the Seine. Today visitors can rent a car or a bicycle to tour the site.

He had a lot of fights with bureaucrats there. One morning he found that his tables and chairs had been taken away on the back of a Department of the Interior truck. As a result of the public outcry, those tables and chairs were returned. .... In 1974 he had further problems with the department in relation to some awnings and some poles which did not have the correct approval.

She is best known for her depiction of American women and as a leading member of the Fourteenth Street School of artists. Early life and education Bishop was born the youngest of five siblings in Cincinnati, Ohio. Founders of a prep school in Princeton, New Jersey, her parents were highly educated individuals and descendants from East coast mercantile families. Though the family descended from old wealth, their immediate status was of the middle class, and financial insecurity forced the family to move often. Her father was a scholar of Greek and Latin. Her mother was emotionally indifferent and distant from Bishop; she was a suffragist, feminist and aspiring writer who urged her daughters to become independent, strong women. After the family relocated to Detroit, Bishop began her art education at the age of 12 in a Saturday morning life drawing class at the John Wicker Art School in Detroit.Todd, Eileen. The \\"New Woman\\", p. 57 In 1918, at the age of 16 she moved to New York City to study illustration at the New York School of Applied Design for Women. After two years there she shifted from illustration to painting, and attended the Art Students League for four years until 1924. It was there that she studied with Guy Pène du Bois and with Kenneth Hayes Miller, from whom she adapted a technique which owed much to baroque Flemish painting. In addition, she learned from other early modernists including Max Weber and Robert Henri. During the early 1920s she also studied and painted in Woodstock, New York. In 1963, she went to Yale University School of Fine Arts, New Heaven. Bishop was described as an eager intellectual who was naturally inquisitive and independent in her ways. In this period, women were becoming very active in the arts community, yet were still taken for granted. Bishop pushed against this attitude toward women artists with her insistence on applying herself both academically and politically in the art realm. Throughout her educational ventures, she was fully funded by her father's cousin, James Bishop Ford, who aided her family in their time of need. Writing on this financial sponsorship, Isabel Bishop states that she viewed her gender as an advantage: \\"I was lucky. I think if I had been a man the relative who sponsored my whole studenthood might not have done so. Men are supposed to make their own way. Young women were supposed to marry. But a young woman putting so much time and effort—being so serious—that was different—that interested him. I don't think he would have subsidized me if I had been a boy.\\" Career Throughout the 1920s and 1930s she developed a realist style of painting, primarily depicting women in their daily routine on the streets of Manhattan. Her work was greatly influenced by Peter Paul Rubens and other Dutch and Flemish painters that she had discovered during trips to Europe. In 1932, Bishop began showing her work frequently at the newly opened Midtown Galleries, where her work would be represented throughout her career.Todd, Eileen. The \\"New Woman\\", p. 58 In 1934, Bishop married Dr. Harold G. Wolff, a neurologist, and moved to Riverdale New York. However, she continued to work in a loft studio near Union Square at 9 West Fourteenth St, which she continued to use until 1984. She became interested in the interaction of form and ground and the mobility of everyday life, what she called \\"unfixity\\", life and movement captured on canvas.Bishop, Isabel, and Karl Lunde (1975) Isabel Bishop. New York: Abrams. Her style is noted for its sensitive modeling of form and \\"a submarine pearliness and density of atmosphere\\".Lunde, Karl. p. 27 During this time, Bishop began working in various printing techniques, most notably aquatint. Her work was included in the first three iterations of the Whitney Biennial in 1932, 1934, and 1936, as well as ten subsequent annual exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art. She returned to the Art Students League as an instructor from 1936 to 1937. In 1940, Bishop was elected into the National Academy of Design as an associate member, and became a full member in 1941. Her work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. In 1938, she painted a post office mural, Great Men Came from the Hills, in New Lexington, Ohio, through the Section of Painting and Sculpture. According to the Ohio Historical Society, “In Isabel Bishop’s mural for New Lexington, historic personages from the town admire their achievements across the valley, where we see the forms and silhouettes of distant buildings. The artist, from New York City, discovered that the townspeople were proud of the distinguished people who came from Perry County. She included a Revolutionary soldier, a governor of Wisconsin, a founder of New Lexington and his grandson, an author of reference books on Ohio, the developer of the coal industry, a senator, a newspaperman, a naturalist, the county’s first historian, and General Sheridan.” Bishop's mature works mainly depict the inhabitants of New York's Union Square area. Her portraits are often studies of individual heads (see Laughing Head, 1938, Butler Institute of American Art); the emphasis securely on the subject's expression – or of solitary nudes. Bishop also painted multiple-figure compositions, often containing two females engaged in various workday interactions. In the post-war years, Bishop's interest turned to more abstracted scenes of New Yorkers walking and traveling, in the streets or on the subways. Her signature changed many times over her career, ranging from the use of various pseudonyms to initials; some early pieces are signed I.B, or I. Bishop in both block and script. Her work remains significant as an example of the thematic concerns of the Fourteenth St. School, as well as her contribution to feminism and the \\"new woman\\" emerging in urban landscapes. The \\"Fourteenth Street School,\\" was a loosely affiliated group named for the area around Union Square, where Bishop, Reginald Marsh, and the brothers Raphael Soyer and Moses Soyer worked. In the mid-1940s, E. P. Dutton commissioned Bishop to illustrate a new edition of Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice. Bishop produced 31 pen-and-ink drawings (the originals are now at the Pierpont Morgan Library). The first retrospective exhibition of Bishop's work was held during her lifetime at the University of Arizona Museum of Art in 1974.  Awards  In 1943, Bishop was awarded the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter presented her with the Outstanding Achievement in the Arts Award. In 1987, she received a Gold Medal for Painting by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Notable works Virgil and Dante in Union Square, 1932, Oil on canvas, Delaware Art Museum This piece hung in Bishop's Riverdale home for more than seven years, and set the leitmotif of her career.Lunde, Karl. p. 23 As a child, Bishop became familiar with the story of Virgil and Dante through her mother, who was translating the text from Italian. Dante's journey through heaven and hell represented the extraordinary depth to life and its many experiences. The two figures standing in front of Union Square adds a narrative element to the bustling scene of life in a city of millions, and sets the scene for her various paintings and prints of urban life. Two Girls, 1935, Oil and tempera on Masonite, Metropolitan Museum of Art One of Bishop's most well-known works, the painting took more than a year to complete and was shown at the Midtown Galleries.Lunde, Karl. p. 35 For the piece, Bishop had two acquaintances from the Union Square area pose, wanting to capture the interaction of the two figures. The piece was painted with oil and tempera. Encounter, 1940, Oil and tempera on Masonite, St Louis Art Museum In Encounter, Bishop continues with her multiple-figure compositions capturing a scene of interaction between a man and a woman on a city street. Her depiction of the woman as forthright and confident, approaching the man and backing him against a wall, exemplifies Bishop's understanding of shifting gender roles at the time. Tidying Up, 1941, Oil on Masonite, Indianapolis Museum of Art Tidying Up depicts a young female office worker in the midst of checking her teeth in a compact mirror. The ungainly image of self-inspection accords with Bishop's realism and her interest in the daily lives of working women. The rough brushstrokes and surface texture exhibit an interest in old master paintings.  Exhibitions  * Isabel Bishop: exhibition of paintings and drawings, Jan. 17-Feb. 4.

Alessandro Piccolomini (13 June 1508 – 12 March 1579) was an Italian humanist, astronomer and philosopher from Siena, who promoted the popularization in the vernacular of Latin and Greek scientific and philosophical treatises. His early works include Il Dialogo della bella creanza delle donne, o Raffaella (1539) and the comedies Amor costante, and Alessandro, (other titles are erroneously attributed to him) which were sponsored and produced by the Sienese Accademia degl'Intronati, of which he was a member and an official. Much of his literary production consisted of translations from the Classics, of which Book xiii of Ovid's Metamorphoses and book vi of the Aeneid are early examples. In 1540, while a student at the University of Padua, he helped found the Infiammati Academy, in which he gave lectures in philosophy. (He never taught at the University of Padua, as is often stated incorrectly.) His poetry, in which he followed the Petrarchan tradition, appeared first in various contemporary collections, and in 1549 he published as a single volume one hundred sonnets titled Cento sonetti. Later in life, he established in his sister-in-law's Villa of Poggiarello of Stigliano, near Siena, where he attended the revision of his previous essays, and where he wrote all his late works, as the translation of Aristotle's Poetics on which he wrote a learned commentary issued in 1575. His interest in Aristotle included the publication of a paraphrase of Aristotle's Rhetoric with commentary. In his Trattato della grandezza della terra e dell' acqua (1558), he opposed the Aristotelean and Ptolemaic opinion that water was more extensive than land. The treatises Sfera del mondo e Delle stelle fisse (The sphere of the world and The fixed stars) (1540), in which he adhered to Ptolemaic theories, were some of his major contributions to the field of astronomy. He also wrote, at the behest of Cosimo de' Medici, a proposal for reforming the calendar (1578). In 1574 Pope Gregory XIII appointed him titular bishop of Patras (Patrae) and Coadjutor Archbishop of Siena.\\"Archbishop Alessandro Piccolomini\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney.

The Green Spring conflict is labelled \\"le 6 Juillet\\". The Battle of Green Spring took place near Green Spring Plantation in James City County, Virginia during the American Revolutionary War. On July 6, 1781 United States Brigadier General \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne, leading the advance forces of the Marquis de Lafayette, was ambushed near the plantation by the British army of Earl Charles Cornwallis in the last major land battle of the Virginia campaign prior to the Siege of Yorktown. Following a month of marching and countermarching in central Virginia by Cornwallis and Lafayette, Cornwallis in late June moved to Williamsburg, where he received orders to move to Portsmouth and send some of his army to New York City. Lafayette followed Cornwallis fairly closely, emboldened by the arrival of reinforcements to consider making attacks on the British force. On July 4, Cornwallis departed Williamsburg for Jamestown, planning to cross the James River en route to Portsmouth. Lafayette believed he could stage an attack on Cornwallis's rear guard during the crossing. Cornwallis anticipated Lafayette's idea, and laid an elaborate trap. General Wayne's forces were very nearly caught in the trap, and only a bold bayonet charge against the numerically overwhelming British enabled his forces to retreat. Cornwallis did not follow the victory with pursuit, instead following his plan to cross the river. The action reinforced the perception among contemporaries that justified the moniker \\"Mad\\" to describe Wayne, although opinion on the merits of his actions was divided. The battlefield has been partially preserved, and reenactments are sometimes staged. Background In May 1781, Earl Charles Cornwallis arrived in Petersburg, Virginia after a lengthy campaign through North and South Carolina. In addition to his 1,400 men, he assumed command of another 3,600 that had been under the command of the turncoat Benedict Arnold, and was soon thereafter further reinforced by about 2,000 more sent from New York.Wickwire, p. 326. See preceding pages for details of Cornwallis' Carolina campaigning. These forces were opposed by a much smaller Continental Army force led by the Marquis de Lafayette, then located at Richmond.Clary, pp. 303-304 Following orders originally given to Arnold's predecessor in command, William Phillips (who died a week before Cornwallis's arrival), Cornwallis worked to eliminate Virginia's ability to support the revolutionary cause, giving chase to Lafayette's army, which numbered barely 3,000 and included a large number of inexperienced militia.Wickwire, pp. 328–329Clary, p. 305 Lafayette successfully avoided engaging Cornwallis, who used his numerical advantage to detach forces for raids against economic, military, and political targets in central Virginia. After about one month of this activity, Cornwallis turned back to the east, marching for Williamsburg. Lafayette, whose force grew to number about 4,000 with the arrival of Continental Army reinforcements under General Anthony Wayne and additional experienced militiamen under William Campbell, followed Cornwallis.Clary, pp. 303–309 Buoyed by the increase in his troop strength, Lafayette also became more aggressive in his tactics, sending out detachments of his force to counteract those that Cornwallis sent on forage and raiding expeditions. One such foray led to a clash at Spencer's Ordinary, a crossroads not far from Williamsburg, in late June.Wickwire, p. 335 When Cornwallis arrived at Williamsburg, he received orders from General Sir Henry Clinton to go to Portsmouth and prepare a detachment of troops to return to New York City. Pursuant to these orders, Cornwallis began moving south on the Virginia Peninsula on July 4, planning to cross the wide James River at the Jamestown ferry.Wickwire, pp. 340–341 Lafayette followed, with advance units and most of his Continentals reaching Norrell's Mill, about from the ferry on July 5.Johnston, p. 60 Lafayette saw an opportunity to attack the British force as it made the difficult crossing of the James. Cornwallis also recognized the possibility, and decided to lay a trap, hoping to capture a portion of Lafayette's army.Clary, pp. 310–311 He only sent his baggage train and John Graves Simcoe's Queen's Rangers across the river, and concealed his main force near the crossing. Cornwallis also sent men to \\"desert\\" to the Americans with information that most of the British force had crossed, leaving only a rear guard on the north side of the river.Wickwire, p. 343 Prelude Brigadier General Anthony Wayne, 18th-century engraving The position where Cornwallis hid his army was well-chosen. To the left, impassable swampy terrain sloped down toward the river. To the right, there was more marshy ground and a few ponds. The access from the rest of the mainland toward the ferry was via a causeway from the Green Spring Plantation that was surrounded by marshlands that an advancing army would have to negotiate.Clary, p. 311 The earl arranged his army in two lines, with the 76th and 80th regiments along with part of the 43rd and Banastre Tarleton's British Legion on the left, and the Brigade of Guards, and Hessian auxiliaries on the right. Both wings also included light infantry companies. Cornwallis left a small company of German jägers and a few men from the Legion to give the appearance of a rear guard picket, and gave them specific orders to resist the American advance as much as possible.Wickwire, p. 344 Brigadier General \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne led Lafayette's advance company, about 500 men, out early on July 6 from Norrell's Tavern.Johnston, pp. 60,66Clary, p. 310 When Wayne reached Green Spring, he surveyed the terrain and noted the presence of the British guards. When Lafayette came up with his main force, the two men decided to go ahead with the attack, but Lafayette ordered more troops forward from Norrell's Tavern around 1 pm. Some minor skirmishing took place while they awaited these troops.Johnston, p. 61 Wayne's 500 soldiers included 200 Virginia riflemen under Majors John Willis and Richard Call backed by additional light infantry led by John Francis Mercer, William Galvan, and McPherson. Colonel Walter Stewart's Pennsylvania Continental battalion formed the reserve. Lafayette sent forward two Pennsylvania Continental battalions under Colonels Richard Butler and Richard Humpton, and Major John P. Wyllys' light infantry battalion. Beginning to suspect something was amiss, Lafayette held back the light infantry battalions of Colonels Francis Barber and Joseph Vose.Boatner, p. 451 The three-battalion reinforcement increased the size of the force Wayne ordered into the swamps around 3:00 pm to between eight and nine hundred men.Lossing, p. 466 Wayne's force now consisted of two companies of riflemen, one of dragoons, and most of the Pennsylvania Line, and included three pieces of field artillery.Lossing, pp. 466-467 As they moved out, Lafayette rode out toward a spit of land on the riverbank from which he might observe the action.  Battle  Wayne's advance force and the British pickets then began an extended skirmish lasting nearly two hours. The British forces slowly retreated, suffering significant casualties under the persistent American advance. Wayne's riflemen performed particularly well, picking off several of the British commanding officers.Johnston, p. 62 However, the tables turned around 5 pm when the Americans reached an \\"abandoned\\" gun that Cornwallis had left in the road. Their seizure of the gun was the signal for the British counterattack, which began with a barrage of canister and grape shot, and was followed by an infantry charge. Marquis de Lafayette, portrait by John Opie Lafayette, from his vantage point on the river, had spotted the main British force and realized that Wayne was entering a trap. However, he was not able to reach Wayne in time to recall him. He immediately began moving additional troops forward in an attempt to prevent the trap from closing on Wayne.Lossing, p. 468 In the meantime, the British charge had thrown the Americans into some confusion, and Wayne was concerned that a retreat would turn into a disorderly rout. Wayne reformed his line, ordered his artillery to fire a blast of grape shot, and then had the line charge the numerically overwhelming British with bayonets fixed. Wayne's audacious charge worked; it successfully halted the British advance long enough for Lafayette's covering force to approach. Lafayette rode forward to assist in managing the American retreat, which began to crumble after Cornwallis personally led a countercharge. During the retreat, two of the American guns had to be abandoned because their horses were shot, and Lafayette was also unhorsed. As the sun was beginning to set, Cornwallis chose not to pursue the Americans, who retreated to Green Spring.Wickwire, p. 345  Aftermath  British reports of casualties in the battle listed 5 officers and 70 enlisted men killed or wounded. American casualties were reported to number about 140, including 28 killed. Cornwallis, satisfied with the victory, did not pursue the retreating Americans, and instead crossed the James as planned and moved on to Portsmouth.Wickwire, pp. 347–349 There his arrangements to embark troops were countermanded by new orders from Clinton that instead ordered him to use his force to establish a fortified naval station.Wickwire, p. 349 This Cornwallis chose to do at Yorktown, where he was compelled to surrender after a brief siege in October 1781.Wickwire, pp. 349–385 Earl Cornwallis, detail of painting by Thomas Gainsborough Lafayette, in his dispatches and reports throughout the later stages of the Virginia campaign, painted Cornwallis's movements to Williamsburg and Portsmouth as a retreat. These reports bolstered Lafayette's reputation, and the battle, although a tactical setback, did not harm that reputation.Clary, p. 312 General Wayne wrote of his decision to charge the full British force that it was \\"one of those prudent, tho' daring manoeuvers which seldom fail of producing the desired effect; the result in this Instance fully Justified it.\\"Nelson, p. 137 Lafayette publicly lauded Wayne's performance, but recorded privately that Wayne made tactical mistakes and the battle read well \\"in a gazette\\". Militia general Peter Muhlenberg blamed the loss on \\"the impetuosity of our brother Brigadier.\\" Wayne biographer Paul Nelson opines that Americans of the day could \\"hardly decide after the battle whether to admire Wayne for his brave and impetuous character or to condemn him as a foolhardy adventurer.\\" Legacy Portions of the Green Spring Plantation were purchased in 1966 by the National Park Service, and are now part of the Colonial National Historical Park.Friends of Green Spring – History These holdings were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and are, as of June 2010, open only by special arrangement.Friends of Green Spring – LocationNational Register Information System NotesReferences    External links *The 2d Virginia Regiment, Inc.

It lies on the junction of the A633 and A6195 roads and is bordered by the Trans Pennine Trail long-distance path. Following the end of coal mining locally, the Dearne Valley had become a derelict post-industrial area, and the removal of soil to cover an adjacent polluted site enabled the creation of the wetlands at Old Moor. Old Moor is managed to benefit bitterns, breeding waders such as lapwings, redshanks and avocets, and wintering golden plovers. A calling male little bittern was present in the summers of 2015 and 2016. Passerine birds include a small colony of tree sparrows and good numbers of willow tits, thriving here despite a steep decline elsewhere in the UK. Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council created the reserve, which opened in 1998, but the RSPB took over management of the site in 2003 and developed it further, with funding from several sources including the National Lottery Heritage Fund. The reserve, along with others nearby, forms part of a landscape-scale project to create wildlife habitat in the Dearne Valley. It is an 'Urban Gateway' site with facilities intended to attract visitors, particularly families. In 2018, the reserve had about 100,000 visits. The reserve may benefit in the future from new habitat creation beyond the reserve and improved accessibility, although there is also a potential threat to the reserve from climate change and flooding. Landscape Most of the Dearne Valley area lies on the coal measures, comprising Carboniferous sandstone and slate with seams of coal. The valleys contain fertile alluvium deposited by their rivers, and the sandstone forms rolling ridges cut by the broad floodplains. The area has been settled continuously since prehistoric times, with villages developing on the drier sandstone ridges above the flood plain from at least the late Saxon period. Mining is recorded from at least the 13th century, and probably back to Roman Britain,Ling et al (2003) pp. 30–33. and the area became heavily industrialised in the 18th century with the arrival of the Dearne and Dove Canal. This connected Barnsley to the River Don and beyond, aiding the intensive exploitation of the locality's coal, sandstone and iron ore. Over the next two centuries, especially following the arrival of the railway in 1840, the area became dominated by its heavy industries. The name Old Moor may derive from an archaic meaning of moor, referring to a marshy area that was more difficult to cultivate than the alluvium of the flood plain.Hey (2015) pp. 75–77. It had been enclosed as a farm by 1757, when it was owned by the Marquess of Rockingham. History The Dearne Valley was formerly a major coal mining area, with several accessible seams of high- quality coal, and in 1950s more than 32,000 colliers worked in its 30 pits. The coal industry dominated the area, and its waste rendered the River Dearne lifeless, although a few isolated wetland areas remained, monitored by local birdwatchers. The miners' strike of 1984 was the first sign of a national programme of pit closures in the UK that led to all the Dearne Valley mines being closed by 1993, with the loss of 11,000 jobs in the industry. About of the former Wath Manvers Colliery, including a coking plant and marshalling yard, was left as the largest derelict site in western Europe. The ground was heavily polluted and needed to be restored by covering it with clean soil deep enough for trees and scrubs to become established. To achieve this, of material was removed from the adjacent Old Moor, thereby creating a new wetland at that site. The Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT) were originally intended to run the proposed reserve, and planned a large lake for wintering wildfowl. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) suggested adding reed beds to help the then-struggling bittern population; only 11 males were present in the UK at one point in the 1990s. The WWT was at that time also working on its London Wetland Centre, and pulled out of the Old Moor project since it lacked the resources to cope with two large projects. The creation of the reserve fell to Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, which offered the site to the RSPB in 1997. At that time, the bird charity was more interested in preserving established habitats than creating new sites, and declined to take on Old Moor. The reserve eventually opened in 1998 as part of the regeneration of the Dearne Valley, and was then developed further with the help of a lottery grant of nearly £800,000 in 2002. By 2000, the reserve had only 10,000 visitors annually, and was making a financial loss before being taken over by the RSPB in 2003. The RSPB had changed it its position since its refusal in 1997, with a greater emphasis nationally on engaging the public, and more opportunities to work with the Environment Agency to create and manage new wetlands. With help from the Environment Agency, local councils and others, the RSPB tripled its land holding in the area to in the next ten years, while other conservation bodies also created and improved reserves. Cooperation between conservation organisations and other agencies led to the formation of the Dearne Valley Landscape Partnership (DVLP) in 2014. This is the main coordinating body for the partners in the Dearne Valley scheme,King (2014) p. 1. which include the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), local councils, Natural England, The Environment Agency, the Forestry Commission, Yorkshire Water, the RSPB and several local conservation charities. The DVLP is supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and its administration is the responsibility of Barnsley Council's Museums and Heritage Service. The partnership's remit includes industrial heritage sites as well as the local environment, and its funding for 2014–2019 was £2.4 million, of which £1.8 million was from the National Lottery. Access and facilities thumbMap of reserve hides family and photographic activities visitor centre water reed beds meadow grass and other vegetationalt=Map of reserve showing trails and habitats Old Moor lies about from the M1 motorway, and is accessed from Manvers Way (A633) just east of the A6195 Dearne Valley Parkway junction. The nearest railway stations are at Wombwell and Swinton, both about away. Buses are infrequent, but cyclists can access Old Moor by a bridge to the reserve car park from the Trans Pennine Trail long-distance path, which runs along the southern edge of the reserve. The reserve has a visitor centre, created by Barnsley Council from existing farm buildings, which includes a shop, educational facilities, a café and toilets, picnic and play areas and nature trails. The visitor centre and its café are open daily from 9.30 am–5.00 pm, except for 25 and 26 December, the reserve having the same hours in winter but staying open until 8 pm from April to October. Entrance is free for RSPB members, although there are entry charges for other visitors. Old Moor was planned as an \\"Urban Gateway\\" RSPB site, its playground, café balcony and children's discovery zone intended to attract visitors. It has nine bird hides and viewing screens, and a sunken hide with a reflection pool for the benefit of photographers. The track to the reed bed is long and the main track is . As of 2018, the reserve had about 100,000 visits per year, with around 3,500 children annually making use of the RSPB's on-site education programmes.King (2014) p. 9. The site uses wood pellets and chippings to fuel a 100 kW biomass converter which provides hot water and heating for five buildings on the site. Management The main focus on management throughout the Dearne Valley complex is on its key habitats: wet grassland, open water and reed bed. Although the first reeds were planted at Old Moor in 1996, their establishment has been slow because the topsoil had been stripped off leaving only hard sterile clay subsoil for planting. Bringing fertile mud from Blacktoft Sands RSPB reserve has helped, although the reeds still stand in ribbons rather than solid blocks. The reed beds are cut when mature to encourage new growth, and are divided into four sections which can be separately drained. alt=a group of recumbent cattle Wet grassland is kept short for breeding waders through grazing by cattle or Konik horses, and by mowing. Ditches are cleared in rotation, and islands are flooded in winter, if possible, to suppress vegetation. Surviving plants are then cut down, and the soil is rotavated to break up the hard clay and deter invasive New Zealand pygmyweed. As a man-made site, Old Moor has a complex water-management system that allows water levels to be controlled in separate compartments of the wetland. In general, water levels are kept high in winter, then lowered to expose the islands for breeding and passage waders. The Dearne Valley is one of 12 Nature Improvement Areas (NIAs) created as part of the UK Government's response to Sir John Lawton's 2010 report \\"Making Space for Nature\\", which proposed managing conservation on a landscape scale. Plans to manage the Dearne Valley on a landscape-wide basis involve coordination with other wetland reserves. Five smaller sites are already managed by the RSPB; these are Bolton Ings and Gypsy Marsh close to Old Moor, and Adwick Washlands, Wombwell Ings and Eddersthorpe Flash within a few miles. Other reserves are the Garganey Trust's Broomhill Flash and the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust's (YWT) Denaby Ings. The YWT also manages Barnsley council-owned Carlton Marsh, and the Environment Agency is restoring marshes at Houghton Washland. Other parcels of land are being acquired by the various conservation charities as they become available. The Dearne Valley reserves have no statutory protection, but as of 2019, the process to become a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is under way. Fauna and floraBirds= alt= a large heron-like bird Since the 1990s the RSPB has been attempting to create improved habitats for the formerly endangered UK bittern population, with major reed bed creation at their Ham Wall and Lakenheath Fen reserves being a key part of the bittern recovery programme initiated in 1994 as part of the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan. At Old Moor, in addition to the creation of new reed beds, 23,000 small fish were introduced between 2010 and 2016, mainly of species such as rudd and eels that are preferred as food by bitterns. This project increased the fish biomass more than twenty-fold to . Breeding waders include lapwings, redshanks, snipe and avocets, the last species having bred on the reserve since 2011. Predation of wader chicks by foxes has been a problem, so deep ditches and electric fences are being introduced to exclude mammals. Black-headed gull numbers have increased from 183 breeding pairs in 2006 to 2,385 pairs in 2017, and have been joined by Mediterranean gulls, eight being present in 2018. Old Moor is an important wintering site for golden plovers, although numbers have dropped from 6,000–8,000 to 2,000–3,000 in about twenty years. Passerine birds include a small colony of tree sparrows, currently stable at about ten pairs, and good numbers of willow tits. Willow tits are in steep decline in the UK, disappearing completely from many areas, but numbers are increasing in the Dearne Valley, particularly at Old Moor, where a breeding density of 6.7 territories per square km (17.4 territories per square mile) was the highest in the locality. The post-industrial landscaping and planting in the area have created a suitable habitat for the species containing willow, alder and clumps of bramble close to water and linked by linear features such as railways, canals and streams. Cetti's warbler and bearded tit have recently colonised the reserve, and up to three pairs of barn owls breed there. A calling male little bittern summered in 2015 and 2016, and appeared for a few days in 2017. Other recent rarities include a Baird's sandpiper in 2016, a thrush nightingale and gull-billed tern in 2015, and a black stork in 2014. =Other animals and plants= Brown hawker dragonfly Lesser noctule bats and water voles figure among the scarcer mammals found on the reserve, and otters have returned to the now-clean rivers. Other mammal species targeted for monitoring during the creation process include the brown hare and the pipistrelle. The alder leaf beetle, formerly believed extinct in the UK, has colonised the Dearne and other local river catchments, probably introduced when the pollution-tolerant Italian alder was planted on restored land. Other uncommon insects found at Old Moor include the great silver water beetle, the longhorn beetle Pyrrhidium sanguineum, the dingy skipper butterfly, and a day-flying moth, the six-belted clearwing. Nationally scarce nocturnal moths include the cream-bordered green pea and chocolate-tip, while the red-eyed damselfly and red-veined and black darters are notable among the Odonata. Several rare flies have been recorded, including three species, Parochthiphila coronata, Calamoncosis aspistylina and Neoascia interrupta, otherwise known in the UK only from a few sites in the East Anglian fenland. An unusual plant gall found on creeping bent was caused by the nematode Subanguina graminophila. Scarce plants include yellow vetchling and hairy bird's-foot trefoil. Marsh orchids flower in grassy areas in the summer, and the same species, along with the bee orchid, has colonised the verges of the adjacent Manvers Way. Other scarce plants found in the area include hairlike pondweed, pond water-crowfoot and greater pond sedge. Threats and opportunities alt=A signpost with bird models on the arms The Dearne Valley is a natural washland with a capacity of , and as such it can normally absorb overflow from its river. The floods of 2007 overwhelmed the storage capacity and covered the whole of Old Moor to hide-roof level, only the visitor centre being untouched. In the longer term, the reserve might be adversely affected by climate change, perhaps leading to alterations in the populations of woodland species.King (2014) p. 15. More positive effects may arise as the local environment improves, with habitat creation occurring beyond the reserve and better accessibility.King (2014) pp. 61–62.King (2014) pp. 141–143. A survey by the DVLP showed that 44% of respondents said that they liked to visit the local wildlife reserves, with another 17% mentioning waterways and lakes. When asked what they liked about the Dearne Valley area, 35% of replies said nature and wildlife.King (2014) p. 65. The success of Old Moor has led to the creation of similar RSPB reserves close to urban areas at Rainham Marshes east of London, Newport Wetlands in South Wales, and RSPB Saltholme on Teesside.

It is of volcanic origin and located in the southwest of the state in the counties of Emmendingen and Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald. In terms of natural regions it is considered to be a part of the Upper Rhine Plain. Name The name \\"Kaiserstuhl\\" is believed to refer to King Otto III, who held court near Sasbach on 22 December 994. From then on, the whole hill range was called the Königsstuhl – the King’s Chair. In May 996, Otto III was crowned Emperor and the King’s Chair eventually became the Emperor’s Chair – \\"Kaiserstuhl\\". Reliable sources mention the name Kaiserstuhl only as early as 1304 and historians thus suppose that the term Kaiserstuhl was not coined until the 13th century. GeographyLocation= The Kaiserstuhl is situated in South Baden, mainly in Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald county or district. However, the smaller northern part belongs to Emmendingen. Within the Upper Rhine Plain it is situated about 16 km northwest of the city of Freiburg, right next to the eastern bank of the Rhine and a short distance west of the Dreisam. It reaches up to 377 metres above the level of the Rhine downstream (179.5 m a.s.l.) from the weir close to Burkheim. At its greatest extent, from the Michaelsberg near Riegel in the northeast, to the Fohrenberg, by Ihringen in the southwest, the Kaiserstuhl is about 15 km long. Its maximum width is about 12.5 km. = Hills = The hills of the Kaiserstuhl include the following (sorted by height in metres above sea level): *Totenkopf (556.6 m), 1.9 km east of Bickensohl; with the Vogtsburg 1 telecommunication tower and Neunlinden observation tower * Eichelspitze (521.3 m), 2.8 km northwest of Bötzingen * Katharinenberg (492.4 m), 1.3 km southeast of Amoltern * Bisamberg (469.0 m), 1.2 km south of Amoltern * Staffelberg (446.0 m), 1.5 km northwest of Schelingen * Badberg (432.7 m) (protected area), 1.5 km east of Oberbergen * Holzeck (431.9 m), 1.7 km northeast of Ihringen; with tower * Hochbuck (374.8 m), 900 m south of Achkarren * Schlossberg (352.1 m), 500 m northwest of Achkarren; with Höhingen Castle ruins * Böselsberg (340.1 m), 500 m northwest of Wasenweiler * Büchsenberg (283.7 m), 1.3 km west of Achkarren  Towns and villages  Towns and villages in and around the Kaiserstuhl (in alphabetical order) are: *Bahlingen * Bötzingen *Breisach * Eichstetten * Endingen with Amoltern, Kiechlinsbergen and Königschaffhausen * Ihringen with Wasenweiler * Riegel am Kaiserstuhl * Sasbach with Jechtingen and Leiselheim *Vogtsburg with Achkarren, Bickensohl, Bischoffingen, Burkheim, Oberbergen, Oberrotweil and Schelingen *Wyhl Geology The formation of the Kaiserstuhl volcano during the Tertiary was the climax and at the same time the end of volcanic activity in the Upper Rhine Valley Rift. Volcanism started as early as the Cretaceous Period. Volcanic landforms include heavily eroded volcanic vents. The Kaiserstuhl is the only larger volcano from this period in the rift valley. Geologically the Kaiserstuhl can be divided into two parts: the sedimentary and volcanic part. Due to these peculiarities the Kaiserstuhl has been labeled one of the most important national geotopes. =Sedimentary base= The horizontal sedimentary layers forming the eastern third of the Kaiserstuhl date back to the Jurassic and the Tertiary long before the volcanic activity. Important stratigraphic outcrops include the Hauptrogenstein (local oolite) which is found mainly near the village of Riegel and the Pechelbronner Schichten (local Tertiary layers in the South German Scarplands) near Bötzingen. During the formation of the Upper Rhine Plain this part of the Kaiserstuhl sloped less in respect to its surrounding area – and thus appears as a so-called horst. In terms of its geological structure and the sequence of its escarpments, the Kaiserstuhl is comparable to the nearby Tuniberg, Nimberg and also to the Schönberg, which is situated south of the city of Freiburg. =Volcanic activity= Peridotite xenolith in a nephelinite lava flow, Kaiserstuhl Petrologically the volcanic Kaiserstuhl is an alkali-carbonate rock formation. The volcanic rocks making up a large part of the central and western Kaiserstuhl were the result of numerous volcanic eruptions during the Miocene, about 19 to 16 million years ago. They cover parts of the sedimentary base of the eastern Kaiserstuhl, which is why in some places changes in the base’s mineralogical composition occurred. The driving force behind this process of contact metamorphism was an increase in temperature. Due to the alternate eruption of tephra and lava flows from several vents a complex stratovolcano came into existence. Some of the rising magma solidified as volcanic intrusions below the surface – and today forms the central part of the Kaiserstuhl. Laterally rising phonolite magma also intruded into the sedimentary base of the Eastern Kaiserstuhl. Several hundred metres of the original volcano have been eroded. =Volcanic rocks= Polished limburgite, Kaiserstuhl The entire volcanic Kaiserstuhl consists of rock types that contain feldspathoid minerals and olivine and are undersaturated with SiO2. Most igneous rocks at the surface are leucite-tephrites, with subordinate phonolites, limburgites, and olivine-nephelinites (at the Limberg Mountain near Sasbach), the last of which is rich in xenoliths from the Earth’s mantle. Carbonatite ignimbrite and lapilli are local peculiarities; they can be found in places in the western part of the Kaiserstuhl (Henkenberg near Burkheim, Kirchberg near Oberrotweil). The subvolcanic and intrusive rocks of the central Kaiserstuhl are plutonic equivalents of the erupted material (essexite, carbonatite and coarse-granular phonolite). Several local terms which do not carry official status with the International Union of Geological Sciences have been used for different varieties of the intrusive rocks. Of major scientific interest is the consolidated carbonatite near Altvogtsburg und Schelingen. It is a quite rare volcanic rock, which crystallized from a carbonate magmatic melt rather than a silicate one. Given its unusual composition for an igneous rock, the magmatic nature of the carbonatite was not proposed for a long time and remained doubtful subsequently. An alternative interpretation was that it was a metamorphically altered sedimentary rock, examples of which can be found nearby. Only in the 1950s and 1960s did research prove that it was a carbonatite; one of the clues was identification of the eruptive carbonatites found in the western part of the Kaiserstuhl. The carbonatite contains the niobium rich pyrochlore; attempts to mine the carbonatite rock for niobium were carried out in the middle of the 20th century, but the amount turned out to be too small to be economical. =Minerals= For a long time the Kaiserstuhl has been known for rare minerals. Examples include the quarries at the Limberg (zeolites), Badberg (carbonatites), Orberg and Fohberg. Well-crystallized minerals can be found predominantly in clefts or cavities in the volcanic rock. =Loess= Loess alley near Vogtsburg-Bickensohl, Kaiserstuhl The Kaiserstuhl is today largely covered by a Quaternary loess layer, a loosely cemented sediment. It is derived from other rocks through erosion and is then transported by the wind. The loess at the Kaiserstuhl – as in all the peripheral areas of the Upper Rhine Valley – was formed during the last Ice Age. Large parts were bare of vegetation and so loess was winnowed out from the Rhine sediments. It was then deposited in the periglacial area (i.e. ice-free, but surrounded by glaciers) at the Kaiserstuhl. The major process active here was frost weathering resulting in crushed rocks. The wind blew strongly, as there was no vegetation that could have moderated it – entraining the lightest material and depositing it at obstacles like the Kaiserstuhl. Deposition took place northeast of the Kaiserstuhl, as the winds blew from the southwest. The higher the place of sedimentation, the thinner the layer of the sedimented material is. At the Kaiserstuhl the thickness of the loess layer varies between 10 and 40 metres. There are, however, also areas in the southwest where no loess has been deposited. The Northern Limestone Alps are considered the main source of the Kaiserstuhl loess. A rust-coloured band occurs at irregular intervals. It developed as a new material and did not arrive regularly but in phases of different intensities. In a phase of weak sedimentation the material on top weathered – and the calcium carbonate was washed out. It then precipitated further down and formed a particular type of soil horizon, which contains concretions of calcium carbonate. The Kaiserstuhl loess soils are used for intensive farming, as they offer good aeration, high water storage capacities and good mechanical qualities. Besides, as a result of farming deep narrow ravine-like paths developed. As the loess developed over time it is, furthermore, significant for flood control. Sponge-like, it absorbs and then gently releases rainfall. This quality is however lost when bulldozers, employed to construct large terraces for viticulture, compress the loess. Climate General = The Kaiserstuhl is one of the warmest regions in Germany. The winters are relatively mild for the area, and the summers are warm or even hot, with possible average temperatures of over in July and August. Because of its loess covered volcanic soils it is a very good wine- producing region. The climatic situation of the Kaiserstuhl is outstanding in the area. It is rain-shadowed by the Vosges Mountains, under the climatic influence of the Belfort Gap and is characterized by a drier and hotter climate, which one would rather expect not to be typical of the area. Despite this, winters remain cold and dry, and summers wet, in comparison with Mediterranean climate (which instead has a rainfall peak during winter, which can see few frost days, and a dry season in summer). =Meteorological data= The average annual temperature is , with 50–60 days with a maximum temperature above as well as 60–70 days with a minimum temperature below . This illustrates a special feature of the Kaiserstuhl: it is characterized by its relatively extreme climate. The average difference between the lowest and the highest average temperatures within one year is . The mean precipitation at the Kaiserstuhl is approximately , with about 1,720 hours of sunshine per year.  Flora and fauna  Orchis simia The climate of the Kaiserstuhl also explains the vast richness of thermophile flora and fauna. The Kaiserstuhl is for example one of the places with the largest variety of orchids in Europe – more than 30 species have been recorded. Among the vines wild grape hyacinths sprawl and along acclivities iris plants blossom. Furthermore, sand lizards (lacerta bilineata) and praying mantis (Mantis religiosa) live here – species which mainly occur in the Mediterranean area. (However, according to the latest research results the sand lizard presumably belongs to the allochthone species of the European green lizard (Lacerta viridis)). The pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens) is a Xerophyte and normally only occurs in Southern Europe, but is also able to survive at the Kaiserstuhl. This species has a disjunct distribution, which means away from its normal habitat. It is a relict of a postglacial warm period where there had been a much warmer climate around the Kaiserstuhl. After the end of the warm period only the named species were able to survive. Besides there is a larger population of the May beetle (Melolontha melolontha). In spite of protests from conservationists the May Beetle is controlled by the use of insecticides. Conservation area In the centre of the Kaiserstuhl between the Vogt Burger districts of Schelingen and Oberbergen and the somewhat remote eastern community of Eichstetten lies two direct neighbouring natural Designated Conservation Areas (DCA), the DCA Badberg (DCA No. 81345), which was established in 1969, is 65 hectares high and has many rare plants (e.g. Orchids), and the eastern add-on DCA Haselschacher Buck (DCA no. 163542) which was founded in 1989 and is 71.3 hectares in size. Furthermore, in Kaiserstuhl there is a large number of small Designated Conservation Areas. The bigger part, in particular in its centre belongs to the Fauna Flora Habitat area of the Kaiserstuhl (FFH no. 7911-341).  Economy  The Kaiserstuhl and its surrounding area is a region of intense wine growing. Wines from the Kaiserstuhl have achieved an excellent reputation which has by now become international. The bigger part of the available area is covered with vineyards. They are either run as parts of winemaking cooperatives or are private property or property of private vineries. Because of the volcanic soils, vines grow particularly well. Varietals grown in the Kaiserstuhl: Müller-Thurgau, Riesling, Silvaner, Ruländer, Blue Spätburgunder, Grauburgunder, Weißer Burgunder, Gewürztraminer. Changes in landscape The terrain of the Kaiserstuhl has been altered by the people living there since it was settled. The loam there is strongly susceptible to erosion as a result of soil cultivation, thus terraces had to be added, which were then mostly used as vineyards, as well as fruit growing or for other agricultural uses. As a result, the typical small \\"patio\\" hillsides and the streaked loess sunken roads typical of the region came into being. To start with, it was for this reason that smaller terraces were merged in around 1950, this resulted in large scale reallocation, which turned parts of the original landscape completely upside down. The phases of this reallocation were:- * Small-scale realignment between 1950 and 1960. At the same time the terrain was generally modified by manual labour with the help of in-house machines. During this time approximately 950 hectares were enclosed by the farmland consolidation authority. * Between 1960 and 1970 the loess slopes were more comprehensively modified, whereby large rectiform terraced areas with corresponding high embankments were made. The terraces were arranged with mountain like slopes so that now only the multiple slope edges are visible from the valley. About 650 hectares of the surface were styled in this way. * The plans to create large- scale terraces made between 1970 and 1976 were executed with the help of heavy machinery, changing the landscape radically. Before the original, naturally formed, depressions had still been visible in the gentle hillsides with only small terraces. Natural and man-made structures existed side by side. However, these small-scale structures were then obliterated completely. Monstrous areas resembling fortresses and entirely incongruous to the region were created. The total wine-growing area of the terraces was 630 ha. As the embankments and other areas exceeded the size of the wine-growing areas, the changes affected more than twice the newly created arable area. The land reforms of Oberrotweil-Oberberg, Ihringen-Abtsweingarten, Eichstetten-Hättlinsberg and Endingen am Kaiserstuhl-Schambach are examples of this phase. * The last phase of wine-growing land reforms was realized between 1976 and 1982. Due, in part, to protests against plans for further large scale terraces the changes were not as radical as the previous phase: the maximum height for embankments was \\"limited\\" to 10 m and their shapes were \\"made smooth and adjusted to the landscape\\" (Mayer 1986, citation translated). This procedure was, for example, applied to about 330 ha of wine-growing area in Oberbergen-Baßgeige or in Bickensohl-Herrenstück. From 1977 on, several longer periods of enhanced precipitation caused damage to the embankments. During one week in May 1983 for example, the amount of precipitation was so large that in some areas it was equivalent to one third of the annual average, causing great damage in the modified areas. The surfaces of the acclivities often slid off together with the vegetation. Former valleys, which had been blocked due to re-allocation, were flushed out. In some terraces dramatic shear failures developed. In addition extensive, devastating frost damage occurred; due to the incline of the mountainside at the surfaces of the acclivities, cold air pockets were formed in which the vines in bloom were frostbitten. Additionally substantial frost damage occurred in the woody part of the vines, especially in the vineyards which were situated in lower regions. In earlier times fruit had mostly been grown here but later this was changed to vineyards. The activity of the farmland consolidation authority was narrowed to repairing and partly to rescheduling which at least was meant to correct the most severe consequences of the transformations from 1982 on.  Transport links  The Kaiserstuhl area is served by the A 5 motorway. Major local roads are the L 113 that links the A5, the north side of the area and the French border; and the B 31 which connects the southside of the area with the French border, A 5 and Freiburg i.B. The area is also served by Breisgau S-Bahn. The Kaiserstuhl Railway runs past the range to the east, north and west, whilst the Breisach Railway passes it to the south.  Hiking  There are many opportunities for hiking in the Kaiserstuhl. The best known trail is the North-South Trail (check mark: blue rhomb on yellow background) from Endingen across the Katharinenberg and the Totenkopf and the Neunlinden viewing point to Ihringen. From the trail there are panoramic views over the Black Forest, the Upper Rhine Valley and the Vosges. In 2007, eight trails were opened, each with a special theme. They have a total length of 140 km and were integrated into the existing trail network (check mark: yellow rhomb on white background) of the Black Forest Club. In doing so, the network was provided with 430 new signposts. Large information boards with an overview map and site information are placed at central points, for example in railway stations, which the trails link to, or through built up areas. Every trail is distinguished by its own colour and the names have a corresponding symbol displayed on entranceways and signposts. A further 120 smaller themed paths illuminate local attractions along the way. Local paths such as the Brunnenpfad (7 km) in Bötzingen were integrated into the new network of themed paths. * Neunlindenpfad (North-south trail): Ihringen-Endingen, 16,8 km. * Steinkauzpfad: Wasenweiler-Riegel, 17,9 km. * Wiedehopfpfad: Breisach-Sachbach/Limberg, 31,5 km. * Knabenkrautpfad: Breisach-Bötzingen, 21,5 km. * Kirschbaumpfad: Sasbach-Riegel, 18,4 km. * Katharinenpfad: Vogtsburg-Oberrotweil-Bahlingen, 12,6 km. * Badbergpfad: Vogtsburg-Oberrotweil-Nimburg, 14,9 km. * Bienenfresserpfad: Ihringen- Königschaffhausen, 16,1 km. In 2010, the Kaiserstuhlpfad was added to the eight theme trails. This trail was given a special status as a \\"Quality Trail of Wonderful Germany\\" (Qualitätswanderweg Wunderbares Deutschland). The trail, which has a length of 21.7 km, was adapted to the Neunlindenpfad (North-South Trail) and leads from Endingen through the Ehrle Valley to St. Catherine's Chapel (Katharinenkapelle), across the Badberge hills to the Eichelspitz Tower, onward across the Vogelsang Pass to the Neunlinden Tower, through the Eichgasse to Bickensohl and across the Kreuzbuck through the Lenzengasse to Ihringen.

Typical Cantabrian Mountains landscape in winter The Cantabrian Mountains or Cantabrian Range () are one of the main systems of mountain ranges in Spain. They stretch for over 300 km (180 miles) across northern Spain, from the western limit of the Pyrenees to the Galician Massif in Galicia, along the coast of the Cantabrian Sea. Their easternmost end meets the Sistema Ibérico. These mountains are a distinct physiographic province of the larger Alpine System physiographic division. The Cantabrian Mountains offer a wide range of trails for hiking, as well as many challenging climbing routes. Skiing is possible in the ski resorts of Alto Campoo, Valgrande- Pajares, Fuentes de Invierno, San isidro, Leitariegos and Manzaneda. Geography The Cantabrian Mountains stretch east-west, nearly parallel to the sea, as far as the pass of Leitariegos, also extending south between León and Galicia. The range's western boundary is marked by the valley of the river Minho (), by the lower Sil, which flows into the Miño, and by the Cabrera River, a small tributary of the Sil. Cantabrian mountains reach its south- western limit in Portugal. As a whole, the Cantabrian Mountains are remarkable for their intricate ramifications, but almost everywhere, and especially in the east, it is possible to distinguish two principal ranges, from which the lesser ridges and mountain masses radiate. One range, or series of ranges, closely follows the outline of the coast; the other, which is loftier, forms the northern limit of the great tableland of Castile and León, and is sometimes regarded as a continuation of the Pyrenees. In some parts the coastal range rises sheer above the sea, and everywhere has so abrupt a declivity that the streams which flow seaward are all short and swift. The descent from the southern range to the high plateaux of Castile is more gradual, and several large rivers, notably the Ebro, rise here and flow to the south or west. The breadth of the Cantabrian chain, with all its ramifications, increases from about 60 mi (97 km); in the east to about in the west. Many peaks are over high, but the greatest altitudes are attained in the central ridges on the borders of León, Asturias, Palencia and Cantabria. Here are the highest peak Torre de Cerredo (), Peña Vieja (), Peña Prieta () and Espigüete (); an unnamed summit in the Picos de Europa, to which range the Peña Vieja also belongs, rises on the right bank of the Sella to a height of ; further west the peaks of Manpodres, Peña Ubiña, Peña Rubia and Cuiña all exceed . A conspicuous feature of the chain, as of the adjacent tableland, is the number of its parameras, isolated plateaus shut in by lofty mountains or even by precipitous walls of rock. The Cantabrian Mountains make a sharp divide between \\"Green Spain\\" to the north, and the dry central plateau. The north facing slopes receive heavy cyclonic rainfall from the Bay of Biscay, whereas the southern slopes are in rain shadow. Main ranges The Cantabrian Range has three very distinct sections from west to east: = Western= The Asturian Massif and its foothills.

To complete the lineup, they recruited the Skinnerbox rhythm section of Anna Milat-Meyer on bass and James Blanck on drums, as well as guitar player, Nick Bacon of The Erratics. History The band released one demo tape and played many New York City area shows, before self-releasing their debut, self-titled album, in 1998. Response was positive enough, that the band was signed to Mojo Records, and they released Chawalaleng, one year later. Soon after their major label debut, Anna Milat-Meyer and James Blanck, left the group. Anna Milat-Meyer took a position, playing bass, in Latin Jazz band, Los Mas Valientes. Carl Barc, of the band Ever Since Day One, took over on bass and Dave Karcich, formerly of Spring Heeled Jack, took over on drums. The band continued to tour, and build a strong fanbase. The band recorded a live show at CBGB's, intending for it to be released on CD. The album would never see release though, since the band split up on July 13, 2001. Soon after the breakup Coolie Ranx started a solo career, recording and playing shows around the world with back up band Fear Nuttin' Band. Nick Bacon joined Lost City Angels, who were looking for a second guitarist. On December 9, 2001, Nobile, Barc and Karcich, joined with Spring Heeled Jack guitarist, Mike Pellegrino to perform as Cenzo for a Ska For Youth benefit show to raise money for the Twin Tower Orphan Fund after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Karcich also took the drum position in Avoid One Thing, a band fronted by former Mighty Mighty Bosstones bass player, Joe Gittleman. Karcich suffered a sudden brain aneurysm and died on April 5, 2002. Eight months later, a tribute show was held at Toad's Place, in honor of Karcich. During a performance by Cenzo, Nobile and Barc welcomed Coolie Ranx and Nick Bacon onstage for a brief Pilfers reunion. On November 4, 2005, the original five members of Pilfers, reunited at the Knitting Factory, in New York City for a sold-out show. Two more reunion shows took place at the same location on May 6, 2007 and January 25, 2008. Coolie Ranx continued with his solo career as Vinny Nobile continued with Cenzo who promoted their album Maybe Now. Nick Bacon continued to pursue other musical projects in New York City, making his film debut in the 2007 Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant film, Music and Lyrics. In 2009, he appeared on Rescue Me as a member of Mike Lombardi's band, Apache Stone. In 2008, Pilfers performed nine shows outside of NYC, including six shows in November with Sonic Boom Six. Pilfers performed two shows on the second leg of the Ska is Dead 4 tour. They played on November 14, 2009 at the Showcase Live in Foxboro, MA, and November 15, 2009 at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, NJ. Pilfers performed for a Haiti benefit concert at the Knitting Factory on April 23, 2010 with Karen Gibson Roc, Tsunami Rising, and Across The Aisle. In November 2011, Connecticut's Asbestos Records and Chicago, IL's Underground Communiqué Records launched a fundraiser together on Kickstarter to release Pilfer's self-titled album on vinyl, among other third-wave ska classics from The Pietasters, Edna's Goldfish, and Suburban Legends. If the funding goal was met by January 18, 2012, the records were scheduled to be released later in the year. In 2013, Pilfers toured with Reel Big Fish across the U.S. and Canada. Joining for this tour was Ben Basile (bass) and Billy Kottage (trombone/keys). In addition, Pilfers, with their original lineup, headlined a show at The Gramercy Theater on January 19, 2014. This show marked the first time that Coolie Ranx and his son, singer-songwriter/rapper Mark U, will share the same stage.

State Road 54 (SR 54) is located in the Tampa Bay Area, north of Tampa itself, and runs from US 19 in Elfers in the west to US 301 in Zephyrhills, in the east. In between it passes through Wesley Chapel, Land o' Lakes, and Elfers. Route description SR 54 is a six-lane divided highway from its western terminus at US 19. In between County Roads 77 and 1 in Seven Springs, the road moves southeast along the Mitchell Bypass, which crosses over the Anclote River the moment it moves away from Old CR 54. The segment between Trinity Boulevard and Gunn Highway in Odessa was rebuilt and relocated along a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad right-of-way that ran from Pinellas County where much of the Pinellas Trail exists today into Trilby. Pasco County created a gap in this route between the western terminus of State Road 56 and the northern terminus of State Road 581 by exchanging maintenance responsibilities with FDOT for those caused by the newly created SR 56. This western segment of SR 54 became CR 54. This western CR 54 segment has been widened to six lanes from just west of Interstate 75 to the resumption of State Road 54 at State Road 581, and the six lane highway continues eastward as State Road 54 from that point to a point east of Curley Road, where the highway currently (as of 2012) ends. A West Zephyrhills Bypass has been proposed between a location east of the intersection with CR 577 (Curley Road) and the north end of the merger of CR 579 and the eastern segment of CR 54, also known as Eiland Boulevard, near Zephyrhills. In the meantime, State Road 54 remains a two-lane undivided highway from the end of the newer highway to SR 54's eastern terminus at US 301 in downtown Zephyrhills. HistoryFormer Segments= Seven Springs: *Old County Road 54(Fifth Avenue), Little Road(CR 1), Gunn Highway Odessa: *Abandoned State Road 54 R.O.W.: Gunn Highway from CR 996 to Old Gunn Highway. *Black Lake Road Land o' Lakes: *Catfish Lake Lane Cypress Creek: *Cabbage Swamp Road *Memorial Drive Wesley Chapel: *County Road 54 (Western segment), left as a gap in the state road when State Road 56 was constructed. Zephyrhills: *State Road 54 continued from its present terminus at US 301 along a concurrency with 301 to the present-day eastern segment of County Road 54, where it followed present CR 54 eastward to US 98 and the Pasco-Polk County line(see below). Major intersectionsRelated routesCounty Road 54 (Zephyrhills-Branchborough)= Besides the gap between SRs 56 and 581 in Wesley Chapel, County Road 54 is a county extension of SR 54 south of Dade City. It begins at County Road 579 (Morris Bridge Road) west of downtown Zephyrhills and runs north in a short overlap with that road until it curves east, and runs east along Eiland Boulevard, while CR 579 continues north along Handcart Road. This intersection is also the site of the eastern terminus of the proposed West Zephyrhills Bypass. Turning briefly to the southeast it then moves straight east and wes along a former segment of North Avenue, only to turn northeast again at the intersection with the existing North Avenue, then turns stright before encountering County Road 41, and then an intersection with U.S. Route 301, where it catches hidden SR 54. East of US 301 the road runs towards the northeastern outskirts of Zephyrhills. Before this it encounters and intersection with 12th Street and Wire Road, which is where a former segment of SR 54 used to turn north from 12th Street then east to the present CR 54 until that route was relocated to the hidden route along US 301. Once CR 54 leaves the city north of Zephyrhills Municipal Airport it has an intersection with the western terminus of County Road 54 Alternate (see below) on the northwest corner of an at-grade crossing with the CSX Yeoman Subdivision, and east of that crossing encounters a major county road known as CR 535 (Zephyrhills Bypass). From there, the road takes a slight turn to the northeast as it crosses another CSX railroad line known as the Vitis Subdivision, and then runs along the northern border of the Upper Hillsborough Wildlife Management Area. Shifting back straight east and west again, it approaches the southern terminus of Alternate CR 35 in Lumberton, although ALT CR 35 may have overlapped CR 54 east of here at one time. Beyond this point it passes through the aforementioned wildlife management area where it approaches a narrow bridge over the Hillsborough River, thus running along the Pasco-Polk County line, both side of which consist of private property once again until it finally reaches US 98 in Branchborough. =State Road 54A= State Road 54A, known locally as Black Lake Road, is a road located in Odessa, Florida totaling . Portions of the road were once part of State Road 54 until it was realigned to bypass the suburbs it runs along. Despite the realignment, Black Lake Road is still maintained by FDOT. It consists of two separate roads, both named Black Lake Road, as well as a cul de sac, originally connecting to the current SR 54. =County Road 54 Alternate= County Road 54 Alternate is a bannered alternate of CR 54 east of the Zephyrhills City Limits. It begins on the west side of the CR 54 at-grade crossing of the CSX Yeoman Subdivision, as Forbes Road and almost immediately turns straight north From there it curves east onto Lynbrook Drive and crosses the very same railroad line with an at- grade crossing of its own. The only other road that passes for a major intersection at this point is CR 535 (Zephyrhills Bypass). Before Lynbrook Road becomes a dead end street in Lumberton, ALT CR 54 makes another north turn onto Elwood Road. It briefly turns northeast onto Merrick Road where it crosses another CSX railroad line known as the Vitis Subdivision, and after passing two dirt roads such as Lena Circle and Bayleaf Street finally turns straight east and west once again. ALT CR 54 remains at this trajectory until it officially ends at Alternate County Road 35, although as with its parent route, ALT CR 54 may have overlapped ALT CR 35 going south back to CR 54 at one time.

Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. She was also known for her artistic and entertainment endeavors and public speaking. Her childhood experience was greatly influenced by her father's highly public and influential activism. She was born two weeks before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a public transit bus in Montgomery, Alabama, she occasionally experienced threats to her life, designed to intimidate her parents, and became a secondary caregiver to her younger siblings and was bullied at school. When her father was assassinated on April 4, 1968, the 12-year-old Yolanda King was noted for her composure during the highly public funeral and mourning events. She joined her mother and siblings in marches, and she was lauded by such noted figures as Harry Belafonte, who established a trust fund for her and her siblings. In her teenage years, she became an effective leader of her class in high school and was given attention by the magazines Jet and Ebony. Her teenage years were filled with even more tragedies, specifically the sudden death of her uncle Alfred Daniel Williams King and the murder of her grandmother, Alberta Williams King. While in high school, she gained lifelong friends. It was the first and only institution where King was not harassed or mistreated because of who her father was. However, she was still misjudged and mistrusted because of her skin color, based on perceptions founded solely upon her relationship with her father. Despite this, King managed to keep up her grades and was actively involved in high school politics, serving as class president for two years. King aroused controversy in high school for her role in a play. She was credited with having her father's sense of humor. In the 1990s, she supported a retrial of James Earl Ray and publicly stated that she did not hate him. That decade saw King's acting career take off as she appeared in ten separate projects, including Ghosts of Mississippi (1996), Our Friend, Martin (1999) and Selma, Lord, Selma (1999). By the time she was an adult, she had grown to become an active supporter for gay rights and an ally to the LGBT community, as was her mother. She was involved in a sibling feud that pitted her and her brother Dexter against their brother Martin Luther King III and sister Bernice King for the sale of the King Center in Atlanta, Georgia. King served as a spokesperson for her mother during the illness that would eventually lead to her death. King outlived her mother by only 16 months, succumbing to complications related to a chronic heart condition on May 15, 2007. Early lifeEarly childhood: 1955–1963= Born in Montgomery, Alabama to Coretta Scott King and Martin Luther King Jr., she was only two weeks old when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus. Even in her infancy, Yolanda was faced with the threats her father was given when they extended to his family. In 1956, a number of white supremacists bombed the King household. Yolanda and her mother were not harmed. She and her mother, at the time of the bomb's detonation, were in the rear section of their home.Ramdin, p.37. Despite this, the front porch was damaged and glass broke in the home.Pierce, p.21. She kept her father busy when walking on their home's floors.Bruns, p.30. While her mother liked her name, her father had reservations about naming her \\"Yolanda\\" due to the possibility the name would be mispronounced. During the course of her lifetime, King's name was mispronounced to the point that it bothered her. King's father eventually was satisfied with the nickname \\"Yoki,\\" and wished that if they had a second daughter, they would name her something simpler.Branch, p. 128. The Kings would have another daughter almost eight years later named Bernice (born 1963). King recalled that her mother had been the main parent and dominant figure in their home, while her father was away often.Garrow, p.236. Decision-making towards what school she would attend in first grade was done primarily by her mother, since her father expressed disinterest to her early in the decision making.Dyson, p. 215. Martin Luther King III described his role as the second-born of their family as having made Yolanda jealous, and that she was always overcommitted but \\"still found time to get to the things that were most important to her\\". Her mother referred to her as being a confidant during the time following her husband's assassination. She complimented her mother on her achievements and her mother spoke of her in a positive light, as well. When asked by a young boy what she remembered most about her father, she admitted that her father was not able to spend much time with her and the rest of her family. When he did, she would play and swim with him. King cried when she found out her father had been imprisoned. Her father admitted that he had never adjusted to bringing up children under \\"inexplicable conditions\\".Bruns, p.64. When she was 6 years old, she was saddened by classmates' remarks that her father was a \\"jailbird\\". An important early memory was that she wanted to go to Funtown, a local amusement park, with the rest of her class, but was barred from doing so due to her race. She did not understand, and asked her mother Coretta why she was not able to go. When she replied \\"Your father is going to jail so that you can go to Funtown.\\" after numerous attempts to explain the issue to her, Yolanda finally understood. After having not seen her father for five weeks while he was in jail, she finally was able to meet with him alongside both of her brothers for less than half an hour.Ramdin, p.67. Her father also addressed the issue himself. He told her that there were many whites who were not racist and wanted her to go but there were many who were and did not want her to go. However, her father reassured her as she began to cry that she was \\"just as good\\" as anyone who went to Funtown and that one day in the \\"not too distant future\\" she was going to be able to go to \\"any town\\" along with \\"all of God's children\\". =Assassination of John F. Kennedy and Nobel Peace Prize: 1963–1964= On November 22, 1963, when U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, she learned of his death at school. When she returned home, she rushed to confront her mother about his death and even ignored her grandfather, Martin Luther King, Sr., to tell her mother what she had heard and that they would not get their \\"freedom now.\\" Her mother tried to debunk this, insisting that they would still get it. She predicted at that time that all of the \\"Negro leaders\\" would be killed and the non-leading African- Americans would agree to segregation. Her mother started to realize that Yolanda had become more aware of the possibility that her father could be killed as well.Vivian, p.62. For Christmas 1963, King and her siblings accepted a sacrificial Christmas as appealed by their parents and only received a single gift. King and her brother Martin III bragged about their selflessness at school.Vivian, p.58. In 1964, upon learning her father would receive the Nobel Peace Prize, she asked her mother what her father was going to do with the money he was receiving in addition to the award. After she suggested that he would most likely give it all away, King laughed with her mother. =Enrollment at Spring Street Elementary School and last years with father: 1965–1967= King and her brother Martin Luther King III were enrolled in the fall of 1965 to Spring Street Elementary School. In 1966, she listened to a speech her father gave when he was addressing a rally. At the age of eight after writing her first play, she enrolled in the only integrated drama school of that time. The head of the school was Walt Roberts, father of the actress Julia Roberts. She began speaking at the age of ten and even filled in for her parents on occasion. Her memories of her father prompted her to state that he \\"believed we were all divine. I have chosen to continue to promote 'we're one, the oneness of us, and shine the spotlight,' as my father did.\\" Coretta King wrote in her memoirs, My Life with Martin Luther King, Jr., that \\"Martin always said that Yoki came at a time in his life when he needed something to take his mind off the tremendous pressures that bore down upon him.\\" =Father's death: 1968= On the evening of April 4, 1968, when she was 12, Yolanda returned with her mother from Easter-dress shopping when Jesse Jackson called the family and reported that her father had been shot. Soon after, she heard of the event when a news bulletin popped up while she was washing dishes. While her siblings were trying to find out what it meant, Yolanda already knew. She ran out of the room, screamed \\"I don't want to hear it,\\" and prayed that he would not die. She asked her mother at this time, if she should hate the man who killed her father. Her mother told her not to, since her father would not want that.Sides, p.221. King complimented her mother as a \\"brave and strong lady,\\" leading to a hug between them. Four days later, she and her brothers accompanied their mother to Memphis City Hall on her own terms, as she and her brothers had wanted to come. King flew to Memphis, Tennessee with her brothers and mother and participated in leading a march in Memphis with sanitation workers and civil rights leaders.Burns, p. 118. King was visited by Mrs. Kennedy before her father's funeral. After the funeral, she was visited by classmates from Spring Street Middle School with flowers and cards. At that time, she was also called by Andrea Young, whose own father had insisted that she should. The two were the same age.Burns, p.75. Bill Cosby flew to Atlanta after the funeral and entertained King and her siblings.Sides, p.279. King and her siblings were assured an education thanks to the help of Harry Belafonte, who set up a trust fund for them years prior to their father's death. In regards to the possibility that her father could have been saved, King said she doubted that her father could have lived much longer given all the stress he had during his tenure as a leader of the Civil Rights Movement. She did admit that, had he lived or he been listened to more, \\"we would be in a far better place.\\" King openly stated years later that she did not hate James Earl Ray. =Teenage years and high school: 1968–1972= At Grady High School, King was president of her sophomore and junior class, and vice president of her senior class. She ranked in the top 10 percent of her class. She was active in student government and drama. She made lifelong friends while in the institution that would collectively be called the \\"Grady Girls\\". She was also on the student council.Farris, p. 192. At that time, King still did not know what she wanted to do with her life, but acknowledged that many wanted her to be a preacher.Jet interview, February 3, 1972. Her inclinations were driven to be artistic, which did not suit the political aspects of her father's life. Of the King children, Yolanda was the only one to attend Grady High School, as her siblings would go to different high schools following her graduation. During the family's interview with Mike Wallace in December 1968, Yolanda was introduced by her mother and revealed her role in keeping the family together. Being the oldest, she had to watch her three younger siblings; Martin Luther King III, Dexter King and Bernice King and referred to the three as independent when she watched them whenever their mother went out of town. Sometime after Martin Luther King's assassination, King told her mother \\"Mom, I'm not going to cry because my dad is not dead. He may be dead physically, and one day I am going to see him again\\". On July 21, 1969, King's uncle and father's brother Alfred Daniel Williams King was found dead in the swimming pool of his home. His youngest two children, Esther and Vernon, were vacationing with King and her family in Jamaica when they heard of his death. On April 4, 1970, the second anniversary of her father's death, she and her sister Bernice attended their grandfather Martin Luther King, Sr.'s silent prayer for their father at his gravesite. The practice of going to her father's grave on the anniversary of either his birth or assassination became an annual ritual for the King family to mourn his death. In her teenage years, King preferred to go by her nickname \\"Yoki.\\" As she said during an interview, \\"I prefer Yoki. Maybe when I'm older I won't be able to stand Yoki, but Yolanda sounds so formal!\\" She felt teenagers were confused and were using drugs as a method to escape their problems. At 15 she was subject to controversy when she appeared in the play The Owl and the Pussycat with a white male lead. Though her mother kept her naïve to the controversies so she could \\"fulfill [her] objective, which was to do the play\\", that did not stop her from learning of the negativity implemented from her role years later. Her grandfather Martin Luther King Sr. initially was not going to go to her performance due to opposition by locals, but changed his mind afterward. During a Sunday visit to Church, King was forced to stand before the congregation and explain her actions. In response to her role in the play and her own response to the role, a man wrote to Jet predicting that she would marry a white person before she was eighteen. Despite statements such as these, King did not become aware of the public discomfort with her role until years later, citing her mother's involvement in her knowledge of the criticism. When King was 16 she received attention in Jet in 1972, where she talked about what her father's famous name was doing for her life. In the interview with the magazine, She related how people expected her to be \\"stuck up\\" and referred to it as one of the \\"handicaps\\" of being Martin Luther King's child. She recalled having met a friend that was scared of being acquainted with her, because of her father's identity and expressed her thoughts in the colleges she wished to attend. King would ultimately attend Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts after graduating from high school. King called her father's name and having to live up to it a \\"challenge\\" and recalled a friend when she first met a friend of hers, who believed she could not say anything to King but after beginning to know her, realized that she was \\"no worse than my other friends\\" and she \\"could say anything\\" to her. King also voiced her dislike of the assumption that she would behave just like her mother and father, and the difficulty of being perceived as not being someone others could talk to. When asked what kind of world she would like to live in, King said she wished \\"people could love everybody\\". Despite this wish, she acknowledged that this was of no ease and expressed happiness that her father had changed many things, and even made some people gain self-esteem. Positive reception came to this interview, and Yolanda was even called the \\"leader of the 16-year-olds\\" for her \\"calmness, her concern,\\" and \\"her vision\\". Early adulthoodCollege: 1972–1976= After graduating from high school, she went to Smith College. She took classes taught by Manning Marable and Johnnella Butler, and became satisfied with her choice of a college. But after finishing her sophomore year and returning home so she could work over the summer, her grandmother Alberta Williams King was killed on June 30, 1974.Smith, p.386. With her death, the only remaining members of King's father's immediate family were her grandfather Martin Luther King, Sr. and aunt Christine King Ferris. She was also subject to some harassment by her classmates, describing it as the \\"era when students were making demands and many black students were closer to the teachings of Malcolm X, or what they thought were his teachings.\\" The children referred to her father as an \\"Uncle Tom\\" and she was scared that he would go down in history as such. She reflected \\"I had never read his works. I was just someone who loved someone, and I knew he had done great things and now people didn't appreciate it.\\" She proceeded to read his books, and started to believe that her father had been correct all along. When asked about what pressures emerged from being a daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., King stated that \\"as soon as people heard me speak, they would compare me to my father ... My siblings had the same kind of pressure. There was such a need, like they were looking for a miracle.\\" At the time of her turmoil in college, King recalled having not known Malcolm X and \\"didn't understand daddy, so here I was trying to defend something I thought I knew about but really didn't.\\"Rickford, p.423. On April 4, 1975, King joined her family in placing azaleas over her father's crypt, marking the seventh anniversary of his assassination. =Immediate life after Smith College: 1976–1978= An alumna of Smith College after graduating in 1976, she was the subject of an essay among the \\"remarkable women\\" during a celebration during the college's one hundred and twenty-fifth year and she was a member of the Board of Directors of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Inc. (the official national memorial to her father) and was founding Director of the King Center's Cultural Affairs Program. King became a human rights activist and actress. She stated in 2000 to USA Today, that her acting \\"allowed me to find an expression and outlet for the pain and anger I felt about losing my father,\\". Her mother's support helped in starting her acting career. Despite some early opposition to acting that she received during her controversial play in high school, King still tried to get roles and actively tried performing. She served on the Partnership Council of Habitat for Humanity, was the first national Ambassador for the American Stroke Association's \\"Power to End Stroke\\" Campaign, a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a sponsor of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, Human Rights Campaign, and held a lifetime membership in the NAACP. King received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, a master's degree in theater from New York University, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Marywood University. In 1978 she starred as Rosa Parks in the TV miniseries King (based on her father's life and released on DVD in 2005). =Meeting Attallah Shabazz: 1979= In 1979, Yolanda met Attallah Shabazz, the eldest daughter of Malcolm X, after arrangements had been made by Ebony Magazine to take a photograph of the two women together. Both were worried that they would not like each other due to their fathers' legacies. Instead, the two quickly found common ground in their activism and in their positive outlook towards the future of African-Americans. The two were young adults at the time and had a mutual friend who noticed they were both studying theater in New York and arranged for them to meet. A few months after King and Shabazz met, the pair decided to collaborate on a theatrical work, resulting in Stepping into Tomorrow. The play was directed towards teens and focused on the 10th year reunion of six high school friends. Stepping into Tomorrow led to the formation of Nucleus in the 1980s, a theater company which King and Shabazz founded.\\"Daughters of M.L. King, Malcolm X Tour With Play That Boosts Self Improvement\\", JET, November 22, 1982, at p. 31. The theater company was based in New York City and Los Angeles and focused on addressing the issues that their fathers, Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, spoke of in their lifetimes. The pair performed in around 50 cities a year and did lectures together, typically in school settings. Adult lifeKing holiday, arrests, and return to Smith College: 1980–1989= When presenting herself in 1980 to the GSA staff members, she stated: \\"Jim Crow [segregation] is dead, but his sophisticated cousin James Crow, Esq., is very much alive. We must cease our premature celebration [about civil rights already achieved] and get back to the struggle. We cannot be satisfied with a few black faces in high places when millions of our people have been locked out.\\" She received a standing ovation afterwards, alongside a thunderous applause. In February 1982, King was a speaker during the centennial of Anne Spencer's birth.Potter, p. 144. In 1984, she was arrested in the view of her mother for having protested in front of the South African Embassy, in support of anti-apartheid views. It was the first time she had ever been arrested. On January 7, 1986, Yolanda, her brother Martin Luther King III and her sister Bernice were arrested for \\"disorderly conduct\\" by officers responding to a call from a Winn Dixie market, of which had an ongoing protest against it since September of the previous year. She showed dissatisfaction with her \\"generation\\" on January 20, 1985, and referred to them as being \\"laid-back and unconcerned\\", and \\"forgetting the sacrifices that allowed them to get away with being so laid- back\\". That same year, she presented the Martin Luther King Jr. Award for Public Service to Chicago Mayor Harold Washington during the fifth annual Ebony American Black Achievement Awards. She celebrated her father's holiday on January 16, 1986 and attended a breakfast in Chicago with Mayor Harold Washington. She stated that her father had a \\"magnificent dream\\", but admitted that \\"it still is only a dream.\\" King started Black History Month of 1986 by giving a speech in Santa Ana, which called for the study of African-American history to not \\"relegated to the shortest and coldest month of the year.\\" After having been a public speaker for over twenty years, Yolanda recalled her talents having \\"happened very naturally growing up in a house like mine\\". She also found \\"great irony\\" in President Ronald Reagan having signed a bill to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a national holiday. She kicked off Martin Luther King Jr. Day by starting a week-long celebration on January 12, 1987 and talked to students about opportunities that they had at that point which their parents and grandparents did not have. On April 8, 1988, King and Shabazz were honored by Los Angeles County supervisors for their \\"unifying\\" performance and message on stage at the Los Angeles Theater Center the previous night. Their play Stepping into Tomorrow was praised by supervisors as being \\"entertaining and enlightening.\\" At the time of the honor, King said that their production company had been approached by organizations seeking to arrange special staging of the play for gang members before May 1, when the show's run would end. Supervisor Kenneth Hahn said to King that he \\"sensed I was in the presence of a great man when I met your father.\\" She returned to Smith College on January 26, 1989. There, she gave a speech and made references to her past difficult experiences when first coming to the college. King made it clear that while she had not been \\"endeared\\" to the institution, she was still \\"grateful\\" for her experience. She called for Americans to memorialize those who gave their lives for \\"the struggle for peace and justice.\\" At this point in her life, King also served as director of cultural affairs for the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change and was tasked with raising and directing funds for all artistic events. Was godmother of acclaimed actress RaéVen Larrymore Kelly. King and Kelly starred in three films together, HBO's \\"America's Dream\\" starring Danny Glover and Wesley Snipes, award-winning period film, \\"Odessa\\" that deals with racial unrest in which King gives a stellar performance as a nanny who lost her son to racial violence, and in Rob Reiner's film \\"Ghosts of Mississippi\\" about the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers starring Whoopi Goldberg and Alec Baldwin, King and Kelly played the adult and child versions of Reena Evers. =Arizona boycott and James Earl Ray retrial: 1990–1999= On December 9, 1990, she canceled a planned appearance in a play in Tucson, Arizona and ignored a boycott going on at the time by civil rights groups and other activists for Arizona voters rejecting the proposal of Martin Luther King Jr. Day being celebrated there. King and Shabazz had planned the play months before the voters of the state rejecting the holiday, and King prepared a statement which solidified her reasons for supporting the boycott. Despite this, Shabazz still appeared in the state and performed in the play. On January 17, 1991, Yolanda spoke before a crowd of students at Edmonds Community College, around 200 in number. She debunked complacency in having any role in progression of her father's dream. She joined her mother in placing a wreath around her father's crypt. King stressed in 1992 that love would help people make their mark on the world. That same year, she also spoke at Indiana University. In October, King gave support for a Cabrini-Green family that wants to escape the violence, and a fundraiser for their cause. 25 years after her father's assassination, she went to his gravesite. There, she joined hands with her siblings and mother along with other civil rights activists, singing We Shall Overcome. During July 1993, she agreed to speak at the Coral Springs City Centre for airfare and a fee in January 1994. She originally wanted $8,000, but was negotiated down to $6,500. During said speech, she mentioned that the fact that the poverty line in America among children had nearly tripled and urged people to \\"reach out\\" and \\"do what you can\\". In October, she uttered her belief that her father's dream of integration was not understood fully. On February 1, 1994 King attempted to speak before a diverse class of students at North Central College. She stated, \\"It is entirely appropriate that you would choose to focus on multiculturalism as the opening activity of Black History Month. The only reason why Black History Month was created and still exists is because America is still struggling and trying to come to grips, come to terms with the diversity of its people.\\" In July 1994, after seeing some photographs of her father prior to his death, Yolanda lamented that \\"this [had] brought back a lot of memories. It's often hard for young people to understand the fear and terror so many people felt and how bold they were to get involved in the marches. But walking through the first part of the exhibit I felt that terror.\\" She honored her father in 1995 by performing in the Chicago Sinfonietta in the play \\"A Lincoln Portrait\\", in which she was the narrator. The \\"commitment\\" to diverse members in the audience and the play itself, was what represented the opportunities for which King fought. In the fall of 1995, at age 39, she joined Ilyasah Shabazz and Reena Evers in saluting their mothers as they chaired an attempt at registering one million African-American women to vote in the presidential election of 1996.Rickford, p.483. King joined the rest of her family in February 1997, in supporting a retrial for James Earl Ray, the man convicted of her father's murder, having realized that \\"without our direct involvement, the truth will never come out.\\" In an interview with People magazine in 1999, she recalled when she first learned of her father's death and stated that \\"to this day, [her] heart skips a beat every time [she] hear one of those special bulletins.\\" King appeared in the film Selma, Lord, Selma, based on the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches as Miss Bright. Prior to the film's release, King expressed belief in children of the time only knowing \\"Martin Luther King Jr. was killed, but when it is time to talk about the facts and the history, there is not a lot of knowledge. They look at me when I'm talking as if this is science fiction.\\" Final years: 2000–2007 King attended and spoke at the Human Rights Campaign Detroit Gala Dinner of 2000. In a twenty-four-minute-long speech, she brought up the presidential election of that year, and also quoted the words of Bobby Kennedy by recalling his line which he took from George Bernard Shaw, that of \\"Some men see things as they are and say why? I dream things that never were and say why not?\\". During a presentation in May 2000, King was asked if the human race would ever become \\"color blind\\". In response, she pushed for \\"the goal\\" to be \\"color acceptance.\\" Following the September 11 attacks, King spoke in North Chicago in 2002 and related that her father's wisdom during the crisis would have been of great aid to her. She mentioned the possibility that the event could have been a calling for Americans to put their loyalty towards \\"their race, tribe and nation\\", as her father once said. She, her brother Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton sang We Shall Overcome in front of \\"The Sphere\\", which stood atop the World Trade Center prior to the September 11 attacks. In honor of her father, King promoted a show in Los Angeles entitled \\"Achieving the Dream\\" in 2001. During the play, she changed costume numerous times and adjusted her voice and body language when changing roles. King and Elodia Tate co-edited the book Open My Eyes, Open My Soul: Celebrating Our Common Humanity, published by McGraw-Hill in 2003. In January 2004, King referred to her father as a king, but not as one who \\"sat on a throne, but one who sat in a dark Birmingham jail.\\" While in Dallas in March 2004, King related; \\"It's only in the past half-dozen years or so that I have felt comfortable in my own skin. I don't have to try and prove anything to anyone anymore.\\" \\"I struggled with a lot of the legacy for a long time, probably actually into my 30s before I really made peace with it,\\" Yolanda stated in 2005 on \\"Western Skies\\", a public radio show based in Colorado. During the fall of 2004 she played Mama in \\"A Raisin in the Sun\\" at the Schwartz Center for the Performing Arts at Cornell University. =Mother's death, sibling dispute and final months: 2006–2007= King at the Out & Equal Workplace Summit, 2006 Coretta Scott King began to decline in health after suffering a stroke in August 2005. She also was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The four children of the civil rights activist noticed \\"something was happening\\". King was having a conversation with her mother in her home when she stopped talking. Coretta Scott King had a blood clot move from her heart and lodge in an artery in her brain. She was hospitalized on August 16, 2005, and was set to come home as well. Alongside the physician that took care of her mother, Dr. Maggie Mermin and her sister, Yolanda told the press that her mother was making progress on a daily basis and was expected to make a full recovery. She became a spokesman for the American Heart Association after her mother's stroke, promoting a campaign to raise awareness about strokes. That year, she and her brother Dexter came to oppose their other brother and sister, Martin Luther King III and Bernice King, on the matter of selling the King Center. King and Dexter were in favor of sale, but their other siblings were not. After Coretta Scott King died on January 30 of the next year, Yolanda, like her siblings, attended her funeral. When asked about how she was faring following the death of her mother, Yolanda responded: \\"I connected with her spirit so strongly. I am in direct contact with her spirit, and that has given me so much peace and so much strength.\\" She found her mother's personal papers in her home. She preached in January 2007 to an audience in Ebenezer Baptist Church to be an oasis for peace and love, as well as to use her father's holiday as starting ground for their own interpretations of prejudice. She spoke on Martin Luther King Jr. Day 2007 to attendants at the Ebenezer Baptist Church and stated: \\"We must keep reaching across the table and, in the tradition of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, feed each other,\\". After her hour-long presentation, she joined her sister and her aunt, Christine King Farris, in signing books. On May 12, 2007, days before her death, she spoke at St. Mary Medical Center, on the part of the American Stroke Association. It would be the last time she would speak on behalf of the association. Death On May 15, 2007, King stated to her brother Dexter that she was tired, though he thought nothing of it due to her \\"hectic\\" schedule. Around an hour later, King collapsed in the Santa Monica, California home of Philip Madison Jones, her brother Dexter King's best friend, and could not be revived. Her death came a year after her mother died. Her family has speculated that her death was caused by a heart condition. In the early hours of May 19, 2007, King's body was brought to Atlanta, Georgia by private plane belonging to Bishop Eddie Long. A public memorial for Yolanda King was held on May 24, 2007, at Ebenezer Baptist Church Horizon Sanctuary in Atlanta, Georgia. Many in attendance did not know her, but came out of respect for the King family's history of non-violence and social justice. King was cremated,\\"Yolanda King Dead At Age 51\\", CBS News. in accordance with her wishes. She was 51. All three of her siblings lit a candle in her memory. Bernice King said it was \\"very difficult standing here blessed as her one and only sister. Yolanda, from your one and only, I thank you for being a sister and for being a friend.\\" Martin Luther King III uttered that \\"Yolanda is still in business. She just moved upstairs.\\" Maya Angelou wrote a tribute to her, which was read during the memorial service. She wrote \\"Yolanda proved daily that it was possible to smile while wreathed in sadness. In fact, she proved that the smile was more powerful and sweeter because it had to press itself through mournfulness to be seen, force itself through cruelty to show that the light of survival shines for us all.\\" Many former classmates of both Grady High School and Smith College attended to remember her. Raphael Warnock stated; \\"She dealt with the difficulty of personal pain and public responsibility and yet ... she emerged from it all victorious. Thank you for her voice.\\" Ideas, influence, and political stances To the time of her death, King continued to express denial in her father's dreams and ideals being fulfilled during her lifetime. In 1993, she debunked any thought that her father's \\"dream\\" had been anything but a dream, and was quoted as saying \\"It's easier to build monuments than to make a better world. It seems we've stood still and in many ways gone backward since Martin Luther King Jr. was alive.\\", during a celebration that marked what would have been her father's sixty-fourth birthday. Despite this, she was quoted in January 2003 of saying that she was \\"a 100 percent, dyed-in-the-wool, card-carrying believer in 'The Dream'. It's a dream about freedom—freedom from oppression, from exploitation, from poverty ... the dream of a nation and a world where each and every child will have the opportunity to simply be the very best that they can be.\\" The statement was made while she was in the presence of 800 people who gathered to honor her father at the Everett Theatre. She made it clear that month that she was not trying to fill her father's footsteps, noting jokingly that \\"They're too big\\" and that she would \\"fall and break [her] neck\\". She also advocated for her father's holiday to be used as a day for helping others, and also expressed dissatisfaction on the basis of people relaxing on his day. On January 15, 1997, she spoke at Florida Memorial College and expressed what she believed her father would feel if \\"he knew that people were taking a day off in his memory to do nothing\\". She disliked cliches used to define her father and expressed this to Attallah Shabazz, and recalled having seen a play where her father was a \\"wimp\\" and carried The Bible with him everywhere.Marable, p.133. King was an ardent activist for gay rights, as was her mother, Coretta. King protested many times over gay rights. She was among 187 people arrested during a demonstration by lesbian and gay rights activists. She stated at the Chicago's Out and Equal Workplace Summit in 2006 \\"If you are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, you do not have the same rights as other Americans, you cannot marry, ... you still face discrimination in the workplace, and in our armed forces. For a nation that prides itself on liberty, justice and equality for all, this is totally unacceptable. Like her parents and siblings, King did not outright go and make any affiliation with a political party publicly. Despite this, she did voice opposition to President Ronald Reagan in his reluctance to sign Martin Luther King Jr. Day, her father's national holiday. Legacy Dexter King said of his sister, \\"She gave me permission. She allowed me to give myself permission to be me.\\" Jesse Jackson stated that King \\"lived with a lot of the trauma of our struggle. The movement was in her DNA.\\" Joseph Lowery stated; \\"She was a princess and she walked and carried herself like a princess. She was a reserved and quiet person who loved acting.\\" January 2008's issue of Ebony, her relationship with Rev. Suzan Johnson Cook was highlighted in an article written by the minister, as she dubbed her deceased longtime friend a \\"queen whose name was King\\". On May 25, 2008, her brother Martin Luther III and his wife, Arndrea, became the parents of a baby girl and named her Yolanda Renee King, after his late sister. During a 2009 reunion at her alma mater Smith College, a walk was done in her memory by fellow alumni. =Portrayals in film= Yolanda has mostly been portrayed in films that revolve around her parents. * Felecia Hunter, in the 1978 television miniseries King. * Melina Nzeza as a child and Ronda Louis-Jeune as an adult, in the 2013 television movie Betty and Coretta.

It is found in the Atlantic Forest, especially with Araucaria angustifolia, in south-eastern Brazil (São Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul), far eastern Paraguay and far north-eastern Argentina. It is the state bird of Paraná.  Description  The azure jay has a total length of approximately and it weighs about , and is the largest South American corvid. Its plumage is intensely blue with a contrasting black head and upper chest. Males and females are similar, although the females typically are smaller. Its breeding season is from October to January. This bird is a social breeder. It lays 2–4 eggs and its nest is made of sticks. It is placed above the ground in an Araucaria tree.  Diet  It feeds extensively on the nut-like seeds of Araucaria angustifolia, but it is not strictly limited to this since it also feeds on insects and fruit. As other corvids, azure jays are highly intelligent. Their communication is complex, consisting of at least 14 distinct vocalizations. They form groups of 4 to 15 individuals that are well organized in hierarchies. These groups remain stable for up to two generations. Folklore and culture It is said that a black crow was on an araucaria tree, when it was scared by the sound of a man trying to take down the tree with an axe. Saddened by the destruction of its home, the crow flew to the sky, when it heard a voice saying that it would be painted with the color of the sky, and be guardian of the trees. And as a guardian of the araucaria trees, even guns would deny fire towards it. This folklore is based mostly on the habit this bird has to bury araucaria seeds to consume later, helping the spread of the tree across the region, and being considered the greater disseminator of the species. But above that, it shows the importance the araucaria tree, and the azure jay have to the people of Parana. It is the official symbol of the state (State Law n. 7957 of 1984), it gives name to the highest pize in theatrical arts of Parana (Azure Jay Trophy), and is the symbol of the soccer team Parana Clube. It also inspired the comicbook superhero O Gralha (the Jay/The Crow), a superhero created by artists of Curitiba.

The adjectival form is \\"akratic\\".Although this philosopher's technical term is usually employed in its Greek form (i.e., akrasia/akratic) in English texts, it was once the philosophers' English language convention to use the precise English equivalent of akrasia/akratic, incontinence/incontinent. However, it now seems that the correct, widely established convention is to use the term akrasia. Classical approaches Portrait in marble of Socrates, who was an early investigator of akrasia The problem goes back at least as far as Plato. In Plato's Protagoras Socrates asks precisely how it is possible that, if one judges action A to be the best course of action, one would do anything other than A? In the dialogue Protagoras, Socrates attests that akrasia does not exist, claiming \\"No one goes willingly toward the bad\\" (358d). If a person examines a situation and decides to act in the way he determines to be best, he will pursue this action, as the best course is also the good course, i.e. man's natural goal. An all-things-considered assessment of the situation will bring full knowledge of a decision's outcome and worth linked to well- developed principles of the good. A person, according to Socrates, never chooses to act poorly or against his better judgment; and, therefore, actions that go against what is best are simply a product of being ignorant of facts or knowledge of what is best or good. Aristotle, on the other hand, took a more empirical approach to the question, acknowledging that we intuitively believe in akrasia. He distances himself from the Socratic position by locating the breakdown of reasoning in an agent’s opinion, not his appetition. Now, without recourse to appetitive desires, Aristotle reasons that akrasia occurs as a result of opinion. Opinion is formulated mentally in a way that may or may not imitate truth, while appetites are merely desires of the body. Thus, opinion is only incidentally aligned with or opposed to the good, making an akratic action the product of opinion instead of reason. For Aristotle, the antonym of akrasia is enkrateia, which means \\"in power\\" (over oneself). The word akrasia occurs twice in the Koine Greek New Testament. In Jesus uses it to describe hypocritical religious leaders, translated \\"self-indulgence\\" in several translations, including the English Standard version. Paul the Apostle also gives the threat of temptation through akrasia as a reason for a husband and wife to not deprive each other of sex (). In another passage (Rom. 7:15–25) Paul, without actually using the term akrasia, seems to reference the same psychological phenomenon in discussing the internal conflict between, on the one hand, \\"the law of God,\\" which he equates with \\"the law of my mind\\"; and \\"another law in my members,\\" identified with \\"the flesh, the law of sin.\\" \\"For the good that I would do, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.\\" (v.19) In Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, book II, Acrasia, the embodiment of intemperance dwelling in the \\"Bower of Bliss\\", had the Circe- like capacity of transforming her lovers into monstrous animal shapes. Contemporary approaches Donald Davidson (1969–1980) attempted to solve the problem by first criticizing earlier thinkers who wanted to limit the scope of akrasia to agents who despite having reached a rational decision were somehow swerved off their \\"desired\\" tracks. Indeed, Davidson expands akrasia to include any judgment that is reached but not fulfilled, whether it be as a result of an opinion, a real or imagined good, or a moral belief. \\"[T]he puzzle I shall discuss depends only on the attitude or belief of the agent...my subject concerns evaluative judgments, whether they are analyzed cognitively, prescriptively, or otherwise.\\" Thus, he expands akrasia to include cases in which the agent seeks to fulfill desires, for example, but ends up denying himself the pleasure he has deemed most choice-worthy. Davidson sees the problem as one of reconciling the following apparently inconsistent triad: * If an agent believes A to be better than B, then they want to do A more than B. * If an agent wants to do A more than B, then they will do A rather than B if they only do one. * Sometimes an agent acts against their better judgment. Davidson solves the problem by saying that, when people act in this way, they temporarily believe that the worse course of action is better, because they have not made an all-things-considered judgment, but only a judgment based on a subset of possible considerations. Another contemporary philosopher, Amélie Rorty (1980) has tackled the problem by distilling out akrasia's many forms. She contends that akrasia is manifested in different stages of the practical reasoning process. She enumerates four types of akrasia: akrasia of direction or aim, of interpretation, of irrationality, and of character. She separates the practical reasoning process into four steps, showing the breakdown that may occur between each step and how each constitutes an akratic state. Another explanation is that there are different forms of motivation which can conflict with each other. Throughout the ages, many have identified a conflict between reason and emotion, which might make it possible to believe that one should do A rather than B, but still end up wanting to do B more than A. Psychologist George Ainslie argues that akrasia results from the empirically verified phenomenon of hyperbolic discounting, which causes us to make different judgements close to a reward than we will when further from it. Weakness of will Richard Holton (1999), argues that weakness of the will involves revising one's resolutions too easily. Under this view, it is possible to act against one's better judgment (that is, be akratic), but without being weak-willed. Suppose, for example, Sarah judges that taking revenge upon a murderer is not the best course of action, but makes the resolution to take revenge anyway and sticks to that resolution. According to Holton, Sarah behaves akratically but does not show weakness of will. See alsoNotes References       reprinted in           *  External links  * \\"Akrasia\\" by Seth J.

Pereiaslav, Ukraine. A rushnyk or rushnik (, , , ) is a ritual cloth embroidered with symbols and cryptograms of the ancient world.A Language of Their Own Rushnyky are mirrors of a nation's cultural ancestral memory. The ritual ornaments on rushnyky preserved archaic magical signs, symbolism of colors and artistic folk styles, Kozak baroque and rococo as well as classicism, all of which continue to amaze us and are cherished to this day. They have a language of their own — cryptograms that have been forgotten but not lost. They have been used in sacred Eastern Slavic rituals, religious services and ceremonial events such as weddings and funerals. Each region has its own designs and patterns with hidden meaning, passed down from generation to generation and studied by ethnographers. There are many rushnyk collections in ethnographic museums. In Ukraine, the Rushnyk Museum is located in Pereiaslav, Ukraine as part of The Museum of Folk Architecture and Way of Life of Central Naddnipryanshchyna. A Russian rushnyk collection is housed at the Hermitage Museum.  Meaning  Belgorod rushniks, Central Russia The rectangular shape of the fabric indicates a life's journey and the ornamentation captures the cultural ancestral memory of the region. The material used is either linen or hemp. The act of spinning thread and the process of weaving linen embodies spiritual power dating back to the ancient deity Mokosh who is often represented in embroidery. The needle has its own energy, an idea similar to acupuncture, and the color of the thread has sacred meaning. Red represents life and is the main color used. A rushnyk is given to a baby at birth, it follows the person throughout life and used in the funeral service after death. Rushniks play in Russia an important part in the Eastern Orthodox Church. It used to be very common to decorate the icons with Ruhsniks, this tradition is still common.  Uses  Ručnik pattern on the flag of Belarus A Rushnyk has many uses. The very basic rushnik is colloquially called the utyralnyk or wiper and serves as a towel. The utyralnyk either has no designs on it or it has very narrow strip on the edges. In contrast, a nabozhnyk is a highly decorated Rushnyk composing of embroidery and of lace. Nabozhnyks, also called nabraznyks or nakutnyks are used to decorate icons and icon corners in homes.  Wedding rushnyks and motifs  Rushnyk Colour plays a very important symbolic role in traditional Slavic embroidery. Red is the colour of life, the sun, fertility and health. The majority of rushnyks are embroidered with red threads. The very word \\"red\\" means \\"beautiful\\" and \\"splendid\\" in Old Russian and Ruthenian: a red girl, a red sun or a red spring. The phrase Krasnaya devitsa in Old Russian language for example is an old idiomatic expression which means beautiful girl, the word Krasnaya translates in Russian language also into red. The diamond-shaped design of the rushnyk is an ancient agricultural symbol, which means a sown field, or the sun, and expresses the idea of fertility and protection against evil. Ducks, in the centre of the rushnyk, symbolize the element of life- giving water. In wedding folklore a duck and a drake symbolize a bride and a groom, in other words a pair of ducks is a symbol of family life. Another common symbol on rushniks are birds. During a wedding ceremony, the bride and groom are standing on a Rushnyk called a pidnozhnyk, which translates as step- on towel. What happens to the pidnozhnyk is that the bride will drag the towel behind her, and her bridesmaids follow behind her. Tradition has it that when the bridesmaids follow behind the pidnozhnyk, they are following the path of the bride and will hopefully be married.

It depicted suited men seated around a table, under an Eye of Providence, playing a Monopoly-like board game that rested on the backs of bent over naked figures, with a background of industry and protest. A local councillor likened it to antisemitic propaganda in pre-war Germany, referencing what he saw as its stereotypical depictions of Jews, together with its reference to finance and the monetary and Masonic associations of the Eye of Providence. Mear One said that those portrayed comprised both Jews and non- Jews and denied any antisemitic intent, and that his work raised questions of class. Amid allegations of antisemitism in the UK Labour Party in 2018, the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was criticised for a social media comment made while he was a backbencher, which asked why the mural was being threatened with removal.

It is best known for its association with Hammer Film Productions.  History  Down Place = Down Place, a large Thamesside house in the Berkshire hamlet of Water Oakley, was built in the 1750s for Richard Tonson, the Member of Parliament for Windsor and relative of publisher Jacob Tonson. After Tonson's death in 1772, the house was owned by the Dukes of Argyll and subsequently by John Barker Church. A later owner, Mr Hudleston, sold the property to Henry Harford in around 1807. The Harford family continued to occupy the house at the time of the 1901 census. At some point after this, the house was vacated except for the west wing where the Davies family resided. Subsequently, the main building largely fell into dereliction. = Hammer Film Productions (1951–1970) = In 1951, Hammer Film Productions bought Down Place, a location they had used in 1950 to film The Dark Light. The premises were largely derelict, and Hammer used the building's interior for filming before constructing a sound stage on the estate in 1952. The first full production at the studios was the 1951 film Cloudburst. In 1959, Columbia Pictures bought a 49% share in the studios worth £300,000 (£ in 2019); the agreement saw a co-production deal whereby Columbia would produce five films a year at the studios. As this five-year agreement ended, Hammer founder James Carreras sold shares in the company to Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC). This deal, made in 1963, saw Hammer obligated to move their production to Elstree Studios. At this time, the studio complex of Bray consisted of four sound stages ranging from to ; one of the stages contained a water tank. Other facilities included a stills department, dressing rooms, set design and construction departments, production offices and administration departments. Audio recordings suffered as a result of the studios being within the flight path of Heathrow Airport. The final Hammer film produced in full at Bray was 1966's The Mummy's Shroud; by November 1966 the move to Elstree was complete. In 1968, the last member of the Davies family left the house and the wing was converted into luxury flats. At the suggestion of EMI, as ABPC had become, Hammer sought to sell Bray Studios. Initially valued at £250,000 (£ in 2019), Hammer sold the site in November 1970 for approximately £70,000 (£ in 2019). = Post-Hammer (1970–2014) = Following their purchase, the premises were renamed the Bray International Film Centre and a fifth sound stage was constructed. Production continued at Bray, including special effects for series such as Doctor Who and Space 1999. In 1984, Redspring sold the complex to the Samuelson Group for £700,000 (£ in 2019). Samuelson provided the complex with a £2,000,000 (£ in 2019) investment before selling the site to a property development company who planned to demolish the sound stages and convert Down Place into office buildings. In 1991, television producer Neville Hendricks bought the complex and allowed film production to continue. The soundstages at Bray stayed busy through the 2000's as rehearsal stages for music tours incl. Pink Floyd, Roger Waters ( at the same time!), Elton John, The Who and others. = Sale and demolition (2014–present) = In 2014, Hendricks announce his intention to sell the site, explaining that it was not economically viable citing competition from the studios at Pinewood and Shepperton, as well as Bray's location in a green belt. He sold the complex to a property development company who submitted a planning application in 2015 for luxury apartments and demolition of the sound stage buildings; demolition began in 2017.

It also serves the immediate area of the Subic Bay Freeport Zone, the provinces of Bataan and Zambales, and the general area of Olongapo in the Philippines. The airport was as the Naval Air Station Cubi Point, part of the Subic Naval Base of the United States Navy, before the base closed. History In 1950, Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, envisioned an naval base in the Western Pacific to enhance Seventh Fleet capabilities. The Korean War began and the Navy realized it had a need for an air station in the region. Cubi Point in the Philippines was selected, and civilian contractors were initially approached for the project. After seeing the Zambales Mountains and the surrounding jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The U.S. Navy then turned to the Seabees and was told no problem, Can do. The first Seabees to arrive were surveyors of Construction Battalion Detachment 1802. Moblie Comstruction Battalion 3 arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 also contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the Panama Canal. Seabees there moved of dry fill plus another 15 million that was hydraulic fill. The $100 million-facility (equivalent to $ million in ) was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station with an adjacent pier capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. After decades of use by American forces, Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, burying Cubi Point in of ash. Despite this, the American government wished to keep the Subic Naval Base and signed a treaty with the Philippine government. The treaty was not ratified, however, failing by a slim margin in the Philippine Senate. Attempts to negotiate a new treaty were soon abandoned and the United States was informed that it was to withdraw within one year. U.S. forces withdrew in November 1992, turning over the facility with its airport to the Philippine government. Initially some 8,000 volunteers guarded the facility and prevented looters from damaging the facilities. The Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) was created to manage the facility by virtue of Republic Act No. 7227 after intense lobbying of then-Mayor Richard Gordon. He was appointed its first Chairman and Administrator. Twenty days after the departure of American forces, the airport ushered in its first commercial flight from Taiwan via Makung. In February 1993, NAS Cubi Point was converted to Cubi Point International Airport. To herald its designation as an international airport, President Fidel V. Ramos chose to arrive in November 1993 from an official visit to the United States using the airport. This flight also proved the capabilities of the airport as the President arrived aboard the delivery flight of Philippine Airlines's first Boeing 747-400. Construction of the present runway by Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction Philippines began in 1993 and was completed in April 1995, in time for the inaugural landing of FedEx Express MD-11 and the formal opening of FedEx's AsiaOne hub. The newly renamed Subic Bay International Airport was formally opened on 30 September 1996. The new 12.6-million passenger terminal built by Summa Kumagai Inc. (a joint Filipino- Japanese venture) was inaugurated on 4 November 1996, in time for the 4th APEC Leaders' Summit. Between 1992 and 1995 SBIA welcomed a total of around 100,000 commercial passengers. The airport was expected to handle 110,000 passengers in 1996. In 1997, SBIA topped the 100,000 annual passenger count. For the year 1998, the airport handled a total of around 1,000 international and 6,000 domestic flights, and almost 100,000 inbound and outbound passengers. By 2007 the number of recorded passengers had dropped to 17,648, but due to the presence of the FedEx AsiaOne Hub the airport still handled 115,108 flights. The FedEx hub lasted until February 2009, when all operations were moved to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in Guangzhou, China. Due to this departure, as well as the planned expansion of nearby Clark International Airport, Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority Administrator and CEO Armand C. Arreza expressed interest in closing Subic Bay International Airport in favor of converting the area to a logistics hub in January 2010. In December 2010, Guam-based Aviation Concepts Inc. set up fixed-based operations at the airport, refurbishing a hangar to international standards, with the aim of eventually establishing a full-service aviation center. In 2016, the airport began to once again be used for daily commercial passenger flights, with Air Juan flying their nine-seater amphibious aircraft to and from their private seaplane base in Manila South Harbor, located north of the CCP Complex. In 2018, Razon Group acquired Aviation Concepts Technical Services, Inc. (ACTSI) and signed a 25-year lease agreement (as well as a 25-year option) with the local government that will see the airport transformed into a regional business aviation hub, with a fifty plus years potential. The company is refurbishing its facility and targeting to its premiere upgrade in the third quarter of 2019. Airport facilities Subic Bay International Airport boasts of modern facilities, which include the following: *10,000-square metre passenger terminal, with 2 gates *2 stearn jetways *Closed-circuit television (CCTV) *9000 foot runway *Military Ramp (Southwest Ramp) being used by the US Armed forces as a part of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between the Philippines and the United States.

She was named after the 17th century Swedish admiral Clas Fleming. Commissioned in 1914, Clas Fleming was among the first Swedish warships to use Parsons steam turbines. As built it was armed with four guns in a superfiring arrangement: one at the forecastle, one - highly unusually - on top of its armoured conning tower, one on the poop deck, and a fourth at the stern. Up to 190 naval mines could be carried on the main deck. In service the stern was found to be very wet on rough seas, so in 1918-19 the poop deck was extended to the stern; the guns at the stern and on the conning tower were accordingly moved to a more old-fashioned, side-by-side positions just aft of amidships. In 1926 three anti-aircraft guns were added, one on the conning tower and two just behind the amidships 120mm guns. In November 1939 Clas Fleming was extended with a long new section to make room for four new six- cylinder two-stroke diesel engines; these however did not drive the propeller shafts directly, but were gas generators for the turbines, a rare arrangement never before used on a ship. Of the eight original coal-fired boilers only two were retained, and these were modified to oil firing. After World War II Clas Fleming was placed in reserve in Stockholm, and was decommissioned on 1 January 1959.

The main live game will typically kick off at 4:30 pm, often following a 2:00 pm game, on the Sky Sports Premier League channel. It had been presented since its debut in August 1992 by former TV-am host Richard Keys alongside a variety of guest match pundits until January 2011. From the 2005–06 season, former Liverpool player Jamie Redknapp joined Keys as a regular pundit. The commentary team of Martin Tyler and former Scotland striker Andy Gray became synonymous with Sky's football coverage until Gray was sacked in January 2011 although other commentators may be used. In April 2011, former Manchester United defender Gary Neville was confirmed as his replacement. Innovation The first match shown on Super Sunday was between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool on 16 August 1992, a match Forest won 1-0. This first broadcast featured a digital on-screen graphic (DOG) throughout the game showing the score and match time. It was the first time a UK broadcaster had done such a thing and DOGs are now part of coverage of virtually all televised sports worldwide. Broadcast times In the first four seasons of the programme, Ford Super Sunday – the title due to major sponsorship with the Ford Motor Company – used to start at 2:00 pm, giving viewers two hours build-up before the slightly untraditional kick-off time of 4:00 pm, as opposed to a Saturday kick-off at 3:00 pm. Eventually, Sky decided this was a bit too much, and in 1996 decided to start the programme at 3:00 pm instead. From the 2004–05 season, some Super Sunday coverage started as early as 1:00 pm if two live games were shown that day. From the 2005–06, coverage began at 3:30 pm if only one live game was shown. Sometimes, three live games are shown on Super Sunday, with the games kicking off at 12:00 pm, 2:15 pm and 4:30 pm respectively. This can happen because of one of two reasons, either Sky selecting three matches for live broadcasting on a Sunday during the three time slots or the Saturday 12.30 pm game being rescheduled for Sunday at 12:00 pm due to the team featured playing in the UEFA Europa League the preceding Thursday night. Sunday noon kick-offs are sometimes broadcast on BT Sport instead. Sky advertise Super Sunday as showing the Premier League's biggest match of the weekend, but, although they have first pick of live Premier League games on most weekends, there are numerous restrictions which mean the best game does not necessarily kick off at 4:30 pm, or is even broadcast on Sky. Police restrictions mean many derby matches must kick off earlier while there are restrictions on the number of times Sky can show each team per season. Additionally, Sky can not move a game to take place on Super Sunday if one of the teams involved is playing in the UEFA Champions League the following Tuesday, in order to give the team time to recover. As Sky are also the broadcasters of the EFL Cup, the final takes centre stage on the network on a Sunday midafternoon in late February/early March, which would otherwise clash with a 4 pm Premier League kick-off on that day. Presentation Richard Keys had hosted the programme from one of the grounds alongside Jamie Redknapp and at least one more guest. The panel often introduce the first game with an empty stadium behind them because of the staggered kick-off times. This was until 27 January 2011 when Keys resigned from Sky Sports following allegations of sexist remarks and unacceptable behaviour in the workplace. Martin Tyler and Andy Gray have been the most regular commentators on Super Sunday, appearing either as a team or split over two matches. When there were two matches, Gray would commentate on the main match and act as a studio pundit for the other game as well as appearing on The Last Word discussion programme alongside Keys immediately after Super Sunday on Sky Sports 1. However, following sexist comments towards assistant referee Sian Massey in a conversation prior to a match between Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. and Liverpool on Saturday, 22 January, Gray was sacked by Sky and soon after Richard Keys handed in his resignation. Keys said: Keys was permanently replaced by Ed Chamberlin for the 2011-12 season, after Sky were impressed by his presenting on the Survival Sunday coverage at the end of the 2010-11 season.

Each player may take on (or even encounter) only some of the challenges possible, and the same challenges may be played in a different order. Conversely, a video game with linear gameplay will confront a player with a fixed sequence of challenges: every player faces every challenge and has to overcome them in the same order. A nonlinear game will allow greater player freedom than a linear game. For example, a nonlinear game may permit multiple sequences to finish the game, a choice between paths to victory, different types of victory, or optional side- quests and subplots. Some games feature both linear and nonlinear elements, and some games offer a sandbox mode that allows players to explore an open world game environment independently from the game's main objectives, if any objectives are provided at all. A game that is significantly nonlinear is sometimes described as being open-ended or a sandbox, though that term is used incorrectly in those cases, and is characterized by there being no \\"right way\\" of playing the game. Whether intentional or not, a common consequence of open- ended gameplay is emergent gameplay. ClassificationBranching storylines= Games that employ linear stories are those where the player cannot change the story line or ending of the story. Many video games use a linear structure, thus making them more similar to other fiction. However, it is common for such games to use interactive narration in which a player needs to interact with something before the plot will advance, or nonlinear narratives in which events are portrayed in a non-chronological order. Many games have offered premature endings should the player fail to meet an objective, but these are usually just interruptions in a player's progress rather than actual endings. Even in games with a linear story, players interact with the game world by performing a variety of actions along the way. More recently, some games have begun offering multiple endings to increase the dramatic effect of moral choices within the game, although early examples also exist. Still, some games have gone beyond small choices or special endings, offering a branching storyline, known as an interactive narrative, that players may control at critical points in the game. Sometimes the player is given a choice of which branch of the plot to follow, while sometimes the path will be based on the player's success or failure at a specific challenge. For example, Black Isle Studios' Fallout series of role-playing video games features numerous quests where player actions dictate the outcome of the story behind the objectives. Players can eliminate in-game characters permanently from the virtual world should they choose to do so, and by doing so may actually alter the number and type of quests that become available to them as the game progresses. The effects of such decisions may not be immediate. Branches of the story may merge or split at different points in the game, but seldom allow backtracking. Some games even allow for different starting points, and one way this is done is through a character selection screen. Despite experimenting with several nonlinear storytelling mechanisms in the 1990s, the game industry has largely returned to the practice of linear storytelling. Linear stories cost less time and money to develop, since there is only one fixed sequence of events and no major decisions to keep track of. For example, several games from the Wing Commander series offered a branching storyline, but eventually they were abandoned as too expensive. Nonlinear stories increase the chances for bugs or absurdities if they are not tested properly, although they do provide greater player freedom. Some players have also responded negatively to branching stories because it is hard and tedious for them to experience the \\"full value\\" of all the game's content. As a compromise between linear and branching stories, there are also games where stories split into branches and then fold back into a single storyline. In these stories, the plot will branch, but then converge upon some inevitable event, giving the impression of a Nonlinear gameplay through the use of nonlinear narrative, without the use of interactive narratives. This is typically used in many graphic adventure games. A truly nonlinear story would be written entirely by the actions of the player, and thus remains a difficult design challenge. As such, there is often little or no story in video games with a truly nonlinear gameplay. Facade, a video game often categorized as an interactive drama, features many branching paths that are dictated by the user's text input based on the current situation, but there is still a set number of outcomes as a result of the inherent limitations of programming, and as such, is non-linear, but not entirely so. Visual novels Branching storylines are a common trend in visual novels, a subgenre of interactive narrative and adventure games. Visual novels frequently use multiple branching storylines to achieve multiple different endings, allowing non-linear freedom of choice along the way. Decision points within a visual novel often present players with the option of altering the course of events during the game, leading to many different possible outcomes.Dani Cavallaro (2010), Anime and the visual novel: narrative structure, design and play at the crossroads of animation and computer games, pp. 78–9, McFarland & Company, Visual novels are popular in East Asia, especially in Japan where they account for nearly 70% of personal computer games released there. A recent acclaimed example is 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, where nearly every action and dialogue choice can lead to entirely new branching paths and endings. Each path only reveals certain aspects of the overall storyline and it is only after uncovering all the possible different paths and outcomes through multiple playthroughs that everything comes together to form a coherent well- written story.999: 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors Review, IGN, November 16, 2010 It is not uncommon for visual novels to have morality systems. A well-known example is the 2005 title School Days, an animated visual novel that Kotaku describes as going well beyond the usual \\"black and white choice systems\\" (referring to video games such as Mass Effect, Fallout 3 and BioShock) where you \\"pick a side and stick with it\\" while leaving \\"the expansive middle area between unexplored.\\" School Days instead encourages players to explore the grey, neutral middle-ground in order to view the more interesting, \\"bad\\" endings. It is also not uncommon for visual novels to have multiple protagonists giving different perspectives on the story. C's Ware's EVE Burst Error (1995) introduced a unique twist to the system by allowing the player to switch between both protagonists at any time during the game, instead of finishing one protagonist's scenario before playing the other. EVE Burst Error often requires the player to have both protagonists co-operate with each other at various points during the game, with choices in one scenario affecting the other. Fate/stay night is another example that features multiple perspectives. Chunsoft sound novels such as Machi (1998) and 428: Shibuya Scramble (2008) develop this concept further, by allowing the player to alternate between the perspectives of several or more different characters, making choices with one character that have consequences for other characters. 428 in particular features up to 85 different possible endings. Another approach to non-linear storytelling can be seen in Cosmology of Kyoto. The game lacks an overall plot, but it instead presents fragmented narratives and situations in a non- linear manner, as the player character encounters various non-player characters while wandering the city. These narratives are cross-referenced to an encyclopedia, providing background information as the narratives progress and as the player comes across various characters and locations, with various stories, situations and related information appearing at distinct locations.AUUG Conference Proceedings, September 1995, pages 398-399 It provides enough freedom to allow for the player to experiment with the game, such as using it as a resource for their own role-playing game campaign, for example. Role-playing games Branching storylines are also often used in role-playing video games (RPGs) to an extent. An early example, published in 1999, is the fantasy role-playing game Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor, where players have to choose between Light and Dark. While the dark side wants to destroy the world of Enroth, the light side tries to save it. The choice determines which grandmaster levels the player characters can obtain and the quests they have to do in that part of the game. Earlier in the game, the player already has to choose sides in a border conflict between Elves and Humans, or remain neutral. This affects the flag in their Castle Harmondale and a few quests, but not the final outcome. A second example is Obsidian Entertainment's Fallout: New Vegas, where the player's decisions influence whether one of three different factions gain control of the area surrounding post-apocalyptic Las Vegas. These factions include Caesar's Legion, a group of Roman-esque slavers; the New California Republic (NCR), an expansionist military government; and Mr. House, the enigmatic de facto ruler of New Vegas, in command of an army of robots that patrols the city. Each of the three sides aim to control Hoover Dam, which is still operational and supplying the American Southwest with power and clean, non-irradiated water; thus, control of the dam means effective control of the region. A fourth option, siding with a robot named Yes Man and prevailing upon or eliminating the other faction leaders, enables the player to go solo and take over the Hoover Dam for themselves. Another RPG example is tri-Ace's Star Ocean series, where the storyline is not affected by moral alignments like in other role- playing games but, inspired by dating sims, by friendship and relationship points between each of the characters.Brendan Main, Hooking Up in Hyperspace, The Escapist Star Ocean: The Second Story in particular offers as many as 86 different endingsStar Ocean: Till The End Of Time , Gameplanet with hundreds of permutations, setting a benchmark for the number of possible outcomes of a video game. Another unique variation of this system is the Sakura Wars series, which features a real-time branching choice system where, during an event or conversation, the player must choose an action or dialogue choice within a time limit, or not to respond at all within that time; the player's choice, or lack thereof, affects the player character's relationship with other characters and in turn the direction and outcome of the storyline. Later games in the series added several variations, including an action gauge that can be raised up or down depending on the situation, and a gauge that the player can manipulate using the analog stick depending on the situation. A similar type of conversation system later appeared in a more recent action role-playing game also published by Sega, Alpha Protocol. Another unique take on the concept is combining non-linear branching storytelling with the concepts of time travel and parallel universes. Early attempts at such an approach included Squaresoft's Chrono role-playing game series (1995–1999) and ELF's visual novel YU-NO: A girl who chants love at the bound of this world (1996). Radiant Historia takes it further by giving players the freedom to travel backwards and forwards through a timeline to alter the course of history, with each of their choices and actions significantly affect the timeline. The player can return to certain points in history and live through certain events again to make different choices and see different possible outcomes on the timeline. The player can also travel back and forth between two parallel timelines, and can obtain many possible parallel endings.Radiant Historia Has \\"Many\\" Endings, Siliconera The PSP version of Tactics Ogre featured a \\"World\\" system that allows players to revisit key plot points and make different choices to see how the story unfolds differently.Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, GamesRadar, February 15, 2011 Final Fantasy XIII-2 also features a similar non-linear time travel system to Radiant Historia. Level design Doom space trading and combat simulator, Oolite. A game level or world can be linear, nonlinear or interactive. In a linear game, there is only one path that the player must take through the level, however, in games with nonlinear gameplay, players might have to revisit locations or choose from multiple paths to finish the level. As with other game elements, linear level design is not absolute. While a nonlinear level can give the freedom to explore or backtrack, there can be a sequence of challenges that a player must solve to complete the level. If a player must confront the challenges in a fixed order nonlinear games will often give multiple approaches to achieve said objectives. A more linear game requires a player to finish levels in a fixed sequence to win. The ability to skip, repeat, or choose between levels makes this type of game less linear. Super Mario Bros. is an early example of this, where the player had access to warp zones that skipped many levels of the game. In some games, levels can change between linear design and free roaming depending on the objective of the stage. Super Mario 64 is an example where the main stages are free roam, while the levels where Bowser is encountered follow a straight path to the end. =Open worlds and sandbox modes= When a level is sufficiently large and open-ended, it may be described as an open world, or \\"sandbox game\\", though this term is often used incorrectly. Open- world game designs have existed in some form since the 1980s, such as the space trading game Elite, and often make use of procedurally generated environments. In a game with a sandbox mode, a player may turn off or ignore game objectives, or have unlimited access to items. This can open up possibilities that were not intended by the game designer. A sandbox mode is an option in otherwise goal-oriented games and is distinguished from open- ended games that have no objectives, such as SimCity, and Garry's Mod.  Early examples  Early examples (pre-1983) of nonlinear gameplay include: *Colossal Cave Adventure (1976) *Zork (1977/1980) *MUD1 (1978) *Akalabeth (1979) *Star Raiders (1979) *Superman (1979) *Temple of Apshai (1979) *Computer Bismarck (1980) *Flight Simulator (1979/1980) *Mystery House (1980) *The Prisoner (1980) *Rogue (1980) *Adventure (1980) *005 (1981) *Bosconian (1981) *Castle Wolfenstein (1981) *Crush, Crumble and Chomp!

These frogs live in Guyana, Venezuela, Surinam, Brazil and Bolivia. The holotype was discovered at Tukeit Hill, below Kaieteur Falls, Guyana, hence the common English name.  Description  The Tukeit Hill frog is a small frog of variable colouration, either black, with stripes and spots which can be golden or dull yellow, or a dull yellow or golden ventral surface, with black strips and spots. It has a flat body, and small, flat head. It has a single, submandibular vocal sac. The toe pads are enlarged, wider than the fingers, and the tympanum is visible. The Tukeit Hill frog is superficially similar to the tree frogs, but the ends of their phalanges differ in shape.  Taxonomy  Allophryne ruthveni is part of a hitherto (see below) monotypic subfamily of anurans: Allophryninae. The evolutionary relationships of this species have always been controversial. It has been joined to families such as Hylidae, Bufonidae, and Leptodactylidae, but until recently, its closer relatives were unknown. Allophryne is similar in its general shape to tree frogs of the family Hylidae, but differs by having the last phalanges of fingers and toes T-shaped, a character found in glassfrogs, while tree frogs have claw-shaped ones. When herpetologist G. K. Noble examined Allophryne, he suggested it was closely related to glassfrogs, a hypothesis later confirmed by recent phylogenetic studies, which have found Allophryne is the sister taxon of the glassfrog clade Centroleninae.(Austin et al. 2002, Frost et al. 2006). The glassfrogs differ from Allophryne by having much more delicate skulls and by possessing intercalary elements between the last phalanges of fingers, a process on the third metacarpal, and nonexplosive breeding, among other characteristics. Both glassfrogs and the Allophrynidae are closely related to Leptodactylidae. Recently, an undescribed species of frog, which probably belongs to the genus Allophryne, was discovered in Peru . This suggests the genus is actually more widespread and more species await discovery. As A. ruthveni was assumed to be a northwestern Amazonian endemic, the Peruvian frog indicates the Allophrynidae might have been more widespread in prehistoric times, only later on disappearing from most of the Amazon Basin, and are actually a relict group. Alternatively, they might occur in the western Amazonas lowlands and simply have not been found yet, though this seems less likely.  Behaviour  The Tukeit Hill frog is semiarboreal, spending some times low in the trees, 1–3 m high, and some of the time on the ground. They are explosive breeders, taking advantage of small water ponds formed on the forest floor after periods of rain. This frog inhabits sparse forest, and may be restricted to forested areas, avoiding cleared land. References * Austin, J. D.; Lougheed, S. C.; Tanner, K; Chek, A. A.; Bogart, J. P. & Boag, P. T.

The English First Edition () was printed in October, 2004 in Canada and was rated 'M' for mature audiences 18 years and over. The book story consists of four chapters titled \\"Desire\\" (which is the story of the manga), including a special additional episode titled \\"Not That Deviant\\" (epilogue) and two small chapters titled \\"Free Talk\\" were the writer talks about the story and some of the characters in the manga. Plot The story is about Toru, an extremely quiet and shy high school student who has a crush on Ryoji, a popular member of the high school swimming team known for his sexual escapades. Further complicating this matter is that Toru and Ryoji are very close friends, thus forcing Toru to hide his real feelings for Ryoji and pretend to be just one of his good friends, while being torn between his love for Ryoji and the facade he has to keep up when he sees him every day. But all that changes one day when Ryoji makes an indecent proposal to Toru, asking him if he would like to experiment with him sexually, and admitting that he had been aroused by thoughts of him during sexual intercourse with his girlfriend. Toru unhappily accepts, pressured by his feelings for Ryoji, but as time passes Toru becomes even more aggravated as he realizes that his sexual affair with Ryoji was just a fling based on Ryoji's sexual curiosity, and not on actual romantic attraction. Toru is so depressed about the one-sided situation between him and Ryoji that he confides with a close friend named Kashiwazaki about his emotional turmoil. Together, they come up with a plan to discover Ryoji's true intentions by secretly deciding to lie to him about them being in a romantic relationship together. After learning of this, Ryoji becomes very angry and jealous about Toru and Kashiwazaki's alleged relationship, and tries to break them up. The plan apparently has worked, but Toru is now in a serious love triangle between Ryoji and Kashiwazaki when he begins to realize that Kashiwazaki has been in love with him for a very long time. As the story progresses, he begins to understand that he and Ryoji were not the only ones that were hiding their true feelings. Reception Desire sold 6,000 copies between September 2004 and July 2005. It has been described as \\"over-the-top soap opera with plenty of steamy bits\\". It has been praised for not showing a stereotypical seme-uke relationship, and being a \\"damn good story about being a teenager\\". Patricia Beard, writing for Mania.com regarded the manga as better than the novelisation, but still enjoyed the novelisation. Michelle Smith, writing for Pop Culture Shock thought that the non-consensual scenes were worse to read about in the novelisation than in the manga, as it was \\"more clear\\" in showing Toru's pain. The second half of the novelisation is not adapted from the manga, and the boys misunderstand each other and have sex. Smith regarded the novelisation as unexciting. In 2008, Desire won an American Library Association award in the Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults division, under the category \\"Sex Is...\\".

The ship class was among the most modern destroyers in the world just after the end of World War I. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939 she was stationed as part of the Gothenburg Squadron. Wachtmeister was decommissioned in 1947 and was subsequently sold for scrap in 1950. The ship was named after the Swedish noble family Wachtmeister. Design Wachtmeisters hull was made of nitrated steel. Like former Swedish destroyers, the ship had no proper superstructure on the bow, but had only a protective skirt wall for the command bridge, though there was a small superstructure on the stern. The propulsion machinery consisted of four steam boilers which delivered steam to two steam turbines. The machine generated an output of 11,500 horsepower, giving a maximum speed of 34 knots. Each boiler had a separate funnel, which led to the common four stack arrangement of the time. The two steam turbines were of a new type with reduction gears, which meant that the turbine speed could be shifted down to lower the propeller speed, giving the machinery a better efficiency. On delivery, the ship's main artillery consisted of two 7.5 cm guns m/12 that were placed on the front and rear deck. The close-range protection consisted of two 6.5 mm machine guns m/14 that were placed on either side of the command bridge. The torpedo armament consisted of six 45.7 cm torpedo tubes m/14. Four of these stood as in the previous class in two double stands on the main deck. What was new was that two more were placed behind gaps in the front of the hull. History Wachtmeister was built at Lindholm's Gothenburg shipyard and was launched on December 19, 1917. After fitting out and trials she was delivered to the Swedish Navy on October 19, 1918. During an exercise on the evening of June 8, 1922, Wachtmeister was rammed just ahead of the bridge by the destroyer . Three people who were in Vidars forebody were seriously injured, one later died during transport to the hospital. Wachtmeister got a 20-meter long imprint of the hull and three people were thrown into the water, there could soon be rescued. Vidar was towed into Bergkvara while Wachtmeister could reach Karlskrona by herself. Both destroyers were repaired and taken into service the following year. In 1923, Crown Prince Gustav Adolf would be engaged to Louise Mountbatten with the engagement taking place in England. On 28 June, Wachtmeister went from Karlskrona together with her sister ship Wrangel and all three ships in the Sverige class. On July 2 they went to Sheerness, England where the couple visited the ships. A couple of days later, the journey proceeded to Rosyth, Scotland, where they visited the English Atlantic fleet before going back to Sweden. In the mid-1920s, the ship's boilers, which were initially coal-fired, were converted to oil-fired. =World War II= In 1939, the ship was redeployed, when the forward two torpedo tubes were removed and a 25 mm anti- aircraft automatic gun was added. Furthermore, the two machine guns were replaced with an 8 mm anti-aircraft machine gun m/36 that was mounted on the aft bridge and two depth charge positions with 16 depth charges m/24. During the beginning of World War II, Wachtmeister together with her sister ship was part of the Gothenburg Squadron. In the winter of 1940-1941, the ship would receive new boilers, but by late autumn 1943, she was put into material reserve in Stockholm. =Fate= After Wachtmeister was placed in reserve, she never would be reactivated and was released from service on June 13, 1947. In 1950 she was sold for scrap to a company in Karlstad.

History The Salem Monthly traces its origins to a coffee house in downtown Salem, Oregon known as the Coffee House Cafe. Dating back to the mid-1990s, the Coffee House Cafe served as a popular meeting place and hangout for Salem's youth culture. In its later years of operation, the cafe began publishing a newsletter to engage customers in Salem's community and cultural affairs. Inspired by the reaction to the cafe's newsletter, cafe owner A.P. Walther decided to start up a publishing operation for an alternative newspaper in Salem, Oregon. Salem Weekly celebrated 10 years of operation in April 2013.

Dorothy Bussy (née Strachey), ca. 1923 Dorothy Bussy (née Strachey) (24 July 1865 – 1 May 1960) was an English novelist and translator, close to the Bloomsbury Group.  Family background and childhood  Graystone Bird (1862–1943), albumen print/NPG x13111. Lady Strachey and daughters, ca. 1893 (Dorothy is 2nd from left) Dorothy Bussy was a member of the Strachey family, one of ten children of Jane Strachey and the British Empire soldier and administrator Lt-Gen Sir Richard Strachey. Writer and critic Lytton Strachey and the first English translator of Freud, James Strachey, were her brothers. She was educated at the Marie Souvestre girls' school at Les Ruches, Fontainebleau, France and later in England when Souvestre removed the school to Allenswood there. She was later a teacher with Souvestre, and one of her pupils was Eleanor Roosevelt.  Personal life  The sons and daughters of Sir Richard Strachey and Lady Macdonald. Dorothea is the second from the left. In 1903, Dorothy (37) married the French painter Simon Bussy (1870–1954), who knew Matisse, and was on the fringes of the Bloomsbury circle. He was five years younger, and the son of a shoemaker from the Jura town of Dole. Lady Strachey’s liberalism faltered at the sight of him actually cleaning up his plate with pieces of bread. The family drama \\"shook the regime of Lancaster Gate to its foundations\\" (Holroyd), and, despite the silent disapprobation of the older Stracheys, Dorothy remained determined to marry him with what her brother Lytton later called \\"extraordinary courage\\". Dorothy was bisexual and was involved in an affair with Lady Ottoline Morrell. She became friends with Charles Mauron, the lover of E.M. Forster.  Writing  Bussy anonymously published one novel, Olivia, in 1949, printed by the Hogarth Press, the publishing house founded by Leonard and Virginia Woolf, in which lesbian loves get entangled in the emotional and sexually charged atmosphere of erotic pedagogy in a girls' school. As well as drawing on her own experiences in the schools of Marie Souvestre, the novel's theme probably owes much to Bussy's viewing of the 1931 German film Mädchen in Uniform, that had been distributed in England before the Second World War. It may also owe something to Colette's novel Claudine at School (1900). Bussy's novel was translated into French and appeared in France with an introduction by Rosamond Lehmann. In 1951, the novel was filmed as Olivia, with the lesbian elements toned down, in France by Jacqueline Audry. A BBC radio dramatisation was broadcast in the 1990s. In 1999, her novel appeared at number 35 on Publishing Triangle's '100 best lesbian and gay novels' list.http://www.publishingtriangle.org/100best.asp Bussy was also a close friend of the French Nobel Prize winning author André Gide, whom she met by chance in the summer of 1918 when she was fifty-two, and with whom she struck up a lively correspondence. She adored him and translated all his works into English. Their long-distance friendship lasted for over thirty years. Their letters are published in Richard Tedeschi's Selected Letters of Andre Gide and Dorothy Bussy, and there is also a three-volume French edition. The originals are preserved in the British Library. Her daughter was the painter Jane Simone Bussy (1906–1960).  Legacy  Olivia Records was a collective founded in 1973 to record and market women's music, named after the heroine of the 1949 novel Olivia by Bussy (the heroine and the novel both being named Olivia.)

The civil parish is formed by the village and the hamlets of Camerton and Ryehill. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 3,392, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 3,106. History Thorngumbald was once a Viking settlement – the official emblem of Thorngumbald is a Viking helmet with wings. The name was first recorded in the Domesday Book as \\"Torn\\", an Old English word meaning 'thorn bush'. The name was still in use in 1228, but by 1260 it had become \\"Thorne\\". In the lay subsidy rolls of Edward 1, 1297, it is given as Thorengumbald. A Baron Gumbaud had settled in the area, adding his name to the original and giving the village its present name. The Gumbaud name was associated with the local Lord of the manor in the 13th century. By the 17th century the village had had different spellings, including Thorgumbaud, Thorngumbold, Thorneygumbald and Gumberthorn. The current name has been in use since then. The Gumbaud family still live in the village. Community The parish church of St Mary is a Grade II listed building. The village also had a Methodist church, built 1904. However the stones of the church were relaid in 1984. The village shopping centre has five shops: a small Boots chemist, a newsagents, family butcher, and a fish and chip shop. One unit is empty and undergoing refurbishment. Elsewhere in the village there are three hairdressing salons, a Chinese takeaway, the Royal Mail public house (demolished early 2017), The New Royal Mail Public house, a restaurant, a Royal Mail post office, a bathroom showroom and a tattoo parlour. Thorngumbald Primary School hosts meetings for local organisations, such as the Brownies and St John Ambulance which provide weekly activities for children and teenagers. The local parish offers courses, such as ICT, for people within the village at the local Village Hall on the main road (A1033). Bowls is also played at the Village Hall along with table tennis. There are also line dancing classes at the Village Institute. The Village Hall and the Parish Councillors organise an annual Scarecrow Trail that takes place throughout the village every summer. People of all ages are involved, with the prize usually a trophy. The village is home to England rugby league international Jon Wilkin and former Hull City player Chris Chilton. Education Thorngumbald Primary School is a local Primary School catering for children aged between 4 and 11. The school is a September 2007 amalgamation of Thorngumbald Infant and Junior Schools, now on a newly built site on Plumtree Road, originally the site used by Thorngumbald Infant School. South Holderness Technology College in the village of Preston is the nearest secondary school. It caters for students from ages 11 to 16, with a Sixth Form College for those from 16 to 18. Thorngumbald is within the school's catchment area and buses provided by the school transport students of all age groups to and from the village in the morning and afternoon. In September 2013, the village briefly gained local attention due to bus pass prices to and from South Holderness School. BBC Look North (East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire) were present throughout the village interviewing students and their parents. The prices currently stand at £540 per bus pass for one academic year to travel to and from the school, provided you live three miles or less away from the school. Since this event, there have been a few minor protests including petitions and some of the students who have to pay for the school bus pass, getting on the public bus service as it is much cheaper. There is a nursery on Grange Road. Transport The village was once served by a railway linking Withernsea and Hull at Ryehill and Burstwick station. It closed in 1964 following the Beeching cuts. Thorngumbald is now served by EYMS daily bus routes linking the village to Withernsea and Hull. Sport The village has its own football club, Thorngumbald Boys Football Club, the teams commonly called the Thorngumbald Tigers. The club held football tournaments every year at the playing fields on Plumtree Road, in which football clubs from around Hull and East Yorkshire competed.

Together with the sister ship , she constituted the Ehrensköld class, which, with its size and speed, was a major step in the Swedish destroyer fleet. Initially, Ehrensköld had pennant number 11, which was later changed to 1. In 1951-1952, the ship was converted to frigate, and then received the pennant number 71. She was decommissioned in 1963 and was sold for scrapping in 1973. Design Ehrensköld was 91.4 meters long and had a maximum displacement of 1,000 tons. The hull was made of nitrated steel with a precipitating stem and so called \\"cruiser stern\\", which meant it was rounded. On the front of the deck was a three-story superstructure that included the bridge, wheelhouse, the medical department and the galley. The machinery consisted of three oil-fired boilers that delivered steam to two steam turbines, which each propelled its propeller. The machine generated 24,000 horsepower, giving a speed of 35 knots. Ehrenskölds main armament was made up of three 12 cm guns, placed on the front deck, between the funnels and on the aft deck. In the stern there was an anti- aircraft bridge with two 40 mm anti-aircraft automatic guns. Furthermore, there were torpedo tubes, depth charge thrower and rack-deployed depth charges. Mines could also be deployed. History Ehrensköld was built by Kockums in Malmö and was launched on 25 September 1926. The ship was named after the admiral . Initially the ship had the whole name but the first name was removed the year after the christening. In the summer of 1929, Ehrensköld escorted together with the sister ship Nordenskjöld the coastal defence ship during a trip to Estonia and Latvia. On board the coastal defence ship was King Gustaf V, and the trip was first to Tallinn and then Riga before the ships returned to Sweden. The following year, the sister ships participated in another international trip. This time, together with the and to the then German city of Swinemünde. The purpose of the trip was to collect the dust from Queen Victoria, who had recently died in Rome. In 1934 Ehrensköld ran aground during a move from Karlskrona to Stockholm, where a large hole was torn up in the bottom of the forebody. By flooding parts of the afterbody and making a powerful reverse maneuver, the ship made it off the shoal and made its way to Stockholm's naval shipyards for repairs. =World War II= In September 1938, when Germany claimed Czechoslovak territories, Ehrensköld, together with , were the only mobilized destroyers in the Swedish Navy. In April 1940, when Germany invaded Denmark and Norway, she was demobilized in Karlskrona and the staff shortage in the navy made it difficult to man the ship. Only after many exercises with new crew could the ship be put into service on 2 September. At the beginning of the World War II, Ehrensköld was part of the Karlskrona Squadron, which was part of the South Coast Naval District. In 1942 she was part of the Coastal Fleet, which was the largest and most powerful unit of the Swedish Navy, and then moved back to Karlskrona Squadron. =After the war= From 1951 to 1952 Ehrensköld was converted to frigate, with the torpedo armament and the aft gun removed and replaced by four 40 mm automatic guns m/36. Furthermore, she was equipped with equipment such as hydrophone and depth charges for anti-submarine warfare. Command center was set up and radar was installed. =Fate= Ehrensköld was decommissioned on 1 April 1963, after which she was as a target ship. In 1973 the ship was sold and scrapped in Ystad.

The name comes from Magni, the son of Thor in Nordic mythology. Design Magne was 78 meters long, 8.1 meters wide and had a depth of 2.3 meters. The default deployment was 635 tons and the maximum displacement was 785 tons. The machinery consisted of two Penhoët A oil-fired boilers, which supplied steam to two steam turbines which propelled their propellers. The machine developed 16,000 horsepower, which gave the ship a maximum speed of 30 knots (55 km/h). The main armament consisted of three 10.5 cm guns m/42. These were placed in separate towers, one on the back deck, one on the aft deck and one on the aft superstructure. The air defense was consisted of two 40 mm anti-aircraft automatic guns m/36 and two 20 mm anti-aircraft automatic guns m/40. Three torpedo tubes for 53 cm torpedoes sitting in a triple set of the aft superstructure and further were two depth charge thrower and two rack- deployed depth charges. 42 mines could also be carried for mining. History Magne was built at Götaverken in Gothenburg and was launched on 25 April 1942 and was delivered to the Swedish Navy already on 26 November that year. After delivery, Magne entered the Coastal Fleet, where she served during the rest of World War II. In 1953 Magne was reclassified to frigate and was rebuilt in the mid-1950s.

A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Church posted a 36–37 record, with 274 strikeouts, and a 3.37 earned run average (ERA), in innings pitched, over the course of his six- season big league career. Baseball career During his rookie season, Church was playing a key role for the famed 1950 \\"Whiz Kids\\" Phillies in their fight for a pennant. He was an important member of a very young pitching staff, teaming with Robin Roberts, Curt Simmons, Bob Miller, and the dependable reliever Jim Konstanty. However, Church was struck in the face by a line drive off the bat of Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski. The ball was hit so hard that it caromed into right field on the fly. A week later, he was out on the mound again to face the hard-hitting Dodgers, but after the game his season was over, and he did not play in the 1950 World Series. He finished 1950 at 8–6 with an ERA of 2.73 and two shutouts in 142 innings. Church enjoyed his most productive season in 1951, when he collected career-highs in victories (15), strikeouts (104), shutouts (4) and innings (246), including a one-hitter over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Early in the 1952 season, he was traded to the Reds. Church was 5–9 for Cincinnati, and 7–8 for the Reds and the Chicago Cubs in 1953. Two and a half more seasons with the Cubs, pitching only occasionally because of arm problems, brought his big league career to an end in 1955. Prior to Church's professional baseball career, he served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II serving in the China Burma India Theater.

He was a member of the Irish Volunteers and was born in the Grangemockler area of Co. Tipperary.  Bloody Sunday  Hogan took part in a challenge match between Tipperary and Dublin at Croke Park on Bloody Sunday, November 21, 1920. The day before, he travelled on the train with the other members of the team. A number of the players, including Hogan, became involved in a fight with soldiers from the Lincolnshire Regiment before throwing them from the train. On arrival at (Kingsbridge) Heuston Station, they quickly went their separate ways anticipating arrest. Michael and Thomas Ryan, the two IRA members on the team, decided to stay at Philip Shanahan's pub in Monto that night, rather than Barry's Hotel as planned. There they learned that 'there was a 'big job coming off' the following day, but were unaware of the details. The following morning, Phil Shanahan informed them of the shooting of British agents.

The game stars Drake, an undead assassin who is on a quest to avenge his murdered clan, the 99 Dragons, by recovering their ancient \\"Soul Portal Artifact\\" from antagonist Tang. Tang intends on using the artifact to harvest the souls of dead beings and power his undead cyborg army. Idol FX intended for Drake of the 99 Dragons to be the launchpad for a multimedia franchise, which would include comics and a potential animated television series. However, these plans were scrapped due to the game's negative reception. Gameplay Drake has a number of special moves, such as the abilities to double jump and to run up walls. He also has the ability to slow down time for better accuracy, though this feature could be triggered by accident fairly easily during normal gameplay, which can quickly throw off a player's focus. Drake's health depends primarily on absorbing the souls of his fallen opponents, although there are also red \\"lost souls\\" which deplete Drake's health. As a means of defense, Drake uses a wide arrangement of guns and firearms. The player is able to control two guns by using the left and right triggers. In the Xbox version, an aiming reticle (a common staple of third-person shooters) is excluded; instead, an auto targeting feature is implemented to help Drake aim and fire at the player's enemies. In the PC version, however, an aiming reticle is used. Plot Drake is the premier assassin of a Neo Macau-based clan known as the 99 Dragons. While training in the Kwoon, he hears a break in. He enters the chamber containing the Soul Portal Artifact, given to the clan over 3000 years ago, battling enemies before a mysterious Ghost Assassin swoops out of the room with the artifact. The assassin is in cahoots with Tang, a businessman and the clan's mortal enemy. Drake then pursues the assassin, but is unable to stop the villain when he phases out of a window of the penthouse. He returns to the Master's chamber, only to find the corpses of himself, the Master, and the other members of his clan. Shocked, Drake collapses, and the tattoo on his chest glows. In a flashback, Drake is given the tattoo of the Undying Dragon by The Master, which provides him with supernatural powers as well as immortality. The tattoo glows, and Drake unleashes the abilities to run up walls, slow down time, and freeze time. He explores the penthouse and collects thirty souls of his fallen comrades and enemies. When the powers go to Drake's head, he leaps out a window and falls to his death. He then awakens in the Spirit Realm, and is scolded by the four Spirit Gods. They inform him that he must collect more souls for the Undying Dragon and recover the Soul Portal Artifact in order to avenge his Master's death. They give him a new body and return him to the mortal realm. He pursues a courier and follows his blood trail to a fireworks factory. Drake shoots at him, but is killed in a sudden explosion. The gods, annoyed once more at Drake's lack of competence, bring him back to life and send him to the House of the Dreaming Cloud casino. There, Drake attempts to find the courier, but is attacked by the casino's owner Pok and his demon dogs. After defeating Pok, Drake tails the courier to the Hung Fook Casino Palace, where it turns out he lost the Soul Portal Artifact in a gambling match. A thug beats Chun to near-death for his mishap, but Drake saves his life in time and learns the location of the Soul Portal Artifact. Drake quickly sets off through the city, fending off biker gangs along the way, and returns to the House of the Dreaming Cloud. While fighting Pok, now in his \\"true\\" demonic form, Drake once again gets caught up in an explosion. Serpent-Eye Sung, a business partner and accomplice of Tang, steals the Soul Portal Artifact from a dying Drake and heads off to his canned seafood factory, which they are harvesting the soul from an albino orca. Drake goes to stop Serpent-Eye and take the Artifact back, but is attacked by Tang's henchwoman Banshee and killed once more. The Spirit Gods decide to cut their losses and send Drake back to the penthouse, where the Tang Undertakers are stealing the corpses of the 99 Dragons. Drake chases after a truck holding his master's body, and finds himself taken to a cyborg creation facility. There, he finds that Master has been turned into a cyborg, but manages to defeat the robot and retrieve his Master's body from the remains. Outraged, Drake decides to go after Tang. Upon infiltrating Tang Towers, he discovers Tang's true scheme: to use the artifact to reap the souls from the Spirit Realm and use those souls to power his cyborg army. Drake then breaks into Tang's secret morgue facility and recaptures his clan members' souls. He then travels to the basements of the facility, where Tang is using the artifact to open the portal to the spirit realm. Drake fights and defeats a demon-like creature, but the Ghost Assassin steals the Soul Portal Artifact and escapes into the spirit realm. Drake enters the realm and pursues the assassin, ultimately defeating him. He then retrieves the Soul Portal Artifact and collects the Master's soul. Drake then falls down to a nest of a three-headed beast called the Spirit Lord Supreme, and confronts and defeats it. Drake then goes back to the Serene Garden, and revives the Master with the artifact. Master thanks Drake for his efforts, stating that he achieved a level of proficiency even he was unable to reach, and he has proven himself to the Gods. Reception Drake of the 99 Dragons received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was ranked as the second-worst game for the original Xbox. In July 2006, X-Play called Drake the single worst game ever released for the Xbox, even going so far as to state that it had eclipsed the game Aquaman: Battle for Atlantis as \\"the standard by which they rate all bad games\\". Alex Navarro of GameSpot named it the second worst \\"frightfully bad\\" game of 2003 in Halloween 2004, right behind Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. The game was criticized for its controls, along with frustrating gameplay. The game's dual-wielding system, in which players could control two guns independently by using the trigger buttons to shoot and an analog stick to aim, was notably criticized for having a poorly-implemented targeting system that made it difficult to aim. Frequent criticism centered around its unwieldy camera that often got stuck or prevented the player from seeing the on-screen action, and was mapped to the same analog stick as the aiming reticle. The game was also panned for its poor voice acting, low quality graphics, character animations, and sound design; in particular, GameSpots Navarro felt that the game was a \\"cacophony of terrible effects and voice acting\\"—noticing the re-use of stock sounds notably used in AOL Instant Messenger, and comparing the title character's voice to a cross between a game show host and \\"the Moviefone guy\\". He also felt that, due to the game's \\"disjointed\\" cutscenes and narration, the storyline of the game was nearly incomprehensible. While Aaron Boulding of IGN praised the game's unique visual appearance and presentation, along with the \\"bullet time\\" audio effects whilst slowing down time, he concluded that Drake of the 99 Dragons was \\"a good idea that went horribly astray and ended up disastrous\\" and that \\"there's no need to rent, purchase or entertain the thought of playing this one\\". GameSpots Navarro considered the Xbox version \\"an out-and-out failure in every single discernable category\\".

A unique feature of this design is the angle of the bolt guide rails in relation to the bore axis. When fired, the telescopic bolt, which encloses the barrel for most of its length, recoils up an inclined plane at a 7° angle to the barrel, giving an element of braking to the bolt, and also resisting the upward movement of the barrel during fully automatic fire. This arrangement aligns the shooter's hand wrapping the pistol grip directly with the longitudinal axis of the barrel. The pistol grip is also located higher than on many other submachine guns, causing recoil to be directed backwards to the user rather than upwards, eliminating muzzle climb and making the weapon more controllable when being fired one-handed. =Features= The casing extractor is contained in the bolt while a fixed ejector is installed in the trigger housing. Due to the upward angle that the bolt must traverse in order to fire, the weapon has no feed ramp, so bullets are pushed by the bolt directly from the magazine into the chamber. The weapon's ejection port is covered in both the forward (closed) and retracted positions of the bolt assembly, protecting the gun's internal mechanisms from dust and debris. The left exterior surface of the bolt is engraved with a visual warning sign labeled \\"FIRE\\", which is visible through the ejection port when the weapon is cocked (the bolt is moved to the rear position). The firing mechanism features a two-stage progressive trigger that provides two modes of operation: semi- automatic fire, when the trigger is squeezed momentarily, and fully automatic fire—produced when the trigger is pulled all the way through and held back. No fire control selector is provided. The Jatimatic features a striker firing mechanism with a fixed firing pin installed inside the bolt (the dual-purpose return spring also serves as the firing pin spring). Many of the weapon's parts, including the frame, pistol grip/charging handle, trigger, sear, and disconnector are made of plastic, while many other parts are made of stainless steel; altogether, it has only 39 individual components. The receiver is made from stamped sheet steel with a hinged cover. The Jatimatic lacks an integrated folding stock common for this class of firearm; the weapon is instead fired unsupported from the hip or raised arm, without resting the firearm on the shooter's shoulder. However, separately sold stocks were available which fasten to the lower side of the pistol grip and give it much greater accuracy, while also protecting the rear sight from being bent or broken. =Feeding= The submachine gun uses 20 or 40-round detachable box magazines, made of extruded aluminum with a plastic follower and a steel spring and floor plate. The weapon can also accommodate magazines designed for the Swedish K and, with some modifications, the Smith & Wesson M76. The weapon is chambered for the NATO-standard 9×19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. Reloading the weapon involves charging the folding vertical forward grip, which is simultaneously the cocking handle. The grip is deployed and locked forward with a spring latch and then charged to the rear and guided back forward in order to chamber a round. The forward grip does not reciprocate with the bolt during firing and also acts as a safety mechanism in the stowed (folded) position, immobilizing the bolt in either its forward or rear positions by using a lug on the grip to engage and recess into a notch in the bolt. This allows the weapon to be carried safely either loaded or unloaded and provides a drop safety feature. =Sights= The Jatimatic has an open- type iron sight fixed for 100 m.  History  The gun, designed as a stakeout gun for easy hiding in civilian clothing, soon gained a criminal reputation, when a batch of 22 pieces was stolen from the workshop in 1984. The manufacturing license of the shop, Tampereen Asepaja, was revoked, and no pieces are produced anymore. The firearm can be seen in the 1984 movie Red Dawn, as well as in the 1986 film Cobra, wielded by Sylvester Stallone.http://guns.connect.fi/gow/kysvast39.html It is also used as the primary weapon of DC Comics vigilante Wild Dog.

Arvid Wittenberg or Arvid Wirtenberg von Debern (1606 – 7 September 1657), Swedish count, field marshal and privy councillor. Born in Porvoo, Finland, died in prison in Zamość, Poland, 7 September 1657. Arvid Wittenberg preferred call himself by the original Wittenberg family name, which was Wirtenberg von Debern. Arvid Wittenberg was born on Johannesberg in Porvoo, Finland as a son of the assessor Johannes Wirtenberg von Debern and Magdalena Schönfeld or Magdalena Johansdotter till Skinnarbacka. The title of count was given to Arvid Wittenberg in 1652. He was married twice, with Eva Margareta von Langen from 1642 to her death in 1646 and in 1648 he married Maximiliana Elisabeth von Schönburg. Arvid Wittenberg began his military career in 1622 and participated as a colonel in the Battle of Nördlingen in 1634. He was captured there but later freed. He then participated in the battles of Wittstock 1636 and Chemnitz 1639 before being promoted to major general. He later came under the command of Lennart Torstenson with whom he participated in the rest of the Swedish campaign in the Thirty Years' War until Torstenson resigned in 1645, including the battles of Breitenfeld 1642 and Jankov 1645, in which he on both occasions commanded the Swedish right flank. He then took command of the Swedish army until the arrival of Carl Gustaf Wrangel. As Charles X Gustav prepared for Second Northern War, Wittenberg was promoted to field marshal in 1655 and was assigned command of an army of 17,000 men to attack Poland with. He surrounded the Polish army of nobles and forced it to capitulate at Ujście on 25 July 1655, and conquered the voivodships of Poznań and Kalisz. He besieged Kraków, which capitulated 7 October 1655, and forced the Polish commander Koniecpolski and his army to submission. He was given the command of Warsaw which he defended against the Polish army under John II Casimir of Poland until the city was given up 21 June 1656. Contrary to what had been stated in the terms of capitulation, he was placed in prison in Zamość where he later died. Arvid Wittenberg combined military skills with a hard and cruel treatment of enemies, which made him hated amongst the Poles. In 1657, after Arvid Wittenberg had died in Polish custody, his son Leonard Johan Wittenberg (born 1646) was accommodated as a ward by Arvid's friend, Carl Gustaf Wrangel. In the summer of 1673, Leonard Johan married Wrangel's daughter Polidora Christiana.Asmus (2003), p.197 Arvid Wittenberg was also the father of Beata Magdalena Wittenberg.

It is located on the Canterbury Plains south-west of Christchurch, and is considered a satellite town of the city. The town has a population of making it New Zealand's 32nd largest urban area. It was nicknamed the \\"Town of the Future\\" in the 1970s by Prime Minister Norman Kirk. The \\"Town of the Future\\" signage has since been removed from the entrances to Rolleston. History Rolleston originated as a railway terminus in 1866, and is named after the Canterbury statesman William Rolleston. Rolleston, who was born in Yorkshire in 1831 and died in 1903, served as Superintendent of the Province of Canterbury from 1868 until 1876 (when central government abolished the New Zealand provinces). He also served as a Member of Parliament, holding various Cabinet portfolios. In the 1970s, Prime Minister Norman Kirk had a dream of turning the town of less than 1,000 people into a city of 80,000. Selwyn District Council proposed an industrial subdivision, Izone, in 2000. The council purchased rural land adjacent to the Main South Line opposite the township of Rolleston, in the following year. The Warehouse Group has its South Island distribution centre at Izone. = Christchurch earthquakes = Rolleston was close to the epicentre of the 2010 Canterbury earthquake being near the end of the Greendale Fault, experiencing movement two times the strength of that in Christchurch City. Residents were without power following the quake, some for more than 48 hours, and were required to boil water for weeks before services were restored. Rolleston was close to many of the aftershocks following the September quake. Rolleston suffered low damage due to the ground having underlying stones and stable rock. For such reasons, Rolleston has not been affected by liquefaction to date, and only a few houses have been condemned and demolished from earthquake damage. The 2011 Christchurch earthquake caused a minor amount of extra damage, mostly to buildings which had already been previously affected. The population of Rolleston has expanded rapidly since the Christchurch earthquakes due to the land stability and fast tracking of building consents by the Selwyn District Council.  Amenities  Rolleston is home to Pineglades Naturist Club, the South Island's largest naturist resort. The Selwyn Aquatic Centre is in Rolleston. It has a 25 meter pool with eight lanes; a hydrotherapy pool ; a learn to swim pool; a leisure pool with a lazy river and toddlers area attached and a spa pool. The Rolleston Community Centre and Rolleston Library are located in the same building. The community centre offers a number of exercise classes. The Rolleston Skate Park opened in 2010. The playground next to it has a flying fox. The Selwyn Sports Centre is being built. It will have space for eight indoor courts and an indoor walking track. It is expected to open in April 2021.  Climate  The radiata pine plantations that were once a feature of this part of Canterbury have largely been replaced by more water-intensive grazing land to take advantage of the \\"dairy boom\\" of the early 21st century. Shelter belts of radiata, another significant earlier feature of the Plains (and very effective at mitigating the desiccating effects of the nor'west wind), have also been removed as they formed a barrier to the huge central-pivot irrigators that are now commonplace in the area. Rolleston is very exposed on the Canterbury Plains and is therefore slightly drier, with a more continental climate, than nearby Christchurch. There are many vineyards in the area. The warmest month of the year is January with an average high temperature of 23°C. The coldest month of the year occurs in July, when the average high temperature is 10°C. Monthly rainfall ranges between an average of 33mm in January to 56mm in July. Demographics Until 1990 the town had only a few sealed streets and a population of just under 1,000. The current expansion began in the 1990s. The Rolleston urban area had a population of 17,532 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 8,079 people (85.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 12,582 people (254.2%) since the 2006 census. There were 8,679 males and 8,850 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.98 males per female. Of the total population, 4,536 people (25.9%) were aged up to 15 years, 3,198 (18.2%) were 15 to 29, 8,541 (48.7%) were 30 to 64, and 1,251 (7.1%) were 65 or older. Ethnicities were 86.1% European/Pākehā, 9.4% Māori, 2.5% Pacific peoples, 8.9% Asian, and 2.8% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).  Education  Rolleston has five full primary (year 1–8) schools: *Clearview Primary School is a state school with a roll of approximately students. The school opened in February 2010. * Lemonwood Grove School is a state school with a roll of approximately students. The school opened in February 2017. *Rolleston School is a state school with a roll of approximately students. The school opened in 1893. *Rolleston Christian School is a state-integrated nondenominational Christian school with a roll of approximately students. The school opened in February 2015. *West Rolleston Primary School is a state school with a roll of approximately students. The school opened in February 2016. Rolleston College is the sole secondary school in Rolleston, with a roll of approximately students.. It opened on 30 January 2017, and as of 2020 is only open to Year 9–12 students, with other year levels added as students move through. Students in Year 13 are currently served by Lincoln High School, 12 km away in the nearby town of Lincoln.  Transport  Bus = Three local bus routes serve Rolleston, both being part of Environment Canterbury's Metro system: the Yellow Line route connects Rolleston with central Christchurch, Linwood, and New Brighton via Templeton, Hornby and Riccarton, route 820 (Burnham to Lincoln) connects Rolleston to the nearby towns of Burnham and Lincoln, and route 85 (Rolleston to Ara Institute) an express route connecting Rolleston with Central Christchurch and Ara Institute via Christchurch Hospital. = Rail = Rolleston is the site of the railway junction between the Midland line to Greymouth and the Main South Line. The town served as a major railway junction point from the 1880s until the late 1980s, when the New Zealand government deregulated the railways, and Rolleston became a stop only for the tourist-oriented TranzAlpine rail service. , passengers wanting to board the TranzAlpine at Rolleston must specify this when booking. In 1993 Rolleston saw one of the country's worst level-crossing accidents, when a cement mixer truck ran into the side of a passenger train at the now-closed George Holmes Road level crossing and killed 3 train passengers. = Road = State Highway 1 passes through Rolleston on its route between Christchurch and Timaru. In September 2020, the final lanes of the Christchurch Southern Motorway opened, connecting Addington (Brougham Street) and eastern Rolleston. This has significantly improved commuting times to Christchurch. A two-lane overbridge will be built to connect residential areas of Rolleston to the industrial zone (Izone), crossing SH1 from Rolleston Drive to Hoskyns Road. It will be built by 2025 at a cost of $60m.  Government  Rolleston is part of the Selwyn electorate. The Selwyn District Council is responsible for providing local government services to Rolleston. The Selwyn District Council is based in Rolleston at 2 Norman Kirk Drive.  Prison  Rolleston Prison is located just west of the town, housing up to 260 minimum to medium security male prisoners.

Bardhi is best known as an author of the early eras of Albanian literature. He served as Bishop of Sapë (1635–1644). (in Latin) Life Bardhi was born in Kallmet or Nënshat in the northern Albanian Zadrima region near Lezhë. He came from a family consisting of many figures high in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church and state officials or military commanders of the Republic of Venice. His uncle was Bishop of Sapa and Sarda. He studied theology in Italy. On 17 December 1635, Francesco Bianchi was appointed during the papacy of Pope Urban VIII as Bishop of Sapë. On 30 March 1636, he was consecrated bishop by Ciriaco Rocci, Cardinal-Priest of San Salvatore in Lauro, with Giovanni Battista Altieri, Bishop Emeritus of Camerino, and Ottavio Broglia, Bishop of Asti, serving as co-consecrators. Bardhi is remembered as the author of the first Albanian dictionary Dictionarium latino-epiroticum (Latin-Albanian dictionary) published in Rome in 1635, comprising 5,640 entries. Its appendix contains a list of 113 proverbs, phrases, and idioms, some of which are translations from other languages into Albanian with the vast majority being collected from the Albanian folklore. Bardhi also wrote a biography of George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, called The Apology of Scanderbeg published in Venice in 1636.Georgius Castriotus Epirensis, vulgo Scanderbegh. Per Franciscum Blancum, De Alumnis Collegij de Propaganda Fide Episcopum Sappatensem etc. Venetiis, Typis Marci Ginammi, MDCXXXVI (1636). The Apology of Scanderbeg was a polemic against Slavic Catholic priest Ivan Tomko Mrnavić, who claimed that Kastrioti was of Slav origin. Bardhi also complained that the Albanian language \\"was being lost and degenerating\\" under the blows of foreign occupiers, and in order to preserve it he saw himself contributing to the missing of rising the national pride between Albanians. From 1637 on, Bardhi submitted reports in Italian and Latin to the Congregation of the Propaganda Fide in Rome which contain a mine of information about his diocese, about political developments, about Albanian customs and about the structure and position of the Catholic Church in Ottoman-occupied Albania.

The Brookside campus was used for students in pre-school to Year Six, while Town Centre was for secondary students (Years Seven to Twelve). The Brookside campus was located at the Brookside Learning Centre, which hosted common facilities (such as administration facilities, library, gymnasium, arts rooms, and science rooms) shared by Mowbray, the Brookside campus of Caroline Springs College and Christ the Priest Catholic Primary School.

It runs between Marblehead, Massachusetts and Halifax, Nova Scotia. It is believed to be the longest running offshore ocean race in the world and is considered one of the pre- eminent ocean races of the North Atlantic. History The first race was held in 1905, starting on 21 August. The Boston Globe ran an article titled “Invitation Ocean Race Marblehead, U.S.A – Halifax, N.S.” > The regatta committee of the Eastern yacht club announces that the club is > arranging for an ocean race from Marblehead to Halifax, to be sailed in > August.This is the first international ocean race to be sailed between a > port In the United States and one in the provinces, and much good to > yachting may be expected from it.The promotion of such a race is in keeping > with a policy adopted by the club last year, to actively encourage sailing > on deep water.A consideration bearing on the selection of Halifax as the > termination of the course, was a desire to establish more neighborly > relations with our cousins across the gulf of Maine.The start on the morning > of Aug 21 is timed to find most of the large vessels of the New York yacht > club, that will have made the cruise of that club, still at Marblehead, > where they will have arrived on the afternoon of the 17th, if on time.

That first race was won by Elmina II in 45 hours 53 minutes 18 seconds, with Hope Leslie, and Corona third. The race was run sporadically until 1939, when the Boston Yacht Club joined with the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron to formalize a biennial event. In the 1939 race, thirteen yachts started and saw light-to-moderate winds and fog conditions that proved challenging for the racers. Twelve yachts completed the race with Tioga Too winning with a nine- hour lead. Because of World War II, the race was not run from 1939 to 1947, when the MHOR was given international race ranking. Twenty-two yachts were registered with three of them being Canadian. Since that time, the MHOR has run regularly on alternate years from the Newport Bermuda Race, as one of the pre-eminent ocean races of the North Atlantic. The race The race begins in the early afternoon on the first Sunday after July 4th at \\"Tinkers Gong\\", just outside Marblehead Harbor. In many years over 400 spectator boats observe the 100 racing yachts at the starting line. The competing boats range in size from better than to over . The course runs slightly north of due east leaving Marblehead and sailing past Cape Ann. By the time they reach the open waters of the Gulf of Maine, the fleet has separated for the overnight journey. The tremendous tidal currents in the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy system, as well as the ever-present changing weather conditions create a unique tactical challenge for the racing crews. Land is sighted near Cape Sable Island after crossing the Gulf of Maine. The fleet then races along the coast of Nova Scotia toward Halifax Harbour. The finish line is located offshore from the RNSYS marina at the entrance to the Northwest Arm. The 2019 Marblehead to Halifax Ocean Race will get underway on July 7. =Race record= The current race record is 28 hours, 28 minutes and 50 seconds; set in 2017 by the yacht Prospector. They took more than two hours off the 2011 record set by Bella PITA (Bill Tripp design , skippered by Jim Grundy). MHOR, an ISAF Category 2 event, is a well-known event in North America's sailing community, usually attracting in excess of 100 boats sailing in 5 different divisions. The MHOR is a qualifier for the Northern Ocean Racing Trophy for IRC yachts, the New England Lighthouse Series for Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) yachts and the Offshore Racing Rule (ORR) East Coast Championship. Awards In 2017 MHOR the following Trophies were awarded: The Halifax Herald and The Halifax Mail Trophy (1935), awarded to the monohull with the fastest elapsed time over the course.

By early 1999, Ascent was about to be broken up due to financial problems, mostly stemming from building the Pepsi Center in Denver. Bernstein and venture capitalist Kevin O’Donnell purchased Beacon back, restoring its independent company status.

Barra is well known for its beaches, its many lakes and rivers, and its lifestyle. This neighbourhood represents 4.7% of the city population and 13% of the total area of Rio de Janeiro. Barra da Tijuca is classified as one of the most developed places in Brazil, with one of the highest Human Development Indexes (HDI) in the country, as measured in the 2000 Brazil Census. Unlike the South Zone and Rio's Downtown, Barra da Tijuca, built only 30 years ago, follows the Modernist standards, with large boulevards creating the major transit axis. The area's masterplan was designed by Lúcio Costa, known for his work on Brasília, and creates a region filled with many gardens, shopping malls, apartment buildings and large mansions. In recent years, because of the development of the Brazilian economy, Barra has received more than 100,000 new residents and many companies' headquarters looking for a more modern address. Demographic data indicates that the region is the fastest growing county in Rio: 98,851 in 1991, 174,353 in 2000, and 300,823 in 2010. Those born in Barra da Tijuca, or those who live there, are called Barristas, or Barrenses. The neighborhood is a cultural, economic, and administrative hub of the city, and is believed to be the safest of Rio's upper-class neighbourhoods because of its lack of favelas and plentiful private and public security. It is the home of several celebrities and football players. In August 2016, Barra hosted most of the venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics, the first held in South America. Etymology The name Barra da Tijuca can be roughly translated as \\"clay sandbank\\". Barra means port entrance or sandbank, and Tijuca is a word originally from the Tupi ty-yúc and means putrid water, mud, swamp, puddle, clay or clay-pit. Tijuca () (meaning marsh or swamp) from ty (\\"water\\") and îuká (\\"to kill\\"). History Barra da Tijuca in the 1950s The region of Barra da Tijuca was originally a large beach, with typical undergrowth sandbanks. The area, full of swamps and unsuitable for planting, remained unoccupied until the middle of the twentieth century, even though occasional groups of fishermen frequented the region. In 1667, the region was given to religious Benedictines, who settled only in the neighborhoods of Camorim, Vargem Pequena, and Vargem Grande. In 1900, the lands of Barra da Tijuca and Baixada Jacarepaguá were sold to the company Remedial Territorial Agricultural and SA, ESTA, which remains a large land owner in the area. The concentration of large tracts of land in the hands of a few was one of the causes of its late growth. Additionally it is separated from the rest of the municipality by large, difficult-to-cross mountain ranges with peaks ranging from 800–1200 meters. Development of the area took place initially on its two ends, in current Jardim Oceânico and in Recreio dos Bandeirantes. A bridge was then built by private initiative over the Tijuca Lagoon to serve the area's new inhabitants. Significant early development of Barra da Tijuca occurred during the administration of Governor Negrão de Lima, the former governor of the state of Guanabara, who commissioned Lúcio Costa, one of the region's urban designers. The plan for Barra in 1969 was similar to the earlier one for Brasília. It was inspired by American urban planning style with wide boulevards and large open spaces. In the 1970s the Lagoa–Barra Highway was built, which allowed a greater development since it reduced the time to go to the South Zone of the city of Rio. At the same time, large planned condominiums were developed in Barra, such as the condominiums Nova Ipanema and Novo Leblon. In the 1990s, another large urban development that enabled better connection with the North Zone of Rio was the creation of the Yellow Line, an expressway linking Barra da Tijuca to the Galeão International Airport. Since then, the growth of Barra da Tijuca has been characterized by large inflows of people from all parts of the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. = Barra City's Project = During the 1980s, Barra da Tijuca experienced a population explosion, with virtually all the land along its boulevards occupied by large residential condominiums, parks, supermarkets, shopping malls, schools and hospitals. The avenues were widened and received traffic lights. At this time there was a movement for the declaration of Barra as a separate city; While there was a referendum to this effect, and a majority of voters voted to make it a separate city, turnout was too low for it to succeed. There is still a bill in progress in the Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro for the formation of a new Barra da Tijuca council from the region's districts (Barra, Recreio, Grumari, Vargem Pequena, Vargem Grande, Itanhangá, Joá e Camorim). The project, however, depends on the approval of the Federal Congressional bill PEC 13/03, which transfers to the states the power to legislate on this matter, as it was until 1996. Lifestyle Península's residential towers. 300px As the most recent region, built only about thirty years ago, Barra introduced a way of living characterized by large luxury condominiums with leisure infrastructure (sports courts, pools, private groves and lakes, spas, gyms) inside of the condominium for the use of its residents and guests. The \\"neighborhood-condos\\", as they were named, have the idea of creating an exclusive neighborhood for its residents, making it possible for them to live a complete life without the need to leave the condominium. The condos also have a high security system to ensure the privacy and safety of its residents. The residential areas of Barra are also known as being environmentally friendly. The region is characterized by a car culture, and is crossed by three main routes: the Avenue of the America - \\"Avenida das Américas\\" (the main road in the region, approximately 21 km long), \\"Avenida Ayrton Senna\\" (which connects the district of Barra and the Yellow Line, or 'Linha Amarela' highway) and \\"Avenida Lúcio Costa\\", formerly Sernambetiba Avenue, which follows the coastline. Areas Barra da Tijuca at night View of Recreio dos Bandeirantes, Barra da Tijuca, from Pontal's Island. Ayrton Senna Avenue Barra da Tijuca at night =Jardim Oceânico= Jardim Oceânico (Portuguese: Ocean Garden) is a subdistrict of Barra da Tijuca. Predominantly formed by three-story buildings It is an area similar to the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. As part of the preparations for the Rio 2016 Olympics, a subway station was opened in the neighborhood. The mainly residential area is also home to several bars and restaurants on the Olegario Maciel and Erico Verissimo streets. =Península= Península was designed by a real estate company, the original project being the creation of a new environmentally friendly neighborhood called Península Barra. However, the project evolved from being a neighborhood to a massive private urban development complex, making the Península (which has the same size of Leblon's neighborhood) the newest and first eco-friendly urban development complex in Rio de Janeiro. Located in the heart of Barra, right behind the Barra Shopping in an area surrounded by its own private lake (Península Bay) and extensive leisure infrastructure, Península won the prize of the best urban development complex in Brazil. The complex, which still has some towers under construction, will consist at its completion of 62 residential towers, two business towers, a mini mall, five theme gardens and two large parks. The real estate boom in Rio after the city was chosen for the 2016 Summer Olympics affected the prices in Península; researches show that the prices have increased up to 300%, making the square meter in Península one of the most expensive in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The complex, considered one of the best family urban developments in the city, is now one of the favorite places of the celebrities of Rede Globo. Education Several universities have a campus in the district, including Universidade Estácio de Sá, Pontifícia Universidade Católica, Universidade Gama Filho, Universidade Veiga de Almeida, Centro Universitário IBMR-Laureate and Instituto Brasileiro de Mercado de Capitais. Schools in the district include the Escola Suíço-Brasileira Rio de Janeiro.\\"Localização - Mapa.\\" Escola Suíço-Brasileira Rio de Janeiro.

BarraShopping Sign Transportation There are three main avenues in Barra: Avenida das Américas (which connects almost the whole area of Barra), Avenida Ayrton Senna (formerly Avenida Alvorada, which connects Barra to Jacarepaguá neighbourhood) and Avenida Lúcio costa (formerly Avenida Sernambetiba, which passes alongside the beach). The connection works of Barra with the rest of the urban network are among the most expensive works already carried out in Rio. Barra has many bus routes and in 2009, Barra's subway line started to be built for the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics. Jacarepaguá Airport, an airport specialized in general aviation, is also located in the neighborhood.

Beach Reserva beach Recreio beach The 18 km long beach is the largest of Rio de Janeiro's beaches. Barra's beach starts at Morro do Joá and ends at the Recreio dos Bandeirantes neighborhood, in Pontal de Sernambetiba, beyond Avenida Lúcio Costa. Most of its waters are clear and green, and have an uncommon wave formation. Barra da Tijuca beach is one of the most sought after beaches by surfers, windsurfers, bodyboarders, kitesurfers and fishing enthusiasts. There is also a cycling lane along the beach. Pepê beach, closer do Morro do Joá, has kite surf schools, food kiosks, and surf schools. CultureTeatro dos Grandes Atores= The Teatro dos Grandes Atores (Great Actors Theater) is located in the Shopping Barra Square mall. It has a small 35 square metres (380 sq ft) foyer, and two auditoriums, each with 396 seats, the Blue Room and the Red Room. Both have good acoustics, and balconies that give good views of the stage. The theater opened in 1995 with Aparecida Margarida, with Marília Pêra, in the Blue Room and A Era do Rádio directed by Sérgio Britto in the Red Room. Ricardo Torres was staged here in 1996. Since 2009 the theater has partnered with Agência do Bem, and since 2011 has let the agency's Orquestra Nova Sinfonia, a youth orchestra, use its stage for rehearsals. Criticism The influence from different countries is criticized by many citizens from the older areas of Rio de Janeiro, especially concerning the 26.8 meters (88 feet) high replica of the Statue of Liberty in the New York City Center. Barra also has replicas of many international architectural icons like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Tower Bridge of London, and the Eiffel Tower of Paris (all found in the Barra World Shopping Center).

The area that is now Vladivostok was settled by ancient peoples, such as the Mohe, the Goguryeo, the Balhae and the later Liao and Jīn Dynasties. The area was ceded by China to Russia as a result of the Treaty of Aigun of 1858 and the Treaty of Peking of 1860.  Chinese influence  On Chinese maps from the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), Vladivostok is called Yongmingcheng (永明城 [Yǒngmíngchéng], \\"city of eternal light\\"). During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) it was visited by Chinese expeditions, and a relic of that time (a Chongning stela) is displayed in the local museum. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk defined the area as part of China under the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Later, as the Manchus banned Han Chinese from most of Manchuria (including the Vladivostok region), it was only visited by shēnzéi (參賊, ginseng or sea cucumber thieves) who illegally entered the area seeking ginseng or sea cucumbers (ambiguous, since both words use the Chinese 參, shēn). From this comes the current Chinese name for the city, 海參崴 (Hǎishēnwǎi, \\"sea-cucumber cliffs\\"). A French ship which is believed to have visited the area around 1858 found several huts belonging to Han or Manchu fishermen. No foreign or Chinese maps show any sizable Chinese settlement there within the decades prior to the founding of Vladivostok. There is also the Udge, the Orochi, the Nanai, and the Mohe living in Vladivostok.  Russian control  Count Nikolay N. Muravyov During the summer of 1859 the governor-general of eastern Siberia, Nikolay N. Muravyov, visited the peninsula and bay (somewhat similar to the Bay of the Golden Horn in Constantinople) on the steam corvette Amerika. The peninsula was named Muravyov-Amursky in his honor. The first Europeans to visit the bay, later named the Golden Horn Bay, were the crews of the British warships HMS Winchester and HMS Barracouta in 1855. = Origins of the modern city = On June 20, 1860 (July 2 Gregorian style) the military supply ship Manchur, under Captain-Lieutenant Alexey K. Shefner, called at Golden Horn Bay to found the outpost of Vladivostok. Warrant officer Nikolay Komarov, with 28 soldiers and two non-commissioned officers under his command, were brought from Nikolayevsk-on-Amur by ship to construct its first buildings. They pitched camp, selecting a site where the entrance to Golden Horn Bay was always visible. In 1862, under the leadership of Yevgeny Burachyok, Vladivostok became an official port. To encourage foreign trade, it was designated a free port for imports. In 1864, the Southern Harbors command was moved to Vladivostok from Nikolayevsk-on-Amur. A year later a shipbuilding yard was founded in the city, and the first settlers from Nikolayevsk-on-Amur began arriving. In 1871 the naval port, military governor's residence, and main base of the Siberian Military Flotilla moved from Nikolayevsk-on-Amur to Vladivostok, and the Great Northern Telegraph Company connected Vladivostok to Nagasaki and Shanghai by underwater cable. Vladivostok's first street was Amerikanskaya Street (ул. Американская), named for the corvette America in 1871. Two years later, it was renamed Svetlanskaya Street (ул. Светланская) in honor of the frigate Svetlana on which Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia visited Vladivostok. At that time, it consisted of present Svetlanskaya Street from Amursky Bay to number 85. Its other parts were separate streets with names such as Portovaya (Портовая), Afanasyevskaya (Афанасьевская), and Ekipazhnaya (Экипажная). In 1878, 40 percent of the city's over 4,000 residents were foreigners. This was reflected in street names such as Koreyskaya (Korean), Pekinskaya (Peking), and Kitayskaya (Chinese), whose present names are Pogranichnaya (ул. Пограничная), Admirala Fokina (ул. Адмирала Фокина), and Okeansky Avenue (Океанский проспект). Imperial Russian Navy torpedo boat Sungari at Vladivostok In 1880 the Russian Volunteer Fleet, with government aid, organized regular trips to Odessa and Saint Petersburg. On April 28, 1880 (May 10 Gregorian style), Vladivostok was officially proclaimed a city and a separate administrative unit from Primorskaya Oblast. At that time the city population was 7,300, double that of 1878. Three hotels were in operation: the Moscow, the Vladivostok, and the Hotel de Louvre. In 1883 the Resettlement Administration was established in Vladivostok, and Russian Volunteer Fleet steamships began a mass transport of peasants from European Russia to the Far East. Vladivostok became a shipping center, and in 1888 the residence of the oblast governor was moved from Khabarovsk to the city. In 1889 Vladivostok was proclaimed a fortress and two torpedo boats, brought disassembled from the Black Sea, were launched. Trans-Siberian Railway terminal in Vladivostok During the 1880s Vladivostok's cultural life improved, and a music school at the Siberian Fleet Depot was opened. In 1883 the city's first newspaper (Vladivostok) began, and the following year the Society of the Amursky Territory Study (headed by Fyodor F. Busse) was founded. In 1887 a public library opened, and a professional theater performed in Vladivostok for the first time. Trees were planted along the main streets, and 120 kerosene streetlamps were installed. By the end of the 1880s Vladivostok had about 600 wooden and more than 50 stone houses, some two or three stories. Most buildings were grouped in the area of today's central square and the Matrosskaya Sloboda (Sailors' Suburb), from the Obyasneniya River to the Gaydamak tram stop. In 1891, construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway began in Vladivostok. During the 1890s, shipping to Kobe, Nagasaki, and Shanghai began. In 1897 a new commercial port was opened in Vladivostok, and regular rail service to Khabarovsk began. In 1899 the first Far Eastern higher educational institution, the Oriental Institute, was established. It presently houses the main building of Far Eastern State Technical University (FESTU). From 1899 to 1909, four theaters opened in Vladivostok: the Tikhy Okean (Pacific Ocean) Theater, the Public Theater (inspired by the Moscow Artistic Theater), the Zolotoy Rog (Golden Horn) Theater, and the Pushkin Theater (which hosted Russian actress Vera Kommisarzhevskaya). In 1912 a newspaper, The Theater and Music, was first published. Varyag in Golden Horn Bay, 1903 During the Russo-Japanese War, a Japanese squadron of warships fired on the city. The Vladivostok Cruiser Group participated in the war, blocking approaches to besieged Port-Arthur. Vladivostok was involved in the Revolution of 1905, and was governed by rebel military units in early 1906. Unrest in the city was quelled with force and diplomacy by General Georgi Kazbek. During the period between the two Russian revolutions (1907-1917) a 17th-century-style railway station, a power station, two girls' schools, a school of commerce, and the Versailles Hotel were built, and trams began operating. In 1909 the port was visited by 795 steamships, including 477 foreign ships, and there were about 3,000 shops in Vladivostok. In 1913, local publishers produced 61 titles in Russian and other languages. = After the Revolution = Wolfhounds on parade in Vladivostok, August 1918 A 1919 poster depicting the Japanese occupation of Vladivostok After the October Revolution of 1917, on December 31, Japanese, British and American cruisers entered Golden Horn Bay. In April 1918, the Japanese company Isido was attacked in Vladivostok. After this incident, the Japanese and British commands landed troops to protect their citizens. The Entente soon expanded its Siberian Intervention; Canada sent 4,000 troops, headquartered in the Pushkin Theater with a barracks at Second River and Gornostai Bay.Canada's Siberian Expedition websiteBenjamin Isitt, \\"Mutiny from Victoria to Vladivostok, December 1918,\\" Canadian Historical Review, 87:2 (June 2006) Bolshevik supporters conducted a partisan struggle in the city. From 1916 through 1922, Vladivostok's population went from 97,000 to 410,000 as opponents of the new regime (including the White Army) retreated to the east. From 1920 to 1922, cultural refugees from Moscow and Saint Petersburg founded two conservatories, two theaters and several symphony orchestras and published art magazines. After the Bolshevik victory, most moved abroad and by 1926 Vladivostok had a population of 108,000. On October 25, 1922 the last interventionist units left the city, and the Red Army assumed control. On November 15 the Far Eastern Republic, which had existed since 1920, became part of the RSFSR. The Bolsheviks understood Vladivostok's strategic importance, and during the 1920s and 1930s reconstruction of its port began. In the early 1930s direct air service to Moscow began, and in 1932 the city became the base of the Pacific Naval Fleet. During the early 1920s, Far Eastern State University was established in Vladivostok; in the late 1930s, under Stalin, it was closed for twenty years. In 1925 the Pacific Scientific-Commercial Station, reorganized as the Pacific Scientific-Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (TINRO) in 1930, was established in the city. In 1932, the Far Eastern Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences was founded. In 1926, Vladivostok's first radio station began broadcasting. Three theaters and three cinemas were opened in the city in 1931. The Primorye Picture Gallery's collection was assembled from 1929 to 1931. About 1,000 pictures were brought there from the Hermitage, the Russian Museum and the Tretyakovskaya Gallery. Many ethnic groups considered rebellious by Stalin's eyes, including Chinese, Manchu, Jews, Ukrainians, Poles, Crimean Tatars, Chechens, and Armenians, were transported. During the 1930s mass repression began in the country, and a transit camp for political prisoners sent from western Russia to Kolyma was opened in Vladivostok. The prisoners arrived by train and left on prison ships in terrible conditions. Soviets at first, after 1939 the prisoners came from Eastern Europe and were Japanese POWs after World War II. Factories, ports and cities in the Far East were built by prison labor during the 1930s. After American pilots bombed Tokyo on April 18, 1942, one of the sixteen B-25 bombers landed in Vladivostok when it ran out of fuel; the bomber was confiscated and its crew interned. Although Captain Edward York and his crewmates were well-treated, diplomatic efforts to return them to the United States failed. They were eventually moved to Ashgabat ( from the Iranian border); York bribed a smuggler to help them cross the border and reach a nearby British consulate on 11 May 1943. According to declassified Soviet archives, the smuggling was staged by the NKVD because the Soviet government felt it could not repatriate them legally due to its neutrality pact with Japan. In 1954 First Secretary of the Communist Party Nikita Khrushchev visited Vladivostok, the first Russian leader to do so. After Khrushchev's visit, urban development began. Vladivostok in 2003In 1956 the Far Eastern State University, the only classical university in the Russian Far East, was reopened. The microdistrict of Churkin was built during the late 1950s, and Vtoraya Rechka (Second River) and Morgorodok were developed during the early 1960s. Vladivostok's last large district built with new, multistory houses is at Patrisa Lumumby and Neybuta Streets, begun in 1980. From the 1950s to the 1980s the fishing industry was developed. For many years the ports of Vladivostok ranked first in freight turnover in the Russian Far East, recently yielding to Nakhodka. The city also produced a large volume of military goods. From 1930 to the 1970s, foreigners were not allowed to visit Vladivostok, but in 1974 the Vladivostok Summit Meeting on Arms Control was held with General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) Leonid Brezhnev and US President Gerald Ford. After Ford's visit the city, home to the Pacific Fleet, was again closed until 1992. As of 1996 there were six consulates, four offices of Japanese television companies, a US information service, more than 100 offices of foreign companies and about 600 joint ventures in Vladivostok.

Stonefest is run by UC Live - the music and live entertainment division of the UCX (the University of Canberra Union), who have been responsible for the event for its entire life span. History Stone Day started as a celebration at the University of Canberra held annually to mark the laying of the foundation stone by Prime Minister John Gorton on 28 October 1968. This founded the Canberra College of Advanced Education, which became the University of Canberra in 1990. The first foundation celebrations were held in 1971. In 1973 Stone Day celebrations were held over two days, which was expanded to take up a whole week in 1976. In the 1980s and 1990s Stoneweek became a popular Canberra entertainment event. In the 1990s it was given themes such as \\"Return to Woodstock\\", \\"Circus\\", \\"Back to the Beach\\", \\"Alien Abduction\\", \\"Oktoberfest\\", \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Stoneage\\". In the year 2000 the festival became Stonefest. For many years Stonefest was the largest music festival in Canberra and a popular one in Australia. In recent years other festivals have made their way onto the Canberra scene, including Groovin' The Moo (also on the University of Canberra Campus) and Foreshore Summer Music Festival, contributing to declining numbers for Stonefest. In 2012, organisers made the decision to return the festival to its roots as a University celebration, re-branding the event as Stone Day, giving it a fresh new look and feel and returning tickets to the student-friendly price of $25. In June 2019, Stonefest social media channels became active after a long hiatus, teasing the festival's return. On 11 June the lineup for Stonefest 2019 was announced, featuring artists from the local Canberra area, wider Australian music scene and a notable international artist in Example. Stonefest will return in 2021, as 2020 is on hiatus on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic.

It is situated south of Bridlington town centre and north-east of Beverley town centre on the A165 road that connects the two towns. Together with Ulrome it forms the civil parish of Lissett and Ulrome. In 1823 Lissett, with a population of 95, was in the parish of Beeford, and the Wapentake and Liberty of Holderness. A chapel of ease existed in the village.Baines, Edward (1823): History, Directory and Gazetteer of the County of York, p. 363 In 1942 an RAF station, RAF Lissett, was built there. Its main role was to serve as a bomber airfield for the Halifax Bomber 158 Squadron. It had a short life - the final mission left the airbase on 25 April 1945. The airfield is now part of a small industrial estate in the village. In December 2008 a 30 MW wind farm housing twelve turbines each high was constructed across the western end of the airfield. The village church, St James, is a Grade II listed building and houses the oldest dated bell in England, dated 1254. Perhaps of 14th-century origin, it was rebuilt by Hugh Roumieu Gough in 1876. Remaining from the previous church are fragments of a Norman capital in the east wall.

It has been found at least as far east as the coast of Texas. It stood about 60 centimetres tall at the shoulders and weighed about 10 kilograms (22 lb). It is unclear whether females had horns as well as males. Each horn consists of a pair of short, straight points that sprout from a single base on either side of the head, with the two prongs parallel rather than diverging as in Tetrameryx and Stockoceros. A number of different species have been described which are likely all the same: Capromeryx furcifer, Capromeryx mexicana and Capromeryx minimus. Capromeryx furcifer would have priority as the proper name for the Late Irvingtonian through Rancholabrean species in which the anterior prong is less than 50% the height of the posterior prong. Its fossils have also been found at least as far east at as the Texas coast, as well as in Nebraska, Kansas, New Mexico, Sonora, Baja California, and near Mexico City. Specimens of this species (and its synonyms) date to the Late Irvingtonian and Rancholabrean periods. Two earlier species are known: Capromeryx tautonensis from Washington state and from Central Mexico in the Early Blancan, and Capromeryx arizonensis from the Late Blancan in Arizona, New Mexico and Florida. These two earlier species were larger and heavier than the Pleistocene species. It is thought by some biologists that it lived in forests and underbrush, where its small size would have helped it to hide. It is unlikely that it lived in open prairies, since it would not have been fast enough to outrun the predators of that time.

(died 14 February 1831) was a Ras of Begemder and Enderase (regent) of the Emperor of Ethiopia. He was the brother of his predecessor Ras Yimam. The missionary Samuel Gobat had a low opinion of Marye. He wrote in his journal, \\"A character worse is attributed to Mariam [Marye], cannot be well given to a prince. He does justice to none. Far from punishing a soldier for robbing or killing his companion, he publicly commends him, as a man of courage. It is said that he has ordered all of his soldiers, on entering Oubea's territories, to kill every human being they meet, without distinction of age or sex; threatening with death the soldier, known to have spared a single person in his power.\\"Gobat, Journal, p. 181 However, Gobat's opinion may have been influenced by a raid Marye's men made on Gondar 14 May 1830, which he described immediately before this passage.  Life  During the rule of his father, Ras Yejju, Marye challenged his father's authority with an open rebellion; Marye was defeated in battle. After Gugsa's death Marye also challenged the succession of his own brother Yimam by rebelling.Donald Crummey, \\"Family and Property amongst the Amhara Nobility\\", Journal of African History, special issue: The History of the Family in Africa, 24 1983, p. 218 Marye had his capital in Debre Tabor, from 1828 to 1831. Upon Meru of Dembiya's death, he was given that warlord's territories in Dembiya, Wegera and Belessa to rule, but he had not held them for very long before Meru's relations came forward with their own claims; the immediate claimants included Dejazmach Walde Tekle, who claimed the lands for himself, and Welette Tekle, who claimed them for her son Kinfu. The struggle over control of these territories continued long after Marye's death, eventually involving Empress Menen Liben Amede.Sven Rubenson, King of Kings: Tewodros of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1966), pp. 21ff Marye's final military campaign was against Ras Sabagadis of Agame, who had succeeded Wolda Selassie as the dominant warlord of Tigray. Supported by Wube Haile Maryam of Semien and Goshu of Gojjam, Marye led his army across the Takazze River and defeated Sebagadis at the Battle of Debre Abbay (14 February 1831). However, Ras Marye was killed in the battle, and Sebagadis surrendered to Wube. Wube handed the defeated warlord to Ras Marye's Oromo troops, who killed their defeated foe, and ravaged Tigray in revenge for their leader's death.

H. Lawrence that he originally wrote in two parts and published in 1929. Lawrence wrote the first part in 1927 after visiting some Etruscan tombs with his friend Earl Brewster, a trip that encouraged the author to reflect upon death and myths of resurrection. He added the second part in 1928 during a stay in Gstaad, Switzerland. Publication The Black Sun Press first published The Escaped Cock as a limited edition in September 1929. Fifty copies were printed on Japanese vellum, signed by Lawrence and the copy number written in longhand by him, with decorations in color by the author. Critic Harry Moore considered the work to be the last of Lawrence's important prose fiction.  Origins  The Escaped Cock was always Lawrence's preferred title, but the tale has also been printed under the title The Man Who Died by some later publishers. In February 1930, the dying Lawrence was negotiating about an unlimited edition with the London publisher, Charles Lahr. Lahr asked for the title to be changed to The Man Who Died and Lawrence eventually agreed, insisting that the original title should be retained as a subtitle. This projected Lahr edition failed to appear and the first English edition was eventually published by Martin Secker in September 1931 as The Man Who Died, a title never approved by the author. The work was illustrated with wood-engravings by John Farleigh.Collections Virginia and Albert Museum. Brenda Maddox suggests that Martin Secker rejected the original title because of the double entendre. However, she writes, ″Lawrence emphatically denied the vernacular meaning of a plain English word. He refused to acknowledge that ′cock′ connoted anything but a rooster, just as he denied the blasphemous pun contained in the story's climactic line, uttered as the man observes the miracle between his legs: ′I am risen!′″Maddox, Brenda (1994), D.H. Lawrence: The Story of a Marriage, p. 414.  Plot summary  The story is a recasting of the resurrection of Christ narrated in the New Testament. The man who survives his crucifixion comes to celebrate his bodily existence and sensuality. Lawrence himself summarized The Escaped Cock in a letter to Brewster (May 3, 1927):  Manuscript  Lawrence's handwritten manuscript for The Escaped Cock is part of the rare book collection at the Grinnell College Libraries Special Collections and Archives. The book was formerly part of the Salisbury House until the Salisbury House collection of rare books and manuscripts was sold to Grinnell College in August 2019.https://www.grinnell.edu/news/college-moves-salisbury-house-library- collection-campus Cosmetics magnate Carl Weeks, who built Salisbury House, acquired the manuscript from rare book dealer Harry F. Marks of New York. In correspondence between Weeks and Lawrence's widow, Frieda (also located in the Grinnell College Special Collections and Archives), Mrs Lawrence noted that the manuscript had been given by Lawrence to Black Sun Press owner/publisher Harry Crosby, \\"NOT as a gift\\" (Mrs Lawrence's words), but that after Crosby's death, the manuscript did not \\"come home.\\" Frieda concluded her note to Weeks by saying she was satisfied by his stewardship of the document, so long as he left it for the public good, because \\"such is the nature of genius.\\"  References  Further reading  * The Complete Short Novels, Edited by Keith Sagar and Melissa Partridge, Penguin English Library, 1982  External links  * The Man Who Died at Project Gutenberg Australia Category:1929 British novels Category:Novels by D.

Patrick L. Murphy).  Pre-1960 name  Documents of the Holy See such as the Decree of the Congregation of Sacred Rites of 14 March 1906 spoke of Missa cantata sine Ministris (Sung/Chanted Mass without the Ministers). The 19th-century Ceremonial for the Use of the Catholic Churches in the United States of America (commonly called the \\"Baltimore Ceremonial\\" because published by request of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore of 1884) used the name: High Mass without Deacon or Sub-DeaconBaltimore Ceremonial, page 67  Classification  The Baltimore Ceremonial thus classified the Missa cantata as a High Mass. The early 20th-century Catholic Encyclopedia said, on the contrary, that a Missa cantata \\"is really a low Mass, since the essence of high Mass is not the music but the deacon and subdeacon. Only in churches which have no ordained person except one priest, and in which high Mass is thus impossible, is it allowed to celebrate the Mass (on Sundays and feasts) with most of the adornment borrowed from high Mass, with singing and (generally) with incense.\\"Adrian Fortescue, \\"Liturgy of the Mass\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York, 1910) In 1960, Pope John XXIII's Code of Rubrics distinguished the Missa cantata both from a high Mass and from low Mass. Under the number 271, it defined the forms of Mass as follows:  Ceremonial  The Missa cantata came into use during the 18th century and was intended for use in non-Catholic countries where the services of a deacon or a subdeacon (or clergy to fill these parts in the ceremony of the Mass) were not easily had. It was intended to be used in place of Solemn Mass on Sundays and major feast days. The use of incense at a Missa cantata was at first forbidden, but became general: \\"The Sacred Congregation of Rites has on several occasions (9 June 1884; 7 December 1888) forbidden the use of incense at a Missa Cantata; nevertheless, exceptions have been made for several dioceses, and the custom of using it is now generally tolerated.\\" General permission was finally granted in the 1960 Code of Rubrics, which stated: \\"The incensations that are obligatory in Solemn Mass are permitted in every Missa Cantata\\".\\"Incensationes quae in Missa solemni fieri debent, fieri possunt etiam in omnibus Missis cantatis\\" (Code of Rubrics, 426) The parts sung by the priest are to be sung in Gregorian chant. More elaborate musical settings of the choir's parts may also be used.Scott A. Haynes, \\"Guidelines for Liturgical Services according to the 1962 Missale Romanum: Music for High Mass\\"  Current situation  The rigid distinction between a sung Mass and a low Mass in the Roman Rite was abandoned in the 1969 revision of the Roman Missal. The General Instruction of the Roman Missal even states: \\"It is very appropriate that the priest sing those parts of the Eucharistic Prayer for which musical notation is provided.\\"General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 147 Under the heading \\"The Importance of Singing\\", it says: \\"Great importance should therefore be attached to the use of singing in the celebration of the Mass, with due consideration for the culture of the people and abilities of each liturgical assembly. Although it is not always necessary (e.g., in weekday Masses) to sing all the texts that are of themselves meant to be sung, every care should be taken that singing by the ministers and the people is not absent in celebrations that occur on Sundays and on holy days of obligation.\\"General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 40 ReferencesExternal links *Preparations for a Missa Cantata - Handbook for Sacristan by Rev.

In Malagasy, masiaka means \\"vicious\\"; thus, the genus name means \\"vicious lizard\\". The type species, Masiakasaurus knopfleri, was named after the musician Mark Knopfler, whose music inspired the expedition crew. It was named in 2001 by Scott D. Sampson, Matthew Carrano, and Catherine A. Forster. Unlike most theropods, the front teeth of M. knopfleri projected forward instead of straight down. This unique dentition suggests that they had a specialized diet, perhaps including fish and other small prey. Other bones of the skeleton indicate that Masiakasaurus were bipedal, with much shorter forelimbs than hindlimbs. M. knopfleri reached an estimated adult body length of around . Masiakasaurus lived around 70 million years ago, along with animals such as Majungasaurus, Rapetosaurus, and Rahonavis. Masiakasaurus was a member of the group Noasauridae, small predatory ceratosaurs found primarily in South America. Description Size comparison Masiakasaurus were small-bodied ceratosaurs. In 2010 Paul estimated its length at , its weight at 20 kg (44 lbs). In 2016 Molina-Pérez and Larramendi gave a much larger size of 4.6 meters (15.1 ft) and 128 kg (282 lbs) with a hip height of 1.25 meters (4.1 ft) for the FMNH PR 2457 specimen which represents a subadult. = Skull = Reconstructed skull, Field Museum of Natural History The most distinctive characteristic of Masiakasaurus is the forward-projecting, or procumbent, front teeth. The teeth are heterodont, meaning that they have different shapes along the jaw. The first four dentary teeth of the lower jaw project forward, with the first tooth angled only 10° above the horizontal. These teeth are long and spoon-shaped with hooked edges. They have carinae, or sharp edges, that are weakly serrated. Serrations are more evident along the rear edge the posterior teeth in the back of the jaw, which are also recurved and laterally compressed (flattened from the side), resembling the less unusual teeth of other carnivorous dinosaurs. The margin of the dentary curves downward so that the alveoli (tooth sockets) of the front teeth are directed forward. In fact, the alveolus of the first tooth is actually situated lower than the bottom edge of the rest of the lower jaw. The lower part of the rear edge of the dentary has a long prong, known as a ventral process. This differs from the situation in abelisaurids, which have a much shorter ventral process. On the other hand, the upper part of the rear edge of the dentary is very similar to that of abelisaurids such as Majungasaurus and Carnotaurus. This part of the bone possesses an array of four small structures, three of which line a socket which connects to the surangular bone at the back of the lower jaw. Although the surangular bone is not preserved, several other bones of the lower jaw are, including a triangular angular bone, a gently curving prearticular bone, and a damaged yet notably concave articular bone. The angular and prearticular formed the lower edge of a large and rounded in the lower jaw (known as a mandibular fenestra) while the articular bone formed the lower part of the jaw joint. A long and tapering hyoid (tongue bone) has also been preserved. The front teeth of the upper jaw are also procumbent, and the margin of the premaxilla curves slightly upward to direct them outward. Unlike the skulls of abelisaurids, which are very deep, the skull of Masiakasaurus is long and low. The lacrimal and postorbital bones around the eye are textured with bumpy projections. Not including the highly modified jaws and teeth, the skull of Masiakasaurus possesses many general ceratosaurian characteristics. Overall, its morphology is intermediate between abelisaurids and more basal ceratosaurs. = Vertebrae = Life restoration The neck is relatively narrow in comparison to abelisaurids and bear stout neck ribs. While many theropods have s-shaped necks, the ribs would make the neck rather stiff in Masiakasaurus, and the back of the neck is positioned almost horizontally, giving it only a slighter curve. Like those of other abelisauroids, the vertebrae are heavily pneumaticized, or hollowed, and have relatively short neural spines. Pneumaticity is limited to the neck and foremost back vertebrae, however. Pneumatic cavities are also present in the braincase. = Forelimbs = As in other ceratosaurs, the shoulder blade (scapula) and shoulder girdle (coracoid) fuse into a single bone, the scapulocoracoid. This bone is very large and broad, even compared to the condition in other ceratosaurs. The scapula portion (above the glenoid, or arm socket) tapers towards the back while the coracoid portion (below the glenoid) is expanded into a curved blade-like structure. While abelisaurids have arms that are extremely reduced in size, Masiakasaurus and other noasaurids had longer forelimbs. The humerus (upper arm bone) is slender and known bones of the hand are relatively short. The related genus Noasaurus has a large and curved raptorial ungual (claw) which was originally interpreted as a sickle-like foot claw as in dromaeosaurids such as Velociraptor. More recently, this has been re-evaluated as a claw of the hand. The penultimate phalanx, the finger bone that immediately precedes the raptorial ungual in Noasaurus, is also known in Masiakasaurus and has a similar appearance. The enlarged ungual, however, is unknown in Masiakasaurus. It is assumed that members of this genus had four fingers, with the middle two fingers being the longest as in other ceratosaurians. History Specimen FMNH PR 2481 Remains of Masiakasaurus have been found in the Late Cretaceous Maevarano Formation in northwestern Madagascar and were first described in the journal Nature in 2001. Fragmentary bones comprising around 40% of the skeleton were collected near the village of Berivotra. Several parts of the skull, including the distinctive teeth, were found. The humerus, pubis, hind limbs, and several vertebrae were also collected. In 2011, additional specimens of Masiakasaurus were described. The braincase, premaxilla, facial bones, ribcage, portions of the hands and pectoral girdle, and much of the cervical and dorsal vertebral column were described for the first time. The discovery of this new material clarified many aspects of noasaurid anatomy and made the genus among the best known dinosaurs. The new finds did however not allow for a detailed study of its evolutionary relationships among ceratosaurs. With the new material, around 65% of the skeleton is currently known. Classification Skeletal restoration showing remains of several specimens In its initial 2001 description, Masiakasaurus was classified as a basal abelisauroid related to Laevisuchus and Noasaurus, two poorly known genera named in 1933 and 1980, respectively. In the following year, Carrano et al. (2002) placed Masiakasaurus along with Laevisuchus and Noasaurus in the family Noasauridae. They conducted a phylogenetic analysis of abelisauroids using characteristics from Masiakasaurus. Below is a cladogram from an updated version of their analysis showing the phylogenetic placement of Masiakasaurus.Rauhut, O.W.M., and Carrano, M.T. (2016). The theropod dinosaur Elaphrosaurus bambergi Janensch, 1920, from the Late Jurassic of Tendaguru, Tanzania. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, (advance online publication) Paleobiology Masiakasaurus scavenges a Rapetosaurus corpse Carrano et al. (2002) distinguished two forms of Masiakasaurus, a robust form and a gracile form. The robust morph includes specimens with thicker bones and more pronounced projections for the attachment of ligaments and muscles. The gracile form includes specimens that are more slender and have less pronounced muscle attachments. It also has unfused tibiae, unlike the fused tibiae of the robust form. These two varieties may be an indication of sexual dimorphism in Masiakasaurus, but they may also represent two distinct populations. One specimen of Masiakasaurus, a right scapulocoracoid, bears holes that may be puncture marks from predation or scavenging. Majungasaurus, a large abelisaurid from the Maevarano Formation, may have preyed upon Masiakasaurus. The holes may also have been the result of an infection. =Diet= Skull diagram The procument front teeth of Masiakasaurus were likely an adaptation for grasping small prey. They would have been unsuitable for tearing larger food apart. In the front of the jaws, carinae are restricted to the base of the teeth and would not have been used to tear prey. The back teeth, however, share the same general characteristics as those of most other theropods, suggesting that they served a similar function in Masiakasaurus such as cutting and slicing. Several feeding behaviors have been proposed for Masiakasaurus on the basis of its unusual dentition. Because the front teeth would have been well suited for grasping, Masiakasaurus may have consumed small vertebrates, invertebrates, and possibly even fruits. =Growth= In 2013, Lee and O'Connor observed that Masiakasaurus would be a good subject for an analysis of theropod growth, considering that there is an abundance of fossil material to examine from a broad range of ontogenetic stages. The study showed that Masiakasaurus grew determinately, and reached full maturity at a small body size. Competing theories that Masiakasaurus specimens represent the juvenile form of a larger-bodied theropod were not supported by the data. Masiakasaurus took 8 to 10 years to grow the size of a large dog. This indicates a rate of growth that is 40% slower than that of comparably sized non-avian theropods, a finding that is supported by the unusual prominence of parallel-fibered bone which is known to be associated with relatively slow growth. However, individuals in this genus grew 40% faster than crocodylians. Lee and O'Connor noted that the evolution of slow growth gave this dinosaur the advantage of minimizing the nutritional investment allocated toward structural growth while living in a semiarid and seasonally stressful environment.Andrew H. Lee & Patrick M. O’Connor (2013) Bone histology confirms determinate growth and small body size in the noasaurid theropod Masiakasaurus knopfleri. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 33(4): 865-876.

When Gugsa became Ras of Begemder, as mentioned in the contemporary Royal Chronicle and later in Gabra Sellase's chronicle of Menelik's reign, he made his capital at a place called Lebo, a mountainous district some 60 kilometers south-east of Gondar.Richard P.K. Pankhurst, \\"The History of Däbrä Tabor (Ethiopia)\\", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 40, (1977), p. 235 Upon becoming Regent, Ras Gugsa reasserted the central power of the Empire (although keeping the Emperor as a figurehead) by dispossessing the nobility of the parts of Ethiopia he controlled, primarily Begemder. He accomplished this by proclaiming in 1800 in the name of the Emperor the legal title of land tenure would be converted from freeholds to state property, held at the will of the Emperor. At first the peasantry welcomed this egalitarian measure, believing that they would benefit from the loss of their masters. However, as Ras Gugsa proceeded in dispossessing the great families each year under one pretext or another, the peasants lost their last defenders. \\"The dispossessed nobles,\\" writes Pankhurst, \\"meanwhile, almost all became soldiers of fortune. They were so rapacious that sometimes whole villages abandoned their lands and emigrated to neighboring territories, many of the peasantry enrolling in the army, as they preferred the perils and independence of a military life to the servitude of the field.\\"Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia, 1800-1935 (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University Press, 1968), pp. 137ff. In 1803, Ras Gugsa entered into the ongoing doctrinal disputes that divided the Ethiopian Church by joining the Ichege Wolde Yona in expelling the advocates of the Qebat from Begemder.

He was one of six quartermasters on board the vessel and was at the ship's wheel when the Titanic struck the iceberg. He was in charge of Lifeboat #6, where he refused to return to rescue people from the water according to several accounts of those on the boat, including Margaret Brown, who argued with him throughout the early morning.

Titanic  Hichens gained notoriety after the disaster because of his conduct in Lifeboat No. 6, of which he was in command. Passengers accused him of refusing to go back to rescue people from the water after the ship sank, that he called the people in the water \\"stiffs,\\" and that he constantly criticised those at the oars while he was manning the rudder. Hichens was later to testify at the US Inquiry that he had never used the words \\"stiffs\\" and that he had other words to describe bodies. He would also testify to have been given direct orders by second mate Charles Lightoller and Captain Edward Smith to row to where a light could be seen (a steamer they thought) on the port bow, drop off the passengers and return.

At least two boat 6 passengers publicly accused Hichens of being drunk: Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen and Mrs Lucian Philip Smith. When the came to rescue Titanics survivors he said that the ship was not there to rescue them, but to pick up the bodies of the dead. By this time the other people in the lifeboat had lost patience with Hichens. Although Hichens protested, Denver millionaire Margaret \\"Molly\\" Brown told the others to start rowing to keep warm. After a last attempt by Hichens to keep control of the lifeboat, Brown threatened to throw him overboard. These events would later end up being depicted in the Broadway musical and film, The Unsinkable Molly Brown. During the US inquiry into the disaster, Hichens denied the accounts by the passengers and crew in lifeboat 6. He had been initially concerned about the suction from the Titanic and later by the fact that being a mile away from the wreck, with no compass and in complete darkness, they had no way of returning to the stricken vessel. Later life Hichens served with the Army Service Corps during World War One; by 1919 he was third officer on a small ship named Magpie. The Hichens moved to Devon sometime in the 1920s where Robert purchased a motor boat from a man named Harry Henley and operated a boat charter. In 1931, his wife and children left him and moved to Southampton. In 1933, Hichens was jailed for attempting to murder Henley and was released in 1937. Death On 23 September 1940, at age 58, Hichens died of heart failure aboard the ship English Trader, while it was moored off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland. His body was buried in Section 10, Lair 244 of Trinity Cemetery, in Aberdeen. Depicted in fiction Hichens' conduct was featured in the 1997 blockbuster, Titanic, in which he was played by Paul Brightwell. He was depicted as a tall thin man with a cockney accent, when in fact he was 5' 6\\", had a stocky build and spoke with a pronounced Cornish accent. He was also depicted saying \\"if you don't shut that hole in your face\\" to Molly Brown, but in fact those words were spoken by a steward in lifeboat 8. Hichens' conduct was also depicted in the 1996 miniseries Titanic, in which he was played by Martin Evans. Hichens is shown telling the survivors in his lifeboat to \\"pipe down\\" when they get excited about spotting a flare from a ship on the horizon. He strongly protests when Molly Brown starts encouraging the other women to row towards the light, and she threatens to throw Hichens overboard. This depiction is more accurate than in the 1997 blockbuster. Hichens was portrayed by Arthur Gross who was uncredited in the 1958 film A Night to Remember, which also portrays his conflict with Molly Brown in a more accurate manner. Hichens' negative attitude was further depicted in Diane Hoh's 1998 romance novel Titanic: The Long Night, which recounts his conduct as well as that of Molly Brown, from the viewpoint of Elizabeth Farr, a fictional lifeboat passenger. Molly Brown urged lifeboat passengers to start rowing to keep warm, and Hichens protested, declaring that he was commanding the lifeboat, and he made a move to stop her. \\"I will throw you overboard if you interfere,\\" she told him in this account. In September 2010, Hichens' name was brought back into the limelight by Louise Patten, granddaughter of the most senior officer to have survived the Titanic disaster, second officer Charles Lightoller. In press interviews leading up to the publication of her latest novel, Good as Gold (into which she has worked the story of the catastrophe), Patten reports that a \\"straightforward\\" steering error by Hichens, brought about by his misunderstanding of a tiller order, caused the Titanic to hit an iceberg in 1912. Patten's allegation that Hichens caused the disaster by turning the ship's wheel the wrong way is not supported by testimony at both the British and US enquiries, which established that the second watch officer, Sixth Officer James Moody, was stationed behind Hichens, supervising his actions, and he had confirmed to First Officer William Murdoch that the order had been carried out correctly.Maltin, Tim; Aston, Eloise (2010). 101 Things You Thought You Knew About the Titanic...But Didn't London: Beautiful Books. , page 89United States Senate Enquiry: Testimony of Alfred Olliver The claim was also disputed by Hichens' great-granddaughter on Channel 4 News. Sally Nilsson explained that Hichens was a well-trained Quartermaster with years of experience steering large vessels. He had been responsible on his watch for steering the Titanic for four days before the collision and would not have made such a glaring error. As to the steering orders, in 1912 they were as follows: There was only one way of giving steering orders. The order was always given with reference to the tiller. To go to port the Officer ordered starboard. The Quartermaster turned the wheel to port, tiller went to starboard and the ship turned to port. This was a hangover from the old days when ships were steered with tillers, steering oars etc. The change in steering orders did not occur until the 1930s. Sally Nilsson's biography on the life of Robert Hichens was published in 2011. Hichens also appears in the play Iceberg – Right Ahead! by Chris Burgess which debuted on 22 March 2012 at Upstairs at the Gatehouse. In this production, he was played by Liam Mulvey.

It is both a sign of awe as well as decoration and protection of the altar and the sacred vessels. In the orthodox churches is covered by the antimension, which also contains the relics of saints. Since the 2nd century the altar cloth has been seen as a symbol for the shroud of Jesus Christ; therefore it should be made of white linen. Another interpretation used two cloths and compared them with the body and soul of Christ.  Christian altar cloths Western Churches= The High Altar at St. John the Divine, Kennington, London. Special cloths (not necessarily made of linen) cover the altar in many Christian churches during services and celebrations, and are often left on the altar when it is not in use. In the early 20th century the Roman Catholic Church considered only linen or hemp to be acceptable as material for altar cloths, although in earlier centuries silk or cloth of gold or silver were used. The Anglican Communion had similar rules in that period. At that time, the Roman Rite required the use of three altar cloths, to which a cere cloth, not classified as an altar cloth, was generally added. This was a piece of heavy linen treated with wax (cera, from which \\"cere\\" is derived, is the Latin word for \\"wax\\") to protect the altar linens from the dampness of a stone altar, and also to prevent the altar from being stained by any wine that may be spilled. It was exactly the same size as the mensa (the flat rectangular top of the altar). Above this were placed two linen cloths. Like the cere cloth, they were made of heavy linen exactly the same size as the mensa of the altar. They acted as a cushion and, with the cere cloth, prevented the altar from being dented by heavy vases or communion vessels placed on top. Instead of two cloths, a single long cloth folded so that each half covered the whole mensa was acceptable. The topmost cloth was the fair linen, a long white linen cloth laid over the two linen cloths. It had the same depth as the mensa of the altar, but was longer, generally hanging over the edges to within a few inches of the floor or, according to some authorities, it should hang 18 inches over the ends of the mensa. On an altar without antependium and consisting of the mensa resting on columns or made after the fashion of a tomb the topmost linen did not have to overhang the edges at the sides. It could be trimmed with lace on the ends and could be ornamented with figures of chalices, hosts and the like. Five small crosses might be embroidered on the fair linen - one to fall at each corner of the mensa, and one in the middle of the front edge. These symbolised the five wounds of Jesus. The fair linen should be left on the altar at all times. When removed for replacement, it should be rolled, not folded. It symbolized the shroud in which Jesus was wrapped for burial. *A vesperal cloth, or coverlet, of the same heavy linen as the cere cloth and the linen cloths, and of the same length and width as the fair linen, was left on the altar whenever it is not in use. It simply protects the altar from dust and debris. The present rules of the Roman Rite are much less detailed, stating only: Chalice cloths A purificator laid on a chalice A pall, embroidered with the Agnus Dei A chalice veil laid over the holy vessels burse There are also special linens which pertain to the Eucharist: *The purificator (purificatorium or more anciently emunctorium) is a white linen cloth which is used to wipe the chalice after each communicant partakes. It is also used to dry the fingers and the lips of the celebrant and to wipe the chalice and paten after the ablutions which follow Communion. *The pall (palla) is a stiffened square card covered with white linen, usually embroidered with a cross, or some other appropriate symbol. The purpose of the pall is to keep dust and insects from falling into the Eucharistic elements. *The corporal is a square white cloth upon which the chalice and paten are placed when the Eucharist is celebrated. It may be edged with fine lace, and a cross may be embroidered on it near the front edge, where the Tridentine Mass prescribed that the host be placed. Embroidery in the centre was not used, lest the chalice become unstable. *The manuterge (also called lavabo towel) is used by the priest to dry his hands after washing them (see lavabo). *The chalice veil: \\"It is a praiseworthy practice for the chalice to be covered with a veil, which may be either of the colour of the day or white.\\"General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 118 *In the Tridentine Mass, the rubrics for Low Mass form obliged the priest to begin by carrying with him from the sacristy to the altar the chalice, upon which was placed the purificator, paten and pall, all of these covered with a chalice veil and surmounted by a burse (known in Old English as a \\"corporas- case\\") containing the corporal. The burse was a folder made of two square pieces of cardboard laid one on top of the other and bound together along one edge to form a hinge. The two pieces were attached with cloth along the two sides adjacent to the hinge, leaving the fourth end open to receive the corporal. At the end of Mass, the priest carried all these back to the sacristy, arranged after the same fashion. The present General Instruction of the Roman Missal does not envisage the use of a burse. Frontals In the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion all of the linen cloths are white, including their decoration. Other more decorative cloths sometimes used to decorate the front and back of the altar are: *The frontal, or Antependium, is the same size as the front of the altar. It is richly decorated, made of tapestry, silk or damask. Some frontals are matchless works of art, exhibiting the finest materials and embroidery possible. Other churches opt for a plain frontal. One characteristic is shared by all frontals: they are coloured green, red, purple, blue, black, white, gold or of unbleached muslin, and are changed according to the colour of the Church year. Purple or blue for Advent; white or gold for Christmas, Easter and some Holy Days; green for Ordinary Time (after Epiphany and Pentecost); violet or purple or unbleached muslin for Lent; red for Holy Week, Pentecost and feasts of martyred saints (in some Anglican parishes there is a special crimson set for Holy Week). In this way the altar has various different frontals hung upon it throughout the year, but only one at a time. The frontal may be fixed to either the cere cloth or the linen cloth to hold it in place, which cloth must be fastened to the rear edge of the altar. *The frontlet is similar to the frontal, that is the exact width of the altar, but only ten to twelve inches deep. It hangs over the frontal, and is of the same colour and material. Again, the frontlet is rotated according to the colour of the church year. Like the frontal the frontlet is fastened to either the cere cloth or the linen cloth. Or, alternatively, it may be fastened to a wooden frame or strip that can be hooked in place at the front of the altar.  Variants  According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, altar-cloths were commonly used prior to the 4th century. Pope Boniface III is reputed to have passed a decree in the 7th century making the use of altar cloths mandatory. The use of three cloths most likely began in the 9th century and was obligatory for Roman Catholic churches at the time of the Catholic Encyclopedia. Previously, all Christian Churches used altar cloths. However, today some use no cloths on the altar or only the fair linen. Several variants of the above cloths and linens are also in use. Some Churches use a frontlet and no frontal, especially where the altar is richly decorated and a frontal would hide it. Where only a frontlet is used, in many cases the frontlet is permanently attached to the linen cloth, and so the linen cloth must be replaced with the frontlet. Many Churches dispense with the cere cloth and the coverlet. Many churches of the Anglican Communion follow the tradition of the Latin Church in preparing the altar for the Eucharist. There are varying practices in the Episcopal Church; some do not use the elaborate altar dressing previously laid down for the Roman Catholic Church and usually use only a white fair linen cloth to cover the top of the altar. According to a glossary found on an Episcopal parish's website, the altar cloth they use \\"... covers the top of the altar and hangs down the sides almost to the floor.\\" Lutherans also use a single fair linen on their altar, though many use the coloured frontlet or frontal as well. Likewise, The Doctrines and Discipline of the Methodist Church specifies that \\"The Lord's Table should have upon it a fair linen cloth.\\" =Eastern Churches= A Russian Orthodox priest celebrating Divine Liturgy. On the Holy Table (altar) is a green indítia, and the Antimens (gold) with its eileton (red) has been opened. In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine Rite, the altar is referred to as the Holy Table or Throne (Church Slavonic: Prestol). Although there are variations, normally it will be completely covered on all four sides with three clothes. *The Strachítsa is the first cloth to cover the Holy Table. It is a plain linen cover which is bound to the altar with cords at the time of its consecration, and is never removed. This linen covering symbolizes the winding sheet in which the body of Christ was wrapped when he was laid in the tomb. Since the altar is never seen uncovered thereafter, these tend to be constructed more with sturdiness than aesthetics in mind. *The Indítia is placed above this first cover and is an ornamented cover, often in a brocade of a color that may change with the liturgical season. This outer covering usually comes all the way to the floor and represents the glory of God's Throne.Isabel Hapgood. Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church (Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese, 1975), p. xxix. When the Indítia is laid out flat it forms a Greek cross, with the center covering the top of the Holy Table, and the \\"arms\\" of the cross covering the four sides. *A third covering is made of the same material as the Indítia, but is smaller and square, covering the top of the Holy Table and coming down only a few inches on all four sides, something like the Western frontlet. The Antimension (Church Slavonic: Antimens) is similar to the Western corporal, though it serves a function similar to an altar stone. It is a piece of silk or linen which has an icon of the Deposition from the Cross depicted on it, and relics of a martyr sewn into it. Unlike the Western corporal, the Antimension is not removed from the Holy Table after the Eucharist is over, but is kept in the center of the Holy Table, covered by the Gospel Book. The Antimension is wrapped in a slightly larger cloth, called the Eiliton to protect it. The Eiliton is often red. The diskos and chalice covered by the Aër at the conclusion of the Proskomedie. The Eastern chalice veil is called the Aër and is quite a bit larger than the chalice veil used in the West. In addition to the Aër, there are two other smaller veils. These are often cross-shaped like the Indítia and one is used to cover the chalice, and one is used to cover the diskos (paten). There are usually one or two communion cloths (houselling cloths) kept on the Holy Table. These are made of cotton or some similar material that can be easily washed and are often dyed red. They are used like the Western purificator to wipe the lips of the communicants and to dry the chalice and other sacred vessels after the ablutions. A dust cover is frequently used, either to cover only the Gospel Book or the entire top of the Holy Table. This cover is not, strictly speaking, a liturgical object, but is purely utilitarian. Because it will rest upon the Holy Table, it is usually made of a fair material, but not normally as rich as the inditia. Towels are used to dry the hands after lavabo, though their design and use are not as fixed as formerly in the West. When a bishop washes his hands, a larger and more ornate towel is used to dry his hands.  Judaism  According to the Bible the Jews were using altar cloths at the time of the Exodus, \\"...And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense ... and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot, and the cloths of service...\\" () The Jews traditionally used colour, \\"And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service...\\" which were to be used by the priests inside the tabernacle. Since all of the other items made from fabric for use in the tabernacle were made from fine linen it is reasonable to assume that the cloths of service were also made from linen.() Unfortunately, Exodus does not give the dimensions of the cloths, nor does it indicate how or when the cloths were to be used. The practice of using altar cloths disappeared when the Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in AD 70. The focus of worship turned towards the synagogue and the need for an altar disappeared. There is a table where the Torah scrolls are laid for reading, called a bimah, and another lower table called an amud, that is, a lectern. The lectern is covered with an embroidered cloth covering the area on which the Torah scroll will rest during the parashah (lection—see Torah reading). The Torah ark in the synagogue is covered with a cloth called the parokhet to recall the veil which covered the entrance to the Holy of Holies.

The name is also often used to denote the immediately surrounding area. Heartland Village is located within the New Springville neighborhood of Staten Island. The development itself occupies a square-shaped area bounded by Richmond Avenue, Rockland Avenue, Richmond Hill Road, and Forest Hill Road, exclusive of the various shopping centers also located therein. The Staten Island Mall is located south of Richmond Hill Road. Heartland Village's proximity to the Staten Island Mall and many other smaller shopping centers nearby has made it one of the island's most attractive residential communities; indeed, the region has emerged as the island's second largest commercial and administrative hub, after St. George. History New Springville was originally a rural and wooded community. The construction of the Verrazzano- Narrows Bridge (opened in 1964) led to the establishment on Staten Island of many large residential development communities. One of the largest development communities to emerge was the Heartland Village community. Construction of the Heartland Village Community started in the late 1960s and would continue through the early 1980s. Most of the homes in Heartland Village consist of two family homes with six or seven rooms in the main home, with three bedrooms. These are medium-sized homes. In recent years, with most new construction has been focused on larger homes or condominiums, these medium-sized homes have become particularly desirable. Education With the increasing residential population, a need arose for new schools to be built in the community. In 1976, two such schools opened: An elementary school, P.S. 69, the Daniel D. Tompkins School and I.S. 72, the Rocco Laurie Intermediate School. Transportation Heartland Village is served by various local and express buses. The local buses and express buses travel along Richmond Avenue. The local buses and express buses run along Travis Avenue and Merry Mount Street.

Definitions A connected dominating set of a graph G is a set D of vertices with two properties: #Any node in D can reach any other node in D by a path that stays entirely within D. That is, D induces a connected subgraph of G. #Every vertex in G either belongs to D or is adjacent to a vertex in D. That is, D is a dominating set of G. A minimum connected dominating set of a graph G is a connected dominating set with the smallest possible cardinality among all connected dominating sets of G. The connected domination number of G is the number of vertices in the minimum connected dominating set.. Any spanning tree T of a graph G has at least two leaves, vertices that have only one edge of T incident to them. A maximum leaf spanning tree is a spanning tree that has the largest possible number of leaves among all spanning trees of G. The max leaf number of G is the number of leaves in the maximum leaf spanning tree.. Complementarity If d is the connected domination number of an n-vertex graph G, where n > 2, and l is its max leaf number, then the three quantities d, l, and n obey the simple equation :\\\\displaystyle n = d + l.. If D is a connected dominating set, then there exists a spanning tree in G whose leaves include all vertices that are not in D: form a spanning tree of the subgraph induced by D, together with edges connecting each remaining vertex v that is not in D to a neighbor of v in D. This shows that In the other direction, if T is any spanning tree in G, then the vertices of T that are not leaves form a connected dominating set of G. This shows that Putting these two inequalities together proves the equality Therefore, in any graph, the sum of the connected domination number and the max leaf number equals the total number of vertices. Computationally, this implies that determining the connected domination number is equally difficult as finding the max leaf number. Algorithms It is NP-complete to test whether there exists a connected dominating set with size less than a given threshold, or equivalently to test whether there exists a spanning tree with at least a given number of leaves. Therefore, it is believed that the minimum connected dominating set problem and the maximum leaf spanning tree problem cannot be solved in polynomial time. When viewed in terms of approximation algorithms, connected domination and maximum leaf spanning trees are not the same: approximating one to within a given approximation ratio is not the same as approximating the other to the same ratio. There exists an approximation for the minimum connected dominating set that achieves a factor of , where Δ is the maximum degree of a vertex in G.. The maximum leaf spanning tree problem is MAX-SNP hard, implying that no polynomial time approximation scheme is likely.. However, it can be approximated to within a factor of 2 in polynomial time.. Both problems may be solved, on -vertex graphs, in time .. The maximum leaf problem is fixed-parameter tractable, meaning that it can be solved in time exponential in the number of leaves but only polynomial in the input graph size. The klam value of these algorithms (intuitively, a number of leaves up to which the problem can be solved within a reasonable amount of time) has gradually increased, as algorithms for the problem have improved, to approximately 37,. and it has been suggested that at least 50 should be achievable.. In graphs of maximum degree three, the connected dominating set and its complementary maximum leaf spanning tree problem can be solved in polynomial time, by transforming them into an instance of the matroid parity problem for linear matroids. Applications Connected dominating sets are useful in the computation of routing for mobile ad hoc networks. In this application, a small connected dominating set is used as a backbone for communications, and nodes that are not in this set communicate by passing messages through neighbors that are in the set.. The max leaf number has been employed in the development of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms: several NP-hard optimization problems may be solved in polynomial time for graphs of bounded max leaf number.

She began working in the 1950s and her first compositions were presented in the late 1960s. Until 2000 her work was almost exclusively created with the ARP 2500 modular synthesizer and tape. Since 2001 she has composed mainly for acoustic instruments.Joanna Demers Listening through the Noise: The Aesthetics of Experimental ... 2010, p. 94: \\"The work of Éliane Radigue quickly puts to rest suspicions that all drones sound like Young's. Radigue is a French electronic-music composer who studied with Schaeffer and Pierre Henry in the 1950s before trading musique concrète for a ...\\" Biography Radigue was born in a modest family of merchants and raised in Paris at Les Halles. She later married the French-born American artist Arman with whom she lived in Nice while raising their three children, before returning to Paris in 1967. She had studied piano and was already composing before hearing a broadcast by the founder of musique concrète Pierre Schaeffer. She soon met him, and in the early '50s became his student, working periodically at the Studio d'Essai during visits to Paris. In the early 1960s, she was assistant to Pierre Henry, creating some of the sounds which appeared in his works. As her own work matured, Schaeffer and Henry felt that her use of microphone feedback and long tape loops (as heard in Vice-Versa and Feedback Works 1969-1970) was moving away from their ideals, though her singular practice was still related to their methods. Career 1955-1957: Apprenticeship in Music Concrète = Radigue's initial education on electroacoustic music was from composer Pierre Schaeffer, whom she was introduced via radio broadcasts of his music. After meeting him in person through a mutual friend, Radigue started her music education under Schaeffer and Pierre Henry at Studio d'Essai de la Radiodiffusion Nationale in Paris on 1955. At the institution, Radigue was trained on tape music techniques as a part of her education in Music Concréte. Radigue described the experience as eye-opening, as it introduced her to the idea that any sounds were able to be considered musical. However, she also described her early music to be paralleled from the practice as both of her educators disfavored electronic music over Music Concrète principles. = 1960s: Tape Feedback = Radigue left Studio d'Essai due to the need to support her children's education. As she lost access to studios and equipment, she pursued music education on classical composition, harp, and piano. In 1967, Radigue reconnected with Pierre Henry and started to work as his assistant at Studio Apsome. During this time, she developed particular interest in tape feedback technique, as it fit her sonic vision of minuscule developments over an extended time. A year left, Radigue resigned and started her professional music career, primarily working within the tape editing medium. = 1970s-1990s: Experiments with Synthesizers = Around 1970, Radigue created her first synthesizer-based music in a studio she shared with Laurie Spiegel on a Buchla synthesizer installed by Morton Subotnick at NYU. (Chry-ptus dates from this time.) Her goal at this point was to create a slow, purposeful \\"unfolding\\" of sound through the use of analogue synthesizers and magnetic tape, with results she felt to be closer to the minimal composers of New York at the time than to the French musique concrète composers who had been her previous allies. She experimented with Buchla and Moog synthesizers before finding in the ARP 2500 synthesizer the vehicle she would use exclusively for the next 25 years in forging her characteristic sound, beginning with Adnos I (1974). After that work's premiere at Mills College at the invitation of Robert Ashley, a group of visiting French music students suggested that her music was deeply related to meditation and that she should look into Tibetan Buddhism, two fields she was not familiar with. =Buddhist influence= After investigating Tibetan Buddhism, she quickly converted and spent the next three years devoted to its practice under her guru Pawo Rinpoche, who subsequently sent her back to her musical work. She returned to composition, picking up where she left off, using the same working methods and goals as before, finishing Adnos II in 1979 and Adnos III in 1980. Then came a series of works dedicated to Milarepa,\\"Éliane Radigue, Mining Wisdom From 11th-Century Buddhism by Ben Ratliff, The New York Times, 20 August 2015 the great Tibetan yogi, known for his Hundred Thousand Songs representing the basis of his teaching. First she composed the Songs of Milarepa, followed by Jetsun Mila, an evocation of the life of this great master; the creation of these works was sponsored by the French government. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she devoted herself to a singular three-hour work, perhaps her masterpiece, the Trilogie de la Mort, of which the first part kyema Intermediate states follows the path of the continuum of the six states of consciousness. The work was influenced as much by the Tibetan Book of the Dead Bardo Thodol and her meditation practice, as by the deaths of Pawo Rinpoche and of her son . The first third of the Trilogie, \\"Kyema\\", was her first recording to be released on Phill Niblock's XI label. =2000s-Present: Acoustic era= In 2000, she made her last electronic work in Paris, l'Ile Re- sonante, for which she received the Golden Nica Award at the festival Ars Electronica in 2006. In 2001, on request from electric bassist and composer Kasper T. Toeplitz, she created her first instrumental work, Elemental II, which she took up again with The Lappetites, a laptop improvisation group. She participated in their first album Before the Libretto on the Quecksilber label in 2005. Since 2004 she has dedicated herself to works for acoustic instruments. First with the American cellist Charles Curtis, the first part of Naldjorlak was premiered in December 2005 in New York and later played in 25 concerts across the U.S. and Europe. The second part of Naldjorlak for the two basset horn players Carol Robinson and Bruno Martinez, was created in September 2007 at the Aarau Festival (Switzerland). The three musicians completed the third part of Naldjorlak with Radigue and premiered the complete work, \\"Naldjorlak I,II,III\\", in Bordeaux on January 24, 2009. In June 2011 her composition for solo harp Occam I, written for the harpist Rhodri Davies, was premiered in London. Numerous solos and ensemble pieces in the OCCAM cycle have followed.

It is the third video game starring Firebrand (an enemy character from the Ghosts 'n Goblins series, known as \\"Red Arremer\\" in the Japanese version), following Gargoyle's Quest and Gargoyle's Quest II. Plot The game's story revolves around the Crests, six magical stones which preside over their respective elements (Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Time and Heaven). When all crests are combined, the Crest of Infinity will appear, allowing its holder infinite power and the ability to conquer all realms with it. The demons of the Demon Realm have long fought each other for possession of the Crests, five of which have since fallen into the hands of a red demon named Firebrand. Seeking infinite power, Firebrand challenges a Demon Dragon for the Crest of Heaven and is victorious, though badly wounded. In his weakness, a rival demon named Phalanx ambushes Firebrand and takes all the Crests except the Fire Crest which shattered into five shards. As the game begins, Phalanx has already begun using the Crests to become the ruler of the Demon Realm, while Firebrand is imprisoned in an amphitheater and made to fight the zombified Demon Dragon. After escaping the amphitheater, Firebrand sets out to regain the Crests and get revenge on Phalanx. Along the way, Firebrand is repeatedly challenged by Phalanx's general, Arma, who grudgingly returns each of the Crests to Firebrand out of respect for his power. Finally, Firebrand challenges Phalanx in his castle within the Demon Realm. Depending on the player's choices, three different endings are possible in this battle. The worst ending has Firebrand killing Phalanx and leaving the Demon Realm as it falls into complete anarchy, while a more favorable ending has Phalanx sealing himself inside the Crest of Heaven and Firebrand hiding all the Crests. The third ending concludes with Firebrand slaying Phalanx after he summons the Crest of Infinity to transform into a hideous beast, then tossing the Crests off a cliff after deciding that he does not seek conquest. Completing the game with the third ending gives the player a special password that allows Firebrand to continue the game with a new transformation, the Ultimate Gargoyle, which allows him to challenge a secret boss named Dark Demon. Upon winning this battle, a new ending plays in which Firebrand casts away the Crests out of pride for his own power, then leaves to seek another worthy opponent to fight. Gameplay The gameplay is a mix of standard platforming, with mild RPG elements. The stages are divided into six main areas and can be played multiple times. Often, the player has to revisit a level with new Crests to access areas, items, and bosses that could not be accessed before. There is also a world map players use to navigate. Firebrand's main abilities are his fire breath, claws for clinging onto walls, and wings to hover in the air (though he cannot gain height early in the game). As he collects Crests, Firebrand can transform and gain new powers that are specialized for combat and exploration: Ground Gargoyle, Aerial Gargoyle, Tidal Gargoyle, Legendary Gargoyle, and Ultimate Gargoyle. Other items to collect include extra hit points, flasks and spell vellums for using consumable magic items, and talismans that can improve Firebrand's abilities. Release Demon's Crest was released in Japan on October 21, 1994. It was followed by a release in North America in November 1994. In 2014, Demon's Crest was re-released on Nintendo's Virtual Console. In 2017, it was released for the 3DS Virtual Console. It is available for the Nintendo Switch with the console's online subscription service. Reception GamePro criticized the repetitive music and lack of variety in enemy attacks, but praised the macabre graphics and complexity of the gameplay, particularly the use of the acquired abilities. They summarized that \\"Demon's Crest brings depth and artistry to the action/adventure genre, making it one of the season's top SNES games\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly scored it an 8.25 out of 10, with their four reviewers applauding the game's beautiful graphics and complex gameplay. Japanese video game magazine Famitsu gave it a score of 28 out of 40. Next Generation gave it a score of 3 out of 5, noting that the game is very short, and that most secret items are not needed to complete the game. Joypad gave it a 79%. Nintendo Power praised the game, noting \\"excellent graphics, play control and game balance and sound\\".

Enlace rescatado el 7 de febrero de 2016 de http://www.comune.amalfi.sa.it/origini.asp?p=1  History  Pre-Colombian time = The position of Amalfi between the last edges of the Andes to its north and the slopes to the Caribbean region, made it a human corridor of ancient migrations. Native Americans were present in what is today modern Colombia since about 15 thousand years ago. In the region of the municipality of Amalfi there are archeological traces dated 9 thousand years ago related to the cultures of Yamesíes, Guamocoes and Tahamíes.Álvarez, Manuel José (1993). Amalfi 1987. Ed. Vieco y Cía, Amalfi, 1987. Segunda edición agosto de 1993. Although those peoples are considered today extinct, their descendants survived in the mestizo population of the region, as well as ancient traditions, names, believes and myths like the Jaguar cult, the petroglyphs, words and other elements that are object of current anthropological and archaeological studies. = Land of pioneers = The territory of the modern municipality of Amalfi was not of much interest for the Spaniards during the three centuries of colonial rule (16th to 18th centuries) as it was in neighbouring regions such as Segovia, Remedios and Yolombó, attracted by their rich gold mines. In 1580 the Spaniard conqueror of Antioquia, Don Gaspar de Rodas, made an excursion to the region following the Porce and Nechi rivers, but he did not make Spanish foundations. He would established the town of Zaragoza in 1581, while searching for a connection with the Magdalena River. During the 18th century groups of traders from Cartagena de Indias, Santa Marta and Mompox settled on the Lower Cauca of Antioquia searching for gold and founded the first town in the today Amalfi territory known as Cancán that is today known as Corregimiento de Portachuelo. They built a Catholic church and some persons lived there, depending their administration from Zaragoza, but it was abandoned few years later. After the Independence of Antioquia, General Julián Trujillo, acting governor, tried to recover the old foundation under the name of San Martín town, but it did not attract enough settlers and was abandoned in 1888. During the Antioquean Colonization, families from Rionegro, La Ceja and other towns of the Eastern Antioquia, Medellín, Copacabana, Yarumal, Santa Rosa de Osos and Santa Fe de Antioquia, migrated to the region in search of gold and other opportunities. Among these first Antioquean settlers, came also foreigners, especially German Jews, Arabs from the Middle East, Chinese that were working on the Antioquean Rail Constructions and Nordic Europeans (Norway.) = Official foundation = In 1838 Reverend Father José Santamaría y Zola, a Spaniard Catholic priest from Málaga, Spain that was living in Copacabana, led an expedition of families that were looking for new opportunities around the mine golds. They founded a town at the Riachón River Valley that was concluded in 1843. The first settlers changed the name many times: Riachón, Santa Bárbara, Cueva Santa and Nueva Población. Bishop Juan de la Cruz Gómez Plata made a visit to Italy and he got in love with the Italian town of Amalfi of Salerno. Although it was a town at the side of the Tyrrhenian Sea, very different from the mountain town on the Antioquia's Andes, Bishop Gómez Plata thought that the blue skies of the Italian town resembled that of the Antioquean one. For this reason he decided to give that Italian name to the new settlement of gold miners to be called Amalfi-Antioquia. A Swedish migrant into the region, engineer and geographer, Carlos Segismundo de Greiff (1793-1870), made his contribution with the design of the streets of the new town with professor Antonio Aguilar, a master plan that is preserved and admired for its symmetric distribution on the Riachón Valley. This Swedish Greiff is the first ancestor in Colombia of the Greiff family that generated remarkable characters such as poet León de Greiff (1895–1976), musician and journalist Otto de Greiff (1903-1995), politician Gustavo de Greiff Restrepo (1929-), lawyer Mónica de Greiff (1956-) and historian Jorge Arias de Greiff (1922-).

Part of the subregion of Northern Antioquia.It is a little town, in the middle of the Andes.It borders on the north with the municipalities of Yarumal and Anorí, on the east with Anorí, on the south with the municipality of Angostura, and on the west with Yarumal. Campamento is known as Cradle of Independence of Antioquia. The name Campamento surely comes from the fact that the area was used as a camp by muleteers traveling between the north and northeast region of Antioquia History In pre-Hispanic times the area was inhabited by the natives of the Nechí and Ituango tribes. In the middle of the 17th century, the north zone of the department began to be populated thanks to its gold wealth. The locality was not populated itself until 1827, the year in which the first settlers arrived from Yarumal. The Campamentño territory was elevated to the category of Parish of the Municipality of Yarumal in 1830. Five years later the locality itself was raised to the status of a municipality by the then governor of Antioquia, Don Juan de Dios Aranzazu, thus separating the locality of the municipality of Yarumal. In 1780 there was a lawsuit between Messrs. Joaquin Barrientos, Plácido Misas and Mr. Antonio De La Quintana who claimed rights over these lands, resolved in 1781 in favor of Messrs Barrientos and Misas, who were thenceforth the owners of Camp grounds and Yarumal. Campamento, which was a parish of Yarumal (decreed 23 April 1835, being governor of Antioquia Aranzazu), took that name in the wake of the Battle of White Chorros, 12 February 1820, in which General Jose Maria Cordova defeated General Francisco Warletta and finished with the last realistic redoubt in Antioquia. The first settlers of Campamento were people of Yarumal who arrived at the site in 1827 by insinuation of the priest of that population, gift Jose Antonio Palace Isaza, who is considered to be the founder. In 1830 the parish was created by request of the city council of Santa Rosa de Osos and in 1835 the population was given the status of municipality by decree of the Governor Juan de Dios Aranzazu. The first church in the municipality was destroyed by a fire and construction of the current one was completed in the middle of the 20th century (probably in 1954). The first telegraphic line between Yarumal and Campamento was established in 1897. Electric light reached the municipality in 1939. In 1943 the road that connects Yarumal with Campamento was brought into service.

Part of the subregion of Northern Antioquia. Bordered to the north by the municipality of Santa Rosa de Osos, to the east by the municipalities of Santa Rosa de Osos and Santo Domingo, to the south by the municipality of Barbosa, and to the west by the municipality of San Pedro de los Milagros. History Since 1624 the Don Matías territory was occupied by settlers from the city of Santa Fe de Antioquia. In 1750 the places San Andrés, Las Ánimas, Las Juntas, La Chorrera began to be populated, and today it forms the urban population. This occupation was the result of new government policies by the crown of Borbón, which the visitor Mon y Velarde applied in Antioquia, seeking the establishment of agricultural colonies in the north of the province. Those who occupied the present territory of Don Matías were basically mazamorreros, independent miners, who were awarded the title of their plots. The municipality has had three names: Azuero, San Antonio Infante and Don Matías. The latter, Don Matías was chosen in 1787 in honor of Don Matías Jaramillo, a man who had a rich mining settlement in the territory where the population now lives. The garment industry in the town was established in the 60s, thanks to the decentralization of manufacturing industries in the city of Medellín. In this way came to the township of Don Matías the industrial clothing company, which almost exclusively produced for a company called Caribou. Thus, the community found a source of employment, as the municipality for those years was basically agrarian. A decade later garment factories began to emerge where those industrial garment company workers, having learned the trade, decided to start their own small industries. Today Don Matías has extensive national and international recognition. One of its main attractions is the Riogrande Dam. Demographics Total Population: 19,458 hab.

The founders were José Antonio Isaza y Atuesta, Lucas de Ochoa y Tirado, and Vicente Restrepo. Some researchers suggest that its name comes from the large trees that were once found there and which were used for the rafters (vigas) in constructing houses. Spaniards in search of gold arrived in the Aburrá Valley for the first time in August of the year 1541. They left only a month after to continue their quest for gold, but returned 90 years later, at the beginning of the 17th century, to stay. The rural Envigado was inhabited by wealthy Spanish families, which lived in prosperous residences that produced nourishment for Antioquia for about 150 years. The urban Envigado only appeared after 1775 with the creation of the Santa Gertrudis Parish, which is now in the center of Downtown Envigado known as \\"El Parque de Envigado.\\" On July 10, 2016 Envigado became part of the Metropolitan Area, which brings together the other nine municipalities of the region - Caldas, La Estrella, Sabaneta, Itagüí, Medellín, Bello, Copacabana, Girardota, Barbosa.

In each village the dance will look somewhat different, but the basic structure is essentially the same. The same dance is done in Bulgaria under the name Pravo. The variations below are a collection of steps commonly done by folk dancers throughout the US and as seen done by various groups in Greece. Many variations of the dance exist. In northern Thrace, zonaradikos turns into a fast tsestos. In western Thrace, the dance is led by the males, and the females follow towards the end of the line. As the dance nears the end, the first dancer moves to the centre and the others twist around him, then they \\"untwist\\" and go back to their normal positions.

When the tsestos portion starts, either the entire line does the tsestos steps, or those doing the tsestos steps form a new belt-hold line inside (towards the center) of the original line. Traditionally, some or all of the men would leave the line and the women would either stop and watch or continue the pravo around the men's line. The entire dance is done with the knees bent.

The film follows undercover police officer Lee Hampton, who infiltrates a band of three female convicts authorities allow to escape from prison. The escape is part of a larger plot to uncover a cache of diamonds hidden deep within the swamps of Louisiana. This film is sometimes also known as Cruel Swamp or Swamp Diamonds. The film was financed by the Woolner Brothers, who later helped Corman set up New World Pictures. Plot Three escaped female convicts, along with an undercover policewoman, Lee Hampton, begin a search for stolen diamonds in the Louisiana swamps. The escape, allowed by the authorities, is part of a larger plan by the authorities is to trail the convicts and recover stolen diamonds. When notified that the stolen diamond cache has been recovered by the undercover officer, they plan to rearrest the women and return the diamonds to their rightful owner. The plan fails to work as designed.

R. Goodrich ProductionDevelopment= Corman and his production partner Jim Nicholson were completing a long road trip searching for backers for their movies, often from drive-in theater owners, when they met the Woolner brothers—Lawrence, Bernard and David—who had opened New Orleans' first drive-in theaters. Looking to get into the production business, Corman said, the brothers agreed to help finance Swamp Women for Corman, who returned to Louisiana with his cast and crew for the production. Larry Woolner's wife Betty said her husband \\"was crazy about\\" Corman. Woolner's son Jurt said “A big part of my father’s decision process was whether he could visualize the poster. So you can just imagine a movie called Swamp Women. That laid a very clear exploitation track to follow.” A former Louisian governor owned a large plantation, and invited the filmmakers to make a movie there. (The end credits thanks Mayor De Lesseps Morrison and Police Chief John Dayries of New Orleans and Governor Robert Kennon of Louisiana.) =Shooting= Filming started in October 1955. The film was shot on location in Louisiana near the town of Lacombe,Ed. J. Philip di Franco, The Movie World of Roger Corman, Chelsea House Publishers, 1979 p 8 and was shot in either 10 or 22 days, depending on the source. Jonathan Haze, who worked with Corman a number of times, had a small role in the movie and also worked as a fight co ordinator for the women. He says the Woolner brothers had him arrested and put in prison as a joke, but called them \\"really good people. They played hard-guy, but deep down they were nice. Barney was always in a hurry, while Larry was much more cool and quiet, and not so much of a character.” Beverly Garland, who would go on to make several films with Corman, called the movie: > A terrible thing! Roger put us up in this old, abandoned hotel... I mean, it > was really abandoned!... I'm surprised that the hotel had running water! I > remember that we each had a room with an iron bed. Our first night there, I > went to bed, and I heard this tremendous crash! I went screaming into Marie > Windsor's room, and there she was with the bed on top of her— the whole bed > had collapsed! Well, we started laughing because everything was so awful in > this hotel, just incredibly terrible, and we became good friends. Windsor confirmed this, saying Corman is \\"such a nice guy. but he's sure hard on you out on the location.\\" Mike Connors recalled, \\"the girls in that picture had it much worse than I did. They were playing escaped convicts, and they captured me. They had to trudge through the mud, the swamps, pulling this rowboat, and I was sitting in the rowboat high and dry.\\" However at the end of the film he had to dive into the water which \\"had snakes and stuff in it, and it was just terrible. But to Roger, it was like [shrugs], \\"So you get bit by a snake — big deal!\\"\\" It was a horrendous experience, I'll tell you — just the worst.\\" Connors said he had to do scenes near an alligator in the water (it was tied up) and a rattlesnake which crawled over its leg (its mouth was taped). \\"I had nightmares for weeks after I got back, about that.. .big snake,\\" said Connors. Ed Nelson, later of Peyton Place fame, was living in New Orleans at the time, working as a floor manager for WDSU, when he heard of the film. \\"I had the gut feeling that being a part of the Corman group would boost my career,\\" Nelson said. \\"I was right.\\" Nelson got himself a job behind the scenes on the movie and eventually was cast as a cop as well. Nelson later said, \\"I did everything: I was the location manager, I wrestled the alligator. I held it up in the water so that Mike [Touch] Connors could wrestle it. \\" He added, \\"\\"This included bringing the limited supply of hot water to the almost primitive hotel rooms at the Georgian Manor so the performers and crew could bathe. I made hot coffee for the cast and crew, and maintained a cooler of cold Barq's Root Beer, Louisiana's favorite soft drink, when the heat was at its worst.\\" Wild animals, such as an alligator and a rattlesnake, were hired from Arthur Jones, who then ran a roadside attraction off Highway 11 in Slidell. At the end of the film Garland's character was killed with a spear and fell out of a tree. She recalled: > They got me up in this tree and Roger said, \\"When you're killed, you have to > drop\\"— and this was a big tree! I'm not exaggerating when I say it was at > least a 20-foot drop. I said, \\"Well, will somebody be there?\\" And Roger > said, \\"Yes, they’ll catch you.\\" And by God, they had three guys underneath. > And when they killed me, I just fell— dead weight- on these three poor guys! > Roger said to me, \\"You're really one of the best stuntwomen I have ever > worked with.\\" After making the movie Nelson went to see Corman in Hollywood and went to work for him, doing all sorts of jobs as well as acting. Based on his behind the scenes help and his role, he would go on to appear in about 15 Corman productions. He returned to Louisiana to film another low budget movie, Bayou, shot near Barataria Bay. Reception and legacy The film was released on a double bill with Gunslinger, also directed by Corman with Garland.

The show has been in permanent residence at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, since October 1998. O, whose name is pronounced the same way as eau, the French word for \\"water\\", takes place in, around and above a pool of water, featuring water acts such as synchronized swimming as well as aerial and ground acts. The O theatre, which is designed to resemble a 14th-century European opera house, has 1,800 seats, thus allowing the performance to be watched by 3,600 people a night since the performance usually plays twice in a given day, also designed to meet the special demands of the show. O was inspired by the \\"infinity and elegance of water's pure form,\\" which pays tribute to the beauty of the theatre. A group of 150 stage technicians assist in the production of the show, the cast of which is 85 performers: international acrobats, synchronized swimmers, and divers. Some of them are former Olympic athletes. History Since late October 2010, Cirque du Soleil has offered backstage tours of the O theatre. The experience allows visitors to see the backstage wings, training rooms, costume workshop, break area, underwater lighting area, and go up to a catwalk into the sound and lighting booths. Not every experience will be the same as the tour is conducted around a \\"regular day\\", so performers may or may not be training, rehearsing, or even working out. As of early 2011, O has grossed over a billion dollars since the show opened in 1998. O has received many awards, including the following: * Entertainment Design Award, best production show, 1998 * Las Vegas Review-Journal, best production show, 1999–2006 * THEA, live show category, 1999 * Prix Italia, creativity in high definition, 2009, for the documentary Flow O had its 10,000th performance on 1 September 2019. Set and technical information The show has a cast of 85 acrobats, synchronized swimmers and divers performing in and above a 1.5 million-gallon pool. When maintenance needs to be performed, the pool is drained in about 12 hours to the Bellagio Lake, causing the lake's water level to rise . The pool is kept at and has an underwater speaker system and regulators that allow performers to breathe underwater. Every member of the cast is scuba-certified. The underwater stage lift was produced by Handling Specialty.Handling Specialty Turn Key Capabilities In order for the platform stage to rise and fall in the water without a wake, the rubber surface of the stage is perforated. Cold air vents under each seat help control the theatre temperature for the audience. The goal is to maintain two temperature zones in the theatre: the stage is kept at a higher temperature of 84°F, while the audience area is kept at a lower temperature of 72°F. A mesh false ceiling allows warm moist air to escape out of the top of the theatre. To minimize damage to the musical instruments, the musicians play from glass enclosures in the theatre. Some of the musical instruments used in the show are more than 100 years old. The unique string instrument heard in the soundtrack of O is an erhu, a traditional Chinese bowed string instrument. To maintain a fresh look on the performers, some performers have multiple sets of costumes so they may reappear dry despite having been in the water. Some of the costumes only have a lifespan of approximately 20 shows due to the bromide and chlorine in the water. Additional facts about the show: * Some of the props function as boats, like the umbrella that Le Vieux rides on the water. * There are 15 technicians underwater during the show, performing various tasks such as artist handling and props manipulation. * The horses that the Comets ride in the show weigh . * The clown house weighs over . * Hanging 49 feet above the stage, the carousel and téléphérique (a conveyor system) carry tons of equipment as well as performers during the show. * Most of the props that are used during the show are actually driven by the Performers who ride them. For instance, the carousel horses have a small propeller underneath their tails; they are controlled by a joystick located on the back of the horse. Costumes Costumes for O drew inspiration from many sources: commedia dell'arte, the Baroque, India, the Arabian Nights, as well as Venetian courtly fashions. The costumes' silhouettes are defined by the design and are accentuated by the transparency of the selected materials and fabrics. Many costumes' base design are leotards which are then expounded upon: this includes the Zebras and Flayed Ones, among others. The Flayed Ones' leotards, for example, originally had hand-painted muscles on them, as digital screen-printing was inaccessible at the time of creation. Another special attribute critical to costumes in O is their treatment to help withstand the water and chemicals in it. To achieve this feat, roughly 40% of the costumes have been applied with a specific type of silicon sizing. In addition, the materials chosen are more durable and had to be able to both mould to the performer's body and dry quickly. Over the years the best fabric found for the costumes has been nylon mesh, which performs well either wet or dry. Additional facts regarding the costumes: * A separate room was built with timed heaters and fans to air-dry many of the costumes which cannot be tumble-dried. * Sixty loads of laundry are done nightly to wash the costumes which can be machine washed. * The swimmers' costumes are replaced every 3 months. * The Comets' costumes last for a full year. *All wigs and headpieces had to have chinstraps added. Music The music of O was composed by Benoit Jutras and features a mix of classical Western and world instrumentation, including Chinese violin (erhu), bagpipes, African guitar and harp (kora), Colombian guitar, cello, ancient woodwinds and a wide variety of percussion instruments.\\"O\\" - The Show - Video & Music cirquedusoleil.com. Retrieved 11-4-2009. During the show, the score is performed by a live band situated behind glass walls above and to the side of the stage.

It also applies to sound recordings like electromagnetic fields or vibrations using different microphones like a passive magnetic antenna for electromagnetic recordings or contact microphones. For underwater field recordings, a field recordist uses hydrophones to capture the sounds and/or movements of whales, or other aquatic organisms. These recordings are very useful for sound designers. Field recording of natural sounds, also called phonography (a term chosen to illustrate its similarities to photography), was originally developed as a documentary adjunct to research work in the field, and foley work for film. With the introduction of high-quality, portable recording equipment, it has subsequently become an evocative artform in itself. In the 1970s, both processed and natural phonographic recordings, (pioneered by Irv Teibel's Environments series), became popular. \\"Field recordings\\" may also refer to simple monaural or stereo recordings taken of musicians in familiar and casual surroundings, such as the ethnomusicology recordings pioneered by John Lomax, Nonesuch Records, and Vanguard Records. Techniques Two field recordist's recording ecoacoustics at Seltún Geothermal Area for a sound design project. Field recording often involves the capture of ambient noises that are low level and complex, and, in response, the requirements from the field recordist have often pushed the technical limits of recording equipment, that is, demanding low noise and extended frequency response in a portable, battery- powered unit. For this reason, field recordists have favoured high-quality (usually professional) recorders, microphones, and microphone pre-amplifiers. The history of the equipment used in this area closely tracks the development of professional portable audio recording technology. Field recording is typically recorded in the same channel format as the desired result, for instance, stereo recording equipment will yield a stereo product. In contrast, a multitrack remote recording captures many microphones on multiple channels, later to be creatively modified, augmented, and mixed down to a specific consumer format. Field recording experienced a rapid increase in popularity during the early 1960s, with the introduction of high-quality, portable recording equipment, (e.g., the Uher, and Nagra portable reel-to-reel decks). The arrival of the DAT (Digital Audio Tape) in the 1980s introduced a new level of audio recording fidelity with extended frequency response and low self-noise. In addition to these technologies, other popular means for field recording have included the analog cassette (CAC), the DCC (Digital Compact Cassette), and the MiniDisc. The latest generation of recorders are completely digital-based (hard disk/Flash). It is also possible to use personal electronic devices, (e.g., a smartphone or tablet), with software, to do field recording and editing. Newly developed techniques include the creative placement of microphones, (including contact microphones and hydrophones, for example), the diffusion of captured sounds, and individual approaches. ResearchEthnomusicology= Field recording was originally a way to document oral presentations, and ethnomusicology projects (pioneered by Charles Seeger, John Lomax and Béla Bartók). =Bioacoustics= Field recording is an important tool in bioacoustics and biomusicology, most commonly in research on bird song. Animals in the wild can display very different vocalizations from those in captivity. ArtMusic= The use of field recordings in avant-garde, musique concrète, experimental, and, more recently, ambient music was evident almost from the birth of recording technology. Most noteworthy for pioneering the conceptual and theoretical framework with art music that most openly embraced the use of raw sound material and field recordings was Pierre Schaeffer, who was developing musique concrète as early as 1940. Further impetus was provided by the World Soundscape Project, initiated by Canadian composer R. Murray Schafer in the 1970s; this work involved studying the acoustic ecology of a particular location by the use of field recordings. Field recordings are now a common source material for a range of musical results, from contemporary musique concrète compositions to film soundtracks, video game soundtracks, and effects. Chris Watson, formerly of Cabaret Voltaire, is now perhaps the world's leading exponent of this art, with his recordings used for David Attenborough's series for the BBC, programmes for BBC Radio, and many other outlets. Another notable application of field recordings as of contemporary music is its inclusion in some vaporwave tracks, commonly recordings of public areas such as malls or grocery stores to add atmosphere. The sounds recorded by any device, and then transferred to digital format, are used by some musicians through their performance with MIDI-interfaced instruments. A contemporary artist with great success for his compositions is Christian Fennesz. In addition, electronic musicians, such as DJ Throwing Shade, have been using field recordings to create music that has \\"someone actually playing an instrument in real life, something which cannot be re-created in the same way through synthesised sounds\\". Earlier innovators who are noted for the importance and boldness of their projects are Luigi Russolo, who, in 1913, with his manifesto, L'arte dei rumori (The Art of Noises), gave musical value to environmental noise. He also designed and built the Intonarumori—the first instruments for making noise. Francesco Balilla Pratella utilized the Intonarumori in his opera, L'aviatore Dro, which was written in close collaboration with Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, (the founder of the Futurist movement). =Radio documentary= Radio documentaries often use recordings from the field, e.g., a locomotive engine running, for evocative effect. This type of sound functions as the non-fictional counterpart to the sound effect. =Politics= During the early years of commercial recordings, the speeches of politicians sold well, since few people had radios. The HMV (\\"His Master's Voice\\") catalogue for 1914–1918http://www.worldcat.org/title/gramophone- records-of-the-first-world-war-an-hmv-catalogue-1914-1918/oclc/1938531 lists over a dozen such records. Probably the last time such records sold well was in 1965, when the LP, The Voice of Churchill, reached number 7 in the UK album charts. This was immediately after Churchill's death.

Guatapé official website (www.guatape-antioquia.gov.co); retrieved 2010-03-24. It is a part of the subregion of Eastern Antioquia and is located away from Medellín. Guatapé is bordered on the north by Alejandría, San Rafael to the east, and Granada and El Peñol to the south. This town is the gathering place for \\"Las Vegas\\", or the small farms of the area. The town is a major tourist attraction, especially for travelers from Medellín, for both El Peñón de Guatapé, a large rock that visitors can climb, and the famous zócalos (baseboards) that adorn several of the buildings. History Before Iberian conquistadors reached the area in the 16th century, this territory was inhabited by indigenous ethnic groups, some controlled by a cacique named Guatape. In his honor, the town was named after him. The name \\"Guatapé\\", comes from the Quechua language, related to \\"stones and water\\". Another name that the town had had in the past is \\"La Ceja de Guatapé\\". In 1714, the indigenous people under Guatapé of this region were grouped into a shelter known as \\"San Antonio de Remolinos Peñol\\". Traces of their existence come from clay urns found in the town of Alto Verde, and several archaeological sites not yet studied in the villages of La Peña, La Piedra, El Roble and El Rosario. Guatapé was founded 4 October 1811, by the Spaniard Don Francisco Giraldo y Jimenez. It was declared a municipality in September 1867. Guatapé has undergone changes throughout its history. It was predominately a farming town that relied on livestock, agriculture and mining. Empresas Públicas de Medellín built a large hydroelectric complex here in the 1970s. This megaproject produced large impacts on social, economic, political, environmental and cultural development in the locality. With the construction of this dam, Guatapé became one of the most important electric production centers in the country. Demographics Total Population: 6,469 inhabitants (2015) * Urban population: 5,045 * Rural population: 1,424 Literacy: 92.3% (2005) =Ethnography= According to figures presented by DANE census in 2005, the ethnic makeup of the township is the following: * Mestizo & White (99.96%) * Afro-Colombian (0.04 %) Sites of interest Typical colorful facade of the buildings in the town. * Calle del Recuerdo (\\"Memory Lane\\") * Parish Church of Nuestra Señora del Carmen * Chapel of Our Lady of Santa Ana * Community Historical Museum. * Pueblo de Zócalos * Waterfalls =La Piedra= Peñón de Guatapé El Peñón de Guatapé is a rock formation that borders a lake. It formed along the Antioquia Rock Base (batolito de antioquia), 70 million years ago. With two-thirds of its height below ground, the exposed vertical face is over 200 meters high and visible from throughout the surrounding countryside. Visitors can scale the rock via a staircase built into one side, a path that includes more than 649 steps to the top.Guatape's Official Major Office On the flat top of the rock, food vendors offer outdoor tables overlooking vistas that stretch to the horizon in every direction. Above the food vendors are two gift shops, and an open-air viewing area to see the spectacular scenery. Also you can visit two monasteries, that belong to the \\"Benedictinos\\" Communities. The monks are devoted to receive and share with visitors. There are many Ferries available, to take tours around the dam, and to visit islands known as \\"The Fantasy Island Hotel\\", located at 3 NM, north of Guatapé shore.

It is bounded by the Andes, Jericó, and Támesis municipalities to the north and the Caldas department to the south. The municipality is located between the San Juan river, which is called Docató (meaning \\"River stones\\") by the natives, and a branch of the Western Cordillera. Jardín is identified by its preserved colonial architecture, lush vegetation, and abundant rivers and streams. Among others, rivers that flow through Jardin include the San Juan, Claro, and Dojurgo. Trout that is caught in the local rivers is a popular dish in the area. The municipal anthem of the town is \\"Hymn to Jardín\\". Mean daily temperatures are 19°C with moderate humidity. Toponymy Regarding the name \\"Garden\\" () that belongs to this town, legend says that when the founders came to the Alto de las Flores (\\"Flower hilltop\\"), from the sietecueros village, they saw the valley that is today Jardín. At the time, it was entirely a jungle, full of white snakewood and crossed by two riachuelos. On seeing the beauty of the area, the settlers began to call it a garden. History The earliest evidence of human settlement in the area comes from graves that probably belonged to people of the Chamíes ethnicity and Catio language. These people were also known as \\"Docatoes\\", after the nearby Docató river. Colonization of Antioquia was at its peak in the 1860s. During this time, a settler named Indalecio Peláez claimed huge tracts of land between two riachuelos known as Volcanes and El Salado in 1863. In 1864, Dr. José María Gómez Angel, a well- known priest, and two other priests came to Jardín after fleeing from General Mosquera, who at the time was in Medellín. These priests came up with the idea to create a more independent village in the area, and they discussed this idea with the aforementioned farmers and early settlers. In 1871 Jardín was declared a parish. In 1882 it was declared a town by Luciano Restrepo, who at the time was the president of the then Antioquia State. Architecture Unlike some other municipalities of Antioquia, Jardín has remained largely unchanged for the last 140 years. The colonial architecture predominant throughout the area is characterized by whitewashed buildings with brightly painted doors, balconies, and cowhide chairs. Several of the chairs are hand- painted with scenes and landscapes from the local culture. Demographics An example of the colorful balconies typical of Jardín. According to figures presented by the DANE 2005 census, the ethnographic makeup of the township is as follows: * Mestizo and White: 89.3% * Indigenous: 10% * Afro-Colombian: 0.7% Economy * Agriculture: coffee, plantain, sugarcane, and beans * Tourism * Trout fishing * Artisan crafts, traditionally made by nuns In the past, most inhabitants dedicated their lives to growing coffee, plantains, beans and sugarcane. Today, tourism is in this city is a basic source of income. The town is unique in having over 40 hotels, when larger municipalities of Antioquia usually do not have more than ten. Places of interestMain plaza= Basilica of the Immaculate Conception Like many traditional towns, the plaza is the main center of activity in Jardín. Principle Park, also known as El Libertador plaza, was declared a National Monument of Colombia in 1985. It is frequently visited for its nearby shops and inns. The floor is paved with rocks from the Tapartó river. The site features color wooden chairs and several gardens. The town's main church is the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, declared a National Monument of Colombia in 1980. This basilica was built from hand-cut stones from the Tapartó river nearby in a Neo-Gothic style. It was declared a minor basilica in 2003. =Cable-car ride= Completed in 2007, Jardín has two cable-car lines. The lines were created to help peasants from the villages of La Selva, La Linda and La Salada enter the town to sell their goods and then return, and also to boost tourism. One cable-car ride to a local mountain peak known as the Flower Hilltop () or Cristo Rey, in reference to the statue on site, provides a great view of the town. It has a balcony for looking at the town and a cafe. As of Fall 2018, this cable car is not currently in operation, however you can also arrive by hiking. The second cable-car ride goes to a viewpoint by the name of La Garrucha on the opposite side of town from Alto de las Flores. There is a cafe and balcony with another great view of the town. This viewpoint can also be reached by vehicle or as part of a 4 mile hiking loop. =Other attractions= Paintball in the Jardín countryside has also become a popular pastime in recent years. Jardín is surrounded by several nature reserves that are popular tourist destinations. One example is where La Herrera ravine and La Bonita ravine join together, forming what is known as the \\"Heart Puddle\\" (). Other places of interest include the following: * Touring the colorful balconies of the houses and buildings in the municipality, many of which feature flowers. * Cave of Splendor, which can be reached by walking 10 kilometers from the town. * Clara Rojas Museum has 19th century furniture and relics from the colonization period of Antioquia. * Yellow-eared Parrot Nature Reserve * Moto-Ratón Tour - These so-called \\"motorcycle mouses\\" are motorcycles that pull a small cart with people.

The 61-minute live-action film stars many types of birds, including budgies (commonly known in the US as parakeets) and lovebirds. The film also features other trained animals, including cats, dogs and a crow. Except for three humans (producer Ken Murray, bird trainer George Burton, and Elizabeth Walters) in a short set-up segment before the opening credits, the film features an all-animal cast. The film was shot on the world's second smallest film set, a miniature village built onto a tabletop. The film received an Honorary Academy Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences \\"In which artistry and patience blended in a novel and entertaining use of the medium of motion pictures.\\" It was also one of the first films to be released to cinemas on slow-burning cellulose acetate safety film instead of the dangerously inflammable nitrate stock used up until then. Initially, projectionists reported film damage due to the acetate base being less 'slippery' than that of nitrate (celluloid) based film. Before long it was found that a thin coating of wax applied along the film edges solved this problem. Plot The plot of the film is that the birds live in a fictional, peaceful town named Chirpendale. A crow arrives known as the Black Menace. As his name suggests, the Black Menace terrorizes the town. The story follows the adventures of the hero Bill, a cab driver, as he tries to save Coo and the rest of the town's inhabitants from certain destruction.

The company is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. History Motorola Solutions began trading as a separate independent company on January 4, 2011, under the NYSE symbol MSI. It is the legal successor of the old Motorola, Inc. (founded in 1928); the transaction was structured so the old Motorola changed its name to Motorola Solutions and spun off Motorola Mobility as a separate company. Motorola Solutions retained the old Motorola's pre-2011 stock price history, though the old Motorola's ticker symbol MOT was retired. The company produces and sells communications products and services to public safety and government agencies (law enforcement, fire, emergency medical services, and national government security) as well as private entities including utilities, mining, energy, manufacturing, hospitality, retail, transportation and logistics. After the split, Motorola Solutions comprised the previous Government and Public Safety division of Motorola Inc, the enterprise mobility management division, and the cellular infrastructure group. Chinese telecoms company Huawei and Motorola Solutions have settled their intellectual property disputes in July 2010. Motorola Solutions sold the cellular infrastructure business to Nokia Siemens Networks. The acquisition, which was originally announced in July 2010, was completed on April 29, 2011, for $975 million in cash. As part of the transaction approximately 6,900 employees transferred to Nokia Siemens Networks. In the former Motorola parent company, it was the second largest division based on revenue.  Post Split  On October 27, 2014, Motorola Solutions sold its Enterprise business to Zebra Technologies for $3.45 billion in cash. As part of the sale, approximately 4,500 Motorola Solutions employees from locations throughout the world were transferred to Zebra. A large majority of this business was formerly Symbol Technologies, which Motorola, Inc. acquired in 2007. In August, 2015, the company received a $1 billion investment from the private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, enabling a stock buyback and providing Silver Lake with two board seats. In December, 2015, the company announced that it would acquire Airwave Solutions, the UK based operator of the British public safety radio network servicing the police, fire and ambulance services across England, Scotland and Wales. The company completed the acquisition on February 19, 2016. Beginning in March 2017, Motorola Solutions filed a series of lawsuits against China-based two- way radio manufacturer Hytera in the United States, Germany and Australia, as well as with the United States International Trade Commission (USITC). The complaints allege that Hytera is intentionally infringing on patents owned by Motorola Solutions and utilizing trade secrets stolen by three former Motorola Solutions employees who left to join Hytera. Motorola Solutions is seeking to stop Hytera from selling and importing its devices in these countries. In April 2017, the USITC announced that it had decided to institute an investigation into Hytera’s trade practices. In August 2017, Motorola Solutions announced it completed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, a privately-held provider of broadband push-to-talk (PTT) for commercial customers. In December 2017, two-way radio manufacturer Hytera filed antitrust litigation against Motorola Solutions in alleging that Motorola is engaging in anti-competitive practices that are unlawful under the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Hytera's complaint alleges that Motorola Solutions prevents Hytera from competing in the U.S. marketplace by enforcing inflated prices and engaging in a monopolistic scheme that includes forcing LMR dealers to drop Hytera's products. In March 2018, Motorola Solutions acquired Avigilon for about $1 billion. In January 2019, the company acquired Livermore, California-based VaaS International Holdings, and its subsidiary, license plate reading technology company Vigilant Solutions, for $445 million. In July 2019, the company acquired WatchGuard Inc. In July 2020, the company acquired IndigoVision. In August 2020, the company acquired Pelco Inc.

The original version of the tale tells of a badly-behaved old woman who enters the forest home of three bachelor bears whilst they are away. She sits in their chairs, eats some of their porridge, and sleeps in one of their beds. When the bears return and discover her, she wakes up, jumps out of the window, and is never seen again. The second version replaced the old woman with a little girl named Goldilocks, and the third and by far best-known version replaced the original bear trio with Papa Bear, Mama Bear and Baby Bear (who is not actually an infant, but rather a small cub). What was originally a frightening oral tale became a cozy family story with only a hint of menace. The story has elicited various interpretations and has been adapted to film, opera, and other media. \\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\\" is one of the most popular fairy tales in the English language.Elms 1977, p. 257 Plot In Robert Southey's version of the tale, three anthropomorphic bears - \\"a little, small, wee bear, a middle-sized bear, and a great, huge bear\\" - live together in a house in the woods. Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable. Each of these \\"bachelor\\" bears has his own porridge bowl, chair, and bed. One day they make porridge for breakfast, but it is too hot to eat, so they decide to take a walk in the woods while their porridge cools. An old woman approaches the bears' house. As she has been sent out by her family, she is a disgrace to them. She is impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction. She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch. Assured that no one is home, she walks in. The old woman eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles into his chair and breaks it. Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed. The end of the tale is reached when the bears return. Wee Bear finds his empty bowl, his broken chair, and the old woman sleeping in his bed and cries, \\"Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!\\" The old woman wakes, jumps out the window and is never seen again. Origins Robert Southey The story was first recorded in narrative form by British writer and poet Robert Southey, and first published anonymously as \\"The Story of the Three Bears\\" in 1837 in a volume of his writings called The Doctor.Tatar 2002, p. 245 The same year Southey's tale was published, the story was versified by George Nicol, who acknowledged the anonymous author of The Doctor as \\"the great, original concocter\\" of the tale.Ober 1981, p. 47 Southey was delighted with Nicol's effort to bring more exposure to the tale, concerned children might overlook it in The Doctor.Curry 1921, p. 65 Nicol's version was illustrated with engravings by B. Hart (after \\"C.J.\\"), and was reissued in 1848 with Southey identified as the story's author.Ober 1981, p. 48 The story of the three bears was in circulation before the publication of Southey's tale.Dorson 2001, p. 94 In 1813, for example, Southey was telling the story to friends, and in 1831 Eleanor Mure fashioned a handmade booklet about the three bears and the old woman for her nephew Horace Broke's birthday. Southey and Mure differ in details. Southey's bears have porridge, but Mure's have milk;Opie 1992, p. 199 Southey's old woman has no motive for entering the house, but Mure's old woman is piqued when her courtesy visit is rebuffed;Ober 1981, pp. 2,10 Southey's old woman runs away when discovered, but Mure's old woman is impaled on the steeple of St Paul's Cathedral.Opie 1992, pp. 199-200 Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie point out in The Classic Fairy Tales (1999) that the tale has a \\"partial analogue\\" in \\"Snow White\\": the lost princess enters the dwarfs' house, tastes their food, and falls asleep in one of their beds. In a manner similar to the three bears, the dwarfs cry, \\"Someone's been sitting in my chair!\\", \\"Someone's been eating off my plate!\\", and \\"Someone's been sleeping in my bed!\\" The Opies also point to similarities in a Norwegian tale about a princess who takes refuge in a cave inhabited by three Russian princes dressed in bearskins. She eats their food and hides under a bed.Opie 1992, p. 200 In 1865, Charles Dickens referenced a similar tale in Our Mutual Friend, but in that story the house belongs to hobgoblins rather than bears. Dickens' reference however suggests a yet-to-be-discovered analogue or source.Ober 1981, p. xii Hunting rituals and ceremonies have been suggested and dismissed as possible origins.Ober 1981, p. xElms 1977, p. 259 In 1894, \\"Scrapefoot\\", a tale with a fox as antagonist that bears striking similarities to Southey's story, was uncovered by the folklorist Joseph Jacobs and may predate Southey's version in the oral tradition. Some sources state that it was illustrator John D. Batten who in 1894 reported a variant of the tale at least 40 years old. In this version, the three bears live in a castle in the woods and are visited by a fox called Scrapefoot who drinks their milk, sits in their chairs, and rests in their beds. This version belongs to the early Fox and Bear tale-cycle. Southey possibly heard \\"Scrapefoot\\", and confused its \\"vixen\\" with a synonym for an unpleasant malicious old woman. Some maintain however that the story as well as the old woman originated with Southey. Southey most likely learned the tale as a child from his uncle William Tyler. Uncle Tyler may have told a version with a vixen (female fox) as the intruder, and then Southey may have later confused \\"vixen\\" with another common meaning of \\"a crafty old woman\\". P. M. Zall writes in \\"The Gothic Voice of Father Bear\\" (1974) that \\"it was no trick for Southey, a consummate technician, to recreate the improvisational tone of an Uncle William through rhythmical reiteration, artful alliteration ('they walked into the woods, while'), even bardic interpolation ('She could not have been a good, honest Old Woman')\\".Quoted in: Ober 1981, p. ix Ultimately, it is uncertain where Southey or his uncle learned the tale. \\"Scrapefoot\\" illustration by John D. Batten Later variations: Goldilocks Twelve years after the publication of Southey's tale, Joseph Cundall transformed the antagonist from an ugly old woman to a pretty little girl in his Treasury of Pleasure Books for Young Children. He explained his reasons for doing so in a dedicatory letter to his children, dated November 1849, which was inserted at the beginning of the book: Once the little girl entered the tale, she remained – suggesting children prefer an attractive child in the story rather than an ugly old woman. The juvenile antagonist saw a succession of names:Seal 2001, p. 91 Silver Hair in the pantomime Harlequin and The Three Bears; or, Little Silver Hair and the Fairies by J. B. Buckstone (1853); Silver-Locks in Aunt Mavor's Nursery Tales (1858); Silverhair in George MacDonald's \\"The Golden Key\\" (1867); Golden Hair in Aunt Friendly's Nursery Book (ca. 1868); Silver-Hair and Goldenlocks at various times; Little Golden- Hair (1889);Briggs 2002, pp. 128–129 and finally Goldilocks in Old Nursery Stories and Rhymes (1904). Tatar credits Flora Annie Steel with naming the child (1918). Goldilocks caught in Baby Bear's bed – by Leonard Leslie Brooke Goldilocks's fate varies in the many retellings: in some versions, she runs into the forest, in some she is almost eaten by the bears but her mother rescues her, in some she vows to be a good child, and in some she returns home. Whatever her fate, Goldilocks fares better than Southey's vagrant old woman who, in his opinion, deserved a stint in the House of Correction, and far better than Miss Mure's old woman who is impaled upon a steeple in St Paul's church-yard.Tatar 2002, p. 246 Southey's all-male ursine trio has not been left untouched over the years. The group was re-cast as Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear, but the date of this change is disputed. Tatar indicates it occurred by 1852, while Katherine Briggs suggests the event occurred in 1878 with Mother Goose's Fairy Tales published by Routledge. With the publication of the tale by \\"Aunt Fanny\\" in 1852, the bears became a family in the illustrations to the tale but remained three bachelor bears in the text. In Dulcken's version of 1858, the two larger bears are brother and sister, and friends to the little bear. This arrangement represents the evolution of the ursine trio from the traditional three male bears to a family of father, mother, and child.Ober 1981, p. 142 In a publication ca. 1860, the bears have become a family at last in both text and illustrations: \\"the old papa bear, the mama bear, and the little boy bear\\".Ober 1981, p. 178 In a Routledge publication c 1867, Papa Bear is called Rough Bruin, Mama Bear is Mammy Muff, and Baby Bear is called Tiny. Inexplicably, the illustrations depict the three as male bears.Ober 1981, p. 190 In publications subsequent to Aunt Fanny's of 1852, Victorian nicety required editors to routinely and silently alter Southey's \\"[T]here she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down came her's, plump upon the ground\\" to read \\"and down she came\\", omitting any reference to the human bottom. The cumulative effect of the several changes to the tale since its original publication was to transform a fearsome oral tale into a cozy family story with an unrealised hint of menace. Interpretations Maria Tatar, in The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales (2002), notes that Southey's tale is sometimes viewed as a cautionary tale that imparts a lesson about the hazards of wandering off and exploring unknown territory. Like \\"The Tale of the Three Little Pigs\\", the story uses repetitive formulas to engage the child's attention and to reinforce the point about safety and shelter. Tatar points out that the tale is typically framed today as a discovery of what is \\"just right\\", but for earlier generations, it was a tale about an intruder who could not control herself when encountering the possessions of others.Tatar 2002, p. 251 Illustration by John Batten, 1890 In The Uses of Enchantment (1976), the child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim describes Goldilocks as \\"poor, beautiful, and charming\\", and notes that the story does not describe her positively except for her hair.Elms 1977, p. 264 Bettelheim mainly discussed the tale in terms of Goldilocks' struggle to move past Oedipal issues to confront adolescent identity problems. In Bettelheim's view, the tale fails to encourage children \\"to pursue the hard labor of solving, one at a time, the problems which growing up presents\\", and does not end as fairy tales should with the \\"promise of future happiness awaiting those who have mastered their Oedipal situation as a child\\". He believes the tale is an escapist one that thwarts the child reading it from gaining emotional maturity. Tatar criticises Bettelheim's views: \\"[His] reading is perhaps too invested in instrumentalizing fairy tales, that is, in turning them into vehicles that convey messages and set forth behavioral models for the child. While the story may not solve oedipal issues or sibling rivalry as Bettelheim believes \\"Cinderella\\" does, it suggests the importance of respecting property and the consequences of just 'trying out' things that do not belong to you.\\" Elms suggests Bettelheim may have missed the anal aspect of the tale that would make it helpful to the child's personality development. In Handbook of Psychobiography Elms describes Southey's tale not as one of Bettelheimian post-Oedipal ego development but as one of Freudian pre-Oedipal anality. He believes the story appeals chiefly to preschoolers who are engaged in \\"cleanliness training, maintaining environmental and behavioral order, and distress about disruption of order\\". His own experience and his observation of others lead him to believe children align themselves with the tidy, organised ursine protagonists rather than the unruly, delinquent human antagonist. In Elms's view, the anality of \\"The Story of the Three Bears\\" can be traced directly to Robert Southey's fastidious, dirt-obsessed aunt who raised him and passed her obsession to him in a milder form.Schultz 2005, p. 93 Literary elements The story makes extensive use of the literary rule of three, featuring three chairs, three bowls of porridge, three beds, and the three title characters who live in the house. There are also three sequences of the bears discovering in turn that someone has been eating from their porridge, sitting in their chairs, and finally, lying in their beds, at which point is the climax of Goldilocks being discovered. This follows three earlier sequences of Goldilocks trying the bowls of porridge, chairs, and beds successively, each time finding the third \\"just right\\". Author Christopher Booker characterises this as the \\"dialectical three\\", where \\"the first is wrong in one way, the second in another or opposite way, and only the third, in the middle, is just right\\". Booker continues: \\"This idea that the way forward lies in finding an exact middle path between opposites is of extraordinary importance in storytelling\\".Booker 2005, pp. 229–32 This concept has spread across many other disciplines, particularly developmental psychology, biology, economics and engineering where it is called the \\"Goldilocks principle\\". In planetary astronomy, a planet orbiting its sun at just the right distance for liquid water to exist on its surface, neither too hot nor too cold, is referred to as being in the 'Goldilocks Zone'.  Adaptations  * The MGM cartoons of the late 1930s included a Bear Family subseries by Hugh Harman based on the story, starting with Goldilocks and the Three Bears (1939), then continuing on to A Rainy Day with the Bear Family (1940) and Papa Gets the Bird (1941). The MGM character of Barney Bear, originating concurrently, was at times advertised as being this Bear Family's Papa, though creator Rudolf Ising appears to have always intended him as a separate character. * A shortfilm by Terrytoons titled The Three Bears was released in 1939. This short depicts the bears as having Italian accents and mannerisms. The short had gained internet meme status in more recent years for the sequence in which the family return home to discover that somebody had been eating their spaghetti, papa bear exclaiming \\"somebody touched my spaghett!\\" * The Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons include a prominent Three Bears family, distinguished by a short, irascible father, a deadpan mother, and a huge, oafish seven-year-old \\"baby,\\" still in diapers. * Songwriter Bobby Troup's hipster interpretation titled \\"The Three Bears\\", first recorded by Page Cavanaugh in 1946, is often erroneously credited to \\"anonymous\\" and re-titled \\"Three Bears Rap\\", \\"Three Bears with a Beat\\", etc. * The three bears may or may not have been the inspiration for Stan and Jan Berenstain's Berenstain Bears. * The 1993 PC game Sesame Street: Numbers features a Sesame Street-esque twist on the story, and it is found in one of the three books in the game. Titled Count Goldilocks and the 3 Bears, it features the Count von Count taking the role of Goldilocks, as \\"Count Goldilocks\\". Instead of arriving after Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear go on their picnic, he arrives before they go out. He then proceeds to count them, their picnic baskets, wooden chairs, and beds. Each time he is done counting one of them, he asks why they have three of what he counted. At the end, Baby Bear says that they have three of everything because they are three bears. Then, they finally go on their picnic in the woods. * Kurt Schwertsik's 35-minute opera Roald Dahl's Goldilocks premiered in 1997 at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. The opera's setting is the Forest Assizes where Baby Bear stands accused of assaulting Miss Goldie Locks. The tables are turned when the defence limns the trauma suffered by the bears at the hands of that \\"brazen little crook\\", Goldilocks.Roald Dahl's Goldilocks * In Rooster Teeth Productions RWBY, Yang Xiao Long is a carefree, reckless yellow-haired girl. She is a \\"rule-breaker\\" who likes teddy bears. She is an allusion to Goldilocks which is reflected in her name, translated from Chinese as \\"sun\\", referring to the colour yellow. Also, in her trailer, Yang confronts Hei \\"Junior\\" Xiong, whose name is Chinese for \\"black bear.\\" Combining this with his nickname, he alludes to the Baby Bear. * The TV show Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child featured an adaption of \\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\\" in a Jamaican setting which featured the voices of Raven-Symoné as Goldilocks, Tone Loc as Desmond Bear, Alfre Woodard as Winsone Bear, and David Alan Grier as Dudley Bear. * In an episode of Sesame Street, a reversed version of the story titled \\"Baby Bear and the Three Goldilocks\\" was told (and written) by Telly and Elmo. * A fractured version of the story was made for Jay Ward's Fractured Fairy Tales, in which Goldilocks had a winter resort and the three bears invade for hibernation purposes; Papa Bear was short and short-tempered, Mama Bear was more even-tempered, and Baby Bear was a huge, oversized dope who was \\"not sleepy\\". * The television show Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater Kittylocks and the Three Bears is an adaptation of the story. * \\"Goldilocks Eats Grits\\" has the bears living in a cave in Georgia in the United States. * A commercial for the 2005 Hummer portrayed the Three Bears returning from a family trip to their very upscale home to discover all the elements of the traditional story. They race to their garage to check on the status of the family Hummers. Mama Bear and Papa Bear are relieved that both vehicles are still in place, but Baby Bear is distraught to find his missing as the camera cuts away to Goldilocks (in this version portrayed by a very attractive young woman) rakishly smiling as she makes her getaway in Baby Bear's Hummer down a scenic mountain road. *In 2014, MC Frontalot released a hip-hop rendition of the story as part of the album, Question Bedtime, in which the narrator warns the three bears of a ruthless woman called Gold Locks who hunts and eats bear cubs. An official music video was uploaded in 2015. * In 2016, professional wrestler Bray Wyatt read a dark version to Edge and Christian. * Disney Junior's Goldie & Bear premiered in 2016. The tale is set after the events of the story where Goldilocks (voiced by Natalie Lander) and Jack Bear (voiced by Georgie Kidder) eventually became best friends.

The community is divided in half by the Welland Canal, as there is no bridge in the immediate vicinity to connect the two halves of the community. In the summer, a small free ferry for pedestrians and cyclists runs across the canal. In the winter, residents must use the bridge on Highway 20, which results in a 13.3 km (8.3 mi) trip to get to the other side. Like all the ports on the first Welland Canal, Port Robinson was named after a member of the Family Compact that once ruled Upper Canada, as Ontario was then named. Sir John Beverly Robinson was Attorney General of Upper Canada at the time the first Canal was built, and the port was originally named Port Beverly. The post office dates from 1835 onward. The demise of Bridge 12 Bridge St in Port Robinson was originally linked by a vertical lift bridge, numbered as Bridge 12 by the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority. On August 25, 1974, the 600-foot ore carrier Steelton, travelling northbound on the canal, struck and destroyed the bridge. left The east tower of the bridge toppled over, while the west tower collapsed in on itself. The bridge span was pushed into the water, severely deformed. The damage to the bridge was estimated as between $15 and $20 million. It was scrapped in its entirety. The removal of the towers from the canal, especially the counterweights (some 300 tons each), necessitated the use of a special heavy-duty floating crane. The canal was closed until September 9 for the repairs. The Steelton suffered damage to its bow and pilot house, estimated at about $1 million. The repairs were made at Port Colborne, at the southern terminus of the Welland Canal. There was no loss of life. The bridge master, Albert Beaver, and a watchman on the ship suffered minor injuries. The ensuing investigation concluded that the ship failed to blow the whistle to signal its approach and the bridge could not be raised in time. After the accident, rebuilding the bridge or building a tunnel to replace it was considered. In the end, it was concluded that the volume of local vehicular traffic was not sufficient to warrant such an expense. Instead, a passenger ferry service was launched in early 1977. The ferry can transport people and bicycles, but is not big enough for cars, thus forcing residents who want to use a car to take the long route. In 2015, amid debate about discontinuing the ferry, it was estimated that the ferry carries 2000 pedestrians and 6000 touring cyclists per year. A similar accident occurred at Bridge 11 in Allanburg in 2001. That bridge was lowered onto the passing bulk carrier Windoc, which afterwards caught fire. The ship was a total loss, but no injuries were reported, and Bridge 11 suffered minor damage and was repaired.\\"Marine Investigation Report #M01C0054: Striking and Subsequent Fire on Board Bridge 11, Welland Canal and Bulk Carrier Windoc, Welland Canal, Allanburg, Ontario, 11 August 2001.\\" Transportation Safety Board of Canada, 2005-07-05. Retrieved on 2007-08-15. While repairs were underway, Port Robinson residents wishing to travel by car to other side of the community had to drive even farther than usual to use the Main Street Tunnel in Welland.

It is better known by the title Rage Over a Lost Penny, Vented in a Caprice' (from ). This title appears on the autograph manuscript, but not in Beethoven's hand, and has been attributed to his friend Anton Schindler. It is a favourite with audiences and is frequently performed as a showpiece. Music Despite the late opus number, the work's composition has been dated between 1795 and 1798. Beethoven left the piece unpublished and incomplete; it was published in 1828 by Anton Diabelli, who obscured the fact that it had been left unfinished. The performance time runs between five and six minutes; the tempo of the piece is Allegro vivace (). The indication alla ingharese is of interest, as no such word as \\"ingharese\\" exists in standard Italian. To people of Beethoven's day, \\"Gypsy music\\" and \\"Hungarian music\\" were synonymous terms. Beethoven seems to have conflated alla zingarese (in the Gypsy style) and all'ongarese (in the Hungarian style) to come up with a unique term alla ingharese. Robert Schumann wrote of the work that \\"it would be difficult to find anything merrier than this whim... It is the most amiable, harmless anger, similar to that felt when one cannot pull a shoe from off the foot,\\" citing the work as an instance of Beethoven's earthliness against those fixated upon a transcendental image of the composer.

She was the third wife of Emperor Xuan.  Early life  Empress Wang's father Wang Fengguang (王奉光) was a hereditary acting marquess (關內侯) when he met Emperor Xuan while he was still a commoner, based on their common interest in cockfighting. According to legend, she was betrothed to several men in succession, but each time her fiancé died before marriage could occur. After Emperor Xuan became emperor, he took her as a concubine (as Consort Wang), but she was not one of his favourites. Emperor Xuan's first wife, Empress Xu Pingjun was poisoned in 71 BC by the ambitious Xian (顯), the wife of the regent Huo Guang, who wanted to make her daughter Huo Chengjun empress; an objective that she was successful in after Empress Xu's death. While Huo Chengjun was empress, she allegedly tried unsuccessfully several times to poison Empress Xu's son Crown Prince Liu Shi, to make her potential future son the imperial heir. Empress After the Huo clan was destroyed and Empress Huo deposed in 66 BC, Emperor Xuan considered who amongst his consorts to create as his empress. At that time, he favoured Consorts Hua, Zhang, and Wei, each of whom had bore him children. He almost settled on Consort Zhang as his new empress. However, he became hesitant, remembering how Empress Huo had tried to murder the crown prince. He therefore resolved to create as his empress someone who was childless and kind. He decided on Consort Wang, and created her empress in 64 BC. He also created her father, Wang Fengguang, the Marquess of Qiongcheng (邛成侯). Emperor Xuan put Prince Shi in her care, and she cared for him well. Despite her position, she was never one of Emperor Xuan's favourites and she rarely saw him. Empress Wang would have a role in Crown Prince Shi's eventual choice of a wife. In the mid-50s BC, Consort Sima, the favourite consort of Prince Shi died from an illness. Prince Shi was grief- stricken and became ill and depressed. Emperor Xuan was concerned, so he had Empress Wang select the most beautiful of the young ladies in waiting and had them sent to Prince Shi. Wang Zhengjun was one of the ladies in waiting chosen. She, as the mother of his first-born son Liu Ao (later Emperor Cheng), would eventually become his wife and empress. Empress Wang was not known to have had significant political influence as an empress.  Empress dowager and grand empress dowager  Tomb of Empress Wang in Xi'an, Shaanxi After her husband Emperor Xuan died in 49 BC and her stepson Prince Shi took the throne as Emperor Yuan, she held the title of empress dowager. She would outlive him as well. After Emperor Yuan died in 33 BC, his son, Crown Prince Ao, took the throne as Emperor Cheng. Empress Wang then held the title of grand empress dowager, and she became also semi-formally known as Empress Dowager Qiongcheng (based on her father's title) to be distinguished with her daughter-in-law. She did not appear to have much political influence during the reigns of either Emperor Yuan or Cheng, even though they appeared to genuinely love and respect her as a mother/grandmother. She died in 16 BC and was buried with her husband, Emperor Xuan.  References  * Book of Han, vol. 97, part 1. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 25, 27, 29, 31.

According to the Saint Petersburg Times, new recruits (storonniki, literally \\"supporters\\" or \\"siders\\") to the organization have traditionally been required to serve as low-level functionaries in the organization, acting as drivers and handing out flyers as well as attending instructional sessions on the group's philosophy and beliefs, many of which are derived from a book written by Barkashov. As members advance, they may attain the rank of spodvizhniki (literally archaic, high-style for \\"co-workers\\" or \\"co-endeavourers\\") and are entitled to wear the insignia and participate in paramilitary training. The most dedicated members advance to the ranks of the soratniki (literally \\"comrades-in-arms\\"), who serve as the leadership of the group. The organisation also worked with businesses, state officials, military and secret services. Supporting businessmen were awarded certificates of merit and other honours. The organization presently avoids direct violations of the law. Some officials have allowed RNU to take part in street patrols and other collaborations with the police; and military training facilities have been made available. Some sympathetic state and industrial officials lent RNU places for meetings, provided facilities to print literature, make uniforms and copy CDs and video cassettes and other materials. Several martial arts classes with RNU instructors associated with state schools were opened. Members of some local RNE groups has been convicted for serious racist crimes, such as the case with the RNE group in Tver which vandalized Jewish and Muslim graves, murdered and assaulted individuals belonging to ethnic minorities, spread racial hatred, among other crimes.https://tvernews.ru/news/80518/ RNE members has threatened magazines and publishers, such as the threats against the Vitebsky Courier for criticizing the President of Byelorussia in 2006.https://naviny.by/rubrics/society/2006/08/12/ic_news_116_257398  History  In 1989, Barkashov was the second in command in Russian National- Patriotic Front Pamyat. His conflict with Dmitri Vasilyev resulted in Barkashov leading, in his words, \\"the most disciplined and active members, dissatisfied with empty talk and theatrical stunts, out of Pamyat\\". In 1990, RNU grew in the face of the economic and social difficulties faced by Russians in the course of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Russian National Unity movement was founded on 16 October 1990 by a splinter group of the National Patriotic Front \\"Memory\\" (NPF \\"Pamyat\\"). It grew from 1990 to 1991. Members have been reported to wear black and camouflage uniforms. The group also adopted a red and white swastika emblem and openly expressed admiration for German national socialism and public celebrations of the rise of the Nazis, although the organization officially denied any support for Nazi ideology. The group was active not only in Russia, but also in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine. The RNU has attempted to unite nationalist groups by organizing Slavonic and then Russian sobors. They met with various groups to pursue common goals, but saw little progress. By the middle of 1993, the RNU had become the most prominent Russian nationalist movement, with a wide network of regional divisions. In addition to engaging in political action, the RNU conducted military drills and tactical training. As the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis unfolded, the RNU militantly supported the Russian parliament over President Boris Yeltsin. In 1993, it also took part in defending and patrolling the White House, the residence of the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation, against the President's troops. Following Yeltsin's victory, the RNU worked illegally for several months. While underground, the movement continued to publish their newspaper Russian Order. The same year, the organization was registered as \\"a club for military and patriotic upbringing\\" and later was recognized by local officials as \\"a volunteer people's self-protection unit\\". To help achieve its goals, the RNU developed a cadre of armed paramilitaries, known as Russian Vityazi, who were trained in the use of small arms and explosives. On 15 October 1995, 304 delegates from 37 regional divisions attended a RNU conference in Moscow. In 1999, Moscow's mayor Yuri Luzhkov, with the support of higher government officials, prohibited the second RNU regional conference from being held in Moscow. However, the RNU continued to organize. In 1999, the Moscow headquarters of the group were closed. During the Second Chechen War, the RNU supported Russian officers accused of crimes in Chechnya. At the peak of its popularity in 1999, RNU was estimated to have 100,000 active members all over Russia by state officials. They are now only a shadow of what they once were and have been inactive and somewhat dormant for many years now. In 2014, RNU members joined pro-Russian forces in Ukraine during the War in Donbass under commandment of Pavel Gubarev.

In addition to a succession of successful plays of his own in the first quarter of the 20th century, Sutro made the first English translations of works by the Belgian writer Maurice Maeterlinck. Life and career Sutro was born in London, the third and youngest son of Sigismund Sutro, a medical practitioner and authority on continental spas and their cures. Sutro senior, who was of German and Spanish Sephardic ancestry, had come to England from Germany as a young man and become a British subject.Hyamson, A M. \\"Sutro, Alfred (1863–1933), playwright and translator of Maurice Maeterlinck\\", ODNB Archive, accessed 4 August 2013 Alfred's grandfather was a rabbi.William D. Rubinstein, Michael Jolles, Hilary L. Rubinstein, The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History, Palgrave Macmillan (2011), p. 971 Sutro was educated at the City of London School and in Brussels. He worked as a clerk in the City and when he was twenty he entered into partnership with his elder brother Leopold, trading as wholesale merchants. In 1894 he married Esther Stella, daughter of Joseph Michael Isaacs, a fruit broker and importer in Covent Garden; her brother, Rufus Isaacs, became a prominent lawyer and politician. Stella Isaacs was a painter, and insisted that Sutro should give up business and earn his living in the arts. The Sutros lived for a time in Paris; among the friends they made there was Maurice Maeterlinck, with whom Sutro established a lifelong friendship. Sutro undertook to translate Maeterlinck's works into English, and it was his versions of The Treasure of the Humble (1897), Wisdom and Destiny (1898) and The Life of the Bee (1901) that introduced Maeterlinck to anglophone readers.\\"Obituary – Mr Alfred Sutro\\", The Times, 13 September 1933, p. 12 Sutro's other Maeterlinck translations, some made jointly with his friend Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, include Aglavaine and Selysette, Joyzelle, The Life of the White Ant, The Buried Temple, Monna Vanna, The Death of Tintagiles, and The Magic of the Stars.\\"Maeterlinck Sutro\\", WorldCat, accessed 4 August 2013 Sutro's own work was chiefly as a playwright. After many false starts he achieved a moderate success in 1895 with The Chili Widow, an adaptation of a French work, made jointly with Arthur Bourchier. His first great success was not for a further nine years, when his mildly satirical comedy The Walls of Jericho was presented at the Garrick Theatre, with Bourchier in the lead. A B Walkley in The Times was not greatly impressed by the play but correctly predicted a long run.\\"Garrick Theatre\\", The Times, 1 November 1904, p. 9 It ran for 423 performances,Gaye, p.1540 and established Sutro among the leading English dramatists. From then until his retirement, Sutro wrote more than twenty plays, most of them popular successes. The Times singled out for mention Mollentrave on Women (1905), The Perfect Lover (1905), The Fascinating Mr Vanderveldt (1906), John Glayde’s Honour (1907), The Barrier (1907), The Builder of Bridges (1908), Making a Gentleman (1909), The Perplexed Husband (1911), The Fire-Screen (1912), The Two Virtues (1914), The Clever Ones (1914), The Choice (1919) and A Man with a Heart (1925). Sutro's biographer Katherine Chubbuck writes that in the 1920s \\"He had been overtaken by a new school of dramatists led by Noël Coward\\". After the poor reception of his final play, Living Together (1929) he retired from the theatre.Chubbuck, Katharine, \\"Sutro, Alfred (1863–1933)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 4 August 2013 Sutro also published a volume of stories (The Foolish Virgins, 1904), a collection of sketches (About Women, 1931), and a volume of memoirs, (Celebrities and Simple Souls, 1933). Sutro died after a few days' illness at his home in Witley, Surrey, on 11 September 1933. His widow died the following year. They had no children.

His television program, John Osteen, ran for 16 years and was broadcast to millions in the U.S. and nearly 50 countries weekly. Life and work Osteen was born in Paris, Texas. He earned a bachelor's degree from John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, and a master's degree from Northern Baptist Seminary. He also held a Doctor of Divinity degree from Oral Roberts University. In his biography, Osteen said he did not begin thinking seriously about God until 1939, after leaving a nightclub he frequented. Within a couple of months, he began preaching in Paris, Texas and was apparently ordained to the gospel ministry shortly before his 18th birthday by a church affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. He served as an Associate Pastor at First Baptist Church in San Diego, Texas after completing his studies at NBTS and by the late 1940s as a minister at First Baptist Church, Hamlin, Texas. Osteen left Hamlin in 1948 to become an itinerant preacher, but within a year he became pastor of Central Baptist Church, Baytown, Texas. During his pastorate of Central Baptist Church, Osteen and his first wife, Emma Jean Shaffer, began to experience marital unrest and subsequently divorced. He married Dolores \\"Dodie\\" Pilgrim on September 17, 1954, and the following year resigned his pastorate. Before long, Osteen again entered pastoral ministry at Hibbard Memorial Baptist Church, Houston, Texas, but left in 1958. That same year, John and Dodie's first daughter Lisa was born with severe health issues. As he wrestled with her circumstance, his theological beliefs began to shift and he had ecstatic religious experiences, based on what he called \\"baptism of the Holy Ghost.\\" A year later, on Mother's Day May 10, 1959, he and Dodie started Lakewood Baptist Church in \\"a dusty, abandoned feed store\\" in northeast Houston as a church for charismatic Baptists. The church soon dropped \\"Baptist\\" from its name and became nondenominational. In the mid-1980s, Osteen launched the Lakewood Bible Institute (LBI), an \\"unaccredited school devoted to biblical training from a charismatic perspective.\\" LBI offered a variety of classes including principles of Bible study, healing, conversion, and prayer. Osteen served as LBI's president until its closure in the late-1980s. =Lakewood Church= Osteen founded Lakewood Church in 1959 in Houston, Texas and developed Lakewood into a body of approximately 15,000 members with active ministries in televangelism, conferences, missionary support, and food distribution. He hosted the weekly John Osteen television program for 16 years, reaching millions in the U.S. and in many other countries with his preaching. On January 23, 1999 he died after a heart attack at the age of 77. His youngest son Joel Osteen later became the pastor, who has expanded his father's church. Lakewood now receives over 52,000 in attendance and reaches millions of people around the world by television and online.

Mary Jane (also known as bar shoes or doll shoes) is an American term (formerly a registered trademark) for a closed, low-cut shoe with one or more straps across the instep. Classic Mary Janes for children are typically made of black leather or patent leather, have one thin strap fastened with a buckle or button, a broad and rounded toebox, low heels, and thin outsoles. Among girls, Mary Janes are traditionally worn with pantyhose or socks or completely without them, and a dress or a skirt and blouse. Among boys (less common), Mary Janes are traditionally worn with socks (or without them as well), short trousers and a shirt. History The family of Prince Oskar of Prussia in 1925: the three boys (aged 10, 8, and 3) are wearing Mary Janes. Children's shoes secured by a strap over the instep and fastened with a buckle or button appeared in the early 20th century. Originally worn by both sexes, they began to be perceived as being mostly for girls during the 1930s in North America and the 1940s in Europe. They were also popular with women in the 1920s. Today, Mary Janes for children, particularly the more classic styles, are often considered semi-formal or formal shoes, appropriate for school (many schools worldwide require that girls wear them with their uniform), religious ceremonies, weddings, visits, and birthday parties for example. More modern styles are also worn in casual settings, however: playgrounds, shopping centres, sports (Mary Jane sneakers), etc. Although less popular than in the past, Mary Janes remain a timeless classic of children's fashion and, for many people, a symbol of girlhood. Moreover, Mary Janes are a preferred accessory of many traditional or folk costumes, such as those of the flamenco female dancer and of the typical woman in Mao's China and the Kims' North Korea. Etymology Mary Jane was a character created by Richard Felton Outcault, \\"Father of the Sunday Comic Strip\\", for his comic strip Buster Brown, which was first published in 1902. She was the \\"sweetheart\\" of the title character Buster Brown and was drawn from real life, as she was also Outcault's daughter of the same name. In Outcault's own words—and his daughter's—she was the only character drawn from life in the Buster Brown strip, although \\"Mrs. Brown\\" did resemble Outcault's wife. In 1904, Outcault traveled to the St. Louis World's Fair and sold licenses to up to 200 companies to use the Buster Brown characters to advertise their products. Among them was the Brown Shoe Company, which later hired actors to tour the country, performing as the Buster Brown characters in theaters and stores. This strategy helped the Brown Shoe Company become the most prominently associated brand with the Buster Brown characters. The style of shoe both Buster Brown and Mary Jane wore came to be known by her name, Mary Jane. Adult styles Modern chunky-heeled Mary Jane shoes While the classic Mary Jane still retains its wide popularity and appeal, platform style Mary Janes have also evolved since the late 1990s, with 1-cm to 3-cm (½-in to 1-in) outsoles and 8-cm to 13-cm (3-in to 5-in) \\"chunky\\" heels, often with exaggerated grommets or buckles. The 1920s-style Mary Janes were a famous part of flappers' ensembles, thus reinforcing the childlike style the flappers had. These styles were especially popular in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s, within punk rock, psychobilly and goth subcultures. Many times the wearers would accent the look with knee-high knit socks in dark- colored stripes or patterns and/or some form of hosiery (stockings/pantyhose), and often complete the look with a plaid, pleated schoolgirl-style skirt. Velma Dinkley, member of the fictional Scooby-Doo gang, is most notably attributed to donning a red pair of Mary Jane shoes. During the early 2000s, block-heeled Mary Jane shoes were popular in the United Kingdom and were fastened by a rectangular chrome buckle and were made under various brand names such as No Doubt, Koi Couture etc. Mary Janes are a popular part of kinderwhore and Lolita fashion. A pump with a strap across the instep may be referred to as a \\"Mary Jane pump\\", although it does not have the low heels or wide toe of the original Mary Jane (and a pump is generally strapless by definition).

The FCNA was founded in 1986 with the goal of developing legal methodologies for adopting Islamic law to life in the West. According to its website, the Fiqh Council traces its origins back to the Religious Affairs Committee of the then Muslim Student Association of the United States and Canada established in the 1960s. In 1980, after the founding of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), the Religious Affairs Committee evolved into the Fiqh Committee of the Islamic Society of North America, and was eventually transformed into the Fiqh Council of North America in 1986. Its 18 members issue religious rulings, resolve disputes, and answer questions relating to the Islamic faith. As outlined in its by-laws, the Council's primary objectives include: \\"To consider, from a Shari'ah perspective, and offer advice on specific undertakings, transactions, contracts, projects, or proposals, guaranteeing thereby that the dealings of North American Muslims fall within the parameters of what is permitted by the Shari'ah.\\" The Council's opinions are not binding.  Fatwas  * Terrorism: In July 2005, the Council issued a fatwa stating that all forms of terrorism against civilians are haram (forbidden under Islamic law), that it is forbidden for Muslims to cooperate with anyone involved in terrorism, and that it is a duty of all Muslims to cooperate with law enforcement to protect civilian lives. * Divorce: No Muslim marriage can be terminated except through the court system of the state in which the Muslim is resident.Muslims on the Americanization Path? Oxford University Press, 2000. p. 76 * Capital Punishment: The Council has issued a fatwa calling for a moratorium on capital punishment in the United States, based on the fact that several of the presupposed requirements for the carrying out of the law, according to Sharia, are not being met in most cases. * Apostasy: The Council issued a fatwa which declared that apostasy could not, on its own, be the grounds for any fixed punishment, especially capital punishment. The fatwa states: \\"The preponderance of evidence from both the Qur’an and Sunnah indicates that there is no firm ground for the claim that apostasy is in itself a mandatory fixed punishment [Hadd], namely capital punishment\\" Criticism Professor Khaled Abou El Fadl, a University of California law professor, said in 2001 that the Council lacked authority among Muslims in the US, in part because it was known for analyzing Islamic law for the American military and media and other non-Muslim organizations rather than responding to the needs of Muslims. Then chairman of the council, Dr. Taha Jabir Alalwani, agreed to some extent about these criticisms saying that the Council had a limited budget and thus could not tackle all the kinds of problems faced by American Muslims.

Education The son of an architect, Aimers was educated at Selwyn House and Lower Canada College before attending Sir George Williams University where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science and McGill University where he earned a Bachelor of Education.https://archive.org/stream/veritasdecember1974selw/veritasdecember1974selw_djvu.txt Teaching career Aimers returned to Selwyn House in 1974, teaching English, History and Political Science and coaching the debating team until he left in 1978. He subsequently taught at a series of private schools across Canada and the United States, including Toronto French School where he taught English from 1998 until 2006.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/sex-abuse- claims-hit-elite-school/article20408617/ Founding the Monarchist League Aimers had been an activist in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada's youth wing and became personally close to former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, serving as his administrative assistant for two summers 1969 to 1970. The two shared a conviction that the government of Pierre Trudeau was undermining the status of the monarchy in Canada. In 1970, while a university student, Aimers and others founded the Monarchist League of Canada in an attempt to galvanize monarchists and shore up support for the institution. Aimers served as its Dominion Chairman from 1970 to 1972 when he left to take a job on Parliament Hill. He resumed his duties as Dominion Chairman in 1975, and led the League until February 4, 2006 when he resigned. Political activities Following his service to Diefenbaker, Aimers worked as administrative assistant to Progressive Conservative Members of Parliament Robert Coates in 1972 and Stanley Schumacher in 1973. He served as national president of the Progressive Conservative Youth Federation in 1977. Aimers resigned from the Progressive Conservative Party in 1978, joining the Liberals, to protest what he called \\"the shafting of Stan Schumacher\\" by the party. Schumacher, a 10-year veteran Member of Parliament lost his bid for renomination after he refused to give up his Bow River riding in favour of PC leader Joe Clark who was losing his own riding due to redistribution. Aimers accused the party's national executive of directing a campaign against Schumacher's renomination bid in order to punish him. Sexual abuse lawsuit In 2009, Aimers's former employer, Selwyn House, settled a class action lawsuit, which had been launched in 2006, agreeing to pay up to $5 million in damages to nearly three dozen men who claimed that they had been sexually abused between 1961 and 1991 by three former teachers – Aimers (who had taught at the school in the 1970s and coached its debating team), Leigh Seville and James P. Hill. As part of the settlement, the school issued a public statement which expressed \\"apologies and regrets to former students who have presented claims asserting any form of sexual abuse during their time at the school.\\"\\"Selwyn House pays up to $5M to settle sex abuse suits\\", The Gazette (Montreal), Friday, July 3, 2009 Aimers had been accused of making sexual advances to students while giving them drugs and alcohol, including one whom he hired as a clerk at the Monarchist League.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/i-dont-want-to-live-with- the-memory-of-this-all-my-life/article20386805/?page=all Aimers denied any wrongdoing but resigned as Monarchist League chairman and signed the settlement agreement that concluded the lawsuit.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/monarchist-league-getting-younger-more- dynamic-say-members-1.997669 NotesExternal links *\\"Sex abuse claims hit elite school\\" (Globe and Mail, February 4, 2006) *\\"'I don't want to live with the memory of this all my life'\\" (Globe and Mail, August 22, 2008) Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian Anglo-Catholics Category:Canadian activists Category:Canadian educators Category:Irish Anglo- Catholics Category:Irish emigrants to Canada Category:Canadian monarchists Category:McGill University alumni ","title":"John Aimers"},{"id":"2495598","text":"Opinio juris sive necessitatis (\\"an opinion of law or necessity\\") or simply opinio juris (\\"an opinion of law\\") is the belief that an action was carried out as a legal obligation. This is in contrast to an action resulting from cognitive reaction or behaviors habitual to an individual. This term is frequently used in legal proceedings such as a defense for a case. Opinio juris is the subjective element of custom as a source of law, both domestic and international, as it refers to beliefs. The other element is state practice, which is more objective as it is readily discernible. To qualify as state practice, the acts must be consistent and general international practice.  State applications  A situation where opinio juris would be feasible is a case concerning self-defense. A condition must be met where the usage of force is limited to the situation at hand. The act of striking an attacker may be done with legal justification; however, legal territory limits the acceptability of such a claim. Even in this case, the usage of force must be acceptable to the conditions of the environment, the attacker, and the physical conditions of the people involved, as well as any weapons or tools used.  International applications  In international law, opinio juris is the subjective element used to judge whether the practice of a state is due to a belief that it is legally obliged to do a particular act.Bederman, David J., International Law Frameworks (New York, New York: Foundation Press, 2001) at 15-16 When opinio juris exists and is consistent with nearly all state practice, customary international law emerges. Opinio juris essentially means that states must act in compliance with the norm not merely out of convenience, habit, coincidence, or political expediency, but rather out of a sense of legal obligation.The full phrase—opinio juris sive necessitatis—is Latin for “opinion (or belief) about whether law or necessity.” In other words, the requirement of opinio juris means that the court should decide whether the state practice has arisen due to a belief that the practice was legally required, or whether it has merely acted out of necessity or convenience. [1] Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice accepts \\"international custom\\" as a source of law, but only where this custom is 1) “evidence of a general practice,” (the objective component) (2) \\"accepted as law.\\" (the opinio juris or subjective component)David Harris, Cases and Materials on International Law, Seventh Edition, Sweet and Maxwell Publishers, 2010. Thus, for example, while it may be observed that heads of state virtually always shake hands when they first meet, it is highly unlikely that they do so because they believe that a rule of international law requires it. On the other hand, a state would almost certainly expect some form of legal repercussions if it were to prosecute a foreign ambassador without the consent of his or her home state, and in this sense opinio juris does exist for the international law rule of diplomatic immunity. Because opinio juris refers to the psychological state of the state actor—asking why the state behaved as it did—it can be difficult to identify and to prove. In practice, a variety of sources tend to be used to demonstrate the existence of opinio juris, including evidence such as diplomatic correspondence, press releases and other government statements of policy, opinions of legal advisers, official manuals on legal questions, legislation, national and international judicial decisions, legal briefs endorsed by the state, a pattern of treaties ratified by the state that all include the same obligation(s), resolutions and declarations by the United Nations, and other sources. In the Paquete Habana case (decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1900 on the question of whether small coastal fishing boats are immune from capture during wartime under customary international law), evidence of opinio juris included medieval English royal ordinances, agreements between European nations, orders issued to the U.S. Navy in earlier conflicts, and the opinions of legal treatise writers. Finally, the context, circumstances, and manner in which the state practice is carried out can also be used to infer the existence of opinio juris. As the ICJ stated in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases of 1969, \\"Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it.\\"North Sea Continental Shelf, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, pp. 3, 45, para. 77. Nonetheless, a state's motives can change over time, and that it is not necessary that opinio juris be a significant impetus for each instance of action. As Judge Lachs wrote in a dissenting opinion in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, \\"At successive stages in the development of the [customary] rule the motives which have prompted States to accept it have varied from case to case. It could not be otherwise. At all events, to postulate that all States, even those which initiate a given practice, believe themselves to be acting under a legal obligation is to resort to a fiction, and in fact to deny the possibility of developing such rules.\\"North Sea Continental Shelf, 1969 I.C.J. 4, 232-33 (Feb. 20) (dissenting opinion of Judge Lachs). As difficult as it can be to prove why an actor did act in a certain way, it is exponentially more difficult to prove why it did not act. For this reason, the necessity of demonstrating that a behavior was prompted by a sense of legal obligation makes it particularly difficult for customary international law to develop around the prohibition of a practice. One important case in the development of modern customary international law theory is the Lotus case, in which France attempted to protest Turkey's assertion of criminal jurisdiction over a French citizen for acts committed on the high seas (outside of Turkey's territory). France presented a number of historical examples to demonstrate that the state of nationality or the state whose flag the ship had flown had exclusive jurisdiction in cases such as this. However, the Permanent Court of International Justice (a precursor to the ICJ) declared that the evidence showed merely that \\"States had often, in practice, abstained from instituting criminal proceedings, and not that they recognized themselves as being obliged to do so; for only if such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom.\\"S.S. Lotus Case, 1927 P.C.I.J. (Ser. A) No. 10 (Fr. v. Tur.). This reasoning was cited approvingly in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, which similarly declined to find the existence of customary law regarding the proper method to delimit territorial claims to the continental shelf extending from the coastline of states bordering the North Sea.North Sea Continental Shelf, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, pp. 3, 45, para. 78. The ICJ also declined to find evidence of customary international law in an opinion on the legality of the use or threat of nuclear weapons, despite what some argued to be uniform state practice. As in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, it found that the mere fact that no state had used nuclear weapons against another state since World War II did not reflect opinio juris. Some states had pointed out that a series of U.N. resolutions had been issued \\"that deal with nuclear weapons and that affirm, with consistent regularity, the illegality of nuclear weapons,\\" and argued that this signified “the existence of a rule of international customary law which prohibits recourse to those weapons.”\\"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons\\" - Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 - General List No. 95 (1995-1998), par. 68. Nonetheless, the ICJ wrote that states possessing nuclear weapons had almost always objected to these resolutions, which strongly suggests that those states did not believe that a customary law prohibiting their use existed. Moreover, it wrote that the non-use of nuclear weapons could actually provide evidence of their \\"use\\" as a deterrent force.\\"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons\\" - Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996 - General List No. 95 (1995-1998), par. 67. This logical framework makes sense for existing norms of customary international law, but it becomes problematic in the context of new or emerging customary rules. If a practice is not currently governed by customary international law, then it is illogical to inquire into a state's beliefs about the legality of engaging in or abstaining from that practice, i.e., to ask whether it believed that its practice was in compliance with a law that does not yet exist. This paradox may be resolved to some extent by the idea of \\"crystallization\\" of customary international law, in which practice and legal obligation evolve jointly and eventually ripen into law. Under one model, this process occurs in three stages: first, some States engage in a given practice for reasons other than a sense of legal obligation (e.g. political expediency, economic gain, courtesy, etc.); next, States reinforce the practice by engaging in it or making claims based upon it, creating loops of reciprocity and reliance based on expectations that the practice will continue; finally, as these relationships expand in number and complexity, they eventually harden into a general rule. In this final stage, as more States become aware of the conduct and actively participate or at least passively acquiesce to the practice, the States' actions begin to be undergirded by a belief that they are complying with an emerging customary rule.

These elongated, predatory fish are distinguished by their long dorsal fins, large mouths, and shiny teeth. They breathe air with gills, which allows them to migrate short distances over land. They have suprabranchial organs, which are primitive forms of labyrinth organs, that develop when they grow older.Pinter, H. (1986). Labyrinth Fish. Barron's Educational Series, Inc., . The two extant genera are Channa in Asia and Parachanna in Africa, consisting of more than 50 species. They are valuable as a food source and have become notorious as an intentionally released invasive species. Description The various species of snakeheads differ greatly in size; dwarf snakeheads, such as Channa orientalis, do not surpass in length. Most other snakeheads reach between . Five species (C. argus, C. barca, C. marulius, C. micropeltes, and C. striata) can reach or more. Snakeheads are thrust-feeders that consume plankton, aquatic insects, and mollusks when small. As adults, they mostly feed on other fish (such as carp) or on frogs. In rare cases, small rodents such as rats are eaten. History The Channidae are well represented in the fossil record and known from numerous specimens. They likely originated in the south Himalayan region of the Indian subcontinent (modern-day northern India and eastern Pakistan) at least 50 million years ago (Mya), during the Early Eocene epoch. Two of the earliest known species, Eochanna chorlakkiensis and Anchichanna kuldanensis , have both been found in the Middle Eocene of Pakistan. By 17 Mya, during the Early Miocene, Channidae had spread into western and central Eurasia, and by 8 Mya, during the late Tortonian, they existed throughout Africa and East Asia. As Channidae are adapted to climates of high precipitation with mean temperatures of 20°C (68°F), their migrations into Europe and Asia correspond to the development of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which increased air humidity, and the intensification of the East Asian monsoon. Both weather patterns emerged due to greater vertical growth of the Alps, Pyrenees, and Himalayas, which affected Eurasian climatic patterns. Ecological concerns Snakehead murrel, Channa striata, Java, Indonesia Snakeheads can become invasive species and cause ecological damage because in many areas to which they are not native, the absence of natural enemies gives them apex predator status. Not only can they breathe air, but they can also survive on land up to four days, provided they are wet, and are known to migrate up to 400 m (1/4 mi) on wet land to other bodies of water by wriggling with their bodies and fins. National Geographic has referred to snakeheads as \\"fishzilla\\" and the National Geographic Channel reported the \\"northern snakehead reaches sexual maturity by age two or three. Each spawning-age female can release up to 15,000 eggs at once. Snakeheads can mate as often as five times a year. This means in just two years, a single female can release up to 150,000 eggs.\\" Video clip titled: \\"The Northern Snakehead fish wreaks havoc\\". \\"Since 2002, it has been illegal to possess a live snakehead in many US states, where they are considered a destructive invasive species.\\" Virginia has criminalized the \\"introduction \\" of snakeheads into the state without specific authorization, although the relevant statute does not explain whether mere importation is sufficient to constitute \\"introduction into the Commonwealth\\" or whether instead release into the environment is required.Code of Virginia § 18.2-313.2: \\"Any person who knowingly introduces into the Commonwealth any snakehead fish of the family Channidae[...] without a permit from the Director of Game and Inland Fisheries [...] is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor [punishable by up to twelve months in jail and/or a fine of up to $2,500].\\" =Intentional introductions= Humans have been introducing snakeheads to nonindigenous waters for over 100 years. In parts of Asia and Africa, the snakehead is considered a valuable food fish, Examples of the introduction of snakeheads to nonindigenous waters include: * Channa maculata was introduced to Madagascar and to Hawaii around the end of the 19th century. It can still be found there today. * Channa striata was introduced to islands east of the Wallace line by governmental programs in the latter half of the 20th century. In Fiji, the introduction failed. * Channa asiatica, which is native to southern China, was introduced to Taiwan and to southern Japan; the origin of and reason for the introduction are unknown. * Channa argus, which is native to northern China's Amur River, was introduced to central Asia (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). It was introduced from the Korean Peninsula to Japan about 100 years ago due to fisheries' motivations. Its introduction to Czechoslovakia by its government in the 1960s failed. =Reported sightings=In the United States Snakeheads became a national news topic in the United States because of the appearance of C. argus, commonly known as northern snakeheads, spawning in a Crofton, Maryland, pond in 2002.Courtenay, Jr., Walter R. and James D.

Called nga yant in Burmese, in Manipuri as ngamu, they are prized fish eaten in a variety of ways. In Vietnam, they are called cá lóc, cá quả, or cá chuối, and are prized in clay-pot, steamed and pickled preparations. Larger species, such as C. striata, C. maculata, and Parachanna obscura, are farmed in aquaculture. In the United States, chefs have suggested controlling the snakehead invasion by serving them in restaurants. In Indonesia, snakehead fish are called ikan gabus, served as the main parts of traditional dishes such as Betawis' pucung gabus, and considered to be a delicacy due to their rarity in the wild and in aquaculture, as they are harder to raise than other popular freshwater fish such as catfish and carp. Channa pleurophthalma Classification The snakeheads comprise three extant genera: * Channa Scopoli, 1777 (49 species native to Asia) * Parachanna Teugels & Daget 1984 (three extant species, one fossil species, all native to Africa) Two other genera are only known from fossils: * †Anchichanna Murray & Thewissen, 2008 (one species) * †Eochanna Roe, 1991 (one species) The genus Aenigmachanna was initially classified in Channidae upon its discovery, but analysis supports it being reclassified into its own family Aenigmachannidae.

Life He was educated at Christ's Hospital, and attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He edited the Delphin Classics, a 143-volume set of Latin works published by Abraham John Valpy at which task his editorial labors were so excessive as to induce near total blindness. He also wrote poetry, and authored a number of tracts on the plight of England's poor and on reform of the political system. Radical He shared many ideas with radical writers of the time. His doctrine of benevolence advised a moral obligation to the poor, during a time when the interest in the lower classes was subsiding. He influenced authors such as William Godwin, but also gave critical and moral support to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. Nicholas Roe's chapter on Dyer in The politics of nature: Wordsworth and some contemporaries shows Dyer to have been an important model for Wordsworth and Coleridge in the way he brought politics to bear on the poetry of nature and imagination. Dyer's influence represents, for Roe the answer to current historians who believe that the Romantics turned their backs on history in their search for a transcendent nature. The poet thus seems to have revenged himself on claims of insignificance. Anecdotes There are a number of stories associated with George Dyer, particularly regarding his myopia and his eccentricities. These stories were told by his friends James Henry Leigh Hunt and Charles Lamb. Lamb in his Elia essay Amicus Redivivus relates an incident in which Dyer, after a visit to the Lamb household in Islington, walked the wrong way on the pathway and went right into the New River, nearly drowning himself in the process. Leigh Hunt tells a similar story regarding Dyer, in which after spending the evening at the Hunts' for dinner, he inadvertently left with only one shoe. Apparently Dyer's missing shoe went unnoticed by him until he arrived home and he returned to the Hunt household after midnight, awakening everyone, to retrieve his missing shoe which was finally located under a table. Another incident relating to Dyer concerns a preface which he wrote for his Poems published in 1802. On rereading one of the first prints of his book, Dyer claimed that there was a significant error in reasoning contained on the first page of the preface. He rushed to the printer and had a number of prints redone at considerable expense.Hunt's Autobiography, the Essays of Elia, the Letters of Charles and Mary Lamb, and The Life of Charles Lamb by E.V.

It represents Rousseau's last venture into political theory. To many readers, The Government of Poland is surprising in the degree to which its recommendations sometimes defy the principles expressed in Rousseau's more famous work, The Social Contract. Contrary to the perception of Rousseau as a radical — a view again largely based on The Social Contract — in The Government of Poland Rousseau displays caution and conservatism: \\"Never forget, as you dream of what you wish to gain, what you might lose.\\" Commission In the early 1770s, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was in a particularly challenging situation, threatened by its neighbors on all sides, particularly Russia, Prussia and Austria. In an attempt to retain independence against the superior military might of the three great powers, some Poles joined together to form the Bar Confederation. One member of the confederation, Michał Wielhorski, approached both Rousseau and Gabriel Bonnot de Mably to submit suggestions for the reformation of Poland's unique \\"Golden Liberty\\", which had deteriorated from a semi-republican, semi-democratic political system into a state of virtual anarchy. Mably's recommendations were completed in two installments, the first in August 1770 and the second in July 1771. Generally, he called for more radical and substantial changes than Rousseau was to suggest; he was also able to finish his recommendations in a more timely fashion than Rousseau. It was not until 1772 that Rousseau completed his essay. By the time he finished, the First Partition of Poland had already occurred, on February 17, 1772. Russia, Prussia and Austria had invaded and occupied much of Poland. The Government of Poland was not published until after Rousseau's death. Structure and recommendations The work is divided into fifteen chapters of greatly varying length. The original is in French, Rousseau's native language, but there exist translations into a number of languages. Among other issues, Rousseau addresses his belief that small states can prosper while large states slip into anarchy or despotism. He recommends that surpassing any constitutional reforms, the most important reform Poland could make would be the adoption of a federal system. Specifically, Rousseau advocates a federation of the existing voivodships. In recommending the creation of smaller states, Rousseau recognizes the imminent First Partition with the words: \\"If you wish to reform your government, then, begin by narrowing your frontiers, though perhaps your neighbors intend to do that for you.\\" Within Rousseau's oeuvre While The Social Contract is considered Rousseau's most important political commentary, his attempts in The Government of Poland to apply the principles described The Social Contract to concrete problems elucidate the major work. Besides The Government of Poland, the only other work in which he attempts this is the Constitutional Project for Corsica (see also Corsican Constitution), a work which is only fragmentary. Thus, The Government of Poland provides perhaps our best perspective on how Rousseau believed his overarching principles could be applied to realistic situations. As Rousseau's last political work, the essay can also be viewed as the final culmination of his political thought. Rousseau's work influenced the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791, the world's second modern codified constitution. Content Will Durant writes: References Further reading  * Richard Fralin.

Biography He was born on September 16, 1852, in Brooklyn, New York City. His father was Rudolph Lexow (1823–1909) who was born in Germany. His mother was born in England and had died prior to 1880. His siblings include: Charles K. Lexow (1850–1928) who was a lawyer in 1880; Allen Lexow (1855–?) who was a banker in 1880; and Rudolf Grant Lexow (1865–?). He studied abroad and at the Columbia Law School, where he graduated in 1872. He was admitted to the bar and established his practice in New York City, where he had many German-American clients. In 1880 Clarence was living in Clarkstown, Rockland County, New York with his parents, and he was already a lawyer. Rudolph Lexow, his father was working as an editor. Clarence and Charles also appear as living in Manhattan in the Benedict Building at 79 Washington Place in New York City. In 1882, he became a resident of Nyack and was active in the Republican Party there. In 1890 he was an unsuccessful nominee for Congress. Though Lexow was unsuccessful, the majority for the Democratic victor was lower than had been usual. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1894 to 1898, sitting in the 117th, 118th (both 16th D.), 119th, 120th and 121st New York State Legislatures (all three 23rd D.). Here he at once took a leadership role, and was chairman of the committee on internal affairs and introduced the bi- partisan police bill calling for an investigation of the New York City Police. This led to the appointment, in 1894, of the Lexow Committee, of which he was head. The committee documented how Tammany Hall leaders and the police extorted bribes from operators of gambling and prostitution houses. He was a Senator from the 16th District from 1894 to 1895; and the 23rd District from 1896 to 1898. Lexow was also the introducer of the bill creating the city of Greater New York, was chairman of the joint legislative committee for the investigation of trusts and unlawful combinations, of the committee on primary elections reform, and of the judiciary committee. In 1896, he was chairman of the committee on resolutions at the Republican State convention and introduced the gold standard plank in the platform; in 1900, he was a presidential elector, voting for William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. He died in 1910, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, Nyack, New York.

IIIT publishes a research monograph series and The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences and offers a master's degree in Islamic Studies along with a master's program for imams. According to Faruqi, \\"Islamization of knowledge' does not mean subordination of knowledge to dogmatic principles, but rather in the words of The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, \\"testing every truth claim by internal coherence, correspondence with reality, and enhancement of human life and morality.\\" IIIT's founders maintain that the global Muslim community is experiencing \\"an intellectual crisis.\\" IIIT's approach is to address this crisis \\"through critical examination of Muslim heritage\\" along with an effort to integrate the study of Islamic scriptures—the Qur’an and Sunnah (Prophet Muhammad's examples)—and human knowledge acquired through the humanities, social and natural sciences. To that end, the IIIT advocates \\"reform of education in Muslim societies (and elsewhere) that takes into account these integrated approaches to knowledge.\\" This also includes constructive engagement with Jewish and Christian faith traditions, which was pioneered by IIIT founder al-Faruqi who in 1979 convened a gathering of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim scholars described as \\"a Trialogue of Abrahamic Faiths.\\" In 1981, IIIT published a book with this title.

Since 1981 IIIT has published over six hundred titles in English and Arabic, and translated and published more than 400 titles in over 35 languages. The subject matter has covered Islamic studies, intellectual development in Islamic thought, humanities, social sciences, maqasid al- Shariah, apostasy, parenting, and the advancement of education in Muslim societies. In addition, the underlying ethical, faith-based prescriptions that mark out IIIT publications embody a universal moral code that aims at the general welfare and betterment of humanity. Taking these factors into account, IIIT seeks and welcomes new ideas and encourages critical thinking. = Advancing Education in Muslim Societies (AEMS) = IIIT's core research programme is Advancing Education in Muslim Societies (AEMS), focusing on educational research in areas of curriculum, pedagogy, leadership, policy, and monitoring and evaluation. Its vision is to promote \\"thriving Muslim societies in which individuals achieve their fullest potential through transformative learning, social development and personal growth.\\" This is achieved by conducting and disseminating \\"theoretical and empirical research to empower Muslim societies with data-driven policy recommendations while fostering societal and individual development through transformative learning.\\" AEMS aims to \\"empower a new generation of Muslim intellectuals, educators and academics.\\" IIIT has partnered with American University's International Training and Education Program to offer a master's degree program toward AEMS focusing on social emotional learning as a means for \\"educational reform in Muslim societies.\\" IIIT has also partnered with Indiana University Press to publish a peer-reviewed academic journal and book series. Although AEMS is focused on enhancing Muslim societies, this also geared toward enhancing Muslim contributions to civilization and humanity at large. AEMS aims to \\"transform education systems and enhance people's well-being so they can proactively help build both their societies and a civilization of peace and prosperity for all.\\" = Strategic Engagement Unit = IIIT runs a Strategic Engagement Unit designed to help governments, school systems, higher education institutions, and private educational foundations implement programs to \\"improve educational outcomes in the third space... defined as education for meaningful living which offers psychological and emotional stability, social and relational fulfilment along with purposeful and impactful economic, community, and political engagement.\\" = Policy Department = IIIT's Policy Department seeks to identify gaps in current policies and aims to offer potential solutions for educational practices to be transformative, so that \\"education is a means for advancing holistic human development.\\" Its focus is on modernizing and reforming education policy in the Muslim world, and works with education policy reform experts and stakeholders, including policy advisors, governmental officials, academics, teachers, and parents. = The Fairfax Institute (TFI) = The IIIT runs The Fairfax Institute as its principal training arm. Its main aims are \\"continued education, community outreach, and inter-faith dialogue\\". TFI provides enrichment courses, training workshops, seminars, and career development programs to achieve these goals. =Mapping the Terrain Study Data - 2018-2019= The annual report 2018-2019 provides an analysis and a discussion of the results of the “Mapping the Terrain” study which included over 25,000 participants from fifteen countries. It explored how secondary school and university students, parents, teachers, and administrators view values such as empathy, forgiveness, moral reasoning, and community-mindedness. The report was presented on November 19, 2019 at the American University in partnership with the School of Education’s International Training and Education Program (ITEP). This report and others after will generate a discussion on the implications for advancing education in Muslim societies. Sami Al-Arian and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Just like many Islamic organizations after 9/11, On March 20, 2002, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials raided the Institute and closed the Institute temporarily. The agents were seeking evidence that the Institute was contributing to terrorists, and seized about 25 computers and documents that included financial records, mailing lists, and staff lists .Markon, Jerry, \\"Muslim Anger Burns Over Lingering Probe of Charities\\", The Washington Post, October 11, 2006, accessed January 27, 2010 The search was part of a larger FBI-Customs Service series of raids that included 19 other business and non- profit entities known as Operation Green Quest. \\"Such a massive ream of documents came out of those search warrants,\\" one law enforcement official said, \\"it takes incredibly lengthy investigative work.\\" The lawsuit was finally dismissed against IIIT, as nothing was found. The raids led to the convictions of two people, including Abdurahman Alamoudi, who worked for the SAAR Foundation. Alamoudi admitted that he plotted with Libya to assassinate the Saudi ruler and was sentenced to 23 years in jail But no link of his work to IIIT was found.Markon, Jerry, \\"Witness Is Silent in Terror Probe; Ex- Professor Says Grand Jury Testimony Would Endanger Him,\\" The Washington Post, November 14, 2006, accessed January 27, 2010Gerstein, Josh, \\"Judge Dismisses Suit Questioning Federal Tactics,\\" New York Sun, November 8, 2007, accessed January 27, 2010Gerstein, Josh, \\"A Prosecutor Is Called 'Relentless',\\" New York Sun, July 28, 2008, accessed January 27, 2010 A leader of the Institute, Iqbal Unus, his wife and daughter brought suit charging that their rights were violated and the government was guilty of assault, trespass, and false imprisonment when their home was searched in the raid. A federal judge dismissed the suit, however. The lawsuit had also named a terrorism researcher, Rita Katz, as a defendant, but the judge dismissed her from the case and awarded her $41,000 in legal fees. The Institute was a one time donor to Sami Al-Arian's now-defunct World and Islam Studies Enterprise, a \\"think tank\\" shut down after the FBI confiscated its files in 1995. That think tank raised money for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which the State Department labeled a terrorist group in 1995.Jacoby, Mary, \\"Muslims denounce raids linked to Al-Arian,\\" St. Petersburg Times, March 22, 2002, accessed January 26, 2010Miller, Judith, \\"A Nation Challenged: The Money Trail; U.S. Raids Continue, Prompting Protests,\\" The New York Times, March 22, 2002, accessed January 26, 2010 Al-Arian pleaded guilty in 2006 to helping a terrorist organization, and was sentenced to 57 months in prison.

Attorneys for the Institute claimed that the raid violated its free speech and privacy rights, and asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Theresa C. Buchanan to order the boxes of records returned. But on May 4, 2002, the Judge found that the investigative agents had acted properly, and declined to lift her order sealing the affidavits, though she urged prosecutors to return seized property as soon as possible.Masters, Brooke A., \\"U.S. Magistrate Denies Muslim Groups' Request; Return Sought of Property Seized in Va.\\", The Washington Post, May 4, 2002, accessed January 27, 2010 In October 2002, Virginia Representative James P.

Negotiations between Temple and the Institute broke down after trustees and others pressed Temple to reject the gift.

In May 1998 ABC News, in pursuit of an interview with Bin Laden, had communicated with Mohammad Atef and were directed to Tarik Hamdi as a person who could connect them to Osama Bin Laden. ABC connected with Tarik Hamdi at his place of employment at IIIT. ABC was able to get the interview. Hamdi was able to deliver a satellite phone battery pack that according to federal agents was used three months later in the bombing of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. It took until 2005 for Tarik A.

His third-highest contributor was the International Institute of Islamic Thought.

The full title in English is John Milton an Englishman His Defence of the People of England.Title so translated in John Alvis, ed., Areopagitica and Other Political Writings of John Milton, Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1999. . P. 99. It was a piece of propaganda,For examples of Milton's writings at this time being termed propaganda, see the \\"Life of John Milton\\" at luminarium.org (\\"For his propaganda writings, Milton had to go into hiding, for fear of retribution from the followers of King Charles II\\"); and R. Page Arnot's 1921 review of Leon Trotsky's Terrorism and Communism at marxists.org (where Arnot says \\"Trotsky achieves a miracle of compression and propaganda....For any parallel we have to go back to John Milton's 'Defensio pro Populo Anglicano'\\"). and made political argument in support of what was at the time the government of England. Background This work was commissioned by Parliament during Oliver Cromwell's protectorate of England, as a response to a work by Claudius Salmasius entitled Defensio Regia pro Carolo I (\\"Royal Defence on behalf of Charles I\\"). Salmasius argued that the rebels led by Cromwell were guilty of regicide for executing King Charles. Milton responded with a detailed justification of the parliamentary party.Michael Bryson, \\"Background for the Defense of the English People,\\" located here. Style The work includes invective against Salmasius and accusations of that scholar's inconsistency for taking contradictory positions. Milton also claims Salmasius wrote his work only due to being bribed with a \\"hundred Jacobuses\\" by the exiled son of Charles, who would later become King Charles II of England.Alvis, p. 264. The level of ad hominem attack is high and much unlike what one would expect from a serious contemporary debater even on a controversial topic.See the section of Bryson's \\"Background\\", cited above, headed \\"Milton's Use of Invective in Defense of the English People\\" for examples. Here is an excerpt from the beginning of Chapter VIII,Alvis, pp. 253–4. where Milton sarcastically asks Salmasius what concern the latter has with what the English do among themselves: Despite the level of insult employed, Milton's polemic provided an effective response, both rhetorically and argumentatively, to Salmasius' volume.The appraisal in the 1907 Nuttall Encyclopædia of General Knowledge is that Salmasius' defense \\"proved a failure, and provoked from Milton a crushing reply.\\" As John Alvis notes, Milton \\"ridicule[s] his adversary for having changed sides in a controversy, for meddling in the affairs of a nation foreign to him, and for having written in the pay of the son of the king he champions.\\"Alvis, p. 98 (editor's introductory note). At the same time, some critics such as George Saintsbury in the Cambridge History of English and American Literature have condemned this work and Milton's later Defensio secunda, asserting that they show, in Saintbury's words, \\"a good deal of bandying of authority and of wearisome rebutting on particular points.\\"A.

Further controversy Salmasius published no response during his lifetime, but a fragment of a reply was printed posthumously. A long anonymous reply, Pro Rege et Populo Anglicano, appeared later, in 1651 at Antwerp; this was authored by a royalist clergyman, John Rowland. It was answered on Milton's behalf by his nephew John Phillips, although Milton is reported to have given his nephew's work \\"Examination and Polishment\\" before publication.Barbara K.

It is an expanded limited edition of Cantrell's Degradation Trip album, which was released five months earlier. All the songs were written long prior to the first release of Degradation Trip. The title was taken from the song \\"Solitude\\", the fifth track from the album. Roadrunner Records, uneasy toward the idea of a double album release, made Cantrell condense it, but promised to eventually release all of his material. The track order of the expanded version, which differs from the first, is also presented in Cantrell's originally planned order. Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin and then-Ozzy Osbourne/Black Label Society bassist Robert Trujillo (formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and later of Metallica) contributed to Degradation Trip, and would tour with Cantrell in support of it in 2001, before the album was released. The album was released on vinyl for the first time through Music on Vinyl on February 8, 2019, with a limited edition of 2.000 individually numbered copies on quadruple color vinyl. Recording and background The liner notes for Degradation Trip Volumes 1 & 2 include an article by Don Kaye entitled \\"A Long, Strange Trip.\\" This describes the album's style and features quotes from Cantrell regarding its development and final release as a double album. Cantrell described the initial plans for the album: :\\"We probably had thirty-plus ideas - it could have been a triple record, you know what I mean? When I was making the record, my co-producer actually gave me George Harrison's triple record (All Things Must Pass), which is one of the coolest things anyone's ever given me. So yeah, this was intended to come out as Degradation Trip Volumes 1 & 2.\\" Label executives commended Cantrell's ambition but were uneasy about the idea of a double album. As Cantrell had already spent a year searching for a label that would take his album, he compromised and condensed his work on the promise that later on it would be released in its entirety.Kaye, Don. \\"A Long, Strange Trip\\" Degradation Trip Volumes 1 & 2 (November 26, 2002). Retrieved on 6-20-09. For about four months in 1998, Cantrell locked himself in his home to write the 25 songs. He noted that much of the writing was inspired by the demise of Alice in Chains, describing it as \\"a situation where I had to move on, and not really being happy about it... So it was just coming to grips with all that stuff – and I'm still doing it, especially now that Layne's gone.\\" Consequently, Degradation Trip boasts dark themes and bleak visuals. \\"It's the hardest record, in some ways, that I've done,\\" Cantrell declared. \\"It's definitely the most lyrically brutal one. Sonically, it's right up there with Dirt as far as viciousness goes.\\" Songs like \\"Pig Charmer\\" and \\"Bargain Basement Howard Hughes\\" are often interpreted as being about the relationship between Cantrell and Staley. \\"Pig Charmer\\" has the lines \\"It turns out he's a big pussy, Satan hoof had its way\\". \\"Satan hoof\\" was the nickname that Staley gave to Cantrell – as mentioned during his interview with Rockline in 1998, while Staley was on the phone. \\"Owned\\" and \\"Pro False Idol\\" question the career of Cantrell and his status as a musician, while \\"Feel the Void\\" and \\"31/32\\" explore the concept of lives wasted. Cantrell elaborated, \\"Throughout the process of making this record, I often wondered at times whether I was insane or not. Sitting here, thinking back on it now, I probably had my moments.\\" He also noted, however, the satisfaction in having released the album as he wanted and being able to put all of the intimate expression to bed.

Sarno (March 15, 1921 – April 26, 2010) was an American film director and screenwriter. Sarno emerged from the proto-pornographic sexploitation film genre of the 1950s & 1960s; he had written and directed approximately 75 theatrically released feature films in the sexploitation, softcore and hardcore genres as well as a number of shot-on-video features for the 1980s hardcore video market. Early life Sarno was born in 1921 and grew up in Amityville on Long Island. Career Sarno, a pioneer of the sexploitation film genre, completed his first adult-oriented feature, Nude in Charcoal, in 1961. Among his best-known films in the genre are Sin in the Suburbs (1964, which was about wife swapping), Flesh and Lace, The Swap and How They Made It (1966, in which his wife appeared), and Moonlighting Wives (1966). Sarno's work of the sexploitation period was typified by stark chiaroscuro lighting, long takes, and rigorous staging. He was also well known for scenarios centering on issues of psycho-sexual anxiety and sexual identity development. During his sexploitation period, Sarno worked with such actors as Uta Erickson, Dyanne Thorne (star of the Ilsa series), Audrey Campbell (Olga's House of Shame series), Michael Alaimo, Patricia McNair, Tod Moore, and his cousin, Joe Santos, who would become a regular on television's The Rockford Files. Beginning in 1968, Sarno's work became somewhat more explicit, predicting the emergence of soft-core. His breakthrough feature Inga (1968) was one of the first X-rated films released in the United States. Other noteworthy soft-core features include Vibrations (1968), Passion in Hot Hollows (1969), Daddy, Darling (1970), Young Playthings (1972), Confessions of a Young American Housewife (1974, which was about foursomes), and Misty (1975). Sarno was also the director of Deep Throat Part 2 (1974), the R-rated sequel to the hardcore classic Deep Throat. After 1968, Sarno's soft-core work was divided between films produced in the United States and films produced in Europe, principally Sweden, Germany, and Denmark. Many of Sarno's European features were made with American backing. In Europe, he was known for having worked with actresses Marie Liljedahl, Christina Lindberg, Helli Louise, and Marie Forså. Sarno's first hardcore feature was Sleepyhead (1973) featuring Georgina Spelvin and Tina Russell. Reluctant to be associated with the hardcore genre, Sarno began directing explicit films under various pseudonyms, like \\"Karl Andersson\\" in Touch of Genie (1974). He acknowledges being the uncredited director of such adult features as Inside Jennifer Welles (1977) starring Jennifer Welles and Deep Inside Annie Sprinkle (1981) starring Annie Sprinkle. Over the course of his hardcore career, Sarno worked with such adult film stars as Harry Reems, Eric Edwards, Jamie Gillis, Marc Stevens, Marlene Willoughby, Gloria Leonard, Sonny Landham, Seka, and Ron Jeremy. Personal life and death Sarno married Peggy Steffans, who was younger than he and was a non-sex performing actress and costumer in some of his films, and they had a son. Sarno died of natural causes on April 26, 2010 at the age of 89 in his native New York City. Critical reputation Singled out for praise by critic Andrew Sarris during the 1970s, Sarno's work has been acknowledged in recent years by tributes at the New York Underground Film Festival, the Torino Film Festival in Turin, Italy, the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, and The Andy Warhol Museum. Sarno has had a tribute at the British Film Institute in London and has given an honorary lecture at Lund University in Sweden. His career is being researched for a comprehensive biography by film historian Michael J. Bowen. Virgile Iscan interviewed Joe Sarno and his wife shortly before Sarno's death in 2010. The interviews appear in Iscan's documentary The Divine Joe Sarno. A Life in Dirty Movies is a 2013 Swedish documentary about Sarno and his wife, and their attempt to make one last film.

They are also common at oil or gas extraction sites having oil wells, gas wells, offshore oil and gas rigs and landfills. In industrial plants, flare stacks are primarily used for burning off flammable gas released by safety valves during unplanned over-pressuring of plant equipment. (See Chapter 11, Flare Stack Plume Rise).\\"A Proposed Comprehensive Model for Elevated Flare Flames and Plumes\\", David Shore, Flaregas Corporation, AIChE 40th Loss Prevention Symposium, April 2006. During plant or partial plant startups and shutdowns, they are also often used for the planned combustion of gases over relatively short periods. At oil and gas extraction sites, gas flares are similarly used for a variety of startup, maintenance, testing, safety, and emergency purposes. In a practice known as production flaring, they may also be used to dispose of large amounts of unwanted associated petroleum gas, possibly throughout the life of an oil well.Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR), World Bank, October 2011 Brochure. Overall flare system in industrial plants Schematic flow diagram of an overall vertical, elevated flare stack system in an industrial plant. When industrial plant equipment items are over-pressured, the pressure relief valve is an essential safety device that automatically release gases and sometimes liquids. Those pressure relief valves are required by industrial design codes and standards as well as by law. The released gases and liquids are routed through large piping systems called flare headers to a vertical elevated flare. The released gases are burned as they exit the flare stacks. The size and brightness of the resulting flame depends upon the flammable material's flow rate in joules per hour (or btu per hour). Most industrial plant flares have a vapor-liquid separator (also known as a knockout drum) upstream of the flare to remove any large amounts of liquid that may accompany the relieved gases. Steam is very often injected into the flame to reduce the formation of black smoke. When too much steam is added, a condition known as \\"over steaming\\" can occur resulting in reduced combustion efficiency and higher emissions. To keep the flare system functional, a small amount of gas is continuously burned, like a pilot light, so that the system is always ready for its primary purpose as an over-pressure safety system. The adjacent flow diagram depicts the typical components of an overall industrial flare stack system: *A knockout drum to remove any oil or water from the relieved gases. *A water seal drum to prevent any flashback of the flame from the top of the flare stack. *An alternative gas recovery system for use during partial plant startups and shutdowns as well as other times when required. The recovered gas is routed into the fuel gas system of the overall industrial plant. *A steam injection system to provide an external momentum force used for efficient mixing of air with the relieved gas, which promotes smokeless burning. *A pilot flame (with its ignition system) that burns all the time so that it is available to ignite relieved gases when needed.Product Overview Ignition Systems, Smitsvonk, November 2001. Excellent source of information about flare stack pilot flames and their ignition systems. *The flare stack, including a flashback prevention section at the upper part of the stack. Crude oil production flares North Dakota Flaring of Gas When petroleum crude oil is extracted and produced from oil wells, raw natural gas associated with the oil is brought to the surface as well. Especially in areas of the world lacking pipelines and other gas transportation infrastructure, vast amounts of such associated gas are commonly flared as waste or unusable gas. The flaring of associated gas may occur at the top of a vertical flare stack or it may occur in a ground-level flare in an earthen pit (as in the adjacent photo). Preferably, associated gas is reinjected into the reservoir, which saves it for future use while maintaining higher well pressure and crude oil producibility.Leffler, William (2008). Petroleum Refining in Nontechnical Language. Tulsa, OK: PennWell. p. 9. Advances in satellite monitoring, along with voluntary reporting, have revealed that about 150 × 109 cubic meters (5.3 × 1012 cubic feet) of associated gas have been flared globally each year since at least the mid 1990s until 2020. In 2011, that was equivalent to about 25 percent of the annual natural gas consumption in the United States or about 30 per cent of the annual gas consumption in the European Union. At market, this quantity of gas—at a nominal value of $5.62 per 1000 cubic feet—would be worth US$29.8 billion.Annual Energy Review, Table 6.7 Natural Gas Wellhead, Citygate, and Imports Prices, 1949-2011 (Dollars per Thousand Cubic Feet), United States Energy Information Administration, September 2012. Also, the waste is a significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions. Biogas flares Flare Stack igniting biogas from sewage sludge digesters at a sewage treatment plant in Ontario, Canada. An important source of anthropogenic methane comes from the treatment and storage of organic waste material including waste water, animal waste and landfill. Gas flares are used in any process that results in the generation and collection of biogas. As a result, gas flares are a standard component of an installation for controlling the production of biogas. They are installed on landfill sites, waste water treatment plant and anaerobic digestion plant that use agriculturally or domestically produced organic waste to produce methane for use as a fuel or for heating. Gas flares on biogas collection systems are used if the gas production rates are not sufficient to warrant use in any industrial process. However, on a plant where the gas production rate is sufficient for direct use in an industrial process that could be classified as part of the circular economy, and that may include the generation of electricity, the production of natural gas quality biogas for vehicle fuel or for heating in buildings, drying Refuse Derived Fuel or leachate treatment, gas flares are used as a back-up system during down-time for maintenance or breakdown of generation equipment. In this latter case, generation of biogas cannot normally be interrupted and a gas flare is employed to maintain the internal pressure on the biological process. There are two types of gas flare used for controlling biogas, open or enclosed. Open flares burn at a lower temperature, less than 1000 °C and are generally cheaper than enclosed flares that burn at a higher combustion temperature and are usually supplied to conform to a specific residence time of 0.3s within the chimney to ensure complete destruction of the toxic elements contained within the biogas. Flare specification usually demands that enclosed flares must operate at >1000 °C and <1000 °C; this in order to ensure a 98% destruction efficient and avoid the formation of NOx. Environmental impacts Flaring of associated gas from an oil well site in Nigeria. Flaring gases from an oil platform in the North Sea. Flare, Bayport Industrial District, Harris County, Texas Methane's estimated global warming potential is 34 times greater than that of CO2. Therefore, to the extent that gas flares convert methane to CO2 before it is released into the atmosphere, they reduce the amount of global warming that would otherwise occur. However, flaring emissions contributed to 270 Mt CO2 in 2017 and reducing flaring emissions is key to avoid dangerous global warming. An increasing number of governments and industries are committing to eliminate flaring by 2030. Improperly operated flares may emit methane and other volatile organic compounds as well as sulfur dioxide and other sulfur compounds, which are known to exacerbate asthma and other respiratory problems. Other emissions from improperly operated flares may include, aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylenes) and benzo(a)pyrene, which are known to be carcinogenic. A 2013 study found that gas flares contributed over 40% of the black carbon deposited in the Arctic, thus further increasing the rates of snow and ice melt. Flaring can affect wildlife by attracting birds and insects to the flame. Approximately 7,500 migrating songbirds were attracted to and killed by the flare at the liquefied natural gas terminal in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada on September 13, 2013.7,500 songbirds killed at Canaport gas plant in Saint John (online CBC News, September 17, 2013). Similar incidents have occurred at flares on offshore oil and gas installations.Seabirds at Risk around Offshore Oil Platforms in the North-west Atlantic, Marine Pollution Bulletin, Vol. 42, No. 12, pp. 1,285–1,290, 2001. Moths are known to be attracted to lights. A brochure published by the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity describing the Global Taxonomy Initiative describes a situation where \\"a taxonomist working in a tropical forest noticed that a gas flare at an oil refinery was attracting and killing hundreds of these [hawk or sphinx] moths. Over the course of the months and years that the refinery was running a vast number of moths must have been killed, suggesting that plants could not be pollinated over a large area of forest\\".The Global Taxonomy Initiative - The Response to a Problem (scroll down to the section entitled \\"Pollinating moths\\") The Bhopal disaster exemplifies the consequences of a failure to flare escaping methyl isocyanate gas. The gas was released from an over-pressured tank to a detached flare tower by a safety valve, and flooded the surrounding area.

Ramón is regarded as a national hero in the Dominican Republic. The Order of Merit of Duarte, Sanchez and Mella is partially named in his honor. Early life Mella was born to Antonio Mella Álvarez (1794-1837) and Francisca Javier Castillo Álvarez (1790-1864). Leader for independence He contributed significantly during 1844 Dominican War of Independence against Haiti, and was involved in the storming of St. Giles Fort by Dominican forces. He was a member of the First Republic's provisional governing board, convened 26 February 1844. Leader of the Dominican independence. In 1838, sixteen years after the entire island of La Hispaniola unified under the Republic of Haiti, Mella participated with other Dominican patriots (most notably Juan Pablo Duarte and Francisco del Rosario Sánchez) in founding La Trinitaria, a secret society with the aim of overthrowing the regime of Haitian president Jean-Pierre Boyer. Subsequently Mella came into contact with the Haitian opposition leader Charles Hérard, who in turn led the reform movement. Together they managed to topple Boyer in 1843, but immediately Hérard imprisoned Mella in Port-au- Prince (Haiti). However, in this very city a rebellion erupted against Hérard, who was only able to dominate with the help of Mella and the incarcerated veterans whom he freed. Mella and his followers marched up to Santo Domingo, captured the eastern part of the island, and formally declared its independence from Haiti and the proclamation of the Dominican Republic in February 1844. Puerta del Conde It is said that one night of February 27, 1844, when he was reunited with other conspirators at Puerta de La Misericordia (Mercy Gate), Ramón Matías Mella fired a shot to end the hesitation that threatened to bring failure. He fired his blunderbuss and the Patriots marched toward the stronghold of San Gennaro (today Conde Gate), where another patrician, Francisco del Rosario Sánchez, proclaimed to the world the birth of the Dominican Republic.

Biography  Wroe was born in the village of East Bowling, near Bradford, West Yorkshire to a worsted manufacturer and farmer, and baptised in the town. After a rather scanty education, he entered his father's business, but later took a farm. He married and brought up a family of seven children. In 1819 Wroe became ill with a fever and two doctors who attended him considered his life was in serious danger. Wroe asked for a minister to come and pray with him. Although his wife sent for four church ministers, each refused his request. Wroe then asked his wife to read a few chapters of the Bible to him, and after a while, he gradually recovered his bodily health, but his mental distress continued and he \\"wrestled with God\\" day and night for some months. A short time later, Wroe started having visions, and often became blind and unable to speak — on one occasion remaining blind for six days. During these periods, Wroe said, many remarkable events were foretold and revealed to him: the Spirit told him to relinquish his worldly employment, so he devoted his life to travelling and preaching, where he gained many followers and persuaded them that he was a messenger of God. Wroe, although often persecuted and threatened, travelled throughout Europe including Gibraltar, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Scotland, and Wales. He later travelled to the United States, and Australia.Official Christian Israelite Website 2008 He died in Melbourne, Australia, in 1863, aged 81, leaving the church affairs in the hands of his trustees. The Christian Israelite Church was originally set up in Gravesend, Kent, but its headquarters moved to Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, which the church wanted to turn into a \\"new Jerusalem\\". From 1822 to 1831 Ashton-under- Lyne was the church's headquarters. Wroe intended to build a wall around the town with four gateways, and although the wall was never constructed, the four gatehouses were, as was a printing press. Popular opinion in the town turned against Wroe when he was accused of indecent behaviour in 1831, but the charges were dismissed. The Church spread to Australia, where it is still active.Nevell (1994), p. 95. Cultural depictions and legacy Wroe’s life was the basis of a novel, Mr Wroe's Virgins by Jane Rogers. In 1993 Jonathan Pryce featured as Wroe, alongside Kathy Burke and Minnie Driver, in a BBC mini-series adaptation of the novel directed by Danny Boyle. Most of the locations that are associated with Wroe are long gone, although one of his ‘gatehouses’ does survive in the form of former \\"Odd Whim\\" public house in Park Square, Mossley Road, Ashton-under-Lyne, now converted into offices and flats.

Norfolk House was built on a site formerly occupied by two houses, namely St Albans House, the residence of the Earl of St. Albans (purchased by Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk in 1722) the other the residence of John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse (1614–1689) (purchased by the 9th Duke of Norfolk in 1748). Both these houses were demolished in 1748 by the 9th Duke of Norfolk in preparation for his new house. St Albans House St Albans House was a royal residence for a short time, after the 9th Duke of Norfolk offered it to Frederick, Prince of Wales, following his marriage in 1736 to Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. The couple lived there 1737–1741, and their son King George III was born in the house. The family moved to Leicester House in 1742, which remained the prince's home until his death nine years later, and that of his widow until her death in 1772. Norfolk House Norfolk House remained in the ownership of the Dukes of Norfolk until 1938 when it was pulled down and replaced by an office building. During the Second World War this building served as offices for senior officers from a variety of Allied armed forces, including the Canadian 1st Army and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force under General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Two plaques on the exterior of the building commemorate the role of the building in the War. The 1930s building was fully refitted in the years before 2019. The office space became obsolete for modern requirements and in 2019 plans were submitted to demolish it and rebuild at a cost of £60 million in line with modern requirements. =Music Room= Parts of the interior of the eighteenth-century house survive, having been removed before demolition, including the Music Room, designed by Giovanni Battista Borra for the ninth Duke's wife Mary Blount, now displayed in the Victoria and Albert Museum, restored and redecorated to its original scheme of brilliant white paintwork with gilt, carved woodwork.

A typical performance may also include handling the snakes or performing other seemingly dangerous acts, as well as other street performance staples, like juggling and sleight of hand. The practice was historically the profession of some tribesmen in India but this is no longer the case. Snakecharmer performances still happen in other Asian nations such as Pakistan.. Umerkot is one of the centers of the craft in Pakistan. Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and south-east Asian nations like Thailand, and Malaysia are also home to performers, as are the North African countries of Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. Ancient Egypt was home to one form of snake charming, though the practice as it exists today likely arose in India. It eventually spread throughout Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. Despite a sort of golden age in the 20th century, snake charming is today slowly dying out. This is due to a variety of factors, chief among them the enforcement of a 1972 law in India banning ownership of snakes. In retaliation, snake charmers have organized in recent years, protesting the loss of their only means of livelihood, and the government has made some overtures to them. Snake charming is almost extinct in India. Many snake charmers live a wandering existence, visiting towns and villages on market days and during festivals. During a performance, snake charmers may take a number of precautions. The charmer typically sits out of biting range and the snake is sluggish and reluctant to attack anyway. More drastic means of protection include removing the reptile's fangs or venom glands, or even sewing the snake's mouth shut. The most popular species are those native to the snake charmer's home region, typically various kinds of cobras, though vipers and other types are also used. Although snakes are able to sense sound, they lack the outer ear that would enable them to hear the music. They follow the pungi that the \\"snake charmer\\" holds with his hands. The snake considers the person and pungi a threat and responds to it as if it were a predator. History The earliest evidence for snake charming comes from ancient Egyptian sources. Charmers there mainly acted as magicians and healers. As literate and high-status men, part of their studies involved learning the various types of snake, the gods to whom they were sacred, and how to treat those who were bitten by the reptiles. Entertainment was also part of their repertoire, and they knew how to handle the animals and charm them for their patrons. One of the earliest records of snake charming appears in the Bible in Psalm 58:3–5: \\"The wicked turn aside from birth; liars go astray as soon as they are born. Their venom is like that of a snake, like a deaf serpent that does not hear, that does not respond to the magicians, or to a skilled snake-charmer.\\" Snake charming as it exists today probably originated in India. Hinduism has long held serpents to be sacred; the animals are believed to be related to the Nagas, and many gods are pictured under the protection of the cobra. The earliest snake charmers were likely traditional healers by trade. As part of their training, they learned to treat snake bites. Many also learned how to handle snakes, and people called on them to remove snakes from their homes. Baba Gulabgir (or Gulabgarnath) became their guru since his legend states that he taught people to revere the reptiles and not fear them. The practice eventually spread to nearby regions, ultimately reaching North Africa and Southeast Asia. \\"Snakecharmers,\\" a chromolithograph by Alfred Brehm The early 20th century proved something of a golden age for snake charmers. Governments promoted the practice to draw tourism, and snake charmers were often sent overseas to perform at cultural festivals and for private patrons. In addition, the charmers provided a valuable source of snake venom for creating antivenins. Today, cultural changes are threatening the profession of the snake charmer in India. One reason for this is the rise of cable television; nature documentaries have extinguished much of the fear and revulsion once felt toward the animals and thus demystified the snake charmer. Animal-rights groups have also made an impact because of the cruelty of the practice, and the abuse of a number of endangered species. Another factor is urbanisation and deforestation, which have made the snakes upon which the charmers rely increasingly rare. Perhaps the most important reason snake charming is declining in India is that it is no longer legal\\"India's Snake Charmers Work Around Ban\\", NPR, 14 July 2004 following changes to the Wildlife Protection Act. The law was originally passed in 1972, and aimed at preventing the export of snakeskins, introducing a seven-year prison term for owning or selling snakes. Beginning in the late 1990s, however, the law was also applied to the snake charmers. As a result, the charmers were forced to move their performances to less-travelled areas such as small villages or face legal actions. The trade is hardly profitable anymore, and many practitioners must supplement their income by alternative jobs, like working as day labourers. Children of snake charmers increasingly decide to leave the profession to pursue higher-paying work, and many fathers do not try to make them reconsider. Some snake charmers have struck back against this stereotype. In 2003, hundreds of them gathered at the temple of Charkhi Dadri in Haryana to bring international attention to their plight. In December of the following year, a group of snake charmers stormed the legislature of the Indian state of Odisha with their demands while brandishing their animals. The Indian government and various animal-rights groups have now acknowledged the problem. One suggested solution is to train the performers to be snake handlers, capturing and removing venomous snakes from city and suburban gardens. In return, they could sell their traditional medicines as souvenirs. Another proposal would try to focus attention on the snake charmers' music and treat them like other street musicians. Performance Snake Charmers in Varanasi India Snake charmers typically walk the streets holding their serpents in baskets or pots hanging from a bamboo pole slung over the shoulder. Charmers cover these containers with cloths between performances. Dress in India, Pakistan and neighbouring countries is generally the same: long hair, a white turban, earrings, and necklaces of shells or beads. Once the performer finds a satisfactory location to set up, he sets his pots and baskets about him (often with the help of a team of assistants who may be his apprentices) and sits cross-legged on the ground in front of a closed pot or basket. He removes the lid, then begins playing a flute-like instrument made from a gourd, known as a been or pungi. As if drawn by the tune, a snake eventually emerges from the container; if a cobra, it may even extend its hood. In the Western world snake charming is very different. Western style snake charmers use pythons and boa constrictors for their performances as they are not venomous. Western style snake charmers do not use a musical instrument, instead they perform dance routines involving the snakes. Snakes Traditionally, snake charmers use snakes that they have captured themselves in the wild. This task is not too difficult, as most South Asian and North African snakes tend to be slow movers. The exercise also teaches the hunter how to handle the wild reptiles. Today, however, more and more charmers buy their animals from snake dealers. A typical charmer takes in about seven animals per year. The exact species of serpents used varies by region. In India, the Indian cobra is preferred, though some charmers may also use Russell's vipers. Indian and Burmese pythons, and even mangrove snakes are also encountered, though they are not as popular. In North Africa, the Egyptian cobra, puff adder, carpet viper and horned desert viper are commonly featured in performances.Highfield, Andy C. and Bayley, Jane R. \\"Folklore, Myth, and Exploitation of snakes in Morocco and Tunisia\\". Tortoisetrust.org. Section \\"Snakes\\". In The UK, US and Europe pythons and boa constrictors are used to comply with Animal Handling and Animal Welfare Regulations. Except for the pythons, boa constrictor, and mangrove snakes, all of these species are highly venomous.  Safety measures  At home, snake charmers keep their animals in containers such as baskets, boxes, pots, or sacks. For safety, some North African snake charmers stitch closed the mouth of their performing snakes, leaving just enough opening for the animal to be able to move its tongue in and out. Members of the audience in that region believe that the snake's ability to deliver venomous bites comes from its tongue, rather than fangs. Snakes subjected to this practice soon die of starvation or mouth infection, and must be replaced by freshly caught specimens. Similar methods are used in India, where snakes are defanged and have their poison sacks incapacitated. They are then also kept in boxes or bags for 30–45 days and dehydrated so that their muscles cramp (making them sluggish) and so that they will drink the milk offered by devotees at festivals (the milk is undigestible to the snake). Methods of dealing with the fangs include expert surgical removal of both the fangs and replacement fangs, which has been done by some Native American and African snake charmers. Barring extraordinary measures, pulled fangs are replaced within days. Fangs may also be plugged with wax or other material. In West Africa, charmers have been observed to treat the snake's body and mouth with herbs that paralyze the jaw muscles and cause inflammation of the venom glands. Members of the Pakkoku clan of Burma tattoo themselves with ink mixed with cobra venom on their upper body in a weekly inoculation which may protect them from the snake, though there is no scientific evidence of that. Lifestyle Snake charming is typically an inherited profession. Most would-be charmers thus begin learning the practice at a young age from their fathers. Members of the Sapera or Sapuakela castes, snake charmers have little other choice of profession. In fact, entire settlements of snake charmers and their families exist in some parts of India and neighbouring countries. In Bangladesh, snake charmers are typically members of the nomadic ethnic group Bede. They tend to live by rivers and use them to boat to different towns on market days and during festivals. North African charmers usually set up in open-air markets and souks for their performances. In coastal resort towns and near major tourist destinations one can see snake charmers catering to the tourist market, but in most of the region they perform for the local audiences; an important part of their income comes from selling pamphlets containing various magic spells (in particular, of course, against snake bites). In previous eras, snake charming was often the charmer's only source of income. This is less true today, as many charmers also scavenge, scrounge, sell items such as amulets and jewelry, or perform at private parties to make ends meet. Snake charmers are often regarded as traditional healers and magicians, as well, especially in rural areas. These charmers concoct and sell all manner of potions and unguents that purportedly do anything from curing the common cold to raising the dead. They also act as a sort of pest control, as villagers and city-dwellers alike call on them to rid homes of snakes.

It was formerly the country home of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent and is a Grade I listed building. Nether Lypiatt Manor Description Built in the early 1700s by an unknown architect for Judge Charles Coxe, with one wing added in 1931 by Morley Horder, the small house forms a perfect square of 46 feet (14 m) on each side, with sash windows, tall chimneys, hipped roofs and gate piers and railings. The attic storey with dormers was removed in 1844, but replaced by Horder c.1923. It has been praised by architectural historian Mark Girouard as perfectly exemplifying the early eighteenth-century formal house in miniature. The house, in 35 acres (14 ha) of grounds, has four reception rooms, eight bedrooms, and four bathrooms. It comprises four floors, including a tall basement and an attic floor. Inside, much of the early eighteenth-century panelling survives, as do original stone fireplaces. A fine staircase runs from basement to attic. There is a possibility that Nether Lypiatt Manor was the influence for the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg, Virginia. The garden designer Rosemary Verey worked on the gardens of Nether Lypiatt for Prince and Princess Michael.\\"Obituary: Rosemary Verey.\\", The Times, London, 2 June 2001, pg. 25 The grounds have recently been re-developed with a series of new gardens, including a refurbished traditional flower garden in keeping with the original arts and crafts backbone of vistas and hedges. History On the death of Thomas Freame in 1689, his estate at Nether Lypiatt was divided between his two co-heiresses. One, Anne Chamberlayne, obtained the previous house, which stood near to the present house. Her daughter Catherine married judge Charles Coxe (1656–1728), MP for Cirencester and later Gloucester, and circuit judge in Wales, They inherited the house in 1699 and built the present house in the early 1700s. Their son John inherited the house in 1728 after which it passed down in his family until 1914 (though, from 1884, occupied by tenants), when it was bought by Arthur Stanton. He sold it to Mr Corbett Woodall, who commissioned architect Peter Morley Horder to recondition the house, installing bathrooms and planting the avenue of limes to the south. In 1923 it was bought by Gordon Woodhouse and his wife, the harpsichordist Violet Gordon Woodhouse. They added the north-west pavilion and improved the interior.Douglas-Home, Jessica, \\"Violet : The Life and Loves of Violet Gordon Woodhouse\\", 1997 In 1980 it was bought by Prince and Princess Michael.

It was designed by Dragon's Lair creator Rick Dyer, and released in 1991 by Sega. Its plot is that an American old west cowboy named Marshal Gram travels to various timelines to rescue Princess Kyi-La and defeat the evil time lord Vulcor. In 2001, a home version was published by Digital Leisure in PC CD-ROM and standard DVD format. The DVD version includes a red- blue stereographic presentation intended partially to mimic the arcade original. Plot The game's premise is that American old west cowboy Marshal Gram (played by Stephen Wilber, also hired to coordinate the game's stunts) is required to save the universe from scientist turned evil time lord Vulcor, who's found a way to manipulate and distort time itself; and to also rescue Princess Kyi-La (played by LeAnn McVicker) of the Galactic Federation, whom Vulcor is holding prisoner in his quest to disrupt the flow of time. The player must pursue the villain across time through the ages overcoming various obstacles along the way while undoing all the damage done by Vulcor. Gameplay Game screenshot. The gameplay of Time Traveler is similar to that of other laserdisc games such as Dragon's Lair. The player moves a joystick in a specific direction or presses a button at certain points in the game. By entering the correct command, a movie clip plays showing the player's character progression through the game, while the wrong move results in a unique death scene for each segment. The game offers a short tutorial and hints on gameplay. The player controls consist of a 4-way joystick, an action button and a time reversal button. The latter is a feature that allows the player to rewind and repeat the last couple of seconds of a failed segment. This gives the player a second chance to try and escape his death without having to repeat the complete FMV sequence all over again. Between levels, players can buy more time-reversal cubes by inserting more coins into the arcade machine. The game starts with three lives and one time-reversal cube, lasting potentially ten minutes of perfect gameplay. Sometimes the game sequences have intentional latency, and \\"time malfunction\\" is displayed. It has a total of seven levels called \\"time periods\\". Every level consists of randomized FMV sequences within a time era theme such as pre-historic, Middle Ages, the future, and the Age of Magic. As the game progresses players randomly encounter a slot machine mini-game called \\"Hellgate\\" where the player can bet a life to win or lose extra lives or a free credit, or lose the whole game. Development The game's action sequences were filmed in San Diego, California, with forty actors and a small production crew of about five people headed by Producer/Director Mark E. Watson of Fallbrook, California. The game takes place across many iconic settings from different time periods. All the game's footage was shot as if it were a live action movie. Few props were used during filming as the actors had to imagine fantastical locations while being filmed in front of a green screen stage. Some actors performed multiple roles, for example, the same actor played the obese \\"amazon queen\\" in the bonus DVD features and a chainsaw-wielding character in the game. The game's special effects, music and character voices were later added at a special effects studio in Carlsbad, California. The arcade version has two easter eggs: Pressing both game buttons while pressing down on the joystick with a credit on the machine shows Rick Dyer dancing around with his son on his back. Doing the same procedure while pressing up on the joystick shows the game's development team. There are video clips of production footage and interviews on the disc. Arcade design Concave mirror used for the \\"holographic\\" effect One historian called Time Traveler the \\"World's First Holographic Video Game\\"Demaria, Russell and Wilson, Johnny L., The Illustrated History of Electronic Games. 2002. McGraw Hill Publishing. p. 279.. The game uses a special arcade cabinet that projects the game's characters using reflection, making them appear free-standing. The \\"holographic\\" effect is an optical illusion using a large curved mirror and a CRT television set. Characters appear to stand in mid-air as tiny images about five inches (12.7 cm) tall. Time Traveler has a non-standard shape for an upright arcade cabinet. Though the game is played standing up the cabinet is larger and shorter resembling an oversized cocktail design (50\\"H x 43\\"W x 45\\"D) (127 cm x 109.2 cm x 114.3 cm). It doesn't have a monitor but instead uses a flat, dark stage called the \\"Micro-theater\\", which was invented by engineers Steve Zuloff and Barry Benjamin. The Micro-theater is composed of a big concave mirror that lies underneath the stage. This holographic mirror-like optical device was invented by the Japanese firm Dentsu. Along with it, a 20-inch (50.8 cm) Sony TV sits in front of the mirror. The player controls are located on top of the TV equipment. A couple of neon colored geometric blocks placed at the back of the stage serves as the only background for the game. It is decorated with white formica all around and with a tall \\"SEGA Hologram Time Traveler\\" sign on its back. Image:Arcade_closeup_part1.jpgTV set inside the cab. Image:Arcade_complete_view.jpgHologram Time Traveler arcade cabinet DVD release In 2001, the game was published by Digital Leisure in PC CD-ROM and standard DVD formats. These home versions have the option to simulate the mirror reflection of the original arcade cabinet through a pair of anaglyph stereoscopic glasses. This adds a whirlpool-like moving background to provide an illusory stereoscopic effect. As with other Digital Leisure DVD releases, the game's box advertises being \\"Playstation 2 [or Xbox] Compatible\\" on the cover to attract console owners. Bonus features include interviews with creator Rick Dyer about the making of Time Traveler, as well as some of the actors in the game. It also shows behind the scenes footage from some of the scenes without the special effects. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Time Traveler on their November 15, 1991 issue as being the eighth most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. According to archived news video footage from TV stations in California, US, the game was considered a financial success for Dyer's company Virtual Image Productions and SEGA, earning an average of US$1 million per week during its peak at the arcades. The game's commercial life was not long. With fighting games such as Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat becoming extremely popular, SEGA released the game Holosseum as a conversion kit for the arcade cabinet about a year after Time Travelers release. Dyer considered making a sequel, or adapting the technology for use in casino machines. British gaming magazine The One reviewed Time Traveller in 1991, calling the holographic effect \\"novel\\" and compares the structure of the game to Dragon's Lair, although stating \\"The difference is, Time Traveller does it better than ever before. All the action has been filmed using real actors ... and lavished with a considerable amount of expensive post-production special effects.\\" The One furthermore praises the variety of the game, noting that the game can take twenty scenes to finish, but there are sixty in the game, allowing different playthroughs to play out differently, and expresses that this is an improvement over other laserdisc games. The One states that \\"Time Traveller plays well and is an exceptionally well polished piece of software. Although the gameplay isn't to my personal taste, a great many people will marvel at the 'hologram' effect, and have a great time getting the girl.\\" The DVD version is the only product to receive a 0/10 score from Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine.

The City School District of the City of New York (the New York City public schools) is the largest school system in the United States, with over 1.1 million students taught in more than 1,800 separate schools. The department covers all five boroughs of New York City, and has an annual budget of nearly 25 billion dollars. The department is run by the Panel for Educational Policy and New York City Schools Chancellor. The current chancellor is Richard Carranza. All of the city is assigned to the NYCDOE school district except for a small section of the Bronx, which is instead assigned to the Pelham Public Schools (with tuition supported by the city government).()  History  As of 2008 the former Tweed Courthouse serves as the DOE headquarters 110 Livingston Street previously served as the DOE headquarters, and for the Board of Education before it The New York State legislature established the New York City Board of Education in 1842. Beginning in the late 1960s, schools were grouped into districts. Elementary schools and middle schools were grouped into 32 community school districts, and high schools were grouped into five geographically larger districts: One each for Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens, one for most of Brooklyn, and one, BASIS, for the rest of Brooklyn and all of Staten Island. In addition there were several special districts for alternative schools and schools serving severely disabled students.Yet Another Reorganization of New York City's Public Schools - Center for New York Affairs On February 3, 1964, in protest over deplorable school conditions and segregation, over 450,000 students boycotted New York City public schools. In 1969, on the heels of additional protests, strikes, and demands for community control, New York City Mayor John Lindsay relinquished mayoral control of schools, and organized the city school system into the Board of Education (made up of seven members appointed by borough presidents and the mayor) and 32 community school boards (whose members were elected). Elementary and middle schools were controlled by the community boards, while high schools were controlled by the Board of Education. In 2002, the city's school system was reorganized by chapter 91 of the Laws of 2002. Control of the school system was given to the mayor, who began reorganization and reform efforts. The community school boards were abolished and the Board of Education was renamed the Panel for Educational Policy, a twelve-member body of which seven members are appointed by the mayor and five by Borough Presidents. Although that legislation itself made no specific reference to a \\"Department of Education of the City of New York\\", the bylaws subsequently adopted by the Board provided that the 13-member body \\"shall be known as the Panel for Educational Policy\\", which together with the Chancellor and other school employees was designated as the \\"Department of Education of the City of New York\\". The education headquarters were moved from 110 Livingston Street in downtown Brooklyn to the Tweed Courthouse building adjacent to New York City Hall in Manhattan. In 2003, the districts were grouped into ten regions, each encompassing several elementary and middle school districts, and part of a high school district. In 2005, several schools joined the Autonomous Zone (later Empowerment Zone) and were allowed to use part of their budgets to directly purchase support services. These schools were released from their regions. In 2007, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Chancellor Joel I. Klein announced the dissolution of the regions effective June 2007, and schools became organized into one of several School Support Organizations. Due to an ongoing power struggle between the Democratic and Republican parties, state senators failed to renew mayoral control of the city's school system by 12:00 a.m. EDT on July 1, 2009, immediately ceding control back to the pre-2002 Board of Education system. Mayor Bloomberg announced summer school sessions would be held without interruption while city attorneys oversaw the transition of power. On August 6, 2009, the state senate ratified the bill returning control of the schools back to the mayor for another six years with few changes from the 2002-2009 mayoral control structure. Since 2009, the NYS Assembly has passed incremental laws keeping NYC Mayoral control over the DOE and the current law is set to expire with the end of Mayor DeBlasio’s term in 2022. ManagementCurriculum= Beginning in 2003, New York City public schools citywide implemented a mathematics \\"core curriculum\\" based on New York State standards for grades K-12. To graduate high school, students must earn at least six credits in mathematics. In order to receive a Regents diploma, students must score at least 65 on a Regents math exam.New York City Department of Education website, visited April 9, 2012, \\"Mathematics,\\" http://schools.nyc.gov/Academics/Mathematics/default.htm =Health and nutrition= The city has started several initiatives to reduce childhood obesity among students, including promoting exercise and improving nutrition in school cafeterias. During Mayor Bloomberg's first term, white bread was entirely replaced with whole wheat bread, hot dog buns, and hamburger buns in cafeterias. In 2006, the city set out to eliminate whole milk from cafeteria lunch menus and took the further step of banning low-fat flavored milks, allowing only skim milk (white and chocolate). The New York City school system purchases more milk than any other in the United States. Although the dairy industry aggressively lobbied against the new plan they ultimately failed to prevent its implementation. In October 2009, the DOE banned bake sales, though some schools continued to have them. The DOE cited the high sugar content of baked sale goods and that 40% of city students are obese. However, vending machines in the schools operated by Frito Lay and Snapple continued to sell high processed empty calorie foods such as Doritos and juices. As part of the DOE's program to create healthy diets among students, Frito Lay was obligated to put Reduced Fat Doritos in machines. The DOE considers Reduced Fat Doritos a healthy snack based on its June 2009 request for healthy snack vending machine proposals. However, the school lunch menu still contained numerous highly processed foods and high sugar content foods including chicken nuggets, French fries, French toast and syrup. This menu also continued to fail to meet the mandatory physical education requirements of the state. The New York State Assembly published a report that the NYCDOE failed to maintain or improve playgrounds, instead turning them into ad-hoc additional classroom space or parking lots. In January 2011, more than 1,100 New York City students from 13 schools were offered morning-after pill and other birth control pill (Reclipsen). The pilot program is called Connecting Adolescents to Comprehensive Health. New York City began to offer free lunch to all students in 2017. =Teachers= Beginning in 2000, after experiments with hiring uncertified teachers to fulfill a massive teacher shortage failed to produce acceptable results, and responding to pressure from the New York State Board of Regents and the No Child Left Behind Act, the DOE instituted a number of innovative programs for teacher recruitment, including the New York City Teaching Fellows, the TOP Scholars Program, and initiatives to bring foreign teachers (primarily from Eastern Europe) to teach in the city's schools. Housing subsidies are in place for experienced teachers who relocate to the city to teach. In the course of school reorganizations, some veteran teachers have lost their positions. They then enter a pool of substitutes, called the Absent Teacher Reserve. On November 19, 2008, the Department and the city's teacher union (the United Federation of Teachers), reached an agreement to create financial incentives for principals of new schools to hire ATR teachers and guidance counselors. =Budget= The Department of Education has an annual budget of nearly $25 billion for its 1.1 million students. According to Census Data, New York spends $19,076 each year per student, more than any other state compared to the national average of $10,560. $3 billion of the budget goes to Non City schools. This includes $1.09 billion to pre-school special education services and $725.3 million for School-Age non DOE contract special education. Another $71 million goes to non public schools such as yeshivas and parochial schools and $1.04 billion is paid for the 70 thousand studentsNew York City Charter School Center, as accessed October 2, 2013. attending charter schools. $4.6 billion of the budget pays for pensions and interest on Capital Plan debt.  Organization  Although the 2002 reform legislationChapter 91 of the Laws of 2002 made no specific reference to a \\"Department of Education\\", the bylaws subsequently adopted by the New York City Board of Education provided that the board \\"shall be known as the Panel for Educational Policy\\", which together with the Chancellor and other school employees was designated as the \\"Department of Education of the City of New York\\". = New York City Panel for Educational Policy = The Panel for Educational Policy has the authority to approve school closings.Phillips, Anna M., 12 With Low State Test Scores Are Put on School Closing List, in The New York Times (Late ed. (East Coast)), December 9, 2011, last updated January 5, 2012, p. A.29, in New York Times (1980 - current) (ProQuest (database)), as accessed March 23, 2013 (subscription may be required). A majority of its membership is appointed by the Mayor. = Community Education Councils = There are 32 councils, with 11 members on each, 2 appointed by Borough Presidents and 9 selected by PTA leaders who are advised by parents who live in the council districts, the local parents acting through an election process conducted online and overseen by the Department of Education. The 2009 election cost $650,000 to conduct and another election was held in 2011. According to Beth Fertig, Community Education Councils are \\"supposed to provide an avenue for parent engagement.\\"Fertig, Beth, Parents Claim City Bungled Community Education Council Elections, on WNYC, May 6, 2011, as accessed March 23, 2013. According to Tim Kremer, head of the New York State School Boards Association, \\"although education councils don't have a lot of power they can play a vital role in vetting budgets and giving feedback on instructional policies.\\" Councils have some veto power.Sangha, Soni, School Rezoning's Border Wars, in The New York Times (Late ed. (East Coast)), November 25, 2012, last updated December 7, 2012, p. MB1, in New York Times (1980 - current) (ProQuest) (database), as accessed March 23, 2013 (subscription may be required). The councils were created in 2002 and their authority was increased \\"a little\\" in 2009, but, according to Fertig, \\"many parents still claim the councils don't matter because decisions are ultimately controlled by the mayor.\\" According to Soni Sangha, the councils are mainly obscure and unknown to many parents, their forums are not well-attended, and they meet with the citywide schools chancellor. Student bodyDemographics= Stuyvesant High School Bayard Rustin Educational Complex, formerly Bayard Rustin High School, now hosts 6 small schools The Bronx High School of Science John Dewey High School's 13 acre campus, Dewey is the only public school in New York City to have a 13-acre campus. A bronze statue is also situated on the campus titled \\"The Key to Knowledge\\" symbolizing progressive education. In October 2018, 1,126,501 students attended New York City public schools, excluding 119,551 students enrolled in charter schools. About 40% of students in the city's public school system live in households where a language other than English is spoken; one-third of all New Yorkers were born in another country. The city's Department of Education translates report cards, registration forms, system-wide alerts, and documents on health and policy initiatives for parents into Spanish, French, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Telugu, Bengali, Urdu, Persian, Arabic, and Haitian Creole. In October 2018, the student population was 42% Hispanic and Latino, 26% African American, 15% Non-Hispanic White, and 16% Asian American. Another 3% were of multiple race categories. Of the students, 20% were disabled, 13% were English language learners, and 73% met the Department's definition of poverty. The specialized high schools tend to be disproportionately Asian. New York's Specialized High School Institute is an after-school program for students in late middle school. It was designed to enlarge the pool of African American and Hispanic candidates eligible for admission to the selective schools by giving them extra lessons and teaching test-taking skills. Unlike other urban school districts (such as San Francisco Unified School District), New York does not use racial preferences (affirmative action) in public school admissions. The School Diversity Advisory Group has recommended that race and socioeconomic status, rather than student aptitude, be the prime considerations in school admissions. In May 2012, the New York Times reported that New York City had the fifth most segregated large city school system, after Chicago and Dallas. Hispanic students are concentrated in Washington Heights and Corona and the greatest segregation existed in black neighborhoods. It further noted that black isolation in schools has persisted even as residential segregation has declined. , the Times said that 11% of the schools in the city system had the majority of non-Hispanic white students, who made up 15% of the system's total student body. In May 2017, the Times published another report in collaboration with Measure of America that examined the effects of segregation. According to the report, black and Hispanic students were more likely to attend nonselective schools with majority-black and Hispanic demographics and lower graduation rates, while white and Asian students were more likely to attend selective or zoned schools with higher graduation rates. The Times also stated that zoned schools with majority white or Asian demographics tended to have higher graduation rates than zoned schools with majority black or Hispanic demographics.Kristen Lewis and Sarah Burd-Sharps. Who Graduates? New Findings on NYC High School Admissions and Graduation Rates. Measure of America, 2017. While the universal high school choice policy in New York City sought to weaken the link between the conditions in students neighborhoods and their educational outcomes, a 2016 report by Measure of America found that on-time graduation rates still vary immensely by where students lived.Kristen Lewis and Sarah Burd-Sharps. High School Graduation in New York City: Is Neighborhood Still Destiny? (2016) Measure of America of the Social Science Research Council. =Alumni= After graduating from high school or leaving the New York City public school system, a number of New York City public school students have gone on to become celebrities, and leaders in various industries including music, fashion, business, sports, and entertainment. Some of the most notable New York City public school alumni include Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Alicia Keys, Stanley Kubrick, Al Pacino, Colin Powell, Lloyd Blankfein, Neil deGrasse Tyson (K - 12), and Jay-Z. Unsurprisingly, art focused schools, including High School of Art and Design and Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School have tended to produce notable artists, actors, and fashion over the past century, while STEM focused schools, including Stuyvesant High School and Bronx High School of Science boast Nobel Prize winners and scientists among their notable alumni. Many now famous alumni also interacted with one another while attending public school together. One particular vocational high school, George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, is widely known in Brooklyn to have helped produce four rap legends. In the 1990s, Jay-Z, Busta Rhymes, DMX, and The Notorious B.I.G. all attended the same school. Similarly, at DeWitt Clinton High School in The Bronx, famed novelist James Baldwin and photographer Richard Avedon both contributed to their school's literary magazine, The Magpie, in the 1930s. InfrastructureSchool buildings= Many school buildings are architecturally noteworthy, in part due to the efforts of C. B. J. Snyder. Since 1988 construction has been in the hands of the New York City School Construction Authority. The Department has closed many failing elementary, middle (intermediate) and high schools. The buildings of some of the larger schools have been turned into \\"Campuses\\" or \\"Complexes\\" in which a number of smaller school entities, educationally independent of each other, co-exist within the building. See: List of Schools in New York City Department of Education =Radio and television stations= The Board operated radio station WNYE beginning in 1938, from studios located within the campus of Brooklyn Technical High School. Television station WNYE-TV went on the air in 1967, with its studios adjacent to George Westinghouse High School in Downtown Brooklyn. The broadcast licenses of both stations were transferred to the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications in 2004.  Analysis and criticism  New York is one of ten major U.S. cities in which the educational system is under the control of the mayor rather than an elected school board. More recently, Mayor Bill de Blasio has received major criticism over his decision to accept proposals by charter schools to co- locate with public schools, specifically Seth Low IS and Cavallaro IS. Many people expressed shock and disappointment at the decision, claiming that co- location leads to congestion of school streets, overcrowded classrooms, strained resources, and a negative impact on children's education. = Mayoral control status = Mayor de Blasio retains control over the New York City Public Schools, due to state lawmakers granting two one year extensions, currently valid through the end of June 2019. The deal includes provisions which require release of more detailed budget information about the New York City schools, according to information sent out by Governor Andrew Cuomo's office. Lawmakers also agreed to give districts until the end of the year to negotiate details of new evaluation systems for teachers and principals. The deal also will allow charter schools to more easily switch between authorizers. That could mean the city's education department, which oversees a number of charter schools (but which no longer accepts oversight of new schools) could see some of these schools depart in the future for oversight by State University of New York or the New York State Education Department. = Bullying lawsuit = In April 2016, a group of 11 students and their families along with the non-profit organization Families for Excellent Schools, filed a federal class action lawsuit against the NYCDOE and Chancellor Farina, alleging that the department did not do enough to prevent bullying in schools. The basis of the suit claimed that the atmosphere inside New York City public schools was depriving students of their right to receive an education free of violence, bullying and harassment. In March 2018, the NYCDOE agreed to settle under the condition that it was required to report bullying incidents into an electronic system within one day, and that parents would also be able to submit school bullying complaints electronically.

It was the home of British prime minister Sir Robert Walpole and, since 1963, has been a royal residence, being leased from the Crown Estate by Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy (born Princess Alexandra of Kent), and, until his death in 2004, her husband, Sir Angus Ogilvy. The main house has six reception rooms and six bedrooms, and it stands in of grounds. The property includes gardens, an 18th-century two-room thatched summer house which gave the main house its name, a gardener's cottage, stabling and other buildings. History The residence was originally built as two houses in 1673 for two Richmond Park Keepers, as Aldridge Lodge. It was enlarged, possibly by William Kent, in 1727 as a home for Sir Robert Walpole. The two houses were joined in 1771 by Sir John Soane and renamed Thatched House Lodge. It had also been known as Burkitt's Lodge. The house was used as a grace-and-favour residence by various members of the Royal Household including General Sir Edward Bowater, and General Lynedoch Gardiner, respectively equerry to Albert, Prince Consort and to Queen Victoria. Sir Frederick Treves retired to the house after he successfully operated on King Edward VII's appendix in 1902. Edward VII awarded use of the house to Sir Edmund Monson on his retirement from Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service in 1905. Thatched House Lodge ceased to be a grace and favour property in 1927. Thatched House Lodge was the home of Wing Commander Sir Louis Greig (equerry to King George VI when he was Duke of York), who was deputy Ranger of Richmond Park from 1932. It was then acquired by the 5th Duke of Sutherland. U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was allotted a suite there during the Second World War. Leasehold details The house was acquired on the open market by Angus Ogilvy through the purchase in 1963 of a sublease of the property from Clare, Duchess of Sutherland; he subsequently purchased the leasehold. The asking price for the sublease was £150,000, a considerable amount at the time. The property was held on a lease from the Crown Estate. In 1994, the Crown Estate granted Ogilvy an extension of the lease, to run for 150 years from 1994. Under the 1994 lease, a premium of £670,000 was payable to the Crown Estate, together with an annual rent of £1,000 for the first 25 years, rising in defined stages every 25 years to £6,000 per annum for the last 25 years. The lease required the leaseholder to put the property \\"in good and substantial repair\\" and to maintain it as such, to preserve the character of the property. According to the National Audit Office report on Thatched House Lodge, \\"considerable sums have been spent during the last 40 years of occupation\\". The leasehold arrangements reflect the fact that the property was acquired by Ogilvy on a purely commercial basis, having acquired the sublease of the property for market value on the open market. The commercial nature of the leasehold is shown by the very considerable premium of £670,000 paid on the 1994 extension of the lease, with all maintenance at the expense of the leaseholder, and no charges resulting to the Crown Estate. Independent advice from a leading firm of chartered surveyors taken by the Crown Estate on the 1994 lease extension used the valuation methods applicable to a leaseholder's statutory rights on renewal of a lease. As the property was acquired in an open market transaction, the leasehold of the property may be sold except in the last five years of the lease. Therefore, although Thatched House Lodge is a royal residence by virtue of being inhabited by Princess Alexandra, it is in fact private property, the sub-lease of which was acquired on the open market, and the leasehold having been bought by Ogilvy. As a result, the property may be sold by the princess or her heirs, subject to the underlying Crown Estate long lease. The property is in an \\"exempted\\" area (Richmond Park) where freehold sales are not available. The leasehold arrangements concerning Thatched House Lodge differ from the arrangements relating to other royal residences leased from the Crown Estate, Royal Lodge and Bagshot Park, leased by the Duke of York and Earl of Wessex respectively. In particular the Crown Estate never made a contribution towards restructuring Thatched House Lodge, as it did in the case of Royal Lodge and Bagshot Park, showing the non- commercial considerations which influenced those leases as opposed to Thatched House Lodge.

Taxonomy The rainbow bee-eater is the only species of Meropidae found in Australia and is monotypic.Gill, F. and D. Donsker, eds. (2020). IOC World Bird List (v 10.1). http://www.worldbirdnames.org/ Its closest relative is most likely the olive bee-eater (Merops superciliosus) of southern and eastern Africa, but molecular phylogenetic analysis place rainbow bee-eater as closest relative with the european bee-eater (M. apiaster). It was first described by John Latham in 1801. The generic name is Ancient Greek merops 'bee-eater' and the specific epithet is Latin ornatus 'ornate, adorned'. Description Rainbow bee-eaters are brilliantly coloured birds that grow to be in length, including the elongated tail feathers, and weighing . The upper back and wings are green in colour, and the lower back and under-tail coverts are bright blue. The undersides of the wings and primary flight feathers are rufous to copper with green edges and tipped with black, and the tail is black to deep violet. The rainbow bee-eater's two central tail feathers are longer than the other tail feathers, and are longer in the male rainbow bee-eaters than in the females. The crown of the head, the stomach and breast, and the throat are pale yellow- orange in color, and it has a black crescent-shaped gorget and a black stripe, edged with blue, extending through its bright red eye. They have small, syndactylous feet (i.e., with toes partly united). The juvenile has a greener crown, lacks throat bands and tail streamers. Distribution and habitat Flying Rainbow bee-eaters are a common species and can be found during the summer in forested areas in most of southern Australia, excluding Tasmania. They migrate north during the winter into northern Australia, New Guinea, and some of the southern islands of Indonesia. A vagrant has been recorded on Miyako Island, Japan. They may be found in open woodlands, beaches, dunes, cliffs, mangroves, and farmlands, and they often visit parks and private gardens.Trusler, P., Kloot, T., and McCulloch, E. M. (1980) Birds of Australian Gardens. Rigby, Adelaide. Behaviour Like all bee-eaters, rainbow bee-eaters are very social birds. When they are not breeding they roost together in large groups in dense undergrowth or large trees. =Vocalization= The rainbow bee-eater makes a series of loud, melodious \\"pir-r-r\\" calls, characterized by rapid vibrating and high pitch, usually in flight. A softer, slower call is exchanged between perching birds. =Nesting= Rainbow bee-eaters are ground nesting birds, like all bee- eaters.Smalley,I.J.,McLaren,S. O'Hara-Dhand,K. (2016) \\"Loess and bee-eaters IV: distribution of the rainbowbird (Merops ornatus) in Australia.\\" Quaternary International, 399: 230-235. doi.10.1016/j.quaint.2015.02.017 Breeding season is before and after the rainy season in the north, and from November to January in the south.Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds.

A. Christie, and E. de Juana, Editors). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.2173/bow.rabeat1.01 Rainbow bee-eaters are believed to mate for life. The male will bring the female insects while she digs the burrow that will be their nest. The bee-eater digs its burrow by balancing on its wings and feet, and digs with its bill, then pushing loose soil backwards with its feet while balancing on its bill. The female bee-eater can dig about three inches down every day. The nest tunnel is very narrow, and the birds' bodies press so tightly against the tunnel walls that when the birds enter and exit their movement acts like a piston, pumping in fresh air and pushing out stale air. Rainbow bee-eaters have also been known to share their nest tunnels with other bee-eaters and sometimes even other species of birds. The female lays between 3 and 7 rounded, translucent white eggs, measuring , which are incubated for about 21 to 24 days until hatching. The young bee-eaters fledge after 28 to 31 days and are fed by both parents, as well as by any other members of the communal group. Cane toads are known to prey on nestlings. =Diet= Photographed at Dayboro, SE Queensland, Australia Rainbow bee- eaters mostly eat flying insects, but, as their name implies, they have a real taste for bees. Rainbow bee-eaters are always watching for flying insects, and can spot a potential meal up to 45 metres away. Once it spots an insect a bee- eater will swoop down from its perch and catch it in its long, slender, black bill and fly back to its perch. Bee-eaters will then knock their prey against their perch to subdue it. Even though rainbow bee-eaters are actually immune to the stings of bees and wasps, upon capturing a bee they will rub the insect's stinger against their perch to remove it, closing their eyes to avoid being squirted with poison from the ruptured poison sac. Bee-eaters can eat several hundred bees a day, so they are obviously resented by beekeepers, but their damage is generally balanced by their role in keeping pest insects such as locusts and hornets under control. =Roe 8 Controversy= Opponents of the Roe 8 project in Perth, Western Australia, claimed that the rainbow bee-eater migrates to the Beeliar Wetlands, which is in the pathway of the Roe Highway extension. Following the 11 March 2017 election, the incoming Labor Government suspended this project and reclamation work by volunteers has begun. Conservation Status The rainbow bee-eater is a common, migratory species with a wide distribution and stable population, which is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

It is now occupied by a charitable foundation which holds residential conferences, lectures and discussions. The gardens of Cumberland Lodge are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.  History of the building  The house was built by John Byfield, an army captain, in 1650 when Oliver Cromwell divided up and sold off lots in Windsor Great Park. The house was called Byfield House until 1670. It was then renamed New Lodge, and at times was also known as Windsor Lodge or Ranger Lodge. After the Restoration, King Charles II made the house the official residence of the Ranger of the Great Park — a Crown appointment always held by someone close to the Sovereign. Among those who have lived at the Lodge were: * Baptist May, the first resident Ranger; * Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (1702–1744); John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough who died there in 1722; * John Spencer (1744–1746); * Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, son of King George II (1746–1765); * Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, son of Frederick, Prince of Wales (1765–1790); * Anne, Duchess of Cumberland and Strathearn, widow of Henry (1790–1803); * George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough (until 1822); * Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, son of King George III (1830–1843); * General William Wemyss of Wemyss, Scottish soldier in the British Army and Member of Parliament died at the lodge in 1852; * Princess Helena, daughter of Queen Victoria and wife of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein (after their marriage in 1866); * Lord Fitzalan of Derwent, last Viceroy of Ireland (1923–1947). During 1936 Cumberland Lodge was used for key meetings between Alexander Hardinge (the King's Private Secretary) and Stanley Baldwin (the Prime Minister), which eventually led to the abdication of Edward VIII.  Cumberland Lodge today  Today Cumberland Lodge is an educational charity. It is used for academic workshops and short residential courses by groups of students, primarily from universities. Their aim is particularly to explore connections in the following areas: International affairs, especially concerning the Commonwealth or Europe; Religion and Ethics; Education; Culture and Society; Law and Order; Media and Society. It is not open to the general public for viewing, however there are open days, conferences and free lectures throughout the year. Various interior and exterior shots of Lodge can be seen in the film The King's Speech. Panoramic image of Cumberland Lodge and associated buildings from the south west.

It originally aired on April 19, 2000. The episode is rated TV-MA in the United States and has a 12 certificate in the United Kingdom. Plot The boys have a new fellow student in their class, the mentally and physically handicapped Timmy, who is only capable of saying his own name, the phrase \\"livin' a lie\\", and otherwise a very limited number of words. Mr. Garrison and Principal Victoria do not realize the extent of Timmy's handicaps, and Mr. Mackey suggests that Timmy may suffer from ADD. They send him to a doctor who diagnoses him with that condition in a very odd fashion (reading The Great Gatsby in its entirety, then asking one random question about a mundane detail from the book). Timmy is then freed from all homework, leading all the other kids in the class to claim that they also have ADD in an attempt to get out of their homework. They are all promptly diagnosed with the condition using a similar method as Timmy, and they are all prescribed Ritalin as a result. Without the burden of homework, Timmy finds a new pastime as he is discovered by The Lords of the Underworld (the rock band consisting of Shelley Marsh's ex-boyfriend, Skyler, and his two friends, as seen in the season three \\"Cat Orgy\\"), which takes him on as its new lead singer. The band becomes instantly successful due to Timmy's antics. However, many people are upset as they think that Timmy is being ridiculed. Phil Collins in particular is displeased with the new band, which has been booked to open for him at the Lalapalalapaza festival. Shortly after, Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld (at this point only referred to as \\"Timmy\\") take Collins's place as the headliners of the festival. The other boys have actually started to take their Ritalin medication, making them very calm and rather boring. Cartman develops a side effect from Ritalin that causes him to see pink Christina Aguilera monsters (one of which causes him to accidentally kill Kenny). The adults are uncomfortable among them, but accept their new kind and obedient children when they also start taking Ritalin. Chef and the pharmacists are the only people left who are not under the drug's influence. Meanwhile, Phil Collins tries to break up Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld. First by appealing to Timmy's parents, Richard and Helen (who also have large heads, use wheelchairs, and unable to say anything other than their names), and later by telling the guitarist, Skyler, that Timmy is stealing his fame and is only holding Skyler back, reminiscing to his Genesis era. Skyler leaves the band, which is subsequently cancelled from the festival. Collins regains his headlining spot, and Skyler's solo project Reach for the Skyler is booked to open for him, but Skyler bails out. In the meantime, Chef tries to convince the parents that there are other methods to fight ADD than medication, namely beating the children to force them to \\"sit down and study,\\" but as the parents are all taking Ritalin too, he does not get any help. After the boys come in and tell Chef that they want to go to the festival to see Phil Collins perform, Chef decides to go confront the pharmacist alone. As the pharmacist and doctor who prescribed the Ritalin are counting their profits, Chef angrily tells them that they are responsible for the children liking Collins. Horrified that they are responsible for this, they make a plan to distribute an antidote called \\"Ritalout\\" by mixing it into free drinks at the Lalapalalapaza festival. They get the drinks from a lemonade stand run by Mr. Derp (a minor character who appeared last in \\"The Succubus\\"). The plan works perfectly; Collins is booed from the stage, and the crowd starts chanting for Timmy. The band reunites with Skyler and they play their show. Timmy even learns the words to introduce the band properly. Collins is carried out of the arena via crowd surfing, with the position of the Oscar implied to have been inserted in his anus. This was shown in a segment which aired during the last 20 seconds of the episode. Cultural references Phil Collins is always seen holding an Academy Award. This refers to his award in 1999 for best song, \\"You'll Be in My Heart\\" (referred to in the episode as \\"You'll Be In Me\\") from Disney's Tarzan, which won against a song from South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, called \\"Blame Canada.\\"Dean, Maury (2003). Rock N' Roll Gold Rush. Algora. p. 574. . Collins' appearance and mannerisms in the episode are similar to the \\"Gumby\\" character as seen in Monty Python's Flying Circus, an influence of Stone and Parker. The characters always mispronounce the name of Lollapalooza, a yearly music event. Kurt Loder is also parodied on an episode of MTV News. Loder ponders why he is still doing this and says, \\"I've got to be the oldest person on this network by at least 40 years.\\" The MTV News logo is seen with its satellite orbiting and the announcer states how the network is so cool they decide what is cool. Legacy The song featured in this episode, \\"Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld\\", is a bonus song in Rock Band. It was also released as a standalone single.https://www.amazon.com/Timmy-Lords-Underworld-Livin- Lie/dp/B00004YBZ3 Production As explained in the FAQ section on the official website, \\"When the year 2000 was coming up, everyone and their brother had '2000' in the titles of their products and TV shows. America was obsessed with 2000, so Trey Parker put '2000' in the titles to make fun of the ubiquity of the phrase.

Its primary concern is how a nation such as People's Republic of China can defeat a technologically superior opponent (such as the United States) through a variety of means. Rather than focusing on direct military confrontation, this book instead examines a variety of other means, including political warfare. Such means also include using legal tools (see Lawfare) and economic means as leverage over one's opponent and circumvent the need for direct military action. Taylor Fravel pointed out a common error in translation of the subtitle of the book. While it was translated and understood in the west by many as \\"China’s Master Plan to Destroy America\\", the actual subtitle was \\"Two Air Force Senior Colonels on Scenarios for War and the Operational Art in an Era of Globalization\\". Source of text The English translation of the book was made available by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service in 1999. Reportedly, the United States Naval Academy wrote to the authors to ask for permission to use this book. The book was then published in English by a previously unknown Panamanian publisher, with the subtitle \\"China's Master Plan to Destroy America\\" and a picture of the burning World Trade Center on the cover. A French translation was published in 2003. The text has been cited by the U.S. government, e.g. on a military website by James Perry who states: > In February 1999, the PLA Literature and Arts Publishing House issued > Unrestricted Warfare, a book written by two PLA air force political > officers, Senior Col Qiao Liang and Senior Col Wang Xiangsui. The venue for > publication and the laudatory reviews of the book in official publications > suggested that Unrestricted Warfare enjoyed the support of some elements of > the PLA leadership. The Western press quoted various sensational passages > from the book and described it in terms that verged on hyperbole. The book > was not a blueprint for a “dirty war” against the West but a call for > innovative thinking on future warfare. Weaknesses of the United States The book argues that the primary weakness of the United States in military matters is that the US views revolution in military thought solely in terms of technology. The book further argues that to the US, military doctrine evolves because new technology allows new capabilities. As such, the book argues that the United States does not consider the wider picture of military strategy, which includes legal and economic factors. The book proceeds to argue that the United States is vulnerable to attacks along these lines. Alternative methods of attack Reducing one's opponent, the book notes, can be accomplished in a number of ways other than direct military confrontation. The book notes that these alternative methods \\"have the same and even greater destructive force than military warfare, and they have already produced serious threats different from the past and in many directions for...national security.\\" =Lawfare= Lawfare, or political action through transnational or non-governmental organizations can effect a policy change that would be impossible otherwise. Because of the international nature of the modern world and activism, it is much easier for nation-states to affect policy in other nation-states through a proxy. =Economic warfare= Owing to the interconnected nature of global economics, nations can inflict grievous harm on the economies of other nations without taking any offensive action. =Network warfare= :see iWar One of the better-known alternatives in this book is the idea of attacking networks. Networks are increasingly important in not only data exchange but also transportation, financial institutions, and communication. Attacks that disable networks can easily hamstring large areas of life that are dependent on them for coordination. One example of network warfare would be shutting down a network that supplies power. If there is a significant failure in the power grid caused by the attack, massive power outages could result, crippling industry, defense, medicine, and all other areas of life. =Terrorism= Another instance of threats to nations within the scope of the concept of \\"unrestricted warfare\\" is terrorism. Terrorism is used by a group to gain satisfaction for certain demands. Even if these demands are not satisfied, a terrorist attack can have vastly disproportionate effects on national welfare. One only has to look at the economic crisis that followed the terrorist attacks against the United States, or the extensive security measures put in place after those same attacks. Terrorism erodes a nation's sense of security and well being, even if the direct effects of the attacks only concern a minute percentage of the population. Defense against unrestricted warfare The authors note that an old-fashioned mentality that considers military action the only offensive action is inadequate given the new range of threats. Instead, the authors advocate forming a \\"composite force in all aspects related to national interest. Moreover, given this type of composite force, it is also necessary to have this type of composite force to become the means which can be utilized for actual operations. This should be a \\"grand warfare method\\" which combines all of the dimensions and methods in the two major areas of military and non-military affairs so as to carry out warfare. This is opposite of the formula for warfare methods brought forth in past wars.\\" Implications As the authors state, the new range of options combined with the rising cost (both political and financial) of waging traditional warfare results in the rising dominance of the new alternatives to traditional military action. A state that does not heed these warnings is in dire shape. In popular culture The novels Foreign Influence, Full Black, and Act of War by Brad Thor are based on this book.

Cheney wrote the group's top 20 hits on the ARIA Singles Chart: \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\" (1997), \\"All Torn Down\\" (1999), \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" (2000), \\"Roll On\\" (2001), \\"One Said to the Other\\" (2003), \\"What's on Your Radio\\" (2005), \\"Wake Up\\" (2006), and \\"White Noise\\" (2008). In 2004, Cheney joined the super group The Wrights which put out a cover version of Stevie Wright's epic 11-minute track, \\"Evie\\" as a single. At the 2009 APRA Music Awards, Cheney won Song of the Year for writing The Living End's track, \\"White Noise\\". In 2005, he married his girlfriend Emma; the couple have two daughters and are co-owners of a recording facility, Red Door Sounds. In 2011, the Cheney family relocated to Los Angeles. BiographyPersonal life= Christopher John Cheney was born on 2 January 1975 and grew up in Wheelers Hill, an outer-eastern suburb of Melbourne. His father is Noel Cheney. At the age of five years, he saw his first rock performance at VFL Park, which was close to his home – it was a gig by United States stadium rockers, Kiss. He attended Jells Park Primary School in between 1981 and 1987 and then Wheelers Hill Secondary College. He later studied Jazz at Box Hill Institute of TAFE between 1994 and 1995. Cheney started playing guitar at the age of six he taught himself how to play by listening to AC/DC cassette tapes over and over and practising what he heard. His major influence was Brian Setzer (Stray Cats), a guitarist and singer- songwriter. On 22 September 2001, Cheney was injured in a car crash where his right leg was crushed and required a rod and three pins. He was initially confined to bed and later used a walking stick for the next six months. He was unable to play the guitar until he was rehabilitated. His future wife, Emma, was also inside the vehicle but escaped with minor injuries. Cheney married Emma in 2005, they have two daughters: Charlie Bella (born 2006) and Scarlett Lyric (born 2008). In October 2010, Chris and Emma, along with his manager Rae Harvey and her partner Woody Annison, opened their own recording studio, Red Door Sounds. On 25 April 2011, his father, Noel, died having been diagnosed with cancer the previous year. Late that year, the Cheneys moved to live in Los Angeles. On their new life in L.A., Cheney remarked: \\"Both our littlies are in school here ... It's everyday life. You get up, mad rush in the morning, school drop-off, I come home, write a few songs, bum around and it's school pick-up again. It's life as we knew it, just in a different country\\". =Music career= Chris Cheney met Scott Owen at Jells Park Primary School and they began their career together in 1992, in a Melbourne band, The Runaway Boys, who took their name from a Stray Cats album, Runaway Boys – which Cheney cites as one of his favourites. The group was a covers band playing Stray Cats and The Clash material. In 1992, the group's first paying gig was at the Richmond Club Hotel and they soon followed with a residency at the nearby Corner Hotel. The Runaway Boys had a succession of drummers, \\"The first two guys, Shane and Grant, were at high school with us and they were never really into 1950s rock'n'roll. We were probably a bit pushy at that point. Grant was happy to play along, but then when high school finished he was ready to move on and go to university\\". Cheney also gigged on guitar in another band, Goodbye Sideburns Forever, though he was not recorded with them. The Living End Chris Cheney and Owen, on piano and double bass, were in The Runaway Boys. In 1994, the pair started to write their own material and were joined by Joe Piripitzi on drums to form The Living End. They released two successive extended plays, Hellbound (1995) and It's for Your Own Good (November 1996), which contained their first radio single, \\"From Here on In\\". The track is co-written by Cheney and Owen. In 1996 while Green Day were touring Australia, The Living End sent their second EP to the band, and supported them on their tour, which then led to radio station, Triple J, playing their first single. Late that year Piripitzi was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey. In September 1997 The Living End issued a third EP, Second Solution / Prisoner of Society, with four of its five tracks written by Cheney. The EP peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It became the highest selling Australian-made single for the 1990s. On 12 October 1998, they released their debut self-titled album, which reached No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It included the singles \\"Save the Day\\" (September 1998), \\"Prisoner of Society\\" (September 1999), and \\"All Torn Down\\". They have since received recognition abroad, playing tours and festivals such as the Warped Tour in the United States and Reading and Leeds Festivals in the United Kingdom. Cheney wrote the group's other top 20 hits \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" (2000), \\"Roll On\\" (2001), \\"One Said to the Other\\" (2003), \\"What's on Your Radio\\" (2005), and \\"Wake Up\\" (2006). On 7 October 2006, Cheney told fellow members of The Living End that he wished to leave the band. He \\"found himself going through a personal and creative crisis ... For the first time he was now also experiencing writer's block\\". However, the crisis passed and Cheney started writing again. In February 2008, under the pseudonym Longnecks, the group trialled the new tracks. In July, The Living End issued another top 20 single, \\"White Noise\\". The related album of the same name followed later that month. On 22 July 2011, they released their sixth studio album, The Ending Is Just the Beginning Repeating, which reached No. 3.The Living End in 2008 – News Article – AbsolutePunk.net Other music projects In 2003, Chris Cheney performed alongside Australian rock veterans You Am I at the Big Day Out in Melbourne. They performed a track by The Clash as a tribute to Joe Strummer. In October 2004 Cheney joined the super group The Wrights which performed a cover version of part one of Stevie Wright's track, \\"Evie – Let Your Hair Hang Down\\", at the ARIA Music Awards. Also in the group were Phil Jamieson (Grinspoon), Nic Cester (Jet), Kram (Spiderbait), and Davey Lane (You Am I). In January the following year, they performed the entire three part 11-minute track at the WaveAid benefit concert, and put it out as a single in February. In November 2007, The Wrights reconvened for another 'one-off' benefit concert, Roosistance, to perform \\"We Can't Be Beaten\\" – originally by Rose Tattoo. In July 2005, Cheney performed a duet with Sarah McLeod (ex-The Superjesus) on her second solo single, \\"Private School Kid\\". On 17 December that year he joined Green Day on stage at the Telstra Dome to play \\"I Fought the Law\\". Cheney was not the Green Day bunny as was rumoured, it was Tré Cool, drummer for Green Day. Also in December, Cheney was a guest on SBS-TV's celebrity music trivia show, RocKwiz, with former Divinyls lead singer, Chrissy Amphlett – they performed \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" as a duet of The Rolling Stones' track. At the 2006 Jack Awards, he played in another super group, The Wrongs. They performed a Rose Tattoo track, \\"Bad Boy for Love\\", as a tribute to Peter Wells, the band's guitarist. In February 2009, Cheney made a guest appearance on stage with the Stray Cats on their Australian Farewell Tour. He performed four songs alongside his childhood heroes, Brian Setzer, Lee Rocker, and Slim Jim Phantom. In August that year, Cheney took part in a series of concerts around Australia along with Tim Rogers (You Am I), Jamieson (Grinspoon), and Josh Pyke to celebrate The Beatles' White Album by performing the work in its entirety. In 2010, Cheney made two solo recordings, \\"Distant Sun\\", a cover of Crowded House's track for a tribute album, He Will Have His Way in November; \\"Street Parade\\", a Christmas song, written by Cheney for a Christmas album by various artists, The Spirit of Christmas 2010. His first work as a record producer was for Melbourne indie rockers, Celadore, in October 2011 with their EP, The Bright and Blue. Also in October, Cheney was a guest on RocKwiz for a second time, he appeared with US-born rocker, Suzi Quatro – he performed \\"Heatwave\\" fronting the in-house band, RocKwiz Orkestra; and then \\"Stumblin' In\\" as a duet with Quatro. In 2017, Cheney filled in for Chris Shiflett on the spring tour of \\"Me First and the Gimme Gimmes\\". Cheney contributed a song, \\"I Won't Let You Down\\" to Jimmy Barnes' 2019 album, My Criminal Record. On 6 September 2019, \\"I Won't Let You Down\\" was released as the album's third single. Equipment Cheney's trademark guitar is a Gretsch White Falcon and he uses mainly distortion and modulation effects. He has his own signature series Gretsch guitars. He is endorsed by Gretsch Guitars and uses a number of Gretsch models, including his new signature model guitar. On tour, Cheney takes about six guitars. He uses four main guitars, and the rest are back-ups for different tunings. He is playing through Wizard Modern Classic 100W heads and Wizard 4x12 cabinets. =Guitars= * Chris Cheney Signature G6126TCC * Gretsch White Falcon 6136 * Gretsch White Falcon 6136 (1990s model) * Gretsch 6120SSLVO ('06 Model) * Gretsch 6116TVP \\"Power Tenny\\" (2006 Model) * Gretsch 6118 Double Anniversary * Various other Gretsch & Gibson Models Discography ;The Living End ;The Wrights * \\"Evie – parts 1–3\\" (February 2005) ;Sarah McLeod * \\"Private School Kid\\" featuring Chris Cheney (July 2005) ;Dead Men Walking * Easy Piracy (2015) ;Various Artists * \\"Distant Sun\\" – He Will Have His Way (November 2010) * \\"Street Parade\\" – The Spirit of Christmas 2010 (December 2010) ;Production work * Celadore – The Bright and Blue (EP, Popboomerang Records/MGM, October 2011) AwardsJack Awards= *Best Lead Guitarist – 2004, 2005, and 2007 *Best Male – 2006 =APRA Award= *2009 Song of the Year – \\"White Noise\\" ReferencesExternal links *Band photo gallery *The Living End's Chris Cheney talks about his eight favorite songs * [ Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:APRA Award winners Category:Australian male singers Category:Australian rock guitarists Category:Australian rock singers Category:Australian multi-instrumentalists Category:Australian punk rock musicians Category:Musicians from Melbourne Category:The Wrights (Australian band) members Category:The Living End members Category:21st-century Australian singers Category:21st-century guitarists Category:21st-century male singers Category:Dead Men Walking members Category:Australian male guitarists ","title":"Chris Cheney"},{"id":"2495978","text":"Mark James Howard (born 29 January 1986) is an English football coach and former player. He works as an assistant coach for American club Oklahoma City Energy, for whom he played for a season before retiring from playing. Career Born in Salford, Greater Manchester, Howard attended Hope High School, Salford, with fellow Manchester United players Phil Bardsley and Mark Redshaw. Howard began his career playing for the Barr Hill Lads Club in Salford. He signed for Manchester United as a junior player, and played a number of years in the youth and reserve teams of the club. Having failed to make an impact in the first team, Howard was amongst seven United players given a free transfer at the end of the 2005–06 season. Howard moved to Danish Superliga champions Brøndby IF, that had recently hired Manchester United reserve team coach René Meulensteen as manager. Howard participated in training sessions and played a friendly match against German team 1. FC Nürnberg, before signing a three-year contract with Brøndby on 28 July 2006. He made his senior debut for Brøndby in August 2006, and played 13 of 18 league games as Brøndby finished in seventh place after the first half of the 2006–07 Superliga season. When Meulensteen left the club in January 2007, new manager Tom Køhlert brought in Danish defender Mikkel Bischoff in contention for Howard's place in the central defence. When Bischoff suffered an injury, Howard proved himself once again and continued in the starting 11 for the rest of the season. He was also a part of the Brøndby team which won the 2006–07 Royal League cup on 15 March 2007. In the final match of the cup, Howard received a penalty kick, which Martin Ericsson converted to a goal, securing Brøndby a 1–0 win over F.C. Copenhagen. Having secured his place in the starting eleven during the first half of the 2007–08 season, Howard was awarded the player of the year in Brøndby on 1 December 2007.

It is a Grade I listed building. The house is situated within the Frogmore Estate, which is itself located within the grounds of the Home Park, Windsor, Berkshire. Half a mile (800 m) south of Windsor Castle, Frogmore was let to a number of tenants until the late 18th century, when it was used intermittently as a residence for several members of the British royal family. Queen Charlotte spent much time on the estate, and it was later the home of Queen Victoria's mother. Although occasionally used as a retreat into the early 20th century, the house has been largely unoccupied since 1872. Queen Mary took a special interest in furnishing the house with family mementos and it is used by the Royal Family to host both private and official events. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex make the nearby Frogmore Cottage on the estate their home when they are in the United Kingdom. HistoryEarly tenants= The Frogmore estate has been under royal ownership since the 16th century and was then leased to a series of Crown tenants. Construction on Frogmore house was not begun until 1680 for tenants Anne Aldworth and Thomas May. Work continued until 1684 and is thought to be the work of Hugh May, an architect employed by Charles II at Windsor Castle and uncle of tenant Thomas May. The house's first royal resident was George FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland, the illegitimate son of Charles II and Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland. The duke died in 1716, but his wife continued to live at Frogmore until her death in 1738. There were a number of successive tenants, including Edward Walpole, until 1792 when George III purchased the house for his wife, Queen Charlotte. =1792–1861= Queen Charlotte used the house as a country retreat for herself and her unmarried daughters. They used Frogmore as a \\"refuge\\" away from court life where they could practise their pastimes of \\"painting, drawing, needlework, japanning, reading and 'botanising'\\". The Queen's interest in botany is reflected in a number of the rooms at Frogmore, including a room decorated with painted flowers by the artist Mary Moser. Great attention was paid to the gardens, where the queen planted a number of Spanish chestnut, laburnum and birch trees and installed a number of follies. When Charlotte died in 1818, she left the house to her daughter Princess Augusta Sophia, who lived there until her death in 1840. The house was in good condition, but to make it fit for royal inhabitants, James Wyatt was employed to enlarge and modernise Frogmore House. Between 1795 and 1804, Wyatt enlarged the second floor, added flanking pavilions to the north and south of the house and extended to make room for a new dining room and library. As part of developing Frogmore's gardens, Queen Charlotte had built a simpler retreat house in 1801, now known as Frogmore Cottage.

During this time the house was subject to a number of alterations. The Duchess's taste differed greatly from Queen Charlotte's and much of the decoration from her time was lost. The house was used regularly between 1841 and the death of the Duchess of Kent in 1861, with Queen Victoria often visiting and a number of private family functions were held there. Victoria wrote of the house: \\"All is peace and quiet and you only hear the hum of the bees, the singing of the birds and the occasional crowing and cackling from the Poultry Yard!\\" =Recent history= Frogmore was used intermittently for the remainder of the 19th century. Princess Alexandra (then Princess of Wales) gave birth to her first child (Prince Albert Victor) at the house in 1864, after which it was the home of Princess Helena, third daughter of Queen Victoria, and her husband Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. Helena and her husband moved to Cumberland Lodge in 1872. From 1902 to 1910, the Prince and Princess of Wales (later George V and Queen Mary) were frequent residents. Louis Mountbatten was born on the estate in 1900. From 1925 until her death in 1953, Mary collected and arranged in the house souvenirs of the Royal Family, describing it as \\"a 'family' souvenir museum as well as a museum of 'bygones' and of interesting odds and ends.\\" During this time, George V allowed his first cousin Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia to live at Frogmore Cottage by 1925 when she was escaping the Russian February Revolution. Xenia was \\"very grateful\\" that her cousin let her stay at Frogmore. By March 1937, Xenia had moved from Frogmore Cottage to Wilderness House in the grounds of Hampton Court Palace. Since 1928, most members of the Royal Family, except for sovereigns and their consorts, have been interred at the Royal Burial Ground, on the Frogmore Estate. In 1997, following the decommissioning of the Royal Yacht Britannia, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh furnished what had previously been Queen Charlotte's library and the Duchess of York's dining room with a selection of items from the vessel. This included a mahogany table constructed for Britannia c. 1950. The house continued to be used by the royal family for entertaining and it was used as a venue for the wedding reception after the marriage of the Queen's grandson, Peter Phillips, to Autumn Kelly in May 2008. Ten years later, it was also used for the reception after the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May 2018. In spring 2019, Prince Harry and Meghan, now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, moved from Kensington Palace into Frogmore Cottage, a 4-bedroom Grade II listed house in the grounds of Frogmore House, in preparation for the birth of their first child. Restoration During the 1980s the house underwent extensive restoration, revealing the lost early 18th-century wall paintings by Louis Laguerre. Work was also done on the Green Pavilion, in an effort to restore it to its appearance during the occupation of Queen Charlotte. Work was done on the cornice, dado and chimneypiece, which retain Wyatt's \\"characteristically crisp detailing.\\" The restorations cost a total of £2.5 million by the time they were completed in 1990.

Field windings are of copper wire, toward the back, on both sides. The rotor's laminated metallic core is gray, with darker slots for winding the coils having high efficiency. The similarly shaped metallic commutator (partly hidden toward the front) has become dark from use. The large brown molded-plastic piece in the foreground supports the brush guides and brushes (both sides), as well as the front motor bearing. The universal motor is a type of electric motor that can operate on either AC or DC power and uses an electromagnet as its stator to create its magnetic field. It is a commutated series-wound motor where the stator's field coils are connected in series with the rotor windings through a commutator. It is often referred to as an AC series motor. The universal motor is very similar to a DC series motor in construction, but is modified slightly to allow the motor to operate properly on AC power. This type of electric motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field coils and the armature (and the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) synchronously with the supply. Hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a consistent direction of rotation, independent of the direction of applied voltage, but determined by the commutator and polarity of the field coils.Herman, Stephen L. Delmar's Standard Textbook of Electricity, 3rd Edition. Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning, 2004. p.998 Universal motors have high starting torque, can run at high speed, and are lightweight and compact. They are commonly used in portable power tools and equipment, as well as many household appliances. They're also relatively easy to control, electromechanically using tapped coils, or electronically. However, the commutator has brushes that wear, so they are much less often used for equipment that is in continuous use. In addition, partly because of the commutator, universal motors are typically very noisy, both acoustically and electromagnetically.Herman, Stephen L. Delmer's Standard Textbook of Electricity, 3rd Edition. Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning, 2004. p.1001 Properties Universal motors' field coils are series wound with the rotor coils and commutator Equivalent circuit Not all series wound motors operate well on AC current.Motors for DC will anyway require laminated rotors, owing to commutation If an ordinary series wound DC motor were connected to an AC supply, it would run very poorly. The universal motor is modified in several ways to allow for proper AC supply operation. There is a compensating winding typically added, along with laminated pole pieces, as opposed to the solid pole pieces found in DC motors. A universal motor's armature typically has far more coils and plates than a DC motor, and hence fewer windings per coil. This reduces the inductance. =Efficiency= Even when used with AC power these types of motors are able to run at a rotation frequency well above that of the mains supply, and because most electric motor properties improve with speed, this means they can be lightweight and powerful. However, universal motors are usually relatively inefficient: around 30% for smaller motors and up to 70–75% for larger ones. =Torque-speed characteristics= Series wound electric motors respond to increased load by slowing down; the current increases and the torque rises in proportion to the square of the current since the same current flows in both the armature and the field windings. If the motor is stalled, the current is limited only by the total resistance of the windings and the torque can be very high, and there is a danger of the windings becoming overheated. The counter-EMF aids the armature resistance to limit the current through the armature. When power is first applied to a motor, the armature does not rotate. At that instant, the counter-EMF is zero and the only factor limiting the armature current is the armature resistance. Usually the armature resistance of a motor is low; therefore the current through the armature would be very large when the power is applied. Therefore the need can arise for an additional resistance in series with the armature to limit the current until the motor rotation can build up the counter-EMF. As the motor rotation builds up, the resistance is gradually cut out. The speed-torque characteristic is an almost perfectly straight line between the stall torque and the no-load speed. This suits large inertial loads as the speed will drop until the motor slowly starts to rotate and these motors have a very high stalling torque.Herman, Stephen L. Delmar's Standard Textbook of Electricity, 3rd Edition. Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning, 2004. p.850 As the speed increases, the inductance of the rotor means that the ideal commutating point changes. Small motors typically have fixed commutation. While some larger universal motors have rotatable commutation, this is rare. Instead larger universal motors often have compensation windings in series with the motor, or sometimes inductively coupled, and placed at ninety electrical degrees to the main field axis. These reduce the reactance of the armature, and improve the commutation. One useful property of having the field windings in series with the armature winding is that as the speed increases the counter EMF naturally reduces the voltage across, and current through the field windings, giving field weakening at high speeds. This means that the motor has no theoretical maximum speed for any particular applied voltage. Universal motors can be and are generally run at high speeds, 4000–16000RPM, and can go over 20,000RPM.Transformers and Motors, by George Patrick Shultz By way of contrast, AC synchronous and squirrel cage induction motors cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency. In countries with 60Hz AC supply, this speed is limited to 3600RPM.Herman, Stephen L. Delmar's Standard Textbook of Electricity, 3rd Edition. Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning, 2004. p.905 Motor damage may occur from over-speeding (running at a rotational speed in excess of design limits) if the unit is operated with no significant mechanical load. On larger motors, sudden loss of load is to be avoided, and the possibility of such an occurrence is incorporated into the motor's protection and control schemes. In some smaller applications, a fan blade attached to the shaft often acts as an artificial load to limit the motor speed to a safe level, as well as a means to circulate cooling airflow over the armature and field windings. If there were no mechanical limits placed on a universal motor it could theoretically speed out of control in the same way any series-wound DC motor can. An advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors which have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. =Disadvantages= A negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator, as well as electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues due to any sparking. Because of the relatively high maintenance commutator brushes, universal motors are best- suited for devices such as food mixers and power tools which are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Another negative aspect is that these motors may only be used where mostly-clean air is present at all times. Due to the dramatically increased risk of overheating, totally- enclosed fan cooled universal motors would be impractical, though some have been made. Such a motor would need a large fan to circulate enough air, decreasing efficiency since the motor must use more energy to cool itself. The impracticality comes from the resulting size, weight, and thermal management issues which open motors have none of. =Speed control= Continuous speed control of a universal motor running on AC is easily obtained by use of a thyristor circuit, while multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). VariationsShunt winding= Universal motors are series wound. Shunt winding was used experimentally, in the late 19th century, but was impractical owing to problems with commutation. Various schemes of embedded resistance, inductance and antiphase cross-coupling were attempted to reduce this. Universal motors, including shunt wound, were favoured as AC motors at this time as they were self-starting. When self-starting induction motors and automatic starters became available, these replaced the larger universal motors (above 1 hp) and the shunt wound. =Repulsion-start= In the past, repulsion-start wound-rotor motors provided high starting torque, but with added complexity. Their rotors were similar to those of universal motors, but their brushes were connected only to each other. Transformer action induced current into the rotor. Brush position relative to field poles meant that starting torque was developed by rotor repulsion from the field poles. A centrifugal mechanism, when close to running speed, connected all commutator bars together to create the equivalent of a squirrel-cage rotor. As well, when close to approximately 80 per cent of its run speed, these motors can run as induction motors. ApplicationsDomestic appliances= Operating at normal power line frequencies, universal motors are often found in a range less than . Their high speed makes them useful for appliances such as blenders, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers where high speed and light weight are desirable. They are also commonly used in portable power tools, such as drills, sanders, circular and jig saws, where the motor's characteristics work well. An added benefit for power tools used by welders is that classic engine-driven welding machines may be a pure DC generator, and their auxiliary power receptacles will still be DC, even though a typical NEMA 5-15 household configuration. The DC power is fine for typical jobsite incandescent lighting and the universal motors in drills and grinders. Many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed , while many Dremel and similar miniature grinders exceed . Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, were an ideal choice for domestic washing machines. The motor can be used to agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature. The motor can also be run up to the high speeds required for the spin cycle. Nowadays, variable-frequency drive motors are more commonly used instead. =Rail traction= Universal motors also formed the basis of the traditional railway traction motor in electric railways. In this application, the use of AC to power a motor originally designed to run on DC would lead to efficiency losses due to eddy current heating of their magnetic components, particularly the motor field pole-pieces that, for DC, would have used solid (un-laminated) iron. Although the heating effects are reduced by using laminated pole-pieces, as used for the cores of transformers and by the use of laminations of high permeability electrical steel, one solution available at the start of the 20th century was for the motors to be operated from very low frequency AC supplies, with operation being common. =Starter motor= Starters of combustion engines are usually universal motors, with the advantage of being small and having high torque at low speed. Some starters have permanent magnets, others have 1 out of the 4 poles wound with a shunt coil rather than series wound coils.

Definitions The Fourier transform of the second-order cumulant, i.e., the autocorrelation function, is the traditional power spectrum. The Fourier transform of C3(t1, t2) (third-order cumulant-generating function) is called the bispectrum or bispectral density. Calculation Applying the convolution theorem allows fast calculation of the bispectrum : B(f_1,f_2)=F^*(f_1+f_2)\\\\cdot F(f_1)\\\\cdot F(f_2), where F denotes the Fourier transform of the signal, and F^* its conjugate. Generalizations Bispectra fall in the category of higher-order spectra, or polyspectra and provide supplementary information to the power spectrum. The third order polyspectrum (bispectrum) is the easiest to compute, and hence the most popular. A statistic defined analogously is the bispectral coherency or bicoherence. Applications Bispectrum and bicoherence may be applied to the case of non-linear interactions of a continuous spectrum of propagating waves in one dimension. Bispectral measurements have been carried out for EEG signals monitoring. It was also shown that bispectra characterize differences between families of musical instruments. In seismology, signals rarely have adequate duration for making sensible bispectral estimates from time averages. Bispectral analysis describes observations made at two wavelengths. It is often used by scientists to analyze elemental makeup of a planetary atmosphere by analyzing the amount of light reflected and received through various color filters. By combining and removing two filters, much can be gleaned from only two filters. Through modern computerized interpolation, a third virtual filter can be created to recreate true color photographs that, while not particularly useful for scientific analysis, are popular for public display in textbooks and fund raising campaigns. Bispectral analysis can also be used to analyze interactions between wave patterns and tides on Earth. A form of bispectral analysis called the bispectral index is applied to EEG waveforms to monitor depth of anesthesia.

It is northeast of King's Lynn, east of the Queen's residence at Sandringham and west of Houghton Hall. Anmer Hall was a wedding gift to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge from the Queen. The current house was built in the 18th century and has formed part of the Sandringham estate since 1898. The house was registered as a Grade II* listed building in 1984 but was later de- listed. History The current late-Georgian house dates from the 18th century, although it may be built around an earlier core. It has two storeys and attic with dormer windows. The long south front comprises 13 bays, and was refaced with red bricks c. 1815. It has 13 ground-floor windows set in blank arches and a semicircular porch on two Tuscan columns, with 11 windows on the first floor. The three central bays are topped by a pediment. The north front is of rubble carrstone and includes four c. 17th-century ogee-headed sashes on the first floor. Renovations c. 1900 added a brick dressed skin to the north front, together with a projecting entrance porch and a tower towards the eastern end, in the corner formed with a carrstone service wing also added c. 1900. The surrounding estate became a scheduled ancient monument in 2003, and includes earthworks marking the sites of buildings from the medieval village of Anmer. The village church, St Mary, lies close to the house, but a short distance away from the modern village. Occupants Anmer Hall was the seat of the Coldham family from at least 1705. The nearby Sandringham estate was bought by Queen Victoria in 1862 as a wedding present for the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, and neighbouring land was added to the estate in subsequent years. In 1896, the Anmer Hall estate was purchased at auction for £25,000 by the famed serial fraudsterRobb, George White-Collar Crime in Modern England: Financial Fraud and Business Morality, 1845-1929, Cambridge University Press, 1992, pp. 105–107 Ernest Terah Hooley before his first bankruptcy. The Prince had attempted to purchase the property prior to Hooley's acquisition. Through an intermediary, the Prince asked Hooley that he be allowed to purchase it from him, ostensibly for his daughter Maud. Hooley agreed, allowing him to buy it at cost in 1898. It has been alleged that a motivation for the Prince's action was to avoid the possibility of Hooley's business promoter Alexander Meyrick Broadley, whom the Prince had earlier forced from society, from becoming a constant guest on the estate, and therefore near-neighbour.La Marquise de Fontenoy (pseudonym of Marguerite Cunliffe-Owen), Chicago Tribune, 8 May 1916 http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1916/05/08/page/6/article/la- marquise-de-fontenoy Together with the Prince's eldest son and an equerry, Broadley had been implicated in the Cleveland Street scandal.Another London Society Leader Gone., The Salt Lake Herald 1 January 1890The West End Scandal: Another Flight, Evening News (Sydney, Australia), Tuesday 14 January 1890, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article108795706 Anmer Hall, shown with new roof, in October 2014 Anmer Hall was leased to John Loader Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby (1877–1969), who was to become Governor-General of the Sudan, Permanent Secretary of the Colonial Office and wartime Ambassador to Dublin.

Etymology This goddess was earlier known as simply Xuannü ().. The name has been variously translated as the \\"Dark Lady\\". or the \\"Mysterious Lady\\". in English. In the late Tang dynasty, the Daoist master Du Guangting (850–933) created the title Jiutian Xuannü (九天玄女), adding \\"[of the] Nine Heavens\\", to refer to the goddess.. She is closely related to Sunü (), who is her divine sister.. Both their names combined, as xuansu zhidao (), signify the Daoist arts of the bedchamber. Stories phoenix (type of creature depicted), holding phosphors and clouds as reins The Yongcheng Jixian Lu (), written by the Daoist master Du Guangting (850–933), contains a biographical account of Jiutian Xuannü. It mentions that Jiutian Xuannü is the teacher of Huangdi and the disciple of Xi Wangmu.. The work relates a story about the goddess appearing before Huangdi during a time when the latter was in conflict with Chiyou. Chiyou had caused a great mist, which was so impenetrable that it obscured day and night. Huangdi would dwell in the mist for several day. Jiutian Xuannü rode a cinnabar phoenix, holding phosphors and clouds as reins, into the great mist. She wore variegated kingfisher-feather garments of nine colors. Huangdi greeted her and received her command. Jiutian Xuannü said: \\"I base myself on the teachings of the Grand Supreme. If you have any doubts, you may question me.\\" Huangdi responded: \\"[Chiyou] is cruelly crossing us. His poison is harming all the black-haired people. The four seas are sobbing. No one can protect his own nature or life. I want the art of winning a myriad victories in a myriad battles. Can I cut the harm facing my people?\\" Thereupon the goddess bestowed various objects and artifacts. The following is a few of the listed items: * The Talismans of the Martial Tokens of the Six Jia Cyclicals and the Six Ren Cyclicals () * The Book by which the Five Emperors of the Numinous Treasure Force Ghosts and Spirits into Service () * The Seal of the Five Bright-Shiners for Regulating Demons and Communicating with Spirits () * The Formula of the Five Yin and Five Yang for Concealing the Jia Cyclicals () * Charts for Grabbing the Mechanism of Victory and Defeat of the Grand Unity from the Ten Essences and Four Spirits () * Charts of the Five Marchmounts and the Four Holy Rivers () * Instructions in the Essentials of Divining Slips () It was subsequently noted that Huangdi was able to defeat Chiyou and ascend to heaven on the basis of the items bestowed by Jiutian Xuannü.. Associations The seal of Jiutian Xuannü, as depicted in the Lingbao Liuding Mifa =Warfare= The association of this goddess with warfare is derived from the Longyu Hetu (), presumably produced during the Xin dynasty.. This text describes the manifestation of the goddess herself in front of Huangdi () during his conflict against Chiyou (): Her intervention in warfare is a common narrative in Daoist texts, such as in texts from the Zhongshu Bu () in the Daozang (). =Martial magic= A set of Daoist text, produced after the Tang dynasty, associate the goddess with magical capabilities, such as the skill of invisibility () and the method of mobilizing the stars of the Northern Dipper to protect the state. The Lingbao Liuding Mifa () specifies that Jiutian Xuannü's magic is martial in origin. Jiutian Xuannü has the ability to magically conceal the body and her power is exercised through the Six Ding Jade Maidens () who are her acolytes. According to the Lingbao Liuding Mifa, the Jade Maidens perform specific tasks during the concealment: the Jade Maiden of Dingmao () conceals one's physical body, the Jade Maiden of Dingsi () conceals one's destiny, the Jade Maiden of Dinghai () conceals one's fortune, the Jade Maiden of Dingyou () conceals one's hun soul, the Jade Maiden of Dingwei () conceals one's po soul, and the Jade Maiden of Dingchou () conceals one's spirit. Achieving invisibility is seen as a military strategy to defeat enemies and protect the state, as the text claims that practitioners must first learn to conceal their bodies if they hope to expel evil and return to righteousness. The goddess and the six maidens together represent the yin force in the universe, which is believed to directly result in the concealment of the body, linking their magic of invisibility with their femininity. The Micang Tongxuan Bianhua Liuyin Dongwei Dunjia Zhenjing (), written in the early Northern Song period, gives an incantation associated with Jiutian Xuannü. By reciting this incantation and performing the paces of Yu (), invisibility to others was said to be achieved. In the Baopu Zi (), written by Ge Hong (b. 283), the paces of Yu are described as elements of the divinatory system of dunjia (, translated \\"Hidden Stem\\") from which the immediate position in the space-time structure of the six ding could be calculated. The six ding are the spirits who are responsible for the position of the irregular gate (), which respresents a rift in the universe. The irregular gate must be approached by performing the paces of Yu and serves as the entrance to the emptiness of the otherworld in which invisibility to evil influences is achieved. The Beidou Zhifa Wuwei Jing () states that Jiutian Xuannü taught the method to mobilize the stars of the Northern Dipper to Yuan Qing (), an official during the transition from the Sui to the Tang dynasty. The method is known as Beidou Shi'er Xing (, translated \\"Twelve Stars of the Northern Dipper\\"). The Shangqing Tianxin Zhengfa (), produced in the Southern Song period, gives an incantation entitled Tiangang Shenzhou (, translated \\"Incantation of the Heavenly Mainstay\\") that accompanies the method. =Longevity= The goddess Jiutian Xuannü appears in several works of physiological microcosmology in which the human body is seen as a microcosm of the universe and where the gods are present within.. These texts locate Jiutian Xuannü along the central median of the body and associate her with the circulation of breath, which nourishes the vital spirit and provides longevity. Jiutian Xuannü appears at least three times in the Huangting Jing (), where the adept is instructed to send down his breath to enter the goddess' mouth.. The Taishang Laojun Zhongjing (), probably dating to the 5th century, mentions that she is \\"located between the kidneys, dressed only in the white of Venus and the brilliant stars. Her pearl of Great Brilliance shines to illuminate the inside of the adept's whole body, so that he can extend his years and not die.\\" In the Laozi Zhongjing (), Jiutian Xuannü is described as one of the three deities who are sitting on divine tortoises. The author comments: \\"The Mysterious Woman is the mother of the Way of the void and nothingness.\\" The text gives instructions to adepts: \\"Close your eyes and meditate on a white breath between your shoulders. In its centre is a white tortoise. On top of the tortoise is the Mysterious Woman.\\" There are two governors beside her, which adepts are instructed to summon by saying: \\"Governor of Destiny and Governor of the Registers, pare so-and-so's name from the death list and inscribe it on the Life List of the Jade Calendar.\\" This ritual therefore points to a procedure in which a long life is promised. Since the 3rd century AD, Jiutian Xuannü has been associated with alchemy.. In Ge Hong's Baopu Zi, it is noted that the goddess Jiutian Xuannü helps prepare elixirs with other deities, that adepts erected altars to the goddess when they create elixirs of metal, and that she had discussed calisthenics and diet with Huangdi. During the Song dynasty, the goddess was closely associated with neidan (inner alchemy). =Sexuality= Most books bearing Jiutian Xuannü's name were about warfare, but there were a few book that were specifically about sex. The Xuannü Jing () and the Sunü Jing (), both dating to the Han dynasty, were handbooks in dialogue form about sex. Texts from the Xuannü Jing have been partly incorporated into the Sui dynasty edition of the Sunü Jing.. From the Han dynasty onwards, these handbooks would be familiar to the upper class. On the other side, during the Han dynasty, Wang Chong had criticized the sexual arts as \\"not only harming the body but infringing upon the nature of man and woman.\\" During the Tang dynasty and earlier periods, Jiutian Xuannü was often associated with the sexual arts. The Xuannü Jing remained a familiar work among the literati during the Sui and Tang dynasties. The Dongxuanzi Fangzhong Shu (), which was likely written by the 7th-century poet Liu Zongyuan, contains explicit descriptions of the sexual arts that was supposedly transmitted from Jiutian Xuannü. The sexual practices, that Jiutian Xuannü supposedly taught, were often compared to alchemy and physiological procedures for prolonging life. In Ge Hong's Baopu Zi, there's a passage in which Jiutian Xuannü tells Huangdi that sexual techniques are \\"like the intermingling of water and fire—it can kill or bring new life depending upon whether or not one uses the correct methods.\\" Development Huxi Townhip on the Penghu Islands The goddess Jiutian Xuannü was actively worshiped by the ancient Chinese, but the extent of the worship would diminish after the Han dynasty. Over the following centuries, she was gradually assimilated into Daoism. During the Tang dynasty, contrary views about Jiutian Xuannü coexisted. In this period, the rise of Daoism gave way to a new imagery of a high goddess of war who won by magical and intellectual means, and who transmitted the arts of immortality. The aspects of sexuality, victory over enemies in warfare, and everlasting life was slowly modified to fit this new image. Moreover, the Daoist Du Guangting attempted to expunge all the heterodox and crude elements from Jiutian Xuannü's popular legends, such as the erotic and sexually-empowering nature of the goddess, to create a new image of a martial goddess that was appropriate for the Shangqing school of Daoism. In the Ming dynasty, Jiutian Xuannü officially became a celestial protectress and was venerated as a tutelary goddess of the state.. In 1493, Empress Zhang (1470–1541), who was the wife of the Hongzhi Emperor, was ordained and her ordination was certified in a scroll entitled The Ordination of Empress Zhang, which contains numerous images of deities (but not Jiutian Xuannü) and an inscription composed by the Daoist master Zhang Xuanqing (, d. 1509) of the Zhengyi school. This inscription ranks Jiutian Xuannü above all other celestial warriors by placing her ahead of the divine categories Generals, Marshals, Heavenly Soldiers, the Six Ding Jade Maidens, and the Six Jia Generals. Furthermore, it granted her the expanded official title Jiutian Zhanxie Huzheng Xuannü (, translated \\"Dark Lady of the Nine Heavens who Slays Evil and Protects Righteousness\\"). The Lingbao Liuding Mifa associates the phrase \\"slaying evil and protecting righteousness\\" () with the goddess and emphasizes that \\"in order to slay evil and return to righteousness, one first needs to know how to become invisible\\" (). The veneration and elevation of Jiutian Xuannü may have had an underlying political rationale, as it positioned an aristocratic family over another. The relationship of Empress Zhang and Jiutian Xuannü closely paralleled the relationship of the Ming emperors and Xuanwu, another important deity in Daoism, which promoted the empress and her family's position in the imperial court. This was during a time of strife between the Zhang family and Zhou family (of Empress Dowager Zhou, the grandmother of the Hongzhi Emperor), the latter who adhered to Buddhism. Jiutian Xiannü is a fertility goddess, which also may have contributed to Empress Zhang's worship of the deity. Appearance Song Gongming encounters Jiutian Xuannü, woodblock print, published in the Rongyu Tang edition of the Water Margin In the Taishang Laojun Zhongjing, Jiutian Xuannü is described as being dressed only in the white of Venus and the brilliant stars, with her pearl of Great Brilliance shining in illumination. When Jiutian Xuannü appeared before Huangdi as narrated in the Yongcheng Jixian Lu, she wore variegated kingfisher-feather garments of nine colors and rode a cinnabar phoenix with phosphors and clouds as reins. The physical appearance of Jiutian Xuannü has been described in a poem that appears in the Rongyu Tang () edition, published in the Ming dynasty, of the novel Water Margin: Popular culture Jiutian Xuannü appears as a character in the 2007 Hong Kong film It's a Wonderful Life, the 1980s Chinese television series Outlaws of the Marsh, and the 1985 Hong Kong television series The Yang's Saga. She is featured in the mobile game Tower of Saviors.

State Route 235 (SR 235) is a north-south state highway in the western portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. Its southern terminus is at US 68 near the small town of Oldtown just north of Xenia, and its northern terminus is at State Route 65 at the Maumee River nearly east of Grand Rapids. Prior to late 1968, it was numbered State Route 69, but was renumbered 235. There are a number of urban legends pertaining to why this renumbering occurred. One is that the number 69 has certain sexual meanings in popular culture, and the signs kept getting stolen. (There were actually numerous cases of people stealing the signs for this route.) Another was that it was too close to Interstate 69 (less than in some areas) and the state decided to avoid the confusion. Route description The portion of SR 235 within Fairborn is designated \\"Army Specialist Jesse Adam Snow Memorial Highway\\", in honor of a Fairborn High School graduate who was killed by enemy fire on November 14, 2010 in Afghanistan. History *1926 – Original route certified; originally routed along its current alignment from Oldtown to Fairborn (which was Fairfield and Osborn in 1926). *March 9, 1932 – Extended north to State Route 4 approximately north of Fairborn along previously unnumbered road. *1969 – Extended north to its current terminus along previous State Route 69. On November 9, 2012, the Clark County-Springfield Transportation Coordinating Committee announced that a roundabout would be constructed at the intersection of SR 235 and SR 41 in Pike Township, which has been the site of numerous vehicle crashes, including five fatalities from 1992 to 2013. Construction on the $1.1 million project began in June 2014 and was completed the weekend before Monday, September 15. It is the first roundabout in Clark County and is believed to be the first in Ohio with all approaches at high speed, . =State Route 69 before 1969= *1923 – Originally routed from Dayton to Forest. *1938 – Extended north to McComb along previously unnumbered road, from McComb to Hoytville along the previous alignment of State Route 186, and from Hoytville to east of Grand Rapids along a previously unnumbered road. Future The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) and the Clark County-Springfield Transportation Coordinating Committee have conducted a SR 235 Corridor Management Study, examining improvements to SR 235 in Bethel Township, between US 40 to the north, and the Greene County line to the south. The study primarily covered the Park Layne section of the township. The study area has had many vehicle crashes and four pedestrian fatalities between 2007 and 2010. The road has many closely spaced commercial driveways and lacks crosswalks, among other problems. Proposed changes included a raised median with breaks only at a few major cross streets, consolidated driveways limited to right-in/right-out access, and jughandles or U-turns at each end of the corridor for turnarounds. Other proposals included U-turns at the busiest cross street, Styer Drive, roundabouts at the major cross streets and \\"backage\\" roads. Public meetings related to this study were held in September 2011 and April 2012. The projected cost of the improvements ranged from $7.4 million to $12.2 million and construction was not expected to begin until 2017 to 2020. In mid-October 2012, it was decided by the Ohio Department of Transportation and Clark County officials to make about $3 million in improvements to this stretch of SR 235, including the consolidation of driveways and the construction of cul-de-sacs.

Random House) Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery is a 1995 non-fiction book by Norman Mailer, . It amounts to a detailed biography of Lee Harvey Oswald (1939–1963), the assassin of US President John F. Kennedy. Summary The book includes an exhaustive examination of Oswald's movements over the years, and particularly in the months, leading up to Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963, and Oswald's own death two days later. Knitted into the story of Oswald's life are Mailer's suppositions on his state of mind and motivations. The Oswald that Mailer depicts is a single- minded and vain individual convinced of his own destiny and importance who suffers a series of defeats and frustrations, and who killed the President in a desperate search for achievement. When Oswald returns to Dallas in 1963 with his wife and daughter, he still has dreams, still sees himself as \\"an instrument of history,\\" and is still frustrated and unhappy. His April 1963 assassination attempt on General Edwin Walker, a John Birch Society supporter, shows him acting out his belief that he is an instrument of history in the months leading up to November 22, 1963. Six months after the assassination attempt on Walker, Oswald takes advantage of the accident of history that has brought the JFK motorcade past the window of the Depository where he works, and he acts out his self-declared destiny. Reviews Kirkus Reviews wrote: \\"Combining the tedious and the sublime in quintessential Mailer fashion, the text reconstructs Oswald the cipher and pawn, replacing him with Oswald the ideological aspirant with an almost occult belief in his destiny. Judicious, painstaking, and imaginative, this should be a central book in a growing and undependable canon.\\" Publishers Weekly said Mailer's \\"unconvincing analysis emerges from a labyrinthine pastiche of KGB and FBI transcripts, recorded dialogues, speculations, Oswald's letters and diary excerpts, and government memos.\\" Giving the book a grade of \\"B\\", L.S. Klepp of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Mailer \\"makes Oswald a deeper, more imposing figure than he has seemed to be. It doesn’t work. Yet the book that Mailer has poised on this flawed premise is still full of interest.\\" Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times described Oswald's Tale as a \\"long-winded and ultimately superfluous book\\". According to Kakutani: \\"Mr. Mailer declines to use his enormous gifts as a reporter and novelist to create an unvarnished portrait of his subject (the way he did with Gary Gilmore in his 1979 masterpiece, The Executioner's Song), but instead clumsily tries to force his material into an unyielding cookie-cutter shape. The result is a book that succeeds simultaneously in being boring and presumptuous, derivative and solipsistic.\\" She also wrote: \\"Mr. Mailer willfully veers even further into the realm of imaginative fancy than Don DeLillo did in his powerful 1988 Oswald novel Libra.\\" Also writing for the New York Times, Thomas Powers described the work as \\"marvelous\\". Powers writes, \\"All of this is described wonderfully well. Mailer's account adds many new characters and incidents to the story told by Ms. McMillan, but it is also distinguished by a brilliant linguistic invention, a kind of Mailer-patent Russian-English that captures Russian rhythms not only of language but also of thinking and feeling about love, work and the ways of the world.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Booknotes interview with Mailer on Oswald's Tale, June 25, 1995.

They are viscous when freshly applied, have a slight fluorescence, and solidify over time with exposure to air. Description Cosmoline was developed by Houghton International in the late 1800s as a pharmaceutical product. The original Cosmoline was an ointment and was used for many different cosmetic and medical purposes. It was kept in homes to disinfect wounds and was used by veterinarians to treat cuts, abrasions, bruises and sprains. Cosmoline could even be found on farms, where it was used to relieve swelling in cow's udders. Cosmoline became an everyday name when it received a government specification as a rust preventive and began being used by the military to protect its equipment from rust and corrosion. Cosmoline could be found on military equipment in the Spanish–American War, World War I, World War II, and the Korean and Vietnam Wars.https://www.originalcosmoline.com/who-we- are.phphttps://www.houghtonintl.com/ca/find-your-products?search=cosmoline Cosmoline conforms to MIL-SPEC (MIL-C-11796C, Class 3) for Preservative and Sealing Compounds.https://www.cosmolinedirect.com/mil-spec-grease- mil-c-11796c-class-3/ Chemically, cosmoline is a homogeneous mixture of oily and waxy long-chain, non-polar hydrocarbons. It is always brown in color, but can differ in viscosity and shear strength. Cosmoline melts at 113–125 °F (45–52 °C) and has a flash point of 365 °F (185 °C). Use The most common use of Cosmoline is in the storage and preservation of some firearms, hand tools, machine tools and their tooling, and marine equipment. Entire vehicles can be preserved with cosmoline. Cosmoline is also frequently applied to automotive disc brake rotors at the factory, to prevent corrosion inside the box before the rotor is placed into service on a vehicle. It is easily removed by spraying brake cleaner on the braking surfaces of the rotor. During World War II cosmoline was used to coat weapons, including entire tanks, for long sea voyages, to prevent corrosion in salty maritime conditions. U.S. Coast Artillerymen serving the huge coastal artillery batteries were known as \\"Cosmoliners\\" as they were regularly assigned the task of \\"greasing down\\" their big guns. Cosmoline was also used during the Pacific island campaigns in World War II by the United States Marines, who sang a song about it to the tune of the popular big-band hit Tangerine: \\"Cosmoline...keeps my rifle clean\\". Many felt that it had been invented not merely to prevent rust on their weapons but for making soldiers' lives miserable. Historical fiction author W.E.B. Griffin, in his 1986 novel Semper Fi, describes in great detail the difficulties that cosmoline removal presented to a typical group of U.S. Marine Corps officer candidates in the months leading up to U.S. involvement in World War II. Due to the difficulty of completely removing cosmoline from firearms, it is being extensively replaced with vacuum-pack PET film. Aging and removal Freshly applied cosmoline, or that which is hermetically sealed in a plastic bag or shrink wrap, retains its grease-like viscosity and wipes near clean with a rag, leaving only a thin film behind. Older cosmoline which has had air exposure usually solidifies after a few years, once its volatile hydrocarbon fraction evaporates and leaves behind only the waxy remainder. This solid wax does not readily wipe off. It can be removed with laborious scraping but leaves crumbs to be swept or vacuumed away. Application of gentle heat sufficient to melt the waxy hydrocarbons allows cosmoline to drip off. Penetrating oil (such as WD-40 or CRC 5-56 CLP) sprayed and allowed to soak in until cosmoline is restored to a viscous-fluid state allows it to be wiped off. A closed-cabinet parts washer may be used to power wash smaller items. An aqueous rather than petrochemical based wash requires high heat, the proper aqueous detergent, and the correct hydraulic impact pressure.Aqueous Parts Washer Application \\"Cosmoline Removal\\" Retrieved on June 2, 2015 Soldiers in field conditions have often used gasoline or other handy petroleum-based solvent (such as kerosene) to clean cosmoline off stored weapons. It is not recommended to use harsh chemical solvents that could strip paint, finishes, or other aesthetic/functional coatings from the gun's surface. A better solvent is Stoddard Solvent, or mineral spirits. Complete instructions can be found on Cosmoline's official site.Step by Step Guide to removal of Cosmoline from firearms All cosmoline cleaning methods create hazardous waste that must be disposed of in the proper manner. Aqueous or solvent cleaning both have accepted methods to dispose of the \\"sludge\\" created. It has been reported that talcum powder can be used as an absorbent of Cosmoline by packing the powder around the item to be cleaned and applying sufficient heat to melt the solid film, allowing the compound to be wicked from the coated surface into the talcum, which can be scraped off more easily.Surplusrifle Forum \\"Mauser stock question\\" Retrieved on 08 March 2015.

Overview DG/UX 1.00, released in March, 1985, was based on UNIX System V Release 2 with additions from 4.1BSD. By 1987, DG/UX 3.10 had been released, with 4.2BSD TCP/IP networking, NFS and the X Window System included. DG/UX 4.00, in 1988, was a comprehensive re-design of the system, based on System V Release 3, and supporting symmetric multiprocessing on the Eclipse MV. The 4.00 filesystem was based on the AOS/VS II filesystem and, using the logical disk facility, could span multiple disks. DG/UX 5.4, released around 1991, replaced the legacy Unix file buffer cache with unified, demand paged virtual memory management. Later versions were based on System V Release 4. On the AViiON, DG/UX supported multiprocessor machines at a time when most variants of Unix did not. The operating system was also more complete than some other Unix variants; for example, the operating system included a full C compiler (gcc) and also a logical volume manager. The OS was small and compact, but rich in features. It was simple and easy to install and did not require vast resources of memory or processing power. For example, a six-way Pentium Pro-based AViiON would support several hundred users using text terminals. The volume manager built into the OS was simple, but very powerful. All disk administration could be performed online, without taking any file system offline. This included extending, relocating, mirroring or shrinking. The same functions could be performed on the swap area, allowing in-place migrations of disk storage without downtime. DG/UX 5.4 supported filesystem shrinking, \\"split mirror\\" online backup, filesystems up to 2 TB, and filesystem journaling in 1991. Few vendors offered similar features at that time. Later versions added support for processor and memory affinity to support their high-end multiprocessor NUMA AViiON system.

Perceval was the last surviving member of a group known as the Angry Penguins who redefined Australian art in the 1940s. Other members included John Reed, Joy Hester, Sidney Nolan, Arthur Boyd and Albert Tucker. He was also an Antipodean and contributed to the Antipodeans exhibition of 1959. Biography Perceval was born Linwood Robert Steven South at Bruce Rock, Western Australia, the second child of Robert South (a wheat farmer) and Dorothy (née Dolton). His parents separated in 1925 and he remained at his father's farm until reunited with his mother and travelling to Melbourne in 1935. Following the marriage of his mother to William de Burgh Perceval, he changed his name to John and adopted the surname de Burgh Perceval. In 1938 Perceval contracted polio and was hospitalised, giving him the opportunity to further his skills at drawing and painting. Enlisting in the army in 1941 Perceval first met and befriended Arthur Boyd. After leaving the army and moving into the Boyd family home, \\"Open Country\\",http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic- an23605138 Murrumbeena, he married Boyd's younger sister Mary in 1944. Together he and Mary Boyd produced four children. Perceval held his first solo exhibition at the Melbourne Book Club in 1948 and showed regularly with the Contemporary Art Society. Between 1949 and 1955 he concentrated on producing earthenware ceramics and helped to establish the Arthur Merric Boyd Pottery in Murrumbeena. Returning to painting in 1956 Perceval produced a series of images of Williamstown and Gaffney's Creek. Moving to England in 1963 Perceval held solo exhibitions in London, and travelled to Europe, before returning to Australia in 1965 to take up the first Australian National University Creative Fellowship. John Perceval, a major retrospective exhibition, was held at Albert Hall, Canberra in 1966. Author Margaret Plant's monograph John Perceval, was published in 1971. Suffering from alcoholism, and later in life from schizophrenia, in 1974 Perceval was committed to the psychiatric hospital Larundel, Melbourne, where he remained until 1981. John Perceval: A Retrospective Exhibition of Paintings was held at Heide Park and Art Gallery in 1984. He was awarded Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1991, the year before the National Gallery of Victoria held John Perceval: A Retrospective, where writer and art historian, Traudi Allen's John Perceval was launched. A second, entirely revised and updated edition of this publication was released in 2015. In 2000 from 19 August to 19 October John Perceval Retrospective Exhibition was held in Galeria Aniela Fine Art Gallery and Sculpture Park. It was officially opened by the Chairman of Sotheby’s (it included 80 oil paintings and works on paper from 1946 to 1999). It was Perceval's last retrospective and was mentioned on ABC TV's National News. Prior to his death Scudding Swans (1959) sold for $552,500, a record for a living Australian painter. In March 2010, it was sold for $690,000. Perceval was survived by his four children; Matthew, Tessa, Celia and Alice, all of whom are practising artists today.

The castle suffered extensive damage and was fully repaired within the next few years at a cost of £36.5 million, in a project led by the conservation architects Donald Insall Associates. It led to the Queen paying tax on her income, and to Buckingham Palace, the Queen's other official residence, being opened to the public to help pay for the restoration work. Timeline of the fireEarly stages= An 1848 drawing of the Private Chapel by Joseph Nash The fire began in the Queen's Private Chapel at 11:15 in the morning when a curtain was ignited by a spotlight pressed up against it. Agents of the Royal Household were in the chapel at the time inspecting works of art. A fire alarm went off in the watch room of the castle fire brigade, manned by the Chief Fire Officer, Marshall Smith. The location of the fire was shown by a light on a grid-map of the castle. Initially, the Brunswick Tower was lit up, but lights soon began to flash indicating that the fire had quickly spread to neighbouring rooms. A major part of the State Apartments was soon ablaze. Building contractors working in a nearby room attempted to tackle the blaze using fire extinguishers. The 30-foot (9 m) long curtains eventually dropped to the floor and continued to burn, while those present hurriedly began removing paintings from the chapel, until the intense heat and raining embers forced them to leave at 11:32. At 11:36, Mr Smith pressed a switch to alert the control room at Reading fire station. He then activated the public fire alarm in the castle and telephoned the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service on a direct line, giving the message, \\"Windsor Castle here; we have got a fire in the Private Chapel. Come to the Quadrangle as arranged\\". The castle still had its own twenty-person fire brigade, of whom six were full-time. Equipped with a Land Rover and pump tender, they were based in stables two miles south of the castle, and arrived on the scene at 11:41. Appliances from the Fire and Rescue Service arrived at 11:44. By 11:56, 17 pumping appliances had been ordered. An operation to save furniture and works of art involving castle staff, building contractors and the Queen's son, Prince Andrew, had commenced in rooms adjacent to the fire. =Subsequent events= By 12:12, there were 20 fire engines, and by 12:20 there were 35, with over 200 fire-fighters from London, Buckinghamshire, Surrey and Oxfordshire, as well as from Berkshire. The Fire Incident Commander was David Harper, Deputy Chief Fire and Rescue Officer of the Fire and Rescue Service. The Chief Officer, Garth Scotford, was out of the country, on holiday. By 12:20, the fire had spread to St George's Hall, a banqueting hall and the largest of the State Apartments. The number of fire appliances totalled 39 and 225 fire-fighters were in attendance. Hoses were directed at all levels of the building surrounding the fire. As an indication of the scale of the fire, there had been just one 30-appliance fire in the whole of Greater London since 1973. By 13:30, fire breaks had been created by tradesmen at the southern wall of the Green Drawing Room (at the end of St George's Hall on the east side of the Quadrangle), and at the north- west corner at Chester Tower, where that tower joins the Grand Corridor. The fire-fighters had by this time started to bring the fire under control, though the roof of the State Apartments had begun to collapse. At 15:30, the floors of the Brunswick Tower collapsed. Firemen had to temporarily withdraw to locate three men who were briefly lost in the smoke, and withdrew again because men were temporarily unaccounted for when part of the roof collapsed. At 16:15, the fire had revived in the Brunswick Tower. As night fell, the fire was concentrated in the tower, which by 18:30 was engulfed by flames up to high. At 19:00, the roof of St George's Hall finally collapsed. By 20:00, after burning for nine hours, the fire was under control. It continued to burn for another three hours. By 23:00, the main fire was extinguished, and by 02:30, the last secondary fires were extinguished. Pockets of fire remained until the early hours of the morning, some 15 hours after it began. Sixty firemen with eight appliances remained on duty for several more days. The fire had spread rapidly due to the large cavities and voids in the roof. 1.5 million gallons (7 million litres) of water from the mains water supply, a reservoir-fed hydrant, a swimming pool, a pond, and the nearby River Thames had been used to fight the fire. Salvage operation Apart from the several hundred firemen directly involved in the fire-fight, staff and tradesmen helped the castle's fire brigade and volunteer salvage corps move furniture and works of art from the endangered apartments, including a long table and a long carpet from the Waterloo Chamber, to the safety of the castle's riding school. It was an enormous operation: 300 clocks, a collection of miniatures, thousands of valuable books and historic manuscripts, and old Master drawings from the Royal Library were saved. On fire officers' instructions, heavy chests and tables were left behind. All other items were placed on giant sheets of tarpaulin in the North Terrace and Quadrangle, and the police called in dozens of removal vans from a large part of the home counties to transport items to other parts of the castle. Members of the Royal Household, including the Earl of Airlie, assisted in the operation. The Royal Collection Department were especially active, including the Director, Sir Geoffrey de Bellaigue, the Surveyor of Pictures, Christopher Lloyd, the Deputy Surveyor of the Queen's Works of Art, Hugh Roberts, the Curator of Print Room, Mrs Roberts, and the librarian, Oliver Everett. The Household Cavalry arrived from nearby Combermere Barracks. Some 100 officers and men of the Life Guards proved invaluable for moving bulky items. In all, 125 castle staff, 125 contractors, 100 military personnel and 20 Crown Estate staff were involved in the salvage operation. There had been no serious injuries and no deaths. Dean Lansdale, a decorator in the Private Chapel, burnt his hands while removing pictures, of which he rescued three or four. He was moved to the royal surgery and then to a hospital. A royal spokesman denied reports in the media that Christopher Lloyd, the Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, had suffered a heart attack. Five firemen were taken to hospital with minor injuries. Extent of damage to the castleStructural damage= The major loss was to the fabric of the castle. The false ceiling in St George's Hall and the void for coal trucks beneath the floor had allowed the fire to spread. It burned as far as the Chester Tower. Several ceilings collapsed. Apartments burnt included the Crimson Drawing Room (completely gutted), the Green Drawing Room (badly damaged, though only partially destroyed by smoke and water) and the Queen's Private Chapel (including the double-sided 19th century Henry Willis organ in the gallery between St George's Hall and Private Chapel, oak panelling, glass and the altar). St George's Hall survived with the walls largely intact, but the ceiling had collapsed. The State Dining Room in the Prince of Wales Tower and the Grand Reception Room were also devastated. In total, 100 rooms were affected by the fire. Smaller apartments damaged or destroyed included the Star Chamber, Octagon Room, Brunswick Tower (covered in 12 feet (3.5 m) of debris), Cornwall Tower, Prince of Wales Tower, Chester Tower, Holbein Room and the Great Kitchen, which lost its plaster coving and most of the medieval timber. The external wall above the bay window of the Crimson Drawing Room (between the Prince of Wales and Chester Towers) was seriously calcified. =Contents= A smaller copy of George III and the Prince of Wales Reviewing Troops, a large painting destroyed in the fire The most seriously damaged rooms had largely been emptied of their valuable contents the previous day, and some paintings were on loan to a travelling exhibition. Items from the Royal Collection lost include the Sir William Beechey equestrian portrait George III and the Prince of Wales Reviewing Troops, which at 13 feet (4 m) by 16 feet (5 m) was too large to remove; an 18-foot (5.5 m) long 1820s sideboard by Morel and Seddon; several items of porcelain; several chandeliers; the Willis organ; and the 1851 Great Exhibition Axminster carpet was partly burnt. Peter Brooke, then Secretary of State for National Heritage, called the fire a national disaster. =Tourism= Tourists were allowed into the precincts within three days. The Queen was back in residence a fortnight later. The Gallery and Queen Mary's Dolls' House reopened in December. The State Apartments reopened in 1993 after rewiring was completed, with all major rooms open by Easter, when only St George's Hall and the Grand Reception Room stayed closed. Thus eleven of fifteen principal rooms of the State Apartments were open, and two were still undergoing long-term restoration, with two more having been destroyed. Restoration projectFunding= It was initially feared that it would cost £60 million to restore the castle, though the final cost was £36.5 million (equivalent to £ million in ), and that drying out the castle would take 10 years. Occupied royal palaces like Windsor Castle are too valuable to insure, and items in the Royal Collection are not insured against loss. An independent trust for private donations towards the cost of the restoration was announced on 16 February 1993 by the Queen's bank, Coutts. On 29 April 1993 it was announced that 70% of the cost would be met by charging the public for entry into the castle precincts and £8 for admission to Buckingham Palace for the next five years. The Queen contributed £2 million of her own money, and she agreed to start paying income tax from 1993 onwards, making her the first British monarch to do so since the 1930s. =Planning= A diagram of the new St George's Hall's roof and woodwork On 7 June 1994, details of the restoration project were announced. The architectural firm Donald Insall Associates was appointed by the Royal Household to take overall charge of the restoration, with Sidell Gibson dealing with the reconstruction of St George's Hall and the design of the new Lantern Lobby and Private Chapel. Over half the damaged and destroyed rooms, including the State and Octagon dining rooms, were to be restored as original. There were to be new designs for the St George's Hall ceiling (with steel reinforcing beams in the roof) and East Screen, also the Queen's Private Chapel, Stuart and Holbein Rooms. However, only the Queen's Private Chapel and several modern rooms were to be restored in a modern style. Designs were submitted to a Restoration Committee, whose Chairman was the Duke of Edinburgh and Deputy Chairman was the Prince of Wales. Members included the Earl of Airlie (Lord Chamberlain), Sir Hayden Phillips (Permanent Secretary of the Department of National Heritage), Lord St John of Fawsley (Chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission), Sir Jocelyn Stevens (Chairman of English Heritage), Frank Duffy (President of the Royal Institute of British Architects) and three senior palace officials. The fire, catastrophic though it was, presented the opportunity for some major new architectural work. Although criticised by some people who thought it lacked imagination, the architects believed that, given the history of the building and the surviving fabric, the new work had to be Gothic. =Execution= The state dining room gilded sideboard, 19 feet long and made out of rare rosewood and oak, was originally designed by Augustus Pugin in the 19th century. It had to be replicated by N.E.J. Stevenson using only some photographs and descriptions. New designs for St George's Hall and the Queen's Private Chapel were approved by the Queen on 24 January 1995. Designed by architect Giles Downes, the new roof for St George's Hall is an example of a hammer-beam ceiling. The new chapel and adjoining cloisters were realigned to form a processional route from the private apartments, through an octagonal vestibule, into St George's Hall. Downes's new roof is the largest green-oak structure built since the Middle Ages and is decorated with brightly coloured shields celebrating the heraldic element of the Order of the Garter; the design attempts to create an illusion of additional height through the Gothic woodwork along the ceiling. Commentators have noted that Downes's work does much to compensate for the originally flawed dimensions of the hall. The Lantern Lobby has oak columns forming a vaulted ceiling, imitating an arum lily. The first stage of the structural restoration was completed in May 1996. Fitting out, originally planned to finish by spring 1998, occurred on 17 November 1997. The Queen held a reception in the newly restored hall for the architects and building contractors involved in the project.

It became very popular in Russia and ex- Soviet countries as well as Eastern Europe, but received criticism for positive portrayal of criminals and aestheticization of violence. The miniseries follows the story of four best friends from 1989 to 2000, and follows their rise in the world of crime from a local gang of petty thugs to a true mafia, mainly concentrating on the leader of the group, Sasha Belov, played by Sergei Bezrukov. The fifteen-part miniseries were written by Igor Porublyov and Aleksei Sidorov and were directed by Aleksei Sidorov.  Plot  The film proceeds in chronological order, apart from the scene at the beginning of the first episode before the opening credits, which was taken from Winter 1997. =Summer 1989= The film begins in 1989 when Sergeant Alexander (Sasha) Belov, (nicknamed Bely, or white) has finished his national service in the Soviet Border Troops, and returns to his home in Moscow. He is greeted there by his three childhood friends, Kosmos Kholmogorov (or Kosmos (Kos)/Space), Viktor Pchyolkin (Pchyola/Bee), and Valery Filatov (Fil/Phil). His return, however, shows that perestroika has deeply transformed the Soviet Union life and both Kosmos and Pchyola have turned to criminal racket on Moscow's markets. They try to lure Sasha to join them, but Belov abruptly refuses and instead has ambitions to attain higher education in vulcanology. Belov also learns that his former girlfriend, Yelena Yeliseyeva (Lena, Lenka) has become a prostitute. Enraged, Sasha ventures to the disco, and finds her there, but an attempted conversation is interrupted by Yelena's pimp, Mukha (Fly). Having earlier prepared for a likely fight, Belov strikes Mukha in the face with a brass knuckle resulting in fracture. Before Mukha's fellow gangsters have time to beat up Sasha, Kosmos, Fil and Pchyola arrive and rescue their friend. What Bely did not know was that Mukha has strong ties in the Militsiya — his cousin Lieutenant Vladimir Kaverin (Volodya). After Mukha's recovery, Kaverin agrees to cover the revenge against Belov, which is likely to result in death. Belov instead comes to the gang's gathering and challenges Mukha to a 1-on-1 fight, which the latter loses. The fight also ends Belov's relationship with Lenka. Unlike Pchyola and Kosmos, Fil instead is keen on pursuing a sporting career in boxing. His ambitions are lost when a doctor diagnoses him with early symptoms of Parkinson's disease and does not allow him to continue boxing, yet at the same time offers him to compete in an underground Mixed martial arts club. Fil makes his fighting début there and is supported by his three friends, but the audience includes Mukha, who decides to take his chance to avenge Belov by stabbing him, when a brawl breaks out among the supporters. The brawl is broken up by a man, who fires several shots in the air, causing the crowd to run off. The next morning Mukha's body is found in the hangar where the fight took place and Kaverin bribes the investigator to consider Belov the prime suspect. Soon, the militsiya arrive at his apartment with a search warrant and plant a pistol in his clothes. Kosmos, who accidentally passes by, is asked to witness the discovery of the pistol. When requested to sign papers as a witness, Kosmos spots Sasha on the street approaching his apartment. Kosmos leaves hastily and throws him in a car and explains what has happened. Afterwards Kosmos hides Sasha in a dacha (vacation house) outside Moscow, and his friends make separate statements to the investigator. Simultaneously, Sasha's mother tries to recruit a lawyer and also seeks help from Kosmos's father, Yuri Rostislavovich, who is a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and thus has numerous contacts among the Soviet elite. At the dacha, Sasha notices a beautiful neighbour, Olga Surikova, with whom he immediately falls in love. He follows her to her violin recital in Moscow and begins a courtship. The date ends abruptly when Olga, waiting for Sasha to return from repairing a broken heel on her shoe, notices a wanted poster on the train platform with his face and name. Sasha's friends decide to lift his spirits, and with Fil's sport contacts \\"recruit\\" a group of four female swimmers, whom they drive to the Dacha for a party that ends with couples pairing off for sex. The music volume is so high that Olga's grandmother calls the local militsiya sheriff. Having arrived too late to break up the party, he, however, discerns Belov's face, and upon returning to his station recognizes him on the wanted poster and immediately calls the OMON (armed police squad) for an arrest. They arrive just after Fil and Kosmos drive off for more alcohol, and Pchyola and Sasha barely escape the gunfire- rattled dacha into the woods, where Sasha takes a bullet. Realising that he is out of money, Kosmos arrives home and drunkenly confronts his father and Sasha's mother, promising that everything is all right with Sasha. Returning to the country, they find the sheriff taken hostage by Pchyola and Sasha and, warning him not to report the incident, drive off without killing him. In the meantime, Kosmos' father spends a whole night on the phone and finally announces that he has cleared Sasha's name. Unfortunately, it might be a year before he can return to Moscow. The 1989 story ends on top of Sparrow Hills as dawn breaks, with the four friends overlooking the panorama of Moscow. The blood-soaked Sasha swears to his friends that he will always remain loyal to them and to the Brigada. =Spring 1991= The film picks up in 1991 and the viewer learns that Sasha, after one and a half years of hiding in the Urals, decided that a criminal life would be natural after what has happened. Fil now works as a stuntman and the Brigada controls several auto-services and markets. Because, their income is insignificant and their prominence is low, Pchyola suggests to Sasha that they make their first big move by racketing the chairmen (and Pchyola's former neighbour) of the large trading company Kurs- Invest. The company owner, Artur, despite the obvious fear stricken into him by Belov's somewhat-humorous methods, abruptly refuses to accept his \\"offer\\", and leaves Belov's lawyer badly injured. In revenge, Belov hijacks Artur's large shipping of several train cars full of Aluminium from Tajikistan. After an unsuccessful attempt by Artur's own semi-criminal bodyguards to deal with Belov, the profile of the dispute catches the KGB's attention and agent Igor Vvedenskiy announces Belov's talent to his superiors and seeks permission to let the group develop further, under their control. At the same time, Artur contacts the militsiya and his case is taken up by, the now Captain, Kaverin who sees this as a perfect chance to settle the 1989 incident with Belov. In the meantime, Sasha marries Olga and, after a lavish reception, their first wedding night is to follow in their new apartment in the Kotelnicheskaya Embankment building (a wedding gift by Pchyola, Fil and Kosmos). However, this almost ends in disaster when the hem of Olga's wedding gown gets tangled in a wire attached to the pin of a hand grenade, neatly set up right across the front door of their apartment. Sasha manages to grab the armed grenade and throw it into the stairwell after a neighbour's dog rushed to rip the wire and release the pin. Afterwards, in Kosmos's father's apartment, Olga confesses to Sasha despite her knowing who he is and what he does, she still loves him. Knowing that such action could have been carried out only by a mole, Sasha stages his imminent departure to Yalta, which causes the mole to reveal himself. Afterwards he is driven out into the woods and killed. Belov openly states to his Brigada that anyone who tries something like that will share his fate. Kaverin shows Artur the picture of the dead mole, and much to irritation of Artur for the failed attempt to remove Belov, Kaverin tries to convince him that this is a perfect evidence to legally crush the Brigada. Artur refuses, but at that instant the Brigada burst into the office. Artur and Kaverin just manage to hide in the toilet, and Kosmos and Bee nearly assault Artur's secretary Lyuda. After they leave, Kaverin takes drunk Artur's signature to write a statement by himself. Yet at this point Vvedensky's KGB move in, and Kaverin is promptly discharged from service. Simultaneously the original Aluminium producer from Tajikistan calls for the Tajik mafia to move in against Belov for hijacking their deal, as Artur paid only half the fee. In an imminent gang duel Bely recognises the leader as his old army friend Farkhad Dzhurayev (Farik). The two instead choose to turn to Drug trade, where Belov's Aluminium trains would be used to smuggle heroin from Tajikistan. To celebrate the deal, both Belov's Brigada and Farik's godfathers go to a lavish restaurant, where they witness Olga performing. Vvedensky makes contact with Belov and under threat of prison announces that narcotics are to be only transited via Russia. In return for Belov's agreement, Artur is forced to give up his position and emigrate, and Belov fully takes over Kurs-Invest including its office and even Artur's secretary, Lyuda. Olga, after graduation from the Philharmonia fails to begin her music career, and instead turns to her former course-mate Vitalik, and joins his band. Vitalik, not hiding his attraction to Olga, tries to blackmail her into leaving her husband, who openly disapproves of both Vilalik and her being part of the band, which he further makes visible by having the whole party leave the restaurant. Eventually Sasha witnesses how Vitalik verbally offends Olga and makes him suffer in a short fight, after which Olga happily walks off with Sasha. The 1991 part of the film finishes when Olga and Sasha pause their love-making when they become aware that the television is broadcasting the same Swan Lake on all channels, which a Russian viewer will know is the beginning of the 1991 August Coup which brought the end of the Soviet Union. =Autumn 1993= The 1993 story picks with Sasha returning from the United States, just as Olga is about to give birth to their son, Ivan. He arrives during the Constitutional coup. Simultaneously, Farik also arrives in Moscow, who is sent by his family elders to negotiate a deal to sell narcotics in Moscow, rather than following Belov's less profitable suggestion of transporting them to the West. As the two parties reach Sasha's office, the Russian OMON raid the premises, and all the Brigada are arrested and taken to the Butyrka isolator. The large cell is filled with people swept up in raids, including Kaverin and two colleagues. Although the two parties do not approach each other, they describe what they know of their friends, and that Kaverin, after leaving the MVD, now works for a private security firm with criminal activities, headed by Bek. Vvedenskiy, realising what has become of Belov, arranges for his release. As soon as Sasha walks out he learns that Olga has given birth. As the Brigada drive off to the hospital they see army trucks removing the dead from the White House. Seeing his newborn son, the Brigada come back to the office, where Farik tells the problems he has to Beliy. Kosmos and Pchyola agree that selling drugs in Moscow would bring more revenue, but Sasha refuses. The discussion ends, and Farik walks out saying that he felt betrayed. Kosmos convinces Beliy to change his mind, but stating that he will not play any direct role in the deal. What they do not know, is that the whole conversation is recorded by Kaverin via remote surveillance equipment. Immediately Kaverin forwards the tapes to Bek, who agrees to hijack the deal. Sasha fearing that the clients might trap Farik, offers Fil to come along to oversee the exchange. Farik, however, refuses, and Sasha's worst fear comes true. The deal is carried out with Farik handing over the narcotics on the Ferris Wheel of the VDNKh and his two Tajik friends receiving the money outside Moscow. After the exchange, both Tajik parties are murdered. Sasha learns what has happened and personally takes the bodies to Farik's elders in Tajikistan. Belov explains, to his father that they have every right to consider him responsible, but he is here alone, and that their partnership is more important. After showing Farik's father the photo of the newborn Ivan, the former allows him to return to Moscow and find those responsible. Kaverin, now sceptical of Bek approaches the Brigada. After playing them the tapes, he convinces them that he was gathering intelligence for Bek, and knew he would hijack the exchange. The action on New Year's Eve alternates between Sasha and Olga at a performance of Tchaikovsky's Waltz from Swan Lake and various locations in Moscow where Bek himself and his group are killed in retaliation for Farik's death. Belov, bored at the concert, receives news of the successful operation amid the final applause. This causes him stand up with the audience and applaud a Bravo. The 1993 part of the film ends with Vvedenskiy reporting to the KGB on Kaverin. Seeing how the subject has successfully played out a double agent between Bek and Belov and that his personal score with the latter, Vvedenskiy proposes to support Kaverin as a counterbalance Belov's growing brigade. =Autumn 1994= As Belov's group gains more and more prominence, bigger games become played. Their contacts go beyond narcotics, and Kaverin sets Kosmos up with Luka, a renowned Thief in law. Luka offers to use Belov's drug channels to transfer arms to Chechnya for Kosmos. Belov, however, is not interested in the Arms Trade, and instead wants to legalise his activities, for which he befriends a Russian politician, Viktor Petrovich and passes on a set of papers for a \\"restoration fund\\" which grants him tax-free trade of alcohol and tobacco. However, the KGB (now FSK) want the arms deal to progress, and have Luka's men attack Sasha when he is visiting with Olga and Ivan to his mother's flat. Belov's bodyguard Max is able to kill two and pursues the remaining assassin away. Max hurries Olga and Ivan to a safe-house outside Moscow, while Belov and Fil hide in an undisclosed flat in Moscow. The shoot-out gains wide coverage on television, which Vvedenskiy watches from home. He instructs Kaverin to bring Kosmos to Luka, who tells Kosmos that in case of Belov's refusal, Luka will remove Belov altogether and Kosmos will take over. Despite this offer, Kosmos breaks the situation to Belov. Olga discovers that Ivan has a throat infection that needs an urgent operation. Driving to a local hospital, their escort gets caught at a GAI checkpoint and is apprehended. During Ivan's operation, Luka's men surround the small provincial hospital, with only Max to defend it. While Fil unsuccessfully tries to gain aid from Viktor Petrovich, Luka phones Belov and states his ultimatum. Belov throws the phone down, and Luka tells Kaverin to finish him off. Kaverin hires a professional sniper and a gang duel is called on the Tushino airfield with the sniper on top of a building several kilometres away. However, Luka is killed instead of Sasha, and Pchyola and Fil finish off his bodyguards. Luka's men leave the hospital and Ivan's operation is completed. Afterwards, Beliy meets with Vvedensky and Kaverin. Vvedenskiy tells him that Kaverin is taking over Luka's activities and Beliy must sell weapons to Chechnya if he does not want a repeat of what has happened. The 1994 story ends when Belov visits his mother's flat. Witnessing the earlier assassination attempt, she collapsed with a heart attack, and died. Belov talks to her spirit, asking her to forgive him. =Spring 1995= The First Chechen War has broken out, and there are daily radio reports of Russian casualties from guerilla attacks. Kosmos feels very personal about this, as it was initially his idea, but now the weapons they are selling are being used against the Russians. Pchyola takes over the financial side of the distribution. This causes an open conflict between them, causing Sasha to intervene. Having already been an addict of cocaine, Kosmos overdoses, and is injured in a car accident. Sasha visits him at his father's house, and Kosmos confesses that back in 1989, upon seeing Mukha creep up behind Bely with a knife, it was he who shot him. Sasha forgives him and decides to end the Chechen problem. Belov continues his attempts in legalising the Brigada's activities and secures a deal with Viktor Petrovich for a set of alcohol and tobacco licenses. Breaking the news to Fil, they go to a casino to celebrate, where Sasha becomes very drunk, and they bump into famous film producer Gordon and his wife, actress Anyuta, whom Fil knows from his work as a stuntman. Kaverin finalises a new shipment of arms to Chechnya and after agreeing on the route, goes to the same casino, where he crosses paths with Belov. They begin to argue on their mutual dislike of each other, and Kaverin confesses it was his influence that the search of his house in 1989 included a false extraction of a pistol. Bely breaks a bottle of champagne on Volodya's head. Upon leaving the casino, Bely sees Anyuta's look and comes back to her place beginning an affair. The next morning he discovers that Gordon is homosexual and their marriage is merely a convenience. Kaverin heads off to Chechnya, and meets the insurgent militants. The delivery of arms is intercepted by Army spetsnaz commandos, who kill the militants and destroy the trucks. Back in Moscow the frantic Pchyola, waiting for the call to confirm the deal, is told that everything is destroyed. Sasha reaffirms him that despite the US$11 million they lost, it will be good for them nonetheless. Viktor Petrovich thanks Sasha for the information he has given him and reassures him that he has nothing to fear from the Vvedensky's side. Belov meets Vvedensky in front of his own home, and realizing that Vvedensky is shocked that Belov knows where he lives, Sasha tells him that they both have children and that all he wants is for them to co-exist. Vvedensky acknowledges that even he can be manipulated by Bely, and agrees with him that stopping the arms flow was the right thing to do. The 1995 part of the film ends with a blood soaked Kaverin, who despite taking two sniper bullets, is limping next a burnt out village. A Russian Army BTR patrol pulls up and the soldiers rescue him. =Winter 1997= After the previous events, the Brigada begins to cool down. Fil has a very successful part as a stuntman in a new production by Gordon about Highlander. Sasha maintains the affair with Gordon's wife, Anyuta, who has the main role in the film. After a particularly good stunt Fila borrows a camcorder from Anyuta to show Ivan, who returns with Olga from America. He also takes head of mannequin with him. Fil drives Olga and Ivan home and then catches the rest of the Brigada in a night club. There Pchyola negotiates a new money laundering deal with the Caucasus mafia. Bely refuses to accept it, out of principle's of continuing the legal profile of the business. Pchyola, much to the dismay of Kosmos, decides to follow it through alone and travels to airport not with Brigada but with Caucasians. Pchyola departs for the airport to catch his flight to Germany. As Fil drives Kosmos and Sasha back to their office, all three notice how their wristwatch arms accelerate and the radio begins to glitch. In a split second decision Sasha yells for everyone to jump out, and with Kosmos they roll out onto the snow-covered street. Fil however hesitates, and jumps only seconds before the large Mercedes explodes. This is the scene that was shown before the opening credits of the first episode. Unconscious, he is rushed off to the hospital where he spends several hours under surgery with serious head injuries. Kosmos convinces Sasha that Pchyola is the only one who could have carried this out, as after their death he'll have everything and he didn't sit into their car. They send their head of security, Shmit, and his men (all former thugs) to find him. Pchyola himself, as soon as he learns of the attack, just as he arrives to the airport, catches the first taxi back to Moscow. Night falls, and Fil is still under surgery, Olga meanwhile is learning to drive with Maks (now her and Ivan's personal bodyguard), on the Kutuzovsky Prospekt, where Pchyola catches up with her. He tells her on the phone not to tell Max about him and asks her to stop at the pharmacy and come in alone. There he tells her that the camcorder which Fil borrowed remained turned on, and that right now it is at Anyuta's house (Fil returned it to her after realizing that it was Gordon's camera). Max upon seeing Pchyola immediately calls Shmit, who arrives and brings him to the hospital. Olga meanwhile comes to Anyuta's home and confronts her, forcing to abandon the affair with Sasha, and to return the camera. At the hospital Pchyola is met with Bely and Kosmos holding pistols, they are interrupted by a nurse asking for anyone with Type B negative blood for Fil. Sasha points to Pchyola who makes a transfusion to the still unconscious Fila, after the operation was finally completed. Kosmos then tells Bely that he will not have the courage to kill Pchyola, to which Sasha replies that neither will he. Kos advises Sasha to have Shmit do it. To calm his nerves, Sasha asks Kosmos for cocaine, stating that, he spent many years selling it but never tried it, though after a second attempt he feels nothing. At this moment Olga and Maks burst in with the camcorder. Sasha shouts at Olga, but Maks intervenes and plays the tape, which shows how Gordon plants the bomb inside the head of mannequin that Fil brought with him. Kosmos remembers that Gordon was borrowed half a million from Fil, but lacked the means to pay it off. Realizing what has happened, Kosmos pleads to Pchyola for his mistake. The 1997 part of the film ends when Olga walks in on the drunken Kosmos, Sasha and Pchyola and tells then that Fil is in a coma. =Winter 1998= A year has passed and Fil is still in a coma. The doctors try to persuade his wife, Tamara to turn off his feeding tube, as there is little chance of recovery. Learning of this, Belov, though agreeing to transferring him to a private clinic, decides to avenge his friend. Gordon makes a successful and popular premiere of his new picture, and to celebrate he meets his homosexual date where they drive off to a gay club. Before they leave the car, the young lad passes his regards from Sasha Bely and strangles Gordon to death. The murder of a famous film producer generates a massive media outrage about the mafia, and Olga takes Ivan and leaves Sasha. Belov comes to the same dacha where her grandmother still lives and almost forcefully assaults Olga. The militsiya arrive, where Sasha recognises the same militsiya sheriff from 1989. He turns himself in and back at the station they drink and dance, telling their life stories. The militsiya officer then demonstrates the old wanted poster of Belov, and sets out making him some photocopies. As he awaits, Belov's eyes grow in shock when he sees an election poster with Kaverin's face. Kaverin has survived Chechnya, and is running for the State Duma in the upcoming majoritarian election. Shmit, Pchyola and Kosmos pay Gordon's assassin, but after he leaves the cafe, a SOBR unit arrests them, drives into the woods, where the three are forced to dig a grave for themselves under gunpoint. The SOBR gunmen open fire at the empty trees right above their heads, and walk off, leaving the three to find a way out. When the three dirty men arrive back at the office, Belov enquires into the event. Viktor Petrovich tells him that it was carried out by a militsiya commander, who after Gordon's death sends a warning that there were still law and order who could crush Bely and his Brigada should this happen again. Bely confronts the Commander, telling he did what was necessary for his friend. He gets a phone call from the hospital that there has been further complications with Fil. Before leaving the Commander, he takes a Russian Orthodox cross that the SOBR took from his friends. The 1998 part ends when Sasha visits Fil and finds him surrounded by doctors. He kneels over Fil, and seeing that his eyes are open whispers: \\"brother\\". A tear flows out of Fil's eyes. After that Belov makes up his mind to run against Kaverin. =Winter 1999= Its December 1999, and the elections are scheduled for early spring 2000, and Kaverin and Belov try to outdo each other. Vvedensky decides to act once again, and pushes the two to closer confrontation. Kaverin plays on discrediting his opponent, and to smear Belov's image, a provocative poster \\"Brotherhood is fighting to the Power\\" with Belov holding a pistol is issued, and then the typography which printed them is set on fire. One day Belov and his family arrive home to their television set that is playing police surveillance reels from the early 1990s showing how the Brigada are involved in racket, after which Kaverin rings to Belov. A bug is found in Belov's office, but most of all, at a press conference Kaverin demonstrates Artur to the public, who tells of how Belov's criminal gang forced him out of Russia and took over his business in 1991. Kaverin's public biography is based on a real officer who died in Chechnya and was given him by Vvedensky. Vvedensky warns Volodya that if the public finds out what he did there, this would be used against him. Bely's campaign focuses more on the social problems. He has his men deliver presents to the poor, and sponsors construction of Orthodox Churches to win support. He tries to re- unite with Olga, and after a dinner together, breaks with her into the same dacha where he hid in 1989. There he tells her of his thoughts, before the discussion turns to love-making. As the elections near, the two candidates engage in a television debate, both ask piercing questions into their cloudy past. Kaverin decides to play a trump card, a cassette with more early 1990s recordings. However instead a scene from The Godfather is played, much to the amusement of the viewers. Belov then takes the initiative and states that the reel that was to be played was one of thousands there could be and admits to his past. He then states that this mess, in which he was forced to take the actions he did, was caused at the very top in the government and he was just a pawn that was swept into the new world. Furthermore, he appeals that what is important is that, at present, everybody wants to live in a better country, where the necessary actions of the past would remain there. Soon the elections come, and despite Kaverin's early lead, Belov clips a narrow margin at the last moment and wins the vote. A celebration follows at Belov's office, Kosmos proposes to Lyuda, Artur's original secretary who has worked with them since 1991. Then a phone call follows that Sasha and Olga are on their way. Pchyola and Kosmos come out into the snow-covered courtyard to greet them, and see Sasha's red armoured SUV driven alone by Maks, who climbs out and stabs the two. Bely who arrives later, is shocked at what happened. At dawn Belov also learns that Fil, who was still recovering in the hospital and his wife Tamara were also killed in the clinic. On the wall a sign \\"GORGE IT BEAST\\" (in Russian \\"ЖРИ ТВАРЬ\\") is written with blood. Maks is nowhere to be found. Meeting up with Vvedensky Sasha learns that Maksim Karelskiy, despite working for eight years for Belov, and several times rescuing both him, his family and Pchyola from Bely himself, was nonetheless a mole for Kaverin since 1991. Originally he crossed paths with the Chechen mafia and Kaverin paid his ransom, after which he used him to infiltrate the Brigada. Vvedensky along with Viktor Petrovich, the whole underground criminal world, and even Yuri Rostislavovich (Kosmos's father), all ask that Belov should not seek revenge. Sasha says that he can't accept that, and first rattles Kaverin's apartment with an PKM as a message he will avenge. In the final stunt, he contacts his old friend who the viewer saw throughout the film, karate trainer and stuntman Alexander Inshakov. Originally they meet up back in 1989 when Sasha bought a mastiff, then again in 1991 they offered him to train his men, and he refused, Inshakov was Fil's close friend during their stunt work for Gordon, and shortly before Gordon's death asked him to have all of the film reels to make a tribute to stuntman Filatov. Sasha then visits the morgue where already the four coffins are prepared for the funeral, and symbolically adds three pistols into the hands of his friends. The next day, Kosmos's original Lincoln Town Car is shown to Sasha. Bely sends Shmit to the cemetery and says he follow onwards and introduces his new head of security and saying he explain everything to him later. When Shmit arrives, the funeral service is about to begin. As Belov, Olga and Ivan drive onto a causeway, the car is hit by an M72 LAW and falls into the river. The funeral mass is announced that Belov is killed. =Winter/Spring 2000= Although announced in the opening credits, this part of the film was never announced. Belov's death allowed Maks and Kaverin to come out of hiding. Seeing a final end to his lifelong rival, he and Artur engage in a joint business venture, and are examining a construction site that is soon to open as a new shopping centre. Out of nowhere Bely appears and kills Maks, Artur, a few of their fellow thugs and finally Kaverin himself. Afterwards he explains to Inshakov how he staged his own death and how the car was empty when it exploded and went over into the river. The film ends in spring when snow melted, Sasha once again visits Sparrow Hills, this time alone, and remembers how nine years ago he swore to always stand for his brothers. Repeating the words his same words, he adds that he swears he will never forget those who he called brothers, and with that cracks his watch on the railing. At the airport, Olga and Ivan, await Sasha to board the plane and leave Russia. While the final boarding is called, Olga gets a call from Sasha, who says he will not be joining them right now, because it's too dangerous for them, but will come in a couple of months. The tearful Olga walks into the airplane with Ivan. Sasha, standing on a causeway, watches the airplane depart. As he catches a taxi, the screen turns black and the final credits begin to roll. Music Reflective of Russians' affinity to music,- classical music and musical instruments are well represented in the series. Upright pianos are in the homes of Sasha's mother and Kosmos' father. Olga is a violinist and her rehearsing on a violin impresses Sasha to court her. Olga and Sasha attend a Bolshoi Theater performance of Swan Lake Waltz. This is a non-exhaustive list of music identified in the series: * Tchaikowski Swan Lake Waltz in Bolshoi Theater performance * Morning Mood by Peer Gynt (Grieg) during film review awards * Rock Solid Blues return in a vegetable truck after a near death experience * The Power (Snap! song) in a Doll's Bar accompaniment to exotic dancing * Anitra's Dance by Peer Gynt (Grieg) where Sasha snorting his first cocaine with Kosmos * Meant To Be by Squirrel Nut Zippers, performed by Olga and her band  Critics  The main complaints about the film are that it romanticizes banditry and relations between members of the criminal community in general, showing too attractive (especially for the youth audience) images of criminals.«Идиот» дороже «Каменской», но дешевле «Бригады» // Novaya Gazeta A striking example of this is the fate that befell Leonid Sidorov — the son of the Director of the series, who from the age of 8 was kept in a boarding school, because his parents were deprived of the rights to his education. As a difficult teenager, at the peak of the popularity of the \\"Brigade\\" in the mid-2000s, he put together a gang around him, whose members appearance and relationships with each other imitated the main characters of the series; for himself, Leonid chose the image of \\"Space\\". Initially engaged in petty extortion from peers, the criminal group reached serious crimes. In 2006, Leonid was convicted of car theft, and in 2008 that was followed by a second conviction — 13 years in prison for robbery, double murder and rape. However, throughout the film, his wife and friends constantly decry \\"Sasha White\\" because he chose a criminal path. The end of the film is far from optimistic: three of the four friends are killed, and Alexander Belov \\"goes underground\\", regretting the chosen path, because of which he lost everything. Pavel Maykov, the performer of the role of the Bee, in 2018 called the \\"Brigade\\" a crime against Russia, in which he participated, and explained that the harm of the series is that because of him, \\"the boys wanted to become bandits\\".  Cast  Although the actors were not fresh, for nearly all of them, it was this film that made their careers. * Sergei Bezrukov as Alexandr Belov (Belyy/White) – The leader of the Brigada. He is smart and very business oriented but has numerous vices, such as infidelity. He cares deeply for his three friends and when one of them is considered to be a traitor, he refuses to believe it. * Vladimir Vdovichenkov as Valeriy Filatov (Fil/Phil) – After Sasha he seems to be the most level-headed member of the group. He is a boxer early on and then becomes a stunt man. After a failed assassination attempt, he goes into a long coma for a year. * Dmitri Dyuzhev as Kosmos Kholmogorov (Kosmos/Space) – The comic relief of the group. He's also the flashiest one. Later in the series Sasha finds it hard to trust Kosmos but ultimately they remain good friends. He develops a serious cocaine problem. * Pavel Maykov as Viktor Pchyolkin (Pchyola/Bee) - The quiet soft-spoken member of the group. He is successful with women yet very confused sometimes. After what seemed like a treacherous act on his part, Sasha forgave him and ultimately discovered who the real perpetrator was. * Yekaterina Guseva as Olga Belova (née Surikova) – Sasha's wife and only love. Throughout the decade they have their share of domestic squabbles, some more serious than others, but by the end they solidify their love. She is a violinist and was raised by her grandmother. * Andrei Panin as the policeman Vladimir Kaverin – He is the perpetual villain throughout the series. He sort of comes and goes. In the beginning he is a corrupt cop who fails to nail Sasha. This drives him nearly mad and he decides to join up with Sasha's gang later on to wreak vengeance. He never got the chance as he was nearly killed in Chechnya and forced to stay with the military and lie low. He is a very slimy and snake-like character whose only drive is to kill Sasha Belov. = Minor roles = *Sergei Aprelsky — Mukha / Fly (ep. 1–2, 10) *Mariya Aronova — Katya (ep. 5, 7-9, 15) *Vitali Bezrukov — The dog lover (ep. 2) *Aleksandr Belyavskiy — Viktor Petrovich (ep. 8-13, 11, 15) *Aleksandra Budanova — Anyuta (ep. 8-11) *Aleksandr Vysokovsky — Max (ep. 6, 8-9, 11-15) *Sergei Garmash — SOBR general (ep. 12) *Vyacheslav Grishechkin — A guy in Ryzhsky market (ep. 2-3) *Dmitri Gumenetsky — Shmidt (ep. 7-15) *Nikolai Yeremenko Jr. — Yuri Rostislavovich (Kosmos's father) (ep. 3-5, 10, 15) *Mikhail Zhigalov — Thief in law Luka (ep. 8-9) *stuntman Alexander Inshakov — himself (ep. 2-3, 6, 11-12, 15) *Denis Kiris — District militsiya officer (ep. 2, 5) *Aleksei Kravchenko — Vvedenskiy (ep. 4-9, 11, 13-14) *Leonid Kuravlyov — MVD general (ep. 5-6) *Farhad Mahmudov — Farhad Juraev (ep. 1, 6-8) *Pyotr Merkuryev — Professor (ep. 4) *Alla Mescheryakova — Pchyolkin's mother (ep. 11, 15) *Alexandra Nazarova — Olga's Granny (ep. 2-5, 7-8, 10, 13-15) *Viktor Pavlov — Pchyolkin's father (ep. 5, 11) *Natalya Panova — Lena, Belov's (ex-)girlfriend (ep. 1) *Darya Poverennova — Kosmos's stepmother (ep. 2-3) *Mariya Poroshina — Tamara, Filatov's wife (ep. 5, 8, 11-15) *Daniil Strakhov — Vitalik (ep. 6) *Valentina Telichkina — Belov's mother (ep. 1-3, 7-10) *Yan Tsapnik — Artur Lapshin, the businessman (ep. 4-6, 14-15) *Svetlana Chuikina — Lyuda, Artur's secretary (ep. 4-5, 8, 14-15) *Yana Shivkova — Vvedenskiy's wife (ep. 5, 7) * Yuriy Dumchev — Brity  Sequel  The author of the original book wrote a series of sequel novels which had Sasha start a new gang but it was met with lackluster reviews by critics, who said there was no chemistry between Sasha and the new gang like there was between him, Pchela, Kosmos, and Fil. However, the book is still considered an interesting read for whomever enjoyed the first part.

Stoops served as the head football coach at the University of Arizona from 2003 until his firing during the 2011 season. He previously served as an assistant football coach at the University of Iowa, Kansas State University, and University of Oklahoma. He is the younger brother of Bob Stoops, the former head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners football program, and the older brother of Mark Stoops, head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats football program. He returned to Oklahoma as the defensive coordinator in 2012. He served in the position until he was fired on October 7, 2018.

He attended Cardinal Mooney High School in Youngstown, Ohio, where his father was an assistant football coach and defensive coordinator. After high school Stoops attended the University of Iowa and played for the Hawkeyes (1982–1984) as a strong safety. He played on the same team with quarterback Chuck Long and was a two-time all-Big Ten Conference selection. Stoops was signed as a free agent in May 1985 by the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL),\\"OCU Move Ending Women's Loop\\". – Associated Press – (c/o Daily Oklahoman). – May 15, 1985. but was cut on August 27.Pierson, Don. – \\"Buford Ousts Finzer as Bears Cut 10\\". – Chicago Tribune. – August 28, 1985.

In the summer of 1987, Stoops became one of the original 80 Arena Football League (AFL) players when he suited up for the Pittsburgh Gladiators. Stoops was a key member of the Gladiators that season who went on to play in the inaugural ArenaBowl, losing to Denver, 45–16. He was named Second Team All-Arena in 1987. Stoops took time off from his job as a graduate assistant at Iowa to play as a replacement player for a limited time in 1987 with the Chicago Bears during the NFL strike.Bierig, Joel. – \\"Dreams of glory are long since gone – Spare Bears really cared\\". – Chicago Sun-Times. – November 23, 1987.\\"Meet the Scab Bears\\". – Chicago Sun-Times. – September 24, 1987.

Other former Iowa players who were members of the National Football League Players Association had harsh words for Stoops. He responded, \\"I don't give a damn what they think. I wasn't trying to hurt anybody, and deep down, I think they know that. But if they feel that way, fine, don't ever talk to me again\\". Returning to the Arena Football League, in the six-game AFL regular season, Stoops caught 22 passes, scored three touchdowns, made 15 tackles and recorded an interception, playing both wide receiver and defensive back positions. Coaching careerEarly coaching= Stoops held assistant coaching positions at the University of Iowa, Kansas State University and the University of Oklahoma. With his hiring by Arizona in November 2003, Stoops became the school's youngest coach at hiring at age 41, since Larry Smith.Arizona hires Oklahoma's Mike Stoops USA Today, November 29, 2003 Upon taking over, he hired his brother, University of Miami defensive backs coach Mark Stoops, as defensive coordinator. Stoops then followed and hired Texas Tech co-offensive coordinator Sonny Dykes after the 2006 season. Dykes, named as winner of the All-American Football Foundation's Mike Campbell Top Assistant Award and later head coach at Louisiana Tech, California and SMU, has been cited as one of the country's brightest offensive minds and top ten college recruiters by Rivals.com. =Arizona= After going 6–6 in 2006, the Wildcats lost three of their first four games in 2007, including a 29–27 loss at home to New Mexico. In that game, Stoops gained a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for his behavior on the sideline, which led to a New Mexico touchdown. Following a 2007, 21–20 home loss to Stanford, dropping the team to 2–6, local media began speculating as to whether Stoops would be fired. As year careens downhill, expect some heads to roll by Greg Hansen, Arizona Daily Star, October 21, 2007 Dark days for Wildcats football by Anthony Gimino, The Arizona Republic, October 23, 2007 However, subsequent statements by the athletic director and the university's president indicated that Stoops would return for an additional season. At the beginning of the season, many believed this to be the year Stoops and the Wildcats would reach their first college bowl game in a decade; a winning season was considered a must in order for Stoops to remain as Wildcats head coach. \\"Gimino: No wiggle room for Stoops\\", Anthony Gimino, Tucson Citizen, July 24, 2008 Under the direction of Stoops, Arizona scored 70 points in the season opener against the Idaho Vandals, falling just four points short of a school record for points scored in a game. They went on to soundly defeat Toledo, UCLA, Washington, and California, but lost close games to New Mexico and Stanford. They went on to defeat Washington State on the road to secure bowl eligibility at six wins, but lost to Oregon on the road after mounting a dramatic second-half come-from-behind rally, and to Oregon State in Tucson on a last-second field goal. The Wildcats' final game of the regular season was a 31–10 victory on December 6 in Tucson against Arizona State in the annual Territorial Cup rivalry game. With that win and a final regular season record of 7–5, Arizona accepted a bid from to the Las Vegas Bowl to face BYU. It was the Wildcats' first bowl appearance since the 1998 Holiday Bowl. Stoops' reputation in Tucson was mixed; while the Wildcats had a winning record and appeared in and won their first bowl game in ten years, many fans were divided during the season on whether he should be retained as head coach, as they expected Stoops to guide the team to an eight, nine or even ten-win season given the talent level and the offensive and defensive systems employed by the Wildcats (and with the overall talent level in the Pac-10 conference perceived to be not as strong as usual in 2008). While Stoops brought the Wildcat football program to a level of respectability which was lost during the era of John Mackovic, some fans were disappointed the program was not at the elite level of Stoops' former program Oklahoma or of perennial Pac-10 football power USC. \\"Critics not bowled over by UA\\"; John Moredich, Tucson Citizen, Nov. 28, 2008 However, Stoops was given strong votes of confidence by UA (later UNLV) athletic director Jim Livengood, by university president Dr. Robert Shelton, and by several prominent Arizona football boosters.\\"UA football boosters still believe in Stoops\\", John Moredich, Tucson Citizen, December 4, 2008 On December 18, Stoops was rumored to be a candidate for the Iowa State head coaching job, which eventually went to Auburn assistant Paul Rhoads.[62andeven.com] On December 20, Arizona defeated BYU in the Las Vegas Bowl. On December 23, Stoops was given a contract extension through the 2013 season by Livengood. \\"We're very pleased with the progress of Arizona football under Mike's direction,\\" Livengood said. \\"His personal growth as a coach has been outstanding and we’re glad to continue moving forward with him as the steward for Arizona football.\\" Stoops said on the news of his extension, \\"I'm very excited about the extension...The administration always has shown a commitment to what we’re doing, and this bolsters that support...We’re working hard to build stability and the commitment from Jim and the university at this time will go a long way to solidify that effort. I’m happy to be here in Tucson for a long time as head coach of our Wildcats. This is where my family wants to be.\\"\\"UA's Stoops to extend through 2013\\", azcentral.com, December 23, 2008 The Wildcats compiled an 8–4 (6–3) record in the 2009 regular season, which earned them a share of second place in the Pac-10 and a bid to the Holiday Bowl. Stoops was named a semifinalist for the George Munger Award,\\"Stoops a Semifinalist for National Coach of Year \\", Arizona Athletics, November 4, 2009 but was not named a finalist. The Wildcats compiled a 7–5 (4–5) record in the 2010 regular season, which earned them a seventh-place finish in the Pac-10 and a bid to the Alamo Bowl. This bid was due, in part, to only four Pac-10 teams being bowl eligible after USC was sanctioned from bowl eligibility, and Arizona State was denied a bowl waiver from the NCAA, which it needed because two of ASU's wins came against FCS teams. Both USC and Arizona State finished higher than Arizona in the Pac-10 standings. Oregon and Stanford were selected for BCS bowls, and the Rose Bowl selected an at large team, TCU, to pair with the Big Ten champion, Wisconsin, leaving the second highest Pac-10 affiliated bowl game, the Alamo Bowl, to choose between Arizona and Washington. The Wildcats started the 2011 season losing five of their six games, and their first four games in the newly expanded Pac-12 Conference. After a loss on the road to previously-winless Oregon State, Stoops was relieved of his duties on October 10, 2011 with the announcement made by athletic director Greg Byrne. Co-defensive coordinator Tim Kish was named as interim head coach. Stoops received a $1.4 million buyout from Arizona.Mike Stoops is out: Why and what's next? =Return to Oklahoma= On January 11, 2012, Stoops returned to OU as co-defensive coordinator. He was to be teamed with Brent Venables, who shortly left to become the defensive coordinator at Clemson. Kish was soon after named as Oklahoma's linebackers coach. When his brother retired at the end of the 2016 season, Stoops was retained by his successor, Lincoln Riley. In October 2018, Stoops was fired from his position as defensive coordinator shortly after losing to Texas (48–45). =Alabama= Nick Saban hired Stoops to be on his coaching staff as an analyst for the 2019 season. After the season, Mark Stoops, his brother, offered him a position on his coaching staff at Kentucky, but he declined and decided to stay at Alabama as an analyst.https://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/03/02/mike- stoops-alabama-kentucky/ Head coaching recordReferencesExternal links * Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:American football defensive backs Category:Alabama Crimson Tide football coaches Category:Arizona Wildcats football coaches Category:Chicago Bears players Category:Iowa Hawkeyes football coaches Category:Iowa Hawkeyes football players Category:Kansas State Wildcats football coaches Category:National Football League replacement players Category:Oklahoma Sooners football coaches Category:Pittsburgh Gladiators players Category:Sportspeople from Youngstown, Ohio Category:Players of American football from Ohio Category:Educators from Ohio ","title":"Mike Stoops"},{"id":"2496183","text":"Financial mismanagement is management that, deliberately or not, is handled in a way that can be characterized as \\"wrong, bad, careless, inefficient or incompetent\\" and that will reflect negatively upon the financial standing of a business or individual. There are many ways of how financial mismanagement is carried out. For example, the wrong distribution of responsibility, to be remiss with payments, bills and taxes and neglecting responsibility, financial problems and economical standing can cause great financial mismanagement and further on devastate your economy. By looking to various cases where the financial management has gone wrong we will be able to comprehend the effect financial mismanagement can have and how crucial it is for an economy's success to carry out well working financial management. History Financial management has always been key to a successful business, and is crucial for an economy to function. There are not only companies and individuals that have economies that rely on financial management but also entire societies and countries. Examples * From 2007 till 2015 the Feyenoord company \\"list en bedrog\\" was responsible for the financial mismanagement inside the top of the direction. Eric Gudde also called the \\"self employed dictator of the republic Feyenoord-Korea\\" (portmanteau of \\"Feyenoord\\" and \\"Noord-Korea\\", Dutch for \\"North Korea\\"). Together with Martin van Geel he was responsible for destroying the total club. During this period there were no consequences for the two self-employed dictators of the republic Feyenoord-Korea. Throughout the years there have been infinite companies, persons and also countries that have been declared bankrupt, caused by financial mismanagement. By taking a look at some of the world's largest economies we can find cases where the financial management has somehow gone wrong and will depict how severe the effect of financial mismanagement can actually lead out to be. * Argentina, with its many natural resources, well-educated workforce and export-oriented agricultural sector, is today Latin America's third largest economy, but the Argentine economy has been through quite a few ups and downs. In 2001 this led to a severe recession and ever-increasing poverty. The country's increasing public debt was one of the reasons for the recession. * By the end of 2009 Greece experienced one of the most severe economical collapses in today's society. The crisis had severe results and for instance resulted in great public poverty. In Athens, 20 per cent of the shops were all of a sudden completely empty and in February 2012 it was reported that 20,000 Greeks, during the proceeding year had been made destitute. By years of unrestrained governmental spending, cheap lending and a failing try at implementing financial reforms Greece was left badly off when the global economical crisis struck and the country had loans they were completely unable to repay. *In 2008 the company Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, after being the fourth largest investment bank in the U.S at the time. By lending severe amounts to fund the company's investing for example housing-related assets, made the financial services firm extremely exposed to the financial downturn and subprime crisis. There are numerous examples of where finances are not managed right and where companies, individuals and even countries are liquidated, and even more examples where there has been episodes of financial mismanagement but the situation was still able to be escaped. Prevention Financial mismanagement will always be a possible problem, for businesses, individuals and also entire countries. To prevent personal financial mismanagement it is important to have financial education from an early age. For a business to succeed in their finances it is crucial to employ people with the right qualifications and experiences and to continuously appraise the financial state within the business.

Founded in 1852 by the De La Salle Brothers, it is the first Catholic school and the third-oldest secondary school in Singapore. From 2013, SJI offers a dual-track education comprising the GCE Ordinary Level Programme (OP) and the Integrated Programme (IP) track. The IP track which leads to the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), which integrates the four-year secondary education with a two-year IBDP, where IP students can proceed onto the two-year IBDP without the need to complete the O-level examinations at the end of their 4th year. The OP students will take their GCE 'O' level examinations at the end of their fourth year. Based on their O-level examination results, they can apply to continue the IBDP at SJI, or pursue courses at other junior colleges or polytechnics. The school had its first IP intake at Secondary 1 and Secondary 3 in 2013 and 2014 respectively while the first IBDP intake was in 2013. History St Joseph's Institution (SJI), originally known as St. John's Institution, was founded in 1852 as the first missionary establishment of the De La Salle Brothers in the Far East. This endeavour was initiated by Rev Fr Jean-Marie Beurel MEP, who offered the opportunity to six Brothers from Europe to start the school using a former chapel as premises. Within a year, an attap hut had to be erected to accommodate all the students. On 19 March 1855 (Feast of Saint Joseph), the cornerstone of a new school building was laid, and from that date, the school came to be known as St. Joseph's Institution. The new central classroom block was completed in 1865, though the further expansion of the facilities continued well into the 20th century. The school had 426 students in 1900. This grew to almost 1200 in 1914, and 1600 in 1922. With the student population expanding, a temporary branch school was opened, which eventually led to the building of a second school – Saint Patrick's School, Singapore – in 1933. During World War II, prior to the fall of Singapore to the Japanese, the school was used as a Red Cross hospital and housed a unit of the Civil Defence Force, the A.R.F. (Air Raid Precautionary Group). On 16 February 1942, a bomb hit the school courtyard during the war, leaving a crater, but the main building remained unscathed. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the school was renamed to Bras Basah Road Boys' School. The Brothers were soon asked to 'resign'. The school and hostel were run along military lines. However, three weeks after the Japanese surrender, the Brothers returned and St Joseph's was re-opened and normal lessons resumed. In 1954, St. Joseph's Junior School was housed in St. Michael's School, now known as St. Joseph's Institution Junior (SJIJ). In 1975, St Joseph's Institution's first-year pre- university classes and some of its teachers were transferred to the newly opened Catholic Junior College. In 1988, St Joseph's Institution shifted into a new campus at Malcolm Road situated just off the neighbourhood of Toa Payoh, beside the Tanglin Community Centre. The old campus, with its distinctive semi-circular wings, was gazetted by the Singapore National Heritage Board as a national monument. It now houses the Singapore Art Museum.Institute of Brothers of the Christian Schools (La Salle Brothers), on the second floor of the portico of the former SJI campus at Bras Basah. Under the administration of Brother Paul Anthony Rogers, St Joseph's Institution saw its peak in growth. In 1995, a Performing Arts Centre (PAC) and a new wing to house Secondary One students were added. In 2002, St Joseph's Institution celebrated its 150th anniversary. In 2006, St Joseph's Institution, upon the urging of the Economic Development Board, began an international school. SJI International (St Joseph's Institution International) began classes in January 2007. The School started with just over 100 students but now boasts more than 1200 students across both its Elementary School and High School. This remarkable success is due to the dedication of the Old Boys and the faith of the parents. St Joseph's Institution International High School offers the IGCSE and the IB Diploma Programme (IBDP), similar to the Senior School of St Joseph's Institution, at Malcolm Road, today. It was also the first year in which only pure sciences were offered to every candidate. In 2008, the school was re-validated with the Singapore Quality Class Award, obtained, for the second time, the Best Practice Award (Teaching and Learning) and attained the Best Practice Award (Student All-Round Development) in the MOE External Validation exercise. The school received consecutive Sustained Achievement Awards in Academic Value-Added, Sports, Uniformed Groups and Fitness. In 2009, St Joseph's Institution was recognised by the Ministry of Education with a pinnacle award – The School of Excellence Award. The School Excellence Award (SEA) recognises schools for their excellence in both education processes and outcomes. It is the highest and most prestigious award in the Masterplan of Awards framework in MOE, Singapore. In 2013, St Joseph's Institution took in its first intake of Year 5 male and female students under the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), with an inaugural batch of 80 students admitted. That same year, St Joseph's Institution also had its first intake of secondary 1 male students into its Integrated Programme (IP) which will culminate with the IBDP when they are year 5. St Joseph's Institution also bolstered its academic staff and upgraded its facilities for the IBDP student block to provide the necessary infrastructure and support for the students to develop to their fullest potential. At the end of 2013, St Joseph's Institution moved to a holding campus at Bishan Street 14, while the main campus at Malcolm Road was undergoing renovations. At the start of 2014, St Joseph's Institution had its first intake of year 3 boys into the 3rd year of their IP course. On 20 July 2015, works to redevelop the school began, with a new target of moving back by March 2017.http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/sji-starts-upgrading-work-malcolm- road-campus On 9 January 2017, St Joseph's Institution moved back to their main campus at 38 Malcolm Road, after two years of renovations. On 22 July 2017, St Joseph's Institution celebrated its 165th anniversary in Singapore.http://www.sji.edu.sg/about-sji/campus-redevelopment-updates St Joseph's Institution has been a Gold Value Added school for the GCE 'O' Level examinations.

Confessionalists believe that differing interpretations or understandings, especially those in direct opposition to a held teaching, cannot be accommodated within a church communion. Confessionalism can become a matter of practical relevance in fields such as Christian education and Christian politics. For example, there is a question over whether Christian schools should attempt to enforce a specific religious doctrine, or whether they should simply teach general \\"Christian values\\". Similarly, some Christian political parties have been split over whether non-Christians should be allowed to participate — confessionalists, arguing against it, stress the importance of religious doctrine, while non-confessionalists say that shared values are more important than adherence to exact beliefs. The comparative study of confessions is termed symbolics from the term \\"symbol\\" used to describe a creed or larger confession. History Historically, the term confessionalism for the first time was used in mid-19th century. Of course the phenomenon of confessionalism and the term “confession”, from which the term confessionalism derived, is much older, referring to once individual belief, then collective belief. Furthermore, the term confession in different languages implies different notions (faith or denomination in English, croyance, culte, communauté religieuse in French). Adherents of confessional churches have often made a public profession of faith to declare agreement with their particular confession. In the 16th and 17th centuries the term confession was only used for the documents of belief (cf. Confessio Augustana) while the religious communities of Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists were referred to as “religious parties”, different “religions” or “churches” - not as confessions. In the late 18th century the term confession started to expand to religious bodies sharing a common creed. The first evidence is the Wöllner and Prussian Religious Edict of 1788 (though there might be earlier proofs for the English-speaking world). The international Congress of Vienna in 1815 still didn’t use the term confession to mark different Christian denominations. Labelling Christian groups “confessions” implied a certain degree of civil progress and tolerance, accepting that other parties also claimed absolute truth. The original intention to pacify conflicts between the denominations in the 19th century turned into its opposite: Confession bore the ground for new conflicts, as for example in the Cologne conflict about mixed marriages in 1837 (article in German). The Roman Catholic Church refused to consider itself as merely a confession. However ahistorical the terminology (cf. the latest semantical research of L. Hölscher), historians talk about the Early Modern period as a “confessional age” (first evidence: Ernst Troeltsch, 1906) and with good reasons use the terms of confessionalization and confessionalism. In the third half or the 19th century the term confessionalism occurred in dictionaries. It referred to internal Protestant conflicts (orthodoxy v. “living” Protestantism), to conflicts between different confessional groups, to everyday resentments and to any exaggerated emphasis of religious identity against competing identities. The Catholic Staatslexikon in 1959 defines Confessionalism as the “endeavour of the confessions to defend their religious doctrine” and their identity, in opposition to indifferentism, but it also meant the “overemphasis of confessional differences, esp. transferring them into the realm of state and society”. In later editions of dictionaries there is no lemma any more since the phenomenon lost its wider impact. Confessionalism exerted a severe impact on European social and political history between 1530 and 1648 and again between 1830 and the 1960s. Nowadays confessionalism is of minor relevance in European state churches. It rose to importance in the early 19th century and vanished in the 1960s. This is why some scholars talk about this time-period as a \\"second confessional age\\", comparing the dimensions of confessionalism with the \\"first confessional age\\" (16th to 17th centuries, for example Lutheran orthodoxy, Reformed scholasticism, Tridentine-era Catholicism, and the Thirty-nine Articles in Anglicanism). In intra-Christian dialogue, confessionalism was a significant consideration during the colloquies of Regensburg, Marburg, Montbéliard, and Kassel. However, various European free churches today consider their confessions to be important, for example, the Evangelical Lutheran Free Church and the Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church both require clergy and congregations to declare a quia subscription to the Book of Concord, as such the denominations are classified as being Confessional Lutheran. In Lebanon, the concept of confessionalism holds an important political meaning, since political power and governmental bureaucracy are organized according to religious confessions (as it happened in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries before). For example, the National Pact (an unwritten covenant) and later the Taif Agreement provide for a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister, and a Shia Muslim speaker of parliament. This is an example of confessionalism (politics). Controversy The idea of confessionalism can generate considerable controversy. Some Christian denominations, particularly newer ones, focus more on the \\"experience\\" of Christianity than on its formal doctrines, and are accused by confessionalists of adopting a vague and unfocused form of religion. Anti-confessionalists, declaring that the confessionalist view of religion is too narrow and that people should be able to seek religion in their own way, generally argue that it is the spirit and values of religion that matter, rather than the particular rules. Confessionalists generally counter that the \\"spirit and values\\" of any given faith cannot be attained without first knowing truth as given in formal dogmas.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The house and grounds replaced Brantridge farmhouse and farm. Sir Robert Loder acquired the estate in 1849, and by 1874, Brantridge Park mansion had been built. Standing in Brantridge Forest, it was the seat of Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone (and brother of Queen Mary), and his wife, Princess Alice of Albany, the last surviving grandchild of Queen Victoria. They leased the house from Lord Cowdray from 1922 onwards. The Princess Beatrice, youngest and last surviving child of Queen Victoria, also lived in Brantridge Park with her niece, Princess Alice, until her death in her sleep here on 26 October 1944, aged 87. Sir Denys Lowson, at one time Lord Mayor of London, lived there for some years after the Athlones. The house was then used as a home for disabled children. The house today More recently the house was divided into apartments, and operated as a time-share resort until January 2008. In December 2016, Brantridge Park was bought by the architect Anders Dahl and his wife, Fiona Bigwood. The two Olympic dressage riders plan to transform the grounds to an equestrian centre.

The bicoherence takes values bounded between 0 and 1, which make it a convenient measure for quantifying the extent of phase coupling in a signal. The prefix bi- in bispectrum and bicoherence refers not to two time series xt, yt but rather to two frequencies of a single signal. The bispectrum is a statistic used to search for nonlinear interactions. The Fourier transform of the second-order cumulant, i.e., the autocorrelation function, is the traditional power spectrum. The Fourier transform of C3(t1,t2) (third-order cumulant) is called bispectrum or bispectral density. They fall in the category of Higher Order Spectra, or Polyspectra and provide supplementary information to the power spectrum. The third order polyspectrum (bispectrum) is the easiest to compute, and hence the most popular. The difference with measuring coherence (coherence analysis is an extensively used method to study the correlations in frequency domain, between two simultaneously measured signals) is the need for both input and output measurements by estimating two auto-spectra and one cross spectrum. On the other hand, bicoherence is an auto-quantity, i.e. it can be computed from a single signal. The coherence function provides a quantification of deviations from linearity in the system which lies between the input and output measurement sensors. The bicoherence measures the proportion of the signal energy at any bifrequency that is quadratically phase coupled. It is usually normalized in the range similar to correlation coefficient and classical (second order) coherence. It was also used for depth of anasthesia assessment and widely in plasma physics (nonlinear energy transfer) and also for detection of gravitation waves. Bispectrum and bicoherence may be applied to the case of non-linear interactions of a continuous spectrum of propagating waves in one dimension. Bicoherence measurements have been carried out for EEG signals monitoring in sleep, wakefulness and seizures.  Definition  The bispectrum is defined as the triple product :B(f_1,f_2) = F(f_1)F(f_2)F^*(f_1+f_2) where B is the bispectrum evaluated at frequencies f_1 and f_2, F is the Fourier transform of the signal, and ^* denotes the complex conjugate. The Fourier transform is a complex quantity, and so is the bispectrum. From complex multiplication, the magnitude of the bispectrum is equal to the product of the magnitudes of each of the frequency components, and the phase of the bispectrum is the sum of the phases of each of the frequency components. Suppose that the three Fourier components F(f_1), F(f_2) and F(f_1 + f_2) were perfectly phase locked. Then if the Fourier transform was calculated several times from different parts of the time series, the bispectrum will always have the same value. If we add together all of the bispectra, they will sum without cancelling. On the other hand, suppose that the phases of each of these frequencies was random. Then, the bispectrum will have the same magnitude (assuming that the magnitude of the frequency components is the same) but the phase will be randomly oriented. Adding together all of the bispectra will result in cancellation, because of the random phase orientation, and so the sum of the bispectra will have a small magnitude. Detecting phase coupling requires summation over a number of independent samples- this is the first motivation for defining the bicoherence. Secondly, the bispectrum is not normalized, because it still depends on the magnitudes of each of the frequency components. The bicoherence includes a normalization factor that removes the magnitude dependence. There is some inconsistency with the definition of the bicoherence normalization constant. Some of the definitions that have been used are :b(f_1,f_2) = \\\\frac{\\\\left \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n} F_n(f_1)F_n(f_2)F_n^*(f_1+f_2) \\\\right}{ \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum\\\\limits_{n} F_n(f_1)^2F_n(f_2)^2F_n^*(f_1+f_2)^2}} which was provided in Sigl and Chamoun 1994, but does not appear to be correctly normalized. Alternatively, plasma physics typically uses :b^2(f_1,f_2) = \\\\frac{\\\\langle F_n(f_1)F_n(f_2)F_n^*(f_1+f_2) \\\\rangle^2}{ \\\\langle F_n(f_1)F_n(f_2)^2 \\\\rangle\\\\langle F_n^*(f_1+f_2)^2\\\\rangle} where the angle brackets denote averaging. Note that this is the same as using a sum, because n is the same in the numerator and the denominator. This definition is directly from Nagashima 2006, and is also referred to in He 2009 and Maccarone 2005. Finally, one of the most intuitive definitions comes from Hagihira 2001 and Hayashi 2007, which is :b(f_1,f_2) = \\\\frac{\\\\left \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n} F_n(f_1)F_n(f_2)F_n^*(f_1+f_2) \\\\right}{ \\\\sum\\\\limits_{n} F_n(f_1)F_n(f_2)F_n^*(f_1+f_2)} The numerator contains the magnitude of the bispectrum summed over all of the time series segments. This quantity is large if there is phase coupling, and approaches 0 in the limit of random phases. The denominator, which normalizes the bispectrum, is given by calculating the bispectrum after setting all of the phases to 0. This corresponds to the case where there is perfect phase coupling, because all of the samples have zero phase. Therefore, the bicoherence has a value between 0 (random phases) and 1 (total phase coupling).

He is known in Chinese history for making the best of his mission into foreign territory. During his mission he was captured and then detained for nineteen years, enduring major hardship at least in the early years of his captivity. Nevertheless, he endured this treatment while remaining faithful to his mission and his homeland. According to Chinese tradition, in the early stages of his captivity, Su Wu was so deprived of food that he only survived in the cold north lands by eating his coverings, then enduring long years of servitude herding sheep, before managing to return home. He was able to return home after deceiving his captors with a story about his having sent a message back to China by means of tying a letter on the leg of a wild goose. Su's loyalty to the Han Dynasty is emphasised by the story that during his detainment he married a wife, that he had children by her, but that he chose to return to his homeland, even though it meant abandoning his wife and children. Mission to Xiongnu Su Wu Little is known about Su's life or career other than his mission beyond the borders of China involving the Xiongnu, a mission which turned out to be drastically more trying and lengthy than expected. In 100 BC, there was a short-lived détente between long-term adversaries the Han and the Xiongnu. One year earlier, in 101 BC, a new chanyu had come to power in Xiongnu, Chanyu Qiedihou (), who had expressed an interest in peace with the Han and who, as a goodwill gesture, had allowed some Han diplomats who had been detained by the Xiongnu to return to Han, along with gifts from the chanyu. In response, in 100 BC, Emperor Wu of Han commissioned Su, then the deputy commander of the imperial guards, to serve as an ambassador to Xiongnu. His deputy was fellow deputy commander, Zhang Sheng (), and the third in command was Chang Hui (). However, once they arrived at the Xiongnu chanyu's headquarters, Chanyu Qiedihou was far more arrogant than expected, which angered Zhang. In response, Zhang plotted with two Xiongnu officials, the Prince of Gou () and Yu Chang (), to assassinate Chanyu Qiedihou's half-Chinese advisor Wei Lü () and kidnap the chanyu's mother. The Prince of Gou and Yu Chang carried out their plot while the chanyu was away on a hunt, but someone alerted the chanyu, who quickly returned and killed the Prince of Gou in battle and captured Yu. Yu admitted to plotting with Zhang. Zhang, alarmed, informed Su, who had been unaware of Zhang's plot. Aware that the chanyu was planning on forcing him to surrender to Xiongnu, Su tried to preserve his dignity by committing suicide with his sword. Wei, who had wanted Su to surrender and become an advisor to the chanyu as well, quickly summoned doctors and was able to just save Su's life. Chanyu Qiedihou, impressed with Su's heroism, also sent messengers to care for Su's recovery, while putting Zhang and Chang under arrest. After Su recovered, Chanyu Qiedihou decided to publicly execute Yu as an example and to force the entire Han mission to surrender. Zhang became apprehensive and surrendered. Su, however, was not shaken even when Wei put his sword onto Su's neck while Zhang tried to explain that he would be greatly honoured to be the chanyu's advisor. Su rebuked him for his faithlessness to Han and refused to surrender. Life in exile Portrait of Su Wu by Watanabe Kazan (1793-1841), Edo period, dated 1839 (Tenpo 10), light colour on silk - Tokyo National Museum - DSC06123 Unable to force Su to surrender, Chanyu Qiedihou decided to try to torture him by starvation, and so put him in a cellar without food and drink. However, for several days, Su survived by consuming wool from his coat and the snow that fell into the cellar. The chanyu was further surprised and thought that the gods were protecting him. The chanyu then exiled him to Lake Baikal and ordered him to tend a flock of sheep, telling him that he would be allowed to go home when the sheep produced young. (It is conjectured, with some evidence based on correspondence later between Su and Li Ling that the chanyu gave Su a Xiongnu wife, and she bore him children.) During exile, Su often lacked food, as the food supplies coming from the Xiongnu headquarters were not arriving steadily. He often had to resort to eating grass roots and wild rodents. Regardless of the difficulties, however, Su always held onto the imperial staff () given to all imperial messengers, and he used it as the shepherd's rod so much that the decorative hairs on the staff eventually all fell off. Twice, during exile, the chanyu sent Li Ling, who had surrendered to Xiongnu after being defeated on the battlefield in 99 BC, to visit Su. The first time, Li informed Su that his two brothers had both been accused of crimes and committed suicide; that his mother had died; and that his wife had remarried. He tried to convince Su to surrender, but Su refused. On the second occasion, Li informed him of Emperor Wu's passing, and Su was so despondent that in mourning that he vomited blood. When the Emperor of Han died, Su Wu faced south towards his old homeland of China and wept in utter sadness. Return to Han In 81 BC, Han was again in a détente with Xiongnu, when Han ambassadors inquired of Su's fate. The Xiongnu government claimed that Su had long died. However, Su's old assistant Chang Hui secretly informed the ambassadors of Su's exile, and the ambassadors, under Chang's suggestion, told then chanyu Huyandi () that Emperor Zhao had killed a migratory goose while hunting, and that a letter from Su seeking help was found on the bird's foot. Surprised, Chanyu Huyandi admitted that Su was in fact still alive, recalled him and allowed him as well as his nine followers to go home. In all, he was in exile for 19 years. Once Su returned to Han, he was given the position of Director of Colonization (), a high-ranking official post. He remained in that post at least until the early years of Emperor Xuan's reign—late 70s BC. In 51 BC, when Emperor Xuan, in gratitude to 11 key officials who served him well, had their portraits painted onto the main gallery of the main imperial palace, Su was one of the 11 so portrayed. Impact on Chinese history Su was often regarded as the epitome of faithful service in light of great odds and trials. His story was often invoked when acts of great faith or courage were performed by officials. His story, as undetailed as it was in actual history, often became subjects of drama, poetry, and songs throughout Chinese history. Many people take him as a second Zhang Qian, who was also previously caught in the same situation, refused to surrender, and managed to escape back to Han China.

History of the record Minutemen's first record occurred almost immediately after they opened for Black Flag in Minutemen's hometown of San Pedro, California. Black Flag guitarist Greg Ginn offered the group a chance to record and release a record, and a late night session at Media Art Studio in Hermosa Beach, California was booked. The group recorded all seven songs in the order in which they appear on the record, with no overdubbing except for backing vocals by the group and drummer George Hurley's brother Greg. At the beginning of \\"Joe McCarthy's Ghost\\", bassist Mike Watt can be heard telling guitarist D. Boon and the Hurley brothers, \\"You just sing 'Joe McCarthy', want to do that?\\". A discussion between the four participants can be heard underneath George Hurley's previously recorded drum introduction. Ginn later told Minutemen how to put out a record, which spurred Watt and Boon to form New Alliance Records later that year. The EP also appears as part of the My First Bells cassette (1985) and the Post-Mersh Vol. 3 CD.

Howland and S.S. Howland. HistoryFounding= The Pacific Mail Steamship Company was established to carry US mail on the Pacific leg of a transcontinental route via Panama. The federal government discussed the possibility of creating subsidies for a private shipping company, similar to the model already established in Britain for the Cunard Line and the British Mail Steam Packet Company. Such a policy served the larger objective of annexing and developing Oregon. President James K. Polk brought the Oregon Territory into the Union in 1846. Developing and maintaining the new land required the development of faster transportation and communications between the eastern seaboard and the remote northwest. At first the federal mail subsidy program served a second objective: the establishment of civilian steamships which could be easily converted to warships or privateers during times of war. Thus the 1845 federal enabling legislation vested authority of mail contracts with the Secretary of the US Navy. His dual mandate was letting federal mail contracts and overseeing the construction of the steamers to ensure that they would be suitable for conversion to warships. In accordance to Polk’s aggressive program for developing Oregon, Congress passed more specific laws in for mail subsidies early in 1847. The new laws approved funding for four naval steamers, directed the US Department of the Navy to supervise the construction of these ships, and directed the Secretary of the Navy to contract with private carriers to carry US Mail to Oregon via Panama. Initially they planned for monthly mail service. One set of ships was to serve the Atlantic leg between the eastern US and Panama; the other set was to serve the Pacific leg. Secretary Mason set the terms for the Pacific mail contract: a steamer would be required to sail from Panama to Astoria, Oregon in thirty days or less. He awarded the first contract to Arnold Harris, a straw buyer from Arkansas. The contract paid $199,000 annually and was in effect for ten years. Just days later, Harris assigned the mail contract to William H. Aspinwall, who brought in three partners: Edwin Bartlett, Henry Chauncey, and Gardiner G. Howland. They incorporated the Pacific Mail Steamship Company on April 12, 1848 with a capital stock of $500,000. =California Gold Rush= The first three steamships constructed for Pacific Mail were the , of 1050 tons, the SS Oregon, of 1250 tons, and the SS Panama, of 1058 tons. The company initially believed it would be transporting agricultural goods from the West Coast, but just as operations began, gold was found in the Sierra Nevada, and business boomed almost from the start. During the California Gold Rush in 1849, the company was a key mover of goods and people and played a key role in the growth of San Francisco, California. In addition to their maritime activities Pacific Mail also ran some of the earliest steamboats on the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, between San Francisco, Sacramento, and Stockton. Domingo Marcucci came from Philadelphia in the Pacific Mail steamship SS Oregon with a knocked-down steamboat in its hold. He started a shipyard in San Francisco on September 18, 1849, on the beach at Happy Valley, at the foot of Folsom Street, east of Beale Street. Marcucci's company assembled the Captain Sutter in six weeks. Built for the Aspinwall Steam Transportation Line, owned by George W. Aspinwall, brother of William Henry Aspinwall, it was one of the first steamboats that ran between San Francisco and Stockton, in 1849.

Olmsted, Vanished Waters: A History of San Francisco's Mission Bay\\", Mission Creek Conservancy, 1986, Chapter 7, Steamboat Point, 1851-1864 Foundsf.org accessed February 19, 2015 Also for the Pacific Mail, Marcucci next converted the 153 ton side-wheel steamboat El Dorado that had been rigged as a 3 masted schooner for the trip around Cape Horn, to be used for the Sacramento run. Subsequently in March 1850, for the same company, he assembled the Georgiana, a small 30 ton side-wheel steamboat made in Philadelphia, knocked down and sent by sea also for the Sacramento run. That April Georgiana pioneered the shortcut route between Sacramento and Stockton through a slough in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta that was between the Sacramento River and Mokelumne River, which afterward became known as Georgiana Slough. =1850–1869= In 1850, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company established a steamship line competing with the U.S. Mail Steamship Company between New York City and Chagres. George Law placed an opposition line of steamers (SS Antelope, SS Columbus, SS Isthumus, SS Republic) in the Pacific, running from Panama to San Francisco. In April 1851, the rivalry was ended when the U.S. Mail Steamship Company purchased Pacific Mail steamers on the Atlantic side, and George Law sold his new company and its ships to the Pacific Mail. One of the company's steamships, the SS Winfield Scott, acquired when the New York and California Steamship Company went out of business, ran aground on Anacapa Island in 1853. In 1854, Marshall Owen Roberts purchased Law's interest and became president of Pacific Mail. 1906 Advertisement from The World Today magazine 1915 Advertisement showing new ships in Trans Pacific service. During the American Civil War the ships of the Pacific Mail, that carried the gold and silver of the western mines to the eastern states were under threat from the Confederate Navy in the form of commerce raiders, and several plots to seize one of their steamships for its precious cargo or to convert it into a raider to capture one of its other ships with such cargo. After one of these plots, that of the Salvador Pirates came to light, to prevent any further attempts to seize Pacific coast shipping, General McDowell ordered each passenger on board American merchant steamers to surrender all weapons when boarding the ship and every passenger and his baggage was searched. All officers were armed for the protection of their ships. Detachments of Union soldiers sailed with Pacific Mail steamers.Aurora Hunt, The Army of the Pacific; Its operations in California, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, plains region, Mexico, etc. 1860-1866, The Pacific Squadron of 1861-1866, pp.314-315. In 1867, the company launched the first regularly scheduled trans-Pacific steamship service with a route between San Francisco, Hong Kong, and Yokohama, and extended service to Shanghai. This route led to an influx of Japanese and Chinese immigrants, bringing additional cultural diversity to California. As the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroads met in Utah in 1869, the profitability of the Pacific Mail on the run from Panama to San Francisco ended. Many of its ships were sold or put on other routes. =1870–1949 = Pacific Mail Steamship Company shipping lines world map as of December 1921 While docked at San José de Guatemala, the Pacific Mail steamship SS Acapulco was involved in the Barrundia Affair of 1890. General Juan Martín Barrundia, a Guatemalan rebel general wanted by the Guatemalan government, was killed aboard ship after an attempted arrest by Guatemalan police, who hauled down the American flag and raised the Guatemalan flag in its place. The affair led to the recall of the U.S. Minister to Central America, Lansing Bond Mizner, by President Benjamin Harrison. The company was a charter member of the Dow Jones Transportation Average. In 1925, the company was purchased by Robert Dollar, of the Dollar Steamship Company. With the government bail-out of the Dollar Line in 1938, ownership passed to American President Lines, but by this time, PMSS essentially existed only on paper. It was formally closed down in 1949, after just over a century of existence.

She was wrecked near Taichow Islands, Wenzhou, South China in 1911. * SS Persia (1906-1915) Built by Harland & Wolff in 1881 as the White Star Line's Coptic. Initially chartered to the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company, she was sold to Pacific Mail after the winding up of the former company. Later sold to the Japanese Oriental Steam Ship Co. She was scrapped in 1926. * SS Peru (1892) (1892-1915) A steamship built by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, for Pacific Mail launched June 11, 1892. Peru, official number 150595, was the largest steel freight and passenger ship ever built on the Pacific coast at the time. Peru entered the San Francisco to China and Japan route August 1892. The ship was briefly with Grace Line and then sold to a French line and renamed Lux about 1915. Lux went missing in the Mediterranean in 1920 on a voyage from Marseille to Oran. * SS China 10,200 ton steamship. * SS Nile 11,000 ton steamship. * SS Korea 18,000 ton twin screw steamship. * SS Siberia 18,000 ton twin screw steamship. * SS Manchuria (1903-1915) 27,000 ton twin screw steamship. * SS Mongolia (1904-1915) 27,000 ton twin screw steamship.

Its name is a backronym for Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics, a reflection of the fact that sex work tends to be stigmatized primarily because of society-imposed standards of ethics. COYOTE's goals include the decriminalization (as opposed to the legalization) of prostitution, pimping and pandering, as well as the elimination of social stigma concerning sex work as an occupation. COYOTE provides counseling and legal referrals for sex workers, and assistance in leaving sex work for different careers. Services COYOTE provides expert advice and sensitivity training for social service and law enforcement agencies that deal with sex workers. COYOTE members have testified as expert witnesses during trials. The organization works to educate the general public about sex work, and promotes education about safe sex, AIDS and sexually transmitted disease among sex workers, their clients and the general public. History COYOTE was founded in San Francisco in 1973 by Margo St. James, a feminist and former sex worker, along with Jennifer James, a Seattle-based professor of anthropology. Margo St. James had previously been arrested and convicted of a prostitution offense at age 25, but overturned the conviction after studying law for a year at Lincoln University San Francisco. She chose the name COYOTE because novelist Tom Robbins called her a \\"coyote trickster\\" and came up with \\"Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics\\" to fit the chosen backronym. St. James believed that sex work should be considered labor equivalent to any other career, writing in 1977 that \\"to make a great distinction between being paid for an hour's sexual services, or an hour's typing, or an hour's acting on a stage is to make a distinction that is not there.\\"Chapkis, Wendy. Live Sex Acts: Women Performing Erotic Labor (1997, Routledge, New York). . =Purpose= The group's purpose was \\"to provide a loose union of women—both prostitutes and feminists—to fight for legal change.\\" COYOTE provided safe spaces for sex workers to meet to talk about their experiences and find support. They had \\"rap sessions\\" which used feminist consciousness raising methods, and let the women know that they were not alone in their experiences. They gathered stories and facts about the injustices sex workers faced and launched a public education drive to highlight the racist and sexist biases of prostitution arrests. Meetings and events were advertised through underground newspapers. COYOTE organized educational programs and cultural events to raise money for other projects and held public demonstrations to protest entrapment. They also organized \\"whore conventions\\" in San Francisco (1974), Washington, DC (1976), and in Brussels and Amsterdam (1985 and 1986). =Programs and Services= COYOTE offered a variety of services to sex workers. They offered a hotline for prostitutes called SLIP (Survival Line for Independent Prostitutes), immediate legal assistance for prostitutes who had been arrested, suitable clothing for court appearances, and classes on survival skills for prostitutes in jail. COYOTE won policy changes in the 1970s that gradually diminished prostitution laws. They abolished mandatory penicillin therapy and multi-day jail quarantines and pressured public defenders to provide better representation for people accused of soliciting and prostitution, misdemeanor offenses. They instigated and sponsored at least 26 lawsuits on behalf of prostitutes and lifted a mandatory three-day venereal disease quarantine imposed by the San Francisco Police Department on prostitutes. They won by claiming that the incidence of VD disease is at least as high among people 20 to 40 years old as among whores and \\"only women are arrested and forced to have regular checks for VD.\\" COYOTE got a judge to dismiss prostitution charges against 37 women whose male customers were not arrested and they organized protests against police harassment, which they believed was one of the most critical issues affecting prostitutes. COYOTE threw annual Hookers' Balls from 1973–1979 in San Francisco, which served to destigmatize sex work, celebrate sex workers, and raise funds. From these events, COYOTE raised a bail fund to free women from exploitative pimps and created special welfare programs and assistance services. As public concern about the AIDS epidemic grew, sex workers were increasingly blamed for spreading the disease. COYOTE immediately sought to address this, stating that the organization was \\"working to prevent the scapegoating of prostitutes for AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, and to educate prostitutes, their clients, and the general public about prevention of these disease\\". The organization spoke out against mandatory testing for sex workers for AIDS, deeming it a violation of civil rights. Various members of COYOTE joined together in 1988 to form the California Prostitutes Education Project (CAL- PEP), aiming to provide education about sex work from sex workers themselves. CAL-PEP published Prostitutes Prevent AIDS: A Manual for Health Education in 1988 with federal and state funding. = Affiliations = Shortly after the founding of COYOTE, Association of Seattle Prostitutes (ASP) and Prostitutes of New York (PONY) were founded. There were roughly 20 other \\"sister organizations\\" founded by 1979. As COYOTE gained credibility as a national movement, it gained affiliations with more liberal and mainstream feminist organizations such as the National Organization for Women (NOW), Wages for Housework, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the American Bar Association. These affiliations were possible in part due to COYOTE's wide support base, which at one point consisted of 270,000 members. =COYOTE v. Roberts= In 1976, COYOTE, led by St. James, filed a lawsuit against Rhode Island. In the case, COYOTE v. Roberts, the argument was based on how much power the state should have to control the sexual activity of its citizens. The lawsuit also alleged discrimination on how the law was being applied. Data was submitted that demonstrated selective prosecution: the Providence police were arresting female sex workers far more often than the male customers. St. James testified in the case. Although the case eventually was dismissed when Rhode Island General Assembly changed the prostitution statute in 1980, COYOTE and St. James are given credit as one of the reasons prostitution in Rhode Island was decriminalized, although prostitution was outlawed again in 2009 (see Prostitution in Rhode Island). \\"Samantha\\" and Gloria Lockett were co- directors of COYOTE in the early 1990s. They had been critical of the group for focusing on \\"higher class\\" prostitutes (such as call girls and escorts) and white sex workers, while ignoring the concerns of streetwalkers and ethnic minorities. , Norma Jean Almodovar serves as the executive director of the Los Angeles branch of COYOTE.

Budd based the Amfleet design on its earlier Metroliner electric multiple unit. An initial order for 57 cars in 1973 to supplement the Metroliners on the Northeast Corridor grew to two orders totaling 642 cars, sufficient to reequip all the services on the Northeast Corridor and many other routes around the United States. The first 492 cars, known as Amfleet I and completed between 1975–1977, were designed for short-distance service. A second order of 150 cars, known as Amfleet II and completed between 1980–1983, were designed for long-distance service. They were the last intercity passenger cars built by Budd. Car types include both long- and short-distance coaches, cafes, club cars, and lounges. Since the construction of the cars, multiple rebuildings have eliminated the club cars and lounges in favor of business class cars, club-dinettes, and \\"diner-lite\\" dining cars. Amtrak experimented with sleeping car conversions in the 1970s, but did not pursue the idea. The Amfleet I has vestibules on both ends of the car for faster unloading, while the Amfleet II has a single vestibule. The Amfleet II also has slightly larger windows. The Amfleets were the first new locomotive-hauled intercity cars ordered by Amtrak and the first such cars built in the United States since 1965. Their introduction in the mid-1970s led to improved reliability for Amtrak's trains and ridership gains. , Amfleet cars are used extensively in the eastern and midwestern United States, forming the backbone of Amtrak's single-level fleet.  Background  The Budd Metroliners were the basis of the Amfleet design. Amtrak assumed control of almost all private sector intercity passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. It retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (electric and diesel) and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s. These cars were aging, in need of maintenance, and in many cases incompatible with each other. The company recognized the need and opportunity to standardize on a single design. Very few railcars had been built for inter-city service in the United States since the 1950s; the last locomotive-hauled cars were an order of ten coaches built by Pullman-Standard for the Kansas City Southern Railway in 1965. An important exception was the Budd Metroliner electric multiple unit. This fleet of 61 cars had begun operation between Washington, D.C. and New York City on the Northeast Corridor in 1969 under Penn Central and quickly gained acceptance with the traveling public, despite various engineering problems. Writing in the mid-1970s, railroad historian John H. White Jr. described them as \\"Amtrak's brightest star.\\" In 1973, Budd still had the tooling in place from the Metroliner order, meaning that any new order derived from that design could begin almost at once.  History  Amfleet I = Mid-1970s postcard advertising the then-new Amfleet cars Some Amfleets saw service on western long-distance trains until the completion of the Superliner I order. These 1981 Desert Winds had a Heritage Fleet sleeping car, Amfleet I dinette, Hi- Level transition coach, and Superliner I coaches. Amtrak placed a $24 million order with Budd on October 12, 1973 for 57 \\"non-powered Metroliner cars.\\" These, together with new GE E60 electric locomotives, were to provide additional Metroliner service on the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak expanded its plans in June 1974, ordering 200 more cars for $81 million. On October 25, it added another 35 cars. Finally, in April 1975, with the first deliveries imminent, Amtrak added 200 more cars to the order for $86 million. This brought the first order to 492 cars, with a total cost of $192 million. Amtrak intended to use 212 of the cars on Northeast Corridor service between Washington and New York; unlike the electric Metroliners, the Amfleet cars could continue through to Boston, Massachusetts. A public unveiling took place at the Budd plant in Northeast Philadelphia on June 19, 1975, after which four cars were sent to the High Speed Ground Test Center in Pueblo, Colorado for evaluation. The first Amfleet cars began running on the Northeast Corridor on August 5, 1975. Amtrak heralded their arrival, calling 1975 \\"the Year of the Amfleet.\\" As the cars were distributed throughout the system, timetables would note that trains now had \\"Amfleet Service\\" and that trains had been \\"Amfleeted.\\" A 1978 study conducted by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) found that ridership increased 11% on the Amfleet-equipped Northeast Corridor trains, with at least some passengers choosing the slower but more comfortable Amfleets over the faster but less reliable Metroliners. The rollout of Amfleets throughout the system was restricted by the availability of locomotives with HEP or special generator cars. The first route outside the Northeast Corridor to receive Amfleets was the Washington–Martinsburg Blue Ridge, on December 1. By November 1976, 350 Amfleets had been delivered and 78% of Amtrak's short-haul trains used either Amfleets or equally-modern Turboliner trainsets. Besides the Blue Ridge, routes using Amfleets outside the Northeast Corridor included the New York–Newport News, Virginia Colonial, the Chicago, Illinois–Detroit, Michigan Twilight Limited and Wolverine, the Chicago–St. Louis, Missouri Abraham Lincoln and State House, the Chicago–Quincy, Illinois Illinois Zephyr, the Chicago–Carbondale, Illinois Illini and Shawnee, the Chicago–Dubuque, Iowa Black Hawk, the Los Angeles–Bakersfield, California San Joaquin, the Los Angeles–San Diego, California San Diegan, the Portland, Oregon–Seattle, Washington Mount Rainier and Puget Sound, and the Seattle–Vancouver, British Columbia Pacific International. The Amfleet's modern HEP system proved invaluable during the unusually harsh winter of 1976–1977, which sidelined many of Amtrak's aging steam-heated coaches. Amtrak suspended numerous routes and pressed the short- distance Amfleet I coaches into long-distance service. The new EMD F40PH diesel locomotive, itself designed for short-haul service, handled many of these trains. Budd completed delivery of the Amfleet I order on June 9, 1977. = Amfleet II = An AEM-7 hauling Amfleets on a Metroliner service in 1987 The Lake Shore Limited in 2004 with a Heritage Fleet dining car and Amfleet II coaches Amtrak ordered 150 more Amfleet cars from Budd on March 13, 1980, at a cost of $150 million. These cars, dubbed Amfleet II, were intended to replace rolling stock on Amtrak long-distance trains, and featured larger windows, more legroom, and folding legrests. Budd delivered the first four cars on October 28, 1981; the unveiling took place on November 11. The final cars arrived on June 11, 1983. The Amfleet IIs were the last intercity cars Budd built. The continuing unreliability of the original Metroliners led to refurbished Amfleet I coaches displacing them in Metroliner service in 1981. New EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives pulled the trains. Unlike the Superliner- equipped trains in the Western United States, Amtrak's eastern long-distance single-level trains never operated with uniform consists. The trains operated with a combination of Amfleet and Heritage Fleet cars, supplemented in the 1990s by Viewliner sleeping cars. In 1990, Amfleets could be found on every long-haul route east of the Mississippi River: the Virginia–Florida Auto Train; the Chicago–New Orleans City of New Orleans; the New York–Florida Silver Meteor and Silver Star, the New York–Chicago Broadway Limited, Cardinal, and Lake Shore Limited; the Washington, D.C.–Chicago Capitol Limited; the New York–New Orleans Crescent; and the Washington, D.C.–Montreal Montrealer. Horizon Fleet coaches replaced Amfleet coaches on most Midwestern and California short-haul routes in 1989–1990. The Superliner II order in the early 1990s would lead to the removal of Amfleets from the Auto Train and Capitol Limited. The Cardinal used Superliners and terminated at Washington, D.C. between 1995–2002. = Replacement = At the end of 2012, 473 Amfleet I and 145 Amfleet II cars were still in service. The Amfleet I cars had traveled an average of , the Amfleet II cars . The Amfleet I cars continue to be used on corridor services in the Northeastern United States such as the Downeaster, Empire Service, and Northeast Regional, although they can also be found in the Midwest and California. Amfleet IIs continue to be used on single-level long- distance trains. Amtrak announced an overhaul of the Amfleet I interiors in September 2017. The following year, Amtrak began to investigate options to replace the Amfleet I cars altogether. In January 2019, Amtrak issued a Request for Proposals to replace the 470 Amfleet I cars and Ex-Metroliner cab cars then in use. Proposals were due on May 1, 2019. In May 2020, excursion operator Railexco purchased three Amfleet cars from Amtrak - the first Amfleet cars to be sold for private reuse.  Design  A conductor stands in the vestibule on an Amfleet I coach. The trapdoors are in the closed position As designed, the Amfleet I cars could operate at speeds up to . Both the Amfleet I and Amfleet II are now rated for . Electric heating and air conditioning, operated by head-end power (HEP) from the locomotive, are used to maintain passenger comfort. Budd moved the air vents from the bottom, where they had been on the Metroliner, to the top of the car. The top-mounted vents were less susceptible to clogging during snowfall. An Amfleet car is tall, wide, and long. The car body itself is built up from spot-welded stainless steel sections. The Budd Pioneer trucks have dual disc brakes on each axle; a later rebuild added tread brakes. The wheels have a diameter of . The cars meet the FRA's buff strength requirement of . The interior design recalled contemporary jet airliners. In common with airliners the cars featured narrow windows, which inhibited sight-seeing. The windows on the Amfleet I cars were ; this was increased to in the Amfleet II. Another factor in choosing small windows was the high incidence of rocks thrown at train windows in the 1970s. Reinforcing the impression of traveling in an airliner, the passenger seats themselves were built by the Amirail division of Aircraft Mechanics Inc. Cesar Vergara, head of car design at Amtrak in the 1990s, criticized the choice to copy the airliner aesthetic: Amfleet I cars can be identified by having vestibules at both ends of the cars; Amfleet II cars have a single vestibule. The Amfleet I has chemical flush toilets, while the Amfleet II has retention toilets. All Amfleet cars have trapdoors, permitting their use at both high- and low-level platforms. The distance from the rail to the bottom step is ; to the floor level is . = Coaches = Interior of an Amfleet I coach on the Northeast Regional in 2019. Budd built 361 Amfleet I coaches; 90 were configured for long-distance use (60 seats) and 271 for short-distance use (84 seats). All 125 Amfleet II coaches were designed for long-distance service and contained 59 seats. In all standard Amfleet coaches seating is 2×2; in the Amfleet II a single accessible seat accounted for the odd number. Amfleet seats have swing-down tray-tables for at-seat food service, as well as overhead and underseat luggage storage. There are two restrooms at one end of the car. There is a baggage rack at the end of the car. On some cars these have been replaced with a bicycle rack. Under the Capstone refurbishment program most Amfleet I short-distance coaches had three rows of seats removed, reducing their total capacity from 84 to 72 seats. During the 1980s most of the Amfleet I long-distance coaches were refurbished for use on the premium Metroliner service on the Northeast Corridor. All have since been rebuilt, either as 62-seat business class cars or 72-seat short-distance cars. = Cafes = Budd built 54 Amfleet I \\"Amcafe\\" cars and 37 Amfleet I \\"Amdinette\\" cars. The cafes had a snack bar in the middle of the car and 53 coach seats; the dinettes had eight booths and 23 coach seats. Each cafe weighed . The Amcafe design was unpopular and Amtrak rebuilt the cafes into numerous configurations during the 1980s and 1990s. These included all-table dinettes, club cars for use in Metroliner service, and club-dinettes with a mix of tables and club seats. By the 2010s most cafes were configured as club- dinettes; some had been converted into all-table dinettes. Five dinettes were rebuilt for use on the Inter-American, a long-distance train operating between Texas and St. Louis; lounge seats replaced the coach seats. 21 dinettes were also refurbished for Metroliner service. By the 2010s all the remaining dinettes were rebuilt with all-table seating, save two which were converted into short-distance coaches. = Club cars = Budd built 40 Amfleet I \\"Amclub\\" club cars, similar to traditional parlor cars. These cars had a snack bar in the center, 18 club seats in a 2×1 configuration, and 23 coach seats. These cars provided first class service on select trains. Amtrak later referred to these as \\"split\\" Amclubs; club cars rebuilt with all-club style seating were called \\"full\\" Amclubs. None of the Amclubs remain in their original configuration. Three of the original club cars were delivered with all club-style seating for a total of 33 seats; five of the original style were rebuilt to match. As the original Metroliners were withdrawn many of the Amclubs were refurbished for use in Metroliner service. Three were rebuilt for use on the Montrealer; booths and lounge seating replaced the coach seating and club seats. These were later rebuilt as all-table dinettes. Most clubs were rebuilt as club-dinette cars, with one half given over to booths and the other having 2×1 seating. Others were rebuilt as full-length business class cars, with 62 seats. Still others were converted to 72-seat coaches. = Lounges = Budd built 25 Amfleet II \\"Amlounge\\" lounge cars. They differed from other food-service cars in that the snack-bar was off-center. On the shorter side were 27 seats in varying configurations; the longer side had ten four-seat booths. Amtrak rebuilt 14 of them as smoking lounges between 1998–2000: in the short end an enclosed lounge replaced the seating area. All 25 cars were rebuilt as diner-lite cars between 2006–2010. In this configuration the short end has 19 seats, arranged in booths; the long end has seven booths and a conductor's office. The Amfleet II lounge weighed . = Sleeping cars = In the late 1970s Amtrak converted two Amfleet I coaches into sleepers ( 22900 and 22901). Two prototype Superliner roomette modules were installed, displacing twelve seats. The cars were used on the Washington, D.C.—Cincinnati, Ohio Shenandoah. Regular sleepers returned to the Shenandoah in 1979 and the two coaches were returned to a standard configuration. These conversions were termed \\"Ampad.\\"  See also  * Budd SPV-2000: a self- propelled diesel multiple unit using the Amfleet shell  Notes  References        External links * Amfleet roster at On Track On Line * New Amfleet II Railcars brochure * Amfleet I Interior Refresh Program Category:Amtrak rolling stock Category:Budd Company Category:Rail passenger cars of the United States Category:Train-related introductions in 1975 ","title":"Amfleet"},{"id":"2496263","title":"2300 Jackson Street"},{"id":"2496267","text":"Stretton is a southern suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Stretton had a population of 4,334 people.  Geography  Stretton is from the Brisbane Central Business District, and borders the suburbs of Calamvale, Sunnybank Hills, Karawatha, Kuraby, and Drewvale. The northern part of Stretton includes several hills, but the land flattens out towards the south. The southern part has more vegetation, as it joins Karawatha Forest to the south-east and the Calamvale Creek wetlands on the south-west.  History  In the early 19th century, the area and many of today's suburbs around the Sunnybank area were part of a vast area known as Coopers Plains. In 1861, Governor Bowen declared a wide area that included Eight Mile Plains to Stretton as a Brisbane Agricultural Reserve. This agricultural reserve was originally used as a source of timber, but when it was found to be good farming land, settlers quickly turned it into farms that produced sought-after fruit, vegetables, and poultry. A military map from 1922 shows only four houses in the area that is now Stretton. Stretton was gazetted as a suburb of Brisbane in 1972, and was named after George Stretton, a settler, postmaster and hotelier at Browns Plains in the 1870s. Stretton State College opened on 1 January 2006. In the , Stretton had a population of 4,334 people.  Population  More than 65 per cent of households in Stretton are couples with children; 22 per cent are couples without children, and 10 per cent are single-parent households. In 1989 there was controversy regarding the sale of land to Asian investors, and there is a large Asian population in the suburb today. With rare exceptions, the dwellings in Stretton are stand-alone houses -- generally modern, brick and tile. Houses in the north-west corner of Stretton include many huge, multi-storey mansions. Demographics In the , the population of Stretton was 4,067: 51.5% female and 48.5% male. The median age of the Stretton population was 36 years, 1 year below the Australian median. 41.6% of people living in Stretton were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were China 7.1%, Taiwan 7%, New Zealand 4.1%, Hong Kong 4%, India 3.1%. 41.4% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 16.2% Mandarin, 11.3% Cantonese, 3.3% Vietnamese, 2.9% Hindi, 2.4% Korean. In the , the median weekly household income in Stretton was $1,843, compared to the national median of $1,234. This difference is also reflected in real estate, with the median mortgage payment being $2400 per month, compared to the national median of $1,800.  Education  Stretton State College is a government primary and secondary (Prep-12) school for boys and girls at 226 Illaweena Street (). In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 2590 students with 196 teachers (180 full-time equivalent) and 101 non-teaching staff (71 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program.  Facilities  Stretton is home to Hope Christian Assembly, a multicultural Pentecostal Church affiliated with Australian Christian Churches which holds services at Stretton State College.

If the sectors are from the same physical cell site (a sectorised site), it is referred to as softer handoff. This technique is a form of mobile-assisted handover, for IS-95/CDMA2000 CDMA cell phones continuously make power measurements of a list of neighboring cell sites, and determine whether or not to request or end soft handover with the cell sectors on the list. Due to the properties of the CDMA signaling scheme, it is possible for a CDMA phone to simultaneously receive signals from two or more radio base stations that are transmitting the same bit stream (using different transmission codes) on the different physical channels in the same frequency bandwidth. If the signal power from two or more radio base stations is nearly the same, the phone receiver can combine the received signals in such a way that the bit stream is decoded much more reliably than if only one base station were transmitting to the subscriber station. If any one of these signals fades significantly, there will be a relatively high probability of having adequate signal strength from one of the other radio base stations. On the uplink (phone-to-cell-site), all the cell site sectors that are actively supporting a call in soft handover send the bit stream that they receive back to the Radio Network Controller (RNC), along with information about the quality of the received bits. The RNC examines the quality of all these bit streams and dynamically chooses the bit stream with the highest quality. Again, if the signal degrades rapidly, the chance is still good that a strong signal will be available at one of the other cell sectors that is supporting the call in soft handover. Soft handover results in a diversity gain Vanghi,Damnjanovic,Vojcic,The Cdma2000 System for Mobile Communications , Prentice Hall,2004, Ch. 1 called soft handover gain.

Situated in what was then rural Surrey, it lay upstream and on the opposite bank from the Palace of Westminster, which was located nine miles (14 km) to the north-east. It was erected about 1501 by Henry VII of England, formerly known as the Earl of Richmond, in honour of which the manor of Sheen had recently been renamed \\"Richmond\\". Richmond Palace therefore replaced Shene Palace, the latter palace being itself built on the site of an earlier manor house which had been appropriated by Edward I in 1299 and which was subsequently used by his next three direct descendants before it fell into disrepair. In 1500, a year before the construction of the new Richmond Palace began, the name of the town of Sheen, which had grown up around the royal manor, was changed to \\"Richmond\\" by command of Henry VII.\\"Richmond\\", in Encyclopædia Britannica, (9th edition, 1881), s.v. However, both names, Sheen and Richmond, continue to be used, not without scope for confusion. Curiously, today's districts of East Sheen and North Sheen, now under the administrative control of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, were never in ancient times within the manor of Sheen, but were rather developed during the 19th and 20th centuries in parts of the adjoining manor and parish of Mortlake. Richmond remained part of the County of Surrey until the mid-1960s, when it was absorbed by the expansion of Greater London. Richmond Palace was a favourite home of Queen Elizabeth, who died there in 1603. It remained a residence of the kings and queens of England until the death of Charles I in 1649. Within months of his execution, the Palace was surveyed by order of Parliament and was sold for £13,000. Over the following ten years it was largely demolished, the stones and timbers being re-used as building materials elsewhere. Only vestigial traces now survive, notably the Gate House. (51°27'40.52\\"N 0°18'32.53\\"W). The site of the former palace is the area between Richmond Green and the River Thames, and some local street names provide clues to existence of the former Palace, including Old Palace Lane and Old Palace Yard.

The outbuilding with pointed roof to the rear left (north) is the Great Kitchen. The chapel-like building adjoining the palace at the north (left) is the Great Hall =Norman= Henry I divided the manor of Shene from the royal manor of Kingston and granted it to a Norman knight.\\"The mediaeval palace\\", London Borough of Richmond upon Thames The manor-house of Sheen was established by at least 1125. =1299 to 1495= In 1299 Edward I took his whole court to the manor-house at Sheen, close by the river side. In 1305, he received at Sheen the Commissioners from Scotland to arrange the Scottish civil government.'Parishes: Richmond (anciently Sheen)', in A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3, ed. H E Malden (London, 1911), pp. 533-546. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/surrey/vol3/pp533-546 [accessed 19 July 2020]. It returned to royal hands in the reign of Edward II and after his deposition it was held by his wife, Queen Isabella. When the boy-king Edward III came to the throne in 1327 he gave the manor to his mother Isabella. After her death he extended and embellished the manor house and turned it into the first Shene Palace. Edward III died at Shene on 21 June 1377. In 1368 Geoffrey Chaucer served as a yeoman at Sheen. Richard II was the first English king to make Sheen his main residence in 1383. He took his bride Anne of Bohemia there. Twelve years later Richard was so distraught at the death of Anne at the age of 28, that he, according to Holinshed, \\"caused it [the manor] to be thrown down and defaced; whereas the former kings of this land, being wearied of the citie, used customarily thither to resort as to a place of pleasure, and serving highly to their recreation.\\" For almost 20 years it lay in ruins until Henry V undertook rebuilding work in 1414. The first, pre-Tudor, version of the palace was known as Sheen Palace. It was positioned roughly at , in what is now the garden of Trumpeters' House, between Richmond Green and the River. In 1414 Henry V also founded a Carthusian monastery there known as Sheen Priory, adjacent on the N. to the royal residence. Henry VI continued the rebuilding in order that the palace might be worthy of the reception of his queen, Margaret of Anjou. Edward IV granted it to his queen for life. =Tudor=Henry VII, builder of Richmond Palace Sir Thomas Wriothesley (d.1534), who wrote an account of the proceedings. BL Add.MS.45131, f.54 In 1492, a great tournament was held at the Palace by Henry VII. On 23 December 1497 a fire destroyed most of the wooden buildings. Henry rebuilt it and named the new palace \\"Richmond\\" Palace after his title of Earl of Richmond. The earldom was seated at Richmond Castle, Yorkshire, from which it took its name. In 1502, the new palace witnessed the betrothal of Princess Margaret, daughter of Henry VII, to King James IV of Scotland. From this line eventually came the House of Stuart. In 1509 Henry VII died at Richmond Palace. The fire of 1497 At Christmastide 1497 a great fire broke out in the king's private chambers, destroying a large portion of the palace. The Milanese ambassador, Raimondo Soncino, witnessed the blaze, and estimated the damage at 60,000 ducats, in modern money about $10 million or approximately £7 million. The fire lasted three hours and tore through the rest of the palace, causing panic and hundreds to flee. Hammerbeam roofs of the Middle Ages were a structural necessity as much as they were pretty architecture as they kept the heavy timbered roofs from caving in; they were the carpenter's equivalent of the stone vaulting found in Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages because as in famous examples, like Westminster Hall, they allowed the architect greater ability to achieve higher heights with thinner walls and evenly distributed the lateral weight. In as large a fire as described by Soncino the English oak beams of the great hall, a centrepiece of a royal Christmas, would have stood no chance of remaining upright and intact. They would have been engulfed in flames in the high temperatures well exceeding 270 °C. Much of the tapestry work of earlier ages was burnt to cinders, and losses included crown jewels and much of the royal wardrobe including a large amount of cloth of gold, at this time a luxury item only wearable by royalty and in the case of Sheen Palace it was a feature of the bedding. Accounts refer to Henry Tudor, his mother, Margaret Beaufort, and his wife, Queen Elizabeth, running for their lives, with the king barely making it out in time: one of the corridors nearly collapsed on top of him. As it was the time of the Christmas revels, also present during the disaster were all but one of the royal children, and all under the age of 10: Margaret, Mary, and a six-year-old Henry VIII, each of them described as being hurried out in the arms of their nursemaids. For Queen Elizabeth, this would have been a horrible blow: records show that as a child in the 1470s this was where she spent much of her childhood and otherwise this palace would have had strong associations with her mother Elizabeth Woodville: Edward IV left Sheen to his wife in his will. Soncino reports all of the events outlined above, and also states in his accounts that the king \\"does not attach much importance to this loss. He purposes to build the chapel all in stone, and much finer than before.\\" The new Richmond Palace Construction on the new palace began in 1498. Henry named his creation Richmond Palace, in honour of the title he held before acceding to the throne and the title he inherited from his father: Earl of Richmond. Though the palace did not survive the English Civil War, fragments of the edifice still remain along the bank of the Thames, as does Richmond Park, originally a royal hunting reserve that Henry Tudor and all members of the Tudors and early Stuarts used for their personal entertainment. Henry Tudor built a large and grand palace that became the centre of royal life for many years to come, a very important centre of the court of each Tudor monarch and James I. Drawings and descriptions of the palace survive as does the documentation of a 1970s excavation of the grounds, thus posterity has a fairly accurate idea of what the contents and features of the building were. Richmond Palace was largely a building of brick and white stone in the latest styles of the times, with geometric octagonal towers, pepper-pot chimney caps, and ornate weathervanes made of brass. Though it retained the layout of Sheen Palace, new additions that would mark the Renaissance were to be found in this palace, for example, long galleries to display sculpture and portraiture. The windows were panelled, built to bring in more light than the tiny slit-like windows of a castle, built for defence. From its earliest it had inner courtyards designed for leisure, with several portions built for the royal family overlooking a large green. Richmond Palace covered ten acres of land and was large and well appointed enough to have its own orchards and walled gardens. It is known that Henry Tudor decorated his home with many gifts he accepted from Italian bankers in Venice, and the evidence for this and the other accoutrements survives in a 17th-century inventory taken of the palace that is now located in the British National Archives. The inventory also describes new tapestries he commissioned to replace the ones lost in the fire. Henry VIII Later the same year, Henry VIII celebrated Christmas to Twelfth Night at Richmond with the first of his six wives, Catherine of Aragon. During those celebrations, says Mrs. A. T. Thomson, in her Memoirs of the Court of Henry the Eighth: > On the night of the Epiphany (1510), a pageant was introduced into the hall > at Richmond, representing a hill studded with gold and precious stones, and > having on its summit a tree of gold, from which hung roses and pomegranates. > From the declivity of the hill descended a lady richly attired, who, with > the gentlemen, or, as they were then called, children of honour, danced a > morris before the king. On another occasion, in the presence of the court, > an artificial forest was drawn in by a lion and an antelope, the hides of > which were richly embroidered with golden ornaments; the animals were > harnessed with chains of gold, and on each sat a fair damsel in gay apparel. > In the midst of the forest, which was thus introduced, appeared a gilded > tower, at the end of which stood a youth, holding in his hands a garland of > roses, as the prize of valour in a tournament which succeeded the pageant!\\" Henry's son, christened Henry, was born there on New Year's Day, 1511, but died on 22 February. Some years later, the king received a present of Hampton Court from Wolsey, and in return the cardinal received permission to reside at the royal manor of Richmond, where he kept up so much state as to increase the growing ill-feeling against him. When he fell into disfavour he took up his residence at the Lodge in the 'great' park, and subsequently moved to the Priory. In 1533 Richmond became the principal residence of Henry's daughter Mary after she was evicted from her previous residence of Beaulieu. Mary stayed at the palace until December of that year when she was ordered to Hatfield House to wait on the newly born Princess Elizabeth. In 1540 Henry gave the palace to his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves, as part of her annulment settlement. Mary I Reconstruction of Richmond Palace privy apartments. In 1554 Queen Mary I married Philip II of Spain. Forty-five years after her mother Catherine of Aragon had spent Christmas at Richmond Palace, they spent their honeymoon there (and at Hampton Court). Later that same year, her sister Elizabeth was taken to Richmond as a prisoner on her way to Woodstock. Elizabeth I Once Elizabeth became queen she spent much of her time at Richmond, as she enjoyed hunting stags in the \\"Newe Parke of Richmonde\\" (now the Old Deer Park). Elizabeth died there on 24 March 1603. =Stuart=James I King James I preferred the Palace of Westminster to Richmond, but his eldest son Prince Henry was able to commission water-works for the garden designed by the French Huguenot, Salomon de Caus, and the Florentine Costantino de' Servi, shortly before his death in 1612.Colvin, Howard, ed., History of the King's Works, vol. 3 part 1, HMSO (1975), pp. 124-6 Before he became king, Charles I owned Richmond Palace and started to build his art collection whilst living there. Like Elizabeth, James enjoyed hunting stags, and in 1637 created a new area for this now known as Richmond Park, renaming Elizabeth's \\"Newe Parke\\" the \\"Old Deer Park\\". There continue to be red deer in Richmond Park today, possibly descendants of the original herd, free from hunting and relatively tame. Charles I and Commonwealth William Chambers in 1765. This plan was not taken up by the King. A new palace was started on a different design, but was not completed. The king gave the palace with the manor to Queen Henrietta Maria, probably in 1626, and it became the home of the royal children. Within months of the execution of Charles I in 1649, Richmond Palace was surveyed by order of Parliament to see what it could fetch in terms of raw materials, and was sold for £13,000. Over the next ten years it was largely demolished, the stones being re-used as building materials. Restoration of the monarchy Following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, the Palace and manor were restored to Queen Henrietta Maria (d.1669), the mother of King Charles II and widow of the beheaded King Charles I, who during the Civil War had lived in exile in France. It was then in a dismantled condition, having suffered much dilapidation during the inter-regnum. The ruined palace was never rebuilt. Architecture and internal decoration All the accounts which have come down to us describe the furniture and decorations of Richmond Palace as superb, exhibiting in tapestries the deeds of kings and heroes. =Survey of 1649= The survey taken in 1649 affords a minute description of the palace. The great hall was in length, and in breadth, having a screen at the lower end, over which was \\"fayr foot space in the higher end thereof, the pavement of square tile, well lighted and seated; at the north end having a turret, or clock- case, covered with lead, which is a special ornament to this building.\\" The prince's lodgings are described as a \\"freestone building, three stories high, with fourteen turrets covered with lead,\\" being \\"a very graceful ornament to the whole house, and perspicuous to the county round about.\\" A round tower is mentioned, called the \\"Canted Tower,\\" with a staircase of 124 steps. The chapel was long and broad, with cathedral-seats and pews. Adjoining the prince's garden was an open gallery, long, over which was a close gallery of similar length. Here was also a royal library. Three pipes supplied the palace with water, one from the white conduit in the new park, another from the conduit in the town fields, and the third from a conduit near the alms-houses in Richmond. =Archaeology= During 1997 the site was investigated in the Channel 4 programme Time Team which was broadcast in January 1998. =Lavatory innovation= This palace was one of the first buildings in history to be equipped with a flushing lavatory, invented by Elizabeth I's godson, Sir John Harington. Henry VIII had earlier installed flushing latrines at Hampton Court.Thurley, Simon.

HistoryDesign= The park was designed by the EDAW Consortium (including EDAW, Allies and Morrison and Buro Happold), working with Arup and WS Atkins. Detailed landscape architecture was by LDA Design in conjunction with Hargreaves Associates. LDA design contracted Wallace Whittle to carry out various aspects of the M+E Building services design. The NHBC carried out the Sustainability assessments. The park was illuminated with a lighting scheme designed by Speirs + Major. London's Olympic and Paralympic bid proposed that there would be four indoor arenas in the park in addition to the main venues, but the revised master plan published in 2006 reduced this to three, with the volleyball events moved to the Earls Court Exhibition Centre. The fencing arena was also cancelled, with the fencing events taking place at ExCeL London. The remaining indoor arenas are the Basketball Arena and the Copper Box, in addition to the Water Polo Arena, the Aquatics Centre, and the Velopark.

The landscape planning includes the opening up of the River Lea in the northern section of the park, the habitat-creation strategy and the park's excellent links with its hinterland. The landscape design is dominated by vast pedestrian concourses which will be busy during events but will resemble unused airport runways on every other occasion.

Due to the then uncertainty over the future use of the stadium, this bid was withdrawn, with instead a subsequent bid for the 2017 World Championships submitted instead. The success of this bid was announced on 13 November 2011. * The men's and women's 2015 European hockey championships took place at the revamped Lee Valley Hockey Centre.England To Host 2015 European Hockey Championships at Olympic Park Inside the Games, 21 March 2012 * London was announced as the only formal bidder for the 2017 World Paralympic Championships in October 2012.Olympic Stadium set to host 2017 World Paralympic Championships.

On 11 February 2011, West Ham United were selected as preferred bidders, ahead of Tottenham Hotspur, to take over the Olympic Stadium as a football venue after the end of the games. However, five days later Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn announced that he would be challenging the decision to allow West Ham to relocate to the stadium, as he believed that having West Ham playing within of their Brisbane Road stadium could cost Orient support and even their existence. Incidentally, Hearn had expressed interest some years earlier in moving Orient to Olympic Park and reducing its capacity to 25,000 seats, while West Ham would cut the capacity to 60,000 if their relocation went ahead. Tottenham Hotspur also pursued legal action over the decision and eventually the deal with West Ham collapsed due to legal pressure on 11 October 2011. West Ham did go on to win the later tenancy bid and began using the stadium from the start of the 2016–17 football season as the main tenant. The Copper Box was the only permanent indoor arena remaining after the end of London 2012. Built primarily for use in the handball and goalball competitions, it was converted to a multi-use venue that will include use for basketball. As a result of the owners of the Prestige Homes Arena in Milton Keynes terminating their lease, the London Lions basketball club, after a season at the National Sports Centre, Selhurst, relocated to the Copper Box for the 2013-14 BBL season.

Location The village lies along the A6 road and the West Coast Main Line, and is near to the M6 motorway. It is situated from Penrith and about from Kendal. Shap is on the route of the Coast to Coast Walk. Etymology Early (12th and 13th century) forms such as Hep and Yheppe point to an Old Norse rendering Hjáp of an Old English original Hēap = \\"heap\\", (of stones), probably referring to an ancient stone circle, cairn, or to the Shap Stone Avenue just to the west of the village. History Although Shap is geographically a small village, it is legally a market town with a charter dating from the 17th century. The parish was, between 1905 and 1935, administered by an urban district council. At one time, the granite works (which are situated about a mile outside the village) was in itself a separate community, with its own Co- op. Shap polished pink granite can be found in many buildings in the UK, including outside St Paul’s Cathedral in London Shap today St. Michael's Church The village has three pubs, a small supermarket, a fish and chip shop, an antique book shop, a butcher's shop, a primary school, a newsagent's, a coffee shop, a ceramic art studio called Edge Ceramics, a fire station, a shoe shop (New Balance factory shop) an Anglican church and 3 B&B;/ Hostels. There is also a small library, this is in the process of being relinquished from local council control and being adopted by the community as part of a budget cutting measure. Major employers in the area are Hanson and Tata Steel. Some of the scenes in the feature film Withnail and I were filmed around Shap. Sleddale Hall, the filming location for Uncle Monty's cottage Crow Crag, is located near Wet Sleddale Reservoir. On 22 October 1999, a Hawk jet from RAF Leeming crashed into an empty barn in the village before disintegrating across the A6 and West Coast railway line, killing its two-man crew. Attractions Shap Summit Shap Summit is located on the motorway at and the railway at . Shap Fell used to be notorious for the difficult and dangerous stretch of A6 for drivers, and it includes a well-known section of the West Coast Main Line. It has a 1:75 gradient for trains heading north, and in the days of steam locomotives banking engines from Tebay were often used to assist trains. It has been popular with railway photographers and there have been many pictures published taken in the area, most notably at Scout Green which lies on the southern approach to the hill. Shap Fell is known for Shap granite that is a pink rock rich in orthoclase, quartz and biotite; Shap Pink Quarry takes its name from this. Shap Abbey is nearby in the secluded valley of the river Lowther. Impressive ruins dating from 1199. The Abbey was one of the last to be dissolved by Henry VIII in 1540. Shap Wells has a mineral spa located in the grounds of the Shap Wells hotel which was used in World War II as a prisoner of war camp. In literature A scene in Robert Neill's historical novel Crown and Mitre is laid in Shap. In 1659 the book's protagonist Hal Burnaby, a young Royalist, rides through the village on a clandestine mission connected with the restoration of King Charles II. Shap also appears in Anthony Trollope's novel Can You Forgive Her? as the nearest village to Vavasor Hall, the ancestral home of the heroine Alice Vavasor. Governance The civil parish of Shap (formerly Shap Urban Parish) includes the hamlet of Keld and parts of the granite works and limestone works, and has a population of 1,221,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Eden Retrieved 21 November 2009 increasing to 1,264 at the 2011 Census. The parish shares a joint parish council and an electoral ward with Shap Rural. The total population of the electoral ward taken at the 2011 census was 1,394. Shap is in the parliamentary constituency of Penrith and the Border. Neil Hudson was elected its Conservative Member of Parliament at the 2019 General Election, replacing Rory Stewart. Prior to Brexit, for the European Parliament its residents voted to elect MEP's for the North West England constituency. For Local Government purposes it is in the Shap Ward of Eden District Council and the Eden Lakes Division of Cumbria County Council. Shap has its own parish council; Shap Parish Council. Transport The Lancaster and Carlisle Railway (now part of the West Coast Main Line), opened on 17 December 1846, and runs along the eastern edge of the village. Shap railway station was closed in 1968, though there have been calls for its re-opening. Penrith is the closest railway station and is situated on the West Coast Main Line.  Dialect  The people of Shap speak a variant of the Penrithian dialect, which is itself a variant of the Cumbrian dialect spoken around the Penrith and Eden district area.

It was the summer residence of Prince William Henry Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (1743–1805), fourth son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and brother of King George III. During his recovery from porphyria in 1789, George III spent some time convalescing there. The king occupied the right-hand part of the building, and had use of the garden, where the later, left wing stands. His doctors encouraged him to visit the resort to benefit from the sea air and salt water. The patronage of the king was important in drawing fashionable society to the south coast town. Having been a hotel for most of the 20th century, the building then became a private residence, having been renamed Gloucester Lodge after conversion into flats. The lower ground floor contains a pub and restaurant that was known as the Cork and Bottle, but has now changed names and is called The Gloucester. The building Gloucester House is a Grade II* listed building, having been added to the register on 12 December 1953. The house was built in about 1780 and a major extension was added on the south side in 1850. A fire destroyed much of the interior and it was refurbished in 1927. The whole building has a double mansard roof with a valley in the centre. The original building occupying the right side of the range was built as an eight-bay two storey house but now has three storeys, with two levels of attics and a basement. The centre four bays are slightly recessed and the main doorway is in bay 6, with a pedimented portico and flight of steps up from the pavement. There is a range of six recessed, sashed dormer windows at parapet level. The other two storeys also have sashed windows, those on the upper floor with twelve panes and those on the lower one six panes. The more modern range to the south was added in 1850 and has three storeys, attic and basement. The esplanade front has six dormer windows with segmented roofs, the floors underneath having sash windows with stone surrounds. There is a large projecting balcony at ground level. The verandah is supported by cast iron columns rising from the basement, the part of the building now occupied by the Cork and Bottle Public house.

The situation has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitalism, 'minimal statism' and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocated by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of the words 'libertarian' and 'libertarianism'. It has therefore now become necessary to distinguish between their right libertarianism and the left libertarianism of the anarchist tradition.\\"Marshall, Peter (2008).

The term originally denoted a person who upheld the doctrine of the freedom of the will; in this sense, Godwin was not a 'libertarian', but a 'necessitarian'. It came however to be applied to anyone who approved of liberty in general. In anarchist circles, it was first used by Joseph Déjacque as the title of his anarchist journal Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social published in New York in 1858. At the end of the last century, the anarchist Sebastien Faure took up the word, to stress the difference between anarchists and authoritarian socialists.\\"Newman, Saul (2010). The Politics of Postanarchism, Edinburgh University Press. p. 43. . . \\"It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho- capitalism). There is a complex debate within this tradition between those like Robert Nozick, who advocate a 'minimal state', and those like Rothbard who want to do away with the state altogether and allow all transactions to be governed by the market alone. From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions—the minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions—neglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a laissez-faire 'free' market. [...] Anarchism, therefore, has no truck with this right-wing libertarianism, not only because it neglects economic inequality and domination, but also because in practice (and theory) it is highly inconsistent and contradictory. The individual freedom invoked by right-wing libertarians is only a narrow economic freedom within the constraints of a capitalist market, which, as anarchists show, is no freedom at all.\\"Miller, Wilbur R.

Left-libertarianism represents several related yet distinct approaches to political and social theory. In its classical usage, it refers to anti-authoritarian varieties of left-wing politics such as anarchism, especially social anarchism, whose adherents simply call it libertarianism. In the United States, it represents the left-wing of the libertarian movement and the political positions associated with academic philosophers Hillel Steiner, Philippe Van Parijs and Peter Vallentyne that combine self-ownership with an egalitarian approach to natural resources.Kymlicka, Will (2005). \\"libertarianism, left-\\". In Honderich, Ted. The Oxford Companion to Philosophy. New York City: Oxford University Press. p. 516. \\"'Left-libertarianism' is a new term for an old conception of justice, dating back to Grotius. It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premiss that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property. Historic proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and Henry George. Recent exponents include Philippe Van Parijs and Hillel Steiner.\\" . This is done to distinguish libertarian views on the nature of property and capital, usually along left–right or socialist–capitalist lines. While maintaining full respect for personal property, left-libertarians are either compliant, skeptical, or opposed to capitalism and the private ownership of the means of production.Carlson, Jennifer D. (2012). \\"Libertarianism\\". In Miller, Wilbur R. The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia. SAGE Publications. p. 1006. \\"[S]ocialist libertarians view any concentration of power into the hands of a few (whether politically or economically) as antithetical to freedom and thus advocate for the simultaneous abolition of both government and capitalism\\". Other left-libertarians are skeptical of, or fully against, private ownership of natural resources, arguing in contrast to right- libertarians that neither claiming nor mixing one's labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights and maintain that natural resources should be held in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively.Carlson, Jennifer D. (2012). \\"Libertarianism\\". In Miller, Wilbur R. The social history of crime and punishment in America. London: SAGE Publications. p. 1007. . \\"Left-libertarians disagree with right-libertarians with respect to property rights, arguing instead that individuals have no inherent right to natural resources. Namely, these resources must be treated as collective property that is made available on an egalitarian basis\\". Those left-libertarians who support private property do so under different property norms and theories such as usufruct,Carson, Kevin (15 June 2014). \\"What is Left-Libertarianism?\\".

Market-oriented left- libertarianism, including Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's mutualism and Samuel Konkin III's agorism, appeals to left-wing concerns such as class, egalitarianism, environmentalism, gender, immigration and sexuality within the paradigm of free-market anti-capitalism. Although libertarianism in the United States has become associated to classical liberalism and minarchism, with right- libertarianism being more known than left-libertarianism, political usage of the term until then was associated exclusively with anti-capitalism, libertarian socialism and social anarchism and in most parts of the world such an association still predominates.Bookchin, Murray; Biehl, Janet (1997).

In a third sense it has > recently come to be applied to a position combining individual self- > ownership with an egalitarian approach to natural resources; most proponents > of this position are not anarchists. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy distinguishes left-libertarianism from right-libertarianism, arguing: > Libertarianism is often thought of as 'right-wing' doctrine.

Terminology  As a term, left-libertarianism is used by some political analysts, academics and media sources, especially in the United States, to contrast it with the libertarian philosophy which is supportive of free-market capitalism and strong private property rights, in addition to supporting limited government and self-ownership which is common to both libertarian types.

Philosophy  While all libertarians begin with a conception of personal autonomy from which they argue in favor of civil liberties and a reduction or elimination of the state, left-libertarianism encompasses those libertarian beliefs that claim the Earth's natural resources belong to everyone in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively. Traditionally, left-libertarian schools are communist and market abolitionist, advocating the eventual replacement of money with labor vouchers or decentralized planning. Contemporary left-libertarians such as Hillel Steiner, Peter Vallentyne, Philippe Van Parijs, Michael Otsuka and David Ellerman believe the appropriation of land must leave \\"enough and as good\\" for others or be taxed by society to compensate for the exclusionary effects of private property. Socialist libertarians such as anarchists (green anarchists, individualist anarchists and social anarchists) and libertarian Marxists (council communists, De Leonists and Luxemburgists) promote usufruct and socialist economic theories, including collectivism, mutualism and syndicalism. They criticize the state for being the defender of private property and believe capitalism entails wage slavery. Joseph Déjacque was the first to formulate libertarian ideas under the term libertarian. Later philosophers on the left would go onto adding detail to his political philosophy to study and document attitudes and themes relating to stateless socialism. In Déjacque's case, it was called libertarian communism. = Personal autonomy = Left-libertarianism such as anarchism envisages freedom as a form of autonomyMarshall, Peter (2009).

These social anarchists emphasize mutual aid whereas individualist anarchists extol individual sovereignty.Marshall, Peter (2009). Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. London: Harper Perennial. pp. 8–10. = Civil liberties = American anarchist Emma Goldman, prominent anarcha- feminist, free love and freethought activist Left-libertarians have been advocates and activists of civil liberties, including free love and free thought. Free love appeared alongside anarcha-feminism and advocacy of LGBT rights. Anarcha-feminism developed as a synthesis of radical feminism and anarchism and views patriarchy as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late-19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Lucy Parsons, Emma Goldman, Voltairine de Cleyre and Virginia Bolten. Advocates of free love viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of individual sovereignty and they particularly stressed women's rights as most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures. Like other radical feminists, anarcha-feminists criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and gender roles. Free Society (1895–1897 as The Firebrand, 1897–1904 as Free Society) was an anarchist newspaper in the United States that staunchly advocated free love and women's rights while criticizing comstockery, the censorship of sexual information.Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902–1909. p. 551. \\"Free Society was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century.\\" Anarcha-feminism has voiced opinions and taken action around certain sex-related subjects such as pornography, BDSM and the sex industry. Free thought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds opinions should be formed on the basis of science, logic and reason in contrast with authority, tradition or other dogmas. In the United States, free thought was an anti-Christian, anti-clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide on religious matters. A number of contributors to Liberty were prominent figures in both free thought and anarchism. Catalan anarchist and free-thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established modern or progressive schools in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. Fiercely anti- clerical, Ferrer believed in \\"freedom in education\\", i.e. education free from the authority of the church and state. The schools' stated goal was to \\"educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting\\". Later in the 20th century, Austrian Freudo-Marxist Wilhelm Reich, who coined the term sexual revolution in one of his books from the 1940s,Reich, Wilhelm; Wolfe, Theodore P, trans. (1945). The Sexual Revolution: Toward a Self- governing Character Structure (in German: Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf). Berlin: Sexpol-Verlag (German ed.). New York City: Orgone Institute Press (English ed.). became a consistent propagandist for sexual freedom, going as far as opening free sex-counseling clinics in Vienna for working-class patients (Sex-Pol stood for the German Society of Proletarian Sexual Politics). According to Elizabeth Danto, Reich offered a mixture of \\"psychoanalytic counseling, Marxist advice and contraceptives\\" and \\"argued for sexual expressiveness for all, including the young and the unmarried, with a permissiveness that unsettled both the political left and the psychoanalysts\\". The clinics were immediately overcrowded by people seeking help.Danto, Elizabeth Ann (2007) [2005]. Freud's Free Clinics: Psychoanalysis & Social Justice, 1918–1938. Columbia University Press. pp. 118–120, 137, 198, 208. During the early 1970s, the English anarchist and pacifist Alex Comfort achieved international celebrity for writing the sex manuals The Joy of SexComfort, Alex (1972). The Joy of Sex. Crown. and More Joy of Sex.Comfort, Alex (1973). More Joy of Sex: A Lovemaking Companion to The Joy of Sex. Crown. = State = Many socialist left-libertarians are anarchists and believe the state inherently violates personal autonomy. Anarchists believe the state defends private property which they view as intrinsically harmful as this strongly prevents removal of illegitimate authority through inspection and vigilance. Robert Paul Wolff has argued that \\"since 'the state is authority, the right to rule', anarchism which rejects the State is the only political doctrine consistent with autonomy in which the individual alone is the judge of his moral constraints\\". Market-oriented left-libertarians argue that so- called free markets actually consist of economic privileges granted by the state. These left-libertarians advocate for free markets, termed freed markets, that are freed from these privileges. They see themselves part of the free-market tradition of socialism.Chartier, Gary.

It has been argued that socialist values are incompatible with the concept of self-ownership, when this concept is considered \\"the core feature of libertarianism\\" and socialism is defined as holding \\"that we are social beings, that society should be organised, and individuals should act, so as to promote the common good, that we should strive to achieve social equality and promote democracy, community and solidarity\\". However, it has also been argued that \\"property rights [...] do not pass judgment as to what rights individuals have to their own person [...] [and] to the external world\\" and that \\"the nineteenth-century egalitarian libertarians were not misguided in thinking that a thoroughly libertarian form of communism is possible at the level of principle\\". = Economics = Left-libertarians like anarchists, libertarian Marxists and market-oriented left-libertarians argue in favor of libertarian socialist economic theories such as collectivism, communism, mutualism and syndicalism. Daniel Guérin wrote that \\"anarchism is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State\\".Guérin, Daniel (1970). Anarchism: From Theory to Practice. New York City: Monthly Review Press. p. 12. .  Schools of thought  Anarchism = Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies characterized by self-governed, non-hierarchical, voluntary institutions. It developed in the 19th century from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.(2006). \\"Anarchism\\". Encarta Online Encyclopedia. William Godwin, who has been described as an early philosophical anarchist As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s and in the wake of the French Revolution, William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.Everhart, Robert B. (1982). The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research. p. 115. According to anarchist Peter Kropotkin, Godwin was \\"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work\\".Peter Kropotkin, \\"Anarchism\\", Encyclopædia Britannica 1910. Godwin instead attached his ideas to an early Edmund Burke.Godwin, William (1793). Political Justice. \\"Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in [Edmund] Burke's Vindication of Natural Society; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence\\". He is generally regarded as the founder of philosophical anarchism, arguing in Political Justice that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance.Adams, Ian (2001). Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press. p. 116. Godwin thought the proliferation of reason would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power, rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution. His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage as a manifestation of the people's \\"mental enslavement\\". He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the first self-described anarchist In France, revolutionaries began using anarchiste in a positive light as early as September 1793.Sheehan, Sean (2004). Anarchism. London. Reaktion Books Ltd. p. 85. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the first self-proclaimed anarchist (a label he adopted in his treatise What Is Property?) and is often described as the founder of modern anarchist theory.Guérin, Daniel (1970). Anarchism: From Theory to Practice. New York: Monthly Review Press. He developed the theory of spontaneous order in society in which organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests, saying: \\"Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order\\". Proudhon answers his own question in What Is Property? with the famous statement that \\"property is theft\\". He opposed the institution of decreed property (\\"proprietorship\\") in which owners have complete rights to \\"use and abuse\\" their property as they wishProudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1840). What Is Property? \\"Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property\\". and contrasted this with usufruct (\\"possession\\") or limited ownership of resources only while in more or less continuous use. Proudhon wrote that \\"Property is Liberty\\" because it was a bulwark against state power.Edwards, Stewart (1969). \\"Introduction\\". In Selected Writings of Pierre- Joseph Proudhon. Anchor Books, Doubleday & Company, Inc. p. 33. Proudhon's opposition to the state, organized religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time. However, French anarchist Joseph Déjacque castigated Proudhon for his sexist economic and political views in a scathing letter written in 1857.Joseph Déjacque, \\"De l'être-humain mâle et femelle–Lettre à P.J. Proudhon\\" (1857).Marshall, Peter (2009). Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. Oakland, Oakland, CA. PM Press. p. 641. \\"The word 'libertarian' has long been associated with anarchism, and has been used repeatedly throughout this work. The term originally denoted a person who upheld the doctrine of the freedom of the will; in this sense, Godwin was not a 'libertarian', but a 'necessitarian'. It came however to be applied to anyone who approved of liberty in general. In anarchist circles, it was first used by Joseph Déjacque as the title of his anarchist journal Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social published in New York in 1858. At the end of the last century, the anarchist Sébastien Faure took up the word, to stress the difference between anarchists and authoritarian socialists.\\" He argued that \\"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\\".(21 September 1858). \\"l'Echange\\". In Le Libertaire. 6. New York. Déjacque later named his anarchist publication Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social (Libertarian, Journal of the Social Movement) which was printed from 9 June 1858 to 4 February 1861. In the mid-1890s, French libertarian communist Sébastien Faure began publishing a new Le Libertaire while France's Third Republic enacted the so-called villainous laws (lois scélérates) which banned anarchist publications in France. Libertarianism has frequently been used as a synonym for anarchism since this time, especially in Europe.Colin Ward (2004), Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 62. \\"For a century, anarchists have used the word 'libertarian' as a synonym for 'anarchist', both as a noun and an adjective.

Boston: Small, Maynard & Co. p. 20. an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type and made his own printing plates. Warren was a follower of Robert Owen and joined Owen's community at New Harmony, Indiana. Josiah Warren termed the phrase \\"Cost the limit of price\\", with \\"cost\\" referring not to monetary price paid, but the labor one exerted to produce an item.Warren, Josiah. Equitable Commerce. \\"A watch has a cost and a value. The COST consists of the amount of labor bestowed on the mineral or natural wealth, in converting it into metals [...].\\" Therefore, \\"[h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce\\". He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental \\"labor for labor store\\" called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism (these included Utopia and Modern Times). Warren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews' The Science of Society, published in 1852, was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories. American individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker argued that the elimination of what he called \\"the four monopolies\\"—the land monopoly, the money and banking monopoly, the monopoly powers conferred by patents and the quasi-monopolistic effects of tariffs—would undermine the power of the wealthy and big business, making possible widespread property ownership and higher incomes for ordinary people, while minimizing the power of would-be bosses and achieving socialist goals without state action. Tucker influenced and interacted with anarchist contemporaries—including Lysander Spooner, Voltairine de Cleyre, Dyer Lum and William Batchelder Greene—who have in various ways influenced later left-libertarian thinking.Martin, James J.

For prominent anarcho-syndicalist Rudolf Rocker, \\"[t]he first movement of the Spanish workers was strongly influenced by the ideas of Pi y Margall, leader of the Spanish Federalists and disciple of Proudhon. Pi y Margall was one of the outstanding theorists of his time and had a powerful influence on the development of libertarian ideas in Spain. His political ideas had much in common with those of Richard Price, Joseph Priestly [sic], Thomas Paine, Jefferson, and other representatives of the Anglo-American liberalism of the first period. He wanted to limit the power of the state to a minimum and gradually replace it by a Socialist economic order\\".Rocker, Rudolf (1938). Anarcho-syndicalism: Theory and Practice. Pi i Margall was a dedicated theorist in his own right, especially through book-length works such as La reacción y la revolución (Reaction and Revolution) in 1855, Las nacionalidades (Nationalities) in 1877 and La Federación (Federation) in 1880. In the 1950s, the Old Right and classical liberals in the United States began identifying as libertarians in order to distance themselves from modern liberals and the New Left.Burns, Jennifer (2009).

Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property.\\" Locke argued that natural resources could be appropriated as long as doing so satisfies the proviso that there remains \\"enough, and as good, left in common for others\\".Locke, John (1689). Two Treatises of Government. In this view, unappropriated natural resources are either unowned or owned in common and private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount or the property is taxed to compensate those who are excluded. This position is articulated in contrast to the position of right-libertarians who argue for a characteristically labor-based right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world such as land.Rothbard, Murray (1982).

Henry George proposed the abolition of all taxes except those on land value Economists since Adam Smith have opined that a land value tax would not cause economic inefficiency, despite their fear that other forms of taxation would do so. It would be a progressive tax, i.e. a tax paid primarily by the wealthy, that increases wages, reduces economic inequality, removes incentives to misuse real estate and reduces the vulnerability that economies face from credit and property bubbles.McCluskey, William J, Franzsen, Riël C.

Believing that people ought to own the fruits of their labor and the value of the improvements they make, George was opposed to tariffs, income taxes, sales taxes, poll taxes, property taxes (on improvements) and to any tax on production, consumption or capital wealth. George was among the staunchest defenders of free markets and his book Protection or Free Trade was read into the United States Congressional Record. Early followers of George's philosophy called themselves single taxers because they believed the only economically and morally legitimate, broad-based tax is on land rent.

Walras advocated for a free market economy in which capital, production, and exchange remain in the hands of private actors. However, he also proposed the full socialization of the product of land.

According to Iain McKay, \\"capitalism is marked by the exploitation of labour by capital\\" and \\"the root of this criticism is based, ironically enough, on the capitalist defence of private property as the product of labour.

LewRockwell.com. Retrieved 28 November 2019. Geolibertarians generally advocate distributing the land rent to the community via a land value tax as proposed by Henry George and others before him. For this reason, they are often called single taxers. Fred E. Foldvary coined geo- libertarianism in an article so titled in Land and Liberty.Foldvary, Fred E. (1981). \\"Geo-libertarianism\\". Land and Liberty. pp. 53–55. In the case of geoanarchism, a proposed voluntaryist form of geolibertarianism as described by Foldvary, rent would be collected by private associations with the opportunity to secede from a geocommunity and not receive the geocommunity's services if desired. The political philosopher G. A. Cohen extensively criticized the claim, characteristic of the Georgist school of political economy, that self-ownership and a privilege-free society can be realized simultaneously, also addressing the question of what egalitarian political principles imply for the personal behaviour of those who subscribe to them. In Self-Ownership, Freedom, and Equality, Cohen argued that any system purporting to take equality and its enforcement seriously is not consistent with the full emphasis on self-ownership and negative freedom that defines market libertarian thought. Tom G. Palmer has responded to Cohen's critique.Palmer, Tom G. (1998). \\"The Literature of Liberty\\". In Boaz, David.

Peter Kropotkin provided a scientific explanation of how mutual aid is the real basis for social organization in his Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution. New England transcendentalism (especially Henry David Thoreau and Amos Bronson Alcott) and German Romanticism, the pre-Raphaelites and other back to nature movements combined with anti-war, anti-industrialism, civil liberties and decentralization movements are all part of this tradition. In the modern period, Murray Bookchin and the Institute for Social Ecology elaborated these ideas more systematically. Bookchin was one of the main influences behind the formation of the Alliance 90/The Greens, the first green party to win seats in state and national parliaments. Modern green parties attempt to apply these ideas to a more pragmatic system of democratic governance as opposed to contemporary individualist or socialist libertarianism. The green movement, especially its more left-wing factions, is often described by political scientists as left-libertarian.Kitschelt, Herbert (September 1988). \\"The Life Expectancy of Left-Libertarian Parties.

Political scientists see European political parties such as Ecolo and Groen in Belgium, Alliance 90/The Greens in Germany, or the Green Progressive Accord and GroenLinks in the Netherlands as coming out of the New Left and emphasizing spontaneous self-organisation, participatory democracy, decentralization and voluntarism, being contrasted to the bureaucratic or statist approach. Similarly, political scientist Ariadne Vromen has described the Australian Greens as having a \\"clear left-libertarian ideological base\\". In the United States, green libertarianism is based upon a mixture of political third party values such as the environmentalism of the Green Party and the civil libertarianism of the Libertarian Party.

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.\\"Tucker, Benjamin (1926). Individual Liberty. Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows: \\"They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, – follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism. [... Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\\"Ward, Colin (1966). \\"Anarchism as a Theory of Organization\\". \\"Anarchist historian George Woodcock report of Mikhail Bakunin's anti-authoritarianism and shows opposition to both state and non-state forms of authority as follows: \\"All anarchists deny authority; many of them fight against it.\\" (p. 9) ... \\"Bakunin did not convert the League's central committee to his full program, but he did persuade them to accept a remarkably radical recommendation to the Berne Congress of September 1868, demanding economic equality and implicitly attacking authority in both Church and State.\\" Libertarian socialism opposes both authoritarian and vanguardist Bolshevism/Leninism and reformist Fabianism/social democracy.O'Neil, John (1998).

Beyond post-socialism. Dialogues with the far-left. Palgrave Macmillan. p. 8. \\"In some ways, it is perhaps fair to say that if Left communism is an intellectual- political formation, it is so, first and foremost, negatively – as opposed to other socialist traditions. I have labelled this negative pole 'socialist orthodoxy', composed of both Leninists and social democrats. [... What I suggested was that these Left communist thinkers differentiated their own understandings of communism from a strand of socialism that came to follow a largely electoral road in the West, pursuing a kind of social capitalism, and a path to socialism that predominated in the peripheral and semi- peripheral countries, which sought revolutionary conquest of power and led to something like state capitalism. Generally, the Left communist thinkers were to find these paths locked within the horizons of capitalism (the law of value, money, private property, class, the state), and they were to characterize these solutions as statist, substitutionist and authoritarian.\\" Past and present currents and movements commonly described as libertarian socialist include anarchism (especially anarchist schools of thought such as anarcho-communism, anarcho-syndicalism collectivist anarchism, green anarchism, individualist anarchism,An Anarchist FAQ. \\"(Benjamin) Tucker referred to himself many times as a socialist and considered his philosophy to be \\"Anarchistic socialism.\\"Armand, Émile (1907). \\"Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity\\".

While American market-oriented left-libertarians after Benjamin Tucker tended to ally with the political right (with notable exceptions), relationships between such libertarians and the New Left thrived in the 1960s, laying the groundwork for modern free-market left- libertarianism.

Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement. New York: Public Affairs. p. 338. Working with other radicals such as Karl Hess and Ronald Radosh, Rothbard argued that the consensus view of American economic history, according to which a beneficent government has used its power to counter corporate predation, is fundamentally flawed. Rather, government intervention in the economy has largely benefited established players at the expense of marginalized groups, to the detriment of both liberty and equality. Moreover, the robber baron period, hailed by the right and despised by the left as a heyday of laissez-faire, was not characterized by laissez-faire at all, but it was a time of massive state privilege accorded to capital.On partnerships between the state and big business and the role of big business in promoting regulation, see Kolko, Gabriel (1977).

Scholars representing this school of left-libertarianism often understand their position in contrast to right-libertarians, who maintain that there are no fair share constraints on use or appropriation that individuals have the power to appropriate unowned things by claiming them (usually by mixing their labor with them) and deny any other conditions or considerations are relevant and that there is no justification for the state to redistribute resources to the needy or to overcome market failures. A number of left-libertarians of this school argue for the desirability of some state social welfare programs.Van Parijs, Phillippe (1998).

Neo-libertarianism has its roots at least as far back as 1980, when it was first described by James Sterba of the University of Notre Dame. Sterba observed that libertarianism advocates for a government that does no more than protection against force, fraud, theft, enforcement of contracts and other negative liberties as contrasted with positive liberties by Isaiah Berlin. Sterba contrasted this with the older libertarian ideal of a night watchman state, or minarchism. Sterba held that it is \\"obviously impossible for everyone in society to be guaranteed complete liberty as defined by this ideal: after all, people's actual wants as well as their conceivable wants can come into serious conflict. [...] [I]t is also impossible for everyone in society to be completely free from the interference of other persons\\".Sterba, James (1980). Justice: Alternative Political Perspectives. Boston: Wadsworth Publishing Company. p. 175. . In 2013, Sterna wrote that \\"I shall show that moral commitment to an ideal of 'negative' liberty, which does not lead to a night-watchman state, but instead requires sufficient government to provide each person in society with the relatively high minimum of liberty that persons using Rawls' decision procedure would select.

Definition In terms of taste and attitude in cinema practice, paracinema is similar to camp, and both are conceptually linked to trash and kitsch in the world of cult cinema. The term was first defined by cultural historian Jeffrey Sconce, who described paracinema as 'an extremely elastic textual category'. > In addition to art film, horror, and science fiction films, \\"paracinema\\" > catalogues \\"include entries from such seemingly disparate genres\\" as > badfilm, splatterpunk, mondo films, sword-and-sandal epics, Elvis flicks, > government hygiene films, Japanese monster movies, beach party musicals, and > \\"just about every other historical manifestation of exploitation cinema from > juvenile delinquency documentaries to ... pornography. Paracinema denotes an opposition to mainstream that, unlike other cult genres, specifically attacks the \\"reigning notions of \\"quality\\".\\" Sconce also referred to paracinema as a particular film reading strategy aimed at performing a cultural leveling between the praised high culture and discarded low culture. Structure The term \\"paracinema\\" is also used in the context of avant-garde or experimental film studies to denote works identified by their makers as films but that lack one or more material/mechanical elements of the film medium. Such works began to appear in the 1960s in the wake of Conceptual art's rejection of standard artistic media like painting and embrace of much more ephemeral, transient materials and forms (including concepts themselves, independent of realization in any concrete material form). In exploring the fundamental nature and purpose of their medium, experimental filmmakers in the 1960s and 1970s began to question the necessity of film technology for the creation of cinema, and began making works without film that were nonetheless still considered part of the avant-garde film tradition. Such works include Ken Jacobs's \\"Nervous System\\" works and live shadowplays, the latter made with no film, camera, or projectors, only shadows cast by flickering lights onto a screen. Anthony McCall's \\"solid light\\" films, such as Line Describing a Cone (1973) and Long Film for Ambient Light (1975), are other examples; Long Film for Ambient Light, despite its title, employed no film at all. It consisted simply of an empty artists' space lit over a 24-hour period by sunlight during the day and electric light at night. Tony Conrad's Yellow Movies (1972–1975), rectangular pieces of paper coated with house paint and allowed to turn yellow from exposure over many years, are yet another example of film makers' investigation of the fundamental properties and effects of cinema outside the physical boundaries of the film medium. In many cases, \\"paracinematic\\" works came out of a sense among radical filmmakers that the film medium posed overly restrictive and unnecessary constraints (e.g. material and economic limitations) on their search for new kinds of cinematic experience. \\"Cinema\\", in this context, is understood as a much more varied art form than among most other kinds of filmmakers, who assume that \\"film\\" cannot be disconnected from the film medium.Tony Conrad, \\"Is This Penny Ante or a High Stakes Game?

Over time, successive buildings have served as homes to Sir Thomas Moyle, the Earls of Winchilsea and Nottingham, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, and others. Eastwell Towers The estate is now mainly a farming concern, raising crops and sheep. Part of the estate is landscaped to include a large shallow lake which can be fished and the distinctive Eastwell Towers. The largest building on the site today is Eastwell Manor, a stately home which is now operated as a country house hotel. The Manor and Towers are Grade II listed. Eastwell Manor The original country house at Eastwell was built for Sir Thomas Moyle between 1540 and 1550. One of the men employed on the estate was the bricklayer Richard Plantagenet, who claimed to be an illegitimate son of Richard III. The first house was replaced by one built in the neo-Elizabethan style between 1793–1799 for George Finch-Hatton to designs by Adam’s former draughtsman, Joseph Bonomi (1739-1808). A Victorian Tudor-style wing was later added; the house had seven bays and wings of three bays each. In the mid-1860s, the 11th Earl of Winchilsea experienced serious financial difficulties, which eventually forced him to leave the property. On 4 December 1868 trustees appointed under the Winchilsea Estate Act (1865) entered into a contract to let Eastwell Park, together with its furnishings and effects, to the Duke of Abercorn for a period of five years. Lord Winchilsea had been obliged to vacate the property sometime prior to December 1868,The Duke of Richmond and Another v. Calisher. In The Times, Wednesday 2 February 1870, p. 11. and he was formally adjudged bankrupt on 5 October 1870.Court of Bankruptcy. In Re The Earl Of Winchilsea. In The Times, Thursday 6 October 1870, p. 11. Eastwell was next occupied by Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Queen Victoria. He lived here with his family until 1893, when he inherited the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in Germany. During that time, Queen Victoria was a frequent visitor and there are photographs of her skating on the lake. Prince Alfred's older brother, the future Edward VII, was also a visitor. In 1875, Prince Alfred's daughter Princess Marie - who later became queen of Romania - was born at the house. In her memoirs, she recalls \\"beautiful Eastwell with its great gray house, its magnificent park, with its herds of deer and picturesque Highland cattle, its lake, its woods, its garden with the old cedar tree which was our fairy mansion.\\"Marie, Queen of Rumania, \\"The Story of My Life, Part 2\\", The Saturday Evening Post, 23 December 1933. Copy available here. In 1884, another of Alfred's children, Princess Beatrice - who later married into the Spanish Royal Family - was also born at Eastwell. After the First World War, the Eastwell estate faced the same economic problems that also affected many other English stately homes. In the 1920s the main house was severely damaged by fire. A smaller house in a similar style was built on the same site in 1926-1928. After many changes, Eastwell Manor is now operated as a country house hotel. There is an indoor swimming pool, and a nine-hole golf course has been laid out in the grounds. The rest of the estate is used for farming. Eastwell Towers The distinctive structure now known as Eastwell Towers stands a mile south-south west of the manor. It was the original main gatehouse to Eastwell Park and was built in 1848. Home Farm Home Farm at Eastwell Park was built at a distance from the main stately home. The large residence is surrounded by fields and lies close to the church of St Mary the Virgin. St Mary the Virgin Next to the large shallow lake at Eastwell Park is the ruined church of St Mary the Virgin, which is now cared for by the Friends of Friendless Churches. The church dates to the 14th century but became unused after First World War. A storm in 1951 caused severe damage: parts of the nave and the choir fell down. The tower remains reasonably intact. Marble monuments once found in the church are now on view in the Victoria and Albert Museum. A memorial located in the former choir commemorates the grave of Richard Plantagenet, alleged to be the illegitimate son of Richard III. George Finch-Hatton, 11th Earl of Winchilsea (1815–1887), his second wife Lady Elizabeth Georgiana (d. 1904, daughter of Francis Conyngham, 2nd Marquess Conyngham) as well as his only son George William Finch-Hatton, Viscount Maidstone (1852–1879) are buried in a simple grave in the overgrown part of the church cemetery.

Background  Consisting entirely of self-written demonstration recordings recorded between their formative years of 1957 and 1960 (except for the last track, \\"It's All Over\\", a solo vocal performance from brother Don in 1976), Too Good To Be True is a bringing together of almost entirely completely unreleased recordings (\\"Give Me A Future\\" had already been released in its complete form on the 1992 collection Classic Everly Brothers), the album was the result of a collaboration between Cary Mansfield and Andrew Sandoval, with additional research from Peggy Lamb. Having originally recorded four songs in November 1955 for Columbia, including a third-take, false-started version of the first song they recorded together, \\"The Sun Keeps Shining\\", a cowrite between Don Everly and Jerry Organ (the flip-side of a 45 released in February 1956 on the back of their second-ever recorded song, \\"Keep A'Lovin' Me\\"), all of the songs which appear on this album are original recordings. Amongst these songs are original, previously unheard recordings they made when the brothers signed for Acuff-Rose, and demo tracks of latterly released material such as \\"Should We Tell Him\\" and the original version of \\"I Wonder if I Care as Much\\". As the decade came to a close and official albums such as Songs Our Daddy Taught Us employed tighter harmony singing and the necessity for better- quality playing, the later tracks display a greater sense of rhythm and timing in the original recordings, including The New Album's solo vocal \\"Dancing On My Feet\\", present as a previously recorded demo on this album.

Windlesham Moor is a country house and, for a time in the 20th century a royal residence, at Windlesham in the English county of Surrey. In its capacity as a royal residence, it was, for nearly two years in the late 1940s, the home of the current Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.  History  Mr Philip Hill bought the Victorian home and grounds in a state of disrepair in 1942 for £40,000 (). Later the Royal Family bought the renovated Sunninghill Park house and park from Hill. He renovated the house in 1944. It was rented furnished from his widow, Mrs. Warwick Bryant, for The Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh and The Duke of Edinburgh between 1947 and 4 July 1949. The house has by design four reception rooms including a reception hall, dining room, a drawing room, and a Chinese room. Other room names during the royal tenure included a study, games room, and loggia and five main bedrooms. The nursery comprised two guest rooms joined. The house bore with it , largely of light woodland in the acidic heath of Surrey Heath on the elevated Bagshot Formation (Bagshot sands). =Neighbours= To the north and west is (in Berkshire) part of Swinley Forest lying in the Crown Estate, separated by the Ascot to Guildford Line from its heart. To the south is Erl Wood Manor European research laboratory established in 1967 for Eli Lilly and Company, a USA-based pharmaceutical company. To the south-west corner across the minor train line is a private racecourse and to the east are smallholdings and gardens of detached homes such as Windlesham Hill Farm which is divided into three. A 21st-century care home has been established on part of the former farm.  Present  The current owner is Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum who has invested in vast renovation and extensions, the addition of a large security gatehouse in 2002 and the inclusion of two homes into the estate, \\"Winklands\\" and \\"Rose Cottage\\". The house is enjoyed throughout the summer months (July to September) by its current owner, his family, and other Arab dignitaries and occasionally by the Sheikh's invitees during the remainder of the year. The property is maintained all year round by a team of property managers, gardeners and security personnel. A painting of the house and gardens circa 1934, attributed to Winston Churchill, was discovered and auctioned in September 2008.

He also became minister of state for defence in the cabinet of Feroz Khan Noon. Earlier, he has also served as the minister of state for interior. Bugti had strictly opposed education and development programmes in his area. He was a labelled as a cruel leader by many including people from his own tribe. Thousands of people from his tribe who raised their voice against his autocratic and absolute rule had been driven out of their homes and exiled. The areas which were under the control of Akbar Bugti remained some of the most poor in all of Pakistan and lacked any kind of infrastructure. He was involved in a struggle, at times armed, for greater autonomy for Balochistan. The government of Pakistan accused him of keeping a private militia and leading a guerrilla war against the state. On 26 August 2006, Nawab Akbar Bugti, was killed when his hide-out cave, located in Kohlu, about 150 miles east of Quetta, collapsed. Early life and family Bugti, meeting with Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Nawab Akbar Shahbaz Khan Bugti was born on 12 July 1927 in Barkhan (in present-day Balochistan), the rural home of the Khetran, a Baloch tribe, to which his mother belonged. He was the son of the chief of his tribe, Nawab Mehrab Khan Bugti, and grandson of Sir Shahbaz Khan Bugti. He received his early education from Karachi Grammar School and later from Aitchison College after his father's death. Being the son of the tribe's chief, he became the tumandar (chief) of his tribe after his father. Nawab Akbar Bugti had three wives and thirteen children (6 sons and 7 daughters) altogether. From his first wife:Nawab Saleem Bugti, Talal, Rehan and Salal Bugti. All four of these sons have died. Nawabzada Salal Bugti was murdered in a shootout in Quetta by the rival Bugti Kalpar sub clan in June 1996. From Nawab Akbar Bugti's second wife: Jamil Bugti. And from Nawab Akbar Bugti's third wife: Shahzwar Bugti. Jamil Bugti and Shahzwar Bugti are the surviving sons of Nawab Akbar Bugti. Akbar Bugti had five daughters from his first wife: Durr-e-Shahwar (deceased), Nilofer, Nazli (deceased), Durdana and Dreen. And two from his second wife: Shahnaz Marri (wife of Nawab Khair Bux Marri's relative, Humayun Marri) and Farah Naz Bugti (wife of Bivragh Bugti, the son of Nawabzada Ahmad Nawaz Bugti who was the brother of Nawab Akbar Bugti), who are the sisters of Jamil Bugti. The Bugti grandchildren consist of Nawab Mohammad Mir Aali Bugti (the current Nawab of Bugti Tribe), Shaheed Nawabzada Mohammad Mir Zong Bugti, Shaheed Nawabzada Mohammad Mir Taleh Bugti, Nawabzada Mohammad Mir Zamran Bugti Chairman of P.J.W.P and Nawabzada Mohammad Mir Kohmir Bugti Vice Chairman of P.J.W.P are (son's of Late Nawab Saleem Akbar Khan Bugti), Mir Brahamdagh (son of Rehan Bugti),Mir Shahzain Presedent of J.W.P,Mir Gohram and Mir Chakar (sons of Talal Bugti). Insurgency in Balochistan Balochistan, the largest province of Pakistan, is abundant in natural resources, but due to the absence of proper development and education to the masses, has become one of the poorest regions of the country. This is largely perceived as injustice by the Baloch people, and therefore has led to the Baloch people calling for a greater share of resources and more autonomy. =Increase in tensions in 2005= In 2005, Bugti presented a 15-point agenda to the Pakistan government. Their stated demands included greater control of the province's resources and a moratorium on the construction of military bases. It also included a near 50% share of all the money used in the development of the province. In the meantime, attacks against the Pakistan Army also increased in the area, including a 2005 attack on a helicopter, in which the head of Pakistan's Frontier Corps and his deputy were injured.\\"Pakistan general hurt in attack\\", BBC News, 15 December 2005. In March 2006, a crowded bus carrying a wedding party hit an anti-tank mine in Dera Bugti. The blast resulted in the death of 28 people, mostly women and children, and injured 7 others. Most of the victims belonged to Masoori Bugti tribe which had revolted against Akbar Bugti's rule. Akbar Bugti claimed responsibility for the attack on the bus. Abdul Samad Lasi, a district chief, said that militants under the command of Akbar Bugti had planted hundreds of mines on dirt roads in various parts of Dera Bugti. The aim of planting such mines was to target civilians in the area. Furthermore, he added that Pakistani security forces had neutralized many of these landmines planted in the area. Death On 26 August 2006, Akbar Bugti was killed after the cave in which he was hiding collapsed. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, during a press conference, gave details regarding the death of Akbar Bugti. The Director General claims that the soldiers were rushed to the nine-foot-wide mouth of the L-shape cave after one of the two guides hired to help locate Nawab Akbar Bugti in the Kohlu area had signaled that 'he was inside' the cave. The guides belonged to Bugti tribe. The Director General claims that the soldiers had gone into the cave \\"to negotiate with Akbar Bugti\\". The soldiers were ordered to apprehend Akbar Bugti, and not harm or kill him. Once the soldiers had entered the cave, a \\"blast of undetermined origin\\" took place. The blast brought down the cave, killing all occupants in the process. The Director General claimed that no fighting or use of explosives preceded the \\"mysterious\\" blast which resulted in its collapse. Moreover, Director General claimed that around 100 million Rupees and $96,000 cash, two satellite phones, documents, eight AK-47 rifles and some rockets were found in the rubble of the cave. Similarly, some analysts also believe that no official orders were given to kill Akbar Bugti. As Akbar Bugti was politically isolated because of the decision of Bugti tribesmen during a Jirga in Dera Bugti. The Jirga of Bugti tribesmen had declared an end to the Sardari (feudal) system and proclaimed that Akbar Bugti was no longer their leader. Hence, it was not logical to launch a direct military operation to kill the ailing old Akbar Bugti. However, according to some news reports, the cave collapsed because of the crossfire between the soldiers and the militants. As a result, 21 soldiers and 60 militants along with Akbar Bugti were killed. Later on, Pakistan military took media teams to the cave where Akbar Bugti was killed. Pakistan army engineers cleared the rubble of the cave to retrieve the bodies of Akbar Bugti and others who were killed inside the cave. On 31 August 2006, the body of Akbar Bugti was found crushed under a boulder. He was identified through the glasses and Rolex wristwatch which was used by Akbar Bugti. His glasses, walking stick and Rolex wristwatch was presented to the journalists. =Brahamdagh Bugti's claims= The Chairman of the Baloch Youth Council (London), Waja Mir Hazar Khan Baloch, said that Balach Marri was behind the murder of Akbar Bugti. Hazar Khan said that he heard this accusation from Brahamdagh Bugti and that Brahamdagh Bugti told him that the cave in which Akbar Bugti was hiding in, came down due to blast by remote control and Balach Marri was standing just outside the cave at that time. Balach Marri was the head of Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) at that time. Aftermath On 1 September 2006 Bugti was buried in Dera Bugti, with his coffin sealed, next to the graves of his son and brother. His family, who wanted a public funeral in Quetta, did not attend the burial. Some of family members of Akber Bugti and People from Bugti tribe thinks that the dead-body buried in Dera Bugti was not of Akber Bugti . url=http://nation.com.pk/national/23-Dec-2015/plea-filed-in-atc-seeking- exhumation-of-akbar-bugti-s-grave On 26 September 2010 Abdul Qayyum Khan Jatoi, a senior Pakistan federal minister, criticized and accused the army of killing Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Bugti as well as the Pakistani politician, Benazir Bhutto. He later resigned when his political party summoned him and asked him to explain his comments. Investigation and prosecution On 11 July 2012, a Pakistani anti-terrorism court in Sibi, Balochistan, issued arrest warrants for the former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf and several other high-ranking officials who were accused of involvement in the killing of Akbar Bugti. The other officials included the former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, former Interior Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, former Governor of Balochistan Owais Ahmed Ghani, former Chief Minister of Balochistan Jam Mohammad Yousaf, former Provincial Home Minister Shoaib Nosherwani, and former Deputy Commissioner Abdul Samad Lasi. All these were named suspects in the F.I.R. registered by police regarding the killing of Bugti in the military operation. Musharraf was formally arrested by a police team from Balochistan on 13 June 2013, however was later granted bail due to his poor health and ultimately due to non-provision of evidence.

The building is set back behind a long drive and former outbuildings once for estate servants, The Gatehouse and The Coach House. It is accessed from road leading to Chertsey and also known today as Ribsden Hall, marked as Ribsden Holt on its gates. Its effective owner-occupiers (and their trustees or widows) were from construction until 1974: Henry Cadogan Rothery, Richard Copley Christie, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll and Princess Patricia of Connaught, with one period of uncertainty -- Princess Louise occupied for a time from its sale by auction in 1911 until 1939. During the set of years mentioned may have been intermediate owners as it is unknown whether the trustees for the Princess bid at the auction in 1911 or afterwards. History and architecture Ribsden House was built for Henry Cadogan Rothery in the late 1870s who died there in 1888.The Times, 3 Aug. 1888 p.10, 6 Aug. p.9, 8 Aug. p.9 The site north of Chertsey Road, then a barren track, formed part of fuel allotments to the poor in the Enclosure Act of 1814, where they were allowed to carry away “turves, furze, fern or other fuel.” The money the parishioners raised from the land/rights sale was used, until the late 20th century, “for the distribution of the “Ribsden Coals” at Christmas, mainly to senior citizens or to other needy persons in the village\\". The Ribsden Coal Charity has now been incorporated into The Poor Allotments Charity, covering the then-parish (now Bagshot, Lightwater and Windlesham).The Windlesham Magazine, December 2013 edition In 1867 Rothery was appointed by the Government as their Commissioner enquiring into maritime losses and casualties, which enabled him to travel extensively to Australia, British Guiana, Dominica and Madagascar and pursue his keen interest in botany, particularly ferns, at the same time. His wife Madelaine continued to live here until her death in October 1891. The house maintained a library, photographed in one source. The Surrey Heath Museum retains Mr Rothery’s accounts book for 1879 / 1880 -- e.g. an entry in 1879 records these costs: > Coal and Wood 2 shillings > Help and luggage to the station 4 shillings 6 pence > Stable broom 2 shilings 6 pence > Telegram 1 shiling. A second notebook records various remedies for the horses, including how to make a poultice for wounds of the joints or tendons: “sal-ammoniac powder\\" Ribsden was bought by Richard Copley Christie and his wife Mary Helen in circa 1891 / 1892. Educated at Oxford, he was called to the bar in Lincoln’s Inn in 1857 and in 1872 he became chancellor of the diocese of Manchester, in post until 1893. He was appointed trustee of the extensive benevolent settlements (trusts) of industrialist, Sir Joseph Whitworth (d.1887). Funds from this estate were used to build a home for people with cancer – renamed the Christie Hospital in their honour. Confronted with new diseases such as mule spinners’ cancer and chimney sweeps’ cancer, doctors started to look for possible links to machine oils and airborne soot. The use of x-rays in 1901 and radium in 1905 were developed at this hospital. On moving to Windlesham the Christies brought with them their groom, Harry Carnell, who was the grandfather of local resident, Joan Weymouth. In 1901 he is recorded as living in accommodation above the stables and coach house with his wife, sister-in-law and daughter of 2 years, and employed in the position of groom and coachman. Richard Christie died on 9 January 1901 at Ribsden and in honour of his memory Mary donated funds to the Windlesham Institute, which were used to develop its building to include a stage to enable concerts and theatre performances. The entrance door to the theatre bears a plaque “1901.” On 1 February 1911 Mary Helen Christie died, aged 73,General Register Office registers, March Quarter of 1911, Volume 2a page 61, Chertsey Reg.

Story The first series, \\"The Nightmare Begins\\", is a set of 25 stories about a businessman arriving at the hotel after taking a train home from work. He encounters the mysterious owner of the hotel, an old mouse known as Gregory, who suggests that he stay awhile in Room 205. Gregory gradually erodes away his individuality, denouncing the first guest as nothing more than a small part of himself. The man soon becomes drawn into a bizarre series of events taking place within Gregory House as he tries desperately to escape from this purgatory. Though he escapes back to his wife and son, he finds reality too boring, and returns voluntarily. It is heavily implied that he becomes an empty shell, Haniwa Salaryman. The second series, \\"The Second Guest\\", is similarly set with 25 stories, except this time the main victim is a woman who has just taken a taxi home from her best friend's wedding ceremony. She has had to endure many failed relationships and careers. It is also implied that her old flame was once the first guest, but their relationship went disastrously wrong. Due to her insanity from the degrading events, she starts a fire, burning down the house - however, the Gregory family survive, and welcome her into their family. The third series, \\"The Last Train\\", is set with 26 stories during a bizarre train ride that Gregory embarks upon. It differs from the previous two series in that there is no guest, nor is the hotel the central setting. Instead, Gregory himself is the protagonist, and the series takes place on the previously mentioned train as Gregory tries to escape from his own house and his role as the innkeeper. However, like the previous two protagonists, he fails, and the train only takes him back to Gregory House. The fourth series, \\"The Bloody Karte\\" (presented as a side series on the DVDs), is a set of 12 stories about Catherine working in a mysterious hospital. An unbroadcasted exclusive Special series, \\"The Gregory Gallery Tour\\"(presented as bonus videos only on the first series DVDs), only contains 3https://forums.lostmediawiki.com/thread/4690/gregory-horror-gallery-special- series?page=1 stories featuring Gregory himself as a guide, giving his commentary and thoughts on each of the guests in the hotel, also displaying paintings based around the said guests. The setting is different depending on each of the 3 episodes. (These are only on the NEC Interchannel or King Records versions of the first series DVDs, volume 1-3, Japanese only) Characters ; :Voiced by: Chafurin (Japanese); Dave Pettitt (English) :Gregory is the Innkeeper of the hotel and also the narrator, a slightly creepy old anthropomorphic mouse with an obsession for keeping guests at his hotel. He loves to mess with one's mind and has a habit of appearing out of nowhere. It is strongly implied that Gregory is a manifestation of the hidden dreams and desires that people suppress, and his hotel the same. Although how several different people can manifest the exact same apparition is unknown, and it is highly probable that Gregory is in fact a spirit of dreams and desires, instead of a single person's manifestation. Gregory's aims seem unclear in both the game and the series, but he seems to be subservient to his mother, who is thoroughly and unambiguously wicked, unlike Gregory, consuming wayward souls to remain young. Gregory himself is more morally ambiguous, since he never overtly harms the guest, though he never makes any attempt to prevent harm coming to them. This may be because everyone in the hotel is effectively immortal, however. While enigmatic, he is, if nothing else, polite and sincere. To the unseen guest of the 1st series, he always refers to him as \\"My friend\\" and to female guest of the 2nd series, as \\"My dear\\". One thing is clear though, Gregory is indestructible and inescapable. Even if the guest tries to flee the purgatory of his hotel, or attempt to destroy him, they'll still somehow return, and Gregory will still be there, keeping their room ready for them. In the third series, Gregory is more unambiguously sympathetic, trying to escape from his role as the keeper of Gregory House and enduring as many strange and bizarre events as either of the previous protagonists. Like them, he ultimately fails to escape, suggesting that even he is a prisoner in his strange world despite his ostensible mastery and ownership of it. In the game, a player can overhear him monologuing about how s/he wouldn't be in any danger if they simply accepted the purgatory of Gregory House, but several times in both the series and the game, Gregory is seen to be an antagonistic force, putting his guests, and even himself, quite literally through hell. :In the exclusive Gregory Gallery Tour series, Gregory seems to have vast knowledge about the guests in the hotel, as he gives a tour to an unseen audience. He also seems to have the ability to impersonate each of their personalities and certain parts of their appearances. As is typical for a man his age, Gregory also has a secret, although it is not a secret among the other residents of the hotel - a liking for dirty magazines. He often reads them when he thinks he is alone; in the game, his secret place for reading the magazines is the storeroom. ; :Voiced by: Erina Yamazaki (Japanese); Brett Bauer (English) :He is Gregory's grandson, a mischievous young mouse who loves to play pranks on anyone he can find. He drives Gregory to despair and distraction. In the videogame, he is the one who allowed the guests to steal bottled souls from Gregory's Mama. He hates being alone, so he hopes the wandering guest in the game will stay forever so that they can get into all kinds of trouble together. ; :Voiced by: Nao Nagasawa (Japanese); Onalea Gilbertson (English) :He is a zombie cat who once lived with a family that stayed in Gregory's Hotel. Once a glossy beautiful cat, it escaped from reality and ended up at the hotel where Gregory stitched up its eyes, mouth and ears as act of revenge, possibly against cats in general due to their inter-species conflict. His room is nothing more than a prison cell, revealing the true nature of this strange place. :He is the character who seems the most supportive of the protagonist in both the game and the series, as he is constantly giving them hints on how to battle their inner demons. More than anything, Neko wants the guest to escape this purgatory. He also attempts to kill Gregory and his mother during the Great Fire of Gregory House (during the series, this fire is caused by him). He ends up turning to ash when Gregory House is burned down, though is heavily implied to be reincarnated along with the other guests when the hotel \\"resurrects\\" itself. :He is a manifestation of a broken heart, stitched together by anger and misery. ; :Voiced by: Ayana Inoue (Japanese, TV series), Minako Ichiki (Japanese, Bloody Karte); Elinor Holt (English) :She is a pink lizard nurse with a giant syringe. She has an obsessive desire to steal blood from guests, and searches for any excuse she can find to do so. One suck of her syringe appears to drain almost all of a person's blood. She easily falls in love with people with nice veins, but she is also shown to take blood for no reason other than personal pleasure, suggesting that it may be fetishistic in nature. She has had relationships with many characters throughout the house, although all of them have ended badly - usually for the other person. ; :Voiced by: Naochika Hayashida (Japanese); Brendan Hunter (English) A set of anthropomorphic scales balanced between love and money. He passes judgment on all of the troubled souls of the hotel, and can see through anyone's lies. His skills at determining the truth are slightly questionable.

He often butchers/poisons the guests that don't eat or refuse his meals (even if they are just not hungry), and then serves them to other guests. He speaks with a dark, sinister, evil voice. :He is apparently very particular and passionate about his food preparation, and refuses to eat anyone's cooking but his own. He hates smokers/smoking because \\"They are the enemy of cuisine!\\" (he hates that it eventually numbs the taste buds). The candle on his head is almost always seen burning because it somewhat acts as his life spark - if it's blown out, he stops moving and his eyes stop glowing, and when it is re-lit, he continues as if nothing had happened. ; :Voiced by: Naoko Matsui (Japanese); Angie Beers (English) :She is a poor girl looking forever for her doll.

The general premise of the game involves the player (who can choose to be male or female) trying to escape from Gregory House, a deranged hotel run by the old mouse Gregory. The game involves having to steal bottled souls from twelve guests, and returning them to Death before going to sleep in Room 101. In the game, Neko Zombie helps explain the gameplay and introduces the player to mental health. Mental health acts like a health gauge of the player's mental fortitude. The player must maintain a good level of mental health by sleeping, reading books, or using special \\"herb\\" items reminiscent of the Resident Evil game series. If the player's mental health completely runs out, then the character goes insane, and becomes a permanent guest at Gregory House. While the bizarre cube-esque graphics (which were a staple of the 'anime') give the game an unusual look for a survival horror game, there is still an element of tension and unease because the player must creep around the hotel, avoiding detection by the various guests. If the player gets caught by one of them, then the guest will attack them by forcing them to watch some 'Horror Shows', a bizarre vision of violence set in a traditional Japanese theatre in which the guest will inflict severe harm upon you. The game features a goldmine of easter eggs and backstory which either reference or expand upon certain events of the series. For example, in the 'Bloody Karte' arc, Catherine develops an attraction for Hell's Chef; in the game, the player can find a signed trading card of him in the psychotic nurse's treatment room. Also, if a player takes the time to follow the guests around the building at various points in the game, they will often divulge interesting tidbits about the hotel and each other. For example, if the player follows Gregory around early in the game, a huge amount of how Neko Zombie came to be the way he is can be learned. Mobile game Milky cartoons and Unframe Inc launched a mobile game based on the show in October 2018 for the android and iPhone, entitled: Gregory Horror Show: Lost Qualia. So far, the game is only available in the Japanese app store. an English version has yet to appear in the United States and Europe. Gregory Horror Show: Lost Qualia is a gacha-based Rpg mobile game that combines the elements of dungeon crawling with a Gacha card system. Lost Qualia uses the original 3d cube-esque graphics and style that the series is known for. The main storyline tells of the player showing up at Gregory House, where Gregory the manager himself meets the player and tells him about a previous guest known only as \\"that man\\". Gregory further explains that the guests delusional beliefs has gotten far too powerful, and that he is able to take over the hotel, turn it into a dungeon, and distort the surreal world around it. Gregory wants the player to help him and the other guests on a quest to take back Gregory House and defeat the man, who is mad with delusional power. The main quest also takes the player and company outside the hotel to the cactus sibling's homeland, (seen in volume 3) which is called Cactus Land. The quest also takes the player & co. to Roulette boy's casino. Like the ps2 videogame, The player has a hotel room that serves as the central hub when they finish the tutorial or start up the game. They are able to customize their room with items they get either in a quest or in the Gacha cards from the fortune teller, level up their characters, and manage their Gacha cards and deck to us in a quest. Occasionally and randomly, Gregory, Neko Zombie, Catherine, Hell's Chef, and other playable characters will drop by to visit the player in their room talking to them and offer their support in a quest where the player is able to optionally choose them and play as them in any level. If the player has a playable character unlocked from either in a quest or found in Gacha card pack they can engage in conversation with the other visiting characters in the player's room, usually giving their commentary on the player, the current situation, and chat among themselves based on relationships they have with the other characters, or different topics. The in-game has the player, Gregory, or other playable characters going through a labyrinth, where they battle through hostile mages and souls that lurk in the dungeons and can appear from anywhere. Using melee attacks, throwable or ranged items, or using Gacha cards to regain health, buff their attacks or speed, special abilities, and using \\"horror show\\" Gacha cards to even the odds with one or many hostile souls surrounding them. The objective is for the player to survive and reach the goal to complete the level, sometimes having to climb stairs to the next floor to get there. Optionally, the player can set the game in autoplay (similar to idle rpg) where the AI takes over for the player on certain parts of the game or just taping the move button on-screen has the playable character temporarily moving through a corridor and resuming control back to the Player when they are in an area with more room. While reaching the goal is important, it also vital for the player to look for Kinko safes around the dungeon for items such as skull gems, soul energy, or gacha cards for the possibility of getting new customize hotel room items or unlocking a character to keep permanently and play as in a quest. In addition to the main story quest, there are 2 types of quest offered in the game, Event quests that can sometimes be holiday-based events or special events that are added in the game during updates and have their own storylines. for example, the \\"Gregory Quest\\" events tell about the player, Gregory, Neko zombie, and the other guests getting sucked up by TV fish and entering into a world based on fantasy RPG videogames and became RPG characters based on character classes, each with their own quest in each Gregory quest event. Depending on certain quest events and levels, both will automatically have the player play as specific characters as they have specific quests in the event storyline. or Ranked quests which are competitive survival quests where the player have to fight through hostile souls to reach the highest position of the leaderboard, depending on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd position when a ranking quest ends, the winning player earns a trophy to display in their hotel room. Manga A manga adaptation called Gregory Horror Show: Another World by Suzuki Sanami started in the November 1, 2007 issue of Weekly Morning magazine; it was then published as a graphic novel and released in Japan, on September 22, 2008. It follows Tooru Takenozuka, a 22-year-old freeter who comes to the city to follow his dreams. Thanks to his status he is unable to find an apartment to live in until a seedy real estate agent introduces him to Gregory House. He ends up in Room 404 and endures the nightmarish surroundings and residents. Over the course of chapters, it is revealed that Takenozuka's very form and spirit, is in a state of constant flux. He is, in reality, a lot older, though part of him could never accept the fact that he grew beyond his twenties without accomplishing anything extraordinary or wonderful with his life. All of his dreams and ambitions went unfulfilled. As Gregory is a collector of the rare and unusual, he takes an instant liking to Takenozuka. The man battles between choosing his dreams and the reality that he has responsibilities as a father. Though he manages to escape Gregory, like all the protagonists, he eventually wanders back, becoming a permanent guest who refuses to abandon his dreams. Mystery Holiday The creator's website announced in 2016 that a new Gregory Show was to be produced. Little is known about it other than a plot synopsis and some redesigns. It seems that the main character will be a kid named Hiroshi who wanders into Gregory House on a whim hoping it will grant his wishes but has to stop Gregory's evil plan to destroy the world. No release date has been announced.

Located at the town of Keddie, it joins the east-west Feather River Route with the \\"Inside Gateway\\" (BNSF Gateway Subdivision) north to Bieber. The west and north legs of the wye are on bridges over Spanish Creek, and the southeast leg runs through a tunnel (Tunnel No. 32). Just to the northwest, where the two bridged legs join, is Tunnel No. 31. The wye and the town are named for Arthur Keddie, who purchased the survey rights and the right to build a railroad through the Feather River Canyon from George Jay Gould I, the son of Jay Gould. History The Western Pacific Railroad (now part of the Union Pacific) built the tracks along the Feather River in 1909 to complete a route from the San Francisco Bay Area to Salt Lake City, Utah, providing an alternate to the Southern Pacific's route over Donner Pass. Keddie was the site of the \\"last spike\\" ceremony held on November 1, 1909. The Feather River route was preferred by some over the Donner Pass route through the Sierra Nevada because the high point of the former (the Chilcoot Tunnel under Beckwourth Pass) is at a lower elevation — about as opposed to — and most of the route is at a gentler grade than the line over Donner Pass. Construction started on the branch running north to Bieber in 1930 and was completed in 1931, along with the north and southeast legs of the wye. This allowed the Western Pacific to diverge from its east-west route (along the west leg of the wye) and go north to an interchange with the Great Northern Railway (now BNSF Railway) and its traffic from the Pacific Northwest. Railfanning The Keddie Wye is a favorite railfan spot and is part of Plumas County's 7 Wonders of the Railroad World. Access to the site is described in the county travel guide.

The three-storey mansion was built in the 1770s and divided into apartments in 1802. Building The Albany was built in 1771–1776 by Sir William Chambers for the newly created 1st Viscount Melbourne as Melbourne House. It is a three-storey mansion, seven bays (windows) wide, with a pair of service wings flanking a front courtyard. In 1791, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, abandoned Dover House, Whitehall (now a government office), and took up residence. In 1802 the Duke in turn gave up the house and it was converted by Henry Holland into 69 bachelor apartments (known as \\"sets\\"). This was achieved by subdividing the main block and its two service wings, and by adding two new parallel long buildings covering most of the garden, running as far as a new rear gate building on Burlington Gardens. Holland's new buildings of 1802–1803 flank a covered walkway supported on thin iron columns and with an upswept roof. The blocks are white painted render in a simpler Regency style than Chambers' work. Most sets are accessed off common staircases without doors, like Oxbridge colleges and the Inns of Court. History From the time of its conversion, the Albany was a prestigious set of bachelor apartments. Residents have included the poet Lord Byron and the future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, and numerous members of the aristocracy. During the Second World War, one of the buildings received significant damage from a German bomb, but was reconstructed after the war to appear as an exact replica. Residents no longer have to be bachelors, although children under the age of 14 are not permitted to live there. Ownership and governance The apartments or \\"sets\\" are individually owned as flying freeholds, with the owners known as \\"Proprietors\\"; a set that came up for sale in 2007 had an advertised guide price of £2 million. Around half the sets were owned by Peterhouse, a college of the University of Cambridge. These were acquired by William Stone (1857–1958) during the Second World War. Stone, nicknamed the \\"Squire of Piccadilly\\", was a former scholar of Peterhouse, a bachelor and a lifelong resident of the Albany. He bequeathed 37 sets to the college, along with other endowments. The Albany is governed by a Board of Trustees on behalf of the Proprietors. The annual rent of a set can be as much as £50,000 and prospective tenants are vetted by a committee before being allowed to take up residence. Name Drawing by Thomas H. Shepherd, c. 1830 The names \\"Albany\\" and \\"the Albany\\" have both been used. The rules adopted in 1804 laid down that \\"the Premises mentioned in the foregoing Articles shall be called Albany\\". Both names have been used in the 19th and 20th centuries. In a 1958 review of a book about the building, Peace in Piccadilly, The Times wrote, \\"Albany or the Albany? It has long been a snobbish test of intimate knowledge of the West End. If one was in use, a man could feel superior by using the other. When G. S. Street wrote The Ghosts of Piccadilly in 1907, he said that 'the Albany' was then 'universal', but that to the earliest tenants it was 'Albany'.\\"\\"Designed for Living\\", The Times, 26 June 1958, p. 13 In fiction An early use of the building in fiction was the novel, The Bachelor of the Albany (1847) by Marmion Wilard Savage. Still earlier is the hero of Benjamin Disraeli’s novel Sybil (1845), Charles Egremont, who lives there; he has a portrait by Christifano Allori hung over his fireplace halfway through the book. Mr Fascination Fledgeby, a moneylender in Charles Dickens' novel, Our Mutual Friend (1865) is described as living there. Several scenes from the book take place in his apartment. In the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) by Oscar Wilde, Lord Fermor, the uncle of the character Lord Henry Wotton, resides in the Albany. In Oscar Wilde's play, The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), the character John (Jack) Worthing has a set at the Albany (number B.4), where he lives while staying in London under the assumed name of Ernest. A. J. Raffles, the gentleman burglar created by E. W. Hornung who first appeared in \\"The Ides of March\\" (1898), lived at the Albany, as did the adventurer Lord John Roxton of Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Lost World (1912), and Roger Sheringham, the amateur detective in the works of Anthony Berkeley Cox who first appeared in The Layton Court Mystery (1925). In the comic short story \\"Uncle Fred Flits By\\" (1935) by P. G. Wodehouse, the young gentleman Pongo Twistleton resides in the Albany. In The Foundling (1948), a novel by Georgette Heyer, Captain Gideon Ware of the Life Guards rents a set of chambers at the Albany. In the film Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), Louis Mazzini takes a small set at Albany as he moves up the social ladder. In the James Bond novel Moonraker by Ian Fleming (1955), Max Meyer, the bridge partner of Sir Hugo Drax, was said to live in Albany. In the Major Harry Maxim novels by Gavin Lyall, George Harbinger, Harry's boss, who first appears in The Secret Servant (1980), has an apartment at Albany where he lives with his spouse, Annette. In Julian Fellowes' novel Belgravia (2016), Mr. John Bellasis resides in an apartment at Albany. In Graham Greene’s The Human Factor (1978), Dr. Percival resides at D.6.

ALPA was founded on 27 July 1931Checking In at ALPA HQ - 1931 to TodaySantiago, J.

Known internationally as U.S.-ALPA, ALPA is also a member of the IFALPA. History ALPA was founded by Captain David L. Behncke and 23 other key figures in Chicago, Illinois, on July 27, 1931. In the 1930s, flying was a perilous occupation; thus, from the time of its formation, one of ALPA’s main goals was to improve air safety. In 1933, the decision by the National Labor Board to limit the flight time for pilots and co-pilots to 85 hours a month was the result of the union’s first major lobbying campaign to make the skies safer. By the end of the ‘30s, the association had persuaded numerous airlines to form air traffic control centers, and had started the Airworthiness and Performance Committee, the first ALPA technical committee dedicated to improving flight safety.A HISTORY OF PRIDE: 80 Years of Pilots Putting Safety and Security First In the 1940s, numerous ALPA pilots enlisted in the military to help the United States battle the Axis powers during World War II. In this decade, ALPA created additional air safety committees, and the newly established International Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations (IFALPA) worked to improve flight safety around the world. In 1951, ALPA created an internal air safety system, which developed into the world’s biggest independent, nongovernmental safety structure. During the 1950s, jet travel was introduced, marking a new period for the air industry. In this era, crew fatigue became a greater concern for pilots, with the union successfully persuading the Civil Aeronautics Board to stop airlines from scheduling impractical flights. During the 1960s, jet transport of people and goods became commonplace, with ALPA addressing the new safety issues that came with this type of travel. In 1961, ALPA’s second president, Clarence N. Sayen, directly asked new U.S. President John F. Kennedy to make hijacking a federal crime, which subsequently became the law of the land in September of that year. The Southern Airways strike of 1960-62, a conflict that ALPA winningly took on in a dispute over pilot wages, is the longest walkout in the union’s history. For years, ALPA had lobbied hard for the creation of an independent government agency that would investigate accidents, and in 1967, the National Transportation Safety Board was established to conduct such investigations. In 1972, ALPA began an anti-skyjacking lobby offensive, among other efforts to fight air terrorism, which was all too common in the early 1970s. Also in 1972, after decades of campaigning by ALPA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established an airport certification program, which required airport operators to prove they are following safety standards. In 1976, the union’s dedicated work resulted in NASA creating the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS), a database of confidential incident reports. During the 1980s, ALPA accomplished much in the way of safety. In 1981, among other achievements, the Association convinced the FAA that “fasten seatbelt” signs were needed, and in 1987, the FAA again heeded calls from the union, requiring the installation of a traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) in every airplane. On March 4th, 1989, ALPA pilots at Eastern Airlines went on strike in support of the International Association of Machinists. The pilots stood their ground for 285 days. Following the 1994 crash of USAir Flight 427, in which all 132 people on board were killed, the NTSB ruled that pilot error was the cause. But ALPA fought that decision, and in the end, it was found that a malfunction in the rudder control system of the B-737 plane was likely the cause. Subsequently, a redesign of all B-737’s—the most commonly flown commercial airplane—was ordered by the FAA. After another tragic 1994 crash, of American Eagle Flight 4184, a study of icing issues with the ATR 72 commenced, an inquiry ALPA was closely involved with. The outcomes were alterations in the design of the ATR 72 and improved pilot training. ALPA’s chief accomplishment of the 1990s was the 1995 enactment of the “One Level of Safety” program by the FAA, resulting in stricter safety rules for smaller airplanes. ALPA came up with the name for the program and lobbied hard for the measure. In 1997, the Canadian Airline Pilots Association (CALPA) merged with ALPA, forming what would become known as ALPA Canada.\\"Our Third Decade of Moving Canadian Aviation Forward,\\" by Capt. Dan Adamus, Air Line Pilot, January-February 2018 As of 2020, ALPA Canada represents more than 5,000 pilots. In 2000, after years of advocacy by the association, the FAA approved ALPA’s recommendations for Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO). In the wake of the catastrophic September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, improving airline security would be ALPA’s main priority for the next several years. This concentrated effort by the union included the formation of their Security Task Force, instrumental in the creation of numerous new security rules. During the 2010s, ALPA continued to campaign for improvements in airline security and safety. One such issue was the deliberate and dangerous act of pointing lasers at pilots in the air. Thanks to ALPA’s efforts, a new law was enacted making this undertaking a federal crime. In 2020, amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, ALPA pressed governments in the United States and Canada to pass legislation that would protect airline employees. The association was actively involved in the talks that resulted in the CARES Act, which stabilized the aviation industry and provided economic relief for pilots.

Little remains of the original building, so excavations of the palace took place in 1964 to rediscover its extent. Palace Much of the foundation stone for the palace came from Chertsey Abbey which fell into ruins after the Dissolution of the Monasteries.Elmbridge museum Henry VIII acquired the house in 1538, and rebuilt it for Anne of Cleves. The palace was built around three main adjoining quadrangular courtyards covering fourteen hectares and utilising an existing 15th-century moated manor house.Oatlands Palace from the Gatehouse He married Catherine Howard in the palace on 28 July 1540.Six wives of Henry VIII Henry's subsequent wife, Catherine Parr, spent time at the Palace as well. Records of her writings include a letter sent from Oatlands to her brother, William, Lord Parr, shortly after her marriage to the King in July 1543.Katherine Parr: Complete Works and Correspondence, editor Janel Mueller. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2011. pg 46. Paul van Somer It subsequently became the residence, at various times, of Mary I, Elizabeth I, James I and Charles I. It was to Oatlands that Mary Tudor retreated after her supposed pregnancy. Her previous residence, Hampton Court Palace, had housed the nursery staff that was assembled for the birth of the child. The announcement of a movement to Oatlands (considerably smaller than Hampton) ended any hope of a happy outcome of the Queen's pregnancy. James I's wife Anne of Denmark built a silkworm house and a vineyard, and employed Inigo Jones to design an ornamental gateway from the Privy Garden to the Park.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), pp. 69-70. Her collection at Oatlands included portraits of her Danish nephews, her courtiers Jean Drummond, Mary Middlemore, Tom Durie, and her own portrait by Paul van Somer with her horse, hunting dogs, and African servant, showing the new gateway and the palace in a background.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), pp. 97, 168-172. Oatlands was one of the properties settled upon Henrietta Maria on her marriage to Charles I and she used it as a country retreat, installing part of her art collection on site, and employing John Tradescant the elder for its gardens. In August 1637 it was rumoured she was sickening with consumption, and at Oatlands drinking asses milk as a remedy.HMC 4th Report: Earl de la Warr (London, 1874), p. 293. In 1646 Oatlands was a temporary home of the infant Princess Henrietta of England, daughter of Charles I of England and later Duchess of Orleans, sister-in-law of Louis XIV. Her governess Lady Dalkeith smuggled her into France in the summer of 1646. After the King's execution some Royal residences were sold by the Commonwealth Government to help pay Parliamentary debts. Oatlands Palace and its contents were purchased for about £4,000 by Robert Turbridge. He demolished it and sold the bricks to Sir Richard Weston of Sutton Place. A single house - remote from the site of the palace itself - may have originally functioned as a hunting lodge. House After the Restoration, during the 1660s, the house was the residence of William Boteler who had supported the Commonwealth and served as one of the ten major-generals during the Rule of the Major-Generals (1656), during which time he was noted as being harsh on Roman Catholics, Quakers and Cavaliers. The house was later occupied and extended by Sir Edward Herbert, the Lord Chief Justice, but was forfeited to the Crown when he followed James II into exile. It was then awarded to his brother, Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Torrington, who was later the admiral in command of the English and Dutch Fleets at the Battle of Beachy Head. The house was again enlarged by the Duke of Newcastle, Henry Clinton, who laid out formal gardens. In 1790, Oatlands was leased from the Crown by the Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany the second son of George III, and the subject of the nursery rhyme The Grand Old Duke of York. His architect was Henry Holland. In his second London notebook, composer Joseph Haydn recorded a two-day visit in November 1791: He was the guest of the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, playing music for four hours each evening. Mansion and hotel Lodges and entrance gates to Oatlands Park Hotel In 1794 the mansion was burnt down and was quickly rebuilt in the Gothic style of the period. After the death of the Duchess of York in 1820, the whole property was sold. It was bought by Edward Hughes Ball Hughes in 1824 (although it was not until after The Duke's death in 1827 that the sale was finally concluded) and again remodelled in 1830. Hughes had tried to dispose of the estate by public auction in 1829 but this part did not sell. He let the mansion and adjoining parkland to Francis, Lord Egerton for a seven-year period in 1832 and renewed for a similar period in 1839. The arrival of the London and South Western Railway in 1838 made the area ripe for daily commuting to London. In 1846 the estate was broken up into lots for building development and sold at three public auctions in May, August and September of that year. Following a period of private ownership by James Watts Peppercorne, the house became a hotel in 1856, known as the South Western (later Oatlands Park) Hotel. From 1916 to 1918, during World War I, the hotel was used as a hospital for New Zealand troops injured in France. Subsequently, one of the main streets in Walton-on- Thames was renamed New Zealand AvenueNew Zealand Avenue in honour of those men. The four-star Oatlands Park Hotel now occupies the site where the Oatlands mansion (Oatlands House) once stood, and there are still some signs of the earlier stages in its existence visible within the core of the building. It is not on the site of Oatlands Palace, down the hill towards the centre of Weybridge, once the same estate in land.

Born near Bedford to John and Ann Pilling, Dick moved to Church, Accrington, Lancashire in his infancy, which is where he made his name as one of the finest wicket-keepers of his time. In a first-class career lasting from 1877 to 1889 he played 250 matches, 8 of which were Test matches. In 1889 he was awarded a benefit by Lancashire: he raised £1,500. His first appearance in the Lancashire eleven dates back to the season of 1877. His appearance for Lancashire was very happily timed, as, with Mr. E. Jackson so often prevented by business reasons from playing, the northern county might have been left without a first-class wicket-keeper. Almost from the first time he was seen in the Lancashire team it was felt that a great wicket-keeper had arisen, and he at once sprang into the front rank. From August, 1877, down to the end of the season of 1889 he was a regular member of the Lancashire eleven, and several pages of Wisden might easily be filled with a record of his doings. For all the hard work he has done in the cricket field, Pilling was never constitutionally robust, and the serious illness which kept him out of the cricket field in 1890 originated in a severe cold which he caught during the winter when taking part in a football match. At the end of the summer he journeyed to Australia for the benefit of his health, leaving in the same steamer that took a large proportion of the Australian team. In 1891, Pilling was rated by Wisden to the second-best wicket-keeper in the world, with Jack Blackham being rated the best. His style was described as the perfection of neatness and rapidity, without the least unnecessary show. Pilling visited Australia with Alfred Shaw and Shrewsbury's team in 1881/2, and went out again under the same auspices in the winter of 1887/8, and it was on these tours and in games played at Lancashire's home ground of Old Trafford that he played his Test matches. At the time, it was feared that much of his subsequent ill- health dates from a sunstroke that he suffered during the former of these trips. As a batsman Pilling had an excellent style, and had often done capital work for his county. This led to Pilling being named as the Wisden Wicket- keeper of the Year in 1891. Unfortunately the accolade turned out to be a posthumous one. To try to improve his deteriorating health, he was sent on a cruise to Australia by Lancashire County Cricket Club in the winter 1890/1. It did not work, and Pilling died six days after returning home. Pilling was a stonemason by trade, and had a wife, Emma, and at least one child, Mary.

It was built in the 1760s by Matthew Brettingham for Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany and was originally called York House. The Duke of York died in 1767 aged just twenty eight and the house was taken over by Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, whose name it has retained. Plans of the ground and first floors of York (later Cumberland) House as designed by Matthew Brettingham. Brettingham's house was in a late Palladian style. It was seven bays wide with three main storeys plus basement and attics and was built of brick with stone dressings. The Duke of Cumberland made various alterations. He built a projecting west wing on the site of a neighbouring house that he purchased and added a pair of lodges flanking the forecourt, probably all to designs by Robert Adam. Adam also made many designs for remodelling the interiors, which are now in the collection at the Sir John Soane's Museum, but only a few of them were carried out. The Duke of Cumberland died in 1790, and in 1800, the widowed Duchess surrendered it to the banks who held mortgages on it. This map of circa 1870 shows Cumberland House as the central element of the War Office. The house was sold to the Union Club in 1801 and in 1806 it was purchased by the Board of Ordnance. From 1858 it housed the War Office. An eastern counterpart to the west wing was added in 1809. Cumberland House was used by the government for just over a hundred years. The War Office also acquired several neighbouring houses, including Schomberg House, and knocked them together to form a large office complex. Cumberland House was demolished in stages between 1908 and 1911. The site is now occupied by the Royal Automobile Club.

His father, then a young revolutionary in his mid-20s, left the child to be raised by his late wife's family. In 1921, when Dzhugashvili had reached the age of fourteen, he was brought to Moscow, where his father had become a leading figure in the Bolshevik government who eventually became head of the Soviet Union. Disregarded by Stalin, Dzhugashvili was a shy, quiet child who appeared quite unhappy and tried to commit suicide several times as a youth. Married twice, Dzhugashvili had three children, two of whom reached adulthood. Dzhugashvili studied to become an engineer, then – on his father's insistence – he enrolled in training to be an artillery officer. He finished his studies weeks before Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. Sent to the front, he either surrendered or was captured by the Germans, and was held as a prisoner. He died at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1943. It is not clear whether he committed suicide or was killed by camp guards. Early lifeGeorgia= Dzhugashvili was born in Baji, a village in the Kutais Governorate of the Russian Empire (now in Georgia). His mother, Kato Svanidze, was from Racha and a descendant of minor Georgian nobility. His father, Ioseb Dzhugashvili, was from Gori and was a Bolshevik revolutionary. A few months after Dzhugahshvili's birth, his father was involved in a high-profile Tiflis bank robbery, and the three of them fled to Baku to avoid arrest. They rented a \\"Tartar house with a low ceiling on the Bailov Peninsula\\" just outside city right on the sea. They returned to Tiflis in October that year as Svanidze was quite ill. She died on , having likely contracted typhus on the trip back. Ioseb left Tiflis immediately after her death, abandoning 8-month-old Iakob to be raised by his Svanidze relatives. Ioseb, who later adopted the name Joseph Stalin, would not return to visit his son for several years, and he would spend the next fourteen years being raised by his aunts. =Moscow= In 1921, Dzhugashvili was brought to Moscow to live with his father and two half- siblings, Svetlana and Vasily. This proved difficult for Dzhugashvili as he did not understand Russian and his father was hostile to him, even forbidding Dzhugashvili to adopt the name \\"Stalin.\\" It is not clear why Stalin had hostility to his son, but it is believed that he reminded Stalin of Svanidze, which was one of the happier times in Stalin's life. Living in Stalin's apartments at the Amusement Palace in the Kremlin, Dzhugashvili slept in the dining room. A kind individual, Dzhughashvili was close to his half-siblings, as well as his step-mother Nadezhda Alliluyeva, who was only six years older than him. Though Dzhugashvili was interested in studying at a university, Stalin did not initially allow it, and it was not until 1930 when he was 23 that Dzhugashvili was admitted. He graduated from the Institute of Transport in 1935, and for the next couple years worked as a chimney-sweep engineer at an electric plant factory named after his father. In 1937, he entered the Artillery Academy, and graduated from there on 9 May 1941. Marriage and family Dzhugashvili's first serious relationship was with Zoya Gunina, the daughter of an Orthodox priest and a former classmate of his. In 1928, Dzhugahsvili made it known that he wanted to marry Zoya, who was then sixteen. Stalin became enraged at the idea and in response Dzhugashvili attempted suicide, shooting himself in the chest and narrowly missing his heart. While Alliluyeva and Svetlana helped Dzhugashvili, Stalin is reported to have brushed off the attempt by saying \\"He can't even shoot straight.\\" Dzhugashvili spent several months in the hospital recovering from this ordeal, though the couple did ultimately marry and moved to Leningrad. A daughter was born on 7 February 1929, but she died eight months later of pneumonia and Dzhugahsvili and Gunina split up, although they did not officially divorce. After his return to Moscow, Dzhugashvili was rumoured to be marrying Ketevan Orakhelashvili, the daughter of Mamia Orakhelashvili, the First Secretary of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. However, Dzhugashvili was shy around her so she instead married Evgeni Mikeladze, a prominent orchestra conductor, earning ridicule from Stalin. His next girlfriend was Olga Golysheva, who was also a student at the Moscow Aviation School. They became engaged but soon that ended and she returned to her home in the Stalingrad Oblast. A son, Yevgeny was born on 10 January 1936, after Golysheva returned home. Dzugashvili only learnt of his son in 1938 and ensured he took his surname, though Stalin never recognised Yevgeny as his grandson. Dzhugashvili married Yulia Meltzer, a well-known Jewish dancer from Odessa. After meeting Meltzer at a reception in a restaurant, Dzhugashvili fought with her second husband, an NKVD officer called Nikolai Bessarab, an aide to Stanislav Redens, the head of the Moscow Oblast NKVD and brother-in-law of Stalin. They soon were married. Historian Miklós Kun has suggested that Meltzer \\"must have been tempted to gain entry into Stalin’s court by means of her marriage,\\" though this did not work due to the animosity between Stalin and Dzhugashvili. They soon moved into an apartment together, though were only legally married on 18 February 1938, the day before their only child, daughter Galina, was born. Second World War Memorial near Vitebsk noting where Dzhugashvili fought and was captured =Capture= Dzhugashvili shortly after being captured On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany and its allies launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Stalin ensured that Dzughashvili and Artyom Sergeyev, his adopted son and fellow artillery officer, went to the front lines. Serving as a lieutenant with a battery of the 14th Howitzer Regiment of the 14th Tank Division near Vitebsk, Dzhugashvili was captured on 16 July during the Battle of Smolensk. The circumstances of his capture are disputed: Sergeyev later said that \\"the Germans surrounded Yakov’s battery. The order was given to retreat. But Yakov did not obey the order. I tried to persuade him […] but Yakov answered: 'I am the son of Stalin and I do not permit the battery to retreat.\\" Other sources, including Soviet prisoners interrogated, claimed that they willingly gave up Dzhugashvili as they hated the Soviet system. Material from the Russian archives also suggests that he surrendered willingly. The Germans announced the capture of Dzughashvili on 19 July. Stalin reacted negatively to the news: he had previously ordered that no soldiers were to surrender, so the idea that his own son had done so was seen as a disgrace. He was angry that Dzughashvili had not killed himself instead of being captured, and suspected that someone had betrayed him. Meltzer was not immediately told the news and, suspicious of her motives and the idea that Dzhugashvili surrendered, Stalin had her arrested. With Meltzer imprisoned, Svetlana took care of Galina. =Prisoner of war= In an attempt to conceal his identity, Dzhugashvili apparently removed his officer's insignia and tried to pass as a soldier, though he was soon recognised and given to the Abwehr (German military intelligence) for interrogation. During the interrogation, Dzughashvili openly criticised his division and other units of the Red Army, saying they were unprepared for the war, and further commented that military commanders behaved poorly. He felt that the United Kingdom was weak and had \\"never helped anyone,\\" while praising Germany, noting it was the only major empire left and that the \\"whole of Europe would be nothing\\" without it. Though his wife and her family were ethnically Jewish, Dzughashvili was also openly anti-Semitic, claiming Jews \\"trade, or aspire to careers in engineering, but they do not want to be workers, technicians, or peasant laborers. That’s why no one in our country respects the Jews.\\" German propaganda 1941 saying \\"This is Yakov Dzhugashvili, Stalin's son and artillery officer ... who on 16 July has surrendered near Vitebsk, together with thousands of other soldiers and officers ... Follow his example - his is alive and well, and feels great ... Why do you fight to the death when even the son of your leader has surrendered?\\" The Germans intended to use Dzhugashvili in their propaganda against the Soviets. He was pictured on leaflets dropped over Soviet soldiers, shown smiling with his captors. The back of the leaflet was part of a letter he wrote to Stalin shortly after his capture: \\"Dear Father! I have been taken prisoner. I am in good health. I will soon be sent to a camp for officers in Germany. I am being treated well. I wish you good health! Greetings to everyone. Yasha.\\" The Soviet Union responded in kind via propaganda: Krasnaya Zvezda (\\"Red Star\\"), the official newspaper of the Red Army, announced on 15 August 1941 that Dzhugashvili would be awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his actions during the Battle of Smolensk. He was subsequently moved to a guarded villa in Berlin, where Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Propaganda Minister, hoped to use him on Russian-language radio broadcasts. When that failed to materialise, Dzhugashvili was moved to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. While interned there, Dzhugashvili was constantly frequented by visitors who wanted to meet and photograph the son of Stalin, meetings which began to distress him. He also quarrelled with the British prisoners, and would frequently get in physical altercations with them. After German Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus surrendered at the Battle of Stalingrad in February 1943, the Germans offered to exchange Dzhugashvili for him. This was outright refused by Stalin, who later stated \\"Just think how many sons ended in camps! Who would swap them for Paulus? Were they worse than Yakov?\\" According to Nikolai Tolstoy, there was another proposal as well, with Hitler wanting to exchange Dzhugashvili for Hitler's nephew Leo Raubal; but this was not accepted either. =Death= On 14 April 1943, Dzhugashvili died at the Sachsenhausen camp. The details of his death are disputed: one account has him running into the electric fence surrounding the camp. However, it has also been suggested that he was shot by the Germans; Kun has noted that it is \\"conceivable that he committed suicide: he had suicidal tendencies in his youth.\\" Upon hearing of his son's death, Stalin reportedly stared at his photograph; he would later soften his stance towards Dzhugashvili, saying he was \\"a real man\\" and that \\"fate treated him unjustly.\\" Meltzer would be released in 1946 and re-united with Galina, though the years apart had made Galina distant from her mother. In 1977, Dzhugashvili was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, first class, though that was done secretly and the family was not allowed to collect the medal itself. After the war, British officers in charge of captured German archives came upon the papers depicting Dzhugashvili's death at Sachsenhausen. The German records indicated that he was shot after he ran into an electric fence attempting to flee after an argument with the British prisoners; autopsy showed he died from electrocution before he was shot. The British Foreign Office briefly considered presenting these papers to Stalin at the Potsdam Conference as a gesture of condolence. They scrapped the idea because neither the British nor the Americans had informed the Soviets that they had captured key German archives, and sharing those papers with Stalin would have prompted the Soviets to inquire about the source of these records.

Allerton Castle, also known as Allerton Park, is a Grade I listed nineteenth-century Gothic or Victorian Gothic house at Allerton Mauleverer in North Yorkshire, England. It was rebuilt by architect George Martin, of Baker Street, London in 1843-53. It is ten miles (16 km) east of Harrogate and just east of the A1, at its junction with the A59 York-Knaresborough road and a late 20th-century block used for education and corporate functions.http://allertoncastle.co.uk/ Outside is St Martin's Church. HistoryPre-1786= The Allerton estate belonged to the Mauleverer family from the time of the Norman Conquest. The nearby church of St Martin contains several tomb-monuments to them. When Richard Mauleverer died heirless in 1692, Allerton passed to his wife, who left the estate to Richard Arundell, her son by her second marriage. Arundell rebuilt the house in the 1740s, and in 1745 remodelled the church in Norman revival style. The mid-18th century interior of the church remains unaltered to this day. =\\"The Grand Old Duke of York\\"= The Temple of Victory Following Richard Arundell's death in 1758, Allerton passed to Viscount Galway, whose son sold it in 1786 to Prince Frederick, Duke of York, second son of George III and brother of George IV. Prince Frederick rebuilt the house to designs by Henry Holland, but sold the estate shortly afterwards in 1789. He also constructed the Temple of Victory which is today visible from the A1 on a high hill. According to local legend, the ant-like activity of workers constantly ascending and descending to build this gigantic mound inspired the famous nursery rhyme concerning The Grand Old Duke of York and his 10,000 men.history at allertoncastle.co.uk =1805–1983= The estate changed hands again in 1805 when purchased by the 17th Baron Stourton, the premier baron in England. The Hon Edward Stourton's family owned the house from 1805 to 1983 (the Lords Mowbray). The contents were sold in 1965. It then became 'Stourton House', and the Catholic peer added a chapel in Gothic style. However, in 1843 his son demolished the Georgian house and engaged George Martin, to build the present house in a Tudor-Gothic style. In 1856 work came to a halt as there was not enough money to complete all the interiors. The house was used by the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War (for the headquarters of RAF Bomber Command's No. 6 Group RCAF) and in 1965. The family ceased to live there after the death of the 22nd Baron Stourton. =1983–present= In 1983 the house was sold to Dr Gerald Rolph, an American businessman. The purchase included the house and gardens, but not the surrounding park which was retained by Lord Mowbray. Dr Rolph set about renovating the building to the highest standards, filling the house with furniture and pictures of appropriate scale and splendour. The estate is now run by the Gerald Arthur Rolph Foundation for Historic Preservation and Education,Gerald Arthur Rolph Foundation for Historic Preservation and Education and rooms are available to hire for corporate events and weddings. A severe fire in January 2005 caused substantial damage to the north aspect of the castle, including the main dining room, library, rear entrance hall, two bedrooms and adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms and the Servants' Wing. Restoration work commenced in the spring of 2006 and is now more or less complete. The restoration work by specialist contractors consisted of substantial repairs to the ornate stonework and windows, the installation of new floors at first, second and attic levels, significant steelwork, and a new roof structure to match the existing roof. Electrical, plumbing and heating installations as well as plasterwork were also renewed. Arrangement A short drive leads past a late 18th-century stable-block before the visitor is confronted with the Tudor- Gothic Victorian building. The main block is built of dark-coloured stone, with a high tower rising above the entrance porch. The lower brick range to the right houses the Chapel of 1805, and behind are the lower buildings of the service courtyard, dating from the 18th century. The interior of Allerton was designed on a vast scale, with late-Gothic decoration in the style of Pugin's work on the Palace of Westminster. The early-Victorian craftsmanship and the recent restoration work are of the highest quality. The galleried great hall is one of the highest baronial halls in England, almost high, lit from a huge lantern which rises from the centre of the main block. It is adorned by intricately carved oak panelling lit by stained glass windows, and has galleried landings whose walls are hung with full-length portraits including works by Michael Dahl and William Dobson. The hall is central and gives access to the elegant drawing room, the blue-and-white ballroom, and the library with bookcases based on the original designs and restored in the on-site workshop. Most of the original bookcases, together with the books, were destroyed in the fire. The wallpaper was based on one of Pugin's designs for the Houses of Parliament and the ceiling has recently been repainted in the original colours. The principal staircase opens off the great hall, under another vaulted ceiling hung with portraits of the Mowbray and Stourton families. The library and dining room occupy the north side of the Hall. The dining room is panelled and has stained glass windows with the arms of the Mowbray and Stourton families. On the huge table, original to the house, are candelabra dating from 1848. The drawing room has a magnificent plaster ceiling. On the walls are portraits by Michael Dahl and Charles Jervas, and vast rococo mirrors, made for Melton Constable Hall in Norfolk. The ballroom, in the west of the house, was left with bare masonry by Lord Mowbray and Stourton, but Dr Rolph has decorated it with a plaster vaulted ceiling. On the entrance-side of the house are the Billiard Room, the Music Room, housing a collection of late-19th and early-20th century automatic musical instruments, and the Morning Room. On a knoll to the west of the house is the \\"Temple of Victory\\", a fine octagonal building of Palladian design. In popular culture The exteriors and interiors were extensively featured in the 1987 telemovie The Sign of Four, a movie-length episode of the Sherlock Holmes series starring Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke. It was the site for several exterior shots of the film The Secret Garden (1993), the house has also been shot in the 2008 film 1920, directed by Indian director Vikram Bhatt, the ITV television series Lost in Austen (2008) as Rosings Park, the Channel 4 TV series Utopia and series 2 of the ITV drama Victoria ReferencesExternal links *Allerton Castle web site Category:Grade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire Category:Royal residences in England Category:Gothic Revival architecture in North Yorkshire Category:Houses completed in 1853 Category:Grade I listed houses Category:Grade I listed castles Category:Country houses in North Yorkshire ","title":"Allerton Castle"},{"id":"2496481","text":"Irish Australians () are an ethnic group of Australian citizens of Irish descent, which include immigrants from and descendants whose ancestry originates from the island of Ireland. Irish Australians have played a considerable part in the history of Australia. They came to Australia from the late eighteenth century as criminals but most were prisoners of war, mainly those who fought in the 1798 Irish rebellion for independence and settlers who could not find a life during the Irish famine and the harsh years in Ireland afterwards. They contributed largely to Australia's development in many different areas. In the late 19th century Irish Australians constituted up to a third of the country's population. There is no definitive figure of the total number of Australians with an Irish background. At the 2011 Australian census, 2,087,800 residents identified themselves as having Irish ancestry either alone or in combination with another ancestry. This nominated ancestry was third behind English and Australian in terms of the largest number of responses and represents 10.4% of the total population of Australia. However this figure does not include Australians with an Irish background who chose to nominate themselves as 'Australian' or other ancestries. The Australian embassy in Dublin states that up to 30% of the population claim some degree of Irish ancestry. HistoryDemographic history= People with Irish ancestry as a percentage of the population in Australia divided geographically by statistical local area, as of the 2011 census Around 40,000 Irish convicts were transported to Australia between 1791 and 1867, including at least 325 who had participated in either the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the rebellion of 1803 or the Young Ireland skirmishes in 1848. Once in Australia, some were involved in the 1804 Castle Hill convict rebellion. Continual tension on Norfolk Island in the same year also led to an Irish revolt. Both risings were soon crushed. As late as the 1860s Fenian prisoners were being transported, particularly to Western Australia, where the Catalpa rescue of Irish radicals off Rockingham was a memorable episode.Bruce Rosen, \\"The 'Catalpa' Rescue\\", Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society 1979 65(2): 73-88, Other than convicts, most of the laborers who voluntarily emigrated to Australia in the 19th century were drawn from the poorest sector of British and Irish society. After 1831, the Australian colonies employed a system of government assistance in which all or most immigration costs were paid for chosen immigrants, and the colonial authorities used these schemes to exercise some control over immigration. While these assisted schemes were biased against the poorest elements of society, the very poor could overcome these hurdles in several ways, such as relying on local assistance or help from relatives. Most Irish emigrants to Australia were free settlers. The 1891 census of Australia counted 228,000 Irish-born. At the time the Irish made up about 27 percent of the immigrants from the British Isles.T. Jordan-Bychkov, Australia, 2009, p. 44 The number of Ireland-born in Australia peaked in 1891. A decade later the number of Ireland-born had dropped to 184,035. Dominion status for the Irish Free State in 1922 did not diminish arrivals from Ireland as Irish people were still British subjects. This changed after the Second World War, as people migrating from the new Republic of Ireland (which came into being in April 1949) were no longer British subjects eligible for the assisted passage. People from Northern Ireland continued to be eligible for this as British citizens. Only during the 1960s did migration from the south of Ireland reduce significantly. By 2002, around one thousand persons born in Ireland -- north and south -- were migrating permanently to Australia each year. For the year 2005-2006, 12,554 Irish entered Australia to work under the Working Holiday visa scheme. Irish and Aboriginal People It has been argued that Irish Australians and Aboriginal people (including those of mixed descent) feel that there is a historical and sentimental link between the two groups. The shared oppression of Aboriginal and Irish people by the British is seen as giving them common historical ground. The historian Patrick O'Farrell argued that (in contrast to other colonists) Irish Catholics treated the Aborigines as equals, as evidenced by their willingness to intermarry, thus giving rise to the Irish surnames prominent among Aboriginal activists.O’Farrell 2001, p. 72 This argument has been questioned. It has been pointed out that under the new colonial and state administrations, a European-style surname was required for official records relating to Aboriginal people. The local police (often of Irish stock) collected the relevant census data and allocated their own names to Aboriginal people for official purposes. In addition, however, many such policemen fathered children to casual or long-term partners from Aboriginal communities. The assumption that the Irish were less violent than other colonists has also been questioned, since Irishmen were among the bushrangers, squatters, police, timber getters and others known for violence against Aborigines. Orphans Over four thousand young female orphans from Irish workhouses were shipped to the Australian colonies at the time of the Great Famine (1848–50) to meet a demand for domestic servants. Some settlers greeted them with hostility and some were exploited or abused by employers and others. Although a number eventually died in poverty, others made upwardly mobile marriages, often surviving older husbands to experience long widowhoods. The Catholic Church only became involved in the 1870s, when its relief agencies in England were overwhelmed with Irish immigration. Even so, only about 10% of the resettlements were through Catholic agencies until after World War II. Australian Catholic groups began importing children in the 1920s to increase the Catholic population, and became heavily engaged in placing and educating them after World War II. The practice quietly died out during the 1950s.Trevor McClaughlin, \\"Lost Children? Irish Famine Orphans in Australia\\", History Ireland 2000 8(4): 30-34,Barry M. Coldrey, \\"Child Migration and the Catholic Church\\", Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society 1993 79(3-4): 199-213 Irish language Queensland Figaro and Punch cover, 16 March 1889, depicting Irish Australians offering enthusiastic support to Parnell's struggle for Home Rule. The first convicts and soldiers to arrive in Australia included a large number of Irish speakers, an example being private Patrick Geary, who in 1808 acted as court interpreter for Patrick Henchan, a convict accused of theft.Hall, p. 238. An account from 1800 refers to convicts speaking Irish among themselves (this being regarded as evidence of conspiracy), and it was acknowledged in the 1820s that priests could not perform their duties in the colony of New South Wales without a knowledge of the language.O’Farrell, p. 27. There is a reference to Irish-speaking bushrangers in Van Diemen's Land in the early nineteenth century.The bushrangers in question were named Scanlan and Brown. A third member of the gang, an Englishman named Richard Lemon, was said to have killed Scanlan because he was tired of hearing him and Brown speaking Irish together. Hughes, p. 227. The gold rushes of the 1850s attracted many Irish to the colony of Victoria, with a high proportion of Irish speakers. An Irish-speaking priest, Fr Stack, was appointed to minister to Irish miners in the gold-rush locality of Bendigo.Noone, p.41. Irish immigration was at its height in the 1860s, the main counties of origin being Clare, Tipperary, Limerick and Kilkenny, all of them areas where the language was still strong.Noone, p. 12. See also the discussion in Fitzgerald regarding the state of Irish in Ireland at the time. Irish continued to be spoken in Australian country districts where the Irish had settled, and there is some evidence of its being transmitted to the next generation.Noone, p. 44.Ó Nuadháin, Val agus Ryan, Colin: 'Nioclás Ó Domhnaill: Laoch na Gaeilge san Astráil' in Feasta, Bealtaine 2009. The Gaelic Revival in Ireland at the end of the nineteenth century found a response in Melbourne and Sydney, with branches of the Gaelic League being established. The 1970s saw a renewal of interest in the language, chiefly among Australians of Irish descent,Noone, pp. 148-163. and there is now a network of Irish speakers in the major cities. The Department of Celtic Studies at the University of Sydney offers courses in Old Irish and Modern Irish, and Newman College (University of Melbourne) houses a collection of books and manuscripts in Irish often used by scholars.The O'Donnell Collection: Australians have published fiction, poetry and journalism in Irish. =Politics= Although Catholic Irish were not generally politically powerful, the large number of Irish combined with universal male suffrage made it possible for Irish to sometimes gain office, such as the Victorian premiers John O'Shanassy (1857, 1858-59, 1861-63) and Charles Gavan Duffy (1871-72). Peter Lalor was the leader of the 1854 Eureka Rebellion, later a conservative member of parliament. Before 1890, Irish Catholics opposed Henry Parkes, the main liberal leader, and free trade, since both represented Protestant, English landholding and wealthy business interests. In the great strike of 1890 Cardinal Moran, the head of the church, was sympathetic toward unions, but Catholic newspapers were critical of organised labour throughout the decade. After 1900, Catholics joined the Labor Party because its stress on equality and social welfare appealed to people who were workers and small farmers. In the 1910 elections Labor gained in areas where the concentration of Catholics was above average, and the number of Catholics in Labor's parliamentary ranks rose.Celia Hamilton, \\"Irish-Catholics of New South Wales and the Labor Party, 1890-1910\\", Historical Studies: Australia & New Zealand 1958 8(31): 254-267 World War I Irish Catholics comprised a quarter of Australia's population in the early 20th century. They were largely working-class and voted for the Labor Party. The referendum on conscription in 1917, following the Easter Uprising in Dublin, caused an identification between the Irish, Sinn Féin, and the anti-conscription section of Labor. Pro-conscription forces exploited this, denouncing outspoken anti-conscription Catholics, such as Archbishop Mannix, and T. J. Ryan, the Premier of Queensland, for disloyalty. In general, Protestants, armed with the authority of tradition, championed the idea of Australia as an integral part of the Empire; and Catholics, freed from that authority by their Irish origins and their working-class affiliations, looked to the future by placing Australia first and the Empire second. There was no simple correlation between Catholicism, Protestantism and conscription, but the idea of an anti-conscription Catholic-Labor alliance stuck for many years.D. J. Murphy, \\"Religion, Race and Conscription in World War I\\", Australian Journal of Politics & History 1974 20(2): 155-163; Alan D. Gilbert, \\"Protestants, Catholics, and Loyalty: an Aspect of the Conscription Controversies, 1916-17\\", Politics 1971 6(1): 15-25, Mid Twentieth-Century Labor Politics The Labor Party remained for many decades close to its working-class Irish Catholic roots. Labor governments were usually dominated by leaders of Irish ancestry, such as Prime Ministers James Scullin (1929-31), John Curtin (1941-45) and Ben Chifley (1945-49) and much later Paul Keating (1991-96). The same was true of many state governments such as the New South Wales administrations led by premiers James McGirr (1947-52), Joseph Cahill (1952-59), and Jack Renshaw (1964-65). All three premiers were of Irish Catholic stock. Conversely, conservative parties contained few Irish Catholics (with the exception of Joseph Lyons, conservative Prime Minister 1932-39; and even Lyons defected from Labor, having been an ALP Premier of Tasmania during the 1920s). Australia thus had political leaders at the highest level of Irish Catholic descent decades before other Anglophone countries such as the United States. Arthur Calwell, minister for immigration in the Chifley government and leader of the federal opposition from 1960 to 1967, strongly identified with his Irish ancestry and learned Gaelic. Status The Irish Australian flag Walker (2007) compares Irish immigrant communities in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Great Britain respecting issues of identity and 'Irishness.' Religion remained the major cause of differentiation in all Irish diaspora communities and had the greatest impact on identity, followed by the nature and difficulty of socioeconomic conditions faced in each new country and the strength of continued social and political links of Irish immigrants and their descendants with the old country. From the late 20th century onward, Irish identity abroad became increasingly cultural, nondenominational, and nonpolitical, but many emigrants from Ulster (and especially from Northern Ireland) stood apart from that trend. For much of the 19th and the 20th centuries, Irish Australians, particularly but not exclusively Catholics, were treated with suspicion in a sectarian atmosphere. The outlaw Ned Kelly (1855–80) achieved the status of a national folk hero; ballads, films and paintings have since 1878 perpetuated the legend. Kelly, who was hanged for murder, is often viewed romantically as the sort of treatment Irish Catholics in Australia could expect. In reality, however, most of the Irish were urban workers who experienced less official discrimination in Australia than they had at home in Ireland, and many Irish Australians (Catholic and Protestant) rose to positions of wealth and power in the colonial hierarchy. Many Irish men, for example, entered law, the judiciary and politics, and in Ned Kelly's time, 80% of the Victorian police were Irish- born, and half of those had served in the Royal Irish Constabulary. In major cities such as Melbourne and Sydney, Irish social and political associations were formed, including the Melbourne Celtic Club, which survives today. The Irish settler in Australia, both voluntary and forced, was crucial to the survival and prosperity of the early colonies both demographically and economically. 300,000 Irish free settlers arrived between 1840 and 1914. By 1871, the Irish were a quarter of all overseas-born. =St. Patrick's Day= O'Farrell (1995) demonstrates the importance of St. Patrick to the Irish, whether northern or republican, Protestant or Catholic, and how Australian manifestations of the Irish festival evolved. St. Patrick's Day became an expression of Irish identity and was emblematic of Irish culture and traditional separatism that migrated with the Irish to Australia. The early immigrants to Australia from Ireland were mainly members of penal colonies; assemblies or any such expression of Irish culture were not permitted. St. Patrick's Day at first was the exception, because it was not highly political, was ecumenical and was subordinate to the wider recognition of Britain. In a series of letters, a P. Cunningham, stated that a St Patrick's Day \\"jubilee\\" Ball was being held in Sydney in 1826.Frank.Crowley,\\"Colonial Australia: A documentary history of Australia 1\\", Thomas Nelson Pty Ltd, Melbourne 1980: 356 The situation changed, however, in the 1830s with the growth of wealthy Irish Catholic emancipists and the introduction of Irish Catholic priests. These factors gave rise to conflicts and tensions that were to remain constant thereafter as the rise and decline of domestic Irish political movements influenced the Irish population in Australia. With the outbreak of World War I, imperatives imposed by the demands of war overshadowed Australian Irish sentiment.Patrick O'Farrell, \\"St Patrick's Day in Australia\\", Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society’‘ 1995 81(1): 1-16 =Orange= The idea of fraternity and how to organise it was one of 19th-century Europe's invisible exports to the New World. Fitzpatrick (2005) explores the international diffusion of the Loyal Orange Institution, with comparative reference to Freemasonry, its main model. Three alternative explanations are discussed for its appeal outside Ireland: that it facilitated the assimilation of emigrants, transmitted 'tribal' Irish animosities to fresh contexts, or adapted itself to preexisting sectarian rivalries abroad. These hypotheses are tested using evidence from South Australia, where Orangeism flourished in the absence of heavy Ulster Protestant immigration. A collective profile of Orange South Australia is derived from lodge records showing age, religious denomination, and occupation, and the appeal of Orangeism is related to local political and religious contexts. In this case, Orangeism was primarily an export of organisational techniques rather than Irish personnel or bigotry.David Fitzpatrick, \\"Exporting Brotherhood: Orangeism in South Australia\\", Immigrants & Minorities 2005 23(2-3): 277-310, 34p. =Catholic clergy and nuns= The Catholic Church in Australia maintained a strong Irish identity, especially in the decades from the 1880s to the 1960s when state aid for church schools was withdrawn and the Church maintained a separate and separately funded school system. The leadership of the Australian Church was almost entirely Irish from 1883 to 1940, prominent Irish-born bishops including Cardinal Moran and Archbishop Kelly in Sydney, Archbishops Carr and Mannix in Melbourne and Archbishop Duhig in Brisbane. Many of the Catholic schools were run and staffed by Irish orders of nuns such as the Sisters of Mercy and Brigidines and Irish orders of brothers such as the Christian Brothers and Patrician Brothers. The Sisters of Charity worked in hospitals. McGrath (1995) demonstrates the success of the Catholic nuns who arrived in Parramatta, New South Wales, from Ireland in 1888, noting their group's growth from nine newcomers into a flourishing congregation of over two hundred women within sixty years. By the 1950s this group of women religious was responsible for 24 primary schools, five secondary schools, and two orphanages. In Australia they carried on the Irish tradition of the Sisters of Mercy and lived a monastic lifestyle. Their sparsely furnished bedrooms were referred to as cells. There was little or no heating. The sisters' spiritual practices reflected the 17th-century school of spirituality. Their relationship to the clergy was one of devotion, dedication, and subordination, thus reflecting the status of women in the larger population. It was societal pressures from without that eventually led to the decline of the Sisters of Mercy as Australia moved into the 1960s. Radical re-evaluations forced a restructuring of the Catholic Church as a whole, and a rethinking of what kinds of service the Church would require in modern times.Sophie McGrath, \\"Women Religious in the History of Australia 1888-1950: a Case Study – the Sisters of Mercy Parramatta\\", Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society 1995 81(2): 195-212 Media The Irish Echo (Australia) is a newspaper available in print and online, covering Irish news and other matters of Irish interest.Irish Echo (Australia's Irish Newspaper): http://www.irishecho.com.au/ Tinteán is an online journal directed chiefly at Irish Australians.

Sports Irish Catholics have been the nation's largest minority throughout most of Australia's history. Their resistance to the elite Anglocentric establishment has keenly marked the development of sport. Mostly working class, the Irish played sports such as rugby league and Australian Rules football, while the Protestant majority often preferred cricket, soccer, rugby union and boxing. The tensions and contrasts between these two sporting cultures eventually built the attitudes and beliefs toward games and sports that Australians share today.Peter A. Horton, \\"The 'Green' and the 'Gold': The Irish-Australians and Their Role in the Emergence of the Australian Sports Culture\\", International Journal of the History of Sport 2000 17(2-3): 65-92 Irish soccer clubs in Australia include: ;Victoria :*St Kilda CeltsOfficial Website of the St Kilda Celts :*Geelong Celtic (defunct) :*Ulsterville (defunct) :*Kew Celtic (defunct) ;New South Wales :*South Lismore Celtic :*Celtic United ;Northern Territory :*Darwin Rovers :*Alice Springs Celtic ;Western Australia :*Shamrock Rovers Perth :*East Perth FC :*Emerald FC :*Celtic Australis FC Perth Lions ;South Australia :*Adelaide Celtic (defunct) Present day At the 2006 Census 50,255 Australian residents declared they were born in the Republic of Ireland and a further 21,291 declared to have been born in Northern Ireland. Cities with the largest Irish-born populations were Sydney (12,730), Melbourne (8,950) and Perth (7,060). At the 2011 Census 2,087,800 Australians (10.4% of the total population) declared they had Irish ancestry either alone or in combination with another ancestry; only Australian and English ancestries were more frequently nominated. According to census data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2004, Irish Australians are, by religion, 46.2% Roman Catholic, 15.3% Anglican, 13.5% other Christian denomination, 3.6% other religions, and 21.5% \\"No Religion\\". Irish Australian settlement patterns are not significantly different from those of the Australian population as a whole -- that is, a third live in New South Wales and a quarter live in Victoria -- except that around 22 per cent live in Queensland (compared to only 18 per cent of the general population). Relatively few as a proportion reside in Western Australia (7.6 per cent of Irish Australians compared to 9.9 per cent of the general population). The 2001 Australian census recorded that persons reporting some Irish Australian ethnicity accounted for 10.7 per cent of all responses in the Australian Capital Territory (42,540 responses), 10.2 per cent in Victoria (469,161 responses), 9.9 per cent in New South Wales (622,944), 9.7 per cent in Queensland (433,354), 7.8 per cent in Tasmania (42,552), 7.6 per cent in Western Australia (171,667), 7.5 per cent in the Northern Territory (18,325) and 6.7 per cent in South Australia (119,063). =Irish language use= In the 2011 Census 1,895 persons were reported as using Irish as a household language, most of them in Sydney and Melbourne.Special Broadcasting Service (SBS): http://www.sbs.com.au/news/census/. Prompts: 'Location,' 'All other languages,' ‘Irish’. This represents an increase from the figure of 918 in the 2006 Census. There are no official statistics regarding the use of Irish outside the home. Popular culture The Australian miniseries and historical drama Against the Wind deals with both the British rule of Ireland, and the development of New South Wales and Australia.

This was in response to a Spanish colonial decree establishing the distribution of Spanish family names and local surnames among colonial subjects who did not have a prior surname. It is also the reason why Filipinos share the same surnames of Spanish people. The book was created after Spanish Governor-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa issued a decree on November 21, 1849, to address the lack of a standard naming convention. Newly-Christianised Filipinos often chose the now-ubiquitous surnames of de los Santos, de la Cruz, del Rosario, and Bautista for religious reasons; others preferred names of well-known local rulers such as Lacandola. To complicate matters further, discrepancies like family members holding different surnames would hinder some of the colonial government's activities such as taking a census and tax collection. Dissemination of surnames According to the decree, a copy of the catalogue, which contains 61,000 surnames, was to be distributed to the provincial heads of the archipelago. From there, a certain number of surnames, based on population, were sent to each barangay's parish priest. The head of each barangay, along with another town official or two, was present when the father or the oldest person in each family chose a surname for his or her family. A surname is only given to one family per municipality reducing any issues about surnames being associated with an ethnic background or group affiliation. The dissemination of surnames were also based on the recipient family's origins. For example, surnames starting with \\"A\\" were distributed to provincial capitals. \\"B\\" surnames were given to secondary towns while tertiary towns received \\"C\\" surnames. Families were awarded with the surnames or asked to choose from them. However, several groups were exempt from having to choose new surnames: *Those possessing a previously adopted surname (whether indigenous or foreign) already on the list; or, if not on the list, not prohibited due to ethnic origin or being too common. *Families who had already adopted a prohibited surname but could prove their family had used the name for at least four consecutive generations. (These were names prohibited for being too common, like de los Santos, de la Cruz, or for other reasons.) Spanish names are the majority found in the books' list of legitimate surnames. Because of the mass implementation of Spanish surnames in the Philippines, a Spanish surname does not indicate Spanish ancestry and can make it difficult for Filipinos to accurately trace their lineage.

The most common device is a handheld, battery-operated device pressed against the skin under the mandible which produces vibrations to allow speech; other variations include a device similar to the \\"talk box\\" electronic music device, which delivers the basis of the speech sound via a tube placed in the mouth. Earlier non-electric devices were called mechanical larynxes. Along with developing esophageal voice, using a speech synthesizer, or undergoing a surgical procedure, the electrolarynx serves as a mode of speech recovery for laryngectomy patients. The Voice Quality Symbol for electrolaryngeal phonation in speech is И, approximating the symbol for electricity. Overview Initially, the pneumatic mechanical larynx was developed in the 1920s by Western Electric. It did not run on electricity, and was flawed in that it produced a strong voice. Electrolarynxes were introduced in the 1940s, at a time when esophageal speech was being promoted as the best course in speech recovery; however, since that technique is difficult to master, the electrolarynx became quite popular. Since then, medical procedures, such as the tracheo-oesophageal puncture, and the rarely performed laryngeal transplantation surgery, have been created to enable speech without continued dependence on a handheld device. The use of an electrolarynx can cause social issues, for instance difficulty ordering food, drinks, or other items in noisy environments; or, when answering a telephone, having the caller respond, \\"Am I talking to a computer?\\" However, quality-of-life improvements due to electrolarynx usage are generally significant. One user states: Traditional electrolarynxes produce a monotone buzz that the user articulates into speech sounds, resulting in the characteristic \\"robotlike\\" voice quality. However, in the 1990s, research and commercial multi-tone devices began to be developed, including discrete-tone devices using multiple-position switches or multiple buttons; as well as variable-tone devices controlled by single pressure- sensitive buttons, trackballs, gyroscopes, touchpad-like input devices, or even electrical detection of the movement of neck muscles. In addition to allowing speakers of non-tonal languages such as English to have a more natural speaking voice, some of these newer devices have allowed speakers of tonal languages such as Mandarin Chinese to speak more intelligibly. Notable fictional users Fictional characters notable for their use of an electrolarynx include: * Agents of \\"Leviathan\\" on Agent Carter * Charlie in Mad Max * Electrolarynx Guy (Jack Axelrod) on My Name Is Earl * Emilio Sanchez, one of the residents of the Lawrence Hilton Jacobs housing project on The PJs * Gray Baker in Dead Again * Heathrow, Madea's brother in Tyler Perry's A Madea Family Funeral * Komtuan, the crime lord from the film Ong- Bak: Muay Thai Warrior, notable as a speaker of a tonal language being understood despite using a traditional monotone electrolarynx * Ned Gerblansky on South Park * Sawyer the Cleaner from Black Lagoon * Sheriff Jerry/Angela Baker in Return to Sleepaway Camp * Smokie Martling, a parody of Jackie Martling from The Howard Stern Show * The Smoking Family from Chewin' The Fat * Stemroach (David Bradley) on Ideal * WWE wrestler Kane, for his first two years in the company (1998–1999) * Zimos from Saints Row The Third See also * Esophageal speech * * Silent speech interface References Category:Laryngology Category:Human voice ","title":"Electrolarynx"},{"id":"2496516","text":"Coppins is a country house north of the village of Iver in Buckinghamshire, England, formerly a home of members of the British Royal Family, including Princess Victoria, Prince George, Duke of Kent, Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent and Prince Edward, Duke of Kent (their son). History The house was originally a mid-nineteenth century farmhouse built by John Mitchell, who arranged Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales' theatre visits. The house was substantially altered for Princess Victoria, who moved there after the death in 1925 of her mother Queen Alexandra. Princess Victoria left Coppins to her nephew Prince George, the Duke of Kent, when she died in 1935. From then until it was sold in 1972 to Commander Eli Gottlieb, it was the home of two generations of the Kent family. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was a regular visitor to Coppins during school holidays while at Gordonstoun, 1937-9, and Dartmouth Naval College, 1939–40, and later when visiting with the Princess Elizabeth. Prince George’s wife, Princess Marina, was Prince Philip’s paternal first cousin. Prince Michael of Kent was born there on 4 July 1942. In 1944, Princess Marina's first cousin George II of Greece, also stayed at Coppins.

As a judge in the newly created divorce court, Cresswell did much to start the emergence of modern family law by setting divorce on a secular footing, removed from the traditional domain of canon law. Family Born at Bigg Market, Newcastle, Cresswell's father was Francis Easterby (died 1834), a merchant and sailor. His mother was Frances Dorothea née Cresswell (1768–1832), daughter of a distinguished northern family that could trace its ancestry back to the twelfth century and service in the Crusades.Getzler (2004) The family owned land in Northumberland and were scions of the Cresswells of Bibury, Sidbury and Sherston Pinkney, ancestors of Edward I. Francis adopted the name Cresswell in 1807 when his wife inherited much of the ancestral wealth. His brother Addison was the Tory MP for North Northumberland between 1841 and 1857. Education Cresswell was educated at Charterhouse School, where he was a contemporary of Connop Thirlwall, George Grote and Henry Havelock. He attended Trinity and then Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where William Henry Maule was his tutor. Graduating BA in 1814, he received the lowest place in the honours list of the entire university. Nonetheless, he was awarded an MA in 1818 and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1819. Early career Cresswell began his practice on the northern circuit and fell under the guidance and mentorship of Henry Brougham. Cresswell found his familiarity with his father's nautical career an advantage in the maritime city of Liverpool and he soon established a reputation in commercial and shipping cases. From 1822 to 1830 he was co-author, with Richard Barnewall, of a well- received series of law reports. From the 1820s, Brougham's and James Scarlett's energies were directed elsewhere and Cresswell became a leader of the northern circuit, being made recorder of Hull in 1830. In 1834 he was made KC and the same year became Attorney General for the County Palatine of Durham. Cresswell had gained a reputation as a \\"violent Tory\\" but was elected as Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Liverpool in the 1837 United Kingdom general election and again in 1841 when he defeated William Ewart. Cresswell was knighted in 1842. A dedicated party-man who loyally followed Sir Robert Peel, Cresswell made little contribution to parliamentary debate. He resigned his parliamentary seat in 1842 when he was made a judge of the Court of Common Pleas by Peel, being knighted at the same time. Cresswell's contributions to the common law were modest. He was a cautious judge, somewhat in awe of chief justice Tindal, and was all too willing to concur rather than to take the lead. In 1856 Cresswell sat in the Swynfen will case, the case of a contested will that generated extensive satellite litigation including a claim that the plaintiff's counsel, Sir Frederic Thesiger, had been guilty of malpractice in agreeing a settlement without authority. It was further alleged that Cresswell had induced the agreement by suggesting to Thesiger at an early stage that he had formed an unfavourable view of his client's case. At Thesiger's trial, counsel Charles Rann Kennedy described Cresswell's behaviour as being of a \\"highly criminal nature\\" amounting to a \\"fraud\\" and a \\"misdemeanour\\". Cresswell admitted having shared his impressions with Thesiger saying, \\"If any gentleman had asked me a question about [the trial] I should have answered him\\", sharing his adverse opinion. While this case raised some negative publicity, no legal action was taken against Cresswell. The divorce court In 1858 he was named the first divorce judge-in-ordinary of the new Probate, Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Court which replaced the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts and created the remedy of civil divorce. He was reputedly offered a peerage at the time but declined. He did, however, become a privy councillor. Appointed with bipartisan support, such was the sensitivity of the office, there was some disquiet that a notoriously bad- tempered, confirmed bachelor had been appointed in such a role but Cresswell succeeded superbly in establishing tone, procedure and practice. The new law increased petitions for divorce one hundredfold and there were fears of chaos but Cresswell took a managerial role in regulating the new flood of litigation. He showed great sensitivity in dealing with genuine grievances but upheld the sanctity of marriage and was capable of being severe when necessary. However, he was also instrumental in moving the legal view of marriage from that based on a sacrament to that based on contract. He worked with colossal speed and energy, deciding over one thousand cases in six years, only one of which was reversed on appeal. He achieved some public fame and huge respect popularly being held as representing the five million married women of Britain. His activities in this field are referred to in Anthony Trollope's Framley Parsonage; \\"most marriages are fairly happy, in spite of Sir Cresswell Cresswell\\". Death Cresswell died in office, from complications after a fall from his horse in London, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. He was unmarried and had no children so he left his considerable fortune of £35,000 (£2.8 million at 2003 prices) to charity. References * Bibliography *, 9.184–7 *Getzler, J. S.

Euthanasia The more common form is assisted suicide, in which terminally ill people seek assistance from their doctors (or family members) to alleviate their suffering by ending their lives. This practice is legal in some jurisdictions, but remains controversial because of the legal, ethical and practical issues it raises. Dr. Jack Kevorkian was the most well-known advocate of this practice.Betzold, Michel,\\"Appointment with Doctor Death\\" Troy, MI: Momentum Books 1996 Another notable case is suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams, who claimed that patient Edith Alice Morrell—for whose murder he was tried in 1957—had wanted to die. He was controversially found not guilty but later suspected of murdering up to 163 of his patients.Cullen, Pamela V., \\"A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams\\", London, Elliott & Thompson, 2006, Attempts to legalize assisted suicide in various US states have generally failed in recent years. Washington state is a notable exception. Washington legalized assisted suicide with a law that took effect March 4, 2009, becoming the second state, after Oregon, to have done so. California, on the other hand, rejected the practice in 1992, 1999, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Furthermore, Massachusetts had also rejected the practice in 2012. Opposition to assisted suicide legalization came from a wide range of organizations including the California Medical Association, disability rights organizations, faith-based organizations, and Latino and civil rights groups. Exceptional cases In 1996 a Maryland entrepreneur named Sharon Lopatka arranged for her own torture and strangulation over the Internet. In 2001, Armin Meiwes from Germany was found to have murdered and cannibalized a willing victim he found over the internet. These two cases attracted considerable media attention. Beyond their lurid sexual details, both cases introduce paradoxes about the respective responsibility of the parties, the legal differences between consensual homicide and suicide. In 2005, Japan, Hiroshi Maeue lured three people via the internet with promises to assist in their suicides, and strangled them. They may have consented to their killings at first, but the method was different from his promise of death by carbon monoxide poisoning. Maeue had previous convictions and his motivation was clearly sexual. He was regarded as a serial killer and was sentenced to death. In the evening of April 25, 2012, a 25-year-old woman by the name of Jessica Hanley had a friend, Tashina Sutherland, come over to her boyfriend’s house in Surrey, British Columbia. Throughout the night, the two women drank alcohol and snorted cocaine excessively. By the end of the bender, the women decided to partake in a suicide pact. When the time came, Hanley began to have second thoughts. After realizing how upset this made Sutherland, she eventually complied by stabbing Sutherland 41 times throughout her body with a boning knife and a bayonet. Hanley would then place Sutherland’s body in the bathtub. While trying to think of ways to dispose of the body, Hanley decided to call her boyfriend and tell him what has transpired. He immediately returned home. Once he saw the body, he told Hanley to leave and then proceeded to call the police. After leaving her boyfriend’s house, Hanley decided to go to her father’s house, who was in walking distance. After telling her father what happened, he drove her to the police station where she turned herself in. Hanley was eventually charged with manslaughter and was sentenced with 7 years and 9 months in prison. During the trial, it was discovered that Sutherland had written a note to her family some time before her murder occurred, which said, “Look up at the sky and remember me on the day I died.” This was taken as evidence that Sutherland had been planning on dying before she asked Hanley to agree to a suicide pact. A twenty-six-year-old mother of three from Columbus, Ohio by the name of Chelsea Martinez was reported missing by her husband on August 1, 2015. Not long after making the report, he discovered that she spent much of her time chatting on an online forum called the Experience Project. Amongst that discovery, Martinez’s husband found an unsettling conversation between Martinez and another user, who went by the alias of “DarkRyd3r”. She confided in the stranger by telling him that she had been wanting to die for a long time but was too scared to follow through with it herself. Eventually, they discussed the process in which he will kill her. Martinez would then thank him for finally putting her mind at peace. Her car was soon recovered by police in Faribault, Minnesota 700 miles away, an 11.5-hour drive, away from her home. The police discovered that she drove to a motel in Faribault to meet “DarkRyd3r”, who was found to be 39-year-old Jason Nisbit. The next day, they left the motel separately and would meet again at a nearby park. Nisbit then tied her up, strangled her until she was unconscious, and slit the throat of Martinez with a 10-inch knife. After Martinez took her final breath, Nisbit buried her in a shallow grave partially. Nisbit was subsequently charged with second degree murder. Martinez’s family later remarked that she had a history of having suicidal thoughts and tendencies along with recurring mental health issues.  Other types  * Seppuku, the traditional Japanese method of suicide, in many cases works as consensual homicide. The assistant, called a kaishakunin, performs a mercy kill on the samurai committing suicide. If the assistant is not present, the ritual can devolve into a slow, messy death.  In popular culture  Consensual mutual homicide of a male-female couple is the theme of Pedro Almodóvar's movie Matador. The word \\"matador\\" is traditionally used for bullfighters (also a theme of the movie), but literally means \\"killer\\". Consensual homicide is also a theme in the 2009 novel Dark Places, written by Gillian Flynn.

He had a successful stage and film career before World War II. For much of his later career Knight was half blind. He had been badly injured in 1941 whilst on active service on board HMS Prince of Wales when she fought the Bismarck at the Battle of the Denmark Strait, and remained totally blind for two years, though he later regained some sight in his right eye. Early career He was an accomplished actor with a career spanning over half a century. He established himself in the 1920s on stage. In John Gielgud's famous 1930 production of Hamlet he played Rosencrantz. He also appeared in films. In Romany Love (1931) he played \\"a swaggering gypsy who never stopped singing.\\" For The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933), Knight and his uncle C.W.R. Knight trained the falcons used in the hunting scenes. In Alfred Hitchcock's Waltzes from Vienna (1934), he played the lead role as Johann Strauss. Following this, he landed a number of roles in Hollywood films. He travelled to Germany to star in Schwarze Rosen (1937), a film about a Finnish anti-communist. The film was shot in three versions, in English, German and French. Julius Streicher visited the set during filming. Thereafter Knight appeared in various film and theatre productions in Britain. Military service After war was declared, Knight continued to act, appearing in Powell and Pressburger's film Contraband (1940).BFI He sought a naval commission, but after the evacuation of Dunkirk he became involved in training Local Defence Volunteers. In late 1940 he was accepted for naval training. In 1941 Knight was asked to play the lead role of fanatical Nazi Lieutenant Hirth in another Powell and Pressburger propaganda film 49th Parallel (1941), but Eric Portman took the role as Knight was required for military training. He did appear in This England (also 1941), another propaganda film. After completing his Naval training, Knight was appointed as Gunnery Officer, with the rank of lieutenant, on the battleship HMS Prince of Wales. In 1941, the ship received orders to pursue the German battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen. In the ensuing Battle of the Denmark Strait, Knight witnessed the sinking of HMS Hood before being blinded by shrapnel. A shell fired by Bismarck either passed through the bridge of the Prince of Wales and did not explode or it exploded near the ship. Either way fragments from the ship's superstructure hit Knight in the face causing him to lose an eye and leaving the other severely damaged. = Recuperation= Though blind, Knight insisted that he would continue his acting career. During this period, he dictated an early autobiography to his secretary, Annabella Cloudsley, Seeking the Bubble (Hutchinson & Co. 1943).http://www.esmondknight.org.uk/hislife10.htm Knight continued to act in radio productions. Though still totally blind, he also appeared on film, once more as a Nazi villain, in Powell and Pressburger's The Silver Fleet (1943). During 1943, Knight received a series of treatments from Dr Vincent Nesfield designed to restore sight to his remaining eye. The treatment was a great success, restoring much of Knight's sight. The partial return of his sight made a major difference to his career. He appeared briefly in another Powell and Pressburger film, playing the roles of the village idiot and the \\"Seven Sisters Soldier\\" in A Canterbury Tale (1944), also adding the voice-over reading of Chaucer. His major breakthrough back into the mainstream came when he was cast as Fluellen, the brave but eccentric Welsh officer in Laurence Olivier's version of Henry V (1944). Later career Knight continued to work with Olivier and with Powell and Pressburger, appearing in the former's Shakespearean films Hamlet (1948) and Richard III (1955). For the latter, he appeared in Black Narcissus (1947) and The Red Shoes (1948). He also starred in Jean Renoir's The River (1951). Knight was the subject of a This Is Your Life episode in 1957 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the King's Theatre in Hammersmith, London. In the film Sink the Bismarck! (1960), he played John Leach, the captain of HMS Prince of Wales, the ship he had served in when he was blinded (though the captain is not named in the film). In the same year he played Jack Cade in the BBC Shakespeare series An Age of Kings. He starred as Professor Ernest Reinhart in the British science fiction television series A for Andromeda (1961), alongside Patricia Kneale and Peter Halliday. In Robin and Marian (1976), a film directed by Richard Lester, he played a blind old man who defies Richard I of England. For the role, Knight removed his glass eye. Personal life Knight was married twice. He married actress Frances Clare in 1929. The couple had a daughter, actress Rosalind Knight. During the 1930s, he had a long-running affair with Nora Swinburne, of which his wife was aware. She was also an actress who appeared with him in several stage plays. After a short-lived attempt to end the affair, Knight left Frances for Nora. The couple married in 1946 and remained together until his death. Death Knight died of a heart attack in London on 23 February 1987.

Membership Committee dated 20 Nov 1990, originals on file at VFP National Office VFP's first permanent representative to the United Nations was Benjamin Weintraub of Staten Island, New York, who was seated in 1990.Veterans for Peace: The First Decade, p. 138 Chapters and members are active in communities throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and Viet Nam. National conventions are held annually and members communicate through quarterly newsletters as well as daily list-serve news, online discussion groups as well as the national and chapter websites. Veterans for Peace has a national office in Saint Louis, Missouri and members across the country, both organized in chapters and at-large. At least one unrelated anti-war group from the Vietnam War era had a similar name: \\"Veterans for Peace in Viet-Nam\\" participated in a number of demonstrations in 1967. And another demonstration in Washington, DC. Yet another group with a similar name may also have existed at the time of the Korean War. Anti-war activities Crawford, Texas, August, 2005 VFP first began organizing major anti-war protests in 1987 when, on Easter Sunday, hundreds of VFP members marched on President Reagan's Western White House in California, and Vice President Bush's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, protesting U.S. support for the Nicaraguan Contra counter-revolution.Veterans for Peace: The First Decade p. 78 Starting in 2003, Veterans for Peace became a major participant of protests against the Iraq War. In 2004, a Southern California chapters of Veterans For Peace began installing Arlington West, a weekly \\"temporary cemetery\\" in tribute to those killed in the war in Iraq, each Sunday in Santa Barbara and Santa Monica, California. In August 2005, Veterans For Peace Member, Desert storm veteran Dennis Kyne lead a group of veterans in support of Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a US Army soldier killed in Iraq who embarked on an extended anti-war vigil near the ranch of US President George W. Bush in Crawford, Texas. On August 5, 2005 Cindy spoke at the organization's 20th annual convention in Dallas, Texas, just a day before traveling to Crawford to begin her vigil. Members traveled from California to install an Arlington West display at \\"Camp Casey,\\" the site of Sheehan's protest. In March 2006, Veterans For Peace and coalition partners Iraq Veterans Against the War, Gold Star Families for Peace, and Military Families Speak Out joined with Hurricane Katrina survivors and the relief and rebuilding organizations Savin' Ourselves After Katrina, Common Ground Collective, and Bayou Liberty Relief, as well as a number of African-American churches along the Gulf Coast on a march from Mobile, Alabama to New Orleans, Louisiana. Originally titled the Veterans and Survivors March, it quickly took on the moniker of Walkin' to New Orleans, in tribute to the famous song by Fats Domino. The marchers traveled the Gulf Coast advocating an immediate end to the war in Iraq and redirection of funds to help rebuild areas Katrina damaged not only in New Orleans, but also in Mississippi, and Alabama. The march and the events surrounding it have inspired a plethora of websites and images on the web. According to Vets for Peace - Peace Action Network, \\"The military has a clear and dangerous presence at Milwaukee's Summerfest\\" (June 26 - July 6, 2008). \\"One exhibit is especially offensive: kids as young as 13 years old can aim automatic weapons from atop a humvee at a large screen to virtually kill people.\\" Veterans for Peace participated in an anti-war demonstration held on the White House sidewalk in December 2010; dozens of demonstrators were arrested, including Ray McGovern, Daniel Ellsberg, Chris Hedges and a number of Veterans for Peace members.The Real News (TRNN) In 2016, the US Peace Memorial Foundation awarded the US Peace Prize to Veterans For Peace “In recognition of heroic efforts to expose the causes and costs of war and to prevent and end armed conflict.” Issues Veterans for Peace takes positions on a number of issues which generally oppose the military policy of the United States, NATO and its allies against nations such as Iran, Russia, Palestine and Syria. =War against Iran= VFP President Leah Bolger stated they and other peace organizations oppose a military attack against Iran in an interview cited by Iran's PressTV news agency. VFP agrees with the Iranian complaint that NATO seeks to \\"surround and threaten the nation of Iran\\". VFP has stated \\"Iran does not have a nuclear bomb. The U.S. intelligence agencies unanimously confirm this and say that Iran has not made the decision to build a nuclear weapon. Yet Iran has three neighbors that possess nuclear arsenals—India, Israel, and Pakistan.\\" VFP endorsed United for Peace and Justice position against a War against Iran. =War in Iraq= When the U.S. government threatened invasion, VFP conducted public forums, met with elected representatives and participated in marches to express its opposition. As the war began, VFP gathered in Washington, DC, with other veterans groups for Operation Dire Distress. The organization participated in the Bring Them Home Now campaign and supports the Iraq Veterans Against the War. Local chapters continue to conduct educational forums, demonstrations, and ongoing Iraq memorial displays such as Arlington West (portrayed in the documentary Arlington West: The Film) to remember the growing human cost of the war, to end the occupation, and to bring U.S. troops home. VFP Chapter 14 in Gainesville, Florida has for the last eight years installed it display of small headstone replicas along a one-mile stretch of road in town which they call the Memorial Mile. rows of 4 \\"tombstones\\" and columns of about 1 1/2 mile long represent every man or woman killed since the beginning of war in Afghanistan to the very day of installation. Every single marker can be located for a friend or loved one to visit, and often remembrances or flowers are left by friends and relatives. From Sat. Morning to Monday evening on Memorial Day weekend VFP members and volunteers guard the memorial in shifts. The community has welcomed this tribute to the fallen service men and women and Chapter 14 continues to do this until all the troops come home. =Humanitarian intervention in Syria and Libya= VFP opposed military “humanitarian intervention” in Libya and in Syria as \\"opposition to all war is the official position of VFP because we know that peace cannot be realized by waging war.\\" =Veterans affairs= Members and chapters actively participate in efforts to save VA healthcare and defend veterans rights; to provide counseling through the GI Rights Hotline to active duty military needing assistance; and providing alternative information to counter military recruiters in the schools. =Patriot Act= Veterans For Peace seeks to protect civil liberties that they believe are threatened by the Patriot Act and other similar legislation. =Drones= Veterans For Peace joined Code Pink, World Can't Wait and Afghans For Peace to protest Drones in Chicago in 2012.Veterans Protest Against NATO and Drones in Chicago, May 18, 2012 On their national calendar, April 2013 was marked as the \\"No Drone\\" action month. Chapters across the nation held actions, protesting the use of drones. =NATO= VFP has called for the dissolution of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a \\"NATO has always been a war-making institution lacking in accountability to the peoples of the nations it claims to represent.\\" VFP states that NATO has waged wars of aggression against Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. VFP states that NATO maintains nuclear weapons in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. They back Russia's protest that Russia is threatened by missile base construction on its borders. VFP cites Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Mubarak as examples where NATO did not address human rights abuses by dictators who supported NATO, and charges that NATO supports \\"Israel's expansionist agenda\\". =War on Terror= In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, VFP called for restraint while agreeing that: \\"...the hijacked airplane attacks on the World Trade Towers and the Pentagon a grievous assault upon innocence; a cause for outrage, sadness and disbelief....At this critical point, we believe it is essential to recognize that terrorists do not represent, nor are representative, of any community or country as a whole. We must not allow terrorism the power to create fear, suspicion and hatred -- or to direct our nation's domestic and foreign policies. We must not surrender to the cycle of retaliatory violence these angry people would push us into. Instead, we must come together and support each other, with faith and trust.\\" =Impeachment of George W. Bush= VFP called for the impeachment of President Bush. In a letter sent to each member of the U.S. House and Senate, Veterans For Peace stated that \\"this administration's war on Iraq, in addition to being increasingly unpopular among Americans, is an unmistakable violation of our Constitution and federal law which you have sworn to uphold. In our system, the remedy for such high crimes is clear: this administration must be impeached.\\" =Agent Orange= VFP works with other Vietnam veterans, Vietnamese-Americans, and the Vietnam Agent Orange Relief and Responsibility Campaign (VAORRC) to secure justice and compensation for the estimated 3 million Vietnamese whose health has been damaged by the 19 million gallons of dioxin-contaminated Agent Orange and other herbicides that were sprayed over more than 1/8 of the land of southern Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia during the American portion of the Vietnam War. In 2005, the Vietnamese Association of Victims of Agent Orange/Dioxin (VAVA)http://www.vava.org.vn/ sued 36 U.S. chemical companies for supplying the dioxin-laced herbicides to the Department of Defense. The suit was dismissed in Federal District court in 2007 and the reinstatement appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was unsuccessful. The Supreme Court refused to hear this case and cases brought by US Vietnam War veterans in 2009. Subsequently, VAORRC and VFP helped draft legislation to address the main unresolved issued surrounding the use of Agent Orange herbicides in Vietnam. An initial bill was introduced in 2011. It was reintroduced in slightly modified form in 2013 as H.R. 2519 Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2013. The bill will be reintroduced in the 114th Congress in early in 2015. The 2013 bill includes five elements: 1) Environmental cleanup in Vietnam; 2) Assistance to Vietnamese affected by AO; 3) Assistance to the children of US Vietnam War veterans; 4) Assistance to the Vietnamese Americans affected by AO; and 5) Comprehensive research to answer numerous remaining medical questions about the damage AO does to people. VFP supports this activity because it wishes to promote reconciliation and friendship between the United States and Vietnam governments and people, educate the American people about the true costs of war, and help heal the wounds of war. =School of the Americas= Each year VFP members from across the country go to Fort Benning, Georgia, to demonstrate for the closing of the Army's controversial School of the Americas, a training center for thousands of soldiers from Latin American countries which VFP identifies as having \\"long records of human rights abuses.\\" =Korea= After revelations of the massacres of civilians by U.S. soldiers during the Korean War, VFP sent several fact-finding delegations to investigate these allegations and bring the hidden history of that war before the public. They continue to work for an end to that conflict through their Korea Peace Campaign. =Vieques= The VFP has actively supported the end of the U.S. Navy's use of the island- municipality of Vieques, Puerto Rico for bombing target practice. VFP continues to support current efforts for cleaning up the environment. =Colombia= VFP sent fact-finding delegations to Colombia and educated Americans about US military involvement, the murder of union leaders by para- militaries and other human rights abuses, including the use of harmful chemical defoliants in the War on Drugs. =Central America= Veterans for Peace members at January 2009 protest vs. Israeli attacks on Gaza In the 1980s, VFP opposed US-sponsored wars in Central America. On Easter Sunday, Apr 19, 1987, VFP members marched on President Reagan's Western White House in California, and Vice President Bush's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, protesting U.S. intervention in Central America. From May 4–18, 1987, sixteen members of VFP representing eight states traveled through Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua conducting site visits and interviews with high level government, military, religious and private sector elders, and talking with many average citizens. Following their return, they published a 40-page delegation report that was distributed to 5,000 opinion leaders in the United States including members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, the heads of many government offices and agencies, church, labor, and educational leaders, and media pace setters.Veterans for Peace: The First Decade, pp. 61-76 In 1988, many VFP members participated in the Veterans Peace Convoy which was intended to truck medical and humanitarian aid to the suffering children of Nicaragua. Though the convoy was stopped by U.S. Customs and Treasury officials in Texas at the Laredo border checkpoint, on June 15, 1988, the vehicles were off-loaded into containers at a Texas port facility and about 95% of the cargo reached its destination in Nicaragua.Veterans for Peace: The First Decade pp. 81-82 In July 1988, VFP member Joe Ryan, an environmental scientist, of Tallahassee, Florida, established VFP's Nicaragua Environmental Science Project. Ryan spent two years working in Nicaragua training pollution control teams how to correct water contamination problems. The project was credited with significantly reducing the nation's infant mortality rate.Veterans for Peace: The First Decade pp. 83-84 Also in July 1988, VFP member Randy Parent of Caribou, Maine, drove a truckload of smelting and casting equipment to Guatemala where he established the Pro-Tierra Machine Tool Project to train members of several indigenous tribes how to make farm tools for the 100,000 members of the Pro-Tierra land reform movement.Veterans for Peace: The First Decade pp. 84-85 VFP regularly sends election observers to Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. =Bosnia= The most recent war in the Balkans began in 1991 when the Republics of Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence from Yugoslavia following the death of Marshal Josip Broz Tito. The Republic of Bosnia & Herzegovina followed suit and within a year it was announced the hospitals in several cities were no longer functional, and thousands of refugees had fled to the mountains. As the refugees were ill-equipped to face the coming winter, many were expected to perish. VFP's UN-NGO representative Ben Weintraub was instructed to offer U.N. officials whatever assistance VFP could provide in helping to deliver medical and humanitarian aid. Following discussions with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), another UN-NGO, the VFP National Office began contacting hospitals around the U.S. requesting pro bono services for any war wounded children that could be evacuated. Within weeks VFP had secured pro bono space and services for over 100 wounded children, but IOM had been able to evacuate very few due, unfortunately, to Serbian, Croatian, and U.N. political constraints. In response, VFP organized the Children of War Rescue Project and with assistance from contacts in the U.K., chief among them, Dr. John Morrison of the Ex-Services Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and over 200 other British volunteers, a 63 vehicle convoy including 50 ambulances was staged at Brighton, England. Seven VFP volunteers including three physicians also joined the convoy that traveled almost non-stop for five days and nights. The convoy stopped only to regroup in Croatia. A Spanish battalion of U.N. protection forces assisted with armored vehicles in the evacuation of over 22 wounded children from East Mostar, Bosnia, including at least one family member accompanying each child. The children were airlifted to Ancona, Italy, and once stabilized, from there to hospitals throughout western Europe and the United States. In all, pro bono space and medical services were provided for about 50 wounded Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian children through VFP's Children of War Rescue Project.Veterans for Peace: The First Decade pp. 154-222 =Israel-Palestine= Veterans For Peace issued a statement on Israel's 2006 invasion of Lebanon condemning the targeting of civilians by both sides and the \\"unjustified and totally disproportionate use of force and violence by the IDF (Israel Defense Forces).\\"Veterans For Peace Statement on the Fighting in Lebanon-Gaza-Israel , on United for Peace and Justice web site, July 31st, 2006. In 2009 it issued a statement against Israel's attacks on Gaza condemning attacks on civilians both sides and stating \\"Bombings, rocket attacks, blockading medical supplies and military invasions will not lead to peace and security but will perpetuate the cycle of death, destruction, fear and insecurity among the people of all countries, including the U.S.\\"National VFP Statement on Crisis in Gaza , Veterans for Peace web site, January 7, 2009. VFP was a sponsor for the Boston March for Palestine which demanded to \\"Free Palestine! No war on Iran or Syria! and Boycott Israel!\\" along with the Boston Coalition for Palestinian Rights and the Palestine Task Force of United for Justice with Peace. Members of the Palestine Working Group support remembrance of Al Nakba, and have made visits to Gaza and participated in \\"efforts to break the blockade of essential supplies to the area, including the Gaza Flotilla\\". Government monitoring and infiltration According to FOIA documents obtained by the ACLU in 2006, VFP was among the peace groups targeted by FBI monitoring and infiltration by the FBI and local law enforcement terrorism task forces that targeted environmental, anti-war and faith-based groups.

Its area is about . To its north is the river Loire, to its south the river Cher, while the districts of Sancerre and Berry are to its east. Its name is thought to derive either from the Latin sœcalonia (\\"rye country\\") or sabulonia (\\"sandy country\\"). Geography The Sologne is watered by the Cosson and the Beuvron, tributaries of the Loire, and the Sauldre, a tributary of the Cher, all three having a west-south-westerly direction. The pools and marshes which are characteristic of the region are due to the impermeability of its soil, which is a mixture of sand and clay. The main towns of Sologne are: * Orléans (the most southern part of the city (La Source) and the university have been built in the woods of Sologne) * Romorantin-Lanthenay (which hosts the Museum of Sologne) * La Ferté-Saint-Aubin * Salbris * Lamotte-Beuvron * Aubigny-sur- Nère History In the middle of the 19th century Napoleon III led the way in the reclamation of swamps, the planting of pines and other trees and other improvements. Arable farming and stock-raising are fairly flourishing in the Sologne, but there is little manufacturing activity, the cloth manufacture of Romorantin being the chief industry. Game is abundant, and the region owes much of its revived prosperity to the creation of large sporting estates. Cultural references In the early 18th century, Jean-Philippe Rameau composed a famous harpsichord piece, Les Niais de Sologne, whose name translates as \\"the simpletons of Sologne\\". The form is a rondo with two episodes that are variations on the main section. Despite the title (which may allude to the meandering melody throughout), its use of ornamentation denotes a work of great subtlety and sophistication. The book Le Grand Meaulnes by Alain-Fournier is set in the region of Sologne and mentions several places, such as Bourges, Vierzon and the Cher. It is somewhere in this region where Meaulnes becomes lost and stumbles across the mysterious estate. Many stories and essays of Maurice Genevoix are set in Sologne. =UN World Heritage Site= The Chateau de Chambord is situated in the region.

Its source is the confluence of the Georges River at Taren Point and the Cooks River at Kyeemagh, which flows to the east before meeting its mouth at the Tasman Sea, midpoint between the suburbs of La Perouse and Kurnell. The northern headland of the entrance to the bay from the Tasman Sea is Cape Banks and, on the southern side, the outer headland is Cape Solander and the inner headland is Sutherland Point. The total catchment area of the bay is approximately . Despite its relative shallowness, the bay now serves as greater metropolitan Sydney's main cargo seaport, located at Port Botany, with facilities managed by Sydney Ports Corporation. Two runways of Sydney Airport extend into the bay, as do some port facilities. Botany Bay National Park is located on the northern and southern headlands of the bay. The area surrounding the bay is generally managed by Roads and Maritime Services. The land adjacent to Botany Bay was settled for many thousands of years by the Tharawal and Eora peoples and their associated clans. On 29 April 1770, Botany Bay was the site of James Cook's first landing of HMS Endeavour on the land mass of Australia, after his extensive navigation of New Zealand. Later the British planned Botany Bay as the site for a penal colony. Out of these plans came the first European habitation of Australia at Sydney Cove. Although the penal settlement was almost immediately shifted to Sydney Cove, for some time in Britain transportation to \\"Botany Bay\\" was a metonym for transportation to any of the Australian penal settlements. HistoryAboriginal history= Archaeological evidence from the shores of Botany Bay has yielded evidence of an Aboriginal settlement dating back 5,000 years. The Aboriginal people of Sydney were known as the Eora, with sub-groups derived from the languages they spoke. The people living between the Cooks River and the Georges River were the Bidjigal clan; on the southern shores of the bay were the Gweagal clan, while on the northern shore it was the Kameygal clan. = British history= Isaac Smith became the first European to set foot on eastern Australian soil, Cook telling him \\"Jump out, Isaac\\" as the ship's boat touched the shore at Botany Bay. Charles Gore Lieutenant James Cook first landed at Kurnell, on the southern banks of Botany Bay, in what is now Silver Beach, on Sunday 29 April 1770, when navigating his way up the east coast of Australia on his ship, HMS Endeavour. Cook's landing marked the beginning of Britain's interest in Australia and in the eventual colonisation of this new \\"southern continent\\". Initially the name Stingrays Harbour was used by Cook and other journal keepers on his expedition, for the stingrays they caught. That name was also recorded on an Admiralty chart.Beaglehole (ed.) 1968, p. ccix Cook's log for 6 May 1770 records \\"The great quantity of these sort of fish found in this place occasioned my giving it the name of Stingrays Harbour\\". However, in the journal prepared later from his log, Cook wrote instead: (sic) \\"The great quantity of plants Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander found in this place occasioned my giving it the name of ~~Botanist~~ Botany Bay\\". Eighteen years later, in 1788, Governor Arthur Phillip sailed the armed tender HMS Supply into the bay on 18 January. First contact was made with the local Indigenous people, the Eora, who seemed curious but suspicious of the newcomers. Two days later the remaining ships of the First Fleet arrived to found the planned penal colony. However, the land was quickly ruled unsuitable for settlement as there was insufficient fresh water; Phillip also believed the swampy foreshores would render any colony unhealthy as the bay was open and unprotected, the water too shallow to allow the ships to anchor close to the shore, and the soil was poor.Parker 2009, p.113 The area was studded with enormously strong trees. When the convicts tried to cut them down, their tools broke and the tree trunks had to be blasted out of the ground with gunpowder. The primitive huts built for the officers and officials quickly collapsed in rainstorms. Crucially, Phillip worried that his fledgling colony was exposed to attack from Aborigines or foreign powers. Although his initial instructions were to establish the colony at Botany Bay, he was authorised to establish the colony elsewhere if necessary. As such, Phillip decided instead to move to the excellent natural harbour of Port Jackson to the north.Governor Phillip to Lord Sydney, 15 May 1788, cited in Britten (ed.) 1978, pp. 121–123 On the morning of 24 January the French exploratory expedition of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse was seen outside Botany Bay. On 26 January, the Supply left the bay to move up to Port Jackson and anchor in Sydney Cove. On the afternoon of 26 January, the remaining ships of First Fleet arrived at Sydney Cove. In 1789, Captain John Hunter surveyed Botany Bay after returning from the Cape of Good Hope, trading for grain. The good supply of fresh water in the area led to the expansion of its population in the 19th century. The western shore of Botany Bay remained in its virgin state for almost fifty years after the initial settlement of Sydney Town. Land access to the area was difficult until a route from the west was established via Canterbury. As this route developed it became known as Illawarra Road, which is still one of the main access routes to the south-eastern suburbs of Sydney. The land nearer to this crossing of Cooks River was cleared and settled quite early in the infancy of the new colony. Landmarks Monument at La Perouse. Sydney Airport, Australia's busiest airport, sits on the northwestern side of Botany Bay. Some of its runways go out into the bay. After World War II the mouth of the Cooks River was moved two kilometres west to make way for the airport extension. Land was reclaimed from the bay to extend its first north–south runway and to build a second, parallel, runway. The first container terminal at Port Botany, east of the airport, was completed during the 1970s and is the largest container terminal in Sydney. A second container terminal was completed during the 1980s and bulk liquid storage facilities are located on the northern and southern edge of the bay. A third container terminal was completed in 2011. The land around the headlands of the bay is protected by the National Parks and Wildlife Service as Kamay Botany Bay National Park. On the northern side of the mouth of the bay is the historic site of La Perouse, and to the south is Kurnell. Despite its relative isolation, the southern shore of the bay is dominated by an unusual mixture of pristine national park and heavy industrial use that includes Kurnell Desalination Plant, the Caltex Fuel Terminal, sewer treatment, and historical sand mining facilities. On the southern side of the bay a section of water has been fenced off under the authority of the National Parks and Wildlife Service at Towra Point for environmental conservation purposes. The western shores of the bay feature many popular swimming beaches including Lady Robinsons Beach and are highly urbanised. There are also a lot of bunkers around Botany Bay. The bunkers were built by the military during WWII and still remain. Marine life Botany Bay has a diverse marine population, and the area around its entrance is a popular area for scuba diving. In recent times, the Botany Bay Watch Project has begun with volunteers assisting to monitor and protect the Bay Catchment and its unique marine life. The world's largest population of weedy sea dragon ever surveyed is found at the 'Steps' dive site, on the Kurnell side of the Botany Bay National Park. Weedy sea dragons are just one of hundreds of territorial marine creatures found within Botany Bay. The eastern blue groper is the state fish of New South Wales; it is very tame and is commonly found following divers along the shoreline of Botany Bay. In popular culture * Despite the move to Sydney Cove, for many years the Australian penal colony would be referred to as \\"Botany Bay\\" in England, and in ballads such as \\"The Fields of Athenry,\\" by Irish songwriter Pete St. John. * A song named \\"Botany Bay\\" has been performed as a folk and music hall song since the 1890s, based on older tunes. It also refers to the penal colony. * A song entitled \\"The Shores of Botany Bay\\" was written by Brian Warfield and recorded by The Wolfe Tones in the early 1970s. This satirical song deals with a group of Irishmen volunteering for the transportation process in the hopes of finding wealth in Australia. * A song titled \\"Bound for Botany Bay\\" is featured on Irish singer- songwriter and guitarist John Doyle's album Shadow and Light. * In the 1941 historical novel Botany Bay by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, the protagonist, after various adventures and misadventures in England, gets transported to Botany Bay. A movie based on the book starring Alan Ladd and James Mason was shot in 1953. * The song \\"Jim Jones at Botany Bay\\" (aka \\"Jim Jones\\") is about a prisoner who is going to Botany Bay.

Trained as a lawyer in Cape Town and London, Reitz started off in law practice and diamond prospecting before being appointed Chief Justice of the Orange Free State.Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 593. In the Orange Free State Reitz played an important role in the modernisation of the legal system and the state's administrative organisation. At the same time he was also prominent in public life, getting involved in the Afrikaner language and culture movement, and cultural life in general.Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 594. He was a South African Freemason. Reitz was a popular personality, both for his politics and his openness. When State President Brand suddenly died in 1888, Reitz won the presidential elections unopposed. After being re-elected in 1895, subsequently making a trip to Europe, Reitz fell seriously ill, and had to retire.Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 595. In 1898, now recovered, he was appointed State Secretary of the South African Republic, and became a leading Afrikaner political figure during the Second Boer War.Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 598. Reluctant to shift allegiance to the British, Reitz went into voluntary exile after the war ended. Several years later he returned to South Africa and set up a law practice again, in Pretoria. In the late 1900s he became involved in politics once more, and upon the declaration of the Union of South Africa in 1910, Reitz was chosen the first president of the Senate.Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 599. Reitz was an important figure in Afrikaner cultural life during most of his life, especially through his poems and other publications.Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 595–596. Family Francis William Reitz, Jr., was born in SwellendamBiography of Francis William Reitz at Worldroots.com mentions Surbiton as place of birth; this is probably a gross misspelling of Swellendam. on 5 October 1844, as the son of Francis William Reitz, Sr. MLC, model farmer and politician, and Cornelia Magdalena Deneys. He was the seventh child in a family of twelve. He grew up at Rhenosterfontein, the model farm () of his father, situated on the borders of the Breederivier (Broad River) in the Cape Colony.Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 592. Reitz married twice. His first marriage (Cape Town 24 June 1874) was to Blanka Thesen (Stavanger, Norway, 15 October 1854 – Bloemfontein, 5 October 1887). She was the sister of Charles Wilhelm Thesen, and the daughter of Arnt Leonard Thesen, tradesman, and Anne Cathrine Margarethe Brandt.Information on parents in Biography of Francis William Reitz at Worldroots.com. The Thesen family had settled in Knysna, Cape Colony, from Norway in 1869. The couple had seven sons and one daughter. After the death of his first wife Reitz remarried (Bloemfontein, 11 December 1889) with Cornelia Maria Theresia Mulder (Delft, Netherlands, 25 December 1863Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 594 and other sources give 1864 as her year of birth, but this is incorrect. See: Digitale Stamboom Gemeentearchief Delft and original birth certificate . – Cape Town 2 January 1935), daughter of Johannes Adrianus Mulder, typesetter, and Engelina Johanna van Hamme. At the time of her marriage Mulder was acting director of the Eunice Ladies' Institute at Bloemfontein. With his second wife he had six sons and one daughter. Deneys, his son, fought against the British in the Second Boer War, commanded the First Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers during World War I and served as a Member of the Union Parliament, Cabinet Minister, Deputy Prime Minister (1939–1943), and South African High Commissioner (1944) to the Court of St. James's. His book, Commando: A Boer Journal of the Boer War, has for many years been regarded as one of the best narratives of war and adventure in the English language.A Theory Of Civilization Education Reitz received his earliest schooling at home, from a governess, and at a neighbouring farm. When he was nine years old, he went to the Rouwkoop Boarding School in Rondebosch (Cape Town). Here he stood out for his academic achievements and was subsequently elected Queen's Scholar by the Senate of the South African College in Cape Town. In the six years he spent at the College, after arriving in 1857, he received a broad education in arts and sciences, and developed himself into a well-balanced young man with obvious leadership qualities. He graduated from South African College in September 1863 with the equivalent of a modern bachelor's degree in arts and sciences. By then, Reitz had developed a keen interest in law, and he continued his studies at South African College, reading law with professor F.S. Watermeyer. The latter's death only months after Reitz started working with him, made Reitz decide to continue his studies in London, at the Inner Temple. It was a decision that needed deliberation, as his father was hoping for his son to return to the farm in due time, and the financial situation of the family was not strong. However, Reitz did go to London, and finished his studies successfully. He was called to the bar at Westminster on 11 June 1867. During his time in England Reitz became interested in politics, and regularly attended sessions of the House of Commons. Before returning to South Africa he made a tour of Europe. Back in South Africa, Reitz established himself as a barrister in Cape Town, where he was called to the bar on 23 January 1868. Early career In the beginning Reitz found it hard to make a living, as competition among lawyers in Cape Town was quite severe at this time. Nevertheless, he succeeded in making a name for himself, due to his sharp legal mind and his social intelligence. Being part of the western Circuit Court of the Cape Colony gave him a lot of experience in a very short time. At the same time, Reitz nurtured his political interests by writing lead articles for the Cape Argus newspaper, for which he also reported on the proceedings of the Cape Parliament and acted as deputy editor. In 1870 Reitz moved his legal practice to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State. The discovery of diamonds on the banks of the Vaal River, Reitz thought, would lead to a growth of legal work and enable him to set up a thriving practice. This was not to be, however, and after a few months Reitz left Bloemfontein to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West, where he bought a small claim near Pniel from the Berlin Missionary Society. This enterprise also proved unsuccessful, and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town. This time, his Cape Town law practice was successful, ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State diamondfields (1871) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony. In 1873 Reitz was asked to represent the district of Beaufort West in the Cape Parliament. The day he took his seat, 30 May, his father, who was the representative for Swellendam, announced his retirement from the Assembly. As so many of Reitz's activities up to that point, his parliamentary career was short-lived. Only two months later, President Johannes Brand of the Orange Free State offered Reitz the position of chairman of the newly formed Appellate court of the Orange Free State, despite the fact that Reitz was not fully qualified (inter alia too young). Reitz refused the offer for this reason, but when another candidate also refused, Brand insisted on the nomination of Reitz, and convinced the Volksraad to appoint him. Judge and official of Orange Free State President F.W. Reitz of the Orange Free State, 1890 With his appointment to the judiciary of the Orange Free State, Reitz came into his own. His arrival – now almost thirty years old and just married – in Bloemfontein in August 1874 was the start of a residency of twenty-one years, as well as the start of a glowing career, to be crowned with his election as State President. Before the mid-1870s, the judicial system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and haphazard in character, particularly because most of the judges were legally unqualified. Most of the judicial procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called Landdrosts, whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling deeply ingrained political traditions that stood in the way of the modernisation of the judicial system, but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he had to win the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God- fearing beliefs. It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters. Institutionally, Reitz did much for the codification and review of the laws of the Orange Free State. With his colleagues C.J. Vels, O.J. Truter, and J.G. Fraser Reitz published the first Ordonnantie boek van den Oranje Vrijstaat (Ordinance Book of the Orange Free State) in 1877, making the acts and ordinances of the republic available to the larger public. He also played a role in the revision of the constitution of the Orange Free State, with regard to articles on citizenship and the right to vote, was chairman of the examination committee for aspirant practitioners, and contributed to the improvement of the prison system and the district administration. State President of Orange Free State Statue of Francis William Reitz in Bloemfontein Already in 1878, voices sounded for Reitz to run for the presidency, but President Brand's position was still very strong and Reitz openly praised his qualities and refused to stand against him. In the late 1870s and early 1880s the political temperature ran high in the Orange Free State. The annexation of the South African Republic (Transvaal) by the British in 1877 and the First Anglo-Boer War of 1880–1881 in which that republic regained its autonomy impacted deeply on political sentiments in the Orange Free State. On the one hand there were those who propagated caution in the relationship with the British, on the other there developed a political movement that strongly propagated a (reawakened) Afrikaner national consciousness. Reitz was part of the latter, and together with C.L.F. Borckenhagen, editor of the Bloemfontein Express newspaper, he wrote a constitution for the Afrikaner Bond (Afrikaner Union), a political party originally set up by leading Afrikaner politicians in the Cape Colony, like Rev S.J. du Toit and his Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners ('Society of True Afrikaners') and Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and the Zuidafrikaansche Boeren Beschermings Vereeniging ('South African Boer Protection Association'). Among the supporters of this new Afrikaner nationalism in the Orange Free State was also Reitz's successor, M.T. Steyn, then still a young lawyer. The constitution was presented in April 1881, and several months later Reitz became the chairman of the Bond. His overt political activities earned Reitz criticism from those who feared a breakdown of relations with the British. It is obvious, however, that a wind of change was blowing through the Boer republics and among the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony, which was to change Anglo-Boer relations drastically. In the Orange Free State President Brand was one of the politicians who held on to a more cautious and consolidating policy towards the British government at the Cape, maintaining strict neutrality. In this position Brand followed the habit of a lifetime, and it earned him a British knighthood. Despite the changing political climate and the polarisation of political positions, Brand remained hugely popular with the burghers of the Orange Free State. The presidential elections of 1883 could on content have become a political battle between the pan-Dutch Afrikaner Bond supporters and followers of the Brand-line. However, Reitz, as the ideal pan- Dutch candidate, again refused to stand against Brand. Only when Brand died in office five years later, the time was ripe for change. Reitz stood candidate and won a landslide victory on the ticket of Afrikaner nationalism. He was inaugurated as state president in the Tweetoringkerk (Two-Towers Church) in Bloemfontein on 10 January 1889. As president Reitz was one of the first Afrikaners to actively develop a so-called Bantu policy, in philosophy and terminology going beyond contemporary ideas on segregation between white and black. Under his government Indian immigrants were by law forbidden to settle in the Orange Free State (1890). This led to a confrontation with the British government and an extensive correspondence between Reitz and the British high commissioner in Cape Town, in which internal sovereignty was claimed and established. In economic terms, the late 1880s were a period of growth in the Orange Free State. Agriculture picked up, and the railway system became an important source of income as well. Reitz was instrumental in the modernisation of farming, propagating new techniques and a scientific approach to the prevention of plagues. Here Reitz showed himself the agriculturalist and model farmer his father had been before him. Third Council Hall (Derde Raadszaal) of the Volksraad of the Orange Free State, Bloemfontein, 1893, just before it was replaced by the Vierde Raadszaal Under Reitz's presidency the new meeting hall for the Volksraad, the so-called Vierde Raadszaal (Fourth Council Hall) was opened (1893), and the new Government Building received a second floor (1895). Outside Bloemfontein the road network received attention. As could be expected, immediately after he was inaugurated, Reitz contacted the government of the South African Republic with the objective to establish new and closer political ties. Already on 4 March 1889 the Orange Free State and the South African Republic concluded a treaty of common defence at Potchefstroom. Treaties about trade and the railways were to follow. Even earlier, in January 1889, the Volksraad charged Reitz to negotiate a customs treaty with both the British South African colonies and the South African Republic. On 20 March 1889 a Customs Conference was held in Bloemfontein which led to an agreement between the Orange Free State and the Cape Colony which was hugely beneficial for the former. The economic benefits grew further when new railway lines were opened between the Cape Colony and Bloemfontein (1890) and between Bloemfontein and Johannesburg (1892), directly connecting Cape Town with Johannesburg and turning the Orange Free State into a transit economy. For Reitz the development of a unified South African railway system was also a political goal: the railways as a means to diminish mutual distrust and create unity and mutual understanding between the white population of South Africa. Reitz's policies were appreciated by the Volksraad, reflecting the change in the mood of the Afrikaner electorate towards Afrikaner nationalism. Months before the presidential election of 1893 the Volksraad endorsed Reitz's candidature with a vote of forty-three against eighteen. Reitz accepted the endorsement on the condition that he be allowed three months leave to Europe. On 22 November 1893 he was re-elected, again with a landslide majority.Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 597. The trip to Europe was far from just a family holiday. In Britain Reitz made some strong public statements, defending the republican system of government in South Africa and opposing British intervention in 'Bantu affairs'. On the continent Reitz was received by several heads of state and political leaders. In October 1894 he returned in Bloemfontein. Soon after Reitz was diagnosed with hepatitis, which moreover affected his already strained nerves and led to sleeplessness. The situation was so serious that he eventually had to resign the presidency. The Volksraad accepted his resignation on 11 December 1895. In June 1896 Reitz travelled to Europe once more on a five-month trip to recover from his debilitating illness. On his return to South Africa he established himself in Pretoria in the South African Republic in July 1897, where he set up a new law practice. State Secretary of South African Republic F.W. Reitz as State Secretary of the South African Republic and signatory to the Peace of Vereeniging, 1902 Reitz did not stay a private person for long because a conflict between the South African Republic legislature and judiciary resulted in the dismissal of the Chief Justice. Reitz then took up an appointment as judge in early 1898 and quickly became part of the inner circle of the Transvaal administration. At the time the relationship with the British was already rapidly deteriorating and the government of the South African Republic was taking action to reinforce its national and international position. One of the measures taken was to replace State Secretary W.J. Leyds, who had the Dutch nationality, with a South African. Leyds was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Europe to represent the Republic abroad. Reitz took his place as State Secretary in June 1898, after Abraham Fischer had declined. As State Secretary Reitz had a complicated and hefty job. After the State President he was the most important member of the Executive Council (Uitvoerende Raad). As the most senior civil servant he was responsible for the oversight over the implementation of the laws and regulations, as well as for all the correspondence of the President, official government reports, etc. He was also an intermediary between the Executive Council and parliament, the First and Second Volksraad, and a key figure in the foreign affairs of the State. Experienced and well organised as he himself was Reitz managed to quickly modernise the structure of the state apparatus, by implementing regulations for the running of the government departments, appointing an archivist for his own, and by prescribing that all correspondence with the government should be in Dutch. The State President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, was not an easy man to work with, and in some circles it was predicted that Reitz would quickly find himself subordinated to Kruger. This was not the case, however. On occasion the two men clashed on matters of policy, but Reitz remained true to his own convictions, gaining some influence over Kruger in the process. Originally praised by the British for his diplomatic courtesy, their attitude quickly changed when they understood that Reitz was a protagonist of Transvaal independence. Reitz was sometimes rather brazen in his political statements, so when he – incorrectly – claimed the South African Republic to be a fully sovereign state, the British jumped on him. In view of rapidly mounting British pressure and an ensuing armed conflict over the position of the Uitlanders and economic control over the Witwatersrand gold fields, foreign policy in the South African Republic was eventually determined by a triumvirate: State President Kruger, State Secretary Reitz, and State Attorney General J.C. Smuts. During 1899 they decided that an offensive attitude towards British demands was the only way forward, despite the risks this entailed. Reitz sought and received the support of the Orange Free State for this approach. On 9 October 1899 the South African Republic and the Orange Free State issued a joint ultimatum to the British government to retract their demands. The British government did not give in to the ultimatum, and two days later, on 11 October 1899, the Second Anglo-Boer War (South African War) broke out. When the British army marched on Pretoria in May 1900, the government was forced to flee the capital. From that moment on, Reitz was responsible for the continuous relocation of its seat throughout the Transvaal, which occurred sixty-two times until March 1902. In May of that year, Reitz took an active part in the peace negotiations with the British, and he was one of the signatories of the Treaty of Vereeniging, signed in Pretoria on 31 May 1902. Self-chosen exile and return to politics Although instrumental in drafting the Treaty of Vereeniging, Reitz personally did not want to swear allegiance to the British government and chose to go into exile. On 4 July 1902, he left South Africa and joined his wife and children in the Netherlands. To alleviate his financial troubles, Reitz set out on a lecture tour in the United States. A waning interest in the Boer cause since the war was over made the tour fail and forced Reitz to return to the Netherlands. There, his health failed him again, leading to his hospitalisation and an extensive period of convalescing. He was theb supported by his friends W.J. Leyds and H.P.N. Muller and the Nederlandsch Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging (Dutch South-African Society). In 1907, after the old Boer republics received self-government, and in the run-up to the formation of the Union of South Africa, leading Afrikaner politicians J.C. Smuts and L. Botha asked Reitz to return to South Africa and play a role in politics again. Together with his wife, he established himself in Sea Point, Cape Town. In 1910, already sixty-six years old, he was appointed president of the Senate of the newly formed Union of South Africa. These were no easy years, again, as former Afrikaner compatriots found each other on two sides of the political fence, in a rapidly changing world. As in his earlier life, Reitz remained a man of outspoken convictions, which he aired freely. As such, he came into conflict with the Smuts government, and in 1920 he was not re-appointed as president of the Senate. He did remain a member of that House until 1929, however. Honours and death As an important public figure, Reitz was honoured and remembered in different ways. In 1923, Reitz the University of Stellenbosch bestowed on him an honorary doctorate in law for his public services. Already in 1889, a village was named after him in the Orange Free State. In 1894 one also named a village after his second wife, Cornelia. A ship named after him, the President Reitz, sank off Port Elizabeth in 1947.Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 597, 599. The Jubilee Diamond, found in the Free State village of Jagersfontein in 1895 was originally named the Reitz Diamond, but renamed in honour of the sixtieth anniversary of the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1897. When he finally retired from public life, Reitz moved to Gordon's Bay, but returned to Cape Town several years later, where he had a house in Tamboerskloof and was taken care of by his daughter Bessie, a medical doctor. He remained active to the end with writing and translating. Reitz died at his house Botuin on 27 March 1934, and received a state funeral three days later, with a funeral service at the Grote Kerk. He was buried at the Woltemade cemetery at Maitland.Maitland was also home to the British Boer War Memorial Cultural figure Reitz was an important figure in Afrikaner cultural life. He was a poet and published many poems in Afrikaans, which made him a progenitor of the development of Afrikaans as a cultural language. As such he sympathised with the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners (Society of Real Afrikaners), established in the Cape Colony in 1875. Although he never became a member himself, he was an active contributor to the society's journal, Die Suid-Afrikaansche Patriot. With his literary work, Reitz was solidly anchored in the so-called First Afrikaans Language Movement, although he was less interested in the didactic drive of that movement than in writing in Afrikaans as a purely cultural activity. Much of his work was based on English texts, which he translated, edited, and adapted. In the process he produced completely new works of art.Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 596. For Reitz, Afrikaans was predominantly a language of culture, not of government, where he propagated the use of the official language of the Boer republics, Dutch. During his presidency of the Orange Free State, where the use of English was significant among the burghers, he strongly promoted the use of Dutch, against politicians like John G. Fraser and others who were in favour of English. Institutionally, Reitz promoted the foundation of the Letterkundige en Wetenschappelijke Vereeniging (Literary and Scientific Society) of the Orange Free State, of which he was chairman for a while, the library at Bloemfontein, and the National Museum of the Orange Free State.Moll, 'Reitz, Francis William', 595–598.

A Century of Wrong At the advent of the South African War (Second Anglo-Boer War), F.W.

History As the time approached in 1987 for the renegotiation of the existing base agreement, which had entered into force in 1983 for a five-year period, pressures mounted for a reduction of the United States military presence in Spain. Communist political groups and elements of the PSOE had campaigned against the bases. Moreover, the base agreement had become a symbol of United States cooperation with the former Spanish State. It was important to many Spaniards to eliminate vestiges of this history by converting Spain's long-standing bilateral relations with the United States into a multilateral undertaking through NATO. The outcome of the 1986 referendum on membership in NATO committed the Spanish government to negotiate the reduction of the United States military presence in Spain. Spain insisted that the F-16 aircraft be removed from Torrejon as a condition for renewal of the base agreement, and the Spanish government threatened to expel all United States forces in Spain if this demand were not accepted. The United States felt that the Spanish military contribution was minimal and the Spanish government was permitting domestic factors to dictate a weakening of NATO defenses. Even though Italy subsequently agreed to station the F-16 wing at Aviano Air Base, the cost of transfer would be high, and the unit would be in a more exposed position to Warsaw Pact forces. In January 1988, Spain and the United States announced jointly that agreement had been reached in principle on a new base agreement with an initial term of eight years, essentially meeting the conditions demanded by Spain. The F-16s were to be removed from Torrejon within three years, by mid-1991. It was expected that this step would reduce the number of United States personnel in Spain by nearly one-half. Implementation of this agreement was delayed by the 1990–91 crisis in Kuwait, when the 401st TFW was one of the first American fighter wings to respond, with the 612th TFS deploying to its wartime base at Incirlik Turkey and the 614th TFS becoming the first US military unit to deploy to the Persian Gulf State of Qatar. Both squadrons flew numerous operational missions during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. After the 1991 cease-fire in Iraq, plans proceeded to close Torrejon Air Base. On 28 June, the 613th TFS was inactivated and its aircraft sent to Air National Guard squadrons in the United States. The 612th TFS inactivated on 1 October, and the 614th TFS on 1 January 1992. In accordance with the 1988 agreement, the USAF portion of the base was returned to the Spanish government on 21 May 1996, with the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing being transferred to Aviano Air Base, Italy without personnel or equipment.

The Fossil Falls are part of the Coso Field, created by the prehistoric Owens River. They are within the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake and northeast of Little Lake and U.S. Route 395. Geology Initiation of volcanism at Coso preceded the onset of Basin and Range crustal extension there, as expressed by normal faulting. The earlier of the two principal periods of volcanism began with the emplacement of basalt flows over a surface of little relief. Then, during the ensuing period of approximately 1.5 million years, eruptive activity included chemically more evolved rocks erupted upon a faulted terrain of substantial relief. Following a 1.5-million-year hiatus with few eruptions, a bimodal volcanic field of basalt lava flows and rhyolite lava domes and flows developed on Basin and Range terrain of essentially the same form as today's landscape. Many of the young basalt flows are intercanyon, occupying parts of the present-day drainage system. The Coso Volcanic Field is best known for its Pleistocene rhyolite. Thirty-eight rhyolite domes and flows form an elongate array atop a north-trending 8 x 20-kilometer horst of Mesozoic bedrock. Nearby uneroded constructional forms are exhibited by most domes. Many are nested within tuff ring craters, and a few filled and overrode their craters to feed flows a kilometer or two long. The two oldest domes contain several percent phenocrysts; the rest are essentially aphyric. Obsidian is exposed locally on most extrusions, and analyses of fresh glass indicate that all of the rhyolite is of the so-called high-silica variety; SiO2 content is essentially constant at 77 percent. Other major-element constituents are nearly invariant. However, trace-element contents vary and help define 7 age groups, each of unique chemical composition. Prehistoric Period Obsidian from the Coso Volcanic Fields was heavily exploited by Native American Coso People to make knives, projectile points, and the like (Hughes 1998). The chief period of exploitation was between approximately 3000 and 1000 years ago, when people mined obsidian by constructing benches in hillsides and digging deep pits to access raw materials (Elston and Zeier 1984; Gilreath and Hildebrand 1997). Obsidian from the volcanic fields was traded all the way to the California coast in San Diego, San Luis Obispo County, Santa Barbara, California, and throughout the Mojave Desert and regions further east. Archaeologists recognize at least four different geochemical subsources: Sugarloaf, West Sugarloaf, Joshua Ridge, and West Cactus Peak. These different subsources were used to varying degrees in different time periods, but the Sugarloaf and West Sugarloaf were the most commonly exploited geochemical types (Eerkens and Rosenthal 2004; Ericson and Glascock 2004). Coso Geothermal Power Project The Coso Volcanic Field is well known as a geothermal area. Fumaroles are present along faults bounding the rhyolite-capped horst and locally within the rhyolite field. A multi- disciplinary program of geothermal assessment carried out in the 1970s defined a potential resource of 650 megawatts electric with a nominal life span of 30 years. Judged by the youthfulness of the rhyolite lavas and by a zone of low seismic velocity crust roughly beneath the rhyolite, a magma body may be the source of thermal energy for the geothermal system. Commercial power development began in the 1980s. Located within the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake Station near Ridgecrest, California, power plants at the Coso Geothermal were operated by Caithness Energy, LLC (Reno, Nevada) and sold in 2006. It currently produces 270 MW from four geothermal power plants. More than 100 wells have been drilled throughout the field, with production depths from 2,000 to 12,000 feet (610 to 3,700 m), and temperatures from 200° to 350 °C. Coso began generating electricity in 1987. Improvements have resulted in more efficient use of the resource.  Seismicity  The Coso Volcanic Field is one of the most seismically active regions in the United States, producing dozens of tremors in the M1 and M2 range each week. Tremors in the M3 range occur at a rate of 2–6 per month and M4 quakes occur two-three times each year. Recent activity in the M5 range happened in 1996 and 1998 when tremors of M5.3, M5.1, M5.2, and M5.0 occurred within a day of each other. These tremors were actually recorded along the eastern side of the Coso Volcanic Field, 15 miles (24 km). September 30, 2009 to October 6, 2009 there have been 429 earthquakes ranging from 0.1 to 5.2. Some days have activity at about one tremor every minute. On October 2, 2009 there were three earthquakes, (5.2, 4.7, and a 4.9), all within one hour of each other. On July 4th and 5th, 2019 two large earthquakes sparked a surge of activity in the area in and around the Coso Volcanic Field. The first large quake on July 4th registered M6.4 and the largest on July 5th registered M7.1. Within a week, more than 8000 (M1.0-4.5) smaller earthquakes had joined the swarm, though only 27 quakes larger than M4.5 occurred after the largest events. Surprisingly, there were no fatalities in California. Residents in Ridgecrest and neighboring unincorporated town Trona had moderate to severe property damage. Two structure fires, loss of power for up to 24 hours in some areas, and Trona was without water. Highway 178, one of the two ways in or out of Trona was blocked from rockslides and impassable shifted sections of asphalt. Ridgecrest had declared a state of emergency as a result. One fatality was reported in Nevada in the following days. Earthquake swarms are common in the Coso area, often producing hundreds of tremors over periods as short as a few days. This brisk and robust seismic activity is common in volcanic areas, such as Long Valley Caldera near Mammoth Lakes, and Yellowstone Caldera at Yellowstone. The Coso Volcanic Field shows examples of volcanic activity, probably last active 30,000 to 40,000 years ago, but ash emission and small cone building episodes may be Holocene (>10,000 years) in age.

The island lies between the islands of Nevis and Montserrat, within the inner arc of the Leeward Islands chain, in the West Indies. Redonda is legally a dependency of the country of Antigua and Barbuda. The island is just over long and wide, rising to a peak. The island teems with bird life, but is more or less uninhabitable by humans because there is no source of freshwater other than rain, and most of the island is extremely steep and rocky, with only a relatively small, sloping plateau area of grassland at the summit. Landing on the island is a very challenging process, possible only via the leeward coast on days when the seas are calm. Climbing to the top of the island is also very arduous. Despite these difficulties, from 1865 until 1912 Redonda was the centre of a lucrative trade in guano mining, and many thousands of tons of phosphates were shipped from Redonda to Britain. The ruins associated with the mineworkings can still be seen on the island. Redonda also is a micronation which may, arguably and briefly, have existed as an independent kingdom during the 19th century, according to an account told by the fantasy writer M. P. Shiel. The title to the supposed kingdom is still contested to this day in a half-serious fashion. The \\"Kingdom\\" is also often associated with a number of supposedly aristocratic members, whose titles are awarded by whoever is currently the \\"King\\". Currently there are a number of individuals in different countries who claim to be the sole legitimate \\"King\\" of Redonda. History The history of the \\"Kingdom\\" of Redonda is shrouded in doubt and legend, and it is difficult to separate fact from fiction.John D. Squires, “Of Dreams and Shadows: An Outline of the Redonda Legend with Some Notes on Various Claimants to its Uncertain Throne.” =During Shiel's lifetime= M. P. Shiel (1865–1947), an author of works of adventure and fantasy fiction, was the first person to give an account of the \\"Kingdom of Redonda,\\" in 1929, in a promotional pamphlet for a reissue of his books.John D. Squires, \\"The Redonda Legend: A Chronological Bibliography\\" According to tradition, Shiel's father, Matthew Dowdy Shiell, who was a trader and Methodist lay preacher from the nearby island of Montserrat, claimed the island of Redonda when his son, Matthew Phipps Shiell, was born. Supposedly the father felt he could legitimately do this, because it appeared to be the case that no country had officially claimed the islet as territory. Shiell senior is also said to have requested the title of King of Redonda from Queen Victoria, and as legend has it, it was granted to him, by the British Colonial Office rather than by Victoria herself, provided there was no revolt against colonial power.Paul de Fortis, “A History of Redonda,” in The Kingdom of Redonda, 1865-1990 ed. by Rev. Paul de Fortis, Cheshire: The Alyesford Press, 1991. The son (originally named Matthew Phipps Shiell but later known as the writer M. P. Shiel) claimed he was crowned on Redonda at the age of 15, in 1880, by a bishop from Antigua. However, as M. P. Shiel's recounting of this story never saw print until 1929, it is possible that some, or most, or possibly all of the story of his being crowned King of Redonda may in fact be pure invention.Squires, “Of Dreams and Shadows” In his writings about Redonda, however, Shiel is critical of the egotism that led him to accept the title, suggesting that there may have been some truth behind the story of the coronation. Shiel does however cite two different names for the bishop who performed the coronation: the Reverend Dr Mitchinson and the Rev. Hugh Semper. These men were both genuine clerics in the Caribbean during this period. The contradiction could of course be explained as due to Shiel's faulty memory rather than the story being based on total invention. In “About Myself” Shiel writes that his attempt to impose a tribute tax on the American guano miners was a request they refused. This early non-recognition of his kingship is another possible argument that the coronation actually occurred. Several of Shiel's works of fiction concerned various aspects of monarchy. One of his detective heroes is called Cummings King Monk. In Shiel's 1901 end-of- the-world story The Purple Cloud, the protagonist Adam Jeffson, the last man on earth, establishes himself as monarch of the devastated globe, while Shiel's novel The Lord of the Sea (1901) has Richard Hogarth, another Overman figure, coming to dominate the world. In 1899, Shiel wrote about visiting Redonda in his adventure novel Contraband of War. In later life, Shiel gave the title, and the rights to his work, to his chief admirer, London poet and editor John Gawsworth (Terence Ian Fytton Armstrong), the biographer of Arthur Machen, who was the realm's Archduke. Gawsworth (1912–70) seems to have passed on the title several times when the writer was low in funds. Gawsworth's realm has been facetiously termed \\"Almadonda\\" (by the Shielian scholar A. Reynolds Morse (1914-2000)) after the Alma pub in Westbourne Grove, Bayswater, London, where \\"King Juan\\" frequently held court in the 1960s.A. Reynolds Morse, The Works of M. P. Shiel, Vol III, The Shielography Updated, part 2, Cleveland: The Reynolds Morse Foundation, 1980, pp 531-552. =After Shiel's death= Gawsworth had also apparently promised to make the first son of his friends Charles and Jean Leggett, Max John Juan Leggett, his Redondan heir if they gave the child (born in the late 1950s), his royal name of Juan. Some Redondan scholars accept that Gawsworth bestowed the title on his friend the publican Arthur John Roberts in 1967, by \\"Irrevocable Covenant\\". Prior to this the late writer Dominic Behan (1928–89) also claimed Gawsworth transferred the title to him in 1960. It is also said that Gawsworth handed on the throne to one Aleph Kamal, whose peers include the novelist Edna O'Brien. Self-appointed monarchs of Redonda include Marvin Kitman and William Scott Home. Scott Home's claim to the title was, he says, based on ESP and reincarnation. M. P. Shiel's granddaughter, Lancashire housewife Mrs Margaret Parry, came to the fore in 1993 and was hailed as “Queen Maggie” of Redonda by various newspapers, including the Daily Mail.“Hail Queen Maggie, monarch of Redonda,” Daily Mail, (Tuesday, May 18, 1993.) Publisher, author and environmentalist Jon Wynne- Tyson, however, claims that Gawsworth, prior to dying in 1970, bestowed the kingship on him with the literary executorships, although the writer Iain Fletcher was the joint literary executor for Gawsworth. =Later developments= Jon Wynne-Tyson subsequently visited Redonda in 1979, on an expedition organized by the philanthropist and Shielian publisher A. Reynolds Morse. Wynne-Tyson ruled as King Juan II until abdicating in favour of the novelist Javier Marías of Madrid in 1997, transferring the literary executorship of Gawsworth and Shiel along with the title.Jon Wynne-Tyson, Finding the Words: A Publishing Life, Wilby, Norwich: Michael Russell, 2004. (Chapter 8, ‘The Cause of Half Our Sorrows,’ covers the author’s perspective on Gawsworth, Redonda and the transfer of his disputed royal claim to Javier Marías, pp 158-195.) Javier Marías, “The Art of Fiction No. 190,” an interview by Sarah Fay, The Paris Review, Winter 2006, No. 179. (Includes Marías’ perspective on the legend.) Arthur John Roberts’ title was subsequently inherited by William Leonard Gates, whom Gawsworth had given the title of \\"Baron L'Angelier de Blythswood de Redonda\\". From his home at Thurlton, Norfolk, Gates, who was known as King Leo, presided over a group known as \\"The Redondan Foundation\\", not be confused with \\"The Redondan Cultural Foundation\\" set up by Paul de Fortis (see below). Gates died on 2 January 2019 and his crown passed to Queen Josephine. As in Gawsworth's reign, meetings of these rival groups have been held at the Fitzroy Tavern in Fitzrovia, central London. King Leo reigned as king for thirty years, since 1989.Henry Hutchison, Realm of Redonda : A Definitive History of the Island-Kingdom of Santa Maria la Redonda in the West Indies, The Redondan Foundation: Thurlton, Norwich, 2005.

Because of what he viewed as the inaction of the various rival monarchs, de Fortis promoted a new king, Cedric Boston (born on Montserrat in 1960). Boston claimed the Redondan throne in 1984, winning the allegiance of a number of Gawsworth's peers.Paul de Fortis, “A History of Redonda,” in The Kingdom of Redonda, 1865-1990 ed. by Rev. Paul de Fortis, Cheshire: The Alysford Press, 1991, 19-41. (Argues the case for Cedric Boston.) On the question of the Kingdom of Redonda, Wynne- Tyson has written: A stellar legion of Redondan peers, largely writers, date back to the Shiel and Gawsworth eras.

The choir dates back to the early 13th century, whilst the transept and nave took shape a century later. The cathedral was damaged and restored on several occasions, making its current appearance rather modern. In the 1760s, it was given a baroque southern facade. The current Gothic Revival design dates to restorations in 1886–1894 under architect Helgo Zettervall (1831–1907). The previously flat twin towers were given pointed Gothic spires. The 37 mosaic stained glass windows were created by the artist Bo Beskow (1906-1989) in cooperation with glazier Gustav Ringström between 1945 and 1976. The motifs are mostly biblical, but the two Swedish saints Bridget of Sweden and Helena of Skövde are also depicted. No windows from the medieval church have been preserved.

The new Israel Defense Forces repelled the Iraqi attacks and forced them back into the Samarian mountains, although Kfar Yona remained the easternmost Jewish settlement in the area. As a result of the 1949 Armistice Agreements, the border moved from Kfar Yona 8 km eastward, to just west of Tulkarm. Kfar Yona was surrounded by orchards and its main income was from selling oranges. Most of these orchards are now the site of new neighborhoods. Next to Kfar Yona is the Area 21 military base, named for Mota Gur, which includes paratroopers, Nahal, military police, and other small bases. In addition, Kfar Yona borders Pardesiya and the Lev HaSharon Regional Council. =Neighborhoods=Kfar Yona Alef Kfar Yona Alef The original ten homes and the first community building.

Игорь Ансов; original surname is Ansov) (December 12, 1918 – July 14, 2002) was a Russian American applied mathematician and business manager. He is known as the father of strategic management. BiographyEarly life= Igor Ansoff was born in Vladivostok, Russia, on December 12, 1918. His father was an American born Russian from Evansville, Indiana and his mother was a Russian from Moscow. At the time of Igor's birth, Ansoff, Sr., was secretary to the American Consul General in Moscow, David R. Francis, and had just completed a cross-Siberian trip on behalf of the American Red Cross, examining living conditions in prisoner of war camps. This concluded with a trip to Japan in 1918, after which the family moved to Vladivostok. The United States had a large military and industrial presence in the Far East of Russia, with more than 3,000 troops on the ground under the command of General William S. Graves. During the six years that it took for the Bolshevik Revolution to make its way to Vladivostok, US embassies were slowly being shut down and their contents moved east. Many strategic records ended up in Tokyo and were destroyed in an earthquake and fire. Most of the remaining embassy documents made their way to Vladivostok. The Ansoffs lived in Vladivostok until the US Embassy closed in 1924, whereupon they returned to Moscow, with Ansoff, Sr., now a Soviet citizen. They travelled the 9,000 km (5592.3 mi) on the Trans-Siberian Railway, crossing Siberia in the middle of winter in a place where temperatures of -35 Celsius (-31 Fahrenheit) are common. The cattle cars of the trans-siberian were heated by coal burning stoves and the occupants slept on straw laid out on timber bunks. With his father's American origin and his mother's \\"capitalist\\" background (her father had owned a small samovar factory in the town of Tula some hundred miles south of Moscow), the Ansoffs were suspected members of the bourgeoisie, a group assumed to harbor \\"counterrevolutionary\\" hopes and tendencies. Igor's life in Moscow engendered in him a distrust of any system (political or organizational) that claimed to be too perfect or too tidy. This spirit \\"expressed itself through my inability to join other 'systems' in which I lived, studied, and worked. It reinforced my drive to excel in order to force the system to recognize and reward me. And perversely, it also drove me to excel through making innovative contributions which challenged the systems cultures.\\" From 1932-1933, two major events occurred in Soviet society: first, a massive and destructive famine, followed by the commencement of the Great Purge. In 1933 there was also a thawing of relations between the USA and the Soviet Union, which led to the re-opening of the US embassy in Moscow under Ambassador William Bullit. With the reestablishment of the American Embassy in Moscow, Ansoff, Sr., was able to get a clerical job and apply for restoration of his American citizenship. The Ansoffs left Russia through Leningrad in September 1936 on a small freighter, which accommodated a dozen passengers. The ship took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean, finally docking in New York. A Russian Orthodox priest took Igor, who was then 17 years old, to the Stuyvesant High School in lower Manhattan, which was one of two premier high schools in New York City. With the aid of the priest, Igor's grades were translated into American equivalents which made it possible for him to graduate after only one year. In 1937, Igor graduated with the highest honors at the end of the year, which guaranteed him a four-year scholarship with all expenses paid in the New York State University system. He was also offered a scholarship at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, one of the best and most expensive engineering schools in the country. The scholarship was for one year and its continuation was contingent on performing in the upper 10% of his class. Contrary to his parents' advice, who were still financially struggling, he went to Stevens. Five years after arriving in New York, Igor graduated at the top of his class from Stevens Institute of Technology. He had also reached the conclusion that he did not want to practice engineering. = Career = Seeking a broader perspective, he received a Master's degree in Modern Physics. World War II intervened, and in 1946 he went to Brown University to get a Doctoral degree in Applied Mathematics. His formal education was completed in 1948 when he was 30 years old. He was married the day after defending his dissertation to his wife Skip, and then traveled to Santa Monica, California, where he joined UCLA in the Senior Executive Program. During World War II, he was a member of the U.S. Naval Reserve, and served as a Liaison with the Russian Navy and as an instructor in physics at the U.S. Naval Academy. In California, he was offered a job in the Mathematics Department of the RAND Corporation. Moving laterally within RAND, Igor become a Project Manager in the large-scale project activity focused on making recommendations to the U.S. Air Force on technology and weapon systems acquisition. His second major study at RAND addressed the vulnerability of NATO Air Forces. The inclusion of \\"soft metrics\\" was treated with disdain by RAND and the airforce, and Igor learned his first lesson in organizational myopia, which was to become one of his primary concerns some 20 years later. In 1957 Igor left RAND to join the Corporate Planning Department of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. At Lockheed he became Vice President of Planning and Director of Diversification. His experience at Lockheed focused his attention and trained him to deal with the problem of managing organizations in the face of environmental discontinuities which became the central focus of his attention during the following 30 years. One morning while shaving Igor realized that he had no idea of what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. While on vacation at Cape Cod he developed a long-term plan to take early retirement from Lockheed and find a job in a school of management. Within a year he was approached by The Graduate School of Industrial Administration at the Carnegie Mellon University about joining the GSIA faculty. When he entered GSIA he was allowed a year free from teaching to enable him to finish his book, Corporate Strategy, which was published in 1965 and was an immediate success. He served as Professor of Industrial Administration in the Graduate School at Carnegie Mellon University from 1963 until 1968. In 1969 he accepted a position as Founding Dean of the new Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He accepted the position under the condition that the school would specialize in educating change agents, a type of manager which was badly needed in industry and not produced by any U.S. school of business at that time. He worked as a Professor of Management there until 1973. In 1983 he joined the U.S. International University (USIU, now Alliant International University) where he created the school's strategic management program. Igor Ansoff, 1971 Professionally, he is known worldwide for his research in three specific areas: *The concept of environmental turbulence;Ansoff, I.H. and McDonnell, E.J. (1990), \\"Implanting Strategic Management\\", 2nd Ed., Cambridge, Great Britain: Prentice Hall International (UK) Ltd. *The contingent strategic success paradigm, a concept that has been validated by numerous doctoral dissertations; *Real-time strategic management. Marketing and MBA students are usually familiar with his Ansoff Matrix, a tool he created to plot generic strategies for growing a business, via existing or new products, in existing or new markets. He has consulted with hundreds of multinational corporations including, Philips, General Electric, Gulf, IBM, Sterling Airlines and Westinghouse. To honor his body of work, the prestigious Igor Ansoff Award was established in 1981 in the Netherlands. The award is given for research and management in the study of Strategic Planning and Management. The Japan Strategic Management Society has also established an annual award in his name and Vanderbilt University has established an Ansoff MBA scholarship. He was awarded five honorary doctorate degrees over the years. Igor retired from USIU two years before his death as a distinguished professor emeritus. =Death= He died of complications from pneumonia in San Diego, California, on July 14, 2002. Survivors of his death included his wife; three sons, Rick, Chris, and Peter; and two grandchildren.

He was CEO and president of the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences (AAHS). Names Cinque has been known by the nicknames \\"the Preppy Don\\" and \\"Joey No Socks\\". In an April 1995 profile in New York magazine, Cinque was described as a \\"small-time mobster, a scam artist, and an art fence.\\" Career In 1980, Cinque was shot three times and left for dead. While Cinque described the incident as a robbery, officials indicated it was likely an attempted contract killing by the mafia. Stolen artworks Cinque was arrested in 1989 on felony charges when stolen art was found in his apartment. After police used a battering ram to gain access to his home, they found 40 works of art, including pieces by Joan Miró and Frederick Remington. Among the artworks were three pieces that had been stolen from Manhattan galleries in April. Cinque had two signed Marc Chagall prints in his possession that were valued at over $20,000 each and were stolen from the Center Art Gallery. He also had a $9000 sculpture by Cecille Schatzberg that had been stolen from the Lever Brothers Gallery. Authorities investigated Cinque's alleged role as a fence for an art theft ring. He was initially charged with criminal possession of stolen property. After an informant relayed a conversation that Cinque had with Gambino boss John Gotti where Gotti said that he would \\"take care of the D.A.\\" and the D.A.'s office was informed that Cinque had been dealing drugs out of his apartment, a felony charge was sought. Cinque pleaded guilty but did not serve any jail time. Cinque had previously been arrested for criminal possession of stolen property, insurance fraud, and grand larceny. In a memoir, New York plastic surgeon Richard Lawrence Dombroff related that Cinque said he had purchased stolen jewelry and stayed out of prison because he worked as an informant for the government. Businesses In partnership with Toby Beavers, Michael Ault, and Gary Pryor, Cinque ran the Surf Club and the Crane Club in New York. He said that he was Beavers' insurance policy against \\"trouble with the mob\\" at the Surf Club and the Zulu Lounge. Cinque helped launch the MercBar in 1993, representing the club before the State Liquor Authority. Hospitality academy and Donald Trump Cinque is President and CEO of the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences. The academy is run from Cinque's Central Park South apartment in Manhattan and has been cited for extensive connections to the friends and family of Donald Trump. He began the academy's Star Diamond Awards that he deemed the \\"Academy Awards\\" of hospitality. In 1989, he moved the organization from Chicago to New York and made its scope international. Personal life In 2006, Cinque was pulled over for driving under the influence. He refused a breathalyzer and failed a series of field sobriety tests. He was convicted but later appealed the ruling, with his physician testifying that Cinque had chronic lead poisoning due to \\"multiple lead pellets in his body.\\" Cinque's former girlfriend, Despina Zahariades, also alleged domestic abuse, saying that he beat her and took her for $60,000. Alongside Donald Trump Jr., Cinque served as a judge for the 2008 Miss Universe pageant. At a 2016 New Year's Eve celebration, Cinque awarded president-elect Donald Trump with a “a One-of-a-Kind bronze Eagle award” from the AAHS, where Trump had previously been a trustee. Cinque appeared alongside Trump at a New Year's Eve party on January 3, 2017.

The original incarnation comprised Peter Thomson (guitar, keyboards, synthesizer and vocals), Jack Ross (guitar, synthesizer and vocals), Jim Ross (bass guitar) and Carole L. Branston (keyboards and vocals). The band used a small pre-programmed drum machine. Career Before being named Secession, the band played at least one concert as the Gift, during which Jim Ross performed with one arm in a full plaster cast following an accident. After a performance at Buster Brown's nightclub in Edinburgh, the band were introduced to Hamish Brown, a local entrepreneur, who offered to manage them. This was followed by the addition of a fifth member, Alistair MacLeod (percussion and vocals), a friend of the original members who had provided the photograph for the sleeve of the band's independently released debut single \\"Betrayal\\". Shortly after recording demo material at Palladium Studios in Edinburgh, Jack Ross, disillusioned with the direction the music was taking, left the band. MacLeod was asked to divide his contribution between percussion and synthesizer/sequencing, and the band continued in this form for a short period of time until Jim Ross left, cutting the line-up to a trio. This was the unit that produced the original demo of \\"Fire Island\\" (based around two sequences programmed on a Yamaha DX7) at Planet Studios in Edinburgh, which came to the attention of the Beggars Banquet Records A&R; department. After being signed by Beggars Banquet, the trio re-recorded \\"Fire Island\\" at REL Studios in Edinburgh, later remixed by the production team associated with Freeez and John Rocca. Before its release, MacLeod left the band to concentrate on photography, and was replaced by Charlie D. Kelly. The final incarnation of Secession, associated with almost the entire released catalog, consisted of Thomson, Branston, Kelly, and J.L. Seenan.

Vine also played two Test matches for England and was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1906. Vine's cricket career was not one of a rapid rise to fame. Although he played his first first-class match in 1896, it was not until 1900, after some tentative appearances in the three previous seasons, that he earned a regular place in the Sussex eleven. After that, however, he was indispensable. He was essentially a county cricketer, nearly all his work having been done for Sussex, but if, in addition to his batting and fielding, he had managed to retain his skill as a leg-break bowler it is quite likely that he would have played for England before he played his two Test matches in 1911/2. Already a dependable player, he made a great advance as a batsman in 1904 and during 1905 he was better than he had ever been before, scoring for Sussex in county matches alone over sixteen hundred runs. Good as his position is he would probably have been thought still more of if he had belonged to another county. A batsman would need to be great indeed to play on the same side as Ranjitsinhji and C.B. Fry, and not be overshadowed. His success as a batsman was largely gained in a series of first-wicket partnerships with Fry, and though he may at times carry caution a little too far and keep an undue check on his hitting powers, the result is nearly always so satisfactory that it would be sheer hypercriticism to find fault with him. As an outfield Vine has not the wonderful pick-up of Denton, but in every other respect was in the highest class, and in the course of a season at the beginning of the twentieth century, perhaps no one saved a larger number of runs. In total Vine played 547 first-class matches, which included 421 consecutive appearances for Sussex. Soon after retiring from county cricket Joe Vine became coach at Brighton College, an office he held for many years. He died aged 70 in 1946.

It is located in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. Sriharikota Range was renamed in 2002 after ISRO's former chairman Satish Dhawan. SDSC's current director is Arumugam Rajarajan. He took over from S. Pandian in July 2019.  History  Sriharikota island was chosen in 1969 for a satellite launching station. The centre became operational in 1971 when an RH-125 sounding rocket was launched. The first attempted launch of an orbital satellite, Rohini 1A aboard a Satellite Launch Vehicle, took place on 10 August 1979, but due to a failure in thrust vectoring of the rocket's second stage, the satellite's orbit decayed on 19 August 1979. SHAR was named as 'Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR' (SDSC), on 5 September 2002, in memory of Satish Dhawan, former Chairman of the ISRO. The SHAR facility now consists of two launch pads, with the second built in 2005. The second launch pad was used for launches beginning in 2005 and is a universal launch pad, accommodating all of the launch vehicles used by ISRO. The two launch pads will allow multiple launches in a single year, which was not possible earlier. India's lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 launched from the centre at 6:22 AM IST on 22 October 2008. India's first Mars orbiter Mangalyaan was launched from the centre on 5 November 2013, which was successfully placed into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014. Initially under Indian Human Spaceflight Programme existing launch facilities will be augmented to meet the target of launching a crewed spacecraft called Gaganyaan. Location Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR) is located in Sriharikota, a spindle-shaped barrier island on the east coast of Andhra Pradesh. Features like a good launch azimuth corridor for various missions, nearness to the equator (benefiting eastward launches), and large uninhabited area for a safety zone make it an ideal spaceport. SHAR covers a total area of about with a coastal length of . Prior to its acquisition for ISRO by the Government of India, it was a firewood plantation of Eucalyptus and Casuarina trees. This island is affected by both south-westerly and north-easterly monsoons, but heavy rains come only in October and November. Thus many clear days are available for out-door static tests and launchings. Sriharikota Launching Range-Source Bharatrakshak.com SHAR is linked to Sullurupeta by a road across Pulicat Lake. Sullurupeta has connectivity with other parts of India by Indian Railways and is on a National Highway 5 (India) that connects it to Chennai (about south) and Kolkata. Launch history Originally known as the Sriharikota Range (SHAR) and later named after Satish Dhawan. It is India's primary orbital launch site to this day. First flight-test of 'Rohini-125', a small sounding rocket which took place on 9 October 1971 was the first ever rocket launch from SHAR. Since then technical, logistic and administrative infrastructure have been enhanced. Together with the northerly Balasore Rocket Launching Station, the facilities are operated under the ISRO Range Complex (IREX) headquartered at SHAR. Unveiling of the Bust of Satish Dhawan at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota & Presentation of Astronautical Society of India Awards by Prime Minister-Press Release, Date Released: Wednesday, 21 September 2005, Source: Indian Space Research Organisation =Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV)= The range became operational when three Rohini 125 sounding rockets were launched on 9 and 10 October 1971. Previously, India used Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS), at Thiruvananthapuram, on the south-western coast of India, to launch sounding rockets. The first test launch of the complete SLV-3 rocket occurred in August 1979 but it was only partially successful following a malfunction in the second-stage guidance system. SHAR facilities worked satisfactorily during the SLV-3 preparation and launch. On 18 July 1980 the SLV-3 successfully launched India's third satellite. Out of the four SLV launches from SHAR, two were successful. =Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV)= The ASLV orbital launcher was integrated vertically, beginning with motor and subassembly preparations in the Vehicle Integration Building (VIB) and completed on the pad within the 40 m tall Mobile Service Structure. The first ASLV launch from SHAR took place in 1987 and resulted in a failure. Eventually, out the four ASLV launches from 1987–94, only one was successful. =Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)= The PSLV launch complex was commissioned during 1990. It has a 3,000 tonne, 76.5 m high Mobile Service Tower (MST) which provides the SP-3 payload clean room. The solid propellant motors for the PSLV are processed by SHAR, which also carries out launch operations. The first launch of the PSLV took place on 20 September 1993. Facilities The SDSC has two operational orbital launch pads. SHAR is ISRO's satellite launching base and additionally provides launch facilities for the full range of Rohini sounding rockets. The Vehicle Assembly, Static Test and Evaluation Complex (VAST, previously STEX) and the Solid Propellant Space Booster Plant (SPROB) are located at SHAR for casting and testing solid motors. The site also has a Telemetry, Tracking, Range Instrumentation, & Control centre for Range Operation (RO), Liquid Propellant Storage and Servicing Facilities (LSSF), the Management Service Group and Sriharikota Common Facilities. The PSLV launch complex was commissioned in 1990. It has a 3,000 tonne, 76.5 m high Mobile Service Tower (MST) which provides the SP-3 payload clean room. Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota Range (SHAR) (India), Civil space organisations – Launch facilities, Source – Jane's Information Group The Solid Propellant Space Booster Plant (SPROB) processes large size propellant grains for the satellite launch vehicles. The Vehicle Assembly & Launching Facility (VALF), Solid Motor Preparation & Environmental Testing Facility (SMP&ETF;) tests and qualifies different types of solid motor for launch vehicles. The control centre at SHAR houses computers and data processing, closed circuit television, real-time tracking systems and meteorological observation equipment. It is linked to eight radars located at Sriharikota and the five stations of ISRO's Telemetry, Tracking & Command Network (ISTRAC). The propellant production plant produces composite solid propellant for rocket motors of ISRO using ammonium perchlorate (oxidiser), fine aluminium powder (fuel) and hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (binder). The solid motors processed here include those for the first-stage booster motor of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) — a five segmented motor of diameter and length, weighing with a thrust level of . Rocket motors and their subsystems have to be rigorously tested and evaluated on ground before they are declared flight worthy. The facilities at SDSC are used for testing solid rocket motors, both at ambient conditions and simulated high altitude conditions. Besides these, there are facilities for conducting vibration, shock, constant acceleration and thermal/humidity tests. SDSC has infrastructure for launching satellites into low Earth orbit, polar orbit and geo-stationary transfer orbit. The launch complexes provide support for vehicle assembly, fueling, checkout and launch operations. The Centre also has facilities for launching sounding rockets for atmospheric studies. The mobile service tower, launch pad, preparation facilities for different launch stages & spacecraft, storage, transfer and servicing facilities for liquid propellants, etc., are the principal parts of the PSLV/GSLV launch complex. For supporting the GSLV Mark III, additional facilities were set up at SDSC. A new plant (SPP) is set up to process heavier class boosters with 200 tonnes of Solid propellant. The static test complex is being augmented for qualifying the S-200 booster. Other new facilities include a Solid Stage Assembly Building, Satellite Preparation and Filling Facility and Hardware Storage buildings. The existing liquid propellant and cryogenic propellant storage and filling systems, Propellant Servicing Facilities will also be augmented. The range instrumentation system will be enhanced further. SDSC also has a S band Doppler weather radar that contributes to India Meteorological Department radar network and serves as a stand-in for Doppler weather radar in Chennai. ISRO opened a viewing gallery at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in March 2019. The gallery faces the two launchpads and can accommodate 5,000 people giving the general public the opportunity to witness rocket launches. The launch of PSLV-C45 on 1 April 2019 was the first launch that allowed spectators into the gallery.

It was used by two launch vehicles of the ISRO: the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) and the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV). Initially it was built for launching SLV-3s but was later also used as an ASLV launch complex. The first launch from this pad occurred on 10 August 1979, and was that of the first experimental flight of SLV-3 carrying the Rohini Technology Payload satellite. The last flight was of ASLV on 4 May 1994 carrying SROSS-C2. = First Launch Pad = The First Launch Pad began operation in 1993. It is currently used by two launch vehicles of the ISRO: the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). It is one of two operational orbital launch pads at the site, the other being the Second Launch Pad, which opened in 2005. The first launch from this pad occurred on 20 September 1993, and was the maiden flight of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle carrying the IRS-1E satellite. The First Launch Pad is undergoing major expansion with PIF (PSLV Integration Facilities) project worth . Once complete, the first launch pad is expected to cater to around 15 launches per year. = Second Launch Pad = The Second Launch Pad was designed, supplied, erected and commissioned by MECON Limited, a Government of Indian Enterprise, located at Ranchi (Jharkhand, India) during the period March 1999 to December 2003. It cost about at that time.http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081023/jsp/jharkhand/story_10006297.jsp The second launch pad with associated facilities was built in 2005. However it became operational on 5 May 2005 with the launching of PSLV-C6. MECON's sub- contractors for this project including Inox India, HEC, Tata Growth, Goderej Boyce, Simplex, Nagarjuna Construction, Steelage, etc. The other Launch Pad being the First Launch Pad. It is used by Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles, Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicles, GSLV Mark III and is intended for India's first manned space mission. The first launch from the pad occurred on 5 May 2005, and was of a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle carrying the CARTOSAT-1 and HAMSAT satellites. India's 1st Moon Mission, Chandrayan-I was launched from this launch pad on 22 October 2008. Its follow-up mission Chandrayaan-2 was also launched from this launch pad on 22 July 2019. The most recent launch was of a PSLV-XL on 27 November 2019. In November 2019, ISRO released tenders for augmentation of SLP for Gaganyaan project. = Third Launch Pad = Construction of the Third Launch Pad began in September 2012. Several facilities have been proposed to be built at the Third Launch Pad. They include a vehicle assembly building, mobile pedestals, umbilical towers, emergency exits, ground escape system, crew ingress and egress systems, safety bunkers, material handling equipment and related electrical systems.This section contains public domain text which were published by the Press Trust of India. The total cost of the new launch pad is estimated to be . This launch pad is intended to be used for future Indian rockets like the Unified Launch Vehicle and GSLV Mark III as well as the older ones like Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle. The launch pad will be used for the India's future human space missions. One of the main reasons of building this launch pad is that it will increase the frequency of orbital launches by ISRO. In 2018, it was reported that the launch of India's first crewed orbital spacecraft \\"Gaganyaan\\" is scheduled to be launch from the third launch pad before 2022. However in November 2019, ISRO released tenders for augmentation of Second Launch Pad for Gaganyaan project.

It is a narrow, isolated limestone ridge with a length of and six peaks. Located some south east of Civita Castellana and c. north of Rome, it is the sole notable ridge in the Tiber Valley. The nearest settlement is the village of Sant'Oreste. Saint Orestes or Edistus, after whom the settlement is named, is said to have been martyred near Monte Soratte. The highest summit is above sea-level. The ridge is part of a Natural Reserve housing a variety of vegetation and fauna. It is also characterized by the so- called Meri, pits which can be up to deep. History and sights The area was used by the ancient Italic peoples of the area (Sabines, Capenates, Falisci) and the Etruscan civilization for the cult of the God Soranus. Mount Soratte was mentioned by Horace (\\"vides ut alta stet nive candidum Soracte?\\" Carm. i. 9), and Virgil, who stated that Apollo was its guardian deity. The hermitage of St. Sylvester is just below the summit. According to a legend, its church was founded by Pope Sylvester, who had taken refuge there to escape Constantine's persecution. The church houses 14th- and 15th-century frescoes. Another four hermitages are on the ridge. The church of Santa Maria delle Grazie was built in 1835 over a pre-existing 16th-century edifice and houses a once highly venerated image of the Madonna. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe mentioned the peak in Italian Journey, his diary of his travels through Italy from 1786–1788. He wrote that \\"Soracte stands out by itself in magnificent solitude. Probably this mountain is made of limestone and belongs to the Apennines.\\" During World War II, after the 8 September 1943 Frascati air raid, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring moved his headquarters from Frascati to the bunkers in Monte Soratte.

History The board was established by the 1934 amendments to the Railway Labor Act of 1926 and is headed by a three- person panel of Presidential appointees. NMB programs provide an integrated dispute resolution process to meet the statutory objective of minimizing strikes and other work stoppages in the airline and railroad industries. The NMB's integrated processes specifically are designed to promote three statutory goals: * The prompt and orderly resolution of disputes arising out of the negotiation of new or revised collective bargaining agreements; * The effectuation of employee rights of self-organization where a representation dispute exists; and * The prompt and orderly resolution of disputes over the interpretation or application of existing agreements. Contracts Under the Railway Labor Act, an airline or railroad union contract does not expire; it remains in force and amendable until a new contract is ratified by the union members or either side exercises \\"self-help,\\" which could be a strike by employees or a lockout by management. Before this can happen, the NMB- appointed mediator must declare an impasse in negotiations, which starts a 30-day cooling off period, during which negotiations continue. Once the 30-day period has passed, either side is free to exercise self-help, unless the President authorizes a Presidential Emergency Board. The US Congress also has the power to impose a contract, but that has rarely happened in recent years.

He also made metrical versions of the Iliad, the Prometheus of Æschylus, the Canzoniere of Petrarch. The translations from the Greek are a laboured attempt to mirror the versification rules of the originals. His version of The Divine Comedy is much more successful, preserving the Dante's terza rima rhyme scheme while using a relatively simple English which reflects Dante's own use of ordinary Italian. Charles Bagot Cayley also published a collection of his own poems, Psyche's Interludes. From Mr Pollecary's school, Blackheath, Charles Cayley went to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1845 with a BA in the classical tripos. He also studied at King's College London, under Gabriele Rossetti. In his youth he obtained a post in the Patent Office, but gave this up when he embarked on an early venture into billboard advertising at railway stations. The venture was ahead of its time and he lost most of his money. The rest of his life he spent in relative poverty. The accounts of William Michael Rossetti (brother of Christina) portray him as a shy and unworldly intellectual with a cerebral sense of humour. He was a leading figure in the London Philological Society. He is said to have been asked by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge to translate the New Testament into Iroquois; not knowing Iroquois, he allegedly learnt sufficient of the language in one month to be able to complete the task. He was born in St Petersburg, the son of a Russian merchant. He fell in love with the poet Christina Rossetti, proposing in 1866, but she felt unable to marry him because he was an agnostic (she was a High Church Anglican). They remained close friends until his death, and several of her poems were written with him in mind. His brother was the mathematician Arthur Cayley.

He is known for his widely anthologized short story \\"How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife,\\" the main story in the collection How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife and Other Short Stories, which won first prize in the Commonwealth Literary Contest in 1940. His stories \\"Midsummer\\" and \\"Heat\\" were published in Tondo, Manila by the Prairie Schooner. Most of Arguilla's stories depict scenes in Barrio Nagrebcan, Bauang, La Union, where he was born. His bond with his birthplace, forged by his dealings with the peasant folk of Ilocos, remained strong even after he moved to Manila, where he studied at the University of the Philippines, finished his BS in Education in 1933, and became a member and later the president of the U.P. Writer's Club and editor of the university's Literary Apprentice. He married Lydia Villanueva, another talented writer in English, and they lived in Ermita, Manila. Here, F. Sionil José, another seminal Filipino writer in English, recalls often seeing him in the National Library, which was then in the basement of what is now the National Museum. \\"You couldn't miss him\\", José describes Arguilla, \\"because he had this black patch on his cheek, a birthmark or an overgrown mole.

He was later appointed to the Board of Censors. He secretly organized a guerrilla intelligence unit against the Japanese. On August 5, 1944, he was captured and tortured by the Japanese army at Fort Santiago. In one account, he was later transferred to the grounds of the Manila Chinese Cemetery. Along with him were guerrilla leaders, along with more than 10 men. They were then asked to dig their own graves, after which, they were immediately, one by one, beheaded with swords. His remains, as well as the others', have never been recovered, as they were dumped into one unmarked grave. The remains of the executed men were said to be located and identified by their compatriots after the war, after a Japanese-American officer (working in the Japanese Army as a spy), revealed what he had seen and the location of the grave after the executions of August 30 of 1944.

He attended the University of Chicago, where he won varsity letters in three sports. Hinkle captained the Chicago Maroons basketball team for two seasons was twice selected as an All-American, in 1919 and 1920. After graduating from the University of Chicago, Hinkle moved on to Butler University as a coach. There, over the course of nearly 50 years, he served as the head football coach (1926, 1935–1941, 1946–1969), head basketball coach (1926–1942, 1945–1970), and head baseball coach (1921–1928, 1933–1941, 1946–1970). Hinkle was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor in 1965. Butler's home basketball arena was renamed as Hinkle Fieldhouse in the coach's honor in 1966. Early life and playing career Hinkle was born in Logansport, Indiana, to Edgar Clayton and Winnie (Ray) Hinkle. He graduated in 1917 from Calumet High School in Chicago, Illinois, and attended the University of Chicago from 1917 to 1921. As a player at Chicago, he lettered three times in basketball, was twice All-Big Ten, twice team captain, named to the Helms All-America team in 1919 and 1920, was a member of the Big Ten Conference championship team in 1919–20, losing the national championship to Penn. Coaching career Hinkle joined Butler University in 1921 when they were still at the Irvington campus; the university bought Fairview Park in 1922 and moved the campus there in 1928. At Butler, Hinkle served as a teacher, coach and athletic administrator for nearly half a century. While he coached football, basketball, and baseball, he was primarily known as a basketball coach. His teams were fearless, gaining a reputation as \\"Big Ten killers\\". In 1929, the Butler Bulldogs basketball team he led to a 17–2 record was crowned national champion; in 1924, he had been assistant coach when they received similar honors. Overall, his basketball teams scored 560 victories versus 392 defeats, and he scored more than 1,000 victories in all sports. Hinkle was instrumental in ending the rule providing for a jump ball after every basket, and in the introduction of the three- second rule. Basketballs were generally brown until Hinkle introduced the orange basketball in the late 1950s. He also came up with the \\"Hinkle System\\" offense strategy, based on a complex system of motion, passes, picks and screens; it was adopted by many of the over 200 high school and college coaches trained by Hinkle. Hinkle was president of the National Association of Basketball Coaches from 1954 to 1955, and served on their board. He won the NABC's top award in 1962 for contributions to the betterment of the game of basketball. He was named Chairman of the Rules Committee of the National Basketball Committee of the U.S. and Canada. Hinkle was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1965, the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1964, and the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1974. Hinkle's legacy is remembered on the Butler campus with Hinkle Fieldhouse, longtime site of Indiana's state high school championships and featured in the film Hoosiers. The fieldhouse, originally named Butler Fieldhouse, was the largest basketball arena in the United States for decades. It was renamed as Hinkle Fieldhouse in 1966. Hinkle coached 41 seasons of basketball at Butler, ending in 1970, and remained with Butler University until his death in 1992.

It is situated opposite Linköping Castle. History The present church is about 800 years old. However, its history starts in the 11th century, with the construction of a wooden church. Later, around 1120, a stone church was built, a basilica of about half the size of the present building. Around 1230 it became necessary to construct a larger church, as the basilica had become too small. The church was extended to the east, with a new choir and transept. These parts remain as part of the present church. The current altarpiece is also from that period. The next extension of the church was made following the coronation of King Valdemar, in 1251. The main building was now constructed, and the church received its current length of 110 meters. The height of the tower is . At the beginning of the 15th century, 1408–1420, the Gothic chapels were constructed, with large windows and star-shaped vaults. The chapels were named after Saint Andrew (later renamed after Saint Mary), Saint Nicolaus Hermanni (Nils Hermansson) and Saint Thomas Becket. Fire damaged the roof of the church in 1546 and again in 1567. The tower was rebuilt between 1747 and 1758 and again between 1877 and 1886 by Helgo Zettervall. In 1967 the shape of the 17th-century roof was restored. It is covered with copper sheeting, the corrosion of which has created the green color. The cathedral is featured on the cover of the album Opus Eponymous by Ghost, whose founder, Tobias Forge, is a native of Linköping.

Biography Self-described \\"artivists\\", Massimo and Pierce, met on October 26, 2001 on the set of an underground pornographic film in which both were performing. The pair, who had both worked as male sex-workers since their teens, formed a romantic and artistic relationship which cumulated in the formation of the queer, post-industrial Black Sun Productions collective. The pair also operated Zurich-based queer sexual fetish clubs and engaged in collaborations with a diverse range of artists including Coil, Lydia Lunch and H.R. Giger. The Black Sun Productions collective have a long-standing commitment to the exploration of altered state of consciousness, esoteric sexual practices, anarchist political theory and practice, DIY ethics, anti-fascism and anti-racist movements. =Personal lives= Massimo and Pierce, who are primarily based in Switzerland, were married in Zurich on December 1, 2003. Plastic Spider Thing and collaboration with Coil Massimo and Pierce had previously been well known as artists in Switzerland and Italy; however, in 2002, the pair gained international attention when their ritual performance piece, Plastic Spider Thing, was included in industrial band Coil's European and Scandinavian tour. Black Sun Productions explained Plastic Spider Thing as \\" A highly moral, yet sexually explicit exploration into the relationship between the spider and the fly\\", whilst Brainwashed.com described the performance as \\"The sex act turned into a sadomasochistic, predatory dance of sorts.\\" Plastic Spider Thing included performance art from Massimo and Pierce, accompanied by loops and fragments of numerous Coil works that created a multi-layered electronic 'dronewerk', created by the third member of the Black Sun Productions artistic collective, DraZen. Coil members Jhonn Balance and Peter Christopherson were introduced to \\"Plastic Spider Thing\\" while receiving a demonstration of various pieces of bondage paraphernalia at a private ceremony at Massimo and Pierce's fetish club in Zurich, Switzerland. Balance and Christopherson, who were impressed by Black Sun Productions, signed the group to Coil's Eskaton label and subsequently invited the collective to support their 2002 tour. Following the 2002 Coil tour, Black Sun Productions continued performing throughout Europe. The collective performed a 23-part performance and installation art tour, based on the original \\"Plastic Spider Thing\\" concept. The tour's performances were often considered controversial as they included elements of chaos magick and ritualized sex magick that involved nudity and explicitly sexual material, such as urination. Almotriptan in Athos (or A Well Hung Monk), a film directed by Daniel McKernan, commemorating Black Sun Productions' eleventh Plastic Spider Thing performance in Coil's English home, \\"The North Tower\\", on August 23, 2002, was completed in 2008. A Well Hung Monk has been shown in Turin, Italy at the 24th Torino Film Festival: \\"From Sodom to Hollywood\\" and at TLV International LGBT Film Festival in Tel Aviv, Israel. The film was also included in the 25th New York Queer Experimental Film Festival as part of the program \\"X Marks the Spot\\" on October 17, 2012. =Controversy= On March 31, 2003, Black Sun Productions' offices in Zurich were raided by the vice squad of the Zurich metropolitan police as a result of claims that the collective were in possession of items promoting \\"deviant or lurid sexual activity\\". Computers, cameras, tapes, DVDs, magazines and pictures were confiscated by police in order to be copied and investigated. The Black Sun Productions collective was charged with possessing and producing \\"illegal pornography\\". According to Swiss laws any picture showing human excrement, including urine, is considered illegal pornography. A fundraising campaign by fellow artists was launched to support the Black Sun Productions collective's legal costs. Astral Walk and Toilet Chant In 2004, Black Sun Productions issued two CDs, Astral Walk and Toilet Chant. OperettAmorale In 2005 Massimo and Pierce released a new album, OperettAmorale. OperretAmorale is the fifth official release by Black Sun Productions and it features Massimo and Pierce paying homage to the poetry of German poet, playwright and thinker Bertolt Brecht (1898 - 1956). As many of Brecht's lyrics explored themes of human sexuality, morality and prostitution, Brecht was an influence on both men's lives from an early age. OperettAmorale features Brecht's original work retranslated by guest musicians including Coil (contributing a version of \\"A List of Wishes\\", recorded by John Balance prior to his death), Lydia Lunch (providing vocals to \\"The Ballad Of Sexual Dependency\\") and H. R. Giger (performing \\"Seeräuber-Jenny\\" in addition to providing a cover image for the album). Massimo and Pierce have also collaborated with the Italian industrial music producer Mariae Nascenti in live performances and on the CDs Morituri Te Salutant and Anarcadian Night. In 2006, Black Sun Productions released the double album titled The Impossibility of Silence, featuring Massimo and Pierce and guest artists such as Lydia Lunch, Val Denham, Sudden Infant and Sonne Hagal. Throughout the year the collective played a number of live performances including \\"Darkness Is Enlightening\\" at Paradiso, Amsterdam, on a multiple bill with Psychic TV, Lydia Lunch and Val Denham. Chemism and Dies Juvenalis On 23 April 2007 Black Sun Productions ceased to be a collective. Down to a duo, Massimo and Pierce released the album Chemism in April, 2007. A follow-up EP, Dies Juvenalis, was also released and the duo gave a number of live performances at venues including the Transformer Festival in Biel, Switzerland (with Val Denham), the IV Congresso Post Industriale in Prato, Italy and the Dada Industrial Nights in Pavia, Italy. A numbered edition of 23 cdr copies, wrapped in gauze fabric were created for Lady Day Lord Night, a contemporary art group exhibition/event co-curated by Andrew Zealley and Chrysanne Stathacos, and staged simultaneously at Art Metropole (Toronto)/Printed Matter Inc (New York City). In November 2007, Massimo & Pierce's short film Uncle Billy was premiered in New York City at the 20th MIX Festival. Two compilations featuring Black Sun Productions' tracks were released in 2007: Radio Interference from Unknown Orgasm (Somnimage) and Old Europa Cafe (OEC100). Phantasmata Domestica Phantasmata Domestica, an album which took three years to complete, was recorded between New York City, Zurich, London and Barcelona. The album, which is dedicated to the memory of Coil's Peter \\"Sleazy\\" Christopherson, features performances by Lydia Lunch, Othon, Cory Smythe, Fung Chern Hwei, Sirius Quartet and Michael Bates. Black Sum Productions have described the album as \\"an epic and emotional tale about sorrow and loss\\". Phantasmata Domestica, which was released in July, 2012, was co-produced by Mikael Karlsson and Massimo and Pierce. Disbanding of Black Sun Productions On May 3, 2012, Massimo and Pierce issued a press release through the Anarcocks website stating that Black Sun Productions would disband on December 20, 2012. The press release stated: \\"Dear all, on the eve of 20/12/2012, Black Sun Productions will cease to exist. Phantasmata Domestica, our collaborative work with Mikael Karlsson to be released this year, will be the final Black Sun Productions studio album. (...)It has been a decade of exciting actions and productions. We met many lovely individuals, amazing people and we are thankful for each and every day we've spent creating and performing. As we decide to terminate this mission, there is no sadness in our souls but gratefulness and a feeling of achievement. This is not the last you will hear from the two of us.

It is the remains of a fortified settlement dating to the Bronze Age, c. 2800–1600 BC, and is the type site of the Sintashta culture. The site has been characterised \\"fortified metallurgical industrial center\\". Sintashta is situated in the steppe just east of the Ural Mountains. The site is named for the adjacent Sintashta River, a tributary to the Tobol. The shifting course of the river over time has destroyed half of the site, leaving behind thirty one of the approximately fifty or sixty houses in the settlement. The settlement consisted of rectangular houses arranged in a circle 140 m in diameter and surrounded by a timber-reinforced earthen wall with gate towers and a deep ditch on its exterior. The fortifications at Sintashta and similar settlements such as Arkaim were of unprecedented scale for the steppe region. There is evidence of copper and bronze metallurgy taking place in every house excavated at Sintashta, again an unprecedented intensity of metallurgical production for the steppe. Early Abashevo culture ceramic styles strongly influenced Sintashta ceramics. Due to the assimilation of tribes in the region of the Urals, such as the Pit-grave, Catacomb, Poltavka, and northern Abashevo into the Novokumak horizon, it would seem inaccurate to provide Sintashta with a purely Aryan attribution.Elena E. Kuz'mina, The Origin of the Indo-Iranians, Volume 3, edited by J. P. Mallory, Brill NV, Leiden, 2007, p 222 In the origin of Sintashta, the Abashevo culture would play an important role. Five cemeteries have been found associated with the site, the largest of which (known as Sintashta mogila or SM) consisted of forty graves. Some of these were chariot burials, producing the oldest known chariots in the world. Others included horse sacrifices—up to eight in a single grave—various stone, copper and bronze weapons, and silver and gold ornaments. The SM cemetery is overlain by a very large kurgan of a slightly later date. It has been suggested that the kind of funerary sacrifices evident at Sintashta have strong similarities to funerary rituals described in the Rig Veda, an ancient Indian religious text often associated with the Proto-Indo-Iranians. Radiocarbon dates from the settlement and cemeteries span over a millennium, suggesting an earlier occupation belonging to the Poltavka culture. The majority of the dates, however, are around 2100–1800 BC, which points at a main period of occupation of the site consistent with other settlements and cemeteries of the Sintashta culture.

It was discovered in 1987 by a team of archaeologists led by Gennady Zdanovich, preventing the planned flooding of the area for the creation of a reservoir. Arkaim is attributed to the early Proto-Indo-Iranian of the Sintashta culture, which some scholars believe represents the proto-Indo-Iranians before their split into different groups and migration to Central Asia and from there to Persia and India and other parts of Eurasia. Discovery and salvage of the site In the summer of 1987 a team of archaeologists headed by Gennady Zdanovich was sent to examine the archaeological value of the valley at the confluence of the Bolshaya Karaganka and Utyaganka rivers, in the south of Chelyabinsk Oblast or the Southern Ural region, where the construction of a reservoir had begun the previous autumn. Some archaeological sites in the area were already known, but they had yielded little and were not considered worthy of preservation. The site would have been flooded by the spring of 1988. On June 20, two students who took part in the expedition, Aleksandr Voronkov and Aleksandr Ezril, informed the archaeologists about unusual embankments they had found in the steppe. The same evening Zdanovich announced the discovery. The latter would have proven a turning point in the debates about the original homeland of the Indo-Europeans and their migrations, which Soviet specialists had been bitterly disputing about since the 1970s. The near Sintashta culture, excavated in that decade, yielded the remains of an early chariot with horses, making apparent that the southern Urals had been a key location in the development of technology and complex civilisation. The discovery of Arkaim confirmed that assumption. The struggle to rescue the site was difficult since the reservoir project was overseen by the then all-powerful Ministry of Water Resources of the Soviet Union. The project was scheduled for completion in 1989, but the builders intended to hasten the construction to have it built within the spring of 1988. The archaeologists did their best to mobilise public opinion for the rescue of Arkaim, initially requesting a halt of the project until 1990; academicians and public figures spoke out in their defense. In March 1989 the Praesidium of the Urals Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union formally established a scientific laboratory for the study of the ancient civilisation of Chelyabinsk Oblast. A request was made to the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation to declare the site as a protected area of historical value. In the following months the Ministry of Water Resources rapidly lost power as the Soviet Union moved towards collapse. In April 1991 the Council of Ministers officially cancelled the construction of the reservoir and declared Arkaim a \\"historical and geographical museum\\". Structure of Arkaim View of the Arkaim site and the surrounding landscape Reconstruction of the Arkaim settlement. Arkaim was a circular stronghold consisting of two concentric bastions made of adobe with timber frames, and covered with unfired clay bricks. Within the circles, close to the bastions, sixty dwellings stood, The dwellings had hearths, cellars, wells and metallurgical furnaces. They opened towards an inner circular street paved with wood. The street was lined by a covered drainage gutter with pits for water collection. At the centre of the complex was a rectangular open space. The complex had four entrances, consisting of intricately constructed passages and oriented towards the cardinal points. According to V. A. Shnirelman, @ All the evidence suggests that the settlement had been built to a common plan, which is indicative of a society with a developed social structure and local leaders with high authority.\\" Scholars have identified the structure of Arkaim as the cities built \\"reproducing the model of the universe\\" described in ancient Aryan/Iranian spiritual literature, the Vedas and the Avesta. The structure consists of three concentric rings of walls and three radial streets, reflecting the city of King Yima described in the Rigveda. The foundation walls and the dwellings of the second ring are built according to what some researchers have described as swastika-like patterns; the same symbol is found on various artifacts. The fortified citadel of Arkaim dates back to the 17th and 16th century BCE. More than twenty other structures built according to similar patterns have been found in a larger area spanning from the southern Urals' region to the north of Kazakhstan, forming the so- called \\"Land of Towns\\". =Measures= Arkaim site excavation and partial building reconstruction The settlement covered approximately . The diameter of the enclosing wall was about , and its thickness was of . The height was . The settlement was surrounded with a -deep moat. There were four gates, the main was the western one. The dwellings were between in area. The dwellings of the outer ring were thirty-nine or forty, with doors opening towards the circular street. The dwellings of the inner ring numbered twenty-seven, arranged along the inner wall, with doors opening towards the central square, which was about in area. Zdanovich estimates that approximately 1,500 to 2,500 people could have lived in Arkaim. Surrounding Arkaim's walls, were arable fields, 130–140 metres by 45 metres (430–460 feet by 150 feet), irrigated by a system of canals and ditches. Social impactReligious movements and mysticism= Ritual spirals of stones made by Rodnovers in the areas around Arkaim. The discovery of Arkaim reinvigorated the debate about the original homeland of the Indo-Europeans, seemingly confirming its location in central Eurasia. After their discovery, Arkaim and the Land of Towns have been presented as the \\"land of the Aryans\\", the centre of a statehood of a monarchical type, and ultimately the model for a new spiritual civilisation harmonised with the universe. Agencies related to the Russian Orthodox Church have been critical of such activities of Arkaim's archaeology. The discovery of Arkaim and the Land of Towns has fueled the growth of schools of thought among Rodnovers, Rerikhians, Zoroastrians and other movements which regard the archaeological site as the second homeland of the Aryans, who originally dwelt in Arctic regions and migrated southwards when the weather there became glacial, then spreading from central Eurasia to the east, south and west, founding other civilisations. According to them, all Vedic knowledge originated in the southern Urals. Some of them identify Arkaim as the Asgard of Odin spoken of in Germanic literature. The Russian Zoroastrian movement identifies Arkaim as the place where Zoroaster was born. Arkaim is designated as a \\"national and spiritual shrine\\" of Russia and has become a holy site for Rodnover, Zoroastrian and other religious movements. =Vladimir Putin's visit and the \\"Russian idea\\"= Russia's president Vladimir Putin visited the site in 2005, meeting in person with the chief archaeologist Gennady Zdanovich. The visit received much attention from Russian media. They presented Arkaim as the \\"homeland of the majority of contemporary people in Asia, and, partly, Europe\\". Nationalists called Arkaim the \\"city of Russian glory\\" and the \\"most ancient Slavic-Aryan town\\". Zdanovich reportedly presented Arkaim to the president as a possible \\"national idea of Russia\\", a new idea of civilisation which Shnirelman calls the \\"Russian idea\\".

He used the Drummond light which was employed in the trigonometrical survey of Great Britain and Ireland. He is sometimes mistakenly given credit for the invention of limelight, at the expense of Sir Goldsworthy Gurney. It was Drummond, however, who realised its value in surveying.  Early life  Drummond was the second of three sons. Despite his father dying when he was young, he credited his mother with getting him through his education at Edinburgh High School and then on to be a Royal Engineer cadet at Woolwich Academy in 1813. He showed an early gift for mathematics. After Woolwich he was stationed in Edinburgh and was involved with public works. He was bored with this and had enrolled at Lincolns Inn when he was recruited to use his trigonometry to help conduct a survey in the Highlands. This new work was done in the summer with the more difficult months being passed in London. Drummond took this opportunity to improve his knowledge of mathematics and science. He attended lectures by Sir Michael Faraday. At these he learned of the discovery of limelight.  Ordnance Survey of Ireland  In 1824 Drummond was transferred to the new Ordnance Survey of Ireland and here he used the new Drummond light. He reported that the light could be observed 68 miles away and would cast a strong shadow at a distance of thirteen miles. Drummond left Ireland for a period prior to the Reform Bill of 1832. For his services to the Whigs, acting as secretary to Lord Spencer, Lord Brougham had him awarded a pension 300 pounds per annum. In 1835 Drummond, now back with the Irish Survey, married the wealthy heiress Maria Kinnaird, who was the adopted daughter of the critic Conversation Sharp (1759–1835). They had three children, Emily, Mary and Fanny.  Appointment as Irish under-secretary  He was then appointed to the significant post of Irish under-secretary, heading up the administration in Dublin Castle, a position he held from 1835 until his death in 1840. A supporter of the Whigs, Drummond was held in high regard by Irish, whom he treated with impartiality.1907 edition of The Nuttall Encyclopædia Drummond died in 1840 and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin. It was concluded by his family physician, Dr. Johnson, who spent his last days with Drummond, that he was afflicted with peritonitis, which was symptomatic of an undetermined medical cause. It is believed by some that overwork and stress precipitated his premature death in 1840 after working unceasingly for five years as Irish under-secretary. His dying words were reported as: Drummond was critical of the system of large estates (\\"landlordism\\") in Ireland and famously stated, \\"Property has its duties as well as its rights.\\"  See also  * Timeline of hydrogen technologies  Notes  References  * *  Further reading   * Category:1797 births Category:1840 deaths Category:Scottish civil engineers Category:Graduates of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich Category:Royal Engineers officers Category:Burials at Mount Jerome Cemetery and Crematorium Category:People from Edinburgh Category:Scottish surveyors Category:Under-Secretaries for Ireland ","title":"Thomas Drummond"},{"id":"2496742","text":"Gregory William Orr (born 6 August 1954 in Los Angeles) is an American writer and director of documentary and fiction films.

They arose in response to a feeling as to the inadequacy of the orthodox Sunday Schools as a training ground for the children of socialists and of the need for some organised and systematic method of presenting the socialist point of view and of teaching the ideals and principles of socialism to the children, youths and maidens in the country. In the United States of America a radical Sunday School movement linked to the German-American socialist movement emerged in New York and Chicago in the 1880s and again on a broader scale as part of the Modern School Movement during the first decade of the 20th Century. An even larger network of American Socialist Sunday Schools, closely paralleling the British movement, was launched by members of the Socialist Party of America during the first two decades of the 20th Century. Socialist Sunday Schools in Great BritainHistory= The earliest use of secular Sunday Schools by the radical movement began in Great Britain in the early 1830s, when adherents of Robert Owen and Chartism opened Sunday training schools for their children.James C. Docherty, \\"Socialist Sunday Schools,\\" in Historical Dictionary of Socialism. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 1997; pg. 218. These schools continued to operate until sometime in the decade of the 1850s, fizzling out with the decline of the early radical movement. For a generation, no such schools existed in Great Britain. Only in 1886 did Socialist Sunday Schools begin to reemerge in Great Britain. The institution was popularized by Mary Gray in 1892, a member of the Social Democratic Federation, who ran a soup kitchen for the children of the dock strike. Her aim, on realising they had little or no education, was to influence and educate them and make them aware of their socialist responsibilities and provide what was lacking in their day schools. She started the first Sunday with only one other besides her own two children but twenty years later there were approximately one hundred and twenty schools throughout the country, twenty of them being in London itself. In 1894, another Socialist Sunday School was created by trade unionist Tom Anderson. By 1912 there were over 200 Socialist Sunday Schools throughout Britain. In their early days they encountered opposition from local authorities and politicians, who argued that Socialist Sunday Schools were subverting the minds of young people with political and anti-religious doctrines and teachings. A national movement, the National Council of British Socialist Sunday Schools Union, formed in 1909, however, traces its origin to a school opened in Glasgow by Caroline Martyn and Archie McArthur. It was established as a protest against, and an alternative to, the perceived middle- class bias and assumptions of the regular churches. Its aims were to help the schools in their teaching of Socialism. The schools were grouped in District Unions and for the first ten years were affiliated to the Council. However, in 1920 the constitution was amended to allow direct school affiliation which meant there was wide representation at the Annual Conference. The manual was prepared chiefly for the use of teachers. It contains specimen lessons and technique help to the teachers together with suggested reading for socialist education. It was the leadership's view that public education should be secular and Socialist Sunday Schools were for purely educational bodies and therefore the hymns did not have theological tendencies or the Christian dogma which was preached in religious churches of the day. They worked in close harmony with the Labour Movement and were concerned with the spiritual and social objective of the human race with regard to daily life and conduct. The Socialist Sunday Schools along with the Labour Church were impeded by a lack of their own premises and met objections to hiring of suitable halls to the extent that in 1907 London County Council evicted five branches out of hired school buildings. A massive demonstration in Trafalgar Square ensued addressed by Margaret McMillan who, with her sister, was a Christian socialist and campaigned for better education and health for poor children. A few years later the Springburn branch met for many years in the Labour Party's Unity Hall in Ayr Street for the same reason. Later in 1926 Fulham Council refused permission on Sundays because it was of a 'non-theological' character. It was becoming apparent that the reason that the Socialist Sunday Schools were encountering so much opposition was because they were 'being seen as subversive and as poisoning the minds of the young people of the country with their political and anti-religious doctrines and teachings' and there were those who tried to discredit the Schools by accusations of blasphemy and revolutionary teachings. =Publications= right The Young Socialist was a monthly periodical published by the National Council and was first issued in Glasgow in 1901 and in the September 1910 edition the editor wrote that the true socialist, whatever, if any, denomination he belonged to, wanted fellowship, a kingdom of love and happiness, not hell. The Socialist Sunday Schools were organised with this theory as a basis and although there was no formulated set of rules to be followed there were three main guidelines of ethics, morality, brotherly love and social obligation. * That morality is the fulfillment of one's duty to one's neighbour. * That the present social system is devoid of the elements of love or justice, since, as an organisation, it ignores the claims of the weak and distressed, and that is, therefore, immoral; * That society can be reorganised on a basis of love and justice, and that it is every man's duty to use all available social forces in bringing about that reorganisation.' There were also 'ten commandments' to be followed which were printed in some of the editions of the hymn book. # Love your schoolfellows, who will be your fellow workmen in life. # Love learning, which is the food of the mind; be as grateful to your teacher as to your parents. # Make every day holy by good and useful deeds and kindly actions. # Honour good men, be courteous to all men, bow down to none. # Do not hate or speak evil of anyone. Do not be revengeful but stand up for your right and resist oppression. # Do not be cowardly. Be a friend to the weak and love justice. # Remember that all good things of the earth are produced by labour. Whoever enjoys them without working for them is stealing the bread of the workers. # Observe and think in order to discover the truth. Do not believe what is contrary to reason and never deceive yourself or others. # Do not think that he who loves his own country must hate and despise other nations, or wish for war, which is a remnant of barbarism. # Look forward to the day when all men and women will be free citizens of one fatherland and live together as brothers and sisters in peace and righteousness. Socialist Sunday Schools in the United StatesOrigins= The earliest known Socialist Sunday Schools (SSS) in the United States of America was launched on March 1, 1880 in New York City by Branch 14 of the Socialist Labor Party of America.Christiane Harzig, \\"The Role of German Women in the German-American Working-Class Movement in Late Nineteenth-Century New York,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History, vol. 8, no. 2 (Spring 1989), pg. 93. Some 30 students participated at the time of the school's launch, which was lauded in the daily New Yorker Volkszeitung as an institution of great benefit to the entire German working- class neighborhood located on Manhattan's East Side. The female members of Branch 14 were instrumental in the financial support of the school, which over the next two years conducted a series of concerts, performances, and fundraising social events. Other early American Socialist Sunday Schools were launched in the city of Chicago during the last years of the 1880s.Kenneth Teitelbaum, Schooling for \\"Good Rebels\\": Socialist Education for Children in the United States, 1900-1920. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 1993; pg. 39. Four such schools were identified by police officials at the time and declared by the authorities to be of \\"Socialistic and Anarchistic origin.\\" Classes were conducted in German — the main language of the immigrant- dominated American socialist movement of the dayAbout 80% of the members of the Socialist Labor Party of America during its initial 20 years were German- speakers. See: Christiane Harzig, \\"The Role of German Women in the German- American Working-Class Movement in Late Nineteenth-Century New York,\\" pg. 91. — and about 500 children are believed to have attended in all. With the memory of the Haymarket Affair still fresh, these Sunday Schools were characterized by police official Michael J. Schaack as \\"the most conspicuous feature of the propaganda of the Internationale in Chicago today\\" and condemned for their \\"sowing in the minds of innocent children the seeds of atheism, discontent, and lawlessness.\\"Michael J. Schaack, Anarchy and Anarchists: A History of the Red Terror and the Social Revolution in America and Europe. Chicago: F.J. Schulte, 1889; pp. 668-674. Quoted in Teitelbaum, Schooling for \\"Good Rebels,\\" pg. 39. One Chicago SSS, the North Side Sunday School, met each week for one hour of instruction by a member of the local Turn Verein, during which the ills of the capitalist system and the proposed alternative of socialism were expounded.\\"Socialist Sunday-School Picnic: A School Where Contempt of the Present Social System is Taught,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, vol. 48 (July 30, 1888), pg. 1. An 1888 front page story in the Chicago Tribune plaintively editorialized that under the slogan \\"no religion and no church\\" children were being subjected to \\"an inculcation of socialistic views at an age particularly impressionable.\\" An annual summer picnic and outing was held by the school in conjunction with the Turn Verein, attended by several hundred children ranging in age from 3 to 16. Socialist Sunday Schools also seem to have existed in a few other major metropolitan areas, including a SSS started in Philadelphia in the Fall of 1888, with 6 teachers and about 150 pupils present for the launch.\\"A Socialist Sunday School: Two Hundred Pupils Attend the First Session — What They Were Taught,\\" Philadelphia Times, whole no. 4735 (Sept. 3, 1888), pg. 3. Additional Sunday Schools linked to the organized anarchist movement sprouted up in various American urban centers during the first decade of the 1900s, springing primarily from the so-called Modern School movement developed by the Catalan anarchist Francisco Ferrer in 1901. The Modern Schools were intended to be both instruments for self-development and social change and taught the values of cooperation, sympathy for the downtrodden, collective solidarity, anti-militarism, anti-capitalism, and opposition to the power of the centralized state. About 22 such schools were established. Although originally intended to be expanded and transformed into regular day schools, most of these radical \\"Modern Schools\\" proved to be short-lived. =Schools of the Socialist Party of America= Williamsbridge, Bronx, New York was organized in 1911 by Italian immigrants to provide an alternative to the Sunday Schools of the Roman Catholic Church.\\"The Williamsbridge Socialist Sunday School of New York,\\" The Young Socialists' Magazine, vol. 4, no. 7 (July 1911), pg. 11. The primary Socialist Sunday School movement in the United States was that connected with the country's largest socialist organization, the Socialist Party of America (SPA). Approximately 100 Socialist Sunday Schools (SSS) were established by the SPA during the first two decades of the 20th Century.Teitelbaum, Schooling for \\"Good Rebels,\\" pg. 37. These institutions were intended to supplement the general education obtained by working class children in the publicly owned school system of the country. Socialist Sunday Schools of the SPA were organized in no fewer than 64 cities and towns spread across 20 states and the District of Columbia. While schools associated with the Socialist Party were established in such Midwestern cities as Chicago and Omaha, Nebraska, the center of greatest activity was New York City and the neighboring cities of Southern New Jersey.Patti McGill Peterson, The Young Socialist Movement in America from 1905 to 1940: A Study of the Young People's Socialist League. PhD dissertation. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin, 1974; pg. 24. According to one scholar the impetus for these schools came from the Workmen's Circle (Arbeiter Ring), a Yiddish-language Socialist fraternal benefit society. The publishers of the Socialist New Yorker Volkszeitung were quick to follow, launching a periodical to aid the effort in December 1908 called The Little Socialist Magazine for Boys and Girls.Peterson, The Young Socialist Movement in America from 1905 to 1940, pg. 26. The name of the publication was changed to the less infantile Young Socialists' Magazine in June 1911. By 1911 some 14 Socialist Sunday Schools were in existence in the New York metropolitan area. The first Socialist Sunday School on the Pacific coast of the United States was established in Oakland, California early in 1906.\\"Socialists' Sunday- School,\\" San Francisco Call, vol. 99, no. 60 (Jan. 29, 1906), pg. 6. Coordinated by Socialist Party of California activist H.H. Lilienthal, more than 100 children were enrolled at the organization's January 28 launch, which was held at the headquarters facility of Local Oakland. While precise enrollment numbers are not available, one contemporary estimated in the spring of 1911 that some 2,000 children participated in English-language Socialist Sunday Schools, supplanted by others in schools for children who spoke German, Latvian, Yiddish, and other languages of the immigrant community.Peterson, The Young Socialist Movement in America from 1905 to 1940, pg. 25. Among the leaders of the Socialist Party's effort to develop Socialist Sunday Schools was Bertha Mailly, for a time Secretary of the New York State Committee, who encouraged prospective SSS teachers to read John Dewey's School and Society to provide a conceptual basis for their work.Teitelbaum, Schooling for \\"Good Rebels,\\" pg. 38. During the second decade of the 20th Century the Socialist Party's \\"Young People's Department,\\" headed by William Kruse, published an organizing manual for party locals seeking to establish Socialist Sunday Schools, including an extensive proposed list of books for SSS libraries. The Socialist education movement in America was closely connected with certain of the foreign language federations of the SPA, which taught children in their native tongue.Teitelbaum, Schooling for \\"Good Rebels,\\" pg. 42. Known to have organized Socialist Sunday Schools during this period were the Finnish Socialist Federation, the Ukrainian Socialist Federation, the Hungarian Socialist Federation, and the Lettish Socialist Federation. In tandem with the Socialist Party of America's network of Sunday Schools there existed a system of radical Sunday Schools conducted by the Workmen's Circle (Arbeiter Ring), a predominantly Yiddish language socialist mutual benefit organization. Founded in 1892, the Workmen's Circle was reorganized in 1901 and had grown to a membership of 6,700 by 1905.Teitelbaum, Schooling for \\"Good Rebels,\\" pg. 43. By 1924 the Workmen's Circle was considerably larger than the declining Socialist Party, counting a membership of 85,000 in nearly 700 branches spread across 38 states and Canada. The Workmen's Circle established an educational bureau of its own in 1908 and sponsored programs for both adults and children, including some specifically designated as \\"Socialist Sunday Schools.\\" Some of these Workmen's Circle schools eventually allied themselves with the closely related network of Socialist Party schools, while others retained an independent affiliation with the Jewish socialist organization which had pioneered them. =Publications= The primary publication of the Socialist Party's youth movement was a monthly magazine called Young Socialist's Magazine, established in 1908.Teitelbaum, Schooling for \\"Good Rebels,\\" pg. 41. Although it would be incorrect to say that the activities of the British Socialist Sunday Schools were the sole influence upon the American movement, British publications and experiences were closely followed by American SSS activists. American SSS workers traveled to Britain to observe the activities of the thriving school movement there, and reported their findings upon their return. Socialist Schools in other countries According to Kenneth Teitelbaum, a scholar of the Socialist youth education movement, Socialist schools for children also existed in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Hungary, Belgium, and Switzerland.

Personal  Norman Chandler was born in Los Angeles on September 14, 1899, one of eight children of Harry Chandler and Marian Otis Chandler. His grandfather, Harrison Gray Otis, had been publisher of, the Los Angeles Times from 1881 to 1917, and his father from 1917 to 1944. As a youth he was raised in his parents' estate on Hillhurst near the Greek Theater. He delivered copies of the Los Angeles Times in a model‐T Ford. Chandler attended Hollywood High School, then Stanford University, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Sigma Rho chapter). While at Stanford, he met an athletic coed from Long Beach, who he married, Dorothy Buffum. They raised their two children, Mia and Otis Chandler on their suburban ranch in Sierra Madre. After the children grew up, they moved to a grand Italianate house on Lorraine Ave in the Windsor Square neighborhood of Los Angeles. Through his later years, the silver‐haired, pipe- smoking, handsome Chandler was a frequent visitor to the California Club, the Bohemian Grove, and his beach house in the Dana Strand Club in Dana Point, CA.Halberstam, David (2012-12-18). The Powers That Be. Open Road Media. . The Los Angeles Times This Week magazine; and Julius Ochs Adler, The New York Times. After dropping out of Stanford his senior year, Chandler started working at the Los Angeles Times on a seven year training program under his father, Harry Chandler, who had been its publisher since 1917. Norman Chandler became general manager in 1936, president in 1941 and at his father’s death in 1944, the third publisher of the newspaper. The Times prospered under Chandler, and gained regional, as well as national, prominence. In 1947 it became the largest-circulation newspaper in Los Angeles, and in 1961 the Sunday paper had a circulation of more than one million. Seeking to create a community-like work environment, Chandler was one of the first newspaper employers to offer benefits to his employees, including health insurance and pension plans, and to foster community spirit. His wife, too, recognized the importance of community spirit, instigating great revitalization of the culture of Los Angeles. Always one to recognize his success as coming from the success of his employees, Chandler constantly sought to create a warm, caring environment in which the individual needs of the workers and their families were always a consideration. In this way, Chandler was able to bring out the best in his employees so that the paper as a whole benefited, together with the larger community of Los Angeles, and beyond into the wider society. Time Magazine honored Chandler in 1957 by putting him on the cover. “In the world today,” he said, “we are witnessing education and publishing rivaling the population explosion in dramatic growth. The necessities of life have always challenged man's ingenuity—now the distribution of knowledge has become the challenge of the age.” Chandler retired as publisher in 1960, leaving the job to his thirty year old son Otis Chandler.  Times Mirror Corporation  The parent company of the Los Angeles Times, started by Harrison Gray Otis, was the Times Mirror Company. Under Norman Chandler's leadership, Times Mirror grew with both acquisitions and internal growth, becoming the first family- owned newspaper company to go public. After letting his son, Otis, take over as publisher of the Times, Norman Chandler remained as chairman of the board from 1961-1968. Over the objections of his conservative family, he succeeded in getting the corporation listed on the NYSE in 1964. He then used the public shares to continue his expansion and diversification of the company, acquiring New American Library book publishers in 1960; the book publisher World Publishing Company in 1962: C.V. Mosby Company (1967), which published medical college textbooks and reference books; Harry N. Abrams — a publisher of art and photography books (1966); legal publisher Matthew Bender; and air navigation publisher Jeppesen (1961). The company also acquired more newspapers: Newsday, The Dallas Times Herald and The Orange Coast Pilot in Costa Mesa, Calif. Chandler also brought Times-Mirror Company into broadcasting; Times Mirror was a founding owner of television station KTTV in Los Angeles, which opened in January 1949. It became that station's sole owner in 1951, after re-acquiring the minority shares it had sold to CBS in 1948. Times-Mirror also purchased a former motion picture studio, Nassour Studios, in Hollywood in 1950, which was then used to consolidate KTTV's operations. Later to be known as Metromedia Square (then the Fox Television Center), the studio was sold along with KTTV to Metromedia in 1963. Civic benefactor He funded the construction of the Hollywood Palladium at a cost of $1.6 million in 1940. His wife, Dorothy Buffum Chandler, led Los Angeles' cultural revitalization in the 50s and 60s, first with the restoration of the Hollywood Bowl, then with the construction of the Los Angeles Music Center (the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre).

He also ventured into the field of mathematics and served on the committee that developed the French Republican Calendar. Along with Constantin François Chassebœuf de Volney (1757–1820) Dupuis was known for developing the Christ myth theory, which argued that Christianity was an amalgamation of various ancient mythologies and that Jesus was a mythical character. Biography Dupuis was born in Trie-Château (in present-day Oise), the son of a schoolmaster. His precocious talents were recognized by the duc de La Rochefoucauld who sent him to the College d'Harcourt. Dupuis made such rapid progress that, at the age of twenty-four, he was appointed professor of rhetoric at the college of Lisieux, where he had previously passed as a Licentiate of Theology. In his hours of leisure he studied law, and in 1770 he abandoned the clerical career and became an advocate. Two university discourses which he delivered in Latin were printed, and laid the foundation of his literary fame. In 1778, he invented a telegraph with which he was able to correspond with his friend Fortin de Bagneux, and must be considered among the first inventors of the telegraph that was perfected by Claude Chappe. The Revolution made it necessary to destroy his machine in order to avoid suspicion. Dupuis devoted himself to the study of astronomy (his tutor was Lalande) in connection with mythology, the result of which was his magnum opus: Origine de tous les Cultes, ou la Réligion Universelle. It appeared in 1795 in quarto or octavo format, profusely illustrated (in 12 volumes); an abridgement (1798) spread his system more widely among the reading public. In Origine he advocated the unity of the astronomical and religious myths of all nations, an aspect of the Enlightenment's confidence in the universality of human nature. In his Mémoire explicatif du Zodiaque, chronologique et mythologique (1806) he similarly maintains a common origin for the astronomical and religious opinions of the Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese, Persians, and Arabians. His basis was what he saw as the perfect correspondence between the signs of the zodiac and their significations had existed in Upper Egypt at a period of between fifteen and sixteen thousand years before the present time, and that it had existed only there. Subsequently, this harmony had been disturbed by the effect of the precession of the equinoxes. He therefore ascribed the invention of the signs of the zodiac to the people who then inhabited Upper Egypt or Ethiopia. His theory as to the origin of mythology in Upper Egypt led to the expedition organized by Napoleon for the exploration of that country. He then contributed to the Journal des savants a memoire on the origin of the constellations and on the explication of myth through astronomy, which was published as a separate fascicle in 1781. He came to the attention of Frederick the Great, who appointed him secretary but died before Dupuis could take up duties in Berlin. The chair of humanity in the Collège de France having at the same time become vacant, it was conferred on Dupuis, where he taught Latin eloquence, and in 1788 he became a member of the Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres. He now resigned his professorship at Lisieux, and was appointed by the administrators of the department of Paris one of the four commissioners of public instruction. After the start of the French Revolution, Dupuis fled Paris for Évreux, appalled by the massacres of September 1792, only to return when he discovered he had been elected to the National Convention, where he sat on the Council of Five Hundred, and was President of the Legislative Body after the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire. He left political life in 1802. In April 1806 he received the Legion of Honor. Dupuis believed in an impersonal God that permeated everything. Charles Bradlaugh has classified Dupuis as a pantheist.Bradlaugh, Charles. (1895). Theological Essays. London. p. 59 Christ myth theory The beginnings of the formal denial of the existence of Jesus can be traced to late 18th century France, and the works of Constantin François Chassebœuf de Volney (1757–1820) and Dupuis.Weaver, Walter P.

Volney and Dupuis argued that Christianity was an amalgamation of various ancient mythologies and that Jesus was a mythical character.Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Eerdmans Publishing. pp. 7-11. . In his book, The Origin of All Religious Worship(1872) he find this intriguing reference to Zoroaster and Eiren. Erin/Eireann is Ireland's ancient name. The God of Light and of the good principle, informs Zoroaster, that he had given to man a place of delight and abundance.. this place was called Eiren, which at the beginning was more beautiful than all the world... Nothing could equal the beauty of this delightful place. Dupuis argued that ancient rituals in Syria, Egypt and Persia had influenced the Christian story which was allegorized as the histories of solar deities, such as Sol Invictus.Wells, G. A. (1969). Stages of New Testament Criticism. Journal of the History of Ideas, 30 (2): 147-160. He argued also that Jewish and Christian scriptures could be interpreted according to the solar pattern, e.g. the Fall of Man in Genesis being an allegory of the hardship caused by winter, and the resurrection of Jesus an allegory for the growth of the sun's strength in the sign of Aries at the spring equinox. Volney argued that Abraham and Sarah were derived from Brahma and his wife Saraswati, and that Christ was related to Krishna.Leask, Nigel (2004). British Romantic Writers and the East. Cambridge Univ Press. pp. 104 -105. . Volney published before Dupuis but made use of a draft version of Dupuis' work, and followed much of his argument, but at times differed from him, e.g. in arguing that the gospel stories were not intentionally created as an extended allegory grounded in solar myths, but were compiled organically when simple allegorical statements were misunderstood as history. Reception French Catholic librarian Jean-Baptiste Pérès wrote a satirical refutation of Dupuis's work under the title of Grand Erratum (1827), in which he maintains, in parallel to Dupuis's thesis that the cult of Christ is merely a cult of the Sun, that Napoleon (who, in reality, died a mere six years before the publication of the pamphlet) never existed, but was only a sun myth.

They are three seductive female vampire \\"sisters\\" who reside with Count Dracula in his castle in Transylvania, where they entrance men with their beauty and charm, and then proceed to feed upon them. Dracula provides them with victims to devour, mainly implied to be infants. Like Dracula, they are the living dead, repulsed by sunlight, garlic and religious objects. In chapter three of the novel, two are described as having dark hair and eyes, and the other as being fair, with blonde hair and blue eyes. Novel Sometime near the beginning of the novel, after Jonathan Harker arrives in Dracula's castle, he warns Harker that if he leaves his room to never sleep in any room in the castle other than his own bedroom, but does not tell him why, clearly aware that the sisters will kill him. Late one night Jonathan explores the castle and ventures to see which rooms are open to him. He finds many of the doors in the castle are locked but one room in particular he forced open, noticing that the door wasn't locked but the hinges were fallen. He enters into the furthest right wing of the castle with views from the windows overlooking the countryside and rooms with comfortable furniture. He sits at a table writing in his journal and as he felt sleepy, he remembered Dracula's warning but felt satisfied disobeying it and lays in a great couch in the corner of the room. As he believes he is sleeping he sees three women standing in the moonlight which was shining throughout the room but not casting any shadows upon the floor. More than delighted that fresh prey has entered their domain, they proceed to seduce him. Harker feels a burning desire for their lips to kiss his. As one of them begins to kiss his neck, he feels her sharp teeth barely scrape against his flesh. At that precise moment Dracula is seen grabbing her neck and hurling her away from him. Driving them back and chastising them for trying to feed on Harker when he wasn't done with him, he promises to give Harker to them after his business deal is concluded and gives them a \\"wiggling bag\\" (highly presumed by Harker to be a human child) to appease them. Harker soon fears for his life after this encounter, at one point thinking he sees them dancing in the sky outside his bedroom when he nearly nods off, which strengthens his resolve to escape. Dracula makes good on his word and leaves Harker to the sisters when he heads for England. Though Harker manages to escape the castle shortly after, he is badly traumatized by the encounter and is diagnosed with brain fever. Though they lose their victim, the brides continue to haunt the castle and terrorize the nearby village. The sisters are seen again near the end of the novel as the protagonists pursue Count Dracula to Transylvania. The sisters suddenly appear at a camp consisting of Van Helsing and Mina Harker. Sensing that Mina is cursed with vampirism, they beckon her to join them, referring to her as their \\"sister\\" and promising not to harm her. However, Van Helsing had previously crushed a Sacred wafer and scattered it in a circle around the campsite. Due to this protective barrier both Mina and the sisters are unable to cross its border. Although the Vampires kept away from the camp they remained in the darkness until sunrise upon which they fled back to the castle. At the coming of daylight, Van Helsing finds that their horses are dead (he speculates that they had died of fright in the sisters' supernatural presence, though some adaptations have the sisters kill the horses directly, either to slow down Van Helsing or simply to feed before they flee back to the castle). After Van Helsing binds Mina in another ring of sacramental bread, he subsequently goes to Dracula's castle alone to destroy the vampires and sterilize Dracula's tomb, keeping him from ever being able to enter it again. After locating the vampires' graves, he finds them asleep 'open eyed'. He attempts to kill the first but almost fails as his eyes befall her beauty. Caught in an enchantment, he becomes entranced and lost in a state of uncertainty. Becoming overwhelmed with emotions, he feels compelled to protect her instead and even contemplates love for her. He suddenly hears a 'Soul Wail' from Mina which breaks the enchantment allowing him to finish his work. First using a blacksmith hammer, he strikes a stake into her, then proceeds to operate on her, detaching the head from the body then filling the mouth with garlic. He repeats this process with the other two as well, taking him an entire day to complete. Dracula's reaction to their deaths is not known.  Characters  In the novel the three vampire women are not individually named. Collectively, they are known as the \\"sisters\\", and are at one point described as the \\"weird sisters\\". Although the three vampire women in Dracula are generally referred to as the \\"Brides of Dracula\\" in popular culture and media, they are never referred to as such in the novel. Whether they are married to Dracula or not is never mentioned in the novel, nor are they described as having any other relation to him. The origin and identity of the Sisters, as well as the true nature of their relationship with Count Dracula, is never revealed. One of the three may have been identified in the short story \\"Dracula's Guest\\", as the vampire named Countess Dolengen of Gratz. Jonathan Harker, the protagonist of the story, encounters her at her tomb in Munich. Just as she is about to bite him, Dracula intervenes and destroys her. Then, in the form of a great wolf, he keeps Harker warm from the cold and yelps for nearby soldiers to come to their location. In the novel, Harker writes about one of the female vampires in the moment he is with them, stating, \\"I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where.\\" Stoker, pgs. 54–55}} The two dark-haired vampire women are described as facially resembling the Count, in that the three have aquiline noses. It has been suggested from this that it may have been Stoker's intent that these two are Dracula's daughters, extending the sexuality metaphor of vampirism to incest. When the brides first discover Harker, the blonde vampire is encouraged to feed on him first, with one of the others stating, \\"Yours is the right to begin,\\" signifying that she has some status over the others. This could imply that the blonde vampire is Dracula's wife or consort, and the mother of the two dark-haired women, if they are indeed his daughters. When Van Helsing discovers the sisters' tombs, the blonde's is far more opulent than the others', as if for a loved one or one of high status. Harker describes the women as \\"ladies by their dress and manner\\", indicating that the vampires are of high lineage, further suggesting the idea that they are Dracula's family. The blonde vampire is shown to act in a mildly rebellious manner toward Dracula, when he scolds her for attempting to feed on Harker; Dracula's reaction upon discovering the sisters with Harker is both that of a jealous husband and an angry father. The vampire women claim that Dracula does not love them, nor has he ever loved them, but Dracula insists he does love them, and shows he cares for them by providing them with victims to feed upon. However, it is not explained why he left them behind in Transylvania rather than taking them to London with him. Even though it is never specified, it is possible that the term \\"sister\\" wasn't meant in the literal sense and is, instead, more comparable to the relationship of the women and not as they are to Dracula. They are also depicted in the novel calling Mina Harker their sister after she is forced to drink Dracula's blood, afflicting her with vampirism. Mina and her best friend (and Dracula's future victim) Lucy Westenra also call each other sisters in the novel despite not having any blood relation. The vampire women may be his wives throughout his lifetime, descendants of his whom he turned into vampires, or simply nonspecific women he killed and turned into vampires to create more of his kind. As vampires, the sisters are powerful in their own right; their beauty and seductive charm belie lethal, predatory interiors. Their beauty and flirtatious manner appears to be their greatest power when it comes to bewitching their victims into a trance-like state. Harker and Van Helsing are both attracted to, and yet repulsed by them. They can seemingly appear out of nowhere and are inhumanly strong, as shown when they kill Van Helsing's horses. They also have the power of flight, as seen when they fly in the air with their dresses trailing behind them. The vampires serve as foreshadowing for the threat of vampirism in the story which, as seen with Lucy later on, includes Dracula's power of corruption over his victims once he has drained their blood and made them into vampires. Screen adaptations Commonly all three brides appear in film adaptations of the novel, though some film adaptations depict them as a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead. They are typically depicted as enchantingly beautiful young women, coquettish and seductive in manner, often appearing like succubi in the night, dressed in flowing silk nightgowns, and behaving in a wild and sexually aggressive manner. * The three brides made silent appearances in the 1931 film Dracula and the Spanish language version of Drácula. (The latter film, shot simultaneously on the same sets at night with a separate cast and crew, depicts the brides as more obviously sexual than in the more chaste English-language version.) In the English-language film, they are played by Geraldine Dvorak, Cornelia Thaw, and Dorothy Tree. *In both Drakula İstanbul'da (1953) and Horror of Dracula (1958) only a single bride appears. In the latter film, the bride is played by Valerie Gaunt, who tricks and attacks Jonathan Harker and later is staked by him. *The three brides make silent appearances in the 1968 television adaptation Dracula. Although they have no dialogue, the Brides are considerably feral in their behavior, snarling, screeching, and clawing at their victim. They are also depicted as being somewhat disheveled instead of beautiful, with ragged clothing and filthy, matted hair. Notably, one of the brides is a black woman (played by Nina Baden-Semper) which appears to be unique amongst Dracula adaptions. * The three brides appear and have lines in the 1970 film Count Dracula. * The three brides appear and have lines in the Czechoslovakian TV film Hrabe Drakula (1971). The brides in this version wear elaborate gowns befitting their status as noblewomen and have personal titles: Madame, Marquise, and Countess, respectively. They are portrayed by Olga Jirouskova, Marie Joanovicova, and Vera Kresadlova. *The three brides are present but silent in the 1973 television adaptation Bram Stoker's Dracula (starring Jack Palance). They are played by Sarah Douglas, Virginia Wetherell, and Barbara Lindley. In this version, they kill Jonathan Harker and turn him into a vampire. * All three appear and have lines in the 1977 BBC production entitled Count Dracula. They are played by Susie Hickford, Sue Vanner, and Belinda Meuldijk. * In Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film Bram Stoker's Dracula, the brides were played by Monica Bellucci, Michaela Bercu, and Florina Kendrick. Bellucci, Bercu, and Kendrick's dialogue was in Romanian, and Kendrick reportedly helped her co- stars to speak her native tongue correctly. In this adaptation the vampire portrayed by Kendrick is clearly modelled on Medusa the Gorgon, and has living snakes coiled through her hair; another (played by Bellucci) appears to be based upon an Arabian princess due to her attire. It is the brunette vampire (portrayed by Kendrick) that is the leader, rather than the blonde (portrayed by Bercu). All three brides have speaking lines - the one played by Bellucci is the bride who calls Jonathan into their chamber (in English), the bride played by Bercu is the one who tells Dracula he has never loved, and the bride played by Kendrick taunts Van Helsing. * In the 1995 spoof Dracula: Dead and Loving It, only two brides appear. They are depicted as heavily sexualized when they first arrive in the room where Renfield is staying as they attempt to seduce him. Dracula saves him from the brides and sends them away before convincing the simple-minded Renfield he had simply had a strange dream. The brides are neither named nor have any spoken dialogue in this film. * Three brides appear in the 2002 Italian TV mini-series Dracula (known as Dracula's Curse in foreign markets). As in the 1992 version, they speak in their native tongue and play up their supernatural nature by being able to fly and phase through objects. * While the Brides usually remain nameless, they are called Verona, Aleera and Marishka in the 2004 film Van Helsing, respectively portrayed by Silvia Colloca, Elena Anaya, and Josie Maran. Verona is the oldest of the brides and Dracula's consort, whereas Aleera and Marishka are his concubines. Aleera, the youngest of the trio, is portrayed as the most vicious. Their roles are greatly expanded into those of secondary antagonists, motivated by a need to find a way for their offspring to live, as vampire children are born dead. They are also given the ability to transform into harpy-like creatures and fly. * At the beginning of the 2012 film Dracula 3D, Dracula attacks a young woman named Tania (portrayed by Miriam Giovanelli) after she secretly meets a lover, making her a vampire and his minion. He later passes her off as his niece to Harker, whom she tries to seduce. Tania is eventually dispatched by Van Helsing. * In 2020 Dracula TV series, Lujza Richter plays one of the vampire brides, named Elena. In this version Dracula keeps all his brides locked up in big boxes, conducting experiments on them and not permitting them to move freely around the castle. He also seems to refer to anyone that he turns into a full vampire as a \\"bride\\" (as he also uses the term to refer to Jonathan Harker, who is killed and turned into undead in this version). TV series In 2015, NBC began to develop a TV series about the Brides of Dracula characters titled Brides, written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and produced by Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter. The series was built on the premise \\"What if Van Helsing did NOT kill the three brides of Dracula? What if they survived for centuries and are now living in New York City?\\", with the series being described as a sexy re-imagining of Dracula as a family drama with a trio of strong, diverse female leads, a show about empowered women and their attempts to maintain wealth, prestige, legacy, and their non-traditional family. In October 2019, the series was still being developed with the intention to sell it to a streaming service. On January 8, 2020, it was announced that ABC network handed out a pilot order to the series. Aguirre-Sacasa will pen the script and exec produce alongside Berlanti and Schechter. Maggie Kiley will direct the pilot. The Brides will be a co- production between ABC Studios and Warner Bros. Television. In March 2020, Deadline reported the cast: Gina Torres as Cleo Phillips, the leader of this vampire trio and now a maven of New York City real estate; Katherine Reis as Lily Stevens, the youngest sister and now a striving singer; Chris Mason as Roland Grant, a stylish real estate mogul who arrives in town to challenge Cleo for professional supremacy and who has secret ties to Dracula; Sophia Tatum as Justine Strang, completely friendless and new to town as an aspiring model; Goran Višnjić as Dracula, the powerful, ageless, and iconic King of Night who “turned” each of his three brides and was left for dead at his destroyed castle in the Carpathian mountains; Erin Richards as Renée Pélagie, the sister who is now the head of a top modeling agency in New York City, known for her torrid affairs with her beautiful female models; and Charlie McElveen as Arthur Seward, an ambitious young news reporter working the graveyard shift at his paper covering news of the bizarre, and the love interest to Lily. On June 29, 2020, ABC decided to drop the series from the 2020-2021 lineup in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, but the series is being pitched to other networks. On stage *They appear in Dracula, the Musical by Frank Wildhorn and have their own song \\"Forever Young\\". *In the Czech musical Dracula, the brides are called \\"nymphs\\". They are the victims of Dracula, slightly resentful but still devoted to him. They are jealous and mischievous, and enjoy troubles and gossiping. They serve as a comical relief, but at the same time they represent Dracula's dark, vampiric side. *They also appear in the French Canadian musical Dracula - Entre l'amour et la mort. *They appear in the Northern Ballet's Dracula by David Nixon and are portrayed by Rachael Gillespie, Minju Kang, and Sarah Chun in 2019 production of the ballet, which was recorded and showed in UK cinemas on Halloween and then broadcast on BBC4 in 2020. Characters based on the original Brides *In the 1960 Hammer film The Brides of Dracula, the Baron Meinster (David Peel) is a vampire who attacks an unnamed local village girl (played by Marie Devereux) and the heroine Marianne's friend Gina (Andrée Melly), turning them into vampires and his \\"brides\\". Although he actually proposes to Marianne (Yvonne Monlaur), his plan to turn her is thwarted by Professor Van Helsing (Peter Cushing), who kills the Baron while the two vampire brides seemingly escape. Despite the film's title, Dracula never appears in it. * In Count Yorga, Vampire (1970), which is a modern-day re-telling of Dracula, Yorga likewise has his own set of Brides, first starting out with two: a red-haired Bride and a blonde (who is later revealed to be Donna's deceased mother), then later adding the protagonist's brunette friend, Erica to the ranks. The sequel, The Return of Count Yorga increases the number of Brides to a least a dozen, with the protagonist's sister, Ellen and a friend, Mitzi, joining them. *The Brides of Dracula concept was also present in the 1987 horror comedy The Monster Squad, in which Dracula abducts three young women and turns them into his vampire brides. *In Dracula 2000, the brides are turned at different times throughout the movie. Jennifer Esposito, Jeri Ryan and Colleen Ann Fitzpatrick portray the brides, Solina, Valerie and Lucy respectively. * The brides also appear in the television series Buffy The Vampire Slayer in the season 5 premier \\"Buffy vs. Dracula\\"(2001). They are referred to as \\"The Three Sisters\\" and are credited as \\"Vampire Girls\\". They are portrayed by Marita Schaub, Lesli Jean Matta, and Jennifer Slimko. *In Hotel Transylvania (2012), Dracula's wife Martha (voiced by Jackie Sandler) is an homage to the Brides of Dracula. In literature *In The Dracula Tape (1975) they are seen not long after Harker comes into the castle with Dracula warning them to leave him be. In this story, the brides are disrespectful to Dracula and try to undermine him where they can. Dracula later reveals that he has tired of them and does not even remember why he turned them in the first place. It is implied that unlike Dracula (who did not want to scare or harm anyone), the women let the power go to their heads once they became vampires and he had more or less planned to abandon them in the castle. But while Dracula was trying to make friends with Harker, their visit as depicted in the novel only make the situation and misunderstanding worse. In this adaptation they are named Melisse, the tall, dark-haired bride. Wanda, the second dark-haired one and described as full-breasted as well as mentioned to be Melisse's younger sister. And Anna, the blonde bride who is noted to be the senior of the three and the one who is most outspoken and rebellious against Dracula. Later in the story when Dracula returns back to the castle, he finds that the three have terrorized the village Dracula was friends with and promptly confronts them. Anna attempts an assassination by controlling a partially turned farmhand to attack him, but Dracula easily thwarts the attempt, reprimands them and sends them away. When they're killed by Van Helsing, Dracula does mention that, while he was glad that their deaths prevented jealously with Mina, that he didn't wish that fate on them as well. * In the alternate history novel Anno Dracula (1992), Dracula becomes dominant in Britain and eventually weds Queen Victoria, becoming Prince consort and Lord Protector. Despite being married to Victoria he keeps his retinue of Brides. It is mentioned that one of the Brides is Barbara of Celje. In the first sequel, The Bloody Red Baron, the Brides of Dracula are mentioned as including Mata Hari, Lady Marikova (from the novel The House of Dracula by Ronald Chetwynd-Hayes), Lola-Lola (from the film The Blue Angel), Sadie Thompson, Lemora and Baron Meinster (from the film The Brides of Dracula). In the beginning of the second sequel, Dracula Cha Cha Cha, a list of Dracula's official Brides is given. They are: Elisabeta of Transylvania (from Bram Stoker's Dracula), 1448–1462; Ilona Szilagy (Vlad III's real-life second wife), 1466–1476; Marguerite Chopin of Courtempierre (from Vampyr), 1709–1711; Queen Victoria, 1886–1888; and Sari Gábor, 1948–1949. The plot surrounds Dracula's engagement to Princess Asa Vajda (from Black Sunday). *Chelsea Quinn Yarbro has written a trilogy called Sisters of the Night, with each book featuring the story of one of the Brides: The Angry Angel (1998) featuring Kelene, The Soul of an Angel (1999) featuring Fenice Zucchar and The Angel of Death (unpublished) featuring Zhameni. *In The Diaries of the Family Dracul by Jeanne Kalogridis, the Brides are imagined as Zsuzsanna Tsepesh, a descendant of Vlad Dracul (believed in the novels to be his niece); Dunya, a Transylvanian servant of Vlad's mortal descendants, and Elisabeth Bathory, the notorious Hungarian noblewoman who murdered hundreds of her servants and bathed in their blood. *In Fangland (2007), author John Marks re-imagines the Brides of Dracula as Greek brothers. *In Dracula's Diary by Michael Geare and Michael Corby, the Brides are named Trandafira, Vlastimila and Pavola. *In The Satanic Brides of Dracula by Lucas Thorn, the Brides are named Vasilja, Senka and Hailwic. *In the Daughters of Shadow and Blood trilogy by J.

Curiously despite the Brides being centuries older, Dracula gave Lucy command over them, likely because of her resistance to religious symbols due to being turned in a modern era. *In the mini-series Grimm Fairy Tales present Helsing, three of the Brides track down the protagonist and try to kill her. She kills two of them before the third retreats. Near the end of the story, when the heroes track Dracula to his mansion during a party, we see he has amassed a large group of women as his Brides though orders them to let the protagonist pass so she may confront him.

He starts with three: Vanessa, a classmate of the boy he was possessing and initially has a crush on who rejected him, the mother of the protagonist who studied wiccan magic when she was human whom he kills to stop her from stopping him, and a hooker brought to him by the Renfields to feed on. Dracula had especially hoped to use the mother's powers against her daughter. After he loses her, he creates six more Brides in preparation for the final battle, one of whom was a reporter seen in an earlier volume covering the mysterious murders, whom Dracula turns when she does a report outside his manor. *In the Alucard novel by Matthew Scott, Dracula has three vampire brides: Illyana, Camilla and Silvia. Each is described respectively as blonde, raven-haired and a redhead and are highly sexual vampires and enjoy inflicting chaos and bloodshed whenever the opportunity presents itself. There is also a fourth bride mentioned in the novel, Jana, but who is ultimately killed by her and Dracula's son Alucard shortly after her resurrection as a vampire. *In the novel The Third Bride by Todd Davis, the Dracula story is told from the perspective of the youngest bride, Serephine de Bachaumont, a minor French noble who flees France during the Revolution.

At the , Walkaway had a population of 270. Its name is a corruption of the native \\"Wagga wah\\", referring to the bend in the nearby Greenough River, and was originally given to the railway station when a line was built from Geraldton in 1887. Rail In 1894 Midland railway line, Western Australia was linked with Midland Junction by the building of a private line-that of the Midland Railway Company, constructed by an engineer and later the first General Manager of the Company, Edward V. H. Keane. With the railway and an expanding agricultural area, the township grew until with the dieselisation of the railway systems, and the take-over by the State of the Midland Railway in 1964, decline set in. This was also accentuated by the gradual absorption of the original smallholdings into the larger holdings of today's farming demands. Renewable Energy A number of renewable energy generation projects are located near Walkaway. Current projects (2014) produce 162 Megawatts of electrical power. Additional projects along with upgrades to current projects are scheduled for construction.List of wind farms in Western Australia The Mid West region is identified as a potential location for developing renewable energy technologies that include additional wind and solar photovoltaic electricity projects, solar thermal, geothermal, bioenergy, and ocean energy. Wind turbines at the Walkaway Wind Farm =Walkaway Wind Farm= The Walkaway Wind Farm, east of Walkaway, was completed in August 2005. It consists of 54 turbines, each producing , high, and with blade spans. Development consent has been given for an expansion of the project to up to 400MW. =Mumbida Wind Farm= The Mumbida Wind Farm, east of Walkaway, is a 55 MW renewable energy project developed by a joint venture of Verve Energy and Infrastructure Capital Group (ICG). Mumbida was completed in 2013 and is now fully operational. Mumbida Wind Farm utilises the 2.5 MW General Electric 2.5xl wind turbines, the first time that this model of wind turbine has been used in Australia. The Mumbida wind farm has been designed to be expanded to 85MW in the future. =Greenough River Solar Farm= The Greenough River Solar Farm is the first stage of a 40MW solar photo voltaic (PV) electricity generator. Stage 1 currently produces 10MW and was commissioned in 2012. At the time of commissioning, it was the largest solar PV generator in Australia. Construction of Stage 2 is scheduled to begin in 2014 and will add an additional 30MW to the project, located east of Walkaway and southeast of Geraldton, on the Walkaway-Nangetty Road.

The southern part of the range lies in the restricted Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake and the northern part of the range is designated as the Coso Range Wilderness. The mountains include Coso Peak, at above sea level, as well as Silver Peak and Silver Mountain, both more than in height. The range is underlain principally by Mesozoic granitic rocks that are partly veneered by upper Cenozoic volcanic rocks of the Coso Volcanic Field. The volcanic units (in apparent decreasing age) include (1) widespread basaltic flows, (2) dacitic flows and tuff, and (3) rhyolitic domes and flows and basaltic cones and flows. These volcanic rocks are encompassed by an oval-shaped zone of late Cenozoic ring faulting that measures about east to west and north to south and that defines a structural basin. Most of the Coso Range and a slice of the adjacent Sierra Nevada lie within this ring structure. The youngest volcanic rocks are Pleistocene and, with associated active fumaroles, occupy a north- trending structural and topographic ridge about near the center of the basin. The ring structure and associated volcanic rocks suggest a large underlying magma chamber that has periodically erupted lava to the surface during the past few million years. Prehistory Numerous rock art sites (the Coso Rock Art District) are found in the range, left by the ancient Coso People. The prehistoric Coso inhabitants exported volcanic glass (Coso obsidian) and this highly valued toolstone has been found as far distant as the Channel Islands of California.Garfinkel 2007 Little Petroglyph Canyon and Renegade Canyon within the Range are open for guided tours through the Maturango Museum in Ridgecrest, California.

He followed the Gelug tradition, and was considered unconventional in his teaching style. Lama Yeshe was born near the Tibetan town of Tolung Dechen, but was sent to Sera Monastery in Lhasa at the age of six. He received full ordination at the age of 28 from Kyabje Ling Rinpoche. Jeffrey Paine reports that Lama Yeshe deliberately refused the geshe degree, despite having studied for it: Sera Monastery did award him an honorary geshe degree in the early 80s. He also used to joke that he was a Tibetan hippie: \\"I dropped out!\\" Teaching Western students With the Chinese invasion in 1959 Lama Yeshe made his way to Bhutan and thence to the Tibetan refugee camp at Buxaduar, India. There his teacher Geshe Rabten entrusted to his care a younger monk, Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. The two would work together throughout Lama Yeshe's life. In 1965 Lama Yeshe began teaching Western students, beginning with Zina Rachevsky, who sought him out at the Ghum Monastery in Darjeeling. The number of students continued to grow, eventually resulting in the founding of the several institutions mentioned above. At this time, the Tibetan religious community considered the teaching of Westerners to be undesirable. Paine reports criticism from other Tibetans calling Lama Yeshe a \\"paisa lama,\\" i.e., one interested primarily in money. In 1977 - 1978 Lama Yeshe taught at University of California Santa Cruz. There he taught one class, \\"Tibetan Buddhism\\", appropriately. During that time, he also attended courses at the University in Western Philosophy.http://www.lamayeshe.com/?sect=article&id;=854 Thubten Yeshe and his main student, Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, founded Kopan Monastery in Kathmandu, Nepal for the western seekers in the 1960s. The first annual ‘One-Month Meditation Course’ was held there in November 1971. Responding to the growing demand from their Western students, the Lamas decided to open a sister centre to be used for retreats. In 1972, along with a few of their Western students, Lamas Yeshe and Zopa bought an old colonial house on a hill above McLeod Ganj in Dharamkot in Himachal Pradesh, and Tushita Meditation Centre was founded. Lecture-based published books A number of books have been compiled from Lama Yeshe's lectures. His books include Introduction to Tantra, Wisdom Energy, The Bliss of Inner Fire, Becoming Vajrasattva: The Tantric Path of Purification, When the Chocolate Runs Out, and Becoming the Compassion Buddha, all of which are available from Wisdom Publications. In 2020 the Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive published an extensive biography of Lama Yeshe written by Adele Hulse.http://www.lamayeshe.com/biglove The LYWA also has many free books of Lama Yeshe's (and Lama Zopa Rinpoche's) teachings, which are also available as ebooks. The Archive also has several DVDs of Lama Yeshe's talks and teachings, maintains an active presence on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.), publishes a free monthly eletter. of which more than 200 back issues are available, and offers a free monthly podcast and many free videos on its YouTube channel. Personal In 1974 Lama Yeshe entered into a celibate marriage with a now-deceased Australian disciple, apparently for the purpose of obtaining an Australian passport which, it was thought, might have allowed him to visit Tibet.Paul Croucher, A History of Buddhism in Australia, 1948-1988; New South Wales UP, 1989; p. 93. His intended journey took place in 1982. Death and reincarnation Lama Yeshe died 20 minutes before dawn on the first day of Losar, the Tibetan New Year, and was cremated at the Vajrapani Institute in Boulder Creek, California,http://fpmt.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/2/2009/03/LamaYeshePasses.pdf where there is a stupa honoring him. In 1986 his reincarnation was identified in the person of a Spanish boy, Ösel Hita Torres, who is now known as Tenzin Ösel Hita (b. 1985). This makes Yeshe the first in a line of tulkus. After spending his childhood and youth in Nepal receiving a traditional education for a Gelugpa tulku, Ösel subsequently chose to attend a western secondary boarding school in Canada and is currently a filmmaker in Spain. He has expressed discomfort with others' expectations as to his role in life and is committed to spiritual discovery in a post-modern context, as are other young tulkus, in particular Ösel Hita's close friend, the 23rd Gomo Tulku.

Occupation Little is known about Sophroniscus, and his relationship with his son Socrates. According to tradition, Sophroniscus was by trade a stonemason or sculptor.p. 58, W. K. C. Guthrie, Socrates, Cambridge University Press, 1971. Plato scholars Thomas Brickhouse and Nicholas Smith question the authenticity of that tradition, mainly on the grounds that the earliest extant sources of the story are comparatively late and that it is unmentioned by more reliable sources such as Plato, Xenophon, Aristophanes, or Aristotle.p. 17, The Philosophy of Socrates, Westview Press, 2000. According to John Burnet, the earliest extant mention of Socrates as a statuary or stonemason is in Timon of Philius,Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, s.v., \\"Socrates\\", 1919. as quoted by Diogenes Laërtius 2.19. Burnet claims that Timon \\"is a very unsafe authority for anything\\", and that the attribution \\"appears to have arisen from an almost certainly false interpretation of [Socrates'] references to Daedalus as the ancestor of his family\\" (in Plato's Euthyphro 11c, 15b). Burnet points out that Daedalus had nothing to do with stone-cutting or marble sculpture; his media were instead metal and wood. Burnet furthermore argues that Xenophon and Plato would at some point have explicitly mentioned Socrates' background in stone- craftsmanship, if it were real, since both writers so often make Socrates mention craftsmen.p. 50, Plato's Euthyphro, Apology of Socrates, and Crito, Oxford University Press, 1924. Burnet cites Plato's Apology 22c9ff. and Xenophon's Memorabilia 3.10.6 as passages where the writers could not have avoided mentioning Socrates' own experience with craftsmanship if he really had any. Another early source of the claim that Socrates was a stone-worker is Duris of Samos, who described Socrates as a slave.Cited in Diogenes Laërtius 2.19. According to Eduard Zeller, Duris seems to have confused Socrates with Phaedo of Elis.Zeller, Socrates and the Socratic Schools, trans. O.J. Reichel (London 1877), 2nd edition, p. 60 n. 1. In direct contradiction to Plato's Crito 50d-e, one scholar of ancient Greek music has claimed that \\"Socrates received no training in mousikē in boyhood...\\", based on the assumption that \\"[h]is father, a stonemason, was typical of a class that did not receive a training in mousikē.\\"p. 142, Warren Anderson, Music and Musicians in Ancient Greece, Cornell University Press, 1994. Education in music and gymanastics was in Socrates' time, \\"probably confined to the aristocratic strata...\\", according to the Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd edition, s.v., \\"education, Greek\\". Family connections According to Plato (in the dialogue Laches), Sophroniscus was a close friend of Lysimachus, son of the illustrious Aristides the Just, which (presumably) allowed Socrates to become familiar with members of the circle of Pericles. (Since Plato has Lysimachus refer to Sophroniscus in the past tense, and since the dialogue's dramatic date is not long after the battle of Delium, we may safely infer that Sophroniscus was dead by 424.)p. 235, Debra Nails, The People of Plato, Hackett, 2002. The fact that one of Socrates' sons — but not his eldest son Lamprocles — was named after Sophroniscus suggests that Sophroniscus was the less illustrious of the two grandfathers (John Burnet 1911, Plato: Phaedo, p. 12); the father of Socrates' wife, Xanthippe, was named Lamprocles and had a more impressive pedigree than Sophroniscus. All this suggests that Socrates' inherited social status was in fact much higher than is traditionally recognized.

About a third of the area, consisting mainly of its sea-cliffs, islands and other coastal features, has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports breeding populations of barnacle and brent geese, common eiders and black guillemots. Hot springs The Troll and Jotun hot springs in the park along the edge of the Bockfjorden are the northernmost documented terrestrial hot springs on earth at almost 80 degrees north latitude. The first documentation of these springs was in the late 1800s. Hoel and HoltedahlLavadækkerne, vulkanerne og de varme kilder ved Wood Bay paa Spitsbergen, A. Hoel, O. Holtedahl, Naturen 37, 3-19 (Oslo), 1913. studied these two hot springs in some detail.

At the , Yarloop had a population of 395. On 7 January 2016 a bushfire destroyed most of the town. History The name Yarloop is said to have originated from the words \\"yard loop\\", the rail loop into the timber yard there. However, the name is more likely Aboriginal in origin (most likely from the local Bindjareb Noongar people). Yalup Brook is situated about north of Yarloop and there is similarity in pronunciation of the word, and the early spelling variations of the siding (Yailoup and Yarloup) support it being Aboriginal. In 1849, Joseph Logue arrived in the area and farmed at nearby Cookernup. He was followed by W.J. Eastcott, who used to collect river red gum bark and pit-sawn timber for other settlers, and John Bancells in 1886. In 1894, Charles and Edwin Millar moved into the district looking to put nearby stands of jarrah to use - they had exported jarrah blocks to London for use in street paving. They soon established their own timber town with accommodation and support facilities, located south of a government-surveyed town site as the company wished to maintain effective control over staff and workmen. However, not everyone working at the mill wanted to live in the facilities, so a company town on the eastern side of the railway and a public town on the western side developed. A siding on the Perth-Bunbury Railway came into being in 1896. In 1901, they made Yarloop the centre of their operations, and the town became even more important when in 1905 they closed their Denmark mills on the south coast. At their peak, they employed over 500 people in the Yarloop area. By the 1930s, they boasted the largest private railway in the world with eight railway systems and 25 locomotives. The timber mill, originally known as the Waigerup mill, still operates and in 1984 the mill town was classified as a conservation area by the National Trust and is now protected by the Yarloop Conservation Plan (1998) administered by the Heritage Council. The town was gazetted in 1962. Yarloop Hall (October 2006) Modern era Yarloop became home to citrus growers, dairy farmers, vegetable growers and commuters. Until the bushfire of 2016, the town centre included many restored timber buildings along with the historical steam workshops. The workshops had many operating steam engines along with displays of the equipment used to maintain 25 steam locos and the timber production of millers. There is a heritage trail around the old mill town and conservation area. Facilities included a primary school, local shop, bowling club, hotel, post office, community centre and various types of accommodation. A notable issue in the town was alleged emissions from the Alcoa alumina refinery at nearby Wagerup. For years, some residents have reported illnesses such as respiratory irritation, frequent blood noses, headaches, nausea and cancer, as reported in numerous media outlets, including the Four Corners program \\"Something In The Air\\", although no formal causal link has ever been established. These claims are also disputed by a large section of the local population. Alcoa subsequently obtained permission (September 2006) to double the size of the refinery to become the biggest such refinery in the world, although very strict conditions have been imposed on the expansion by the Health and Environment departments. A minority of the residents announced plans to fight the decision in the Supreme Court. =2016 bushfire= South Western Highway and Johnson Road entrance to Yarloop after the fires On 7 January 2016, 121 homes were destroyed by a massive bushfire. Over a seven-minute period, the fire also burned the historic timber workshops, factories, an old church, the old hospital, shops, the hotel, fire station and a part of the school. Local politician Murray Cowper, observing soon afterwards that the town now looked \\"very surreal\\", said: \\"This could well be the end of the town.\\" Those visiting the town after the fire described the level of destruction as \\"apocalyptic\\". However, Western Australia's Premier Colin Barnett said that the town would be rebuilt, and a majority of residents voted in favour of rebuilding. On 9 January the remains of two men were found in burnt-out houses. Public access to Yarloop was restored on 11 August 2016, seven months after the fire, when roadblocks were removed. =Rebuilding= A new community centre was built, incorporating the facade of the original town hall, and opened in November 2019.

He graduated with a Bachelor of Statistics (B.Stat) degree in 1982 and completed his post-graduation with a Master of Statistics (M.Stat) degree in 1984.  Political views  Bhattacharya states that a large section of the population is rendered invisible in the country and that only a tiny minority holds the reigns of political power and benefits from economic progress. He holds the view that economic growth in India has not coincided with the empowerment of people and defines empowerment as material questions such as employment, education, housing and hygiene, that the policies of privatisation and commercialisation of healthcare and education are contradictory to the vision of an empowered India promoting further dis-empowerment.

After the war, the airport reverted to civilian operation and the runway was extended and paved to its final length. The airport's principal commercial carrier was Leeward Islands Air Transport (LIAT), which linked Grenada to nearby islands with its 48-passenger turboprop aircraft. The airport's surrounding hills and its distance from the capital city of St. George's made it unsuitable for further improvements. On 25 October 1983, Marines from the 8th Marine Regiment landed nearby by helicopter and \\"captured\\" Pearls Airport during the invasion of Grenada, meeting only light resistance. The airport then consisted of a cinder block terminal/operations building and a fuel storage facility. The Marines seized two parked aircraft. One was an AN-26 Cubana Airlines turboprop which had arrived the day before from Havana with two high-level Cuban officials. The other was an AN-2R biplane, a gift to Grenada from the Soviet Union, ostensibly for agricultural spray use.

Written by guitarist and vocalist Noel Gallagher in 2001, the song was originally recorded for the Oasis album Don't Believe the Truth in 2004, but was removed from the final track listing. When the band released a compilation of the same name, it was rumoured that the song would appear as a bonus track on the album, but as of 2009 (and the disbandment of Oasis) the song remained unreleased. A studio performance of the song, believed to be dating from the Don't Believe the Truth recording sessions, as well as a live version performed in May 2003, were leaked onto the internet on 6 May 2008 by an Oasis fansite. On 6 July 2011, it was announced that \\"Stop the Clocks\\" would finally be released on Noel Gallagher's debut solo album, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. The song is similar to a song by The La's, called \\"Looking Glass\\". A song both Gallaghers have praised numerous times. HistoryBackground and composition (2001–2002)= In a November 2006 interview for an Italian broadcast, Noel said that he wrote the song in 2001 while in Thailand. It was written whilst Liam Gallagher was recording vocals for \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\", during recording sessions for Heathen Chemistry, sometime in 2001, and was first mentioned in interviews by Noel in the Autumn of 2002. Noel told Tokyo's J-Wave radio station that it's about, \\"A dream I had one night. It's wondering about if you were dead, how would you know you were actually dead, how would you know you were actually alive. When you go to bed and you dream dreams... if you never woke up, how would you know? Maybe we're all just dreaming now.\\" Stop The Clocks - The Information Page In March 2003, he told Austrian TV show 'Arena' that, \\"it doesn't sound like anything we've done before or anything I've ever written... in its lyrical content it's quite near to The Masterplan\\". More details about the song were revealed by Gallagher at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2004, with Noel telling a backstage programme on BBC Three that the track was seven minutes long and would probably never be performed live because it was, \\"just me and an acoustic guitar and lots of backwards stuff and it's something to be listened to when one is very high\\". It's not known whether Noel was referring to his original demo or if he was referring to a version which had been recorded in early Don't Believe the Truth recording sessions before Glastonbury. =Debut live performance (2003)= On 3 May 2003, Noel played the song in public for the first time at the Zanzibar club in Liverpool. Noel, fellow Oasis guitarist Gem Archer and part-time Oasis percussionist Terry Kirkbride played a five-song semi-acoustic set as a favour to The Bandits, who were headlining at the time. A review passed on to NME said that the song was as a cross between \\"The Hindu Times\\" and \\"Wonderwall\\", similar to late George Harrison-penned Beatles. It features the lyric 'Stop the clocks and leave it all behind / On the backseat of my mind'. Another review, published at AngryApe, said that the song left the crowd \\"divided and unsure\\", adding that it was \\"a fairly melancholic affair crossing \\"Fade In-Out\\" with \\"Who Feels Love?\\". It's classic Oasis but with more soul, fairly mature and well structured as opposed to 3 chord catchy pop songs.\\" =Recording for Don't Believe the Truth (2004–2005)= The song was widely expected to be included on Oasis' 2005 album, Don't Believe the Truth, when it came out in May of that year. However, Noel revealed in a short interview to Q in March 2005 that the song, which was tentatively slotted in at track 7, in between \\"The Meaning of Soul\\" and \\"Part of the Queue\\", might not be included on the album, adding that there was a debate taking place at that moment. The absence of the track was soon confirmed, when Oasis' official web site released the final track listing for the album, with \\"Stop the Clocks\\" nowhere to be seen. During promotional interviews for Don't Believe the Truth, Noel was asked about the song a few times, but he never said anything about the track other than what he talked about in an Oasisinet.com webcast on 22 April 2005. In a two-hour chat with fans, hosted by Gary Crowley, Noel was asked about the song and why it wasn't on the record. He replied: \\"The whole album was kind of based around that song. It was kind of a long \\"Champagne Supernova\\"-type thing and it's got fantastic lyrics and a great vibe, but I felt that we never really got the correct version. We've got 6 or 7 versions of it and not one of them really sat in the pocket for me. But it's there and it will now be on the back burner. Originally the album was going to be called Stop the Clocks, which would have been a great title but, because these songs were so new, that song began to feel very old because it was written in 2001. But it will come out eventually.\\" Noel later revealed that part of Oasis' next studio album could include songs which were written for Don't Believe the Truth and are, in his opinion, equal to anything on that album, but weren't included on it as they didn't quite fit the feel of the record. However, when the album Dig Out Your Soul was released, the song once again was not included. =Possible Stop the Clocks inclusion (2006)= When details were first revealed in July 2006 for an Oasis' best-of album, entitled Stop the Clocks, fans naturally assumed that the song would be included as a bonus track on the album, as is the case with many other artists compilation albums. A track listing, first published in The Sun and reprinted by dozens of other media outlets, included the song, plus another documented unreleased Oasis song, Liam's \\"The Boy with the Blues\\", as the final two songs on the album. However, a denial of this tracklisted was quickly issued by the band's management. Confirmation of the track listing of the album came on 11 September 2006 with no new songs included. At a Q&A; with fans at the world premiere of Oasis' Lord Don't Slow Me Down documentary in New York City on 4 November 2006, Gallagher revealed that the song had been considered for inclusion but was rejected as they still didn't have a finished version that they were happy with releasing. He also revealed that there are versions that he sings on and there are versions with Liam singing. When asked about the absence of any new tracks on the album in press interviews, Noel Gallagher said he thought putting bonus tracks on a 'best-of' album would take the focus away on what was supposed to be a retrospective collection. On BBC Radio 1 on 1 December 2006, Noel Gallagher said of \\"Stop the Clocks\\": \\"Everybody has got different favourite versions - and until we can decide on which one, then it shall remain in the vault. Hopefully we will get around to it next time.\\" He also confirmed that the words on the cover of the Stop the Clocks album are the lyrics to the song. In an interview for MTVU.com, Noel said \\"I did say at the time that it was my best song ever, but I'm kind of prone to saying things like that, as you probably know.\\" =Internet leaks (2008)= On 6 May 2008, an early studio performance of the song was uploaded to various Oasis forums. Also included were various alternative versions of a number of Don't Believe the Truth songs as well as two other unreleased songs. The exact date of the performance is unclear, although it's likely to be from a Don't Believe the Truth recording session, sometime in 2004. A recording of the May 2003 performance was also uploaded to Oasis forums the same day. =Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds (2011)= On 6 July 2011, Noel Gallagher announced full details of his new solo debut album 'High Flying Birds' at a London press conference, with the track \\"Stop the Clocks\\" as the last song on the album. However, it is the only song from the album not to be played on High Flying Birds Tour.

She entered the industry as a sideto supporting actress, and was first noticed for her role as \\"Silk\\" in the 1979 Tamil film, Vandichakkaram. She became a major sex symbol and was the most sought-after erotic actress in the 1980s. In a career spanning 17 years, she appeared in over 450 films in Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Kannada and Hindi languages. On 23 September 1996, she was found dead in her apartment in Chennai, having committed suicide.  Early life  Smitha was born in a Telugu family, to Ramallu and Sarasamma in Kovvali village, Denduluru Mandal, Eluru. She left school after fourth standard (when she was about 10 years of age) due to the family's financial constraints. Her striking looks burdened her with uninvited attention, and her family married her off at a very young age. Her husband and in-laws treated her poorly and she soon ran away.  Career  Smitha started as a touch-up artist for an actress and soon got a break in small character roles. Later, she was discovered by Vinu Chakravarthy, director at a flour mill near AVM studios. He changed her name to Smitha and took her under his wing; his wife taught her English and arranged for her to learn dancing, though soon, due to her marked sex appeal, she switched to roles of cabaret dancers and vamps and inevitably found herself typecast. After garnering much notice and acclaim with her first major role in the Tamil film Vandichakkaram, in 1979, Smitha assumed the screen name \\"Silk\\", after her character's name in the movie. After it became a big hit, she could not escape typecasting, severely limiting her range throughout her career. Smitha went on to star in Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Kannada and a few Hindi films. Her dance numbers and bold performances in films like Moondru Mugam made her the ultimate symbol of sensuality in South Indian cinema. Her item numbers in films like Amaran, Halli Meshtru (in Kannada) were also celebrated at the box office. Some film critics, historians and journalists have referred to her as a \\"soft porn\\" actress. A vast majority of her movies are considered \\"softcore\\" by Indian standards and a common theme is her playing a freakishly strong agent in skimpy bikinis and beating up huge thugs. Her acting prowess did not go completely unnoticed, and in her rare non-sexual roles she impressed critics and audiences, such as her portrayal of a wife hurt by her role in her husband's rape of their maid (which she passively allowed by not preventing him from entering the maid's bathroom and standing \\"guard\\" during the shameful act, to prevent embarrassment to their family) and when she poignantly admitted her mistake in her confrontation of her husband in Alaigal Oivathillai (1981). One of her films, Layanam (1989), has earned cult status in the Indian adult film industry and was dubbed in numerous languages, including Hindi. (Reshma Ki Jawani, 2002), too, acquired cult status. Her most respected film is Moondram Pirai, by Balu Mahendra, remade in Hindi as Sadma, with much of the top-drawer cast, including Sridevi, Kamal Hassan, and Silk Smitha reprising their roles. Such was her audience-drawing power that, at the peak of her career, according to Tamil film historian Randor Guy, \\"Films that had lain in cans for years were sold by the simple addition of a Silk Smitha song.\\"  Personal life  Silk Smitha had a small circle of close friends. She was an introvert and did not make friends quickly with anyone. She is also known for her short temper, willpower and straightforwardness, which some mistook for arrogance. In reality, she was punctual (arriving in movie sets well before the shooting commences), responsible, and ambitious (having learned to speak the English language fluently despite her limited education). She is also described as having a \\"soft\\" and \\"child like\\" personality by her friends and fans. She was skilled with makeup and made it her profession before entering the industry. She was naturally beautiful and well known for her doe-like eyes, golden complexion and physique.  Death  On the morning of September 23, 1996, she contacted her friend, dancer Anuradha, to discuss a matter that was disturbing her. Anuradha planned to visit after dropping her child at school. Arriving later that morning, Anuradha found Smitha dead by hanging. A few months after her death, it was declared in the postmortem report that Smitha died of suicide, with high amounts of alcohol in her body.  Filmography  Legacy  In 2011, a film inspired by Silk Smitha's life, titled The Dirty Picture, was produced in Hindi by Ekta Kapoor. The movie was directed by Milan Luthria and starred Vidya Balan (who later won National Film Award for Best Actress). The movie was released on Smitha's birthday, along with its dubbed versions in Tamil and Telugu (2 December 2011) and received favourable reviews. Reports suggest that the family of Silk Smitha, on whom the film is based, is not happy with the movie. Smitha's brother, V. Naga Vara Prasad, claimed the film was made without the family's consent. After the claim, Ekta Kapoor immediately changed her statement by quoting The Dirty Picture is not based on Silk Smitha's life. However, in 2013, a Kannada film titled Dirty Picture: Silk Sakkath Hot, starring Pakistani actress Veena Malik was released. The film was based on Silk Smitha, and Veena Malik was praised for her performance in the film. The film was a hit in Karnataka. A Malayalam film titled Climax, starring Sana Khan as Silk Smitha released on 24 May 2013.

The rear naked choke (RNC) is a chokehold in martial arts applied from an opponent's back. The word \\"naked\\" in this context suggests that, unlike other strangulation techniques found in Jujutsu/Judo, this hold does not require the use of a keikogi (\\"gi\\") or training uniform. The choke has two variations: in one version, the attacker's arm encircles the opponent's neck and then grabs their own biceps on the other arm (see below for details); in the second version, the attacker clasps their hands together instead after encircling the opponent's neck. \\"Figure four\\" or \\"short\\" variation Soldier executing a figure four variant with body lock.Khmer bas relief of rear naked choke hold. This variant is considered to be a \\"blood choke\\" because it restricts blood flow to the brain via the carotid arteries. When applied correctly, it can cause temporary unconsciousness in a few seconds. The following is a description of this technique using the right arm. #The attacker's right arm encircles the opponent's neck, with the opponent's trachea at the crook of the elbow. #The attacker's right hand then grasps their own upper left arm [biceps]. #The left hand is placed behind (or occasionally on top of) the opponent's head. A more effective form of the choke can be applied by placing the palm of the left hand against the attacker's own shoulder rather than behind the opponent's head. This greatly reduces the escape possibilities. #The elbows are then brought together such that lateral pressure, from the biceps and radius bone, is applied to the neck on both sides. When applied properly, unconsciousness occurs in less than 10 seconds and recovery from the choke is just as quick. \\"Body lock\\" or \\"hooks\\" variation The placement of the legs usually falls into two categories. The first is a body lock. The attacker places one of their legs across the stomach or lower chest of the victim. They then place their other leg over their own shin, creating a figure-four with their legs. This allows them to limit movement and stay close to the back of their victim. This technique was used by Anderson Silva against Dan Henderson and by Jim Miller against Melvin Guillard. The other common technique is known as using \\"hooks\\". In this version the attacker places their legs inside of the victim's legs. They then move their legs out, placing their shin behind the victim's knees, essentially using their shins and feet as hooks to control the victim's legs. This variation leaves the attacker open to the possibility of leglocks from their opponent, as they are attacking the choke.https://jitsmagazine.com/submission-history-the-origins-of-the-rear- naked-choke/  \\"Clasping hands\\" variation  This variation (also known as Palm to Palm) has the supporting hand clasp the hand of the choking arm, allowing more pressure to be applied to the neck, but losing some of the control of the head. This alters the choke somewhat so that it is more likely to be applied as an airway-restricting choke or mixed blood and air choke, which results in more pain but a slower choke-out. As such, this technique is less frequently used at advanced levels in Judo. Nonetheless, it has seen some successful applications in mixed martial arts competition: for instance, it was used by Fedor Emelianenko, a heavyweight champion in PRIDE, to defeat Kazuyuki Fujita at the PRIDE 26 event in 2003. Fujita tapped out about five seconds after the choke was applied. He used it again to defeat former UFC Heavyweight Champion Tim Sylvia in 36 seconds. Sylvia tapped out immediately once the choke was sunk in and after the fight described it as being very painful. It was also used by Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter Matt Hughes to defeat Frank Trigg in their second fight which was adapted from a hand-on-biceps version of the rear naked choke. Anderson Silva also used the clasping hands variation when he defeated Dan Henderson in the UFC. Joe Lauzon used this choke in his fight against Melvin Guillard, initially using the standard version, then switching to a palm to palm. = Judo = In Judo, the rear naked choke is known as Hadaka-jime (): \\"naked choke\\", one of the 36 constriction techniques of Kodokan Judo in the Shime-waza list.  Technique  The main characteristic of Hadaka-Jime when compared with other Judo chokes is that it does not require the use of the opponent's clothing, namely their gi lapel, to create the choking tourniquet. It digs the blade of the wrist into the carotid sinus similar to the hand clasp method and uses a lever motion helped by the underhand. It is faster to apply requiring less strength than the figure four/mixed-martial arts version but is more difficult to learn. It is not an air choke but a carotid choke created entirely by the attacker's arms. =Similar non-judo techniques= Grabbing the opponent's free hand is a way to prevent him from fully locking the choke Hadaka Jime is also recognized as Hadaka-Jime-San in Danzan Ryu jujitsu's twenty-five techniques in the Shimete list. Danzan Ryu also recognizes the Guillotine choke as Hadaka-Jime-Ichi. But the principle is the same as Jiu-Jitsu's ground version.Hadaka Jime Ichi = Included systems = Systems: *Kodokan Judo, Judo Lists *Danzan Ryu jujitsu, Danza Ryu Lists Lists: *The Canon Of Judo *Judo technique =Hasami-jime= Kyuzo Mifune demonstrates Hasami-Jime in The Essence of Judo and is described in The Canon Of Judo.* = Others = Danzan Ryu enumerates three versions of Hadaka-Jime: ;1. Ichi (one): Standing neck- break. Two versions: ;# Neck twist ;# Guillotine ::A version of the guillotine, Mae-Hadaka-Jime, is also described in The Canon Of Judo, an authoritative work that covers the history of judo and its predecessor jujutsu. ;2. Ni (two): Choke with forearm. This is an air choke with the forearm pressing on the throat. ;3. San (three): Figure-4 choke with forearm. This is a blood choke with the forearms and biceps pressing and the sides of the neck. \\"Sleeper hold\\" in professional wrestling National Security Service, Republic of Maldives, executing a sleeper hold variant. The Sleeper Hold was originated in professional wrestling by Evan Lewis in the 1880s when pro wrestling was still a legitimate contest. Lewis earned the nickname \\"Strangler\\" for his use of the hold and was an accomplished catch wrestler using the hold defeating Ernst Roeber for the world championship before eventually losing the title to Martin Burns. In the southeastern United States this move was also known as the Charleston Choke. Modern pro wrestling's first \\"sleeper hold\\", technically different from a choke, which is a compression of the throat and/or adam's apple, is thought to have been performed by Jim Londos on 29 June 1931. Suspicion abounded as to the nature of Londos' move (which had looked suspiciously like a choke against the windpipe); however, Londos was quoted the next day in The New York Sun as simply having performed \\"a new hold I perfected which shuts off the jugular vein.\\" Though Londos' original move may or may not have been inspired by judo's \\"hadaka jime\\", pro- wrestling's sleeper and a rear naked choke both share a similar style of execution. However, in order for the sleeper to be used in the performance art-related world of pro-wrestling, the leverage arm is positioned in a relaxed state so the hold is not fully applied. It is more realistically used by WWE wrestler Samoa Joe (whose wrestling move-set is closer to mixed martial arts). The move has become more of a staple among independent wrestlers, as well as the Japanese wrestlers with the \\"strong style\\" of the sport; the most notable being former MMA star Minoru Suzuki. = Catch wrestling's sleeper = In modern catch wrestling circles, the term \\"sleeper hold\\" refers to a variation of the rear naked choke in which the individual performing the hold snakes the leverage arm across the opponent's throat (in the same manner as the traditional rear naked choke) and grasps their opposite shoulder, rather than the biceps. The opposite hand is also placed against the base of the opponent's skull in the form of a closed Hammer Fist, or on top of the head. The attacking wrestler then squeezes their elbows together, pushes forward with the hammer fist (if used), and crunches forward with the abdominal muscles, producing an extremely tight and fast-acting choke.  Safe application  This choke, in either the figure-four or clasped-hand variation, is an extremely dangerous technique if used thoughtlessly or improperly. When applied as a blood choke in particular, it immediately reduces the supply of oxygen to the brain, leading (as mentioned above) to unconsciousness and ultimately (if not released) to brain damage or death. It is imperative, when using this technique, to be completely aware of your opponent's physical state, and to release the choke at any sign of your opponent losing consciousness. From the sport's inception, no fatalities have been reported as due to choking in judo.

According to Foucault's understanding, power is based on knowledge and makes use of knowledge; on the other hand, power reproduces knowledge by shaping it in accordance with its anonymous intentions. Power (re-) creates its own fields of exercise through knowledge. The relationship between power and knowledge has been always a central theme in the social sciences.  History of the concept  In his 1934 play ‘The Rock’ T. S. Eliot wrote: ‘Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?’. This division between information, knowledge and wisdom inspired many generations of information scientists later on. In the field of political economy, Harold Innis wrote extensively on the \\"monopoly of knowledge\\", in which empires over the history exploited information and communication resources to produce exclusive knowledge and power. In 1943, C. S. Lewis wrote that power granted by knowledge was not power over nature, as commonly supposed, but was instead power that some men wielded over others, using nature to do so.Lewis, C. S. Abolition of Man. 1943.  Foucault's contributions  Foucault was an epistemological constructivist and historicist.Mader, M. B. (2014) Knowledge. Ur Lawlor, L. (red.) & Nale, J. (red.) The Cambridge Foucault Lexicon (s. 226-236). Cambridge University Press, Foucault was critical of the idea that humans can reach \\"absolute\\" knowledge about the world. A fundamental goal in many of Foucault's works is to show how that which has traditionally been considered as absolute, universal and true in fact are historically contingent. To Foucault, even the idea of absolute knowledge is a historically contingent idea. This does however not lead to epistemological nihilism; rather, Foucault argues that we \\"always begin anew\\" when it comes to knowledge.Taylor, D. (2011) Introduction: Power, freedom and subjectivity. Ur Taylor, D. (red.) Michel Foucault: Key Concepts (s. 1-9). Acumen Publishing Ltd., Foucault incorporated mutuality into his neologism power-knowledge, the most important part of which is the hyphen that links the two aspects of the integrated concept together (and alludes to their inherent inextricability). In his later works, Foucault suggests that power-knowledge was later replaced in the modern world, with the term governmentality which points to a specific mentality of governance.  Modern developments  While in most of the 20th century the term ‘knowledge’ has been closely associated with power, in the last decades ‘information’ has become a central term as well. With the growing use of big- data, information is increasingly seen as the means to generate useful knowledge and power. One of the recently developed model, known as the Volume and Control Model, describes how information is capitalized by global corporations and transforms into economic power. Volume is defined as the informational resources—the amount and diversity of information and the people producing it. Control is the ability to channel the interaction between information and people through two competing mechanisms: popularization (information relevant to most people), and personalization (information relevant to each individual person). According to this understanding, knowledge is never neutral, as it determines force relations. The notion of power-knowledge is therefore likely to be employed in critical, normative contexts. One example of the implications of power-knowledge is Google’s monopoly of knowledge, its PageRank algorithm, and its inevitable commercial and cultural biases around the world, which are based on the volume and control principles. A recent study shows, for example, the commercial implications of Google Images algorithm, as all search results for the term 'beauty' in different languages predominantly yield images of white young females.  Connection to Information  In information sciences 'knowledge' is defined as a higher form of information, which requires understanding the patterns and creating useful meaning of the information people collect.

Its name refers to the colour of its hind wings. It is sometimes called the criquet nomade in French, due to its nomadic movements in the dry season. When it forms swarms, it is described as a locust. Nomadacris septemfasciata is in the family Acrididae and is the only member of the genus Nomadacris. The genus Nomadacris was erected in 1923 by Boris Uvarov and the species was named originally as Acridium septemfasciatum by Jean Guillaume Audinet-Serville in 1838. It is placed in the subfamily Cyrtacanthacridinae, the bird locusts. Other species previously placed in Nomadacris are now considered part of the genus Patanga. DescriptionAdults= The overall colour of adult insects is a mixture of light beige and brown. They have seven brown transverse bands on the elytra, justifying the species name septemfasciata. The pronotum has two brown lateral bands. Males are long; females are long. =Nymphs= Unlike adults, the colour of immature insects varies depending on their phase. When solitary, they can be green or brown; when in large numbers (gregarious), they are bright yellow and red-brown with black markings. File:Nomadacris septemfasciata hopper band.jpgHopper band in Iku-Katavi, Tanzania File:Nomadacris septemfasciata hoppers.jpgHoppers on wild sorghum stalk  Ecology Red locusts actively seek out moist environments such as seasonal floodplains. Grains are their primary food source, so grassy lowlands are prime habitat. They also like spending time in trees and thus prefer some tree cover. Red locusts are sedentary when ample shelter, perches, and food are available. In dry years, when the amount of suitable habitat is reduced, population densities increase. If the population density increases past a threshold, the locusts transform into their gregarious phase, changing their behaviour and anatomy. When gregarious, red locusts keep together in large swarms and fly with the wind in daylight hours, looking for more food. The higher temperatures during daylight enable gregarious locusts to travel longer distances by flying longer and higher, aided by thermal lift. A swarm rarely moves more than 20–30 km in a day. In contrast, solitary locusts prefer to fly in the dark and do so alone. Compared to their solitary phase, gregarious red locusts also have: * reduced lifespan * more markings * six instar stages rather than seven * longer sexual maturation * larger and heavier young, although they lay fewer eggs Swarming females often lay eggs at night. Their young immediately behave gregariously and are capable of \\"hopping\\" hundreds of metres every day. Outbreaks Outbreak areas have been identified in Zambia, Tanzania, Malawi, Madagascar, and Réunion. In the Sahel, the species is observed on a more incidental basis in Cape Verde, the central Niger River delta in Mali, and around Lake Chad. The last widespread plague occurred from 1930-1944, when almost all of southern Africa was invaded. Hoppers killed by the fungus Metarhizium acridum After unsuccessful efforts to control the locusts through environmental modifications, chemical agents are currently being used. A biological product based on an entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium acridum, is now available (see desert locust). It has been successfully tested on both nymphs and adults of the red locust.

The LP was introduced by Columbia's Goddard Lieberson in 1948. Lieberson was later president of Columbia Records from 1956-71 and 1973-75\\\\. According to György Marx he was one of The Martians.  Life and early career  Born into a Hungarian-Jewish family, Goldmark got his first exposure to television in 1926 while in graduate school in Vienna. He later hoped to work with John Logie Baird but was turned down for a job after meeting Baird for lunch in London. In 1936, Goldmark joined CBS Laboratories, and one year later he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Goldmark married Frances Trainer, whom he divorced. Together they had four children; three sons: Peter Jr., Christopher, Andrew and one daughter: Frances. After divorcing Frances Trainer, Goldmark married Diane Davis and had two more children: Jonathan and Susan.  Work  In addition to his work on the LP record, Goldmark developed field-sequential color technology for color television while at CBS. The system, first demonstrated on August 29, 1940, and shown to the press on September 3 Current Broadcasting 1940. used a rapidly rotating color wheel that alternated transmission in red, green and blue. The system transmitted on 343 lines, about 100 less than a black and white set, and at a different field scan rate, and thus was incompatible with television sets currently on the market without an adapter.Color Television System Development - CBS System Although CBS did broadcast in color with the Goldmark system in 1950–1951, the \\"compatible color\\" technology developed for RCA and NBC (by a team led by Richard Kell, George H. Brown and others) was compatible with existing black and white TVs. Goldmark and others have pointed out that the CBS color wheel system did provide better picture quality (although lower image resolution) than RCA's system, but the compatibility problem proved its downfall. An improved RCA/NBC color system submitted in July 1953 became the industry standard chosen by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in December 1953. Ironically, cameras using the color wheel system continued to be used for scientific research for several more decades, including the color lunar surface TV cameras during all the 1970s NASA Apollo moon landings. Goldmark also continued his work in developing new LP-related technologies, such as the Highway Hi-Fi, a system designed to play 7-inch LP records in automobiles. After the success of the LP record, Goldmark spent the next two decades at CBS Laboratories working on various inventions, chief of which was EVR, the Electronic Video Recorder. This futuristic home video playback device used reels of film stored in plastic cassettes to electronically store audio and video signals, and was first announced in 1967. A B&W; prototype was demonstrated in 1969 (promising color playback in future models), but the invention floundered when it proved to be difficult and costly to manufacture. CBS was also concerned about the potential of competition from home video devices, particularly those that could record — a fear that eventually proved prescient.For more on EVR and a rare EVR cartridge donated to the Library of Congress, see http://www.bekers.org/EVR.htm. As with color television, Goldmark's EVR film- based system was superseded by another technology, in this case Sony's U-Matic 3/4\\" videocassette format in late 1971, since the cassette tape format was cheaper and more effective. However, Goldmark's vinyl long-playing records remained the standard in the music industry until the CD replaced the LP in the late 1980s.  Later life  Goldmark was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1969. He received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1970. Approaching the mandatory company retirement age of 65, Goldmark left CBS Laboratories in 1971, and formed Goldmark Communications, where he pursued research on the use of communication technologies to provide services like teleconferencing and remote medical consultations to people in rural areas. Funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation in the early 1970s, the \\"New Rural Society Project\\" was housed at Fairfield University in Fairfield, Conn., and conducted pilot studies across the state in Eastern Connecticut's relatively rural Windham region. In 1969 he was awarded the David Sarnoff Medal by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. In 1972, he was recognized for his leadership in the field of technology innovation by the Industrial Research Institute when presented with the illustrious IRI Medal. On November 22, 1977, President Jimmy Carter presented Goldmark with the National Medal of Science \\"For contributions to the development of the communication sciences for education, entertainment, culture and human service.\\" Goldmark died in an automobile accident on December 7, 1977, in Westchester County, New York.

It is 23 km south of Broomehill. The area around Tambellup was first settled by pastoralists in the late 1840s, and in 1849 the Surveyor General, John Septimus Roe, when passing through the area, referred to Morrison's south west station at \\"Tambul-yillup\\". The area was later settled by the Norrish family, and the spelling commonly used for the place then was \\"Tambellelup\\". When the Great Southern Railway was opened in 1889 a station was established at Tambellup, and it appears that the shortened version of the name was created by the railway, as the timetable in 1889 uses the Tambellup spelling. Tambellup was gazetted a townsite in 1899. The meaning of this Aboriginal name is not known, although one source gives it as \\"place of thunder\\" (from Toombellanup). Another explanation is that Tambellup means \\"the place of many Tammars\\", Tammar being the Noongar word for a small marsupial that used to frequent the area. Tambellup's main street is Norrish Street, named after its first European settler, Josiah Norrish (1841-1884), who in 1872 was attracted to the area by its large stands of Santalum spicatum (commonly known as sandalwood). Today, the main industry in Tambellup is sheep farming, while sandalwood continues as a distant second. Much of the sandalwood is exported, and used in the manufacture of joss sticks. The Gordon River has flooded several times since Tambellup was established. The first recorded flood was in 1913, then again in 1937, then a major flood in 1955 when the river rose resulting in some parts of the town being underwater. In January 1982, a decaying tropical cyclone passed over the catchment area feeding the Gordon River causing it to flood the town. Much of the town, including the main street, was covered to a depth of about . The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.

The town is at an elevation of . At the , Wentworth Falls had a population of 6,076. Wentworth Falls hosts several festivals and events, including the Wentworth Falls Autumn Festival in April, the Wentworth Falls Public School Art and Craft Show in October and the Task Force 72 Annual Regatta in either November or December. Wentworth Falls is home to WFCC or Wentworth Falls Cricket Club. Established in 1892 it is one of the Blue Mountains' longest serving cricket clubs. History Kings Tableland, a plateau located at the south-east corner of Wentworth Falls, contains areas of major archaeological importance, including the Kings Tableland Aboriginal Site. This area is highly significant to the Gandangara, Darug and Wiradjuri people. Used as a gathering place for at least 22,000 years, the area contains a variety of cultural features, including engravings, axe-grinding grooves, modified rock pools and an occupation shelter. Originally called The Weatherboard after the ‘Weatherboard Inn’ built in 1814, a year later the town was named Jamison’s Valley by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in honour of the colony's leading private citizen, Sir John Jamison. In July 1867, the first railway journey to the Blue Mountains left Penrith and traveled through to Weatherboard Station, where the train terminated. In 1879, the village took its name from a nearby system of waterfalls, which in turn were named for William Charles Wentworth, one of the men that headed the exploration to cross the mountains in 1813 and a friend of John Jamison.\\"Origin of Blue Mountains Town Names..\\" Blue Mountains City Council On the north side of the town is Pitt Park. The Bathurst Traveller, later renamed Weatherboard Inn, was built here in 1826. The site, adjacent to the railway station, is now the location of the village war memorial. Charles Darwin was reported to have stayed there in 1836, walking from the inn along Jamison Creek to the cliff’s edge, about which he wrote ‘an immense gulf unexpectedly opens through the trees, with a depth of perhaps 1,500 feet’. The route he took was formally opened as the Charles Darwin Walk in 1986 and leads from Wilson Park opposite the School of Arts building to the northern escarpment of the Jamison Valley. The Kings Tableland area also once hosted a deer park that closed down in the late 1980s, with the site subsequently falling into private ownership. Several deer were sighted around the area for some time until they were culled by National Parks rangers. This area is also home to the site of the former Queen Victoria Sanitorium, once a major facility for the treatment of tuberculosis. Ownership of the site has shifted between Government and various private interests over the decades since it was closed in the 1980s. Sporadic development proposals for the former hospital have been the source of some local concern.

Tourism Ingar Camp Ground, one of the most scenic picnic grounds in the Blue Mountains, is eight kilometres further east along Murphys Fire Trail. Further south along Kings Tableland are Sunset Lookout and McMahon’s Lookout, both of which provide long views over Lake Burragorang. These roads went into the Burragorang Valley prior to the valley's flooding by Warragamba Dam. Other points of interest and local institutions include the historic Grand View Hotel, the Wentworth Falls School of Arts, Falls Gallery, located on Falls Road close to the Falls themselves, showing some of the major contemporary Australian artists. The Kedumba Gallery (found within the grounds of the Blue Mountains Grammar School) and Wentworth Falls Lake, an artificial lake created early in the 20th century to provide water for steam locomotives. This is now a reserve and recreation area. The School of Arts is a popular venue for local community events and theatre productions and also houses the local library. Another landmark is Yester Grange, a heritage-listed home in Yester Street.

The FPMT has grown to encompass over 160 Dharma centers, projects, and services in 37 countries. Since the death of Lama Yeshe in 1984, the FPMT's spiritual director has been Lama Zopa Rinpoche. Location The FPMT's international headquarters are in Portland, Oregon (USA). The central office has previously been located at: * 2000-2005 Taos, New Mexico * 1989-2000 Soquel, California (Land of Medicine Buddha) * 1984-1989 Pomaia, Italy (Istituto Lama Tzong Khapa) * 1975-1984 Kathmandu, Nepal (Kopan Monastery) The FPMT has 165 centers in 40 countries worldwide.  History  The name and structure of the FPMT date to 1975, in the wake of an international teaching tour by Lamas Yeshe and Zopa. However, the two had been teaching Western travelers since at least 1965, when they met Zina Rachevsky, their student and patron, in Darjeeling. In 1969, the three of them founded the Nepal Mahayana Gompa Centre (now Kopan Monastery). Rachevsky died shortly afterwards during a Buddhist retreat. Lama Yeshe resisted Rachevsky's appeals to teach a \\"meditation course,\\" on the grounds that in the Sera Monastery tradition in which he was educated, \\"meditation\\" would be attempted only after intensive, multi-year study of the Five Topics. However, he gave Lama Zopa permission to lead what became the first of Kopan's meditation courses (then semiannual, now annual) in 1971.Wangmo p. 241 Lama Zopa led these courses at least through 1975 (and occasionally thereafter). During the early 1970s, hundreds of Westerners attended teachings at Kopan. Historical descriptions and recollections routinely characterize early Western participants as backpackers on the hippie trail (extended overland tours of Asia)—to whom Lama Yeshe's style of discourse especially appealed. Geoffrey Samuel finds it significant that Lamas Yeshe and Zopa had not yet attracted followings among the Tibetan or Himalayan peoples (Zopa's status as a minor tulku notwithstanding), and that their activities took place independently of any support or direction from the Central Tibetan Administration in Dharamsala. On his reading, their willingness to reach out to Westerners was in large measure the result of a lack of other sources of support. Nevertheless, Samuel sees their cultivation of an international network as having ample precedent in Tibet.Samuel, p. 301 ff. In December 1973, Lama Yeshe ordained fourteen Western monks and nuns under the name of the International Mahayana Institute. Around this time, Lama Yeshe's students began returning to their own countries. The result was the founding of an ever-increasing number of dharma centers in those countries. In his description of the FPMT, Jeffrey Paine emphasizes the charisma, intuition, drive, and organizational ability of Lama Yeshe. Paine asks us to consider how a refugee with neither financial resources nor language skills could manage to create an international network with more than a hundred centers and study groups. David N. Kay (see bibliography) makes the following observation: :\\"Lama Yeshe's project of defining and implementing an efficient organizational and administrative structure within the FPMT created the potential for friction at a local level. The organization's affiliated centers had initially been largely autonomous and self-regulating, but towards the late-1970s were increasingly subject to central management and control.\\"Kay, pp. 61-62. As a result, says Kay (and Samuel's analysis concurs), at the same time that the FPMT was consolidating its structure and practices, several local groups and teachers defected, founding independent networks. Geshe Loden of Australia's Chenrezig Institute left the FPMT in 1979, in order to focus on his own network of centers. More consequentially, Kelsang Gyatso and his students caused the Manjushri Institute, the FPMT's flagship center in England, to sever its FPMT ties. At issue was whether the centers and their students ought to identify primarily with Lama Yeshe, local teachers, the Gelugpa tradition, or Tibetan Buddhism as a whole. The FPMT now asks its lamas to sign a \\"Geshe Agreement\\" which make explicit the organization's expectations.Kay, p. 65 The latter rift widened in the wake of unrelated, post-1996 controversy over Dorje Shugden; the FPMT accepts the 14th Dalai Lama's ban on the worship of this deity, which only applies to those who wish to be his own disciples.The Shugden Issue - policy statement by the FPMT, accessed 26 July 2012. Lama Yeshe's death in 1984 led to his succession as spiritual director by Lama Zopa. In 1986, a Spanish boy named Tenzin Ösel Hita (a.k.a. Tenzin Ösel Rinpoche, or \\"Lama Ösel\\") was identified as the tulku of Lama Yeshe. As he came of age, Hita gave up his robes for a secular life, attending university in Spain, and became relatively inactive in the FPMT. In 2009, was quoted in several media sources as renouncing his role as a tulku—remarks which he later disavowed. Structure The FPMT is headed by a board of directors, with its spiritual director (presently Lama Zopa) a member. The FPMT International Office represents the board's executive function. The president / CEO of the FPMT is currently (2019) Ven. Roger Kunsang.FPMT Board of Directors https://fpmt.org/fpmt/international- office/board-of-directors/ There are over 160 FPMT dharma centres, projects, services and study groups in 40 countries. Each affiliated center, project or service is separately incorporated and locally financed. There is no such thing as FPMT \\"membership\\" for individuals; rather, membership is held only by organizations (although several of these offer their own, local membership to individuals). In addition to its local board and officers, each FPMT center also has a spiritual program coordinator and in many cases, a resident geshe or teacher (and perhaps other Sangha as well). The center directors and spiritual program coordinators from various countries meet every few years as the Council for the Preservation for the Mahayana Tradition (CPMT), in order to share experience and deliberate points of mutual concern. The 14th Dalai Lama is credited with the honorary role of \\"inspiration and guide\\". Programs Students often first encounter the FPMT via short courses and retreats held at the various centers. The prototype of these is Kopan Monastery's annual month-long meditation course, offered since 1971. Many FPMT centers have adopted standardized curricula, whose modules may also be obtained on DVD for external study. The three sequences were separately developed, and thus are only loosely correlated with one another. They are as follows: :*Discovering Buddhism, a two-year, fourteen-module lamrim course. :*The FPMT Basic Program (five years, nine modules). As of 2015, at least thirty FPMT centers teach the Basic Program, or components thereof. Students desiring more advanced study have a number of options including: :*The FPMT Masters Program (since 1998) -- 7 years traditional study using compressed version of the Geshe curriculum. Designed to produce credentialed FPMT teachers. Its courses are mainly--but not exclusively--hosted by the Istituto Lama Tzong Khapa in Pomaia, Italy. :*Maitripa College in Portland, Oregon (founded 2005, formal program began in 2006) -- 3-year MA (in Buddhist Studies) and MDiv programs. The school intends to apply for regional accreditation. :*Lotsawa Rinchen Zangpo Translator Program (since 1996) -- 2 years intensive Tibetan language study in Dharamsala, followed by 2 years interpretation residency. Designed to train FPMT interpreters. In addition, numerous centers are prepared to supervise a meditation retreat. Projects FPMT maintains a number of charitable projects, including funds to build holy objects; translate Tibetan texts; support monks and nuns (both Tibetan and non-Tibetan); offer medical care, food and other assistance in impoverished regions of Asia; re-establish Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia; and protect animals. Perhaps the highest-profile FPMT project to date is the Maitreya Project. Originally a planned colossal statue of Maitreya to be built in Bodhgaya and/or Kushinagar (India), the project has been reconceived in the face of fund-raising difficulties and controversy over land acquisition, and now intends to construct a number of relatively modest statues. Also to note is the Sera Je Food Fund offering 3 meals a day to the 2600 monks who are studying at Sera Je Monastery since 1991.FPMT, Sera Je Food Fund Jeffrey Paine, commenting glowingly on the FPMT's various projects, writes: :\\"The FPMT, nonprofit, staffed by individual volunteers, oversees activities from publishing books to feeding three thousand monks at the new Sera monastery in India. The FPMT's 'Mongolia Project' has revived Buddhism in that country. [...] The FPMT now plans to build near Bodhgaya the largest Buddha statue in the world, which will house whole temples inside of it. [Note: these plans have since changed.] If built, it will dwarf the Statue of Liberty. It may eventually even dwarf the legend of Yeshe, the little lama who fled Tibet never having met a Westerner, knowing no European language, and then...\\" Kay, p. 75.

It is the main town in the Shire of Lake Grace. At the 2016 census, Lake Grace had a population of 507. History The area was first taken up for agriculture around 1911. In 1913 a school was established and named Lake Grace after the nearby lake. In 1914 the government planned to extend the railway network from Kukerin to Lake Grace, and local settlers lobbied for a townsite to be declared at the terminus. The railway was completed on 25 November 1916, and terminated close to the site of the existing school. The townsite of Lake Grace was gazetted later in 1916. The branch railway was extended to the ultimate terminus at Newdegate on 15 February 1926 and a further branch from Lake Grace to Hyden opened on 5 April 1933, making Lake Grace a junction and therefore of some importance for train working operations.All Change at Lake Grace, Milne, Rod Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, May, 1994 pp131-136 In 1922 the Reverend John Flynn visited the town to assess the suitability for establishing an Australian Inland Mission (AIM) hospital. The Western Australian Government agreed to subsidise the building of the hospital, which was subsequently built by AIM and opened in April 1926 staffed by two nurses, Olive Bennett and Helen Cousin. In July 1934 the Lake Grace Hospital Board repaid the loan from the Australian Inland Mission and took over the ownership of the hospital. The hospital served an area of including providing maternity ward facilities. The hospital ceased operation in 1952 with the construction and replacement by the Lake Grace Memorial Hospital. The Lake Grace AIM Hospital building was in disrepair by 1983 with the state Government deciding to demolish the building. Protests by former staff and the local community halted the destruction, and the building was restored as a museum with the help of the Lake Grace Shire Council and the local community. Lake Grace Australian Inland Mission Hospital Museum The building is one of three remaining Australian Inland Mission hospitals and is listed on local, state and national heritage registers. The lake after which the townsite was named was given the name Lake Grace by Marshall Fox, the District Surveyor, in 1910. It is named after Grace Brockman, the wife of the then Surveyor General, Frederick S Brockman. Grace Brockman became famous in 1876 when she, as Grace Bussell, and her stockman Sam Isaacs, rescued many people from the wreck of the \\"Georgette\\" near the mouth of the Margaret River. Nat Fyfe, the AFL 2015/2019 Brownlow Medalist is from Lake Grace. =Present day= Lake Grace is located on the \\"cross roads\\" with it being half way between Perth and Esperance as well as acting as a main through point for those traveling between Albany and the Wheatbelt. Many tourists use these alternative routes when traveling to and from the Eastern States. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling. Recently changes have included the development of the \\"Multi Art Space\\", the introduction of a visitor centre in the old station master's house and an improved townscape. A range of economic developments are underway including a new residential sub-division and light industrial area. There is also Living Towns Lake Grace where over 130 commercial enterprises are working together to improve the local economy. Local artists have added a new dimension to the town. The \\"Multi Art Space\\" allows local residents to learn and participate in key artistic projects. Many of the artistic works are based on recycled materials such as plastic bags, aluminum cans and plastic bottle tops. A number of local residents have become award winning artists including Kerrie Argent, who won the Cottesloe Sculpture by the Sea People's Choice Prize in 2010 for evidence – the trail continues. The Lake Grace Visitor Centre open five days a week. The Visito Centre is located in the old station master's house which was restored by local residents in 2005. On display are local information guides, the history of Lake Grace, locally made products and a native seed bank. Lake Grace is part of a region that contains the most diverse recognized flora in the World. Locals played a key role in restoring the AIM hospital, now a museum that displays primary health care prior to 1960. Lake Grace contains a district high school with distance learning available for years 11 and 12. There is a district hospital, a childcare centre and a medical centre with a doctor and other health services. There are two banks in town: BankWest and Rabobank that opened in September 2009. The shopping facilities include a local shopping forum with IGA supermarket open seven days, a butcher, health & beauty, hair dresser and clothing shop. The two cafes Rosies and Arjos are well patronised, with the latter open Monday to Saturday. There is also a Retravision, CCL Hardware (open seven days) and resident electrical contractor and plumber. The town has a Community Pharmacy opened in 2014. There is a range of recreational facilities available including a 50-metre pool, sporting complex including footy, cricket, tennis, basketball and hockey. The Sportsman's Club also has a synthetic bowling surface allowing bowls to be played all year round. There is also a golf club and air strip. Travellers' facilities include the local hotel-motel, roadhouse, the Salt Bush Inn motel and the Lake Grace Caravan Park. There is also a number of B&Bs; in the area. The local shire council is based in Lake Grace and there is a Community Resource Centre (telecentre). The town is served three days per week by the Transwa Perth to Esperance bus service. GeographyClimate= Lake Grace experiences a steppe climate (Köppen climate classification BSh). =Natural disasters= In late 2005 and early 2006, Lake Grace experienced two natural disasters. The first was a hail storm on 16 October 2005, which destroyed 500 hectares of wheat and barley crop and damaged a further 5,500 hectares, with some farmers reporting fields covered by up to of hail and kilometres of road turned white. It was accompanied by about 60 mm of rainfall. On 13 January 2006, the town was flooded by Cyclone Clare, receiving 230 mm of rainfall. It was declared a disaster zone by the State Government. Just over two weeks later, the town received another 30 mm of rain from Tropical Cyclone Emma. Large pumps were brought in to help dry out flooded roads, and the main highway to Perth was reopened six weeks later. Lake Grace normally receives 353.3 mm of rainfall per annum with 16.3 mm in January.

Its most famous period was from 1964 to 1988 at 90 Wardour Street in Soho, and it finally closed when at 105 Charing Cross Road in 1996, though the name has been revived unsuccessfully three times in the 21st century. It was always a small and relatively cheap club, located in the heart of the music industry in London's West End, and used to launch the careers of generations of rock acts. It was a key venue for early performances by bands who were to achieve worldwide fame in the 1960s and remained a venue for young bands in the following decades. It was the location of the first-ever live performance by the Rolling Stones on 12 July 1962.\\"The Rolling Stones 40 years anniversary Marquee Club, London, July 12, 1962\\", The Rolling Stones Fan Club of Europe. It's Only Rock'n Roll. Origins The club was established by Harold Pendleton, an accountant whose love of jazz had led him to become secretary of the National Jazz Federation. Originally it was located in the Marquee Ballroom in the basement of the Academy Cinema in Oxford Street, where dances had been held since the early 1950s. Its decor was designed by Angus McBean with a striped canopy to imitate a marquee. Pendleton took over management of the ballroom, and the first Jazz at the Marquee night was held on 19 April 1958. Johnny Dankworth, Chris Barber, Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies were early resident performers, and Tubby Hayes and Joe Harriott were also regular performers. In 1962 the club began a regular R&B; night that occasionally featured visiting American musicians such as Muddy Waters. Pendleton also launched the National Jazz Festival in 1961 in Richmond; this was the precursor to the Reading and Leeds Festivals. By 1963 the club had become most noted for its R&B; acts, including Davies, Brian Auger and Manfred Mann–who played there a record 102 times between 1962 and 1976–but Pendleton was forced to find a new venue when his lease expired. The 1960s: Rock roots The former site of the Marquee Club in Wardour Street, Soho, London, as it now looks (2018). Richmond Mews, Soho (2018), where the back loading entrance to the Marquee Club was located and also where the Marquee Studios were housed. Keith Moon's plaque, 90 Wardour Street. In March 1964, the club moved a short distance to what became its most famous venue with an entrance at 90 Wardour Street, with the actual music venue housed over two buildings. Here, almost every major rock band of note played over the next 25 years on the tiny stage. ‘The Marquee in Wardour Street did not have an alcohol licence until 1970. Jack Barrie along with agent Kenny Bell came up with the idea of opening a private bar above The Marquee at 100 Wardour Street that was called La Chasse.Mabel Greer's Toyshop (interview) by Valerie Siebert Author End, 30 January 2015La Chasse (drinking bar) article 5 November 2008 (retrieved 3 July 2018) Band residencies during the late 1960s included Alexis Korner, Cyril Davies, Chris Barber, the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin, the Who, King Crimson, the Syn, Mabel Greer's Toyshop, Yes, Jethro Tull, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Pink Floyd (who played on Sunday afternoons as part of the Spontaneous Underground club). Another band that made regular appearances was the Manish Boys featuring David Bowie, who first played there in November 1964; and Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac gave their first performance there in 1967. To find out who was playing on any given night, you could just call in at the 'Ship' pub a few doors away. In 1964, Moody Blues manager/producer Alex Murray used a homemade studio in the garage at the back of the club to produce the classic \\"Go Now\\" single, which shot to No. 1 at Christmas 1964, and filmed for it the first ever UK pop promo video. The development of Marquee Studios was largely financed by profits from this record. The studio was later used by Elton John, the Groundhogs, the Clash and others. The Rolling Stones, who first appeared at the club in January 1963, returned there on 26 March 1971 after an eight-year hiatus to film a television special. John Gee, a former accountant and journalist, became the manager of the Marquee Club during the 1960s and was a pivotal part of helping create what the Melody Maker termed \\"the most important venue in the history of pop music\\". Gee championed certain groups that played at the club such as Ten Years After and Jethro Tull, and wrote the liner notes for Ten Years After's eponymous 1967 debut album. Jethro Tull named the B-side of their second single, \\"A Song For Jeffrey\\", a jazz- flavoured instrumental, \\"One for John Gee\\". Gee introduced the bands to the audience before they appeared on stage. He left the Marquee Club in 1970 to take a job in the offices of Radio Luxembourg. Jack Barrie, who was the former manager of the Soho bar La Chasse took over as the manager of the Marquee in 1970. The 1970s The Marquee Club also nurtured a large social scene based around the record industry, with record company heads and their A&R; representatives visiting the venue on a daily basis, often talent spotting. The venue also attracted many famous musicians and recording artists who simply used the VIP Bar to socialise in. The Marquee staff became an integral part of the club as much as the bands that performed there. The Faces performed at The Marquee on 7 December 1970. Queen performed at the club three times in the beginning of their career. First on 8 January 1971, then on 20 December 1972, and on 9 April 1973, as their first gig after signing with the Trident record company. In 1972, Status Quo took to the stage with a blistering set, including \\"Paper Plane\\", the video for which was filmed during this gig. On 18, 19 & 20 October 1973, Be-Bop Deluxe and String Driven Thing appeared on the same bill in 1974, David Bowie filmed The 1980 Floor Show at the Marquee for the American NBC TV late night show The Midnight Special.David Bowie's 1980 Floor Show (retrieved 2 July 2018) NBC used the Marquee Studios (housed beside the venue) as dressing rooms for the cast. Although never a seminal punk venue, the club nevertheless embraced the burgeoning punk rock movement of the late 1970s and regularly promoted punk and new wave nights into the 1980s. Bands such as Sex Pistols, X-Ray Spex, the Boys, Eddie and the Hot Rods, the Stranglers, Generation X, London, the Police, XTC, Skrewdriver, the Sinceros, Buzzcocks, the early Adam & the Ants, the Jam, Joy Division, the Sound and the Cure all trod the famous Wardour Street stage. Mainstream rock acts like Dire Straits (on their first tour, 5 and 6 July 1978), Alexis Korner, Steve Hillage, Rory Gallagher, Racing Cars, the Enid, Hanoi Rocks, the Tyla Gang, Universe and Karakorum (featuring Martin Chambers, later of the Pretenders) also appeared regularly at the venue. The 1980s During the early to mid-1980s the Marquee became an important venue to the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM). Def Leppard played their first show on the Pyromania World Tour here, and included a different setlist from the rest of the shows on that tour. There was a glam revival spearheaded by Hanoi Rocks, the Babysitters, the Quireboys and others. NWOBHM bands, such as Angel Witch, Diamond Head, Witchfynde and Praying Mantis were regulars. Iron Maiden played at the club in 1980 and were filmed performing for LWT documentary 20th Century Box (introduced by a very young Danny Baker). Metallica performed their first UK show at the venue on 27 March 1984. In April 1985 Robin Trower recorded the majority of his live album Beyond the Mist at the Marquee Club. This album also includes two new studio tracks and an extended 10-minute version of \\"Bridge of Sighs\\". The Marquee was the central venue of the progressive rock revival of the early 1980s. It was here that the then- unsigned Marillion began to gain a wider fan base and press interest by playing frequent two-night residencies to a sold-out crowd. Other neo- progressive rock acts of the time regularly headlining at the club included Twelfth Night, Solstice and Pallas, often supported by acts such as Pendragon or IQ who would in later years become leading lights of the \\"neo-prog\\" scene. Other progressive bands regularly playing the Marquee at this time included Quasar, Mach One, Haze, Cardiacs, Legacy of Lies and Liaison (who were not strictly prog but seemed to become linked to the movement). During this period the club held heats and the final of Melody Maker's \\"band contests\\". New wave and indie bands appeared, including \\"Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please\\" one-hit wonders Splodgenessabounds and the almost-cult band the Hummers. In 1985, Wham! filmed the video for \\"I'm Your Man\\" there, clearly showing the Marquee name. Final location, closure and subsequent re-use of the name In 1988 Harold Pendleton sold the club to Billy Gaff, the former manager of Rod Stewart. The Wardour Street site was sold for redevelopment (it is now Meza and Floridita with a cigar retail shop, Spanish restaurant and Cuban restaurant and some flats), and the Marquee Club was forced to move again, this time to a larger venue at the former Cambridge Circus Cinematograph Theatre, 105 Charing Cross Road. During this period, American progressive metal band Dream Theater recorded their first live album, Live at the Marquee, at the venue on 23 April 1993. Additionally, American group All Mod Cons: A Tribute to the JAM drew the largest ever crowd at this location in October 1993. This site was subsequently bought for redevelopment and the club closed in 1996. A Wetherspoons pub named \\"The Montagu Pyke\\" now occupies the building. Ballboy at the Marquee Club on 13 August 2005 The Marquee was relocated in 2001 by Billy Gaff and entrepreneur Doug Palfreeman to Angel, Islington in a purpose-built space. It was then sold on to Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics. However, with Stewart's team this hit financial difficulties and closed in 2003, less than a year after it had opened. It is now O2 Academy, Islington Under new owner entrepreneur Nathan Lowry The Marquee Club re-opened in 2004 in the heart of London's West End at One Leicester Square above MTV's TRL studio. Jimmy Page re-opened the club. The opening night was called the Breakthrough Weekender featuring dozens of new/unsigned artists. A Jimi Hendrix exhibition ran for three months featuring a huge collection of original guitars and unseen footage at the club before being auctioned by Mick Fleetwood's auction company Fleetwood Owen. The club successfully featured over 500 new and established bands during its time here, including Razorlight, the Feeling, and the Magic Numbers. Many music industry launches were held at the club including the Download Festival featuring Ozzy, Green Day, Billy Idol and Snow Patrol. Both MTV and the club closed with the Marquee citing licensing problems with Westminster Council. It continued as a pop up in St Martins Lane for another year until closing in 2008. Lowry continues to hold the exclusive brand rights.

Retrieved on 27 September 2011. \\"Physical Address: Ster-Kinekor Office Park 185 Katherine Street Eastgate Ext.4 Sandton\\" History The company originated in 1969 when 20th Century Fox decided to sell off its South African theatre business to Sanlam, an insurance company. Sanlam had already been operating Ster Theatres and Ster Films under the Ster brand. Government regulation required that the two film companies be operated separately, and so the company name Kinekor was born to manage the newly acquired business. Throughout the 1970s, Kinekor embarked on a program of opening new cinemas across South Africa. However, due to the introduction of television in 1976, cinema attendances dropped. Because of this, the South African government then allowed Sanlam to merge its two theatres divisions, creating Ster-Kinekor. Despite poor market conditions, Ster-Kinekor continued its program of building high-quality cinema multiplexes, focusing on integrating cinemas into large retail and leisure developments. =Expansion into Europe= The end of South Africa's isolation in 1994 also introduced a free market, allowing Ster-Kinekor to expand into foreign markets. Three company directors moved their base of operations to the United Kingdom and set up trading as Ster Century. The newly founded Ster Century entered into partnership with Assos Odeon, a cinema exhibition company in Greece, and opened its first multiplex cinema in 1998 under the name of Ster Odeon. In 1999, Ster Century continued its expansion opening multiplex cinemas in Dublin, Ireland; Brno, Czech Republic; Wroclaw and Warsaw, Poland; and two sites in Budapest, Hungary. This trend continued in 2000, with two additional sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, and more in the UK (Edinburgh, Romford and Norwich), Spain, Montenegro, Greece, Slovakia, and Serbia. =Leaving Europe= By summer 2002, Ster Century had sold off its interests in Poland, Greece, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to concentrate on its UK business. Cinemas were opened in Leeds, Basingstoke, and Cardiff. Polish cinemas were sold to the Israeli company Cinema City International. In 2003, Ster-Kinekor sold off its remaining European cinema interests with Ster Century's UK business being bought by Aurora Entertainment in a management buyout. Competition In South Africa, Ster-Kinekor holds the largest market share in its industry, with its primary competition being other South African cinema operators, Nu Metro Cinemas and CineCentre.

Since they will never \\"taste death\\", in the Book of Mormon the Nephite prophet Mormon contemplates if they are already immortal. After Mormon prays for wisdom, Jesus tells him that there would be another change made at his coming so that they may become immortal. Similar to Mormon beliefs about John the Apostle, the Three Nephites were granted immortality so that they could \\"bring the souls of men unto Jesus, while the world shall stand\\". The account in the Book of Mormon reads that they \\"did minister unto all the people, uniting as many to the church as would believe in their preaching; baptizing them, and as many as were baptized did receive the Holy Ghost.\\" Also similar to other stories about missionaries and martyrs, the text says that they suffered severe persecution from those who did not believe. Their longevity is referred to later by Mormon, who lived about four hundred years after the three Nephites in the Book of Mormon's timeline. He says \\"I have seen them, and they have ministered unto me.\\" Mormon also wrote that they will be among the Jews and the Gentiles, and the Jews and Gentiles \\"shall know them not.\\" \\"[And] when the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom that they shall minister unto all the scattered tribes of Israel, and unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, and shall bring out of them unto Jesus many souls.\\" Mormon states that he intended to write the names of the Three Nephites, but God forbade him to do so. The so-called Three Nephites are never called Nephites in the Book of Mormon text itself; they are referred to only as disciples, and it is possible that one or more of the them were Lamanites by descent.Cameron Staley, What we have been getting wrong about The Three Nephites, LDS Living. Note, though, that it was standard practice in the Book of Mormon to refer to Lamanites who were converted to the faith as Nephites. In modern Mormonism Three Nephite folklore has been studied by folklorists William A. Wilson, David Utter, Wayland Hand, Hector Lee, Austin E. and Alta S. Fife, and Richard Dorson.William A.

A railway gatekeeper's lodge was built circa 1867, and was later converted to the station master's cottage. It was later sold and converted to commercial use. Electric train services to Mount Druitt commenced in 1955, at a service presided by then Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill. In 1975, the railway station was relocated approximately 500 metres east to service a new shopping centre that was locally known as \\"The Great Western\\" and is now owned by Westfield. The old railway station was demolished almost immediately, although the level crossing remained until a road bridge carrying Carlisle Avenue over the railway line was completed. A footbridge was also built for pedestrians. Mount Druitt Hospital was opened in 1982 by Queen Elizabeth II. The 200-bed hospital was opened following significant fundraising and political agitation from the local community due to perception that the community was unable to access medical services at either Blacktown or Nepean Hospitals. In April 2006, the Attorney General's Department of New South Wales opened a new court house at a cost of A$12 million. This was to become the first metropolitan area courthouse to utilise \\"circle sentencing\\", with aims to reduce over representation of Indigenous Australians in custody. A local landmark is the Georgian cottage known as The Manse, situated in The Avenue. It was probably built by John Harris in the mid-1880s; the land on which it was built was originally part of Druitt's property. Later it was sold to Robert Kennedy. Kennedy left it to the Presbyterian Church when he died, and it was used for some time as a manse. It was acquired by Blacktown City Council in 2000 and restored. It is now the headquarters of the Mt Druitt Historical Society and is open to the public. It has both a local government and state government heritage listing.State Heritage Website  Heritage listings  Mount Druitt has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Great Western Highway: Neoblie * 23 The Avenue: The Manse Commercial area The Mount Druitt township was serviced by a relatively small shopping area known as Mount Druitt Village. In 1975, a new shopping centre, known locally as \\"The Great Western\\", was opened approximately 500 metres to the east when the railway station was also relocated and a large bus/rail interchange was built. The Westfield corporation took over the shopping centre, which is now known as Westfield Mount Druitt, located on the corner of Carlisle Avenue and Luxford Road, both major roads in the area. The complex has over 200 stores, ranging from discount department stores to specialty shops. Shopsmart is another shopping centre located in the suburb. Other services such as a hospital, coffee shops, small bars, council-operated swimming pool and library are all located within walking distance of the railway station. The area is under a Blacktown council redevelopment Plan. Much of the Housing commission has been sold off to Developers and the area is being revitalized - with Mixed use developments taking place. The area is becoming extremely popular with the Chinese, Thai and Filipino community. Due to the affordability, excellent schools, parks and transport links. Crime Mount Druitt has been one of the main hotspots for gangs and violent crime in Sydney in recent years. The suburb is known for its high rates of robbery, drugs offences and murder. Police figures for 2016-2017 included 562 incidents of violence and sexual offences and 641 incidents of antisocial behaviour. In this period, police abandoned more than 41 percent of cases as no culprit was identified. =Gun crime= Mount Druitt suffers from high rates of gun crime. In 2018, it had the highest rate of gun crime of any suburb in Sydney, with 87 individual reports of gunshots. Neighbouring Doonside witnessed a huge increase in shootings from around 2014, becoming the highest murder rated suburb in Sydney by 2016. This contributed to Mount Druitt's reputation as one of the most dangerous places in Sydney, as most perpetrators were associated or lived in Mount Druitt. In 2017, firearm offences rose by 7 per cent in Sydney, totalling 3,459 \\"gun-enabled\\" crimes, including 27 gun murders of which eleven victims were aged 18 or under. A series of gun crimes in Western Sydney, most notably Mount Druitt, Doonside and Blacktown, including the murders of four boys in one week, led some media commentators to call the region \\"gun capital\\". =Drug-related crime= Some neighbourhoods in Mount Druitt have become infamous for drug-dealing. For many years, Mount Druitt has been a stronghold for an organised crime ring known as the Honoured Society, who are rumoured to control more than 90% of Australia's heroin market. Transport Mount Druitt railway station is located on the North Shore & Western Line of the Sydney Trains network. There is an express service which runs all day taking 30 minutes to get to Parramatta and 55 minutes to Sydney. It features an interchange with bus routes operated by Busways with routes to all suburbs in the Mount Druitt area, Blacktown and Glendenning. The Council is embarking on a feasibility to install a new light rail which will link Mount Druitt to the other Blacktown Shire suburbs. Education Mount Druitt High school was established in the 1960s.Chifley College - Mount Druitt Campus - Celebrating 40 Years of Education The school is currently located within the suburb of Dharruk, adjacent to the local Emerton Shopping Village. It later rebranded as Chifley College Mount Druitt Campus, educating years 7–10. Chifley College Senior Campus educates the senior classes (years 11–12), and is within walking distance from Mount Druitt Station. A number of private schools such as the Church of England Grammar school have acquired parklands in the area. There are plans to build a 2000 student private school in the area adjacent to Wilmot. This is in partnership with the State Government who are selling off the failed public housing estate in the area.

It is a member of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT), an international network of Gelugpa dharma centers, and once served as its headquarters. The monastery was established by the FPMT's founders, Lamas Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, who bought the property from Nepal's royal astrologer in 1969. Its name comes from the name of the hill on which it was built. Kopan has become especially famous for teaching Buddhism to visiting Western foreigners. The first of what would become annual month-long (November–December) meditation courses was held in 1971. These courses generally combine traditional Lam Rim teachings with informal discussion, several periods of guided meditation, and a vegetarian diet. Kopan now encompasses two separate institutions: the monastery, atop Kopan Hill, and the nearby Khachoe Ghakyil Ling Nunnery (known as the Kopan Nunnery). The nunnery was established in 1979 by Lama Yeshe to provide spiritual and practical education modeled on that received by the monks. In 2009 the nunnery began raising money to expand its housing and education capacity, which has grown from 4 to 400 in less than 35 years, using such sites as GoFundMe. Kopan Monastery has also recently become a popular recreational destination for Kathmandu residents and tourists. On Saturdays it regularly receives hundreds of visitors from 10 AM to 4 PM.

He began playing music at an early age, starting with piano at age four, guitar at age ten, then learning both drums and bass guitar at 15. Attempts to find like-minded musicians in and around San Pedro became frustrating, and by 1982 Derrick began spending more time in Los Angeles, performing in various musical settings. In 1984 Derrick became roommates with Minutemen singer/guitarist D. Boon, and they began playing together informally with Crane, who played trumpet and sang on a few Minutemen records. The trio called themselves Cosmic Joke, but public performance was limited to two private parties. Derrick and Crane continued performing together, and in 1987, after several attempts with different musicians, they began working as a duo under the name Another Umbrella, which utilized extended delay guitar loops, pre-recorded instruments, slide shows, and a strong emphasis on improvisation. This went against the grain of what was popular in Los Angeles clubs at the time, but they did perform regularly around town and on radio, most notably at The Museum Of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles. Other musicians who performed with Another Umbrella include keyboardist Paul Roessler and flutist/vocalist Emily Hay. In 1997, two weeks after the final Another Umbrella show, Derrick began performing with drummer Bob Lee and a core of revolving musicians (including Nels Cline and Joe Baiza) under the name Solo Career, a side-project which lasted until 2002, performing whenever the musicians' schedules allowed. Between 1992 and 1994 Derrick produced concerts in Los Angeles for Canterbury Scene musicians Kevin Ayers, Richard Sinclair, Gilli Smyth and Tim Blake. In 1998 and 2000 Derrick organized and financed two California mini-tours with Ayers, eventually releasing the best of this material on the Alive In California CD through his own Box-O-Plenty Records. Derrick has also released the best of the home recordings with Boon as D. Boon and Friends, as well as the sole album by Solo Career, Season Finale, which features artwork by British artist Paul Whitehead (best known for his art on the Genesis albums Foxtrot, Trespass and Nursery Cryme). In 2005 Derrick began to experience symptoms of what was eventually diagnosed as Parkinson's disease, most likely as the result of head injuries sustained during an assault at a San Pedro record store in 1990. With most of the flexibility in his left-hand fingers now gone, he is unable to play guitar, bass or drums at his former level. As he was still able to play basic guitar chords, he joined several friends from the Los Angeles music scene to perform a tribute to Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett, which they called A Room Of Musical Tunes. A one-off performance in September 2006 was eventually followed by two performances in May 2007 and January 2009. In the summer of 2007, Derrick went through his entire recording archive and edited the highlights for posterity, ending up with 70 hours of music. The first of these recordings to be publicly available are seven hours of music (spread out over eleven albums) by Another Umbrella, released exclusively on digital downloads with no discs being pressed, in March 2008. Derrick remains active on the Los Angeles music scene, although on more of a behind-the-scenes level. Derrick closed down Box-O-Plenty Records in June 2011.

He was one of the Puritan leaders, and fought in the parliamentary army in the English Civil War. As a member of the high court of justice in 1649 he was 13th of 59 Commissioners to sign the death-warrant of King Charles I. Although he avoided the fate of some of the other regicides executed after the Restoration, he was exempted from the general pardon, only to the extent that he could not hold a public office. In 1663, he was accused of involvement in the Farnley Wood Plot, was incarcerated and died in prison. He invested very successfully in buying paintings from the art collection of Charles I after his execution, spending very large amounts relative to his wealth. After a few years he resold them for substantial profits.Brotton, Jerry, The Sale of the Late King's Goods: Charles I and His Art Collection, 2007, Pan Macmillan, - gives a detailed account, see the index Life Hutchinson was the son of Sir Thomas Hutchinson (1589–1643) of Owthorpe Hall and Margaret daughter of Sir John Byron of Newstead {she was a descendant of Sir William Sidney}. He was baptised on 18 September 1615. cites: Brown, Worthies of Notts, p. 190; Life of Col. Hutckinson, ed. 1885, i.57. He was educated at Nottingham Grammar School, Lincoln Free School where he considered John Clarke the Master 'a supercilious pedant',and Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1636 he entered Lincoln's Inn to study law, but devoted himself to music and divinity rather than the study of law. Unike his Royalist father, Sir Thomas Hutchinson, who represented Nottinghamshire in the Long parliament, he took, the parliamentary side. He first distinguished himself by preventing Lord Newark, the lord- lieutenant of the county, from seizing the county powder-magazine for the king's service. He next accepted a commission as lieutenant-colonel in the regiment raised by Colonel Francis Pierrepont, and became one of the parliamentary committee for Nottinghamshire. St Margaret's Church, Owthorpe Commemorative Plaque at St Margarets On 29 June 1643, at the order of the committee and of Sir John Meldrum, Hutchinson undertook the command of Nottingham Castle; he received from Lord Fairfax in the following November a commission to raise a foot regiment, and was finally appointed by Parliament governor of both town and castle. cites: Life, i. 224, 278. The town was unfortified, the garrison weak and ill-supplied, with the committee torn by political and personal feuds. The neighbouring royalist commanders, Hutchinson's cousin (Sir Richard Byron), and William, Marquess of Newcastle, attempted to corrupt Hutchinson. Newcastle's agent offered him £10,000, and promised that he should be made \\"the best lord in Nottinghamshire\\", but Hutchinson indignantly refused to entertain such proposals. cites: Life, i. 224, 234, 250, 369; Vicars, God's Ark, p. 104. The town was often attacked. Sir Charles Lucas entered it in January 1644 and endeavoured to set it on fire, and in April 1645 a party from Newark captured the fort at Trent- bridges. Hutchinson succeeded in making good these losses, and answered each new summons to surrender with a fresh defiance. cites: Life, i. 327, 383, ii. 70, 78. The difficulties were increased by continual disputes between Hutchinson and the committee, which were a natural result, in Nottingham as elsewhere, of the divided authority set up by Parliament. But there is evidence that Hutchinson was irritable, quick-tempered, and deficient in self- control. The Committee of Both Kingdoms endeavoured to end the quarrel by a compromise, which Hutchinson found great difficulty in persuading his opponents to accept. cites: Life, ii. 361. On 16 March 1646 Hutchinson was returned to Parliament as member for Nottinghamshire, succeeding to the seat held by his father, who had died on 18 August 1643. cites: Return of Names of Members, &c.; i. 492. His religious views led him to attach himself to the Independent rather than the Presbyterian party. As governor he had protected the separatists to the best of his ability, and now, under his wife's influence, he adopted the main tenet of the baptists. cites: Life, ii. 101. He was commissioner for exclusion from sacrament in 1646 and commissioner for scandalous offences in 1648. On 22 December 1648 Hutchinson signed the protest against the votes of the House of Commons accepting the concessions made by the king at the treaty of Newport, and consented to act as one of the judges at the trial of Charles I. cites: Walker, Hist. of Independency, ed. 1660, ii. 48. According to his wife, he was nominated to the latter post very much against his will; \\"but, looking upon himself as called hereunto, durst not refuse it, as holding himself obliged by the covenant of God and the public trust of his country reposed in him\\". cites: Life, ii. 152, 155. After serious consideration and prayer he signed the sentence against the king. From 13 February 1649 to 1651 Hutchinson was a member of the first two Councils of State of the Commonwealth, but he took no very active part in public affairs, and with the expulsion of the Long parliament in 1653 moved back to his family seat at Owthorpe near Nottingham and lived in retirement until 1659 when he was made High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire. His neighbours thought of electing him to the First Protectorate Parliament in 1656, but Major-general Whalley's influence induced them to change their minds. cites: (, iv. 299. According to his wife Lucy Hutchinson, Cromwell attempted to persuade her husband to accept office, \\"and, finding him too constant to be wrought upon to serve his tyranny\\", would have arrested him had not death prevented the fulfilment of his purpose. The certificate presented in Hutchinson's favour after the Restoration represents him as secretly serving the royalist cause during the Protectorate, but of this there is no independent evidence of this. The real object of his political action seems to have been the restoration of the Long parliament. He took his seat again in that assembly when the army recalled it to power (May 1659), and when John Lambert expelled it (October 1659) prepared to restore its authority by arms, he secretly raised men, and concerted with Francis Hacker and others to assist George Monck and Arthur Hesilrige against Lambert and his party, cites: Life, ii. 229, 234; Baker, Chronicle, ed. Phillips, p.691. In his place in parliament he opposed the intended oath abjuring the Stuarts, voted for the re-admission of the secluded members, and followed the lead of Monck and Cooper, cites: Life, ii. 236. in the belief that they were in favour of a Commonwealth. He retained sufficient popularity to be returned to the Convention Parliament as one of the members for Nottingham, but was expelled from it on 9 June 1660 as a regicide. On the same day he was made incapable of bearing any office or place of public trust in the kingdom, but it was agreed that he should not be excepted from the Act of Indemnity either for life or estate. cites: Commons' Journals, viii. 60. In his petitions he confessed himself \\"involved in so horrid a crime as merits no indulgence\\", but pleaded his early, real, and constant repentance, arising from \\"a thorough conviction\\" of his \\"former misled judgment and conscience\\", not from a regard for his own safety. cites: Life, ii. 392-8; Athenæum, 3 March 1860; Hist. MSS. Comm. 7th Rep. p. 120. Thanks to this submission, to the influence of his kinsmen, Lord Byron and Sir Allen Apsley, to the fact that he was not considered dangerous, and that he had to a certain extent forwarded the Restoration, Hutchinson escaped the fate of most of the other regicides. Yet, as his wife owns, \\"he was not very well satisfied in himself for accepting the deliverance. … While he saw others suffer, he suffered with them in his mind, and, had not his wife persuaded him, had offered himself a voluntary sacrifice\\". cites: Life, ii. 262. In October 1663 Hutchinson was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in what was known as the Farnley Wood Plot. The evidence against him was far from conclusive, but the government appears to have been eager to seize the opportunity of imprisoning him. cites: Life, ii. . pp. 292, 314; Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1663-4, pp. 314, 329, 391, 392. Imprisonment restored Hutchinson's peace of mind. He regarded it as freeing him from his former obligations to the government, and refused to purchase his release by fresh engagements. During his confinement in the Tower of London he was treated with great severity by the governor, Sir John Robinson, and threatened in return to publish an account of his malpractices and extortions. cites: Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1663-4 pp.539, 561. He even succeeded in getting printed a narrative of his own arrest and usage in the Tower, which is stated on the title-page to be \\"written by himself on the 6th of April 1664, having then received intimation that he was to be sent away to another prison, and therefore he thought fit to print this for the satisfying his relations and friends of his innocence\\". cites: Harl. Misc., ed. Park, iii. 33. A warrant for Hutchinson's transportation to the Isle of Man was prepared in April 1664, but he was finally transferred to Sandown Castle in Kent on 3 May 1664. The castle was ruinous and unhealthy, and he died of a fever four months after his removal to it on 11 September 1664. His wife obtained permission to bury his body at St Margaret's Church, Owthorpe. Assessment In the opinion of the historian C. H. Firth that Hutchinson's defence of Nottingham was a service of great value to the parliamentary cause, but his subsequent career in Parliament and the Council of State shows no sign of political ability. His fame rests on his wife (Lucy Hutchinson's) detailed biography of his life and commemoration of his character, not on his own achievements. Family He was married to Lucy, daughter of Sir Allen Apsley Lord Lieutenant of the Tower of London. John and Lucy had 9 children. His wife was the author of his biography Memoirs of the life of colonel Hutchinson. Although the book was not published until several years after her death, she had known many of the people in that conflict and was in an ideal position to chronicle the events of the war.

History Founded in 1854 as the New Danville Masonic Female Academy near Kilgore, Lon Morris College was the oldest existing two-year college in Texas until its closure in 2012. In 1873, the academy moved to Kilgore and became property of the Kilgore Methodist Church, changing its name to the Alexander Institute in honor of its president Isaac Alexander, an early Texas educator. The Texas Annual Conference acquired the Alexander Institute in 1875. Chartered on January 15, 1887, the Institute moved to Jacksonville in 1894 and to its final location in 1909. After R.A. \\"Lon\\" Morris of Pittsburg, Texas, gave his estate to the school, and with approval of the Texas Annual Conference, the name of the institution was changed again, in 1924, to Lon Morris College. When it closed, Lon Morris was the only two-year Methodist college west of the Mississippi River, and it had held membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools longer than any other two-year college in Texas. It was the only surviving pre-Civil War school in East Texas. One of Lon Morris' presidents was John E. Fellers, a Christian writer and Methodist minister, primarily in the Houston area, but also in Alexandria and Shreveport, Louisiana.John Andrew Prime, \\"Ex-pastor of First United Methodist dies\\", Shreveport Times, July 15, 2007 In 2009, the campus of Lon Morris grew to the west, with a gift from the city of Jacksonville of a municipal activity center (formerly a Texas National Guard armory), a rodeo arena, and land surrounding both. The college allowed annual events for the Tops-in-Texas Rodeo at the rodeo arena without any financial outlays from the city.City signs over recreation center, rodeo grounds , Jacksonville Daily Progress, August 10, 2009.

Later it transitioned to joint US/Israeli manufacture with Israeli Military Industries Advanced Systems Division (IMI-ASD). The Tactical Air Launched Decoy (TALD) was intended to confuse and saturate enemy air defenses, as part of an overall SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) strategy, thus allowing attacking aircraft and weapons a higher probability of penetrating to the target. The Improved TALD is a turbojet-powered version. History In the 1970s, the Brunswick Corp. developed several unpowered radar decoys, including the Samson, which was produced for the Israeli Air Force by Israel Military Industries (IMI) in the early 1980s. The Samson proved highly successful, prompting the US Navy to purchase about 2000 of them during the mid to late 1980s. The first units entered US service in 1987; in 1985, Brunswick was asked to develop an improved Samson named TALD. The TALD was an expendable glide vehicle with a square fuselage, flip-out wings, and three tail control surfaces. A digital flight control system could be programmed to conduct various speed or manoeuvering changes during flight. The missile could be launched from , at which height it had a range of up to ; a low-altitude range reduced this to . Variants ADM-141 TALDs being loaded onto Lt. Jeff Greer's A-7 Corsair II on 16 Jan 1991 Jeff Greer with the TALD he would drop on Night One The TALD was built in different versions. =ADM-141A= The ADM-141A has a passive and active radar enhancers. An IR addon was fielded for a while, but was later withdrawn from service. =ADM-141B= The ADM-141B carries a 36 kg (80 lb) payload of chaff. =ADM-141C= The ADM-141C (ITALD) has the same passive and active radar enhancers as the ADM-141A TALD. Operations The TALD was used with great success in the opening stages of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, with the first being deployed in combat by Lt. Jeff Greer. More than 100 were launched on the opening night of the war. This prompted the Iraqi air defense to activate many of its radars, most of which were then destroyed by anti- radiation missiles. The Improved TALD is powered by a Teledyne CAE Model 312 (J700-CA-400) turbojet. This boosted the range to more than at high altitude and at low altitude. This model was also capable of performing a flight profile resembling that of a real aircraft much more convincingly. Initially 20 TALDs were upgraded to ADM-141C ITALD configuration, with the first flight conducted in 1996. Since then the U.S. Navy has ordered over 200 ADM-141Cs. The major user of the ADM-141 is the F/A-18 Hornet. A single Hornet can carry up to 6 decoys.

Her feast day was celebrated on 8 October, originally in common with Saints Pelagia the Virgin and Pelagia of Tarsus.Greek Synaxarion. Pelagia died as a result of extreme asceticism, which had emaciated her to the point she could no longer be recognized. According to Orthodox tradition, she was buried in her cell. Upon the discovery that the renowned monk had been a woman, the holy fathers tried to keep it a secret, but the gossip spread and her relics drew pilgrims from as far off as Jericho and the Jordan valley. Legend Pelagia's story, attributed to James or Jacob (), deacon of the church of Heliopolis (modern Baalbek),. He states that Margarita was the \\"foremost actress\\" and a prominent harlot in Antioch.\\"Venerable Pelagia the Penitent\\", Orthodox Church in America During one of the city's church councils, she passed by on a donkey surrounded by her entourage and a \\"worldly crowd\\". Perfumed and \\"immodestly bareheaded\\", the outlines of her body were \\"clearly visible\\" beneath her gold cloth, pearls, and precious stones, which ran from her bare shoulders to her feet. Most of the fathers were shamed into looking away, but the bishop Nonnus stared openly and confessed himself \\"delighted\\". Mocking his fellows, he condemned both them and himself for taking less care of their souls than she had of her body. She appeared at his next Sunday sermon and Nonnus's sermon on hell and the goodness of paradise prompted her to repent. She had two of her slaves trail Nonnus to his residence and then wrote him on wax tablets, calling herself \\"sinful\\" and a \\"servant of the devil\\" but seeking mercy from God, who \\"came down to earth not for the sake of the righteous but to save sinners\\". Nonnus replied to the anonymous request that God knew her and her past and that he would receive her, but only in the presence of the other bishops. She went to the basilica of Saint Julian to see them; when Nonnus demanded surety that she would not return to her former life, she fell to the ground and threatened that if she were refused admission to the Church, all her future sins would be held against him at his judgment. The archbishop was informed and sent the deaconess Romana to clothe her in the baptismal gown. Nonnus took her confession and baptized \\"Margarita\\" under her birth name Pelagia, with Romana serving as her godmother. The devil shortly afterward arrived to complain, but was driven off when Pelagia made the Sign of the Cross and breathed upon him. He returned the next night to renew his complaints and was driven off the same way. On the third day, Pelagia directed her steward to inventory her possessions. She then turned them over to Nonnus, who disbursed them to the widows, orphans, and poor of the city. She freed her slaves, male and female, \\"taking their golden torcs off with her own hands\\". She then began living with Romana. The night before it came time to remove her baptismal gown, she stole out in the dark wearing one of Nonnus's chitons. She headed for Jerusalem, where she built a cell on the Mount of Olives. She lived there for three or four years, disguising herself as a male recluse and eunuch under the name Pelagi _us_. She then died, apparently as a result of extreme asceticism, which had emaciated her to the point she could no longer be recognized. According to Orthodox tradition, Pelagia was buried in her cell. Upon the discovery that the renowned monk had been a woman, the \\"holy fathers\\" tried to keep it a secret, but the gossip spread and her relics drew pilgrims from as far off as Jericho and the Jordan valley. The story appeared in the Greek Menaea. It significantly omits dates and (on eight occasions) the name of the archbishop under whom Nonnus served. History The historical St Pelagia, mentioned by St AmbroseAmbrose, De Virg., III, 7, 33.Ambrose, Ep. xxxvii. ad Simplic. and in two sermons by John Chrysostom,Chrysostom, Hom. in Matth. lxvii. was an Antiochene virgin who was martyred because of her refusal to offer pagan sacrifice during the Diocletianic Persecution. Chrysostom's sermon also mentions an anonymous (but apparently famous) actress and prostitute \\"from a wicked city in Phoenice\\" (possibly Heliopolis) who seduced \\"the empress's brother\\" but converted \\"in our own day\\". Constantius II's wife Eusebia had two brothers, Eusebius and Hypatius, joint consuls in 359, who both lived for many years in Antioch. In his account, attempts were made to lure her back to her former life by the Roman prefect and some of his soldiers, a role played by Satan in the hagiography. Saint Marina, the Latin equivalent of \\"Pelagia\\", was another bride who disguised herself as a monk, in her case to escape an unwanted marriage. Aspects of their stories were apparently combined with apocryphal accounts of Mary Magdalene, Biblical accounts of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba and of Jesus and various women in the New Testament,.

Lists of hashes are used for many different purposes, such as fast table lookup (hash tables) and distributed databases (distributed hash tables). A hash list with a top hash A hash list is an extension of the concept of hashing an item (for instance, a file). A hash list is a subtree of a Merkle tree. Root hash Often, an additional hash of the hash list itself (a top hash, also called root hash or master hash) is used. Before downloading a file on a p2p network, in most cases the top hash is acquired from a trusted source, for instance a friend or a web site that is known to have good recommendations of files to download. When the top hash is available, the hash list can be received from any non-trusted source, like any peer in the p2p network. Then the received hash list is checked against the trusted top hash, and if the hash list is damaged or fake, another hash list from another source will be tried until the program finds one that matches the top hash. In some systems (for example, BitTorrent), instead of a top hash the whole hash list is available on a web site in a small file. Such a \\"torrent file\\" contains a description, file names, a hash list and some additional data. Applications Hash lists can be used to protect any kind of data stored, handled and transferred in and between computers. An important use of hash lists is to make sure that data blocks received from other peers in a peer-to-peer network are received undamaged and unaltered, and to check that the other peers do not \\"lie\\" and send fake blocks. Usually a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 is used for the hashing. If the hash list only needs to protect against unintentional damage unsecured checksums such as CRCs can be used. Hash lists are better than a simple hash of the entire file since, in the case of a data block being damaged, this is noticed, and only the damaged block needs to be redownloaded. With only a hash of the file, many undamaged blocks would have to be redownloaded, and the file reconstructed and tested until the correct hash of the entire file is obtained. Hash lists also protect against nodes that try to sabotage by sending fake blocks, since in such a case the damaged block can be acquired from some other source.

Systems architects define the architecture of a computerized system (i.e., a system composed of software and hardware) in order to fulfill certain requirements. Such definitions include: a breakdown of the system into components, the component interactions and interfaces (including with the environment, especially the user), and the technologies and resources to be used in its design and implementation. The Systems Architect's work must avoid implementation issues and readily permit unanticipated extensions/modifications in future stages. Because of the extensive experience required for this, the Systems Architect is typically a very senior technologist with substantial, but general, knowledge of hardware, software, and similar systems. Above all, the systems architect must be reasonably knowledgeable of the users' domain of experience (that is, the architect of an air traffic system needs to be more than superficially familiar with all of the tasks of an air traffic system, including those of all levels of users).  Overview  Systems Architects interface with multiple stakeholders in an organization in order to understand the various levels of requirements, the domain, the viable technologies, and anticipated development process. Their work includes determining multiple design and implementation alternatives, assessing such alternatives based on all identified constraints (such as cost, schedule, space, power, safety, usability, reliability, maintainability, availability, and other \\"illities\\"), and selecting the most suitable options for further design. The output of such work sets the core properties of the system and those that are hardest to change later. In small systems the architecture is typically defined directly by the developers. However, in larger systems, a Systems Architect should be appointed to outline the overall system, and to interface between the users/sponsors (and other stakeholders) and the engineers. Very large, highly complex systems may include multiple architects, in which case the architects work together to integrate their subsystems or aspects, and respond to a Chief Architect responsible for the entire system. In general, the role of the architect is to act as a mediator between the users/sponsors and the engineers, reconciling the users' needs and requirements with what the engineers have determined to be doable within the given (engineering) constraints. In systems design, the architects (and engineers) are responsible for: * Interfacing with the user(s) and sponsor(s) and all other stakeholders in order to determine their (evolving) needs. * Generating the highest level of system requirements, based on the users' needs and other constraints. * Ensuring that this set of high level requirements is consistent, complete, correct, and operationally defined. * Performing cost–benefit analyses to determine whether requirements are best met by manual, software, or hardware functions; making maximum use of commercial off- the-shelf or already developed components. * Developing partitioning algorithms (and other processes) to allocate all present and foreseeable requirements into discrete partitions such that a minimum of communications is needed among partitions, and between the users and the system. * Partitioning large systems into (successive layers of) subsystems and components each of which can be handled by a single engineer or team of engineers or subordinate architect. * Interfacing with the design and implementation engineers and architects, so that any problems arising during design or implementation can be resolved in accordance with the fundamental design concepts, and users' needs and constraints. * Ensuring that a maximally robust and extensible design is developed. * Generating a set of acceptance test requirements, together with the designers, test engineers, and the users, which determine that all of the high-level requirements have been met, especially for the computer-human-interface. * Generating products such as sketches, models, an early user guide, and prototypes to keep the users and the engineers constantly up to date and in agreement on the system to be provided as it is evolving. * Ensuring that all architectural products and products with architectural input are maintained in the most current state and never allowed to seriously lag or become obsolete.  Systems architect: topics  Large systems architecture was developed as a way to handle systems too large for one person to conceive of, let alone design. Systems of this size are rapidly becoming the norm, so architectural approaches and architects are increasingly needed to solve the problems of large to very large systems. In general, increasingly large systems are reduced to 'human' proportions by a layering approach, where each layer is composed of a number of individually comprehensible sub-layers-- each having its own principal engineer and/or architect. A complete layer at one level will be shown as a functional 'component' of a higher layer (and may disappear altogether at the highest layers). = Users and sponsors = Architects are expected to understand human needs and develop humanly functional and aesthetically-pleasing products. A good architect is also the principal keeper of the users' vision of the end product, and of the process of deriving requirements from and implementing that vision. Architects do not follow exact procedures. They communicate with users/sponsors in a highly interactive, relatively informal way— together they extract the true requirements necessary for the designed (end) system. The architect must remain constantly in communication with the end users and with the (principal) systems engineers. Therefore, the architect must be intimately familiar with the users' environment and problem, and with the engineering environment(s) of likely solution spaces. = High level requirements = The user requirements specification should be a joint product of the users and architect: the users bring their needs and wish list, the architect brings knowledge of what is likely to prove doable within the cost, time and other constraints. When the users needs are translated into a set of high-level requirements is also the best time to write the first version of the acceptance test, which should, thereafter, be religiously kept up to date with the requirements. That way, the users will be absolutely clear about what they are getting. It is also a safeguard against untestable requirements, misunderstandings, and requirements creep. The development of the first level of engineering requirements is not a purely analytical exercise and should also involve both the architect and engineer. If any compromises are to be made— to meet constraints- the architect must ensure that the final product and overall look and feel do not stray very far from the users' intent. The engineer should focus on developing a design that optimizes the constraints but ensures a workable, reliable, extensible and robust product. The provision of needed services to the users is the true function of an engineered system. However, as systems become ever larger and more complex, and as their emphases move away from simple hardware and software components, the narrow application of traditional systems development principles have been found to be insufficient— the application of more general principles of systems, hardware, and software architecture to the design of (sub)systems is seen to be needed. Architecture may also be seen as a simplified model of the finished end product— its primary function is to define the parts and their relationships to each other so that the whole can be seen to be a consistent, complete, and correct representation of what the users' had in mind— especially for the computer-human-interface. It is also used to ensure that the parts fit together and relate in the desired way. It is necessary to distinguish between the architecture of the users' world and the engineered systems architecture. The former represents and addresses problems and solutions in the user's world. It is principally captured in the computer-human-interfaces (CHI) of the engineered system. The engineered system represents the engineering solutions— how the engineer proposes to develop and/or select and combine the components of the technical infrastructure to support the CHI. In the absence of an experienced architect, there is an unfortunate tendency to confuse the two architectures. But— the engineer thinks in terms of hardware and software and the technical solution space, whereas the users may be thinking in terms of solving a problem of getting people from point A to point B in a reasonable amount of time and with a reasonable expenditure of energy, or of getting needed information to customers and staff. A systems architect is expected to combine knowledge of both the architecture of the users' world and of (all potentially useful) engineering systems architectures. The former is a joint activity with the users; the latter is a joint activity with the engineers. The product is a set of high-level requirements reflecting the users' requirements which can be used by the engineers to develop systems design requirements. Because requirements evolve over the course of a project, especially a long one, an architect is needed until the system is accepted by the user: the architect ensures that all changes and interpretations made during the course of development do not compromise the users' viewpoint. = Cost/benefit analyses = Architects are generalists. They are not expected to be experts in any one technology but are expected to be knowledgeable of many technologies and able to judge their applicability to specific situations. They also apply their knowledge to practical situations, but evaluate the cost/benefits of various solutions using different technologies, for example, hardware versus software versus manual, and assure that the system as a whole performs according to the users' expectations. Many commercial-off-the-shelf or already developed hardware and software components may be selected independently according to constraints such as cost, response, throughput, etc. In some cases, the architect can already assemble the end system (almost) unaided. Or, s/he may still need the help of a hardware or software engineer to select components and to design and build any special purpose function. The architects (or engineers) may also enlist the aid of other specialists— in safety, security, communications, special purpose hardware, graphics, human factors, test and evaluation, quality control, reliability, maintainability, availability, interface management, etc. An effective systems architectural team must have access to specialists in critical specialties as needed. = Partitioning and layering = An architect planning a building works on the overall design, making sure it will be pleasing and useful to its inhabitants. While a single architect by himself may be enough to build a single-family house, many engineers may be needed, in addition, to solve the detailed problems that arise when a novel high-rise building is designed. If the job is large and complex enough, parts of the architecture may be designed as independent components. That is, if we are building a housing complex, we may have one architect for the complex, and one for each type of building, as part of an architectural team. Large automation systems also require an architect and much engineering talent. If the engineered system is large and complex enough, the systems architect may defer to a hardware architect and/or a software architect for parts of the job, although they all may be members of a joint architectural team. The architect should sub-allocate the system requirements to major components or subsystems that are within the scope of a single hardware or software engineer, or engineering manager and team. But the architect must never be viewed as an engineering supervisor. (If the item is sufficiently large and/or complex, the chief architect will sub-allocate portions to more specialized architects.) Ideally, each such component/subsystem is a sufficiently stand-alone object that it can be tested as a complete component, separate from the whole, using only a simple testbed to supply simulated inputs and record outputs. That is, it is not necessary to know how an air traffic control system works in order to design and build a data management subsystem for it. It is only necessary to know the constraints under which the subsystem will be expected to operate. A good architect ensures that the system, however complex, is built upon relatively simple and \\"clean\\" concepts for each (sub)system or layer and is easily understandable by everyone, especially the users, without special training. The architect will use a minimum of heuristics to ensure that each partition is well defined and clean of kludges, work-arounds, short-cuts, or confusing detail and exceptions. As users needs evolve, (once the system is fielded and in use), it is a lot easier subsequently to evolve a simple concept than one laden with exceptions, special cases, and much \\"fine print.\\" Layering the architecture is important for keeping the architecture sufficiently simple at each layer so that it remains comprehensible to a single mind. As layers are ascended, whole systems at lower layers become simple components at the higher layers, and may disappear altogether at the highest layers. = Acceptance test = The acceptance test is a principal responsibility of the systems architect. It is the chief means by which the program lead will prove to the users that the system is as originally planned and that all involved architects and engineers have met their objectives. = Communications with users and engineers = A building architect uses sketches, models, and drawings. An automation systems (or software or hardware) architect should use sketches, models, and prototypes to discuss different solutions and results with users, engineers, and other architects. An early, draft version of the users' manual is invaluable, especially in conjunction with a prototype. Nevertheless, it is important that a workable, well written set of requirements, or specification, be created which is reasonably understandable to the customer (so that they can properly sign off on it, but the principal users' requirements should be captured in a preliminary users' manual for intelligibility). But it must use precise and unambiguous language so that designers and other implementers are left in no doubt as to meanings or intentions. In particular, all requirements must be testable, and the initial draft of the test plan should be developed contemporaneously with the requirements. All stakeholders should sign off on the acceptance test descriptions, or equivalent, as the sole determinant of the satisfaction of the requirements, at the outset of the program. Architect metaphor The use of any form of the word 'architect' is regulated by 'title acts' in many states in the US, and a person must be licensed as a building architect to use it.The term \\"architect\\" is a professional title protected by law and restricted, in most of the world's jurisdictions, to those who are trained in the planning, design and supervision of the construction of buildings. In these jurisdictions, anyone who is not a licensed architect is prohibited from using this title in any way. In the State of New York, and in other US states, the unauthorized use of the title \\"architect\\" is a crime and is subject to criminal proceedings. In the UK the architects registration board excludes the usage of architect (when used in the context of software and IT) from its restricted usage.

History The area was originally known as Geegelup, which was believed to mean \\"place of gilgies\\" in the Noongar language, referring to the fresh water lobster that inhabits the area. However recent research suggests the actual meaning of Geegelup may be \\"place of spears\\". In 1852, A.C. Gregory made the original survey of the Geegelup area and in 1857, Edward Godfrey Hester (now honoured in nearby Hester) and John Blechynden settled there. In 1861, convicts built the road from Donnybrook into the area. In 1864 the Geegelup Post Office was established in a building on Blechynden’s property. A basic police station that had existed since c1862 was substantially reconstructed by former convict, Joseph Smith on the south bank of the Blackwood River in mid 1867. Mounted Constable Abraham W. Moulton was the first permanently appointed policeman.Bridgetown Historical Society The townsite was surveyed in April 1868 by Thomas Carey, who proposed the name Bridgetown for two reasons - \\"as it is at a bridge and the Bridgetown was the first ship to put in at Bunbury for the wool from these districts\\", and was approved and gazetted on 9 June 1868. From then until about 1885, many buildings including the primary school (1870), post office, new police station (1880) and two hotels were constructed, many of which are still standing today. In 1885, the Bridgetown Agricultural Society was formed and local farmers produced sheep, cattle, dairy products, timber, fruit and nuts. The building boom in Western Australia during the gold boom of the 1890s saw an increased demand for sawn timber, and numerous mills opened in the Bridgetown area. The coming of the railway in 1898 enabled quick access to markets for the many orchardists and helped establish the beginning of a tourist industry.Bridgetown Historical Society Until the 1980s, the land surrounding Bridgetown was almost exclusively used for broadacre agriculture and improved pasture. From the late 1970s, the area became increasingly attractive to tourists as a tranquil and picturesque country town an accessible distance from Perth. Some people, attracted by the areas's aesthetic qualities and rural lifestyle moved to the town permanently, which resulted in a strong demand for residential and hobby farm allotments, at a time when there was a coincident global downturn in agricultural markets. Many farmers sold up, and much of the most aesthetically pleasing land was subdivided and sold. The demographic change had a profound impact on the town's industry, replacing demand for farm services with demand for services in the tourism and recreation sectors. However, the dramatic increase in infrastructure such as housing, roads and power reticulation detracted from the rural aesthetic that attracted the influx in the first place. =Present day= Bridgetown is the seat of the Shire of Bridgetown-Greenbushes and the centre of a productive agricultural district. Many buildings in the town centre are over a century old. The town has a Jigsaw Gallery and Museum, which claims to host the only jigsaw collection of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, and also a primary school (1870) and high school (1962), district hospital, telecentre, shire offices, roadhouse, agricultural showground, shopping facilities, accommodation for travellers (hotel/motel, B&Bs;, caravan park) and numerous picnic spots along the Blackwood River. The rural residential area of Kangaroo Gully to the town's east has grown since the 1990s.

The manuscript The manuscript is now housed in the British Library, London (BL MS Cotton Vespasian D.8). As its name might suggest, though, it was once the property of the 17th-century antiquarian Sir Robert Bruce Cotton and was housed in his large library. Cotton's librarian, Richard James, quickly examined the manuscript and erroneously assumed that it contained the Biblical plays performed in Coventry during the 15th and 16th centuries, thus naming them the Ludus Coventriae or \\"the Play Called Corpus Christi\\". He was mistaken in both cases, but that mistake has proven very difficult to correct; the name Ludus Coventriae persists in the secondary and critical literature well into the 20th century. A further complication of the N-Town plays was made by Hardin Craig who, in his Medieval Drama (1955), called the collection the Hegge Plays after their former owner, Robert Hegge. The name Hegge Plays only briefly caught on, and the most common way to refer to these plays now is The N-Town Plays, after the reference in the last stanza of the opening proclamation that the play was to be played at \\"N-Town\\"; when the plays toured from town to town, N. (meaning nomen, the Latin for name) would be replaced by the name of the town the cycle was playing in at any given time. Adam and Eve are expelled from Paradise in 'The Fall of Man' from the N-Town plays, as performed by the Players of St Peter in St Clement Eastcheap,London in 2004 The plays of the N-Town cycle vary from simple, almost liturgical, recitations of Biblical texts (as in the Moses play of the Ten Commandments, the Jesse play with its kings and prophets, and the Pentecost play) to highly complex and fast moving short dramas on Biblical themes that have a naturalism and liveliness (as in the Death of Herod and the Woman Taken in Adultery) almost unique in early drama. These plays can all be played from a wagon or a single booth stage. On the other hand, the two Mary Plays and the Passion Play were written for what is often called \\"place and scaffold\\" production in the round using \\"scaffolds\\" or raised stages and also the \\"platea\\" or the \\"place\\" between the stages.Introduction to N-Town The true nature of the manuscript has been hidden by the fact that the scribe arranged all the episodes in \\"chronological order\\" starting with Creation and ending with Judgment, simulating an episodic play presenting salvation history as in the two northern civic cycles from York and Chester. As he did this he buried the Mary Play inside the Nativity sequence and copied the Passion Play into place between the Raising of Lazarus and the Resurrection appearances. It has taken painstaking paleographic and codicologic examinations of the manuscript to determine what the scribe actually did. To further complicate the matter, at some point in the history of copying out these plays, the proclamation was attached to them. Although the proclamation does not match the plays that follow, someone, possibly the scribe of this manuscript, placed numbers in the margin of the text against incidents that correspond to the description of the \\"pageants\\" in the proclamation. This does not affect the single episode pageants but it breaks up the flow of the Passion Play and has obscured the very existence of the Mary Play for centuries. A final scribal feature of this manuscript is the stage directions which reflect a curious mixture of intent. They seem to be recording performance detail while, at the same time, facilitating the reading of the manuscript as a meditation text rather than using it as a text to be enacted. The stage directions are in Latin in the pageants, in the Mary Play they are a mix of English and Latin and in the Passion Play they are almost entirely in English. They seem to function as much as an aid to help a reader visualise the action as actual practical instructions to a director. The details of costume and action in the stage directions in the Passion Play suggest a description of an actual performance. The liturgical music is specified in the Mary Play and Assumption Play by including the opening words of each piece or the \\"incipit\\" in the stage directions. On the other hand, the stage directions in many of the pageants are quite laconic. Location All scholars who have worked with this manuscript agree that it belongs in the east Midlands. Some attempt has been made to place it as far north as Lincoln (it was even called the Lincoln cycle by some scholars for a period and is still performed in the shadow of Lincoln Cathedral), but the general consensus places the manuscript in East Anglia. Stephen Spector cautiously writes \\"The linguistic evidence indicates that the codex was recorded principally or exclusively by scribes trained in East Anglia\\" (Spector, xxix)Spector, Stephen (ed). The N-Town Play. 2 vols. EETS S.S. 11–12, 1991; p. xxix Meredith more positively asserts that The Mary Play comes from Norfolk (Meredith, 6).Meredith, Peter (ed). The Mary Play (from N-Town). London, Longmans, 1987; p. 6 However, since the eclectic nature of the MS. has been recognised, scholars have been hesitant to insist that all the plays copied into this anthology were played in the same place. Date The date \\"1468\\" appears in the hand of the major scribe at the end of the Purification play (f 100v). This, then, is the earliest possible date for the copying of the text. Spector has concluded on the basis of dialectal evidence that the plays cannot predate 1425 and on the basis of the watermarks on the paper that the paper used by the main scribe comes from the period 1460–77. It is possible, again on the basis of the paper, that the Assumption play, written separately by a different scribe and bound into the main MS., was copied slightly earlier. We are safe to assume that the MS. dates from the second half of the third quarter (ca. 1463–75) of the 15th century. This makes it the oldest MS. to contain a large number of Biblical plays. Although we know there were plays performed elsewhere from the late 14th century, the York manuscript was written down in the 1470s, the Towneley MS. after the turn of the 16th century and all the versions of the Chester plays after 1596. Sources of the plays The majority of the plays that make up the N-Town Cycle are based (some rather tenuously) on the Bible, while the others are taken from Roman Catholic legend, apocryphal sources and folk tradition. The Parliament of Heaven is based on just one verse from a psalm. The Marian plays place a strong emphasis on the early life of the Virgin, as well as on the relationship between her and Joseph (which plays heavily upon the popular medieval old man with a younger wife trope). The Trial of Mary and Joseph play has been identified as a pastiche of the East Anglian ecclesiastical court system. *The Proclamation of the Banns *Play 1: Creation of Heaven & Fall of the Rebel Angels *Play 2: Creation of World & Fall of Adam and Eve *Play 3: Cain and Abel *Play 4: Noah's Flood *Play 5: Abraham's Sacrifice of Isaac *Play 6: Moses and the Ten Commandments *Play 7: The Root of Jesse: Prophecies of the Savior *Play 8: Joachim and Anna & the Conception of Mary *Play 9: Joachim and Anne's Presentation of Mary at the Temple *Play 10: The Marriage of Mary and Joseph *Play 11: The Parliament in Heaven and the Annunciation (the first part being a debate between the Four Daughters of God) *Play 12: Joseph's Doubt About Mary *Play 13: Mary's Visit to Elizabeth *Play 14: The Trial of Mary and Joseph *Play 15: The Nativity *Play 16: The Annunciation to and Visitation of the Shepherds *Play 17: (No play) *Play 18: The Adoration of the Magi *Play 19: The Purification *Play 20: Massacre of the Innocents *Play 21: Christ and the Doctors in the Temple *Play 22: The Baptism of Christ *Play 23: The Parliament in Hell and the Temptation in the Desert *Play 24: The Woman taken in adultery *Play 25: The Raising of Lazarus *Play 26: The First Passion Play: Lucifer and John the Baptist; Conspiracy Against Christ; Entry into Jerusalem *Play 27: The Last Supper *Play 28: Agony in the Garden & the Arrest of Christ *Play 29: Christ's Passion: Herod's Boasting; Trial Before Annas & Caiphas *Play 30: Death of Judas & Trials Before Pilate and Herod *Play 31: Pilate's Wife, and the Second Trial Before Pilate *Play 32: Procession to Calvary & Crucifixion of Christ *Play 33: The Harrowing of Hell *Play 34: Burial of Christ & Guarding of the Sepulchre *Play 35: The Harrowing of Hell, B; Christ's Appearance to Mary; Pilate Berates the Soldiers *Play 36: The Three Marys at the Tomb of Christ *Play 37: Christ's Appearance to Mary Magdalene *Play 38: Christ's Appearance to Cleophas, Luke, and Thomas *Play 39: The Ascension of Christ & the Selection of Matthias *Play 40: Pentecost *Play 41: Assumption of Mary Into Heaven *Play 42: Last Judgment Editions of the plays Some recent published editions of the N-town plays include: #The N-Town Play: Cotton MS Vespasian D. 8. 2 vols.

Early life and education Clement Ingleby was born at Edgbaston near Birmingham, the son of a lawyer. Poor health – he was not expected to live long – kept him from attending school, so he was privately educated at home. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, when twenty years old, and specialised in mathematics. He received his B.A. in 1847 and his M.A. in 1850. Returning to Birmingham he went to work in his father's law office, and then became a partner in the firm of Ingleby, Wragge, and Ingleby (now Wragge & Co LLP). In spite of his poor health he devoted his spare time to metaphysics, mathematics, and English literature. In 1850 Ingleby married Sarah Oakes (d. 3 January 1906). Class in logic In 1855 the Birmingham and Midland Institute was established, an experiment in continuing adult education. Ingleby took on giving a class in logic and metaphysics at the industrial branch. His methods were novel and the class was successful. A disciple of William Hamilton, Ingleby focused on the most current views, even obtaining from Hamilton his yet-unpublished improvements. Urged by his students, Ingleby issued Outlines of Theoretical Logic in 1856 as a textbook in the subject. It was his first published volume.  Collier Shakespeare controversy  In the 1850s documents discovered by John Payne Collier bearing on Elizabethan stage history in general and Shakespeare's life in particular fell under suspicion. Re-examination of several documents showed them to be out-and-out forgeries, forgeries so obvious it was difficult to see how Collier could have been deceived by them. One item of particular interest, the Perkins Folio, had never been examined by anybody besides Collier. It contained many corrections in what appeared to be a 16th-century hand that Collier suggested might be based on stage tradition. Ingleby, along with Sir Frederick Madden, who put the resources of the British Museum on the task, were finally able to examine the Perkins Folio in detail. They discovered—as was the case with others of the forgeries—modern pencil-marks under the supposedly ancient writing. The handwriting of these appeared to be Collier's. The conclusion was inescapable—Collier himself must have forged these documents. In 1859 Ingleby published a small volume entitled The Shakespeare Fabrications, setting these facts forth dispassionately. (An appendix to this volume dealing with the Ireland Shakespeare forgeries, however, was later repudiated by the author.) Collier denied the allegations, but Ingleby's A Complete View of the Shakespeare Controversy closed the discussion, and Collier did not reply.; Move to London Ingleby abandoned law for literature in 1859, and removed from Birmingham to the neighbourhood of London. His early works were of a philosophical nature (his Introduction to Metaphysics in two parts came out in 1864 and 1869), but he is best known as the author of a long series of works on Shakespearian subjects. In 1874 appeared The Still Lion, enlarged in 1875 as Shakespeare Hermeneutics. This warned against needless emendation of Shakespeare's text and explained some alleged problems. In 1875 Shakespeare's Centurie of Prayse came out, a definitive collection of allusions to Shakespeare and his works between 1592 and 1692. Other contributions include Shakespeare: the Man and the Book (a collection of essays in two volumes, 1877 and 1881), Shakespeare's Bones (1882), and Shakespeare and the Enclosure of the Common Fields at Welcombe (1885).; Other interests Ingleby was also a musician (he sang Shakespearean songs as part of the 1864 tercentenary celebration of Shakespeare's birth in Birmingham), a chess enthusiast who contributed problems to Chess Player's Chronicle and the Illustrated London News, and a member of the Athenæum Club. At various times he was Secretary of the Birmingham and Edgbaston Chess Club and a Vice-President of the Royal Society of Literature.; ; .

Mullewa is well known for an abundance of wildflowers in spring and it is one of the few places in Western Australia that the wreath flower grows. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.  History  European settlers moved to the area in 1869 to take up pastoral leases for farming. In 1894, the government built a narrow gauge railway from Geraldton to Mullewa and the town was gazetted in the same year. The town is named for Mullewa Spring, based on an Aboriginal name recorded by surveyor John Forrest in 1873. The meaning of the name is not certain, but the most accepted meaning is \\"place of fog\\". Church of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel and the Holy Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul and Priesthouse The architect priest Mgr John Hawes built the Church mainly with his own hands and the help of parishioners. Work started in 1921 and the stone and tile church was completed, after some interruptions, in 1927. The eclectic design of the Church shows some influence of Spanish Mission style. Hawes built a presbytery for himself next to the church and this, known as the Priesthouse, was finished in 1929: it’s been used as a museum since 1980.

The island is formed by the Danube River splitting into two branches passing north and south of it. The international frontier between Bulgaria and Romania follows the north branch of the river and therefore Belene Island is part of the Bulgarian territory. The island is long and reaching in width; it is located in the Danube, north of the town of Belene. Belene Island is the fourth biggest Danube island: during an average tide it is in area. During a high tide, parts of the island are submerged. The island is connected to the town of Belene with a pontoon bridge. Belene Island is a part of the Belene Islands Complex and of the Persina Natural Park, a home to over 170 species of rare water birds, such as the glossy ibis, pygmy cormorant, lesser grey shrike, red-breasted goose and others. The flora of Belene Island is represented by willows, poplars and aspens; there is some arable land. The island was formed of alluvial sediments. The island is infamous for the Belene concentration camp that functioned there for detention of political prisoners between 1949–1953 and 1956–1959. The Belene Prison is still operating as a penitentiary in the western part of the island, while the eastern part is a managed natural reserve.

It features exhibits and displays, historic spacecraft and memorabilia, shows, two IMAX theaters, and a range of bus tours of the spaceport. The \\"Space Shuttle Atlantis\\" exhibit contains the Atlantis orbiter and the Shuttle Launch Experience, a simulated ride into space. The center also provides astronaut training experiences, including a multi-axial chair and Mars Base simulator.https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/landing- pages/atx The visitor complex also has daily presentations from a veteran NASA astronaut. A bus tour, included with admission, encompasses the separate Apollo/Saturn V Center. There were 1.7 million visitors to the visitor complex in 2016. History A small trailer served as the Visitors Information Center in the early 1960s The complex had its beginning in 1963 when NASA Administrator James Webb 1960s established self-guided tours the public could drive along a predetermined route through the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and a small trailer containing simple displays on card tables. An estimated 100,000 visitors went through that first year. As the American space program's popularity grew with the Mercury Program and Alan Shepard's historic launch, large numbers of press and public flocked to the Cape Canaveral area to get a close up view. Webb was urged by U.S. Rep. Olin Teague of Texas to create a visitors' program. By 1964, more than 250,000 self-guided car tours, permitted between 1 and 4 pm. ET on Sundays, were seen at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). alt=In 1965, KSC Director Kurt H. Debus was authorized to spend $2 million on a full-scale visitor center, covering 42 acres. Spaceport USA, as it was soon titled, hosted 500,000 visitors in 1967, its first year, and one million by 1969. Ten-thousand visitors toured the center on December 24, 1968, following the Apollo 8 orbit of the Moon. alt= Beginning July 22, 1966, public tours were offered on 40-passenger busses. Operated by TWA, a 1.5-hour tour that included the Vehicle Assemble Building and a 3-hour tour including launch facilities were available. Tickets ranged from $0.50 for children 12 and under to $2.50 for adults for the longer tour. More than 1,500 people toured that first day and additional busses were quickly added to the fleet of former Greyhound busses. TWA continued operating tours through at least the bicentennial celebrations in 1976. Visitor Information Complex, 1969 As NASA neared the Moon, popularity grew. By 1969, the visitor center was the second most visited Florida attraction, behind Tampa's Busch Gardens. Even during the gap between the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs, attendance remained at over one million guests and it ranked as the fifth most popular tourist attraction in Florida. When nearby Walt Disney World opened in 1971, visitor center attendance increased by 30%, but the public was often disappointed by the comparative lack of polish at KSC's tourist facilities. Existing displays were largely made up of trade show exhibits donated by NASA contractors. Later that year, a $2.3 million upgrade of the visitor complex began with added focus on the benefits of space exploration along with the existing focus on human space exploration. Visitor Complex in 1998 In 1995, Delaware North Companies was selected to operate the visitor center. Between 1995 and 2007, the visitors center went through many changes, including the improvement of restaurants, retail shops, buses, and new exhibits. It is also when the visitor complex got its current name, Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. Since then, the facility has been entirely self-supporting and receives no taxpayer or government funding. Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex was voted the 8th best museum in the United States by Trip Advisor in 2016. NASA renewed the contract with Delaware North Companies through 2028. Attractions Entrance to Kennedy Space Center, the John F. Kennedy memorial and a Space Shuttle stack in the background Space Shuttle Atlantis Exhibit building Included in the base admission is tour-bus transportation to Launch Complex 39 and the surrounding KSC property, and the Apollo/Saturn V Center. Previously, it used to include admission to the Astronaut Hall of Fame, to the west. That building is now closed and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame resides in a new exhibit at the visitor complex, Heroes & Legends. The Apollo/Saturn V Center, located north inside NASA's gates, is a large museum built around its centerpiece exhibit, a restored Saturn V launch vehicle, and features other space related exhibits, including an Apollo capsule. Two theaters allow the visitor to relive parts of the Apollo program. One simulates the environment inside an Apollo firing room during an Apollo launch, and another simulates the Apollo 11 Moon landing. The tour formerly included the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) where modules for the International Space Station were tested.Mercury Control consoles in Heroes & Legends. The Visitor Complex includes two facilities run by the Astronauts Memorial Foundation. The most visible of these is the Space Mirror Memorial, also known as the Astronaut Memorial, a huge black granite mirror through-engraved with the names of all astronauts who died in the line of duty. Elsewhere on the Visitor Complex grounds is the foundation's Center for Space Education, which includes a resource center for teachers, among other facilities; and the Kurt Debus Conference Center. Heroes & Legends, which replaced the previous Early Space Exploration exhibit, houses the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame and several displays of artifacts. Among them is the Gemini 9A spacecraft, as well as a recreation of the Mercury Control Center using consoles and furniture relocated from the original building at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. These were previously housed in the Mercury Mission Control facility, which was on the National Register of Historic Places, but it was demolished in May 2010 due to concerns about asbestos and the estimated $5-million cost to renovate the building after 40 years of exposure to salt air.Mercury Control building Atlantis display =Space Shuttle Atlantis= main engines, Orbital Maneuvering System, and Reaction Control System on display in 2016alt= In 2010, the center announced a $100 million plan to house a retired Space Shuttle orbiter in a 10-story facility. On April 12, 2011, the 30th anniversary of the launch of STS-1, NASA announced that Space Shuttle Atlantis would be provided to the visitors center for display after its last flight on STS-135 and subsequent decommissioning. The exhibit officially opened on June 29, 2013, offering a nearly 360-degree view of the shuttle. Atlantis is positioned at a 43.21 degrees angle with the payload bay doors open; a view only previously seen in space. The exhibit also includes a life sized replica of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Shuttle program's astrovan, Dr. Maxime Faget’s Shuttle prototype from 1969, a large-scale slide mimicking the 22 degree slope of a Space Shuttle when landing, numerous astronaut training and Shuttle simulators, and other displays about life in space. On the ground level is the \\"Forever Remembered\\" exhibit, commemorating the 14 astronauts lost in both Space Shuttle Challenger and Space Shuttle Columbia disasters. Forever Remembered includes personal artifacts from the astronauts, two recovered pieces of the Shuttles, footage of the physical and emotional recovery, and the return to flight. This exhibit replaced the Space Shuttle Explorer which was a full-scale, high-fidelity replica of the Space Shuttle which visitors were able to board. Explorer was removed from the KSC Visitor Center on December 11, 2011, and relocated to the Vehicle Assembly Building's turn basin dock adjacent to the Launch Complex 39 Press Site. The vehicle remained at the turn basin until 2012, when it was moved to the Space Center Houston. =Shuttle Launch Experience= The Space Shuttle Launch Simulation Facility building exterior The Shuttle Launch Experience, designed by Bob Rogers and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, opened May 25, 2007. The attraction puts guests through a simulated Shuttle launch. Delaware North Companies invested six years and $60 million into the attraction. Astronauts, NASA experts and attraction-industry leaders were consulted during development. The attraction is housed in a building that holds four simulators, each accommodating 44 people. Former Shuttle commander and then NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden narrates the simulation and hosts the prerecorded pre-show. In the attraction's early years, guests would enter from the outside and exit into a gift shop before heading back out to the Visitor Complex. In 2013, however, the attraction was later made part of the exhibit for the Space Shuttle Atlantis, with the former gift shop space being used for several simulators that allowed guests to try their hand at landing and docking the Space Shuttle. = Heroes & Legends = The Gemini 9A space capsule, flown in 1966 by Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene Cernan Sigma 7, flown in 1962 by Wally Schirra and shown on display in 2007, is now exhibited at Heroes & Legends The United States Astronaut Hall of Fame is now located in Heroes & Legends, which replaced the previous Early Space Exploration exhibit inside the visitor complex's main entrance. The $20 million exhibit, which opened in 2016, focuses on America's first astronauts and nine characteristics of a hero. Each characteristic features astronaut artifacts and multimedia relevant to that characteristic. Key artifacts include the 1966 Gemini 9A capsule flown by Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene Cernan, the original NASA emblem from the Mercury Control Center (1959), the control center from Project Mercury (remaining from Early Space Exploration), Mercury Redstone Rocket MR-6 (likely intended for Deke Slayton), and Wally Schirra's 1962 Sigma 7 capsule. There are also artifacts from specific astronauts, such as Gus Grissom’s suborbital flight suit from July 21, 1961. Heroes & Legends also holds the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame, displaying the inducted men and women. In the center of the hall is an interactive kiosk with an inductee database, a mission index, and a virtual photo opportunity with the Mercury 7 astronauts. The Boeing Company is the title sponsor of Heroes & Legends, which marked the first time the visitor complex entered an agreement with a corporate sponsor in more than 50 years. U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame The United States Astronaut Hall of Fame, located inside the Heroes & Legends building, is included with visitor complex daily admission. The Hall of Fame was previously owned and operated by the U.S. Space Camp Foundation, but was purchased at auction by Delaware North Park Services in September 2002 on behalf of NASA. The building was renamed the ATX Center and houses educational programs including Camp Kennedy Space Center and the Astronaut Training Experience. =Rocket Garden= The Rocket Garden is located inside the front entrance, beyond Heroes & Legends.It is an outdoor display of historic rockets that put Americans and satellites in space. Visitors can walk up to and around the base of the rockets. All of the rockets in the garden are legitimate rockets with the exception of the Mercury-Atlas, which is a re-creation replica. The Mercury-Redstone, Mercury-Atlas, and Titan II rockets launched astronauts and the Juno I, Juno II, Thor-Delta, and Atlas-Agena rockets launched satellites from Cape Canaveral. These are mounted upright whereas the largest rocket, a Saturn IB, is mounted on its side. Saturn IB rockets launched Apollo Command/Service Modules into Earth orbit for Apollo, Skylab, and the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project. The Saturn IB is being restored in 2018.Collect Space The Juno I on display is painted with serial number \\"UE\\", a reference to the vehicle that launched the first US satellite, Explorer I. A Juno II launched the first American probe to escape Earth's gravity and fly past the Moon. Atlas-Agena rockets launched early probes to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, as well as the Agena target vehicles used in rendezvous and docking by Gemini spacecraft—a necessary technique for the following Apollo missions. The Thor- Delta was one of the most reliable and frequently used launch vehicles. The Titan II on display is a refurbished Air Force ICBM with a replica Gemini spacecraft, painted to resemble the Gemini 3 booster. It was rescued from the Arizona Boneyard and erected in 2010 to replace a deteriorating mockup composed of two first stages which had been on display for more than 20 years.Pearlman, Robert Z. \\"Gemini-Titan Rocket Rises Again at Kennedy Space Center\\" (September 24, 2010) space.com Retrieved September 25, 2010 The Saturn IB on display is SA-209 which was designated for a possible Skylab Rescue mission. The garden also features mock-ups of capsules from the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs that visitors can get in. An F-1 rocket engine that powered the first stage of the Saturn V is also on display. Free guided tours of the garden are available daily. In June 2019, visitor complex official Therrin Protze offered placement of a Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy booster in the garden to SpaceX: \\"We have the space available and the capability to make it happen.\\" SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk responded expressing interest in the offer.

The Apollo/Saturn V Center is located north-northwest of Launch Complex 39 on the Kennedy Parkway N near the Shuttle Landing Facility and is only accessible to visitors by bus tours from the Visitors Complex. The center, which opened December 17, 1996, was designed by Bob Rogers and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, for NASA and Delaware North Companies. The opening of the exhibit was historic for NASA as it was the first large exhibit to be opened inside a restricted area, only accessible by Kennedy Space Center tour buses. The 100,000-square-foot facility was built to house a restored Saturn V launch vehicle and features other exhibits related to the Apollo program. Until the structure was built, the Saturn V was displayed horizontally for many years outdoors just south of the Vehicle Assembly Building and tour buses brought visitors to it. Other exhibits include the Apollo 14 command module Kitty Hawk, which carried Alan Shepard, Stuart Roosa, and Edgar Mitchell to the Moon in 1971 and orbited it 34 times, during which Shepard and Mitchell made the third crewed lunar landing;NASA Apollo 14 page an unused Apollo command and service module Skylab Rescue (CSM-119), and an unused Lunar Module (LM-9). CSM-119 was designated for a possible Skylab rescue mission and as a backup for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project. LM-9 was originally scheduled to be used on Apollo 15, but when missions after Apollo 17 were canceled, a later LM (LM-10) was used instead. Also on display is a slice of Moon rock that visitors can touch. Other exhibits include a replica of the Lunar Roving Vehicle, a variety of space suits including Alan Shepard's Apollo 14 extravehicular suit, a piece of Apollo 13's Lunar Module returned by the astronauts, lunar samples from Apollo 15 and Apollo 17, and a large cut-away scale model of the Saturn V. Two theaters allow visitors to relive parts of the Apollo program – one simulates the environment inside an Apollo-era firing room during the launch of Apollo 8 and the other simulates the Apollo 11 landing. In January 2017, \\"Ad Astra Per Aspera – A Rough Road Leads to the Stars\\" opened in the Apollo/Saturn V Center to commemorate the fallen astronauts of Apollo 1. The permanent tribute showcases personal memorabilia from the three astronauts, with photos and video from their professional and personal lives. The exhibit also displays the charred three-section Block I hatch from the fire, and a redesigned Block II hatch. The Block II hatch flew on all following Apollo missions that could open quicker in the event of an emergency.

It is now known as Journey to Mars: Explorers Wanted with a focus on Mars exploration. The attraction, which employs large-scale video projections, dimensional exhibits and interactive experiences, is designed to immerse visitors into the adventure and unsolved challenges of future space exploration. The exhibit includes orbital docketing and lunar landing simulators, a full-sized development model of a crew vehicle, a model of a space exploration vehicle, and models of the Mars rover family: Curiosity, Spirit, Opportunity, and Sojourner. = NASA Now = NASA Now is an exhibit that has a revolving display of spacecraft from NASA and its commercial partners. NASA Now, as of summer 2017, has the space-flown Orion EFT-1 designed for NASA's future Space Launch System (SLS) and a scale model of an SLS rocket. There is also a full- scale model of the crew vehicle CST-100 Starliner by Boeing. SpaceX’s space- flown COTS-2 Dragon capsule, which is the first commercial vehicle to dock with the International Space Station, is also featured. A pressure vessel for CST-100 Starliner, a scale model of the Dream Chaser cargo vehicle from Sierra Nevada Corporation, a scale model of United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket, and a Vector-R rocket from Vector Space Systems are also all in the exhibit. NASA Now is located inside the IMAX theater. =Space Mirror Memorial= The Space Mirror Memorial, also known as the Astronaut Memorial, is maintained by the Astronauts Memorial Foundation and is located behind the IMAX theater on the grounds of the main Visitor Complex. It honors NASA astronauts along with several military and civilian astronauts who have died in the line of duty. = Robot Scouts (closed) = In 1999, the attraction \\"Robot Scouts\\" opened as a walk-through exhibit highlighting NASA's unmanned planetary robot probes. The attraction, designed originally by award-winning experience designer Bob Rogers (designer) and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, explores how robots help to pave the way for human spaceflight. During their visit, guests were guided through the attraction by a robot named StarQuester 2000, who explained to them the mission of the \\"Robot Scouts: Trailblazers for Human Exploration\\", with the help of the other then-active robots, including the Voyagers, the Vikings, Cassini, and even the Hubble Space Telescope. The experience culminated in a visit to a diorama of a Mars base, which even included a simulated Martian sunset. The attraction is now closed, and replaced by a new more enhanced and activity-packed scout program.https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/groups#Scouts = Early Space Exploration (closed) = In 1996, \\"Early Space Exploration\\" opened as an exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center in the far corner of the Rocket Garden near where the Visitor Complex's current entrance is now. As its name suggests, this exhibit celebrates the early years of American space exploration, with TVs displaying news broadcasts from the 1960s that described the events of certain flights as well as other memorabilia commemorating the time. The exhibit also featured the actual consoles from the Mercury Mission Control Center. This exhibit was closed in 2014 and transformed into Heroes & Legends, with many of the items from the original Astronaut Hall of Fame relocated to here. The Mercury Mission Control Consoles were also kept from the aforementioned exhibit. Special events and programs The Visitors Complex also hosts special ticketed events run by Delaware North. Naturalization ceremonies have been conducted in the Rocket Garden. Space shuttle launch viewing was offered and now rocket launch viewing, from the visitor complex, offering close views of the launch pads. The U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame hosts a yearly induction ceremony. The Astronaut Training Experience is also offered by Delaware North at the Astronaut Training Experience Center with several full-sized mock-ups of the space shuttle, Mission Control and training hardware. The complex also runs week-long accredited day camps for children in grades 2–9. The visitor complex offers events all year, ranging from astronaut presentations and signing opportunities, special guest appearances, and anniversary celebrations.

He was declared emperor by the legions stationed in Mesopotamia when they rebelled, due to the invasion of the Sassanids in 229AD. His revolt was swiftly crushed by Alexander, in late summer of 232AD, and he drowned in the Euphrates while attempting to flee to Sassanid territory. History In 229AD, during the reign of Emperor Severus Alexander, the Sassanids invaded Mesopotamia. This led to a rebellion, in 232AD, by the provincial garrison. During this rebellion, Flavius Heracleo was killed, and the legion proclaimed Taurinius emperor. In the late summer of 232AD, Alexander arrived to crush the revolt. Taurinius fled, and drowned while attempting to cross the Euphrates into Sassanid territory. Historiography The Epitome de Caesaribus refers to him as Taurinius, and says that he revolted against Emperor Severus Alexander, and was declared augustus. He is said to have thrown himself into the Euphrates on account of fear of Severus Alexander. It is noted that this is the only mention of any event during Alexander's reign made by the Epitome de Caesaribus. Zonaras makes similar mention of him, but refers to him as Taurinus. Taurinius never controlled a mint, so no numismatic evidence of his revolt remains. Although mentioned in the Epitome de Caesaribus, Taurinius is noticeably absent from Aurelius Victors De Caesaribus, and Eutropiuss Breviarium historiae Romanae, and is not found in any other literary or epigraphic evidence.

Their distribution stretches from south Texas through Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to Nicaragua and Costa Rica. R. dorsalis mostly commonly inhabits the subtropical and tropical dry forests within its range characterized by wet and dry seasons, but may also be found during periods of heavy rain in pastures, cultivated field, roadside ditches or other open areas. The family was once more widespread, including species ranging as far north as Canada, but these died out in the Oligocene. Its name means 'nose- toad', from rhino- (), the combining form of the Ancient Greek ' (, 'nose') and ' (, 'toad'). R. dorsalis for the majority of the year can be found in burrows beneath the surface (fossorial), whose physiology reflects the adaptation to this underground environment. Description Burrowing Toad (Rhinophrynus dorsalis), Municipality of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico (8 October 2007). Adults of the Mexican burrowing toad grow to be between 75-85 mm (snout-vent length) or about 3.0 to 3.3 inches. R. dorsalis are sexually dimorphic, with females being larger than males. It is characterized by a short, stout, globular-shaped body and conical-shaped head. The color of its smooth skin ranges from shades of dark-gray to maroon-brown on its top surface, which is covered in irregular spots of pale yellow, orange, and red markings and has a red stripe along the center of its back. Keratinized spades on the inside of each hind foot aid it in digging. The snout is covered in epidermal armor of small keratinous spines and the lips are doubled sealed by secretions from submandibular glands. Its eyes are relatively small, and the tympanum is not visible. Unique among the frogs, the Mexican burrowing toad's tongue is projected directly out the front of the mouth, instead of being flipped out, as in all other frogs as a specialization for eating subterranean arthropods, primarily ants and termites. Ecology and behavior R. dorsalis are considered “explosive breeders”, also characteristic of other burrowing Anura, whereby many individuals exit their burrows synchronously and converge upon temporary pools of water. For the majority of the year, R. dorsalis lives underground and only emerges with the first heavy rains of the year. The males then float on the surface of the water, partially submerged, and inflate their bodies while calling that will eventually result in most males mating with females using inguinal amplexus. Although the mating season of explosive breeders is restricted to a short period each year, R. dorsalis has one of the shortest seasons among amphibians of between 1-3 days, after which they will burrow back into the ground once the environment has dried up and remain until the next breeding season. Intraspecific competition between males for females rarely involves agonistic interactions, but instead relies on acoustic communication. Females of R. dorsalis are thought to choose mates based on characteristics of their mating calls, also referred to as advertisement calls. These calls last 1.36 (± 0.12) seconds and are characterized by a single tone that is upward modulated. This call sounds like a loud, low- pitched \\"wh-o-o-o-a\\". Preceding the advertisement call are another type of vocalization known as pre-advertisement marked by a single sound only 0.25 (± 0.09) seconds that instead do not modulate. As a newly documented call, the function of this vocalization type is currently unknown but is thought to play a role in aggression or act as a close-range signal for other males. When the female is laying eggs, both male and female are underwater. Between 6-12 eggs come out of her cloaca successively, whose sticky surfaces will clump together on the bottom surface. The eggs take only a few days to hatch, and the tadpoles develop over one to three months. Evolutionary independence The Mexican burrowing toad is genetically unique in a number of ways. According to EDGE, Mexican burrowing toads are: > The only species, within the only genus of the family Rhinophrynidae, and > with over 190 million years of independent evolution, the Mexican burrowing > toad is the most evolutionarily distinct amphibian species on Earth today; a > fruit bat, polar bear, killer whale, kangaroo and human are all more similar > to one another than this species is to any other amphibian.

He played first-class cricket for eight years between 1881 and 1888, for Oxford University, Middlesex and England. Life He was the son of Henry David Leslie and his wife, Mary Betsy Perry. At Rugby School he was captain of cricket, and according to one opinion was, with Charles Thomas Studd of Eton, the best public school all-rounder of the year. He was compared favourably to Manley Kemp, cricket captain of Harrow School. Leslie matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, in 1880.s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Leslie, Charles Frederick Henry He became managing director of William France, Fenwick &. Co. Ltd., Fenchurch Street, London, coal merchants and ship owners, a company formed in 1901 when three shipping companies merged. They shipped mainly coal, and Baltic timber. As a director of Baku Russian Petroleum, he visited Baku in 1904, and struck up a friendship with the entrepreneur Leslie Urquhart. After the 1905 Russian Revolution and subsequent depression, Leslie went into business with Urquhart, investing in Russian oil and minerals. At board level, the existing Anglo- Siberian group was reconfigured as the Perm Corporation, including Sir Frederick Frankland of East Russian mines and the civil engineer Thomas Blair Reynolds (1860–1941), as well as Leslie and Urquhart. In 1908 Leslie became Chairman of the Kyshtym Corporation, for mining, with Semmy Joseph Blumlein (1863–1914) as managing director. By 1912, in a complex corporate struggle, Leslie had broken with Urquhart. The Fenchurch group of investors were excluded from further developments by Urquhart, who had joined forces with American interests, for whom Alfred Chester Beatty and Herbert Hoover were acting. By 1905, Leslie resided at Epcombs, near Hertingfordbury in Hertfordshire.'Parishes: Hertingfordbury', in A History of the County of Hertford: Volume 3, ed. William Page (London, 1912), pp. 462–468. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/herts/vol3/pp462-468 [accessed 2 April 2018]. =Cricketing career= Leslie was a hard-hitting batsman with a solid defence, a useful right-arm fast bowler and an athletic cover-point. He won blues for cricket in each of his three seasons at Oxford (1881–83) and also at racquets and football. His performances won him selection for the Honourable Ivo Bligh's tour side to Australia in 1882/3 where he was part of the team that regained the Ashes. His Test career comprised all four matches for Bligh's team when he scored 106 runs at 15.14 and took four wickets at 11.00. The first three matches were played against Billy Murdoch's 1882 touring team and counted for the Ashes; Leslie did not take a wicket in the last two of those Tests. The urn was not at stake for the fourth match played against a combined Australian side when Leslie took one first innings wicket. Leslie represented Middlesex from 1881 to 1886 and in 48 first-class matches in total scored 1860 runs at 22.96 with his 144 for Bligh's XI against New South Wales the highest of his four hundreds. He took eight wickets at 20.62 and held 18 catches. Below first-class level Leslie played county level cricket for Shropshire between 1878 and 1891, achieving a century in one match where he made 164 runs. He played during that time at club level for Oswestry.Published under Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. Family His son, John, also played first-class cricket.

It is contained in the Suttavibhaṅga, a division of the Vinaya Piṭaka.  Pārājika  The four pārājikas (lit. \\"defeats\\") are rules entailing expulsion from the sangha for life. If a monk breaks any one of the rules he is automatically \\"defeated\\" in the holy life and falls from monkhood immediately. He is not allowed to become a monk again in his lifetime. Intention is necessary in all these four cases to constitute an offence. The four parajikas for bhikkus are: # Sexual intercourse: engaging in any sexual intercourse. # Stealing: the robbery of anything worth more than 1/24 troy ounce of gold (as determined by local law). # Intentionally bringing about the death of a human being — whether by killing the person, arranging for an assassin to kill the person, inciting the person to die, or describing the advantages of death.From Buddhist Monastic Code 1, Chapter 4: Parajika. Copyright © 1994, 2007 Thanissaro Bhikkhu Access to Insight edition © 2007 # Deliberately lying to another person that one has attained a superior human state, such as claiming to be an arahant when one knows one is not, or claiming to have attained one of the jhānas when one knows one has not. The pārājikas are more specific definitions of the first four of the Five Precepts.  Saṅghādisesa  The thirteen saṅghādisesas are rules requiring an initial and subsequent meeting of the sangha (communal meetings). If the monk breaks any rule here he has to undergo a period of probation or discipline after which, if he shows himself to be repentant, he may be reinstated by a sangha of not less than twenty monks. Like the pārājikas, the saṅghādisesas can only come about through the monk's own intention and cannot be accidentally invoked. The thirteen saṅghādisesas for bhikkus are: # Discharge of semen or getting someone to discharge your semen, except while dreaming # Lustful bodily contact with a woman, including kissing or holding hands # Making lustful remarks to a woman alluding to her genitals or sexual intercourse # Requesting sexual favors from a woman, or telling her that she would benefit spiritually from having sex with the monk. # Arranging for a date, affair, or marriage between a man and woman # Building a hut without permission from the sangha, or building a hut that exceed 3 x 1.75 meters in size # Having someone else build a hut for you without permission from the sangha, or exceeding 3 x 1.75 meters in size # Making unfounded charges about another bhikkhu in the hopes of having him disrobed # Making deceitfully worded charges about another bhikkhu in the hopes of having him disrobed # Agitating for a schism, even after having been rebuked three times # Supporting an agitator, even after he was rebuked three times (only applies if there are fewer than four supporters) # Rejecting well-grounded criticism, even after having been rebuked three times # Criticizing the justice of one's own banishment, even after having been rebuked three times  Aniyata  The aniyata are two indefinite rules where a monk is accused of having committed an offence with a woman in a screened (enclosed) or private place by a lay person. It is indefinite because the final outcome depends on whether the monk acknowledges the offence. Benefit of the doubt is given to the monk unless there is over-riding evidence. Thus it is not proper for a monk to be alone with a woman, especially in screened or private places. # Sitting in private with a woman on a seat secluded enough for sexual intercourse and the monk acknowledges the offense # Sitting in private with a woman on a seat not sufficiently secluded for sexual intercourse but sufficiently so to address lewd words and the monk acknowledges the offense  Nissaggiya pācittiya  The nissaggiya pācittiya are rules entailing \\"confession with forfeiture.\\" They are mostly concerned with the possessing of items which are disallowed or obtained in disallowable ways. The monk must forfeit the item and then confess his offense to another monk. There are thirty nissaggiya pācittiya for bhikkhu.  Pācittiya  Pacittiya are rules entailing confession. There are ninety-two pacittiya; these are minor violations which do not entail expulsion or any probationary periods. The Buddhist Monastic Code, by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Link: https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/Section0000.html  Patidesanīya  Patidesaniya are violations which must be verbally acknowledged. # Accepting and eating food from an unrelated bhikkuṇī. # Accepting and eating food after a bhikkuṇī has instructed the donors on whom to give what food, and none of the bhikkus rebuke the bhikkuṇī. # Accepting and eating food from a family that the sangha designates as \\"in training\\", that is, preparing to becoming arahants, unless if the monk is sick. # Accepting and eating food from a family living in a dangerous location, unless if the monk is sick.

In many countries, it is also standard for novice monks (samanera) to follow the Sekhiyavatta rules in addition to the Ten Precepts.  Adhikarana-samatha  Adhikarana-samatha are seven rules for settlement of legal processes that concern monks only. # When an issue is settled, the verdict should be in the presence of the sangha, the parties, the Dhamma and the Vinaya. # If the bhikku is innocent, the verdict should be \\"mindfulness\\". # If the bhikku was or is insane, the verdict should be \\"past insanity\\". # If the bhikku confesses to the exact allegations, the verdict should be \\"acting in accordance with what was admitted\\". # If the dispute cannot be unanimously settled, the sangha should take a vote and the verdict should be \\"acting in accordance with the majority\\". # If the bhikku confesses only after interrogation, the verdict should be \\"acting in accordance with the accused's further misconduct\\". # If both sides agree that they are not acting the way monks ought to, they can call a full assembly of the sima and confess their mistakes, and the verdict should be \\"covering over as with grass.\\"  Notes  1\\\\.

Biological processes are generally unidirectional and are very good examples of \\"kinetic\\" isotope reactions. All organisms preferentially use lighter isotopic species, because \\"energy costs\\" are lower, resulting in a significant fractionation between the substrate (heavier) and the biologically mediated product (lighter). As an example, photosynthesis preferentially takes up the light isotope of carbon 12C during assimilation of an atmospheric CO2 molecule. This kinetic isotope fractionation explains why plant material (and thus fossil fuels, which are derived from plants) is typically depleted in 13C by 25 per mil (2.5 per cent) relative to most inorganic carbon on Earth. A naturally occurring example of non-biological kinetic fractionation occurs during the evaporation of seawater to form clouds under conditions in which some part of the transport is unidirectional, such as evaporation into very dry air . In this instance, isotopically lighter water molecules (i.e., those with 16O) will evaporate slightly more easily than will the isotopically heavier water molecules with 18O, and this difference will be greater than it would be if the evaporation was taking place under equilibrium conditions (with bidirectional transport). During this process the oxygen isotopes are fractionated: the clouds become enriched with 16O, and the seawater becomes enriched in 18O. Whereas equilibrium fractionation makes the vapor about 10 per mil (1%) depleted in 18O relative to the liquid water, kinetic fractionation enhances this fractionation and often makes vapor that is about 15 per mil (1.5%) depleted. Condensation occurs almost exclusively by equilibrium processes, and so it enriches cloud droplets somewhat less than evaporation depletes the vapor. This explains part of the reason why rainwater is observed to be isotopically lighter than seawater. The isotope of hydrogen in water, deuterium, is much less sensitive to kinetic fractionation than oxygen isotopes, relative to the very large equilibrium fractionation of deuterium. For this reason kinetic fractionation does not deplete deuterium nearly as much, in a relative sense, as 18O. This gives rise to an excess of deuterium in vapor and rainfall, relative to seawater. The value of this \\"deuterium excess\\", as it is called, is about +10 per mil (1%) in most meteoric waters and its non-zero value is a direct manifestation of kinetic isotope fractionation. A generalized treatment of kinetic isotopic effects is via the GEBIK and GEBIF equations describing transient kinetic isotope effects.Maggi F. and W. J.

With AU$65.98 billion in the 2016 financial year, it is the largest Australian company by revenue, overtaking Woolworths and BHP. Wesfarmers is the largest private employer in Australia, with approximately 220,000 employees. Wesfarmers was founded in 1914 as a co-operative to provide services and merchandise to Western Australian farmers. It was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 1984 and grew into a major retail conglomerate.  History  1930s letterhead with company details of that time Westralian Farmers Co‐operative Limited was formed in 1914 as a cooperative company by the Farmers' and Settlers' Association of Western Australia, to acquire the assets of the West Australian Producers' Union, to be focused on the provision of services and merchandise to the Western Australian rural community.See Western Australian Farmers Federation for the relationship between the Co-operative and the CBH Group in its early history By 1919, more than 65 local co-operative companies were acting as agents for Westralian Farmers Limited. In 1924, it established the first public radio station in Western Australia with 6WF, before it passed into the hands of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1929, now called ABC Radio Perth By the 1940s, the company's business included \\"being wheat and general merchants; country distribution for Commonwealth Oil Refineries Ltd; wool, livestock, skin and produce auctioneers; grain & fruit exporters; insurance underwriters; acquiring agents for the wheat pool of W.A.\\" Known as Westralian Farmers Limited, it had premises in various locations within the Perth central business district. In the 1940s there were premises at 563-571 Wellington Street. They also had premises in Newman Street in Fremantle. In 1949, Wesfarmers acquired Ashburton Transport, which at the time was lossmaking. The following year it also acquired its major competitor Gascoyne Trading, combining the operations of the two companies to supply the northwest of Western Australia. Along with wool and mail, it carted bananas from Carnarvon to Perth, returning with stores and mail from Perth. Gascoyne Trading introduced refrigerated transport to the region and three trailer road trains that now carry loads up to 115 tonnes. In 1984, Westralian Farmers Co- operative Limited formed Wesfarmers Limited, restructuring from a co-operative to a public company and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange on 15 November 1984. Initially the Co-operative retained 60% of the ordinary shares, guaranteeing that the co-op's farmer members retained control, and the rest was distributed to its members. In 1991, 19 m³ of the records of Westralian Farmers Co-operative were deposited with the J S Battye Library in Perth. =Rural business, Dalgety Farmers and Wesfarmers Landmark= Bought in January 1993 the integration of Dalgety Farmers with Wesfarmers proved more difficult than expected. For a time the merged rural agency and merchandise business was Wesfarmers Dalgety until renamed Wesfarmers Landmark in March 2001 after IAMA Limited was brought in. Landmark, Wesfarmers foundation business, was sold to AWB Limited (originally the Australia Wheat Board) in August 2003. =Bunnings= An initial investment in 10 percent of Bunnings in February 1987 reached full ownership in January 1994. Bunnings bought UK retailer Homebase in February 2016 and Britain's first Bunnings store opened twelve months later in February 2017. They were 265 well-located stores and Wesfarmers believed Bunnings' management would greatly improve their modest profits. The plan was to make changes gently but tactics changed and local management, perceived as under-performing, was removed and replaced by expatriate management. The expatriate management's changes alienated the existing customer base and, aided by a poor retailing climate, brought a rapid decline into losses. A strategic review by Wesfarmers resulted in the May 2018 sale of the business to Hilco Capital at a loss of (Australian) $1.96 billion.Going off script: how the $1.7b Bunnings UK disaster unfolded.

It was sold in 2006 to Babcock & Brown and Queensland Rail. =End of co-operative ownership= In 2001, Wesfarmers become a freely-traded publicly listed company with open ownership. After becoming a public company, Wesfarmers diversified its interests by acquiring other businesses.  Divisions  Home improvement and office supplies = This division is made up of Bunnings Warehouse, a retailer of home improvement and outdoor living products, servicing home and commercial customers in Australia and New Zealand, and Officeworks, a retailer and supplier of office products for home, business and education in Australia.

Bunnings employs more than 33,000 staff and Officeworks employs more than 6,000 staff. In January 2016, Home Retail Group accepted an offer from Wesfarmers to acquire the British home improvement retailer and garden centre Homebase. Stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland began to be rebranded as Bunnings following the takeover. However, following Wesfarmer's sale of Homebase to Hilco in May 2018, it was reported that the 24 stores already converted would return to the \\"Homebase\\" branding. = Department stores = In February 2016, Wesfarmers announced a restructure of its department store businesses into a single division named Department Stores, with each brand continuing to operate independently.  Kmart  Kmart is a discount department store retailer in Australia and New Zealand, and a provider of retail automotive services, repairs and tyres in Australia. Kmart has 228 Kmart stores and 259 Kmart Tyre & Auto Service centres. Kmart employs more than 31,000 staff.  Target  Target is a mid-level department store retailer in Australia.

The farm itself has always been the largest in the Faroe Islands. The old farmhouse of Kirkjubøur dates back to the 11th century. It was the episcopal residence and seminary of the Diocese of the Faroe Islands, from about 1100. The legend says that the wood for the block houses came as driftwood from Norway and was accurately bundled and numbered, just for being set up. Note that there is no forest in the Faroes, with the exception of a wood in northern Tórshavn, and wood is a very valuable material. Many such wood legends are thus to be found in Faroese history. The oldest part is a so- called roykstova (reek parlour, or smoke room). Perhaps it was moved one day, because it does not fit to its foundation. Another ancient room is the loftstovan (loft room). It is supposed that Bishop Erlendur wrote the 'Sheep Letter' here in 1298. This is the earliest document of the Faroes we know today. It is the statute concerning sheep breeding on the Faroes. Today the room is the farm's library. The stórastovan (large room) is from a much later date, being built in 1772. Though the farmhouse is a museum, the 17th generation of the Patursson family, which has occupied it since 1550, still lives there. Shortly after the Reformation in the Faroe Islands in 1538, all the real estate of the Catholic Church was seized by the King of Denmark. This was about half of the land in the Faroes, and since then called \\"King's Land\\" (). The largest piece of King's Land was the farm in Kirkjubøur due to the above-mentioned episcopal residence. This land is today owned by the Faroese government, and the Paturssons are tenants from generation to generation. It is always the oldest son who becomes King's Farmer, and in contrast to the privately-owned land, the King's Land is never divided between the sons. The farm holds sheep, cattle and some horses. It is possible to get a coffee here and buy fresh mutton and beef directly from the farmer. In the winter season there is also hare hunting for the locals. Groups can rent the roykstovan for festivities and will be served original Faroese cuisine. Other notable buildings near the farmhouse are the Magnus Cathedral and Saint Olav's Church, which also date back to the medieval period.  People  Notable people who were born here or lived here for a period: * Sverre I of Norway (1151–1202), grew up here and went to the priest school. * Bishop Erlendur (d. 1308), wrote the Sheep Letter and built the Magnus Cathedral. * Súsanna Helena Patursson (1864–1916), first feminist of the Faroes. * King's farmer Jóannes Patursson (1866–1946), oldest brother of Helena, nationalist leader and writer. * Sverre Patursson (1871–1960) brother of Helena and Jóannes, writer, journalist and environmentalist. * Erlendur Patursson (1913–1986), son of Jóannes, writer and nationalist politician. * Tróndur Patursson (born 1944), great-grandson of Jóannes, artist and adventurer.

He was U.S. marshal of the District of Columbia, appointed by President James Monroe (18171825) and serving in the position through 1830, during the first two years of the administration of Andrew Jackson. Ringgold also owned a leather factory and curing shop in Georgetown. He was appointed Treasurer of the Georgetown Savings Institution in what was then a separate jurisdiction later annexed by the District of Columbia. Ringgold was the son of Mary (Galloway) and Thomas Ringgold, and was from a prominent early-American family that came to the British colonies in the early seventeenth century. He had accompanied James Madison when the president and his cabinet were forced to flee Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812. Afterward, he was named as a member of the Presidential Commission in charge of restoring important Washington buildings after the burning, including the Capitol. In 1825 he built a house in the capital; it is now known as the Ringgold-Carroll House, referring also to a later resident. The house has been designated as an historic property and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Boarders in the house during Ringgold's residency included Supreme Court Justices John Marshall and Joseph Story, both of whom considered Ringgold a friend. Ringgold married and had a family. Through his daughter Catherine, who married Edward Douglass White, Sr., he was the grandfather of Edward Douglass White, who was appointed a Justice of the United States Supreme Court in 1894 and served as Chief Justice from 1910-1921. Ringgold owned slaves, among them was Thomas H. Ringgold, a Mulatto who was reportedly fathered by Tench. Thomas was born in Maryland and later became a runaway slave. Thomas married Mary E., who was born a free Black. He then made his way to Springfield, Massachusetts via the \\"underground railroad,\\" circa 1848. There, he became a successful barber in Chicopee, MA. In response to a newspaper notice, he returned to buy his freedom. Using a lawyer in Alexandria, VA, he secured his freedom and returned to Massachusetts. His wife died shortly after childbirth of their daughter, Henrietta B. S. Ringgold. Henrietta died a few months later, that same year. He re-married and moved, leaving his wife and two children in Springfield Cemetery, Massachusetts.

Public health surveillance may be used to track emerging health-related issues at an early stage and find active solutions in a timely manner. Surveillance systems are generally called upon to provide information regarding when and where health problems are occurring and who is affected. Public health surveillance systems can be passive or active. A passive surveillance system consists of the regular, ongoing reporting of diseases and conditions by all health facilities in a given territory. An active surveillance system is one where health facilities are visited and health care providers and medical records are reviewed in order to identify a specific disease or condition. Passive surveillance systems are less time-consuming and less expensive to run but risk under- reporting of some diseases. Active surveillance systems are most appropriate for epidemics or where a disease has been targeted for elimination. Techniques of public health surveillance have been used in particular to study infectious diseases. Many large institutions, such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have created databases and modern computer systems (public health informatics) that can track and monitor emerging outbreaks of illnesses such as influenza, SARS, HIV, and even bioterrorism, such as the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States. Many regions and countries have their own cancer registry, which is monitors the incidence of cancers to determine the prevalence and possible causes of these illnesses. Other illnesses such as one-time events like stroke and chronic conditions such as diabetes, as well as social problems such as domestic violence, are increasingly being integrated into epidemiologic databases called disease registries. A cost-benefit analysis is conducted on these registries to determine governmental funding for research and prevention. Systems that can automate the process of identifying adverse drug events, are currently being used, and are being compared to traditional written reports of such events. These systems intersect with the field of medical informatics, and are rapidly becoming adopted by hospitals and endorsed by institutions that oversee healthcare providers (such as JCAHO in the United States). Issues in regard to healthcare improvement are evolving around the surveillance of medication errors within institutions.disa.mil PDF Syndromic surveillance Syndromic surveillance is the analysis of medical data to detect or anticipate disease outbreaks. According to a CDC definition, \\"the term 'syndromic surveillance' applies to surveillance using health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response. Though historically syndromic surveillance has been utilized to target investigation of potential cases, its utility for detecting outbreaks associated with bioterrorism is increasingly being explored by public health officials.\\" The first indications of disease outbreak or bioterrorist attack may not be the definitive diagnosis of a physician or a lab. Using a normal influenza outbreak as an example, once the outbreak begins to affect the population, some people may call in sick for work/school, others may visit their drug store and purchase medicine over the counter, others will visit their doctor's office and other's may have symptoms severe enough that they call the emergency telephone number or go to an emergency department. Syndromic surveillance systems monitor data from school absenteeism logs, emergency call systems, hospitals' over-the-counter drug sale records, Internet searches, and other data sources to detect unusual patterns. When a spike in activity is seen in any of the monitored systems disease epidemiologists and public health professionals are alerted that there may be an issue. An early awareness and response to a bioterrorist attack could save many lives and potentially stop or slow the spread of the outbreak. The most effective syndromic surveillance systems automatically monitor these systems in real-time, do not require individuals to enter separate information (secondary data entry), include advanced analytical tools, aggregate data from multiple systems, across geo-political boundaries and include an automated alerting process. A syndromic surveillance system based on search queries was first proposed by Gunther Eysenbach, who began work on such a system in 2004. Inspired by these early, encouraging experiences, Google launched Google Flu Trends in 2008. More flu-related searches are taken to indicate higher flu activity. The results, which were published in Nature, closely matched CDC data, and led it by 1–2 weeks. More recently, a series of more advanced linear and nonlinear approaches to influenza modeling from Google search queries have been proposed. Extending Google's work researchers from the Intelligent Systems Laboratory (University of Bristol, UK) created Flu Detector; an online tool which based on Information Retrieval and Statistical Analysis methods uses the content of Twitter to nowcast flu rates in the UK. =Digital methods= Digital surveillance of public health largely relies on three methods: search-based trends on sites like Google and Wikipedia, social media posts on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and participatory surveillance websites such as Flu Near You and Influenzanet. Search trends provide indirect data on public health, while the latter two methods provide direct data. Search aggregates Search aggregates have been most frequently used to track and model influenza. A popular example is Google Flu Trends, which was first released in 2008. Wikipedia has also been used, though it is potentially prone to \\"noise\\", as it is a popular source of health information whether a user is ill or not. Social media Examples of social media public health surveillance include HealthTweets, which gathers data from Twitter. Twitter data is considered highly useful for public health research, as its data policies allow public access to 1% samples of raw tweets. Tweets can also be geolocated, which can be used to model the spread of contagious disease. It is the most used social media platform for public health surveillance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Facebook used aggregated, anonymized data collected from its platforms to provide human movement information to disease models. It also offered users a chance to participate in a disease symptom survey through Carnegie Mellon University. Surveillance sites Flu Near You and Influenzanet are two examples of crowd-sourced digital surveillance systems. Both sites recruit users to participate in surveys about influenza symptoms. Influenzanet was established in 2009, and operates in ten countries in Europe. Its predecessor was Grote Griepmeting, which was a Dutch/Belgian platform launched in 2003 and 2004. Flu Near You is used in the US. Another example of a surveillance sites is Dengue na Web, used to survey for dengue fever in Bahia, Brazil. Laboratory-based surveillance Some conditions, especially chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, are supposed to be routinely managed with frequent laboratory measurements. Since many laboratory results, at least in Europe and the US, are automatically processed by computerized laboratory information systems, the results are relatively easy to inexpensively collate in special purpose databases or disease registries. Unlike most syndromic surveillance systems, in which each record is assumed to be independent of the others, laboratory data in chronic conditions can be theoretically linked together at the individual patient level. If patient identifiers can be matched, a chronological record of each patient's laboratory results can be analyzed as well as aggregated to the population level. Laboratory registries allow for the analysis of the incidence and prevalence of the target condition as well as trends in the level of control. For instance, an NIH-funded program called the Vermedx Diabetes Information System maintained a registry of laboratory values of diabetic adults in Vermont and northern New York State in the US with several years of laboratory results on thousands of patients. The data included measures of blood sugar control (glycosolated hemoglobin A1C), cholesterol, and kidney function (serum creatinine and urine protein), and were used to monitor the quality of care at the patient, practice, and population levels. Since the data contained each patient's name and address, the system was also used to communicate directly with patients when the laboratory data indicated the need for attention. Out of control test results generated a letter to the patient suggesting they take action with their medical provider. Tests that were overdue generated reminders to have testing performed. The system also generated reminders and alerts with guideline-based advice for the practice as well as a periodic roster of each provider's patients and a report card summarizing the health status of the population. Clinical and economic evaluations of the system, including a large randomized clinical trial, demonstrated improvements in adherence to practice guidelines and reductions in the need for emergency department and hospital services as well as total costs per patient. The system has been commercialized and distributed to physicians, insurers, employers and others responsible for the care of chronically ill patients. It is now being expanded to other conditions such as chronic kidney disease. A similar system, The New York City A1C Registry, is in used to monitor the estimated 600,000 diabetic patients in New York City, although unlike the Vermont Diabetes Information System, there are no provisions for patients to have their data excluded from the NYC database. The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has linked additional patient services to the registry such as health information and improved access to health care services. As of early 2012, the registry contains over 10 million test results on 3.6 million individuals. Although intended to improve health outcomes and reduce the incidence of the complications of diabetes, a formal evaluation has not yet been done. In May 2008, the City Council of San Antonio, Texas approved the deployment of an A1C registry for Bexar County. Authorized by the Texas legislature and the state Health Department, the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District implemented the registry which drew results from all the major clinical laboratories in San Antonio. The program was discontinued in 2010 due to lack of funds. Laboratory surveillance differs from population-wide surveillance because it can only monitor patients who are already receiving medical treatment and therefore having lab tests done. For this reason, it does not identify patients who have never been tested. Therefore, it is more suitable for quality management and care improvement than for epidemiological monitoring of an entire population or catchment area.

It depicts not the actual birth of Venus from the sea, but her transportation in a shell as a fully mature woman from the sea to Paphos in Cyprus. She is considered the epitome of the Classical Greek and Roman ideal of the female form and beauty, on par with Venus de Milo. For Bouguereau, it is considered a tour de force. The canvas stands at just over high, and wide. The subject matter, as well as the composition, resembles a previous rendition of this subject, Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, as well as Raphael's The Triumph of Galatea. Description The Nymphaeum, executed by Bouguereau in 1878. Venus' figure was enlarged from this nymph. At the center of the painting, Venus stands nude on a scallop shell being pulled by a dolphin, one of her symbols. Fifteen putti, including Cupid and his lover Psyche, and several nymphs and centaurs have gathered to witness Venus' arrival. Most of the figures are gazing at her, and two of the centaurs are blowing into conch and Triton shells, signaling her arrival. Venus is considered to be the embodiment of feminine beauty and form, and these traits are shown in the painting. Her head is tilted to one side, and her facial expression reflects that she is calm and comfortable with her nudity. She raises her arms,Similar to Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres' Venus Anadyomène. arranging her thigh-length, brown hair, swaying elegantly in an \\"S\\" curve contrapposto, emphasizing the curves of her body. Venus' figure was enlarged from a nymph from Bouguereau's The Nymphaeum, completed in 1878, a year earlier. The nymph is slightly thinner, and her breasts are fuller and more rounded. Venus' contrapposto is more intense, and her hair is also longer and lighter than the nymph's, but she arranges it almost identically. To the upper-left of the painting, there is a shadow in the clouds. It appears to be the silhouette of the artist, with a head, shoulder, arm, and a raised fist that would seem to hold a paintbrush.

Solar Lottery is a 1955 science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick. It was his first published novel and contains many of the themes present in his later work. It was also published in altered form in the UK as World of Chance. The main story is about a man named Ted Benteley who lives in a strange world, dominated by percentages and the lottery. Lotteries are used to choose the next leader as well as a new assassin, whose job is to try to kill the leader or \\"Quizmaster\\". Everybody in society has the opportunity to be selected as a leader or an assassin. Benteley unexpectedly gets chosen to be a member of the committee trying to assassinate the new Quizmaster and he must decide what he is going to do. Plot summary Solar Lottery takes place in a world dominated by logic and numbers, and loosely based on a numerical military strategy employed by US and Soviet intelligence called minimax (part of game theory). The Quizmaster, head of the world government, is chosen through a sophisticated computerized lottery. This element of randomization serves as a form of social control since nobody – in theory at least – has any advantage over anybody else in their chances becoming the next Quizmaster. Society is entertained by a televised selection process in which an assassin is also (allegedly) chosen at random. By countering and putting down threats to his life, using telepathic bodyguards, the leader gains the respect of the people. If he loses his life, a new Quizmaster, as well as another assassin, are again randomly selected. Quizmasters have held office for timespans ranging from a few minutes to several years. The average life expectancy is therefore on the order of a couple of weeks. The novel tells the story of Ted Benteley, an idealistic young worker unhappy with his position in life. Benteley attempts to get a job in the prestigious office of Quizmaster Reese Verrick. Reese has just been forced out of office, however, and Benteley gets tricked into swearing an unbreakable oath of personal fealty to the former world leader. Verrick then makes it clear that his organization's mission is to assassinate the new Quizmaster, Leon Cartwright, in the world's most anticipated \\"competition\\". To defeat the telepathic security web protecting Cartwright, Verrick and his team invent an android named Keith Pellig, into which different volunteers' minds are alternately embedded for the purpose of breaking any steady telepathic lock on the assassin. Cartwright ultimately kills Verrick, and Benteley, much to his own astonishment, becomes the next Quizmaster. A second plotline concerns a team of Leon Cartwright's followers travelling to the far reaches of the solar system in search of a mysterious cult figure named John Preston, who, 150 years after his disappearance, is thought to somehow be alive on the legendary tenth planet known as the \\"Flame Disc\\". Publishing history Dick completed the first draft of Solar Lottery in March 1954. In December he completed a second draft at the request of Ace Books Editor Donald Wollheim, cutting six passages totalling as much as ten thousand words and adding perhaps seven thousand. In the meantime, however, the book had been sold to a publisher in the UK, where it appeared as World of Chance: this version includes the cut passages. However, the entire text of this version was severely copyedited, with wholesale eliminations of adjectives.\\"What the Quizmaster Took: Solar Lottery and World of Chance: A Comparison\\", by Gregg Rickman, in The Philip K. Dick Society Newsletter, issues 19–22 When Solar Lottery was first published in the United States by Ace Books, as one half of Ace Double D-103 in May 1955, it was bound dos-à-dos with The Big Jump by Leigh Brackett. The Ace Double edition ran 131 pages. Ace published a standard-format edition of the novel in 1959, running 188 pages. Its 1968 reissue, also running 188 pages, was labelled, misleadingly in view of the existence of the UK edition, \\"Complete & Unabridged\\". Reception Reviewing the Ace Double, Anthony Boucher praised the novel as \\"built up with the detail of a Heinlein and the satire of a Kornbluth\\". Declaring that Dick had created \\"a strange and highly convincing and self-consistent future society,\\" he faulted Solar Lottery only for \\"a tendency, in both its nicely contrasted plots, to dwindle away at the end\\".\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, August 1955, p.94.

Apostates and Their Role in the Construction of Grievance Claims Against the Northeast Kingdom/Messianic Communities article in the book The Politics of Religious Apostasy: The Role of Apostates in the Transformation of Religious Movements edited by David G. Bromley Westport, CT, Praeger Publishers, (1998). the Messianic Communities, and the Community Apostolic Order is a new religious movement founded by Gene Spriggs (now known as Yoneq) that sprang out of the Jesus movement in 1972 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The group calls itself an attempt to recreate the 1st-century church in the Book of Acts; the name \\"Twelve Tribes\\" is also derived from a quote of the Apostle Paul in Acts 26:7. The group has also been referred to as The Yellow Deli People and informally as The Community. History The origins of the Twelve Tribes movement can be traced to a ministry for teenagers called the \\"Light Brigade\\" in 1972. The ministry operated out of a small coffee shop called \\"The Lighthouse\\" in the home of Gene Spriggs and his wife Marsha. The Light Brigade began living communally and opened a restaurant called \\"The Yellow Deli\\" while attending several churches, before deciding on the First Presbyterian Church. The Light Brigade, while at First Presbyterian, caused friction with the establishment by bringing in anyone who was willing to come with them, including members of different social classes and racial groups, a practice not engaged in at that time. On January 12, 1975, the group arrived at First Presbyterian only to find out that the service had been cancelled for the Super Bowl, this led the group to form The Vine Christian Community Church. During this time, the church \\"planted\\" churches, each with its own Yellow Deli, in Dalton and Trenton, Georgia; Mentone, Alabama; and Dayton, Tennessee. Northeast Kingdom Community Church members leaving the courthouse with their children on June 22, 1984 Their withdrawal from the religious mainstream turned what had been a friction-filled relationship into an outcry against them. They began holding their own services, which they called \\"Critical Mass\\" in Warner Park, appointing elders and baptizing people outside any denominational authority. The deteriorating relationship between the group and the religious and secular Chattanooga community attracted the attention of The Parents' Committee to Free Our Children from the Children of God and the Citizen's Freedom Foundation who labeled the church a cult and heavily attacked Spriggs as a cult leader. This led to what the group refers to today as the \\"Cult Scare\\" in the late seventies. A series of deprogrammings starting in the summer of 1976 that were carried out by Ted Patrick. The group nevertheless largely ignored the negative press and the wider world in general, and continued to operate its businesses opening the Areopagus and a second local Yellow Deli in downtown Chattanooga. In 1978 an invitation was received from a small church in Island Pond, Vermont for Spriggs to minister there; the offer was declined but the group began moving in stages to the rural town, naming the church there The Northeast Kingdom Community Church. One of Patrick's last deprogramming cases in Chattanooga occurred in 1980; it involved a police detective who, according to Swantko, had his 27-year-old daughter arrested on a falsified warrant in order to facilitate her deprogramming, with the support of local judges. The group continued moving, closing down all of its Yellow Delis and associated churches except for the one in Dalton. At one point, a leader conceded that the group was deeply in debt before closing the Dalton church down and moving the last members to Vermont. Common Sense Cafe and Yellow Deli in Island Pond, Vermont; owned and operated by Twelve Tribes. Permanently closed, as of 2019 The move to Vermont, combined with an initial period of economic hardship, caused some members to leave. The Citizen's Freedom Foundation conducted several meetings in Barton to draw attention to the group. The Citizen's Freedom Foundation had made allegations of mind control in Chattanooga, but now it made accusations of child abuse. In 1983, charges were brought against Charles \\"Eddie\\" Wiseman (an elder in the group) for misdemeanor simple assault; this, combined with multiple child custody cases, formed the basis for a search warrant. On June 22, 1984 Vermont State Police and Vermont Social Rehabilitation Services seized 112 children; all were released the same day because the raid was ruled unconstitutional. Due to what the group perceived were a massive misunderstanding of the events and concerns leading up to and surrounding the raid, its members began formal relationships with their neighbors. Two months after the raid, the case against Wiseman fell apart after the main witness recanted, saying he was under duress from the anticult movement. The case was later dropped in 1985 after a judge ruled that Wiseman had been denied his right to a speedy trial. Eddie Wiseman's public defender, Jean Swantko, who had been present during the raid, later joined and married Wiseman. Peacemaker 1 bus at a June 22, 1984 Raid anniversary in Island Pond, Vermont. By 1989, the church had become widely accepted in Island Pond and grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, opening branches in several different countries, including Canada, Australia, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Argentina, and the United Kingdom. During this expansion phase, the group used the name Messianic Communities, before deciding to rename itself The Twelve Tribes. Through the mid-2000s (decade), the group remained controversial, with accusations of child labor, custodial interference, and illegal homeschooling. In 2006 the group held a reunion for members and friends of the Vine Christian Community Church and the former Yellow Deli in Warner Park, announcing a new community in Chattanooga. The movement proceeded to open a new Yellow Deli in 2008, nearly 30 years after leaving Chattanooga. Beliefs and practices The Twelve Tribes' beliefs resemble those of Christian fundamentalism, the Hebrew Roots movement, Messianic Judaism and the Sacred Name Movement; however, the group believes that all other denominations are fallen, and it therefore refuses to align itself with any denomination or movement. They believe that in order for the messiah to return, the Church needs to be restored to its original form seen in Acts 2:38–42 and Acts 4:32–37. This restoration is not merely the restoration of the 1st-century church, but the creation of a new Israel consisting of Twelve Tribes in twelve geographic regions. Part of this restoration is the return to observing the sabbath, maintaining some of the Mosaic law including dietary laws, and the festivals. This interpretation of the prophesied restoration of Israel, combined with the perceived immorality in the world leads the group to believe that the end times has arrived, though no date has been set. One noted aspect of the group is its insistence on using the name \\"Yahshua\\", as opposed to Jesus. Because the name \\"Yahshua\\" represents the nature of Jesus, the group similarly bestows upon each member a Hebrew name that is meant to reflect the personality of the individual. The group believes there are Three Eternal Destinies. It believes that after the Fall of Man every person is given a conscience; and that after dying every person goes to a state of being called death (in Hebrew Sheol and Greek Hades) regardless of faith. Upon the second coming, believers will be brought back for the thousand years to reign with \\"Yahshua\\" before the last judgment. At the end of this millennium, all of the nonbelievers will be judged according to their deeds and put into one of two groups: the righteous and the filthy/unjust. The filthy and the unjust will be sent to the Lake of Fire while the righteous will go on into eternity and fill the universe. \\"We Need Radical Change\\" an example of Twelve Tribes \\"free paper\\" commonly distributed at events as a form of Evangelism The leadership within is structured as a series of Councils which consists of local councils, regional councils, and a global Apostolic Council; the group is also overseen within these councils by a fluid number of teachers, deacons, deaconesses, elders and apostles. Gene Spriggs is highly regarded as the first person to open up his home to brothers and sisters, but members state that he is not regarded as a spiritual figurehead. The group operates as a 501(d) – \\"for-profit organization with a religious purpose and a common treasury.\\" The community pays property taxes, but the 501(d) structure tends to result in no income tax liability. Courtship within the Community involves a \\"waiting period\\" in which the man or woman expresses their desire to get to know the other person. The couple then receives input from the community while spending time together. The couple is betrothed (engaged) if their parents (or the entire community, if they are adults) confirm their love and compatibility; the couple is then permitted to hold hands. Weddings are dramatized pre-enactments of what the group believes will happen at the end of time when \\"Yahshua\\" returns to earth for his bride. Children have been noted to play a central role in the group's eschatological beliefs, because future generations of the group will be the \\"144,000\\" of Revelation 7. Children are homeschooled. Within the group, teenagers may take on apprenticeships in the group's industries to be taught trades complementing their education. The group acknowledges using corporal punishment with a \\"reed-like rod\\" like a balloon stick (a minimum) across the child's bottom, though many former members, including children raised in the group, say punishments can include far more severe implements. Group members do not send their children to college, believing that, \\"college is [not] a healthy environment, either for learning or social development.\\"  Businesses  The twelve tribes attempts to support itself in means that allow its members to work together, without the need to seek outside employment. Businesses the group owns and operates include: \\\\- Parchment Press. A printing company offering printing services, and also printing and selling the group’s literature. \\\\- BOJ Construction - a general contractor based in Plymouth MA and operating Nationally \\\\- Commonwealth Construction - construction contracting, primarily in the Southeastern US \\\\- Greener Formulas - A soap and bodycare research and development firm with ties to its other business, Common Sense Farm \\\\- Common Sense Farm - A soap and bodycare products manufacturing and distribution facility located on the group's farm in Cambridge NY \\\\- Simon The Tanner - a chain of shoe stores/outdoor outfitters, currently with locations in New Hampshire and Vermont. The group also runs several chains of restaurants. \\\\- Yellow Deli Restaurants \\\\- Common Ground Cafe Restaurants Controversies Since its inception, the group has ignited controversy and garnered unfavorable attention from the media, the anti-cult movement and governments. New England Institute of Religious Research's Executive Director the Rev. Bob Pardon warns in his report that \\"Messianic Communities, under the leadership of Spriggs, has tended towards an extreme authoritarianism\\" and a \\"Galatian heresy.\\" The Tribes have responded with a line-by-line response to the report and they continue to contest its large \\"errors, distortions, misunderstandings, and misjudgments\\", while criticizing the heavy use of apostates in his report. In France, the group was listed on the 1995 Governmental Report by the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France under the name \\"Ordre apostolique – Therapeutic healing environment.\\" Twelve Tribes members Jean Swantko and husband Ed Wiseman have made efforts to combat social stigma and the anti-cult movement by engaging in dialogue with hostile ex- members, the media and government authorities. Swantko has presented at scholarly conferences including CESNUR Communal Studies Association and Society for the Scientific Study of Religion as well as a chapter in James T. Richardson's Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe. The Twelve Tribes has been cited by Stuart A. Wright as a group suffering from \\"front-end/back-end disproportionality\\" in media coverage. According to Wright, the media often focuses on unsubstantiated charges against the group, but as charges are investigated and as cases fall apart, the media covers them significantly less at the end than it does at the beginning. Wright then asserts that this leaves the public with the impression that the group was guilty of the disproven charges. =Commentary on the Island Pond raid= The Island Pond raid has remained prominent in Vermont legal history; it was the subject of a Vermont Bar Association seminar in 2006. The group held anniversary events in both 1994 and 2000; and produced a 75-minute documentary. The Vermont Chapter of the ACLU also criticized the raid, calling it \\"frightening\\" and \\"the greatest deprivation of civil liberties to have occurred in recent Vermont history.\\" The then-Governor of Vermont, Richard Snelling, who had authorized the raid, reportedly drew the \\"hottest political fire of his career\\" in the weeks after; Vermont Attorney General John J. Easton, Jr. attributed the raid to assisting his campaign for governorship. In 1992, John Burchard, who had been the State Commissioner of Social and Rehabilitation Services, and Vanessa L. Malcarne, published an article in Behavioral Sciences and the Law, encouraging changes in the law that would have allowed the raid to succeed. =Teachings about Jews = It teaches that the Jews were guilty of the blood of Christ, quoting Matthew 27:25. Although often labelled antisemitic, the group repeatedly denies this accusation. Its members keep the Sabbath and the Jewish festivals of Pesach, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot. Youth have Bar Mitzvah and Bat Mitzvah celebrations, and they regularly perform Israeli folk dances. =Child labor and homeschooling controversies= In 2001, The New York Post ran an article accusing the group of child labor violations; and later attributed itself as having prompted the investigation. The Twelve Tribes responded with a press conference at the \\"Commonsense Farm\\" where the alleged child labor had taken place. The Twelve Tribes reported that during a random inspection by Estée Lauder Companies, the company discovered that several 14-year-olds had been found assisting their fathers in their cottage industry; this report was later confirmed by Estée Lauder who terminated their contract with Common Sense products. The group's official statement at the press conference stated that they believed that it was a family-owned business, and children ought to be able to help their parents in the business while making \\"no apology\\" for it. The New York State Department of Labor stated that they intended to visit all five of the Twelve Tribes' businesses. State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer asserted that apprenticeships amounted to indentured servitude and were illegal. Robert Redford's Sundance Catalog, who had contracted with Common Wealth Woodworks (another of the group's cottage industries that made furniture), also terminated their contract as a response to the allegations. The Labor Department found no violations at Common Sense Farm or Commonwealth Woodworks. They did propose a fine on fine two other industries: $2,000 for allegations of child labor law violations that the group's spokesperson, Jean Swantco Wiseman, was quoted in a news article as saying were for a 15-year-old pushing a wheelbarrow and another 15-year-old changing a lightbulb. In June 2018, another New York State investigation into the Common Sense Farm was launched, yielding allegations of child labor, after an Inside Edition article revealed children working in the group's soap factory. Twelve Tribes owned business Greener Formulas had contracted with brands including Acure and Savannah Bee to manufacture its private label bodycare products and was using the facilities of Common Sense Farm (also owned by the group) for production. Both Acure and Savannah Bee have since terminated their contracts with Greener Formulas. In Germany and France, the controversies centered on the issues of homeschooling, health, child abuse, and religious freedom. The group has several times been in conflict with authorities in Germany and France over homeschooling their children, with a particularly long and protracted dispute between the community in Klosterzimmern, in the municipality of Deiningen, Bavaria, and Bavarian education authorities. Homeschooling is illegal in Germany, with rare exceptions. When fines and arrests failed to have an effect on the community, authorities granted the group the right to operate a private school on the commune's premises, under state supervision. The agreement entailed that the school would not teach sex education and evolution. Other Issues: On June 26, 2018, the religious group was showcased on the Vice HD channel in the United States on an episode of their Cults and Extreme Belief series, as former member Samie Brosseau accused the group of abusive practices.https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/1743444035943/twelve-tribes In July 2019, the FBI released a 40 page summary of the results of a closed preliminary investigation stemming from allegations of child abuse at the group's Hiddenite NC Property. The documents revealed the existence of other investigations over the years to include suspicions of child abuse in other compounds. There were also more bizarre allegations including deaths that were thought to be suspicious, allegations of oddities during spiritual rituals, as well as unsubstantiated allegations involving Founder Yoneq's conduct during his time in the Military. The documents also reveal the existence of a (now closed) Federal investigation into whether the State of Vermont had violated the group's civil rights in the 1984 raid. On February 19, 2020, Police in New South Wales Australia executed a search warrant as part of Strike Force Nanegai, on the group's Peppercorn Creek Farm property, seizing documents and other evidence in what has been a prolonged investigation into allegations of child abuse in the group. On March 3, 2020, police in New South Wales Australia returned for a more extensive search operation for stillborn babies buried on the property at Peppercorn Creek Farm and another of the groups properties. However, no bodies were reported to have been discovered and no arrests were made. Police raids in Germany On September 5, 2013, German police raided two communities belonging to the Twelve Tribes and removed 40 children to protect them from continued abuse. The reasons for the raid were the film shootings of a TV reporter, Wolfram Kuhnigk, who managed to secretly record how the sect beat their children. The group admits that they use a \\"reed-like rod\\" for discipline, but denies abusing their children. Sociologist of religion Susan Palmer pointed out that the doctors found no evidence of mistreatment in September 2013 following the police raids.Erich Mayer, FOREF Europe, Kontroverse um „Zwölf Stämme“ – Soziologin warnt vor gezielter Desinformation durch Sektenexperten, APA-OTS, 2015-01-01 In 2018 the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German move to take away the children from the sect.

It lies off the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast near Sozopol, a town with rich history and a popular tourist place, and is separated by a strait several hundred metres long from the small neighbouring St. Peter Island. Standing at above sea level, it is also the highest of the Bulgarian sea islands. It lies from the Stolets peninsula, the location of Sozopol's Old Town. History Around the 7th-4th century BC, the island was populated by Thracians. After Sozopol (Apollonia) was conquered by the Romans in 72 BC, a lighthouse was built on the island. Next to the Thracian sanctuary, the locals built a temple of Apollo featuring a bronze statue by Calamis standing in height, making it easy to see from the city. A complex of buildings was constructed around the temple in the southeastern part of the island, including health stations, inns, etc. After the conversion to Christianity, a monastical complex was built in the 5th-6th century on top of the ruins of the old Roman temple, including the Basilica of the Mother of God. Towards the 7th-9th century, the basilica was abandoned only to be reconstructed in the 10th century. The Monastery of John the Forerunner and the Baptist grew into an important centre of Christianity in the region; the buildings of the monastery and the church were reconstructed in 1262-1310. Archaeological research was carried out after 1985 for a couple of years, so today the remains of two churches, a royal residence, a library, part of the fortified wall with the gate and several monastic cells can be seen. The monastery was a stauropegic monastery of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and two former patriarchs may have been buried there after being sent into exile. Sozopol was conquered by the Ottomans together with Constantinople, in 1453, and the monastery was completely destroyed, but later reconstructed in 1467-1471. In the 1620s it was a refuge for Cossack pirates raiding the western Black Sea coast. Archaeologists have even discovered the remains of a Cossack feast in the church. The Ottomans destroyed the remaining buildings on St. Ivan Island in July 1629 in order not to be used by the pirates. It also played a part in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829, when it was used as a field hospital for Russian soldiers suffering from cholera and also had a Russian graveyard. Until the mid-19th century, when a natural phenomenon most likely separated them, the small St. Peter Island to the east of St. Ivan was most likely adjoined to it. Two small islets or large rocks also existed to the east of St. Peter, known by the names of Milos and Gata; they were last described by Russian war correspondents in the 1820s. There is also a lighthouse constructed by French engineers in 1884 and pointing to the Burgas Bay still standing on the island. In the 1970s and early 1980s, there was a project to build a large Balkantourist hotel on St. Ivan, but Todor Zhivkov's intervention prevented that. In August 2010 the BBC reported that remains of John the Baptist had been found on the island. Radiocarbon dating confirmed that the bones belonged to a man who had lived and died in the Middle East in the middle of the first century. Nature Apart from its historical significance, the island is also a nature reserve since 1993, with 72 species of birds nesting on the rocks and around the coast, 3 of which are endangered in the world and 15 in Europe. St. Ivan and the adjacent St. Peter Island host Bulgaria's largest colonies of Audouin's gull (Ichthyaetus audouinii) and Caspian gull (Larus cachinnans). St. Ivan Island is also inhabited by other rare species, such as Mediterranean monk seals. The rocks on the island are covered with black mussels.

Its local government area is the Shire of Murray. At the 2016 census, Pinjarra had a population of 4910. Pinjarra is an area rich in history, and is the home town of a former State Premier - Sir Ross McLarty. It is near the site of the Pinjarra massacre, where between 14 and 80 Noongar people were killed by British colonists in 1834. History The name was often shown spelt \\"Pinjarrup\\" on early maps, while the accepted spelling for many years was \\"Pinjarrah\\". There are conflicting theories regarding the meaning of the name, and it is usually said to mean \\"place of a swamp\\", as a corruption of the Aboriginal word \\"beenjarrup\\". However, Pinjarra is more likely to have been named after the Pindjarup people who frequented the area. Pinjarra is one of the earliest European settlements to occur in Western Australia; one of the first settlers in the area was Thomas Peel, who established a settlement at the mouth of the Murray River in 1830. In 1831, land was reserved for a townsite near a ford over the river. By 1834, word had spread about the rich loamy soils and pastures, bringing more Europeans to the area. In 1834, at the insistence of Thomas Peel, a group was organised and lead by Governor James Stirling to do something about the Aboriginals; this group attacked the village consisting of over 20 mia-mias just after dawn. They approached from both sides of the river, forcing the people into the river where they caught the victims, mostly women and children, in a crossfire. Many bodies were left to float down stream. Official reports referred to it as a battle, it was not until over 150 years later that it was recognised as one of many massacres by colonialist in Australia. Surveys were carried out in 1836 and land allocated to settlers in 1837. By early 1898 the population of the town was 400, 300 males and 100 females. A British child migration scheme run by Kingsley Fairbridge established a farm school in the area in the early 1900s. Hundreds of orphaned children were educated at Fairbridge Farm between 1913 and 1981. Fairbridge Chapel was built at Pinjarra, in 1924 to Herbert Baker's design. The author Kenneth (Seaforth) McKenzie grew up in Pinjarra, and parts of his experiences as a child living near the Murray River are found in his first novel The Young Desire It. In 1974, an alumina refinery was established by Alcoa Australia Ltd, causing a boost in the population of Pinjarra and nearby Mandurah. Pinjarra is also the site of the world’s largest bauxite mine. Facilities Pinjarra contains one shopping centre, Pinjarra Junction, which opened in 2008.http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=359&ContentID;=85043 It contains a Target, Coles Supermarket, Best & Less, Subway, The Reject Shop, Chicken Treat, Zambreros, Muffin Break, Liquorland and Sports Power. Pinjarra contains Pinjarra Primary School, Pinjarra Senior High School, and St Joseph's Catholic Primary School. Future and growth Because of its close proximity to Mandurah and recent infrastructure and amenities investments, Pinjarra's population is likely to increase significantly through new subdivisions surrounding the original town-site. Armadale Railway Line also planning to extend till Byford in first phase and till Pinjarra in Second Phase Transport Pinjarra station is located on the South Western Railway and served by Transwa's twice daily Australind service from Perth to Bunbury.Australind Timetable Transwa In September 2012 a Transperth bus service was inaugurated between Murray Hospital in southern Pinjarra and Mandurah railway station, via Mandurah Forum on Pinjarra Road, and Pinjarra town centre. Pinjarra is also on the South Western Highway between Armadale and Bunbury, something which has both helped and hindered the town. Traffic through the town during holiday seasons has been known to stretch for kilometres north or south. As a result, there have been calls for the construction of a road bypass of the town.

At the 2011 census, Dwellingup had a population of 383. Name Townsite lots were surveyed at this place by surveyor W.F. Rudall in 1909 after the Lands Department became aware that the site was planned as the terminus of the \\"Pinjarra-Marrinup Railway\\". Names suggested for the place by Rudall were \\"Dwellingerup\\" or \\"Marrinup\\", after nearby brooks, or \\"McLarty\\" after a local MLA who had been very active concerning the railway. Surveyor General H.F. Johnston chose \\"Dwellingupp\\" after being misinformed regarding the spelling of Dwellingerup Brook. Ignoring a suggestion from the Under Secretary to amend the name to \\"Dwellingdown\\", the Minister for Lands approved the name as \\"Dwellingup\\" in December 1909. Eventually, the spelling \\"Dwellingupp\\" was chosen by order of the Under Secretary for Lands, and the townsite was gazetted as Dwellingupp in February 1910. The spelling was amended to Dwellingup in 1915. Dwellingup is an Aboriginal name said to mean \\"place of nearby water\\" or \\"on and by the whole place there is fog, dew and mist\\". Bushfires In one of Western Australia's worst bushfires, many small surrounding communities in the area were destroyed, including 132 houses in Dwellingup itself, in the fires of 1961. There were no fatalities, but 800 people were left homeless. The town was rebuilt. Dwellingup experienced serious bushfires again over the week starting on 3 February 2007. Sixteen houses were destroyed and thousand of hectares of private property and forest were burnt. There was no loss of life. Bauxite mining Dwellingup is near the largest bauxite mine in the world, at Huntly,http://www.alcoa.com/australia/en/info_page/mining_huntly_willowdale.asp which supplies ore to the Pinjarra and Kwinana aluminium refineries. Facilities Dwellingup is home to Nanga Bush Camp, a popular camp for senior primary schools and high schools. Some of the activities at Nanga Bush Camp include water rafting, night watching, a swimming area and bush tracks. Another major attraction in the area is the Hotham Valley Railway. A Dwellingup Forest Ranger Tour operates between May and October, and is steam hauled between Pinjarra and Dwellingup. Dwellingup has a skate park and pump track. It also has the Munda Biddi Bike Trail and the Captain Fawcett 4WD Trail. The Bibbulmun Track, a long-distance walk trail, passes through Dwellingup.Website Bibbulmun Track Foundation Climate Dwellingup is one of the wettest inhabited places in Western Australia, with an average annual rainfall of over 1,200 mm.

Schou FishCam  Australia  Channel 31 Melbourne, Australia, had one of the more famous and long-lasting Fishcams. The Fishcam itself was originally used as a replacement to the more common testcards, shown when the station had nothing else to air. Due to extreme popularity though, the FishCam became an actual scheduled show on the network. The station has also released several VHS tapes of the program. The broadcast was accompanied by the music of unsigned Melbourne musicians. Rumours have abounded amongst fans that Channel 31 has played repeats of this program while it has continued to be labelled \\"live\\". From 4 March 2007 the broadcasting of FishCam on Channel 31 has ceased. On October 13, 2014 FishCam returned at the new time of 9pm hosted by Luis from Lessons with Luis. It ran for 11 episodes, ending on December 22, 2014, when the fish tank was broken during the final episode. Canada When St. John's television station NTV first commenced 24-hour broadcasting in the early-1970s, one of its overnight programs was a continuous shot of a fish tank. Denmark Between 1981 and 1985, the public Danish broadcaster Danmarks Radio (DR) aired a programme called pausefisk (pause fish) during long breaks between programming. Germany In 1992 when Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg launched, ORB Aquarium was among one of those original programs, consists of a 30 minute loop of Fish. Music was provided by Radio Brandenburg (now rbb radioeins). In September 1992, the show recurved 10,000 viewers and a 37.5% market share, the highest value in the history of ORB. That led to similar programs such as Space Night, first shown on Bayerischer Rundfunk in 1994, which is currently shown on ARD-alpha & Germany's Most Beautiful Railways aired on ARD between 1995 & 2013\\\\. ORB Aquarium Was discontinued in 2004. Hong Kong The ATV Network in Hong Kong also aired a Fishcam programme, in lieu of test card after the station signs off the air. The program's name was Telefishion (). It became an unexpected hit for the station, with the program performing as well as, if not better than, the station's normal primetime programs. The title of the show entered into popular vocabulary as one being incredibly bored. Norway The Norwegian public broadcaster NRK first aired a Fishcam-style programme called pausefiskene (pause-fishes) in black-and-white in 1965, converting to colour in the 1970s. Turkey Turkish broadcaster Digiturk broadcasts live fish tanks in their music channels under the name \\"Aquavision\\". Turkmenistan The state run youth channel Yaşlyk broadcasts a digital fish tank with the same piece of classical music playing in a loop after ending their daily transmissions until 6:55am.  Netscape  Netscape has a web feed of their fish tank, and for some time had an easter egg hidden in Netscape Communicator that would bring that page up when a user pressed CTRL + ALT + F. The Netscape Fishcam was the 2nd live camera to start broadcasting on the Web. The Netscape Fishcam went off line in the Summer of 2007 and has been moved to a new site a new tank housed in the offices of Zetta, Inc. by its original creator, Lou Montulli.

History Its signal is transmitted from Mt. Dandenong and Como Centre, South Yarra, reaching much of the Greater Melbourne, Geelong and West Gippsland areas on free-to-air television. The station began broadcasting officially on 6 October 1994. The Australian Broadcasting Authority had granted Melbourne Community Television Consortium (MCTC) with a temporary open-narrowcast licence on 5 March 1993. The framework of community television in Australia can be traced back to 1992, when the Government asked the ABA to conduct a trial of community television using the vacant sixth television channel 31. On 30 July 2004, the Australian Broadcasting Authority granted the station a full-time community broadcasting licence. C31 began broadcasting in digital during June 2010. C31 is primarily funded through sponsorship, grants, sale of airtime and member donations. The station does not receive any regular Government funding. The annual revenue of C31 is approximately (AUD) $2 million per year. For comparison, the Nine Network, an Australian commercial station, has $907 million annual revenue.James Packer, \\"Chairman's Address\\", Publishing and Broadcasting Limited Annual General Meeting, 27 October 2005 The station claims that \\"1.4 million Melbournians tune in each month\\"C31 Website - About C31 \\"...with over 1.4 million Melburnians tuning in each month\\" this figure is supplied by the ratings company OzTam. Individual programs can have ratings of up to 180,000 viewers. The C31 website was completely remodelled in 2009, and now offers streaming of every program they broadcast (if the producer consents). C31 Melbourne is the only community television broadcast in Australia which offers this. C31 announced to its digital service provider and officially began simulcasting from 2010 on Logical Channel Number 44. C31 officially started broadcasting in Digital on 28 May 2010 with the official launch date on 11 June. There are no plans for the expansion of community TV in Regional Victoria & Tasmania in the near future. On 27 June 2010, the community TV programming was rebranded \\"C31\\" with new logo, identities, schedule and watermark. The C31 program schedule is a program line-up is published on its website, in most Australian electronic program guides (EPGs) and in the newspapers. On 1 March 2012, C31 ceased broadcasting its analogue signal, and is now available only as logical digital channel 44. In September 2014, Australian federal communications minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that licensing for community television stations would end in December 2015. In September 2015, Turnbull, then Prime Minister, announced an extension of the deadline to 31 December 2016. The deadline was further extended twice at the last minute by Minister for Communications Mitch Fifield, first to 30 June 2017, and later to 31 December 2017. Fifield made an additional extension to 30 June 2018 as part of the government's deal with the Nick Xenophon Team to garner support for large-scale media reforms in the Senate, while a further extension, announced on 1 June 2018, gave broadcasters an additional two years through 30 June 2020. In June 2020, they were given another 12-month extension. C31, like other community television stations, is moving operations online, and streams its channel live on their website which allows access to viewers outside of its traditional broadcast area. In April 2016, C31 became the first community station to offer a mobile app that offers live streaming and video on demand catch up television. Transmission quality C31 is available on digital via UHF 32 in Melbourne & Geelong and UHF 66 in South Yarra. C31 transmits from the TXA transmission tower on top of Mount Dandenong, Victoria, from a shared facility alongside commercial television networks. Prior to 1 March 2012, C31's signal was available in analog UHF at a lower power than Melbourne's other television stations (it was, for example, one quarter of SBS's output power). Nevertheless, viewers with good line-of-sight to the main transmitter on Mount Dandenong could receive a usable signal from as far away as Geelong, Castlemaine and Moe. Programming C31 broadcasts a vast array of locally produced content including news, sport, youth, arts, and entertainment programmes. The station also features a substantial amount of local multicultural programming, celebrating Melbourne's ethnic diversity. =FishCam= Fishcam is arguably C31's best-known programme. It was a pre-recorded broadcast of a fish tank located in the station's studios, set to music by independent artists.Application to the ABA for Melbourne Community Television \\"From midnight there is a live camera broadcasting...with music by independent artists playing in the background.\\" It used to be live, but the station got complaints from the ACMA when there was a dead fish floating on the top of the tank for several days. It was originally shown in place of a test pattern when the station had no programming available for broadcast. After it was discovered that Fishcam was reasonably popular, Fishcam became a scheduled show and was even listed in the TV guide. C31 has boasted that Fishcam is \\"very popular\\"Application to the ABA for Melbourne Community Television \\"Fishcam is a very popular and peaceful alternative to late night infomercials.\\" and is so widely recognised in the Melbourne community that \\"many people know C31 as 'the fish station'.\\"Channel 31's Former Fishcam Webpage (via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine) \\"Fishcam is one of Channel 31's most popular and recognised programs to the extent that many people know Channel 31 as 'the fish station'. To our knowledge, there is nowhere in the world where you can switch on your television to watch fish\\". The station has previously made VHS tapes of Fishcam available for purchase. After having its timeslot continually cut back over the years to make room for more traditional programming, Fishcam finally ceased broadcasting on 4 March 2007.C31 : Our Shows: Show Guide On 13 October 2014 FishCam returned at the new time of 9pm hosted by Luis from Lessons with Luis.

Hashes 0-0 and 0-1 are the hash values of data blocks L1 and L2, respectively, and hash 0 is the hash of the concatenation of hashes 0-0 and 0-1. In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of hash lists and hash chains. Demonstrating that a leaf node is a part of a given binary hash tree requires computing a number of hashes proportional to the logarithm of the number of leaf nodes of the tree; this contrasts with hash lists, where the number is proportional to the number of leaf nodes itself. The concept of hash trees is named after Ralph Merkle who patented it in 1979. Uses Hash trees can be used to verify any kind of data stored, handled and transferred in and between computers. They can help ensure that data blocks received from other peers in a peer-to-peer network are received undamaged and unaltered, and even to check that the other peers do not lie and send fake blocks. Hash trees are used in hash-based cryptography. Hash trees are also used in the IPFS, Btrfs and ZFS file systems (to counter data degradation); Dat protocol; Apache Wave protocol; Git and Mercurial distributed revision control systems; the Tahoe- LAFS backup system; Zeronet; the Bitcoin and Ethereum peer-to-peer networks; the Certificate Transparency framework; and a number of NoSQL systems such as Apache Cassandra, Riak, and Dynamo. Suggestions have been made to use hash trees in trusted computing systems. The initial Bitcoin implementation of Merkle trees by Satoshi Nakamoto applies the compression step of the hash function to an excessive degree, which is mitigated by using Fast Merkle Trees.Mark Friedenbach: Fast Merkle Trees Overview A hash tree is a tree of hashes in which the leaves are hashes of data blocks in, for instance, a file or set of files. Nodes further up in the tree are the hashes of their respective children. For example, in the picture hash 0 is the result of hashing the concatenation of hash 0-0 and hash 0-1. That is, hash 0 = hash( hash(0-0) + hash(0-1) ) where + denotes concatenation. Most hash tree implementations are binary (two child nodes under each node) but they can just as well use many more child nodes under each node. Usually, a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-2 is used for the hashing. If the hash tree only needs to protect against unintentional damage, unsecured checksums such as CRCs can be used. In the top of a hash tree there is a top hash (or root hash or master hash). Before downloading a file on a p2p network, in most cases the top hash is acquired from a trusted source, for instance a friend or a web site that is known to have good recommendations of files to download. When the top hash is available, the hash tree can be received from any non-trusted source, like any peer in the p2p network. Then, the received hash tree is checked against the trusted top hash, and if the hash tree is damaged or fake, another hash tree from another source will be tried until the program finds one that matches the top hash. The main difference from a hash list is that one branch of the hash tree can be downloaded at a time and the integrity of each branch can be checked immediately, even though the whole tree is not available yet. For example, in the picture, the integrity of data block L2 can be verified immediately if the tree already contains hash 0-0 and hash 1 by hashing the data block and iteratively combining the result with hash 0-0 and then hash 1 and finally comparing the result with the top hash. Similarly, the integrity of data block L3 can be verified if the tree already has hash 1-1 and hash 0. This can be an advantage since it is efficient to split files up in very small data blocks so that only small blocks have to be re-downloaded if they get damaged. If the hashed file is very big, such a hash tree or hash list becomes fairly big. But if it is a tree, one small branch can be downloaded quickly, the integrity of the branch can be checked, and then the downloading of data blocks can start. =Second preimage attack= The Merkle hash root does not indicate the tree depth, enabling a second-preimage attack in which an attacker creates a document other than the original that has the same Merkle hash root. For the example above, an attacker can create a new document containing two data blocks, where the first is hash 0-0 + hash 0-1, and the second is hash 1-0 + hash 1-1. One simple fix is defined in Certificate Transparency: when computing leaf node hashes, a 0x00 byte is prepended to the hash data, while 0x01 is prepended when computing internal node hashes. Limiting the hash tree size is a prerequisite of some formal security proofs, and helps in making some proofs tighter. Some implementations limit the tree depth using hash tree depth prefixes before hashes, so any extracted hash chain is defined to be valid only if the prefix decreases at each step and is still positive when the leaf is reached. =Tiger tree hash= The Tiger tree hash is a widely used form of hash tree.

In 1995, about 71% of Uzbekistan's population was Uzbek. The chief minority groups were Russians (8.4%), Tajiks (officially 5%, but believed to be much higher), Kazaks (4.1%), Tatars (2.4%), and Karakalpaks (2.1%), and other minority groups include Armenians and Koryo- saram. It is said however that the number of non-indigenous people living in Uzbekistan is decreasing as Russians and other minority groups slowly leave and Uzbeks return from other parts of the former Soviet Union. Heritage Cultural heritage sites in Uzbekistan inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List include: * Historic Centre of Bukhara (1993) * Historic Centre of Shakhrisyabz (2000) * Ichan Kala (1990) * Samarkand – Crossroads of Cultures (2001) Religion Mosque of Bukhara, Uzbekistan When Uzbekistan gained independence in 1991 it was widely believed that Muslim fundamentalism would spread across the region. The expectation was that an Islamic country long denied freedom of religious practice would undergo a very rapid increase in the expression of its dominant faith. In 1994 about more than half of Uzbeks were said to belong to Islam, though in an official survey few of that number had any real knowledge of the religion or knew how to practice it.

Education Uzbekistan has a high literacy rate with about 98% of adults above the age of 15 being able to read and write. However, with only 76% of the under 15 population currently enrolled in education this figure may drop in the future. Uzbekistan has encountered severe budgeting shortfalls in its education program. The education law of 1992 began the process of theoretical reform, but the physical base has deteriorated, and curriculum revision has been slow ... Traditions Uzbeks celebrate the New Year in a celebration called Yangi Yil. They decorate a Christmas tree, They celebrate Christmas, and give each other gifts. They sing and listen to traditional Uzbek music while having dinner, and after dinner, a man dressed as Santa and Father Time arrive and continue the celebration. At midnight, they sing the Uzbek National Anthem to welcome a new year, and continue celebrating.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sie7rccqQY8 Moreover, the most popular holiday for Uzbeks is Nowruz, and it is deemed to be the most historical one. Colourful traditional costumes and variety of meals on the laid table take the main pattern of the holiday. However, the main course of the holiday is Sumalak, which should be boiled the whole night. Cuisine Palov, the national dish in Uzbekistan tandir oven Uzbek cuisine is influenced by local agriculture, as in most nations. There is a great deal of grain farming in Uzbekistan, so breads and noodles are of importance, and Uzbek cuisine has been characterized as \\"noodle-rich\\". Mutton is a popular variety of meat due to the abundance of sheep in the country and it is part of various Uzbek dishes. Uzbekistan's signature dish is palov (plov or osh), a main course typically made with rice, pieces of meat, and grated carrots and onions. Oshi Nahor, or Morning Plov, is served in the early morning (between 6 and 9 am) to large gatherings of guests, typically as part of an ongoing wedding celebration. Other notable national dishes include: shurpa (shurva or shorva), a soup made of large pieces of fatty meat (usually mutton) and vegetables; norin and lagman, noodle-based dishes that may be served as a soup or a main course; manti, chuchvara, and somsa, stuffed pockets of dough served as an appetizer or a main course; dimlama (a meat and vegetable stew) and various kebabs, usually served as a main course. Green tea is the national hot beverage taken throughout the day; teahouses (chaikhanas) are of cultural importance. The more usual black tea is preferred in Tashkent, both green and black teas are typically taken without milk or sugar. Tea always accompanies a meal, but it is also a drink of hospitality, automatically offered green or black to every guest. Ayran, a chilled yogurt drink, is popular in summer, but does not replace hot tea. The use of alcohol is less widespread than in the west, but wine is comparatively popular for a Muslim nation as Uzbekistan is largely secular. Uzbekistan has 14 wineries, the oldest and most famous being the Khovrenko Winery in Samarkand (est. 1927). The Samarkand Winery produces a range of dessert wines from local grape varieties: Gulyakandoz, Shirin, Aleatiko, and Kabernet likernoe (literally Cabernet dessert wine in Russian). Uzbek wines have received international awards and are exported to Russia and other countries in Central Asia. The choice of desserts in Bukharan Jewish and Uzbek cuisines are limited. A typical festive meal ends with fruit or a compote of fresh or dried fruit, followed by nuts and halvah with green tea. A Bukharan Jewish specialty for guests on a Shabbat afternoon is Chai Kaymoki - green tea mixed, contrary to the standard Uzbek practice, with a generous measure of milk (in 1:1 proportions) and a tablespoon of butter in the teapot. The tea is sometimes sprinkled with chopped almonds or walnuts before serving. Sport Djamolidine Abdoujaparov is the most famous cyclist in Uzbekistan, winning three Tour de France point contests. Abdoujaparov is also one of the world's fastest cyclists. Uzbekistan is home to former racing cyclist Djamolidine Abdoujaparov. Abdoujaparov has won the points contest in the Tour de France three times, each time winning the coveted green jersey. The green jersey is second only to the yellow jersey. Abdoujaparov was a specialist at winning stages in tours or one day races when the bunch or peloton would finish together. He would often 'sprint' in the final kilometer and had a reputation as being dangerous in these bunch sprints as he would weave side to side in a sprint. This reputation earned him the nickname 'The Terror of Tashkent'. Artur Taymazov won Uzbekistan's first wrestling medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics, as well as two gold medals at both the 2004 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics in Men's 120 kg. Ruslan Chagaev is a professional boxer representing Uzbekistan in the WBA. He won the WBA champion title in 2007, after defeating Russian Nikolai Valuev. Chagaev defended his title twice before losing it to Vladimir Klitschko in 2009. Uzbekistan is the home of the International Kurash Association. Kurash is an internationalized and modernized form of the traditional Uzbek fighting art of Kurash. Football is the most popular sport in Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan's premier football league is the Uzbek League, which features 16 teams. The current champions are FC Bunyodkor, and the team with the most championships is FC Pakhtakor Tashkent with eight. The current player of the year (2010) is Server Djeparov. Uzbekistan regularly participates in the AFC Champions League and the AFC Cup. Nasaf won AFC Cup in 2011, which is the first international club cup for Uzbek football. Before Uzbekistan's independence in 1991, the country used to be part of the Soviet Union football, rugby union, ice hockey, basketball, and handball national teams. After Uzbekistan got split up from the Soviet Union, Uzbekistan created its own football, rugby union, and futsal national teams. Other popular sports in Uzbekistan include rugby union, handball, baseball, ice hockey, basketball, and futsal.

His films are notable for their focus on ordinary events and the natural setting rather than on adventures and antics. Many of his early film writings for French newspapers were collected in the volume Cinema et cie (1919). He also wrote one of the first books on Charlie Chaplin (1921; translated into English in 1922). Delluc directed his seventh film, L'Inondation (The Flood), in 1924.

It is located on the Wongan Hills to Mullewa railway line which was opened in 1915. Perenjori was approved as the name of a siding in April 1913, and later that year the government decided to establish a townsite there. Perenjori townsite was gazetted in 1916. In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding.  Overview  Perenjori is the Aboriginal name of a nearby water source, Perenjori Rockhole being first recorded in 1911 when land was set aside for a water reserve at the rockhole. The rockhole was sometimes spelt Perengory or Perangery, and it is believed the name may be derived from the Peranj-jiddee bush which surrounded the rockhole. The bush is similar to the Black Wattle. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. A bulk wheat bin was constructed in the town in January 1940 which is capable of holding about 220,000 bushels. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.  History  Dan Woodall was the first permanent settler in the areas. He came to the area in 1905 to manage Perangery Station, then owned by the Lee Steere family. In 1906 the four Farrell brothers came to the area to take up land. The Lands Department approved agricultural lots of 1000 acres instead of the large pastoral leases which had been granted in the past. Perenjori was declared a town on 16 February 1916.  Tourism  Perenjori is on the Wildflower Way a tourist drive that runs from Dalwallinu to Geraldton. Late August to October is the wildflower season and depending upon the season the countryside may be alive with flowers including orchids, carpets of white, pink and yellow everlastings and the unique wreath leschenaultia.  Transport  In 2008, WestNet will be building a loading point for iron ore traffic. Iron ore will be hauled by road from Mount Gibson, loaded onto railway wagons for haulage to Geraldton where ships of up to 60,000 DWT are loaded. In 2011 the loader was expected to be completed.

The ema are left hanging up at the shrine, where the kami (spirits or gods) are believed to receive them. Typically 15 cm wide and 9 cm high, they often carry images or are shaped like animals, or symbols from the zodiac, Shinto, or the particular shrine or temple. In ancient times people would donate horses to the shrines for good favor; over time this was transferred to a wooden plaque with a picture of a horse, and later still to the various wooden plaques sold today for the same purpose. Once inscribed with a wish, Ema are hung at the shrine until they are ritually burned at special events, symbolic of the liberation of the wish from the writer.  History  In some early Shinto and folk traditions of Japan, horses were seen to carry messages from the kami, and usually used to transmit requests during droughts or famines. Horses were extremely expensive, and figures made of clay or wood have been found dating to the Nara period. The earliest text record of a substitution is from the Honcho bunsui from 1013, in which an offering of three paper horses is made at the Kitano Tenjin shrine. During the Kamakura period, the practice entered into Buddhist practice, as evidenced in painted scrolls of ema at Buddhist temples. The depictions of objects aside from horses can be traced to either the Muromachi or Tokugawa periods, beginning with larger sized ema (named ōema) but also representing new forms, such as ships. Artists of this period, such as Hokusai, began to create ema in distinct styles, and creating the objects became a professionalized craft. Today, they are mostly produced at or by the shrine or temple in which they are found. Some shrines have faced criticism for profiting from the sale of ema. In 1979, two shrines dedicated to education sold ema for examination success, transforming the funds into a scholarship in 1980 after public outcry.  Symbols  Dazaifu Tenmangu shrine in Fukuoka Prefecture. Historically, groups of farmers or small merchants could organize to hire a local artisan to create an ema to be donated to a shrine for a specific purpose, such as a good harvest. Archeological records suggest this could have been used to send political signals, as in the case of a Fukuoka Prefecture shrine that saw an increase in commissioned portraits depicting peaceful relations with Korea amidst tensions between the nations during the late 19th century. Ema can represent deities, such as Kannon and Jizō, but also more specific iconography depending on their intended purpose. These include depictions of a phallus or breasts for fertility prayers, or an octopus representing the desire to be cured of warts. Another example are sandals depicted on plaques for foot remedies. Another form of ema wish for \\"tie- cutting.\\" Whereas a man and woman standing beside a palm tree is interpreted as a wish for a long relationship, another plaque depicts nettles between the couple, wishing for divorce. Common symbolism also includes nettles placed beside an object one wishes to sever ties with. During wartime, ema depicting the same man, one in military uniform and one in civilian clothing, suggested a desire for a soldier to sever from his civilian life. For some, the same image may have been used to express a wish to avoid military service altogether. The use of text has gradually replaced the overt use of symbolism in contemporary ema. The rise of literacy has encouraged guests to write their own messages, which has dramatically decreased the use of distinct ema as a way to transmit a specific wish. Function As a ritual, the ema is a means to communicate wishes to both priests and the kami. The public nature of the ema, which are displayed at shrines before their ritual burning, also serves a social function for communicating to the community that an individual has made the wish. Burning the wishes helps to \\"symbolically liberate\\" the spirit of the wish into the world. In some cases, however, wishes are taken from the shrine to be hung at home, though still ritually burned in special ceremonies.

Career  Originally laid down in 1757 as the 90-gun Impétueux, she was funded by the City of Paris and renamed Ville de Paris in 1762 as a result of the don des vaisseaux, Duc de Choiseul’s campaign to raise funds for the navy from the cities and provinces of France. She was completed in 1764 as a 90-gun first rate, just too late to serve in the Seven Years' War. She was one of the first three-deckers to be completed for the French navy since the 1720s. In 1778, on the French entry into the American Revolutionary War she was commissioned at Brest, joining the fleet as the flagship of Guichen. In July she fought in the indecisive Battle of Ushant (1778). At some point during the next two years, she had an additional 14 small guns mounted on her previously unarmed quarterdeck, making her a 104-gun ship. In 1779, she was the flagship of a division under Duchaffault, part of the Armada of 1779. In March 1781 she sailed for the West Indies as flagship of a fleet of 20 ships of the line under De Grasse. She then fought at the Battle of Fort Royal and the Battle of the Chesapeake, under Captain Cresp de Saint-Césaire. In 1782, she fought in the Battle of St. Kitts as De Grasse's flagship. At the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782, the British fleet under Admiral Sir George Rodney defeated the French fleet under the Comte de Grasse, and captured Ville de Paris. No longer capable of sailing, with no masts and no rudder, the stricken ship was towed by HMS Namur after the battle, being taken to Port Royal, Jamaica for repair.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.160 The ship sank in September 1782 with other ships including HMS Glorieux when the 1782 Central Atlantic hurricane hit the fleet off Newfoundland Admiral Graves was leading back to England.

David Dixon Porter's Mortar Flotilla, Henry Janes was fitted with a mortar and proceeded to rendezvous with the other vessels under Porter's command at Key West, Florida. With the flotilla formed by the end of February, it sailed to join the West Gulf Blockading Squadron for the Mississippi River operations specifically aimed at the capture of New Orleans, Louisiana. Henry Janes and the other ships passed over the bar and into the Mississippi River 18 March in preparation for the attack on Fort Jackson and Fort St. Phillip. Below New Orleans, Louisiana, the mortars opened fire on the forts 18 April and kept up a steady and devastating bombardment until Flag Officer David Farragut passed with his fleet 24 April, defeated the Confederate Squadron, and steamed triumphantly to New Orleans, Louisiana. The loss of this great shipping center, largest and wealthiest city in the South, was a disaster from which the South had no hope of recovery. = Mississippi River operations = After thus aiding in the key victory at New Orleans, the mortar schooners returned to Ship Island, Mississippi, 6 May. There they remained until they were called upon to aid in the bombardment of another Confederate stronghold -- Vicksburg, Mississippi. Arriving below the city 20 June, Henry Janes and the other ships supported Farragut with their fire as he passed the batteries 28 June to join with Commodore C. H. Davis farther up the river. The ships remained off Vicksburg in July and Henry Janes bombarded the city's defenses on the 15th, before proceeding downriver, engaging shore batteries as she went. = Patrolling the coast of Texas = Assigned to the blockading forces off the coast of Texas, the schooner's next action, at Sabine Pass, was against Confederate batteries near Sabine City. The Union Navy vessels entered the pass 21 September and forced the defenders to evacuate their fortifications 4 days later. Although Sabine City was captured, the Union Navy could dominate only the waters in the area as no occupying troops were available. Henry Janes returned to blockading duties, with occasional boat expeditions into the innumerable passes and inlets of the Texas coast. On one such expedition, 20 November 1862, an entire boat crew from the schooner was captured by Confederates at Matagorda Bay. = End-of-war operations = For the next 18 months, Henry Janes performed blockade and gunfire duties at various stations of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. She was below Port Hudson in June 1863 and from February to May 1864 operated off Fort Powell, near Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida. She was sent to New York 5 May 1864 for repairs to her hull and replacement of her mortar. The ship was subsequently turned over to the ordnance department 8 August, and assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron as an ordnance vessel.  Post-war decommissioning and sale  Henry Janes sailed from New York 30 August to report in the sounds of North Carolina on ordnance duty. She remained there until sent north in June 1865, decommissioned 12 July 1865, and was sold to George Burnham, Jr., 20 July 1865 at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

Assembly"},{"id":"2497437","text":"Shelley Unwin (also Barlow) is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, Coronation Street, played by Sally Lindsay. She is the daughter of Bev Unwin (Susie Blake). Shelley's storylines included a bigamous marriage to Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and an abusive and controlling relationship with Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward), who later left her pregnant. Storylines Shelley comes to the rescue when they are short-staffed at The Rovers. She worked behind the club bar when Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe) was playing for Weatherfield Rugby League Club and they became good friends so she is devastated when Duggie dies on a building site in February 2002. In the pub, Shelley proves to be a popular barmaid. After Fred Elliott (John Savident) buys the pub, Shelley and colleague Geena Gregory (Jennifer James) compete for the position of bar manager. Shelley gets the job and Geena resents this. Shelley settles into the job quite well, though does tend to be a bit too lenient with the staff. Her best friend is Sunita Parekh (Shobna Gulati), who works at the corner shop. Shelley falls in love with Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) after he leaves the navy and returns to the Street over Christmas 2001. They move into the flat over the bookies on Rosamund Street together and Peter buys the bookies. They have a rough patch and break up for a while after Peter's friend, Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy), visits and makes a pass at Shelley. She doesn't tell Peter initially but when he does finds out, Ciaran blames Shelley. Peter gets very jealous and Shelley, hurt that Peter didn't believe her, leaves. Once Peter realizes that Ciaran is lying, Peter ends the friendship and he and Shelley reconcile. Ciaran returns to Weatherfield for Peter and Shelley's engagement party and stays, much to Shelley's chagrin. Peter and Ciaran renew their friendship and Shelley accepts it but never really trusts Ciaran, who later gets engaged to Sunita. Peter and Shelley move into the pub when Fred moves in with his son, Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) after the death of his wife, Maxine (Tracy Shaw), but Peter is secretly dating another woman, Lucy Richards (Katy Carmichael), who gets pregnant. Peter tries to tell Shelley but never manages it as every opportunity is either interrupted or loses his nerve. Just as he is finally about to tell her, a week before he is due to marry Lucy, they learn that her sister, Sharon, has died. Peter marries Lucy on the day of Sharon's funeral but Lucy learns that Peter is still with Shelley and kicks him out. Peter, despite his marriage to Lucy, marries Shelley in July 2003. By the end of the summer, though, Shelley learns that Peter is married to Lucy and they have a baby son, Simon (Alex Bain). Shelley also throws Peter out and nurses a broken heart while trying to run the pub with her mother, Bev (Susie Blake). In January 2004, Shelley has an ill-fated date with Newton & Ridley drayman, Eric Gartside (Peter Kay). Eric tries his best to woo Shelley and takes her out for an expensive meal but when they go back to his house for a drink, she is put off by his mother, Dolly. Shelley tells Eric that he is a lovely man but she doesn't think things would work out between them. Shelley then starts seeing builder Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward), despite his previous relationship with her mother and unaware that Charlie is still sleeping with Bev behind her back. Bev decides to tell Shelley the truth but Charlie makes sure that Shelley doesn't believe her. Shelley is hurt and frustrated by her mother's constant lies and interference and kicks her out of The Rovers. Devastated that her daughter could believe Charlie over her, Bev leaves Weatherfield but on her return, Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) is offered a job and a room at The Rovers by Fred. Shelley and Liz don't get on as Shelley had hired Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) to fill the position left by Bev but Fred insists that Liz gets the job and his choice is final. Charlie soon makes a move on Liz but she pushes him away and tells Shelley, who, true to form, believes Charlie's version of events again. He also persuades Shelley to insist that Liz is sacked, so she leaves Weatherfield briefly to visit Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) in Brighton. Charlie and Shelley's relationship continues to seem perfect to Shelley and the other Street residents. When Liz returns, she is reinstated at The Rovers and Charlie tries making a move on her again so Liz doesn't stay, taking a job at the Weatherfield Arms instead. After Liz has left, Shelley gets more and more worried about Charlie cheating. The height of this comes when a drunken Shelley confronts Gail Platt (Helen Worth), who she thinks is having an affair with Charlie. Shelley yells drunkenly at Gail, to which Gail famously replies: \\"Just go home and sleep it off, you silly girl!\\", and tells Shelley that Charlie is doing some building work for her. Shelley is ashamed and Charlie tells her that she is stupid. Shelley apologises and he forgives her. After Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar) burns down Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) grocery shop empire, Shelley thinks that as they are friends, and that Charlie could rebuild Dev's shops. Over dinner at Dev and Sunita's flat, Shelley suggests to Dev that Charlie could do the job for mates' rates and he could start as soon as possible, as he doesn't have much work at the moment. Charlie is furious about this and tells Shelley that she has made him look like a fool so Shelley apologises again. In December 2004, Shelley gets in touch with her mother and they arrange to meet for lunch. Shelley tells Charlie that she is going to a Newton & Ridley Christmas party but he phones the brewery to check and learns that there is no party, making him suspicious. He confronts Shelley who is evasive initially but when Charlie accuses her of seeing another man, she admits that she visited Bev and intends to meet her again. Charlie then insists Shelley phone Bev and tell her that she doesn't want to see her any more. Charlie continues to put Shelley down, and after every phone call, he accuses her of talking to her mother. A few weeks later, Bev visits No. 1 and asks Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) to pop next door and fetch Shelley because they need to talk. Shelley lies that everything is fine with Charlie and does her best to convince Bev it is true but Bev asks Deirdre to keep an eye on Shelley as she isn't convinced. For New Year 2004, Charlie buys Shelley a new dress but it is two sizes too small. Charlie pretends to be upset that he has got the wrong size, but hints that instead exchanging it, Shelley should go on a diet. Shelley is upset and tells him to get the dress changed but Charlie gives it to Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), who gives it to his girlfriend, Violet Wilson (Jenny Platt). Shelley is humiliated when Violet comes to work, wearing the dress and makes a scene in front of a pub full of regulars. In the end, Charlie gets his own way again when Shelley decides that it would be a good idea to lose a bit of weight. Charlie slowly isolates Shelley until she ends up hiding in her bedroom for several months and pushes away all her friends, including Ciaran, who leaves Weatherfield. Shelley thinks plastic surgery on her eyes would make her feel more confident so Charlie pays for it. She then suggests they get married and Charlie agrees, but wanting her to feel confident enough to walk down the aisle, he gets her a counsellor called Zack (Ralph Ineson) because she is also retreating from him. However, this backfires when Zack gives Shelley the confidence she needs to start standing up to him. He tries to fire Zack but this seems to be the final push Shelley needs. She and Charlie both go to the church, via a night with another woman, in Charlie's case but Shelley jilts him at the altar and walks home, head held high. She throws Charlie out of the pub and starts rebuilding her life and her friendships. After Bev agrees to marry Fred, Shelley starts to feel more left out and overshadowed in the pub when Bev starts taking over as landlady before the wedding. Shelley decides she needs a fresh start and gets a job at a country pub in the Peak District but has a one-night stand with Charlie before she leaves, returning later to discuss wedding arrangements and, when Bev confronts her about her not drinking alcohol, she admits that she is pregnant with Charlie's baby. Bev suggests Shelley have a termination but she refuses and insists that Bev keep this secret as she does not want Charlie to know. Bev, needing to talk to someone, tells Deirdre who is horrified because Charlie is now dating her daughter, Tracy (Kate Ford). Deirdre insists she is going to tell Tracy and Tracy confronts her, demanding that Shelley admit she is lying but Tracy realizes it is true and tells Charlie, demanding that he make Shelley have a termination. Shelley almost gets away without seeing Charlie but he confronts her. She insists she will keep the baby and never tell the child anything about him or ask him for a penny but he doesn't believe her. Creation and development In January 2001 it was announced that a new barmaid and friend of Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe) was to join and that she would be played by actress Sally Lindsay. She made her first appearance on the soap on 9 May 2001 as a new feisty barmaid. During Shelley's six years on the show she was friends with Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) and was involved in high-profile storylines such as discovering her husband Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) is a bigamist and later being beaten up by her then boyfriend Charlie Stubbs (Bill Ward). In October 2005, it was announced that Lindsay had quit Coronation Street after six years playing Shelley. Speaking of her departure Lindsay said \\"I think that Shelley has been through so much as a character during my time here, and I am really looking forward to working on different projects. I have and always will have a massive affection for Coronation Street, and I want to thank all the cast, production team and writers for everything that has happened for me and my character.\\" Producer Tony Wood praised her as a \\"talented actress\\" and paid tribute to her portrayal of Shelley's mental abuse at the hands of Charlie, played by Bill Ward. \\"Sally has been fantastic during her time on Coronation Street – she has done everything that has been asked of her and more,\\" he said. In January 2010, asked whether she would consider returning Lindsay said \\"I never say never but there's too much going on in other parts of my career to even contemplate it. Once you are in the Street, you can't do anything else, you can't dip in and out of it, so it would have to be a massive commitment. I have lots of other things to do. I have had a lovely time since I left.\\" Discussing her decision to leave Shelley behind, Lindsay said: \\"It feels like a million years ago for me because I've never stopped. My heart was in it right until the end. I left before it wasn't. You can't really fake it with a character like Shelley. Leaving was a joint decision by me and Shelley because we'd been through enough.\\" Reception For her portrayal of Shelley, Lindsay was nominated in the category of \\"Best Actress\\" at The British Soap Awards 2005.

Then automatically, Meghalaya was formed by carving out two districts from the state of Assam: the United Khasi Hills and Jhada Hills, and the Garo Hills on 21 January 1972 after a fierce long struggle. People refer him as \\"Ma-Hoping\\" out of love and respect. Now he is the current MLA of Nongstoin Constituency. The party as a whole won 4 seat in legislative Assembly as of 2012.

The town takes its name from Balingup Pool, located on the Balingup Brook which flows through the town. The name was first recorded by a surveyor in 1850, and is said to be derived from the name of Noongar warrior, Balingan. Other research by Noongar academic and researcher Len Collard has shown the name derives from the language, meaning \\"one that is situated there at this place\\".http://www.boodjar.sis.uwa.edu.au/_literature.../Nyungar_Boodjera_Wangkiny The town is on the South Western Highway. It originally had a station on the railway line, opened in 1898, the same year the town was gazetted. Balingup was known in the twentieth century for fruit and vegetable growing, and more recently for beef cattle and \\"magic mushroom\\" farming. There are two long- established religious communities. Balingup hosts annual rural festivals, primarily the Small Farm Field Dayhttp://balingupsmallfarmfieldday.com.au/ (late April) and Medieval Carnivalehttp://www.balingupmedievalcarnivale.com.au/ (August). Nearby are found mushroom varieties of interest to both drug users and law enforcement agencies.Vines, Russell & Blake, Paul (1998).

For Acts passed during the period 1707–1800 see List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain. See also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, the List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland to 1700, and the List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, 1701–1800. For Acts passed from 1801 onwards see List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. For Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999, the List of Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the List of Acts and Measures of the National Assembly for Wales; see also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. For medieval statutes, etc. that are not considered to be Acts of Parliament, see the List of English statutes. The number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \\"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \\"41 Geo. 3\\" rather than \\"41 Geo. III\\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \\"41 Geo. 3\\". Acts passed by the Parliament of England did not have a short title; however, some of these Acts have subsequently been given a short title by Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (such as the Short Titles Act 1896). Acts passed by the Parliament of England were deemed to have come into effect on the first day of the session in which they were passed. Because of this, the years given in the list below may in fact be the year before a particular Act was passed.

Description  Group of plants Inflorescence Orchis purpurea reaches on average of height. The leaves are broad and oblong-lanceolate, forming a rosette about the base of the plant and surrounding the flower spike. They are fleshy and bright green, and can be up to 15 cm long. The inflorescence is densely covered with up to 50 flowers. The sepals and upper petals are violaceous or purple (hence the Latin name purpurea of the species). The flower's labellum is pale pink or white, with a center spotted by clusters of violaceous or purple hairs. It is divided into three lobes; the outer two are small and narrow, and the inner is large, rounded, and heart-shaped. Flowering occurs in late April to June.  Range and habitat  This orchid can be found in most parts of Europe, northern Africa, Turkey and the Caucasus. It usually grows in sloping woodlands, particularly in mixed deciduous / oak forests, but occasionally occur in meadows. It prefers limestone or chalk soil and partially shaded locations at an altitude of above sea level. = Identification = Orchis purpurea may be mistaken for the military orchid (Orchis militaris) or monkey orchid (Orchis simia). The three species often hybridize, making them difficult to identify, although the shape of the labellum is distinct to each species.

He is the founder of the Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party (JKNPP), a political organisation based in the conflict-torn Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. He survived an assassination attempt by the senior superintendent of police, while leading the Jammu student protests of 1966, and went on to found the Panthers Party in 1982, along with his wife Jay Mala. Bhim Singh was Panthers Party chairman for 30 years, until 2012 when he nominated his nephew Harsh Dev Singh in place. In the 2002 Jammu and Kashmir Elections, Panthers Party under his leadership won all seats in the Udhampur district, and formed part of the coalition government. In 2015, Bhim Singh's book Unbelievable - Delhi to Islamabad, was released by Indian vice-president Ansari, chronicling his efforts as a Supreme Court advocate, gaining the release of over 700 falsely accused prisoners, from Indian and Pakistani jails. He is believed to be the first man from India to visit 150 countries, and the second volume of his book documenting these travels, Peace Mission: Around the World on Motorcycle, was released by Dr. Karan Singh the erstwhile crown prince of Jammu and Kashmir. Bhim Singh was elected member of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly (1977–87) from Chenani-Ghordi (Udhampur), and was nominated by successive Prime Ministers of India as member of the National Integration Council (1991-2016). Bhim Singh, as leader of the Panthers Party, won the 1988 Udhampur by-election to the Indian parliament, despite the Election Commission of India, attempting to rig it against him. In 1988, future Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, joined Bhim Singh on hunger strike in front of the Election Commission offices, in protest to the election they rigged against him, in order to prevent him from joining the Indian Parliament. The Jammu and Kashmir High Court ruled in favour of Bhim Singh, judging that he had won the Lok Saba by-election from Udhampur, a seat previously held by his kinsman Karan Singh, former Crown prince of Jammu and Kashmir and its first President. Bhim Singh has held several key posts in the Indian Youth Congress, such as Vice-president (1977–78), General Secretary (1974–76) and President of Jammu and Kashmir State Youth Congress (1973–74) appointed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

The order of compensation from his case would change the tort law in India. While his 1996 efforts in moving the Supreme Court and the Election Commission, are seen as instrumental in returning democratic elections after nine years of absence to militancy torn Jammu and Kashmir. In 2017, Bhim Singh in a historic judgment, defeated the government of India in the Supreme Court, enabling bar council elections to be held in Jammu and Kashmir for the very first time, in accordance to the Advocates Act 1961. Bhim Singh was born in the village of Bhugterian, near Ramnagar, and is a descendant of the Wazir and General Zorawar Singh, referred to by historians as \\"Conqueror of Ladakh\\" and \\"Napoleon of India\\" for his 19th century conquests of the Himalayan Kingdoms of Ladakh, Tibet and Baltistan. While his Dogra Rajput dynasty, is believed to be descended from the mythical Ikshvaku (Solar) dynasty that in Eastern religious scriptures has produced personalities such as Lord Rama, Gautama Buddha, and twenty-two out of the twenty-four Jain Tirthankaras. Despite his Hindu royal and religious histories, Prof. Bhim Singh has politically and through the judiciary fought for democracy and secularism for over 55 years in Muslim majority Jammu and Kashmir, once described by President Bill Clinton as \\"the most dangerous place in the World.\\" In doing so Singh has spent 8 years in jail and endured militancy, Islamic extremism, terrorism and false arrests as consequence of the Jammu and Kashmir insurgencies and the ongoing Jammu and Kashmir armed conflict between India, Pakistan and China.

However, the Union Home Minister of India, Buta Singh had dispatched Dr. Bhalla, Secretary of the Election Commission by a Home Ministry aircraft to Jammu. Dr. Bhalla ordered the Returning Officer, S.P. Kazal to refer the count result to the Election Commission of India in New Delhi. On 25 June 1988 Peri Shastri the Chief Election Commissioner in New Delhi declared the Congress Party candidate Mohd. Ayub Khan instead as the winner by 2,376 votes. The Returning Officer was later found to have committed suicide with no known motive. Bhim Singh filed a review petition against the order of the Election Commission of India, stating the declared result was rigged at the instance of Rajiv Gandhi and Farooq Abdullah, leaders of the ruling coalition parties. Atal Behari Vajpayee joined Bhim Singh on hunger strike in front of the Election Commission offices in protest to the vote rigging. The Jammu and Kashmir High Court ruled in favour of Bhim Singh, however when Justice K.K. Gupta delivered the judgement four years later on 15 October 1992, the relevant session of parliament stood dissolved already.

He had attempted to do this by a petition filed on behalf of the Panthers Party calling for gubernatorial rule under section 92 of the Jammu and Kashmir constitution. While the Supreme Court denied Singh's petition after two weeks of curfew in the State, it called for a report by Prime Minister Modi's government on the matter. TS Thakur, the Chief Justice of India had requested solicitor general Ranjit Kumar to present a response to Singh's petition on the \\"ground realities\\" in the State.

However, Bhim Singh challenged the government's logic, arguing that if bar council elections could not be held in the state due to militancy, that it did would not have made sense to hold assembly and parliamentary elections either. = Poorest candidate in 2019 Indian General Election = In May 2019, Bhim Singh stood as a candidate for Indian parliament from Jammu, and was the poorest and oldest candidate in the constituency. At the time of the election he was over 78 years old and had just INR 30,000 ($420) cash, INR 16,000 ($224) bank deposit, and land valued at INR 38,000 ($533). He finished fourth out of 24 candidates, with 4,016 votes (0.27%). Controversies Defence of Saddam Hussein = Bhim Singh along with George Galloway, Natwar Singh and General Baig was a member of the Co-ordination Committee Against Economic Sanctions headed by Iraq's deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz. In 2005 he was called ‘Vishwa Ratna,’ as possibly the only person in the world who could refuse 7.3 million barrels of oil vouchers as illustrated in Table 3 of Vol.II in the report of the UN Committee dealing with Oil-for-food program headed by Paul Volcker during sanctions placed on Iraq. In essence saying no to oil vouchers that would have been worth over $500 million at the time of the Paul Volcker Committee report in 2005. Neither was he served notice to appear in front of the United Nations investigation on the matter. Bhim Singh says that he had also turned down a thick envelope stuffed with cash at the residence of the Iraqi ambassador in New Delhi, and that he only ever accepted a few token gifts from Saddam, like a bottle of fine alcohol and a Swiss Longines watch with the Ba'ath Party insignia on its dial . Later, Bhim Singh was named by Saddam as an advocate to plead his case in the Trial of Saddam Hussein, and set up the International Defence Committee for Saddam, leading a team of 11 lawyers. However, the United States blocked him from traveling to Baghdad. In 2006 at an UNI press conference he had stated that, \\"a dead Saddam can be more dangerous than a living Saddam for the US and UK... the execution may take a moment. But its consequences will be dangerous and long-term.\\" = Eviction notice from VP House = Bhim Singh was given guest accommodations at VP House in New Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir in 1991 for security reasons by Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar due to the threat posed to his life by terrorist groups in the Jammu and Kashmir Insurgency. In 2015, he was first asked to vacate his accommodation at VP House by the Urban Development Ministry and then given an 8-week eviction notice by the Supreme Court, questioning how he could have stayed as a guest for \\"30 years\\" at VP House which is usually meant for visitors of members of parliament. The television channel NewsX reported the story as an abuse of political power for luxury accommodation. Bhim Singh and his Panthers Party however protested the eviction at Jantar Mantar, stating that the accommodations were just a one room-suite used as offices to receive and assist Kashmiris with grievances. Bhim Singh believed that the eviction actions were politically motivated due his Party's opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-PDP coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir levying tax on Hindu pilgrims traveling to Vaishno Devi and civil- rights cases that he had pending in the Supreme Court on behalf of Pakistani refugees against the government. Earlier Bhim Singh and his Panther's Party had also protested the cut down of his 22 personnel Z security cover by the BJP-PDP government as an act of political discrimination. = Stance against CIA, ISI & Mossad = Bhim Singh has long alleged that the CIA, Mossad and ISI had become active in the 1970s to remove India's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from power and dissect Jammu and Kashmir away from under Indian administration. Singh who was named as a defence advocate by Slobodan Milosevic for his trial at the Hague claimed that \\"CIA has not learnt a lesson from the past and it wants to dissect India the way it did with USSR, Yugoslavia and elsewhere.\\" He continued to state that the 2015 coalition between the widely opposed views of the BJP and PDP had continued links to an ISI agenda to separate Jammu and Kashmir from India. Further alleging that the Hurriyat political party was in fact backed by Pakistan's ISI and acted as its agent in the state. Later, declassified documents from the CIA's Operation Cyclone (1979–1989), revealed that the CIA funded the Jihadi warriors, mujahideen through Pakistan and its ISI. It was the most expensive known covert operation conducted by the CIA, with over $20 billion spent on training and arming the militants. = Support for Gaddafi = In 2011, Bhim Singh who is also Chairman of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council appealed to the UN Security Council to intervene in the air-raids on Libya on the basis that they were against UN charter. Bhim Singh then visited Libya and encouraged Muammar Gaddafi to invoke democratic reforms at grass root levels. Afterwards he wrote an essay in support of Muammar Gaddafi and condemned his capture and subsequent death as \\"barbaric,\\" by rebels that he claimed were under a \\"US lead-NATO command.\\" Bhim Singh believed that a bloody civil war may result as consequence of tribal disputes post-Gaddafi, and that the bifurcation or trifurcation of Libya itself maybe on the US agenda for what he claimed would give a better hold over oil resources. He claimed Gaddafi had been on a US hit list as he had refused to join NATO and for his 1975 \\"Green Book\\" that had also put him in opposition to some other Arab leaders and Kings that the US was supporting. At the time Bhim Singh had also stated a need for a universal plan for democracy of all countries under the ruthless rule of Sheikhs, Kings, Sultans and Dictators. = Stance against Abdullah = Bhim Singh had alleged that his opposition Abdullah family were secret billionaires in an interview with NewsX TV channel, calling for a CBI investigation into the sudden death of Haji Yusuf in police custody. Yusuf linked to money corruption within the Abdullah's National Conference party had died in custody vomiting blood, after being detained for hours at the private residence of Omar Abdullah, the then Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. = Comparison to Fidel Castro = After a 1971 meeting with Fidel Castro in Cuba, Bhim Singh has long admired and praised his leadership. Bhim Singh himself has been criticized as a dictator in similar fashion to Castro for nominating individuals to office within his party without holding democratic elections.

The party was founded on 23 March 1982 by Prof. Bhim Singh and a few prominent youth political personalities of the time including Jay Mala, former President of the Indian Students Congress. Its aim is to \\"demolish corruption, communalism, criminalization, drug menace\\" and to establish a real democracy through ultimate revolution. Panthers Party campaigns for a further division of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, with the recognition of Hindu-majority Jammu Division as a new and separate state of India. In 1996 the party was notable in moving the Supreme Court and the Election Commission to return the democratic process to militancy-torn Jammu and Kashmir, when elections were held again in the state after a nine years hiatus. The party formed part of the coalition government of Jammu & Kashmir along with the Congress and PDP after the 2002 Jammu & Kashmir elections, winning all seats in the Udhampur district, with Harsh Dev Singh serving as education minister in the cabinet, and Yash Paul Kundal as the minister of animal and sheep husbandry. The party is a strong proponent of secular values in Jammu & Kashmir and across the region plagued by the terrorist insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. As a strong advocate of women's rights the Panthers Party women's wing works to protect women from domestic abuse in Jammu and Kashmir and female foeticide. The Women Panthers have called for a 33% reservation of seats for women in the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly. Prof. Bhim Singh who is locally known as Sher-e-Jammu (Lion of Jammu) is the party's Chief Patron and served as the Panthers Party chairman for 30 years till 2012, when his nephew Harsh Dev Singh became Chairman. Balwant Singh Mankotia has served as party's state President since 2010. The Panthers Party has been a long-time advocate of a sovereign statehood for Palestine. It strongly condemned Israel in reaction to the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid that left nine humanitarian aid workers dead, and called on the Indian central government to support Palestinians inside and outside the UN. In 2014, Panthers Party activists burned an effigy of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at protests held in New Delhi, calling for UN intervention under Chapter VII, and terming Israel's actions in Gaza as \\"genocide.\\" By December 2015, the Panthers Party's membership drive had reached a target of 100,000 members. Panthers Party, has fielded candidates in other Indian states, including Delhi in 2015, Uttarakhand in 2012, and in 2007 contested all MLA seats in Himachal Pradesh. In 2017, Panthers Party contested elections in Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh, and reconstituted its branch in Rajasthan, headed by Ashok Bapna. Panthers Party branch in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, is led by state president Naresh Ambedkar. In 2017, Qatar's state-funded Al Jazeera, and Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency, labelled the Panthers Party as a right-wing Hindu nationalist political party, for its billboard poster campaign, calling for an expulsion of Muslim refugees from Jammu. Party leader, Bhim Singh however, in an interview with Russia's state-owned news agency Sputnik, maintained a secular stance, and stated that the Rohingya refugees posed a security risk to both Muslims, and Hindus in Jammu. In 2017, Ankit Love, the son of Bhim Singh and Jay Mala, announced his candidacy for Prime Minister of India for the 2019 Indian general election. He became the party's leader on 28 May 2017.  History  Founding = The party was founded by Bhim Singh in 1982 as a split from the Indian National Congress. At the time, Bhim Singh was a member of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly with the Congress party. Bhim Singh had differences with the Congress party's alliance with the National Conference party of Sheikh Abdullah. In particular, the Panther's Party was founded in reaction to Sheikh Abdullah's Resettlement Act. The manifesto of the party focused on secular, nationalist and democratic principles, while seeking to respect the diversity of cultures and religions in the state including Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir. A month after its formation, in April 1982, the name of the party was questioned in the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly by Chief Minister, Sheikh Abdullah who had asked \\"Bhim Singh you were all right as a human being. Why you chose to be an animal?\\" Prof. Bhim Singh had then responded that \\"the people of State were terrorized by a big animal, known as Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir was Abdullah's nickname). They needed safety and protection from that lion. It was necessary to become an animal (Panther) to resist the lion.\\" = J&K; general elections, 1983 = On its formation in the 1983 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly elections the Panther's Party contested 50 seats in Jammu and Kashmir. The Panthers Party won only one seat, that of party founder Bhim Singh. He retained his seat with 7,690 votes (34.37%), a slender margin of 262 votes over his Congress Party rival. In reaction to his split from Congress, its ruling Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, had given Bhim Singh stiff opposition in his constituency of Chenani-Ghordi. In the neighbouring constituency of Udhampur, Panthers Party co-founder Jay Mala, placed third against sixteen other male candidates with 3,768 votes (13.75%), and polled the second most votes amongst all women candidates in the 1983 J&K; general elections. She was one of only seven female candidates that contested out of a total 512 candidates. = Indian general elections, 1984 = Bhim Singh stood in the 1984 general elections for Indian parliament, from the Udhampur constituency. He came second, to the Indian National Congress from which he had recently split to form the Panthers Party. He received 95,149 votes (26.24%). = Bhim Singh, MLA v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, 1985 = On 17 August 1985 Bhim Singh was suspended from the opening of the budget session of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly that was scheduled for 11 September. He subsequently challenged the suspension in the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. After his suspension was stayed by High Court on 9 September, Bhim Singh was illegally detained and arrested by the police en route to Srinagar. After attempts to locate him proved futile his wife and advocate Jay Mala then moved the court to locate Bhim Singh. The court ruled that there \\"certainly was a gross violation of Shri Bhim Singh's constitutional rights\\" and condemned the \\"authoritarian acts of the police.\\" The judges stated that they were in no doubt that the top levels of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir where ultimately responsible.Bhim Singh, MLA vs State Of J&K; And Ors. (Supreme Court 22 November 1985) (\\"There certainly was a gross violation of Shri Bhim Singh's constitutional rights under Articles 21 and 22(2).\\") Full Text The Supreme Court in a landmark judgement that impacted tort law in India, awarded Bhim Singh a compensation of fifty thousands rupees for his illegal detention and false imprisonment by the police. Bhim Singh had left jail with a fractured leg and claimed during his false imprisonment the police and state agencies had made an attempt on his life. = J&K; general elections, 1987 = Panthers Party in the 1987 J&K; general elections, contested 21 out of 76 seats for the legislative assembly.

However, the Union Home Minister of India, Buta Singh had dispatched Dr. Bhalla, Secretary of the Election Commission by a Home Ministry aircraft to Jammu. Dr. Bhalla ordered the Returning Officer, S.P. Kazal to refer the count result to the Election Commission of India in New Delhi. On 25 June 1988 Peri Shastri the Chief Election Commissioner in New Delhi declared the Congress Party candidate Mohd. Ayub Khan instead as the winner by 2,376 votes. The Returning Officer was later found to have committed suicide with no known motive. Bhim Singh filed a review petition against the order of the Election Commission of India, stating the declared result was rigged at the instance of Rajiv Gandhi and Farooq Abdullah, leaders of the ruling coalition parties. Atal Behari Vajpayee joined Bhim Singh on hunger strike in front of the Election Commission offices in protest to the vote rigging. The Jammu and Kashmir High Court ruled in favour of Bhim Singh, however when Justice K.K. Gupta delivered the judgement four years later on 15 October 1992, the relevant session of parliament stood dissolved already. Bhim Singh later wrote in his book, Murder of Democracy in Jammu and Kashmir, that he had intervened to pacify a crowd of his supporters at the time, despite it costing him the result. As he feared an outbreak of violence at the count venue could have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians, by the heavily armed police present there, due to an escalation of the insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. = Indian general elections, 1989 & 1991 = With his court battle still ensuing against the Election Commission over the rigging of the previous election, Bhim Singh contested again for the Panthers Party, from Udhampur in the 1989 Indian general elections.

He demanded a resolution against Pakistan who had condemned India's hanging of Parliament attack terrorist Afzal Guru. The month after in April 2013, Balwant joined another opposition disruption in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly condemning the death of Indian prisoner Chamel Singh in a Pakistani jail who had been allegedly tortured before his death. In May 2013, Panthers Party held another protest in the assembly demanding that chief minister Omar Abdullah resign, claiming his order was responsible for the deaths of five Central Reserve Police Force personnel in Srinagar.

A few days later on 28 August, Harsh Dev Singh lead protests disturbing proceedings in the assembly house with placards demanding that the word secular be inserted into the Jammu and Kashmir constitution to bring it to parity with the Constitution of India. In the protest they also claimed that the BJP who had recently come into power in the Indian national government in May 2014 were destroying the secular fabric of the country. In October 2014, party leader Bhim Singh heavily criticized BJP leader Narendra Modi's visit to Jammu and Kashmir, stating he was not \\"able to play the role of the prime minister,\\" and on his visit should have first met terrorism effected people as opposed to those effected by the recent 2014 Kashmir floods. In November 2014, he condemned the BJP as a party of \\"shop keepers\\" run from Nagpur by Hindu paramilitary group RSS. Next month in December, the Panthers party lost all their seats in the 2014 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly elections. Syed Mohammad Rafiq Shah remained as the sole Panthers Party representative in government until March 2015, as a Member of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Council. Earlier in April 2013, Shah had been marshalled out of the upper house after creating a ruckus in protest to discrimination against Urdu, an official state language.

Balwant Singh in reaction to the incident said \\"Israel should pullout its troops from Palestine and lift all barricades,\\" as he believed that \\"the settlement of Jewish community in Occupied Palestine is a grave threat to international peace and security.\\" The party at the time had called on the Indian central government to support the sovereign statehood of Palestine both in and outside the UN, stating that the USA and Israel were in violation of UN Resolution 181. = Indian general elections, 2014 = In the 2014 Indian general elections, Panthers Party fielded 13 candidates in Delhi, Punjab, Bihar, and Jammu and Kashmir.

On 22 August, while the court denied the party's attempt, it ordered the solicitor general to arrange a meeting between the Panthers Party leader, Bhim Singh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the issue. During the case Bhim Singh had stated that \\"pellet guns from Israel are used against the Kashmiris. This is a crime.\\" Three days later, Home Minister of India, Rajnath Singh traveled to Kashmir and met with a three-member delegation of the Panthers Party promising to end the use of pellet guns. On 19 September, Bhim Singh meet Narendra Modi for the first time since the latter had become Prime Minister.

Its creator, Deborah \\"Darby\\" Romeo, got its name from a dream she had about her husband Ben, a Frenchman she divorced not long into the magazine's run. Romeo would later write that during the magazine's early days Ben found the title amusing, and would introduce himself to people as \\"Ben, from Ben is Dead.\\" Beginnings The magazine began as a photocopied publication featuring interviews with punk and \\"alternative\\" rock bands of the era (including such then up-and-comers as Ethyl Meatplow, Nirvana and Hole) alongside the confessional and often shocking writing of Romeo, editors Mikki Halpin and Kerin Morataya, and her many contributors (which included such colorful personalities as Vaginal Davis, Ron Athey and Lisa Crystal Carver.) Starting with issue 10 (\\"Mother\\"), each issue had an overall theme (\\"Revenge,\\" \\"Obsessions and Bad Habits,\\" \\"Sex,\\" etc.) which the zine's writers would explore in exhaustive detail, freely recounting their own suicide attempts, kinky sexual adventures, addictions or family horror stories. The zine gradually became much more slick-looking and featured interviews with such mainstream acts as Tom Jones, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic and Duran Duran alongside underground notables like William S. Burroughs, Johnny Rotten and Anton LaVey. Eventually Ben Is Dead had a circulation in the tens of thousands and was being sold in Borders and Tower Records across the USA. Evolution As the zine continued, its tone became increasingly erratic as Romeo mixed the dark, confessional material with more light-hearted pop culture commentary, including articles about her fascination with Beverly Hills, 90210. Romeo's 90210 obsession eventually resulted in her and Morataya creating The I Hate Brenda Newsletter, a one-shot publication which was widely covered by the mainstream press. They also co-wrote the 1993 Pinnacle publication, The 'I Hate Brenda' Book and even formed their own band, Rump, which released a novelty compact disc entitled Hating Brenda. In the mid to late 1990s, Romeo was often interviewed by the mainstream media, serving as a rather ambivalent spokesperson for the zine movement; she once joked that unless she found a way to make her zine pay off, she was soon going to be doing CNN interviews from a cardboard box. Romeo was constantly embroiled in feuds with other zinesters, and her last known publishing project was Socially Fucking Retarded, a 2000 one-shot zine chronicling the KillZine tour she went on with various other zinesters and the controversies along the way. Romeo regularly interviewed her cantankerous father in Ben Is Dead, and in one interview she told him she couldn't imagine publishing a zine after she turned 30. And indeed, not long into her 30s, Romeo announced she was ceasing publication. The last issue of Ben is Dead featured the theme of \\"Celebrity.\\" Actor/artist/noted eccentric Crispin Glover appeared on the cover and was the subject of a lengthy and very peculiar interview. Today While the zine evolved quite a bit over the years, some things about it never changed - notably each issue being organized around a theme, the very small typeface used throughout (over the years the magazine printed many letters from readers complaining the font was so tiny it was hard to read) and the tiny quotations and commentary that ran along the bottom of almost every page. The zine attracted some notable fans, including Star Trek producer Brannon Braga, who sent in a fan letter. Many alternative cartoonists of the era (such as Adrian Tomine and Ellen Forney) were also fans, and contributed to the zine's penultimate, comics-themed issue. Today Ben Is Dead is perhaps best known for the three-part series of \\"Retro\\" issues, in which dozens of writers looked back at the trends and fads of their childhoods with a mix of nostalgia and horror. These issues were compiled into the sprawling book, Retro Hell: Life in the '70s and '80s, From Afros to Zotz. Early in the millennium, an anthology of Ben Is Dead articles was announced at Incommunicado Press, although the project eventually fell through. In 1996, Romeo established the University of California, Los Angeles' \\"Darby Romeo Collection of Zines,\\" a permanent archive currently housed in UCLA's Arts Library Special Collections. Many of Ben is Dead's writers have continued their writing careers (Vaginal Davis writes for LA Weekly, Lisa Crystal Carver and Mikki Halpin have each written several books, etc.) including Romeo, who has penned articles for LA Weekly, Alternative Press, Vanity Fair, The Chicago Tribune and The Village Voice among others. She currently maintains the blog Coconut Girl Wireless.

H. Lawrence. It was first published in 1925. The heroine of the story, Lou Witt, abandons her sterile marriage and a brittle, cynical post-First World War England. Her sense of alienation is associated with her encounter with a high- spirited stallion, the eponymous St Mawr. She eventually settles in a remote ranch set high in the mountains of New Mexico, near Taos. Lawrence wrote most of this brief novel whilst spending five months of the summer of 1924 at what is now known as the D. H. Lawrence Ranch, a property which he and wife, Frieda, acquired from Mabel Dodge Luhan earlier that year. St Mawr first appeared in St Mawr and Other Stories which, in addition to the novella, consists of two short stories 'The Overtone' and 'The Princess', and two unfinished stories 'The Wilful Woman' and 'The Flying Fish'. All these works were written during Lawrence's stay in America between 1922 and 1925.

It comprises a 576 m diameter circle of rectangular radio reflectors and a set of secondary reflectors and receivers, based at an altitude of 970 m. Each of the 895 2×7.4 m reflectors can be angled to reflect incoming radio waves towards a central conical secondary mirror, or to one of five parabolic cylinders. Each secondary reflector is combined with an instrumentation cabin containing various receivers and instruments. The overall effect is that of a partially steerable antenna with a maximum resolving power of a nearly 600 m diameter dish, when using the central conical receiver, making it the world's largest-diameter individual radio telescope. Operating modes The telescope can operate in three modes:The RATAN-600 Radio Telescope – Russian Academy of Science, Special Astrophysical Observatory * Two-mirror system: A sector of the ring focuses waves to the cylindrical secondary mirror which directs them onto the receivers. * Three- mirror system: The linear plane mirror reflects the waves to the south sector of the ring, which focuses them on a cylindrical secondary, that reflects them onto the receivers. This is a Kraus-type periscope mirror system. * Entire ring: For observations near the zenith, the entire ring can be used, together with the conical secondary mirror and its receivers. Simultaneous independent observations at various discrete azimuths are possible. For this, a sector of the ring is coupled with one of the secondary mirror-and-receiver units, which can be positioned using railway tracks, while another sector, in conjunction with another secondary mirror, is similarly used for an independent observation. Optical specifications It has a resolving power in the horizontal plane of 1 arcminute. At a wavelength of 8 cm, (3.75 GHz) the effective collecting area of the entire ring is which is 0.33% of that expected of a completely filled reflector of this size. Transit telescope The RATAN-600 is primarily operated as a transit telescope, in which the rotation of the Earth is used to sweep the telescope focus across the subject of observation. Radio frequency observations can be made in the frequency band 610 MHz to 30 GHz, though primarily in the centimetric waveband, with an angular resolution of up to 2 arcseconds. Observation of the Sun at radio wavelengths, in particular of the solar corona, has been a long-standing focus of the RATAN-600's scientific programme. It has also contributed to radio observation for the SETI project. The RATAN-600 has not suffered from the persistent technical problems of the neighbouring BTA-6, and has generally been in high demand since it began operation in mid-1974.  SETI candidate signal  On 15 May 2015, at 18:01:15.65 sidereal time, RATAN-600 detected a strong (0.75 Jansky) signal from the direction of HD164595. More specifically, the signal intensity rose and fell as the telescope panned past in a way that closely matched what would be expected for a distant source. Since the short wavelength (2.7 cm, or 11 GHz, in the X band) is unusual for a natural source of that power, after the researchers announced the signal in late August 2016 (in the form of a request for follow-up observations) there was a flurry of excitement that it might be a SETI candidate. Of course, the same artificial appearance also makes a terrestrial source likely. Because the signal is in a frequency band allocated to military use, it might have originated from a secret reconnaissance satellite. After further analysis, and a failure of other observatories to corroborate the signal, the Special Astrophysical Observatory concluded that it was of probably terrestrial origin. Later research suggests that it might have been a faulty satellite in a slow spin, as the frequency matches one used for inter-satellite beacons, but was more likely to be the downlink from an intact but classified satellite. https://www.space.com/secret-classified-satellite-trump-iran-tweet.html  References  Category:Radio telescopes Category:Buildings and structures in Karachay-Cherkessia Category:Soviet inventions ","title":"RATAN-600"},{"id":"2497499","text":"Signature of K R Gowri Amma K. R. Gouri Amma (born 7 July 1918)Kerala Legislative Assembly siteKerala Legislative Assembly old site is an Indian politician from Kerala. She is a communist revolutionary from Kerala. She is one of the founding leaders of the Communist movement in Kerala. She heads the Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy (JSS), a political party based in Kerala, India. Prior to the formation of JSS she was a prominent figure in the communist movement in Kerala. She was the first female law student coming from the Ezhava community. She was a Minister in the communist-led Ministries in Kerala in 1957, 1967, 1980, and 1987. She also became a Minister in the Congress-led Cabinet from 2001 to 2006. She is the second longest serving MLA in Kerala Legislative Assembly. Early life Gouri was born in Pattanakkad village, Cherthala in the Alappuzha district of Kerala as the seventh daughter of Arumuri Parambil Parvathi Amma and Kalathilparambil Raman in an aristocratic Ezhava family, Kalathilparambil - Arumuriparambil. She attended schools at Thuravoor and Cherthala and completed her college education at St. Teresa's College, Ernakulam and at Maharaja's College, Ernakulam. She also received a Law degree from Government Law College, Thiruvananthapuram.Her father was her inspiration through out her life,her family gave 132 acres of land to Kerala Government. Political life K. R. Gouri Amma was elected to the Travancore-Cochin Legislative Assembly in 1952 and 1954. In 1957 she was elected to the Kerala Legislative Assembly. Since then she has been continuously elected to the Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1960, '67, '70, '82, '87, '91, and 2001 and served as minister in various ministries. Gowri Amma was involved with the Kerala Karshaka Sangham from 1960 to 1984. She was also the leader of the Kerala Mahila Sangham from 1967 to 1976. =Early political life= She is one of the longest serving politicians in Kerala politics. Under the influence of elder brother and trade union leader Sukumaran, she entered the vibrant world of politics at a time when women hardly found themselves in politics. Starting her public life through trade union and peasant movements, Gauri was jailed on a number of occasions for participating in political activities. She was elected to the Travancore Council of Legislative Assembly in 1952 and 1954 with an overwhelming majority against sitting MLA, P. K. Raman. =Minister in the first ministry of Kerala State= Governor Burgula Ramakrishna Rao administers the oath to K. R. Gowri Amma as Minister for Revenue in 1957. She became Revenue Minister in the first communist ministry in 1957, headed by E. M. S. Namboodiripad (EMS). In the very same year she married T. V. Thomas, a prominent politician and also a minister in EMS' government. In the first Communist Ministry, K.R. Gouri Amma served as Minister for Revenue, Excise and Devaswom from April 1957 to July 1959. Council of Ministers (1957 - 59) After the split of Communist Party in 1964, K. R. Gauri joined the newly formed Communist Party of India (Marxist). But her husband, T. V. Thomas, stood with the Communist Party of India. This created fissures in their relationship and soon they parted owing to the differences in their political views. =Land Reforms bill in Kerala= The Land Reforms in Kerala is one the greatest achievements of Gowri Amma. It was she who piloted the revolutionary Land Reform Bill for the Communist Government. One of the first things the Communist Ministry did was to promulgate an Ordinance banning evictions of all tenants and kudikidappukar throughout the state. In due course a comprehensive Agrarian Relations Bill was drafted and piloted by the Minister for Revenue, K.R. Gouri Amma. The Bill sought to confer ownership rights on land to tenants including sharecroppers and fix a ceiling for the land a land owner could possess. It also had provisions for distributing the surplus land taken from the landlords to the landless poor. The vested interests rallied around them all kinds of reactionary, religious and communal forces and launched the so-called 'liberation struggle'. The Government was successful in passing the Agrarian Relations Bill in the Assembly before it was dissolved, but the Bill failed to get the President's assent. The 1960–'64 United Front Government (anti- Communist) prepared a new Land Reform Bill giving several concessions to the landlords and taking away many of the benefits conferred upon the peasants in the Agrarian Relations Bill. The people of Kerala and K.R. Gowri Amma had to wait for another ten years before a Land Reform Bill abolishing landlordism and giving land to the tillers was passed and fully implemented. =Minister in the 2nd E. M. S. Namboodiripad Ministry= In 1967 elections the Left Democratic Front Government under the Chief Minister-ship of E.M.S. Namboodiripad came to power. In it, K.R. Gowri Amma served as Minister for Revenue, Sales Tax, Civil Supplies, Social Welfare and Law from March 1967 to October 1969. She moved a number of progressive and radical amendments to the Land Reforms Bill passed by the previous Government. When it was implemented, landlordism was abolished in Kerala. 3.5 million tenants and about 500,000 Kudikidappukar were made owners of their land. More than one lakh acres of land was declared as surplus land and was distributed among the agro-labourers in rural areas. =Minister in first E. K. Nayanar ministry= From 25 January 1980 – 20 October 1981 K.R. Gowri Amma was made Minister for Agriculture, Social Welfare, Industries, Vigilance and Administration of Justice Minister in the First E. K. Nayanar ministry. =Minister in the second E. K. Nayanar ministry= In the Second E. K. Nayanar ministry (1996–2001) also she was made Minister for Industries and Social Welfare, Vigilance and Administration of Justice. During the 1987 elections she was projected as the candidate for Chief-ministership. But when the Ministry was formed she was sidelined and later ousted from the Communist Party (Marxist) in 1994. =Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy= In 1994 she was expelled from CPI (M). Following this she established a new political outfit named Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy (JSS). JSS went on to join the United Democratic Front, the arch- rivals of the Left Democratic Front to which CPI (M) belongs. K. R. Gowri Amma in office of Minister for Agriculture in 2001 =Minister in third A. K. Antony ministry = She served as the Minister of Agriculture in the third A. K. Antony ministry (17 May 2001 – 29 August 2004) =Minister in first Oommen Chandy ministry= Oommen Chandy was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Kerala on 31 August 2004 after the controversial resignation of A. K. Antony on 29 August. Gowri Amma served as the Minister of Agriculture, Soil Conservation, Soil Survey, Warehousing Corporation, Diary Development, Milk Co-operatives, Agricultural University, Animal Husbandry, Coir in the first Oommen Chandy ministry ( 31 August 2004 – 12 May 2006 ) also. =Positions held= K.R.Gouri Amma has been associated with numerous social and political movements: * President of Kerala Karshaka Sangam from 1960 to 1984. * President of Kerala Mahila Sangam from 1967 to 1976. * Secretary of Kerala Mahila Sangam from 1976 to 1987. * Secretariat Member of CPI State Committee. * Established the Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy (JSS), in 1994. * General Secretary of Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy.

He is a professor emeritus of the University of British Columbia, where his studies center on psychopathology and psychophysiology. Hare developed the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL- Revised), used to assess cases of psychopathy. He advises the FBI's Child Abduction and Serial Murder Investigative Resources Center (CASMIRC) and consults for various British and North American prison services. Life and career Hare was born in 1934 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Hare's father was a roofing contractor and his mother was of French Canadian descent. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood of Calgary. Hare attended the University of Alberta for a Bachelor of Arts degree which ended up 'more by default' with an emphasis on psychology. In 1959 he married Averil Hare whom he met in an abnormal psychology class, and a year later, their daughter, Cheryl, was born. In 1960, Hare completed a Master of Arts in psychology at the University of Alberta. He then moved to the USA to study for a PhD program in psychophysiology at the University of Oregon, but due to his daughter falling ill the family returned to Canada.Researchers: Hare - Area: Abnormal - Affiliation: University of British Columbia The Great Canadian Psychology Website, Joint initiative of Canadian Universities, 2005-2008 Hare then worked as the psychologist in the prison system in British Columbia (British Columbia Penitentiary) for eight months, an area in which he had no particular qualification or training; indeed he would later recount in Without Conscience that some prisoners were able to manipulate him.Robert Hare: Early Experience Katherine Ramsland Hare then moved to London, Ontario where he completed his PhD (1963) at the University of Western Ontario with a dissertation on the effects of punishment on behaviour. His research led him to The Mask of Sanity by American psychiatrist Hervey M. Cleckley, which played a pivotal role in the concept of psychopathy he applied and developed.Awards - R.D. Hare Lifetime Achievement Award Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy Hare then returned to Vancouver, British Columbia, working as a professor at the UBC’s psychology department, where he would stay for 30 years until retirement, and undertaking research at the same prison he had previously worked in. He concluded that the reason some prisoners seemed not to change their behavior in response to punishment was because they were psychopaths. He recalls, \\"I happened to get into an area that nobody else was working in\\". Hare has said of himself and his wife Averil that family and the loss of family (their daughter Cheryl died from multiple sclerosis in 2003) \\"defines an awful lot about who Averil and I are.\\"Awards - Cheryl Wynne Hare Award Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy Averil, his wife, is a researcher and prominent social worker in Canada specializing in child abuse and child welfare. In the 1970s he published Psychopathy: Theory and Research, summarizing the state of the field, and became internationally influential in reviving and shaping the concept. Hare retired in 2000, closing his psychopathy research lab at the University of British Columbia. In 2010, he was awarded the Canadian Psychological Association's Donald O. Hebb Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology as a Science. The same year, he was named a member of the Order of Canada. ResearchCauses of psychopathy= Hare's research on the causes of psychopathy focused initially on whether such persons show abnormal patterns of anticipation or response (such as low levels of anxiety or high impulsiveness) to aversive stimuli ('punishments' such as mild but painful electric shocks) or pleasant stimuli ('rewards', such as a slide of a naked body). Further, following Cleckley, Hare investigated whether the fundamental underlying pathology is a semantic affective deficit - an inability to understand or experience the full emotional meaning of life events. While establishing a range of idiosyncrasies in linguistic and affective processing under certain conditions, the research program has not confirmed a common pathology of psychopathy. Hare's contention that the pathology is likely due in large part to an inherited or 'hard wired' deficit in cerebral brain function remains speculative. Hare has defined sociopathy as a condition distinct from psychopathy, caused by growing up in an antisocial or criminal subculture rather than being marked by a basic lack of social emotion or moral reasoning. He has also regarded the DSM-IV diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder as separate to his concept of psychopathy, as it did not list the same underlying personality traits. He suggests that ASPD would cover several times more people than psychopathy, and that while the prevalence of sociopathy is not known it would likely cover considerably more people than ASPD. =Assessment tools= Frustrated by a lack of agreed definitions or rating systems of psychopathy, including at a ten-day international North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) conference in France in 1975, Hare began developing a Psychopathy Checklist. Produced for initial circulation in 1980, the same year that the DSM changed its diagnosis of sociopathic personality to Antisocial Personality Disorder, it was based largely on the list of traits advanced by Cleckley, with whom Hare corresponded over the years. Hare redrafted the checklist in 1985 following Cleckley's death in 1984, renaming it the Hare Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R). It was finalised as a first edition in 1991, when it was also made available to the criminal justice system, which Hare says he did despite concerns that it was not designed for use outside of controlled experimental research. It was updated with extra data in a 2nd edition in 2003. The PCL-R was reviewed in Buros Mental Measurements Yearbook (1995), as being the \\"state of the art\\" both clinically and in research use. In 2005, the Buros Mental Measurements Yearbook review listed the PCL-R as \\"a reliable and effective instrument for the measurement of psychopathy\\" and is considered the 'gold standard' for measurement of psychopathy. However, it is also criticised. Hare has accused the DSM's ASPD diagnosis of 'drifting' from clinical tradition, but his own checklist has been accused of in reality being closer to the concept of criminologists William and Joan McCord than that of Cleckley; Hare himself, while noting his promotion of Cleckley's work for four decades, has distanced himself somewhat from Cleckley's work. Hare is also co-author of derivatives of the PCL: the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV) (still requires a clinical interview and review of records by a trained clinician), the P-Scan (P for psychopathy, a screening questionnaire for non- clinicians to detect possible psychopathy), the Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV) (to assess youth and children exhibiting early signs of psychopathy), and the Antisocial Process Screening Device (originally the Psychopathy Screening Device; a questionnaire for parents/staff to fill out on youth, or in a version developed by others, for youth to fill out as self- report). Hare is also a co-author of the Guidelines for a Psychopathy Treatment Program. He has also co-developed the 'B-Scan' questionnaires for people to rate psychopathy traits in others in the workplace. Hare was involved in a controversy in 2010 in which he threatened legal action if a peer-reviewed psychology article on the PCL was published that he claimed misrepresented his views. The paper eventually was published after a three- year delay. =Impact= The Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised is sometimes used as a standard instrument for researchers and clinicians, especially in forensic settings such as prisons or high secure psychiatric units. The measures play an important role in recent risk-for-violence instruments. The PCL-R and PCL:SV have been found to be strong predictors of recidivism, violence and response to therapeutic intervention, though some studies have attributed this largely to the inclusion in the measure of past offending history. The ability of Hare's concept of psychopathy to explain or predict crime has also been criticised, for example by Glenn D. Walters a long-serving US forensic clinical psychologist and Associate Professor of Criminal Justice.  Popular science  Hare wrote a popular science bestseller published in 1993 titled Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us (reissued 1999). He describes psychopaths as 'social predators', while pointing out that most don't commit murder. One philosophical review described it as having a high moral tone yet tending towards sensationalism and graphic anecdotes, and as providing a useful summary of the assessment of psychopathy but ultimately avoiding the difficult questions regarding internal contradictions in the concept or how it should be classified.Without conscience: the disturbing world of the psychopaths among us Robert D. Hare, 1 Nov 1993 Hare also co-authored the bestselling Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work (2006) with organizational psychologist and human resources consultant Paul Babiak, a portrayal of the disruptions caused when psychopaths enter the workplace. The book focuses on what Hare refers to as the \\"successful psychopath\\", who can be charming and socially skilled and therefore able to get by in the workplace. This is by contrast with the type of psychopath whose lack of social skills or self-control would cause them to rely on threats and coercion and who would probably not be able to hold down a job for long. Hare appeared in the 2003/4 award-winning documentary film The Corporation, discussing whether his criteria for psychopathy could be said to apply to modern business as a legal personality, appearing to conclude that many of them would apply by definition.The Corporation Transcripts and Extras - Hear more from... Hare. However, in a 2007 edition of Snakes in Suits, Hare contends that the filmmakers took his remarks out of context and that he does not believe most corporations would meet all the necessary criteria in practice.Hare & Babiak, p. 95 Hare's views are recounted with some skepticism in the 2011 bestseller The Psychopath Test by British investigative journalist Jon Ronson, to which Hare has responded. Hare served as a consultant for Jacob M. Appel's Mask of Sanity (2017), a novel about a high-functioning sociopath.

He entered Kerala politics through Kerala Congress in 1968. In 1970, Joseph contested and won his first election from Thodupuzha to the legislative assembly. He won these elections on nine occasions (1970, 1977, 1980, 1982, 1987, 1996, 2006, 2011, 2016). He contested to Loksabha at Moovattupuzha and Idukki in 1989 and 1991, but was unsuccessful. In 1979 he parted ways with Kerala congress leader K. M. Mani to form a new party, Kerala Congress (Joseph). In 1985 Kerala congress leaders K. M. Mani (from Kerala Congress (M)), P. J. Joseph from Kerala Congress (Joseph), R. Balakrishna Pillai (from Kerala Congress (B)) and their parties merged forming the united Kerala Congress. This party split in 1987. P. J. Joseph continued in United Democratic Front (UDF) till 1989. Issue raised in Moovattupuzha loksabha seat joseph left the alliance and joined to LDF. Since 1991 Joseph's party became part of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) as an alliance. In 2010, after 23 years, Joseph's party again merged with Kerala Congress (M) and a alliance member of UDF. He held various ministerial positions within the Government of Kerala: the first time was in 1978 as Home Minister in A. K. Antony's ministry. Joseph was also Revenue minister twice in K. Karunakaran's ministry between 1981-1982 and 1982-1987, and Education minister between 1996-2001 at E. K. Nayanar's ministery. He was short term PWD minister in V.S. Achuthanandan's ministery in 2006 and 2010. On 30 April 2010, Joseph resigned from the LDF government and declared his party's merger with K. M. Mani's party. After UDF's win in Kerala Legislative Assembly's election in 2011, Oommen Chandy became Chief Minister of Kerala. Joseph was appointed minister for the 7th time, now with the portfolio of irrigation; he completed his term in 2016. Contributions M. A. Agriculture social and political worker P J Joseph is creating an NGO promoting organic agricultural activities. Joseph instituted the Gandhian Studies Centre and the Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development. The former is a registered NGO committed to the development and empowerment of the marginalised section including farmers, unemployed, women, and children from the backward communities etc., irrespective of their caste and political affiliations. The latter concentrates on training and research for agriculture, animal husbandry and rural development. Resignation from Cabinet Joseph resigned from the Kerala Cabinet on 4 November 2006 as he was accused of misbehaviour with a lady co-passenger on a Kingfisher flight. He was acquitted by court on 11 May 2009 due to insufficient evidence. He attributed the allegation to a political vendetta by his detractors in the opposition MLA groups, who had been expelled from his party and people who had tried to criticise him in connection with alleged irregularities in the implementation of a Housing Scheme for registrations called \\"Maitri\\" during his ministerial term during 1996–2001. Election Victory In the Kerala assembly election of 2011, Joseph defeated Joseph Augustine of LDF by a margin of 22,868 votes. He joined the UDF ministry led by Oommen Chandy as the Minister for Irrigations.

She served as the Chief Minister of Goa, Daman and Diu on two occasions, and also was the President of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party. She is the first (and as of 2020, the only) woman to serve as the Chief Minister of Goa, Daman and Diu. Shashikala Gurudatt Kakodkar, on her birthday in 2011 Early life and background Shashikala Kakodkar was born on 7 January 1935 at Pernem, Goa, Portuguese India, to Dayanand and Sunandabai Bandodkar as their eldest child. Her younger siblings were Usha Vengurlekar, Kranti Rao, Jyoti Bandekar and Siddharth Bandodkar. Kakodkar completed her elementary education from the Mushtifund School and completed her matriculation from the People's High School in Panaji. At age 11, she participated in Goa's liberation movement by shouting patriotic slogans, and was beaten by Portuguese police officers for doing so. She graduated from Karnatak University, Dharwad, with a Bachelor of Arts degree, where she studied anthropology, sociology and history. She completed her postgraduate M.A. degree from Mumbai's Elphinstone College. In 1963, the first democratically held elections to the Legislative Assembly of Goa, Daman and Diu led to her father Dayanand Bandodkar's election as the first chief minister. That year, she married Gurudatt Kakodkar, and was appointed as the general manager of the Bandodkar Group of Companies in 1968. She was also a member of the Youth Red Cross Society, All India Women's Conference and the Central Social Welfare Board. She built her power base around the Government Primary Teachers' Association. Entry into politics Shashikala Kakodkar was engaged in social work ever since her return from Mumbai after obtaining her postgraduate education. She contested the 1967 Goa, Daman & Diu Legislative Assembly election from the Ponda constituency as a candidate of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and won by a huge majority, making her the second woman member of the Goa, Daman & Diu Legislative Assembly. In the 1972 Goa, Daman & Diu Legislative Assembly election, Kakodkar successfully contested as a Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party candidate from the Bicholim constituency. =Minister of State= Following her victory in the 1972 Assembly elections, she was appointed as a Minister of State in the government led by her father, Chief Minister Dayanand Bandodkar. She held the portfolios of Education, Public Health, Social Welfare, Public Assistance, Provedoria and Small Savings. On 12 August 1973, her father died in office, and the legislators of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party unanimously selected her as the next Chief Minister. Tenure as Chief MinisterFirst Shashikala Kakodkar Ministry= Shashikala Kakodkar was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Goa, Daman and Diu on 13 August 1973 at 11:20 p.m. by the then- Lieutenant governor of Goa, Daman and Diu Sisirkumar Banerjee at the Raj Bhavan. Along with Kakodkar, Pratapsingh Rane and A. K. S. Usgaonkar were sworn in as Cabinet Ministers. Her own post of Minister of State was kept vacant till the end of the term. Kakodkar also succeeded Bandodkar as the President of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and held the charge of both these posts until the 1977 Goa Legislative Assembly election.goaprintingpress.gov.in/downloads/7374/7374-21-SII-EOG-1.rtf Kakodkar took over the 11 portfolios held over by her father Dayanand Bandodkar, and created four more. They included General Administration, Secretariat Administration, Home, Finance, Confidential & Vigilance Department, Industry, Public Works Department, Education, Information & Tourism, Public Health, Small Savings, Public Assistance, Provedoria, Social Welfare, and Goa Archives. The portfolios of A. K. S. Usgaonkar and Pratapsingh Rane were left untouched. Usgaonkar who was a freedom fighter and a businessman had five portfolios of Planning, Development, Irrigation & Power, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry. Rane who was a political novice had eight portfolios of Law & Judiciary, Labour, Legislative Affairs, Revenue, Local Self Government, Housing & Junta, Civil Supplies and Food. As Kakodkar took over the reins of the government, she accepted the mistakes and shortfalls of the Dayanand Bandodkar regime in a bid to win the support of his critics. She vowed to carry forward the unfinished task of her father, in order to retain Bandodkar's supporters. Aureliano Fernandes states that unlike Bandodkar, Shashikala emerged as an efficient administrator. Fernandes further states that Kakodkar was less of an extrovert than her father, and consequently was far less accessible. She was initially seen as \\"Bandodkar's daughter\\", but soon emerged as a leader in her own right. This was evident from the victory of Ramakant Khalap, who was the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party's candidate in the Mandrem constituency by-election which was vacant following the demise of Dayanand Bandodkar. Kakodkar also scripted history when the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party candidate Luta Ferrao defeated Dr. Wilfred de Souza in the historic by-election in the Benaulim constituency in 1974. In a marked departure from the earlier stand taken by her party, Kakodkar declared that the question of Goa's merger with Maharashtra was a dead issue, and that both Marathi and Konkani were the official languages of Goa. Kakodkar established the Economic Development Corporation of Goa, Daman & Diu (now the Economic Development Corporation – EDC, Goa) in March 1975. She also established the Goa Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education in 1975.http://www.gbshse.gov.in/documents/gbcitizen.pdf Shashikala Kakodkar's government also took steps towards land reforms. Her government enacted the Goa, Daman and Diu Mundkars (Protection from Eviction) Act, 1975 and the Goa, Daman and Diu Agricultural Tenancy (5th Amendment) Act, 1976. The Supreme Court of India upheld the constitutional validity of the Goa, Daman and Diu Agricultural Tenancy (5th Amendment) Act, 1976 in Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu v. Lakshmibai Narayan Patil.1990 AIR 1771, https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1201943/ Some of the other important legislation enacted by the first Shashikala Kakodkar Ministry include the Goa, Daman & Diu Irrigation Act, 1973; Goa, Daman & Diu Chit Funds Act, 1973; Goa, Daman & Diu Barge tax Act, 1973; Goa, Daman & Diu Highways Act, 1974; Goa, Daman & Diu Town and Country Planning Act, 1974; Goa, Daman & Diu Motor Vehicles Act, 1974; Goa, Daman & Diu Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board Act, 1975; Goa, Daman & Diu Public Gambling, Act 1976 and the Goa, Daman & Diu Habitual Offenders Act, 1976. Shashikala Kakodkar was criticised by the opposition for alleged favouritism towards her husband Gurudatt Kakodkar in granting transport and cement licenses and tyre dealerships. The opposition had also alleged that the structural design of the Kala Academy was given to her brother-in-law Sharad Vengurlekar. However, none of these charges could be proved. Kakodkar was also accused of giving maximum government advertisements to the Marathi fortnightly Sameer, of which her husband was the editor. Kakodkar's tenure say a more accommodating approach towards Konkani and a gradual shift from the pro-Marathi stance which was earlier adhered to by the MGP. Fernandes argues that this shift was a result of political exigency, given the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party's victory in the 1974 by-election in Benaulim constituency. In January 1974, Kakodkar's cabinet made Marathi compulsory in all English medium primary schools to the exclusion of Konkani. This move was criticised by the Konkani Bhasha Mandal as a back-door policy to impose Marathi. Kakodkar's style of decision making basically centred around the Chief Minister and she heavily relied on a coterie for advise which included her husband Gurudatt Kakodkar. Two MLAs of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, Jaisingrao Rane and Punaji Achrekar resigned, protesting against Kakodkar's decision-making style without consulting the party rank and file. Pratapsingh Rane also resigned from the government and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, prior to the 1977 Goa Legislative Assembly election. He joined the Indian National Congress. It was in these circumstances that Shashikala Kakodkar led the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party in the 1977 Goa Legislative Assembly election. =Second Shashikala Kakodkar ministry= In the Assembly elections of 1977 which were held after the Emergency, Kakodkar faced a challenge leading the party. The resignation of her cabinet Minister Pratapsingh Rane and MLAs Jaisingrao Rane and Punaji Achrekar; allegations of corruption and favouritism were the major challenges faced by Kakodkar. In her manifesto, Kakodkar spoke against the Emergency and the demand for full-fledged statehood to Goa. Her manifesto contained the issue of developing Konkani language (while continuing support to Marathi as an important state language). She also promised an efficient administration, rapid socio-economic development, rise in standard of living, balanced regional development, a High Court for Goa and extension of education, health and agricultural productivity. Shashikala Kakodkar battled against the odds and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party once again managed to come back to power, winning 15 seats out of the total 30. Sarto Esteves cites Kakodkar's leadership capacities as the reason for the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party forming the government in 1977. Minister A. K. S. Usgaonkar faced a shock defeat in his Pale, Goa constituency. However, those who had rebelled and deserted the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party on issues of merger and Marathi, were soundly defeated. They included Jaisingrao Rane, Punaji Achrekar, Krishnanath Baburao Naik, Pandurang Purushottam Shirodkar and Janardan Jagannath Shinkre. Shashikala Kakodkar successfully retained her Bicholim seat and formed the government with the backing of two independent candidates, Makanbhai Morarji Bhatela of Daman and Narayan Fugro of Diu. Kakodkar was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Goa, Daman and Diu for the second time on 7 June 1977. Kakodkar's cabinet included Shankar Laad and Vinayak Dharma Chodankar as Cabinet Ministers, while Raul Hilario Fernandes was appointed as a Minister of State. Narayan Fugro was appointed as the Speaker and Makanbhai Morarji Bhatela the Deputy Speaker. In her second Ministry too, Kakodkar held the majority of portfolios including Home, Finance (including Small Savings), Personnel & Administrative Reforms, Industries (including Weights and Measures), Planning, Development (including Rural Development & Cooperation), Education (including Archives), Social Welfare, Public Assistance & Provedoria, Information & Tourism, Public Works Department (including Water Supply), Inland Waterways and Town & Country Planning. Shankar Vishveshwar Laad was allocated the portfolios of Law & Judiciary, Legislative Affairs, Labour, Revenue (including Forests) and Urban Development (including Municipalities and excluding Town and Country Planning). Vinayak Dharma Chodankar was given the portfolios of Agriculture (including Animal Husbandry and Fisheries), Irrigation (Major, Medium & Minor), Power and also Food, Civil Supplies & Price Control. Minister of State Raul Hilario Fernandes held the portfolios of Education (including Archives), Information & Tourism, Social Welfare and also the portfolio of Public Assistance & Provedoria. After being sworn in, Kakodkar informed the media that her immediate task was to pursue the statehood issue with the Government of India. To curb unemployment in Goa, Kakodkar established 11 industrial estates during her second term as the Chief Minister. In 1977, Kakodkar's government beautified the Ponda Fort at Farmagudi, Goa and installed an equestrian statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji there. The plaque unveiled after the inaugurating of Shivaji's statue at the Ponda Fort, Farmagudi In her second tenure, Kakodkar faced rebellion within her party after an initially peaceful tenure of about one year. First-time MLAs Dilkush Desai and Dayanand Narvekar initiated a rebellion within the M. G. Party demanding that the party's Executive Body be scrapped and fresh elections be held to the body. Subsequently, they demanded the resignation of Chief Minister Kakodkar. As a result of their anti-party activities, the M. G. Party's Executive Body served a show-cause notice upon MLAs Desai and Narvekar. When the M. G. Party's Executive met on 21 January 1979, Chief Minister Kakodkar stated how both the MLAs had engaged in anti-party activities since June 1978. Kakodkar also spoke about the manner in which MLAs Dilkush Desai and Dayanand Narvekar made irresponsible remarks, took an anti- government stance in the Legislative Assembly and engaged in attempts to destabilise the government. On 26 January 1978, a meeting was organised in Dilkush Desai's Rivona constituency to inform the people about their MLA's anti-party activities. Shashikala Kakodkar stated in the meeting that if need be, she was ready to sit in the opposition but would never concede before selfish politics. In the same meeting, Kakodkar's Law Minister Shankar Vishveshwar Laad also condemned the actions of MLAs Dilkush Desai and Dayanand Narvekar. Laad further stated that the manner in which the pro-poor Communidades (Amendment) Bill was opposed by the duo along with the opposition MLAs, was unfortunate. Subsequently, Laad too joined ranks with the rebels. The subsequent Assembly Session saw a series of defeats and humiliations for the government led by Kakodkar. On 16 March 1979, Opposition MLA Ananta Narcinva (Babu) Naik tabled a private member's resolution before the House that the prices of cinema tickets be reduced by 30%. MLAs Dilkush Desai and Dayanand Narvekar supported the resolution as a result of which there was a tie (14 votes each, in favour and against the resolution). Speaker Narayan Fugro used his casting vote in favour of the government (i.e., against the resolution) as a result of which the resolution was defeated. MLAs Dilkush Desai and Dayanand Narvekar voted in favour of the government while four Bills were passed by the Assembly on 21 March 1979. On 23 March 1979, opposition MLA Francisco Sardinha sought leave of the House to introduce an amendment to the Goa, Daman & Diu Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1964. MLAs Dilkush Desai and Dayanand Narvekar voted in favour the leave being granted to introduce the Bill, as a consequence of which the government was defeated in the Assembly over this question. On 30 March 1979, a resolution tabled by Opposition MLA Leo Velho was supported by MLAs Dilkush Desai and Dayanand Narvekar, resulting in a tie (14 votes each, in favour and against the resolution). Speaker Narayan Fugro used his casting vote in favour of the resolution (i.e., against the government). Belekar states that although Speaker Narayan Fugro did use his casting vote in favour of the government on a few subsequent occasions, the process of Fugro's rebellion against Kakodkar may have started on 30 March 1979. On 17 April 1979, the Assembly witnessed a tie (14 votes each, in favour and against) during voting on demands for grants. But by using his casting vote, Speaker Narayan Fugro saved the government. A defeat of the demands for grants would have led to an exit of the Kakodkar government. The same episode was repeated on 18 April 1979 and Speaker Narayan Fugro's casting vote led to the demands for grants being passed. =Exit of Shashikala Kakodkar's Ministry= The tribulations of Shashikala Kakodkar's second Ministry went on in the Assembly Session. The rebellion by MLAs Dilkush Desai and Dayanand Narvekar had reached its last stage and it was almost certain that the duo would join ranks with the Opposition to cause the exit of Shashikala Kakodkar's government. Even if a single additional MLA of the M. G. Party would have joined ranks with the rebels, the government led by Kakodkar would have been in danger. Hence, attempts were rife to obtain the support of another MLA in favour of the rebels. On 19 April 1979, the discussion was held as regards the demands for grants for three departments: Administration of Justice; Land Revenue, Stamps & Registration; and Legislature Secretariat of the Union Territory. Seven MLAs participated in the discussion but the discussion could not be concluded. The House was adjourned to meet again on 20 April 1979. When the House met on Friday, 20 April 1979 at 2:30 p.m., there was a lot of chaos in the House. The Speaker adjourned the House for 14 minutes at 2:40 p.m. When the House met again pursuant to the adjournment, the chaos continued. Subsequently, the Speaker adjourned the House to meet again on Monday, 23 April at 2:30 p.m. The reason behind the din on 20 April 1979 was that Kakodkar's Law Minister Shankar Vishveshwar Laad had joined ranks with the rebels after resigning as a Minister. He along with MLAs Dilkush Desai and Dayanand Narvekar had withdrawn support from the Kakodkar government. MLAs Laad, Desai and Narvekar joined the Opposition and staked a claim to form the government under Laad's leadership. Speaker Narayan Fugro too supported the majority faction and personally met the Lieutenant Governor to intimate the same. As a consequence, the House witnessed an Opposition which had the majority of 17 members (including Speaker Fugro) while the Chief Minister Kakodkar had the support of only 13 MLAs. Hence, the government lost the majority in the House. But Kakodkar did not resign and as a result, chaos happened in the Assembly on 20 April 1979. Chief Minister Kakodkar called on the Lieutenant Governor but refused to resign and both agreed that the Assembly was the appropriate place to hold a trial of strength on 23 April 1979. Kakodkar was desperately in need of one MLA to tilt the balance in her favour and pass the Appropriation Bill and thus save the government. It was under these circumstances that the House met next on Monday, 23 April 1979. As the House met, there was utter chaos in the House. Speaker Fugro was prevented from proceeding towards the Speaker's chair by four Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party MLAs amid loud slogans. The House then had turned into a battleground of sorts. Paperweights, chairs, the Constitution and microphones were hurled at each other. The Speaker's chair was vandalised and even Mahatma Gandhi's bust in the House was not spared. The newspapers then described the incident as a blot on the democratic tradition of the Assembly and also published photographs of the vandalism which occurred in the House. There was much confusion in the House and it was under these circumstances that Speaker Fugro put the cut motion on demands for grants no. 3- Administration of Justice, to vote. The cut motion was accepted and the division of votes was 15–13. The success of the cut motion meant an exit of the Kakodkar government. Subsequently, Speaker Narayan Fugro stood on the podium and amid the din, declared the defeat of the government on the cut motion and adjourned the House sine die. After Speaker Fugro left the House, the Deputy Speaker Makanbhai Morarji Bhatela occupied the Speaker's chair and announced that the House was adjourned to meet again at 2:30 p.m. on 24 April 1979. Subsequently, Speaker Fugro again entered the House and adjourned the House sine die. Kakodkar sat quietly and it was only later that she castigated the behaviour of her MLAs. In a bid to safeguard her position, she is supposed to have declared that she would not accept the Speaker's ruling because it was not made from the Speaker's chair but from the corner of the dais. The Lieutenant Governor P. S. Gill who received the Speaker's report stated that a defeat on the cut motion to budgetary demands was tantamount to a no-confidence motion in the ministry and that he was convinced that Shankar Laad enjoyed the majority. It was not left to the Union Government to take a decision regarding whether Laad should be allowed to form the ministry or whether President's rule should be imposed. Shashikala Kakodkar subsequently rushed to New Delhi with the Deputy Speaker Bhatela, which was seen as an attempt to apparently make the transfer of power in favour of Laad as difficult as possible. She called on the President of India Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, Prime Minister of India Morarji Desai and the Union Home Minister Hirubhai M. Patel probably urging them to dissolve the Assembly and impose President's rule. Nine of Kakodkar's supporters (loyal M. G. Party MLAs) dispatched telegrams to New Delhi to this effect to bolster her case. Shashikala Kakodkar resigned as the Chief Minister on 26 April 1979. On 28 April 1979, President's rule was imposed in Goa, Daman and Diu for six months with a provision for its extension. The then Prime Minister of India Morarji Desai rationalised that political horse trading should not take place in pursuance of forming a new government. The Prime Minister's opinion was criticised by some as being against the established parliamentary tradition of the person commanding the largest majority (Shankar Laad in the present case) being invited to form the government. The Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Ananta Narcinva (Babu) Naik, criticised the imposition of President's Rule by accusing Prime Minister of India Morarji Desai of having \\"squarely slaughtered\\" democracy by not allowing the Shankar Laad group of 17 legislators to form the new government. Shashikala Kakodkar's supporters welcomed the imposition of the President's Rule. Wilfred de Souza, the President of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee, disclosed that the Indian National Congress was parting ways with the Janata Party in Goa for the latter's failure to prevail on the Union Government led by Janata Party's Morarji Desai to allow an alternate government despite Laad's majority. Wilfred de Souza held the General Secretary of the Janata Party G. Y. Bhandare and the Prime Minister's son Kanti Desai responsible for the imposition of President's Rule. In the 1980 Indian general election, Kakodkar played an active role in ensuring the victory of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party candidate Sanyogita Rane Sardesai from the North Goa (Lok Sabha constituency). Rane Sardesai remains the only woman ever elected to the Parliament of India from Goa.  Praise and criticism  Political commentators like Sarto Esteves have lavished praise on Kakodkar for her victory in the 1977 Goa Legislative Assembly election and for her contribution to education, agriculture, industries and social and medical services. Esteves praises her abilities and behaviour which depicted that \\"Goans could ensure political stability and run the administration of the Territory without constant and continual overseeing by the Centre [New Delhi].\\" Other less-generous critics of Kakodkar indict her of running a corruption-prone government, which was particularly dominated by Goa's then-strong transport lobby, and which saw a lot of her fellow Gomantak Maratha Samaj caste members gain predominance in government postings. Towards the end of her tenure, Kakodkar's government was hit by two major agitations—one led by traditional fishermen protesting against a policy which saw mechanised fishing eating majorly into their interests, and another campaign by students demanding a 50% bus fare concession for all bona fide students. The latter was largely successful. Kakodkar's government also faced a major embarrassment after the annual financial budget was leaked in the Marathi daily Gomantak, even before it was placed before the Assembly. =Ramponkar agitation= The Ramponkar agitation by tradition fishermen protested against the mechanisation of fishing. The transition in Goa from traditional to mechanised fishing led to the woes of the ramponkars (traditional fishermen) being unheard. The ramponkars had several complaints against mechanised fishing. Mechanised fishing through fishing trawlers posed a serious threat to the livelihood of ramponkars. In December 1975, the Goemchya Ramponkarancho Ekvott (G. R. E.) was formally established at the Institute Menezes Braganza. In 1976, the Goemchya Ramponkarancho Ekvott (G. R. E.) forwarded the first memorandum to Chief Minister Kakodkar. However, the response of the government failed to respond favourably and accused the G. R. E. of misleading the traditional fishermen. Around this time, the Union Government started various schemes to develop the fishing industry. These schemes were supplemented by government aid and the fishermen were encouraged to seek loans from the banks. The big fishing trawler-owners invested in large-scale fishing for huge profits. The livelihood of the Ramponkars was threatened but the government failed to respond to their woes. In 1976, the ramponkars went on a chain hunger strike for 380 days. The ramponkars were supported by the Opposition Indian National Congress and Janata Party leaders such as Ananta Narcinva (Babu) Naik, Ferdino Rebello, Victoria Fernandes, Evagrio George. Freedom fighter Mohan Ranade also lent his support to the agitation. A citizens' committee was formed and the issue was debated for the first time in the Legislative Assembly. However, no constitutional action could be taken as the Union Government had declared an Emergency. The ramponkars held a 40-day dharna at the chief minister's residence and a demonstration in Panaji. In 1978, the second general body meeting of the Goemchya Ramponkarancho Ekvott (G. R. E.) was held and the organisation undertook several local agitations across Goa against the use of mechanised fishing trawlers. It held a protest march meeting in Panaji demanding a 5-kilometre zone that would be free from trawlers and purseiners. A ban on fishing during monsoons was also demanded. By 1978, the fishing sector in Goa had been highly mechanised and most trawler owners had political connections. A morcha by ramponkars to the Secretariat in Panaji turned violent resulting in stone pelting. When on 27 January 1978, 85 ramponkars were arrested and the stalemate continued, two M. G. Party MLAs Dilkush Desai and Dayanand Narvekar, backed what they called the \\"just demands\\" of the ramponkars and criticised the Central Government as well as the local fisheries Minister. The trawler owners tried to maximise their profits and embarked on a legal battle. In May 1978, they challenged the Portuguese Act of 1897 in the Judicial Commissioner's Court. In his judgment, Justice Tito Menezes was bad as the act was bad as the state government could not follow an ambivalent policy. He opined that night trawling and fishing during monsoons should stop. Following this, there were sporadic protests, agitations, morchas and arrests. The trawlers continued to dredge the bed of the shore as it was 'legal' from their point of view. The trawlers were interested in fishing in fishing within a 2-kilometre zone primarily because this zone was the breeding ground and habitat of most of the species that were demand in the international markets. The Goemchya Ramponkarancho Ekvott (G. R. E.) realised that a local struggle would not yield the desired results and hence decided to associate with the national leaders. In 1978, they formed they formed the National Forum for Catamaran and Country Boat Fishermen Rights and Marine Life (N. F. F.). The G. R. E. was affiliated to it. The state government patronised the trawlers and developed fish-landing jetties. In July 1978, Matanhy Saldanha was appointed the Chairman of the N. F. F. Memorandums were submitted to the Prime Minister of India, Union Fisheries Minister and all Members of the Parliament. For the first time, the issue was debated in the Parliament of India and a representative of the N. F. F. was sent to New Delhi to demand a Central Marine Bill. In September 1978,a delegation of the N. F. F. was informed that a model bill would be circulated in all the fishing states to introduce a legislation in their respective Vidhan Sabhas. In 1979, Matanhy Saldanha was jailed on false charges and later acquitted by the Additional Sessions Judge. By 1980, the ramponkars had renewed their agitation against non-fishing vessels and mechanised trawlers that caught juvenile mackerels and sardines against Order No. 21-8-81-FSH/6. This was one of the provisions incorporated in the Goa, Daman and Diu Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1980. In 1980, the Union Government led by Indira Gandhi circulated to all the States a draft of the Marine Regulation Bill which was to be enacted in the respective Vidhan Sabhas, because fisheries was a subject in the State List. Meanwhile, clashes between the ramponkars and trawler owners worsened as the latter demanded the implementation of the Bill. There was clashes and the rampons were burnt in Velsao, Cansaulim, Benaulim and Betalbatim. The failure of the Kakodkar government to handle the agitation was one of the reasons for the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party's defeat in the 1980 Goa Legislative Assembly election. =50% bus fare concession movement= The other major movement faced by the Shashikala Kakodkar Ministry was the movement by students demanding a 50% bus fare concession for all bona fide students. In 1978, the All Goa Students' Union and the All India Students' Organization, Goa unit, launched a movement demanding concession in bus fares for all bona fide students. The student community in Goa felt that all students should get a 50% concession in bus fares like fellow students in other states of India. The private bus owner's lobby led by the All Goa Bus Owners' Association was very powerful then and also had the backing of the Kakodkar-led government. The student bodies demanded that the government should provide a concession of 50% for all bona fide students in Goa. On 29 December 1978, the students issued a press note announcing their decision to pay only concessional fare from January 1979 should the government delay their demand. They fixed the concessional fare table and set up a committee to deal with any complaints of resistance from bus operators. Student commuters were told to immediately report any resistance to student representatives. The agitation spread across Goa like wildfire. Buses were burnt as violence erupted. Bandhs were observed and students held protest marches. The students braved lathi charges and tear gas. Student leaders such as Desmond D'Costa were detained too. But after hectic parleys, the Kakodkar government finally conceded to the demand of the students on 12 January 1979. Many leaders of the 50% bus fare concession movement subsequently became towering figures in Goa's public life. These include journalist Sandesh Prabhudesai; lawyers such Aires Rodrigues and Satish Sonak; District & Sessions Judge Desmond D'Costa, etc. =Budget leak incident= The Marathi daily Gomantak had always stook soldily behind the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party in its propaganda for merger with Maharashtra. The generally very cordial relations with Gomantak however soured during the last years of the Kakodkar government. Fernandes states that during Kakodkar's last years in regime, there is a reason to believe that the editor of Gomantak tried to influence the functioning of the government. When Chief Minister Kakodkar refused to give in, the Gomantak attempted to embarrass Kakodkar by publishing the entire budget of 1978–79 in the newspaper even before it was presented before the Assembly. The Opposition criticised the government and stated that the leakage of the budget had proved the government's inefficiency as it was unable to guard the most important secret document of the administration. The Opposition demanded the resignation of the government led by Kakodkar. Shashikala Kakodkar alleged that the budget leak was a conspiracy against her government and demanded that it the culprits be severely punished. The accreditation of the reporters were withdrawn and some employees of the Government Printing Press were suspended after an enquiry. This budget leak deteriorated the image of the government. Post-1980 politics After the exit of the Kakodkar Ministry in 1979, President's rule was imposed on 28 April 1979. Fresh elections to Legislative Assembly would decide the next Chief Minister of Goa. Prior to the 1980 Goa Legislative Assembly election, many changes took place in Goa's political arena. The two M. G. Party MLAs who had played a pivotal role in the ouster of the Kakodkar government were Dayanand Narvekar and Dilkush Desai. Narvekar joined the Indian National Congress in December 1979 and was soon followed by Desai. At that time, the Indian National Congress in Goa was known as the Indian National Congress (Urs) faction because after the Indian National Congress split of 1978, the Congress Legislature Party in the Goa, Daman and Diu Legislative Assembly identified itself with the Indian National Congress (Urs). The Indian National Congress (Urs) as a political party in Goa was led by its President Wilfred de Souza, who was not a MLA. The Indian National Congress led by Indira Gandhi (Indira Congress) also had its presence in Goa and was led by Purushottam Kakodkar. But as far as the 1980 Goa Legislative Assembly election were concerned, the Indian National Congress (Urs) (Urs Congress) as well as the Indira Congress had an understanding between themselves. The Indian National Congress (Urs) led by Wilfred de Souza had a seat sharing agreement with the Indira Congress and the latter was given 6 constituencies. The Indian National Congress (Urs) contested in 22 constituencies while 1 constituency was left for an independent candidate. Indira Gandhi addressed a public meeting on 12 December 1979 at Panaji's Azad Maidan grounds where she apologised to the people for imposing a state of Emergency in 1975. She expressed the need for developing Goa without harming its natural beauty. The 1980 Assembly Elections, the Indian National Congress (Urs) emerged victorious in 20 out of the 22 constituencies in which it contested. While the Indira Congress won no seats, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party secured victory in only 7 constituencies. The independents won 3 seats and Shashikala Kakodkar was defeated in the Bicholim constituency by Harish Narayan Prabhu Zantye, an independent candidate. Pratapsingh Rane became the Chief Minister of Goa and Dayanand Narvekar secured a berth in his Ministry. In a subsequent cabinet expansion, Harish Zantye was also included as a Minister. The 1980 Indian general election resulted in the Indira Congress emerging victorious. Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister of India and many members of the Indian National Congress (Urs) attempted to rejoin the Indira Congress. The Indian National Congress (Urs) government in Goa too started negotiations for rejoining the Indian National Congress led by Indira Gandhi. The Goa Pradesh Executive of the Indian National Congress (Urs) passed a resolution deciding to merge with the Indian National Congress. The merger occurred in the second week of February 1980. On 12 February 1980, Chief Minister Pratapsingh Rane announced that the government in Goa was that of the Indira Congress. =Entry into the Indian National Congress= When the Indian National Congress (Urs) faction in Goa merged itself with the Indian National Congress led by Indira Gandhi, 5 MLAs of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (Vishnu Rama Naik, Deu Mandrekar, Narsinhbai Tandel, Vinayak Chodankar and Somjibhai Solanki) also joined the Indian National Congress in 1980. On 20 March 1980, A. R. Antulay announced in New Delhi that Shashikala Kakodkar, the President of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, had joined the Indian National Congress along with her followers. On 22 March 1980, Kakodkar stated that the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party's Executive had agreed for the merger of the party within the Indian National Congress. This would mean the demise of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party. Kakodkar stated that the reason behind her joining the Indian National Congress was that she wanted to be in the mainstream. Kakodkar's announcement was opposed by many senior leaders of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party. On 23 March 1980, a meeting was held under the leadership of Mukund Shinkre (former Lok Sabha Member of Parliament) where the party workers and leaders including M. S. Prabhu decided not to permit the merger of the party. A temporary committee was established under the Presidency of Mukund Shinkre. The two MLAs of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (who had not joined the Indian National Congress) opposed Kakodkar's stance and made every attempt to ensure that the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party survived. These two MLAs were Ramakant Khalap and Babuso Gaonkar. Ramakant Khalap was appointed as the Opposition leader in the Assembly. Belekar points out that if the merger of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party had occurred in 1980, the Legislative Assembly would virtually have no Opposition members at all. The Assembly then had 20 MLAs of the Indian National Congress and 7 MLAs of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, while the remaining 3 were Independents. If Khalap and Gaonkar would have joined the Indian National Congress along with the rest 5 MLAs of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, there would exist no Opposition at all in the Assembly. Kakodkar aimed to secure positions within the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee organisation for herself and her supporters. But Wilfred de Souza threatened to resign if he was deprived of the position of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee's President. Kakodkar was not comfortable in the Indian National Congress and she quit the party. =Formation of the Bhausaheb Bandodkar Gomantak Party and return to the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party= Kakodkar decided to return to the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party. The party was then led by Mukund Shinkre. A historic meeting to facilitate Kakodkar's return to the party was organised by the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party's stalwarts such as Dr. Wilfred Menezes Mesquita, J. J. Rodrigues and Shankar Bandekar. But the talks failed and Kakodkar established a new political party called the Bhausaheb Bandodkar Gomantak Party of which she became the President. Kakodkar contested the 1984 Assembly elections from both Canacona and Marcaim constituencies as an independent candidate but lost the elections. Kakodkar rejoined the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party by merging the Bhausaheb Bandodkar Gomantak Party into the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party. =The 1989 elections and formation of the Progressive Democratic Front Government= The 1989 elections to the first Goa State Legislative Assembly were held for 40 constituencies on 22 November 1989. Since the Indian National Congress managed to achieve a wafer-thin majoriy with 21 seats, Pratapsingh Rane was elected as the Chief Minister of Goa by the Congress Legislature Party. Rane was sworn in as the first Chief Minister of the newly established State of Goa on 11 January 1990. Rane faced a dilemma as there were too many aspirants for ministerial posts. Dr. Luis Proto Barbosa reluctantly accepted the Speaker's post. Rane decided to expand his cabinet in two phases and assured his legislators that he would soon expand the Cabinet after the Budget Session. But Rane' strategy did not succeed and his promise of expanding the Cabinet after the Budget Session in March 1990 was shattered as a group of seven MLAs led by Speaker Barbosa split from the Indian National Congress to christen itself as the Goa People's Party (GPP). The GPP staked claim to form a new Ministry with the support of the 18 Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party MLAs and Independent MLA Ananta Narcinva (Babu) Naik. The GPP consisted of MLAs dissatisfied due to their exclusion from the Cabinet and included Dr. Luis Proto Barbosa (Speaker), Churchill Alemao, Farrel Furtado, Mauvin Godinho, Somnath Zuwarkar, Luis Alex (Mama) Cardozo and John Baptist Gonsalves. The coalition government of the GPP, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party and an Independent was named as the Progressive Democratic Front (PDF) Government. After a hectic political transition by making Churchill Alemao the interim Chief Minister of Goa on 27 March 1980 for a period of just 17 days (Alemao was the Chief Minister from 27 March 1980 to 13 April 1990) and appointing Ramakant Khalap as the Deputy Chief Minister, Speaker Barbosa was made the Chief Minister of Goa. Union Minister George Fernandes played an instrumental role in the formation of the PDF Government. Dr. Luis Proto Barbosa resigned as the Speaker and was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Goa on 13 April 1990. Shashikala Kakodkar was sworn in as a Minister in the cabinet headed by Dr. Barbosa. Kakodkar was allotted the portfolios of Education, Art & Culture, Transport and Fisheries. =Contribution as Education Minister= Kakodkar's tenure as Education Minister is widely noted for her policy on the medium of instruction for primary level schools across Goa. Kakodkar's policy of providing government grants to primary (Class I to IV) schools in Goa mandated that grants would be allotted only to schools imparting primary level education in Konkani or Marathi. The policy would be implemented from June 1990. Kakodkar managed to convince the then Chief Minister of Goa Dr. Luis Proto Barbosa and the Official Language Minister Churchill Alemao who too supported the decision. As a consequence of Kakodkar's policy, many primary schools changed their medium of instruction to Konkani or Marathi from English. 130 primary schools operated by the Church's Diocesan Society of Education overnight changed their medium of instruction from English to Konkani. Kakodkar also decided not to permit the establishment of any new primary schools imparting education in English, but this policy was not adhered to by the subsequent governments. On 4 December 1990, Shashikala Kakodkar along with the Deputy Chief Minister Ramakant Khalap and three other Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party Ministers from the PDF Government resigned after differences within Goa's first coalition government. Chief Minister Dr. Luis Proto Barbosa finally resigned on 10 December 1990, before the voting on the no-confidence motion could take place. Post 1990 politics Shashikala Kakodkar was elected to the Goa Legislative Assembly in the 1994 elections from the Maem constituency as a Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party candidate. In 1999, Kakodkar contested the Goa Legislative Assembly as from the Maem constituency as a Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party candidate but was defeated by Prakash Fadte of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Kakodkar contested her last election unsuccessfully as a Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party candidate from the Maem constituency and was defeated by Harish Zantye of the Indian National Congress. After the defeat in the 2002 elections, Kakodkar did not contest any subsequent election. Other positions held Shashikala Kakodkar served as the Chairperson of the Kala Academy. She was the Chairperson, Goa, Daman and Diu Industrial Development Corporation; Chairperson, Goa, Daman and Diu State Sports Council; Chairperson, Goa Cancer Society; President, Red Cross Committee (Goa Branch) and the Working President of the Marathi Bhavan Nirman Committee. In October 1998, Kakodkar was appointed the Chairperson of the Goa Bal Bhavan. From 1991 to 1992, Kakodkar also served as the Chairperson of the Committee on Petitions and a member of the Committee on Public Undertakings in the Goa Legislative Assembly. Kakodkar served as the President of the Panjim Gymkhana Club, Panaji. Social activism and philanthropy Shashikala Kakodkar also assisted the Goa Football Association in reviving the Bandodkar Gold Trophy. Kakodkar was a patron of many social and religious organisations. In 2006, she participated in the Marathi Bachao Aandolan movement during the tenure of Luizinho Faleiro as Goa's Education Minister against making English a compulsory language at the primary level. Kakodkar was also the convener of the Bharatiya Bhasha Suraksha Manch which subsequently became the Goa Suraksha Manch. Awards and honours Shashikala Kakodkar received an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, the Karnatak University of Dharwad, in 2014. Death Kakodkar died on 28 October 2016 at the Bandodkar House in Altinho, Panaji after a prolonged illness. The Government of Goa declared a 2-day state mourning in her honour. She was cremated on 29 October 2016 at the St. Inez crematorium in Panaji with full state honours.

The area is marketed as the 'Rock lobster capital of Australia'. Dongara is the seat of the Shire of Irwin. At the the shire had a population of 3,569, with 2,782 residing in the contiguous towns of Dongara and Port Denison. History Dongara Flour Mill The place name 'Dongara' is an anglicised rendition of Thung-arra, the local Wattandee people's name for the estuary adjacent to the town, meaning 'sea lion place'. European settlement around the estuary began in 1853 when a harbourmaster, Edward Downes, was stationed there to look out for passing ships. He was employed by Lockier Burges, Edward Hamersley, Samuel Pole Phillips and Bartholomew Urban Vigors' Cattle Company, which was granted 60,000 acres of pastoral leases about 15 kilometres inland. By the 1860s, ex- convict small farmers were occupying the local river flats, and a flour mill (the Irwin or Smith's Mill) was operating. A townsite was surveyed, and in 1871 it became the seat of a local council established that year (now the Irwin Shire Council), and site of a police station and public school. The Anglican Church of St John the Baptist and a Methodist Church were built in the 1880s. In the 1890s, the larger Royal Steam Roller Flour Mill was built on the flats next to the new Midland Railway line that connected the district to Perth. The town slowly developed, and although still a comparatively small village by the time of Federation in 1901, it had several churches, municipal offices and hall, a variety of shops, two hotels, a public school and a railway station. The nearby localities were populated by wheat and sheep farmers, centred on the hamlets of Bookara, Irwin and Strawberry. There was also a small population of fishermen, including several Chinese men, at Port Denison.

Pearlman (June 7, 1925 – January 5, 2019) was an American engineer best known as the founder of ARP Instruments, Inc., one of the early leading American synthesizer manufacturers. Early life Pearlman was born in New York City on June 7, 1925. His father was a movie theatre projector designer and his grandfather made parts for phonograph machines. He grew up building radio sets, inspired by Popular Science and Popular Mechanics magazines, and served in the military briefly following World War II. Following his military service, Pearlman attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts and in 1948, for his senior thesis designed a vacuum tube envelope follower that could extract the envelope of a sound from an instrument. He later audited a Harvard University course taught by one of the inventors of the transistor, Walter Brattain.Trevor Pinch, Frank Trocco, _Analog Days_ , Harvard University Press, 2002 Career Pearlman spent five years designing amplifiers for NASA's Gemini and Apollo programs. He worked at George A. Philbrick Researchers with Roger Noble, and the two later founded analog module and op amp manufacturer Nexus Research Laboratory in Canton, Massachusetts in the early 1960s. Nexus Research Laboratory's business grew to $4 million in annual sales before being acquired by Teledyne, Inc. in 1966.John Taylor, \\"Unsung hero pioneered op amp\\", Taylor Electronics Services.Semiconductor companies, Computerhistory.org In 1969, Pearlman founded ARP Instruments, Inc. (originally Tonus, Inc.) with $100,000 of his own money and matching funds from a small group of investors. The name ARP was derived from Pearlman's initials. ARP entered the fledgling synthesizer industry with the introduction of the ARP 2002, which, with twice as many switch rows on top, became the 2500 analog modular synthesizer. The 2002 was introduced at the Audio Engineering Society (AES) show in Fall 1970, and subsequently competed head-to-head with other leading synthesizer companies of the time. Pearlman eschewed patch cord methodology for interconnecting synthesizer modules, designing instead a system of sliding matrix switches. He also applied his op-amp experience by utilizing dual transistors on a single integrated circuit to overcome temperature gradients and provide very stable oscillators — more stable than other popular synthesizers on the market at the time, namely offerings from Moog Music and Buchla.\\"close encounters of the ARP kind\\", Sound on Sound, August, 1996. The company's next synthesizer, and one of its most popular and commercially successful, was the ARP 2600. The first units were manufactured in early 1971 in small quantities, but by the end of the year the 2600P model was in full production. Eschewing some of the more esoteric modules from the 2500, the 2600 was conceived as both a musical instrument and a didactic tool for learning about electronic music. Instead of the 2500's unreliable and arcane pin matrix, the 2600 used a more traditional patch cord routing architecture that provided users with a clear visual indication of signal flow. The 2600 was produced from 1971 until 1982, the year that ARP ceased to exist as a company. ARP went public in 1973, based on the success of the 2600 and the ARP Odyssey. The company's annual sales peaked at $7 million in 1977, but differences of opinion in the management team, the costly development of the Avatar guitar synthesizer, and product sales figures that fell far short of the company's sales projections led to financial difficulties for the company and its eventual liquidation in September 1981. ARP's demise was financially devastating to Pearlman and his family, who together lost nearly $500,000 in cash and $1 million in paper assets.Mark Vail, Vintage Synthesizers, Miller Freeman, 1993, p. 171 Pearlman went on to found and serve as Chief Executive Officer at Selva Systems Inc., a computer graphics software company. Later, Pearlman advised Way Out Ware's Jim Heintz on the development of the TimewARP 2600 software re-creation of the ARP 2600. This is the only ARP 2600 software re-creation that Pearlman endorsed.\\"Way Out Ware TimewARP 2600\\" Awards In 1978, Worcester Polytechnic Institute presented the Robert H.

Immediately surrounding towns and villages include Bagshot, Deepcut, Windlesham, Camberley, and West End, Woking. It is bounded to the north-west by the M3 motorway and to the north-east by the \\"Lightwater Bypass\\" (A322). To the south-east it is bounded by the \\"Red Road\\" (B311), while to the south-west there are vehicle-testing tracks owned by the Ministry of Defence. The village is adjacent to junction 3 of the M3 motorway. The nearest railway station is at Bagshot, on the line between Ascot and Aldershot. Lightwater is part of the civil parish of Windlesham, which has a population of 17,000 and also includes the neighbouring village of Bagshot. History An 1890 map of the locality. =Development= Prior to development, the natural vegetation was part of the Surrey heathland as seen in Bagshot and Chobham Common. The region has been inhabited since pre- historic times with tumuli in the heathland to the south of the village. In modern times, Lightwater grew as a place with holiday homes in a chalet style for people living in London. Since 1960 it has grown rapidly, with housing estates proliferating in the area just north of Red Road and the military ranges around Greyspot. =Facilities= The town has full medical facilities and veterinary surgery, a library, pubs, a post office, a range of shops and a petrol station. =Transport= Despite Lightwater being larger in size, the nearest railway station is at Bagshot. This reflects the fact that Bagshot used to be a more important town as a staging post on journeys from London to Southampton and the West Country. Lightwater has grown in size as a dormitory settlement in recent times. In the adjacent 1890s map of the area, Bagshot is a notable town while Lightwater is noted as just a farm.  Lightwater Country Park  Lightwater has its own country park, with some of heathland, complete with \\"nature trail\\", together with a leisure centre and visitors centre. The park has a view point, called High Curley, which gives views of about 250 degrees. From this point Bracknell, Ascot Racecourse, the London skyline and Bagshot Park can be seen to the west of the M3. Sport The local senior rugby club is Lightwater Rugby Club.

The hotel was erected at a cost of £13,000 and constructed of cement blocks and brick. The two storey building held fifteen rooms for accommodation on the top floor and more accommodation along with a kitchen, bar, commercial room, saloon and laundry on the ground floor. The building was sewered, with hot and cold water to all rooms, and had an electrical plant installed. In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. The town was flooded in 1932 following torrential rains in the area. The town was left under water for at least a day but the water flowed rapidly away down the Moore River. It was feared at one point that the town dam would burst from the pressure. Roads were cut from washaways and the streets and flooded buildings were left deep in mud with some stock losses, mostly sheep, being reported.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth and East Perthshire later Tayside North from 1979 to 1997. He never held any office in government and was one of the Maastricht Rebels against the embattled administration of John Major during the mid-1990s. Air Cadets Walker began his cadet career in 1942 with 1707 (Dundee) Squadron of the Air Training Corps (ATC). Joining the organisation just a year after its inception, he continued his affinity with the air cadets ever since. He went on to spend a total of nine years in full-time regular RAF service, doing National Service including tours in the Middle East and later started the new Central Gliding School as a flight lieutenant. He has since held several different roles, many of which featured within the Air Cadet gliding fraternity, the largest gliding organisation in the world, culminating in his appointment in the 1990s as President of Air Cadet Gliding and in 2011 becoming the first officer of the RAFVR(T) to be appointed to the rank of group captain.Bill continues to soar with the air cadets, Air Cadet Organisation, 26 May 2011 Parliamentary career Walker stood at Dundee East in the October 1974 general election, coming third. He was first elected in the 1979 general election as the Member of Parliament for Perth and East Perthshire. In 1983, he became MP for the newly formed Tayside North. Walker enjoyed wearing the kilt, and he was one of two MPs who deliberately wore it in Parliament one day in July 1982 to mark the 200th anniversary of the lifting of the ban on wearing tartan, imposed after the 1745 Jacobite rising. He was a staunch Eurosceptic who resigned as vice chair of the Scottish Conservatives in 1992 to vote against the Government's attempts to implement the Maastricht Treaty. He became one of the Maastricht Rebels who repeatedly voted against the Government's attempts to ratify the treaty. In July 1993, despite being seriously ill, he flew down to London for a key vote on Maastricht and was kept hidden from the Government whips until the vote took place; his vote helped to inflict a defeat upon the Government. In 1994, Walker was implicated in the Cash for Questions scandal that involved other Conservative MPs such as Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith. However, in Walker's case the matter was not taken further when it emerged that he had given the cash to charity.The Parliamentary Monitor, Volume 3, Parliamentary Communications, Limited, 1994, page 34 During his years in Parliament, Walker managed to get five Private Member's Bills passed, including the bill which became the Scotch Whisky Act 1988, which gave a boost to the Scottish whisky industry. Walker lost Tayside North when he was defeated by the SNP's John Swinney in 1997. He was elected Deputy Chairman of the Scottish Conservatives in June 2000.'Convincing' win for right-winger, BBC News, 19 June 2000 He was reelected in 2006, serving until 2008.

The island is connected to the continent by a road and a breakwater. Unlike most other Bulgarian Black Sea islands, its infrastructure is completely set up. The island was named after the medieval Monastery of Sts. Quiricus and Julietta, the ruins of which still stand there. The monastery was subordinate to the major stauropegic monastery on the nearby St. Ivan Island. In 1925-1926, a school for fishermen and sailors was built on the island, where only orphans were allowed to study. The school existed for 10 years. In 1936 its base was reorganized to accommodate the Bulgarian Naval Academy. Until recently, the island was a restricted area, where Bulgarian Navy ships were anchored. St. Cyricus Island was demilitarized in the 2000s and is to become a centre of international maritime tourism. As it is a national cultural monument, its heritage will be preserved and the new buildings are required to match the characteristic style of Sozopol.

The South Western Highway runs through the region. It is also a crossing loop on the south-west railway between Armadale and Bunbury. History Before European settlement, the region was inhabited by the Pindjarup people, in whose language \\"Benger\\" may have meant \\"swamp\\" according to some sources (the word Pijar was also used). The explorers Thomas Peel and Stephen Henty travelled through the district in 1835. The area was known as the \\"flats of Mornington\\", and some years later, Mornington Siding was established with a hall, school and shop/post office. Sandalwood from the area was used in the Swan River Colony. In 1887, John Partridge founded a dairy in the area, which is still open today as the White Rocks Museum and Dairy. The town was renamed from Mornington to Benger in 1902, although many geographic names in the area (including the creek near the school) bear the original name.Harvey Tourism - Brunswick Junction.
